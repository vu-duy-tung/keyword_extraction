    "text": "It's hard to believe that the Phoenix area can be home to such good pizza. Even though it is a small chain, Oregano's can proudly lay claim to being one of the best pizza joints in the Valley of the Sun. I try to stop there when I am in the area.  The restaurant is a fun place with kitschy decorations and a loud atmosphere. Think Bucca di Beppo, but with good food and more outdoor seating.  The thin crust pizza comes cut in squares instead of slices, but the thin crust, decadent cheese and tangy sauce makes the extra mess worth it. They offer Chicago Style pan and stuffed pizzas as well.  I prefer sitting at the bar for quicker service and access to flowing brews out of the tap.",

Be prepared to wait for a table (it's a great restaurant!) but once you're inside, you'll be pleasantly surprised.  I've been to this location several times. Small and with limited parking (in the back), it can be a little crowded. But the atmosphere is wonderful! Fairly quiet but with a great energy, the vibe here is unlike any other.  The food is absolutely on point. I most recently ordered a pizza and we were not able to finish it between two people.  If you're in downtown Scottsdale and need to grab a bite to eat, don't pass up Oregano's. A bit on the upscale side, it's well worth a visit!",

The food was not the best. I ordered a deep dish, which being from Chicago I was really hoping it would be good, but It was not. I did not like the flavoring, basil? And it seemed a bit under cooked.  The calamari was rubbery.  I would go back because o know their other menu items are good and its a fun place.  I just won't order the deep dish pizza. I guess nothing compares to Chicago!",

    "text": "We had a weekend visit to Phoenix to catch the Padres Spring training game in Peoria and also the Suns/Hornets game at American Airlines arena about a month ago.   In any case, we ended up in Scottsdale on Friday afternoon and we all had decided to get something to eat. Pizza was the choice and we stopped off at Oregano's. Probably THE best choice that was made that day. The outdoor patio was the location for our afternoon meal. We had to start off with some drinks so beers and cocktails were ordered up and contemplated the menu selections while waiting. Now the food:   Starters: Oregano's Favorite (salad) - Delicious honey vinaigrette dressing and we added some fresh Parmesan to boot. KickBUTT Garlic Bread topped with cheese and marinara on the side was actually KickASS.   Main Course: Veggie Wedgie with Sweet potato fries (ordered by my girlfriend) ...couldn't have asked for anything better. The sandwich was quite large and the foccacia bread was a hit with her. The rest of us shared in the 18-inch pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage, and meatballs. The thin crust was amazing and crispy with the savory toppings to put it over the edge.   Our server was nice and attentive, but our order for a pizza slice, salad, and a beer was incorrect the first time out. She made up for it by letting us keep the wrong order AND brought out the corrections. Now that is what I call customer service!!   Added entertainment value: Seeing cars pull into the small parking lot (which holds about 7 cars max) and watching them maneuver to park and get out of the small lot. We could have sworn we were going to see a little bumper bump or similar but it never did happen.   I wish there were one here in San Diego, but I know that if I find myself back in Arizona, I would definitely visit this place again. The pizza is flat out awesome and it was even better as a late night snack!! Definitely a can't miss dining option!!",

    "text": "It seems like it was just yesterday, but it was more like 25, or 26 years ago when I first stepped foot inside what was once called Lawrence of Oreganos! It was opening day then and the next few weeks tables were easy to garner but that changed, as \"Oregano's\" started to earn its place in the future history of famous Arizona Restaurants. It began to get tougher and tougher to get a table even as we watched this tiny Bistro expand to a mini compound, and soon to be pretty a darn successful regional chain.  Although I have enjoyed hundreds of meals with friends and family during the last 3 decades, and waited as many hours for a table, it has been years since I have been in. That changed last night and although tradition was shattered, I was stoked to be immediately whisked to a big table in the corner with NO WAIT!   So on to last nights visit, I first notice that the dining experience starts in the driveway, the building looks great, and music was in the air. upon entering our greeting was welcoming and efficient. The walk through the dining room was fun, and although a little Disneyesque, it felt like we were entering and old time, big city Italian restaurant, It's pretty, vibrant and smelt delicious.  We were lead to a great big table in the corner and menus placed for us so we could sit and stare at the wall, we took the initiative to scoot around to the back so we could people watch and take in this neat space and vibrant energy. Soon into dinner and coincidentally good friends were seated across from us. That was nice, and its casual enough that standing and talking for a few minutes wasn't a problem for this casual environment.  My buddy said \"wings\" I got this, I said... Italian Gold with a side of the hot sauce were ordered with our beverages. The wings arrived late, after the sandwiches, but they still tasted EXACTLY as I remembered. Delicious. I snuck the order in with beverages cause I knew they took a while. I would have loved to start with them rather then eat along side of entrees. Although blamed on long cooking times ( I knew that) this was the only service mis-step. The rest of our service was so good that we left a fat tip for our friendly server.  Overall everything we ordered was delicious, and prepared well, with the exception of the Cole slaw and Giardinara that came with our sandwiches. The slaw was so finely chopped I thought it was Ice berg lettuce. It was Ice cold and had a unique flavor and I ate it all, it was a more visual and textural thing, and the Giardinara may have been from the bottom of the barrel or just not as I remembered, It was all okra and peppers, just all dark green, Not really a problem just not great. It was especially nice to see that prices are still very reasonable and portions every bit as big as always.  I am not sure why it's been so long since I have been, but It wont be long, till I get back.",

We were seated fairly quickly (considering it as a Saturday night) and our server was super nice. After ordering some drinks and looking through the menu, we decided to order a couple of pizzas and share. Wow! The pizza was great! There was a total of 10 of us, so we ordered two 18\" and one 12\" pizzas. The thin crust was my personal favorite. As good as the pizza was, I definitely want to try a pasta dish next time.  Lastly, the atmosphere was solid. Good food, good drinks, and a nice atmosphere are all you can ask for at a restaurant. Can't wait to come back!",

She was arrogant and didn't believe she needed to write anything down. Not surprisingly someone besides her showed up with wrong order. She blocked me and my 4 year old from getting out as she needed to use bathroom twice. My husband and I waited for refills on our ice tea most of our meal. When she finally did she dropped our bill off without grabbing the extra 12 unnecessary plates we never asked for. I had to ask for boxes with our clearly full table and she took 20 min to run my card. She did not offer any help with to go stuff although we could barely move but she looked at  our stacked boxes up and down and asked my kids if they wanted ice cream. Not ok. I had to ask her for a bag that should have been obvious. This restaurant is great but someone needs to remind her she is in customer service and may need to come down a few notches. I still gave her 20% tipbecause of the food, all though my husband that works at maestros city hall said 10%!!! Everyone else smiled and was friendly as usual. Gretchen may need a little pep talk to be aware of the perception she is giving off.",

There must be something else here that makes this such a popular chain.",

We started with the sliced beef salad, which I did not expect to like but ended up being really good. Also had an order of plain old Spaghetti and meatballs, again, no complaints, and their pizza i always good, got the thin crust this time but have never been disappointed there. Best garlic bread ever!  Service is another area I find good at every Oreganos I visit. Our waitress was cute and personable and my glass did not sit empty (My pet peeve).   Nice place to take the family or your date. Pretty predictably good.",

I've been to at least three different locations...not bad, just not worth the wait or the hype.  For a multitude of reasons I can't always have tomato sauce on my pizza so I'm limited \"white\" or pesto pizza.  They don't have a white pizza, so I'm left with pesto.  In short, the pesto is too salty.  As for everything else I've had (salads, sandwiches)...ok.  However, and heres the thing I don't get...what's up with the waffle fries?  Waaaayyyy too heavy.  How about just fries?  So in summary, not bad, just not great.  And here's they key if there's a wait (like any time after 5:45) It's just not worth it.  Why wait for 30+ minutes to have slightly better than middle of the road food?  Again, maybe I just don't get it.",

You see, my baby and I were rear-ended a few weeks ago and I have a sprained/strained cervical and lumbar spine respectively along with a sprained knee, and was truthfully having great difficulty.  She offered to carry my baby in his carrier all the way out to my car for me.  I felt kind of guilty accepting her offer, but upon her insistence I did.  She even lifted him into the back seat of the car for me.  This is just another example of the kind of people you have on your extremely caring staff!!  Thank you SO MUCH!!!",

I was appreciative of the swamp misters they had on full blast because it was VERy hot that night, but I slipp and went sailing on the concrete from the patio and our waiter wiped off the puddles from our table multiple times. There were only 2 out of 4 seats that were dry enough to sit in at our table BUT we did request the patio so we sucked it up.   I love the atmosphere at this place. Granted I wasn't a fan of the misters, I loved the music and the overhead lighting and the vintage TV in the corner playing old B and W movies. That's pretty cool. I just wish their pasta menu was a bit more of a variety. I was craving some white pasta but my only choice was the basic alfredo... hmph.  I got the Zany Ziti and it was still so delicious. Came in its own bread bowl and i couldn't finish the whole thing. That's how big it was. I still recommend this place especially over something as basic as an Olive Garden or something. I've heard the pizza is THE item to get off the menu. But if you're searching for that super authentic Italian taste may want to try a pasta house.  Always ask for Cylee! He is an outstanding waiter, very personable, and genuinely wants you to enjoy yourselves.",

The waitress was attentive, friendly, and efficient, even tho she said it was only her second day solo. I had a salad with pasta and chicken that I can't wait to go back for. I got the smaller version but still couldn't eat it all. My husband ate every bite if his lasagna and said it was delicious. My son loved his pesto pasta (not the first time he's had it!), but had half of it left to take home. Don't miss Oregano's; it's a reasonably priced meal not to be missed in Scottsdale, but go HUNGRY!",

The stuffed mushrooms were amazing, bursting with flavor and oozing (yes, I said oozing) with cheese. The Pizza was well balanced and the toppings were extremely fresh.  The crust was fine, but nothing super.  Yes, it was better than CPK pizza, but still not the best that I've had (in OC or Phx).  But perhaps that was the down fall. Comparing to other greats ... puts this place at a disadvantage. But if I'm used to only CPK, then I'd be very impressed.  Don't get me wrong, this place has lots going for it and the overall experience was fun and super laid back yet with service that was awesome.  But compared to other pizza places eaten less than 24 hrs ago ... I'd say it isn't worth the long drive if you're coming from South of the 60.",

    "text": "I've enjoyed several meals at Oreganos Pizza Bistro from Tucson to Flagstaff. I've also eaten lunch and dinner at locations from the west valley to the east side. The five stars given here are not just for the quality of the menu options, but also for the consistency exemplified across the chain.  My favorite location has to be the one in Scottsdale. No matter the time of year, the patio is an awesome place to hang out. Plus it was here that I discovered a very unique pizza on their menu. It was so good, I took both of my sons to dinner tonight to share it with them.  The wait time of 30 minutes wasn't as bad as I expected. It is a Saturday night after all, but we didn't arrive until about 7. We were shown our table on time and our server (I think her name was Briana) was excellent. As was the staff that cleared items during the meal.  Before the pizzas arrived, I suggested the calamari appetizer. My oldest didn't argue the choice. My youngest wasn't sure cause he'd never tried it before. Now, he loves calamari! Oreganos doesn't use the more common rings. The breaded and fried calamari steak strips were perfectly cooked. They were tender and the portion was perfect for the three of us to share.  We ordered two 16\" pizzas for dinner. The first was the Grandma G's which starts with pesto sauce and adds garlic chicken, carmelized onions, Roma tomatoes, mozzarella, rosemary, and thinly sliced potatoes. The toppings may be odd, but they blend together so well! My oldest son declared \"this is my new favorite pizza!\"  The boys put their heads together and selected the Yahoo Barbecue Chicken Pizza. It was equally as good! We all enjoyed this pizza because the BBQ sauce was amazingly good for an Italian restaurant. I also liked the chicken and red onions, although my youngest picked them off.  I cannot believe this is my 100th Yelp! I'm glad I could share this occasion with both of my sons. Oreganos consistently impresses me. Thank you for making an impression on my sons as well!",

Not a big deal. However, while I was waiting they informed me that they were out of an item I ordered. I have worked in a restaurant before and it is usually customary to call customers and let them know something is out minutes within putting in the order. I was slightly miffed, but she offered to comp the pasta off so I was okay. The last straw was when I finally arrived home and realized they didn't even put the dressing for my salad in the bag, which is annoying because without the dressing I would not eat a salad. If I could rate no stars I would.",

For their \"Midday Rush\" deals, we were able to get a huge slice of cheese pizza for only $2.99! (These slices are a bit larger than a sams club \"slice\" of pizza...the image I attached will give you an idea).  We also got some Italian Gold wings which were okay.... the Garlic Parmesan are wayyyy better and came with a side of chips. Also, their side of fries were waffle style and are delicious and crispy. PS, their salads are HUGE. For $9, you can feed two people right there with just that one dish. My husband really like their Arnold Palmers too, you can tell it's not cheap watered down lemonade.   Lastly, I really appreciated their fresh parmesan that was available for the food. You don't get the fake powdered stuff, you get the REAL cheese!  All in all, I had a wonderful experience here and will be back! I must warn that their Tempe location is a 1 star review (and that's being nice). But THIS ONE had great customer service and left a great impression.",

The girl at the hostess stand even said as much, which I felt was a bit odd as it did not seem overly busy and it was a weekend night at dinner time. We were seated first at a wobbly table with a filthy table cloth, off in what appeared to be a spare room off to the side. When we were moved, we waited and waited during every portion of the ordering and meal process. We were brought food without plates or silverware, and had to wait some more to catch a glimpse of our waitress to go ask for some. Then once we got our food, the waitress had forgotten to order a portion of my sons kids meal, so we waited some more. I was really disappointed and honestly sad as I have always been impressed with Oreganos customer service, but it seemed like everything was chaotic. The tables on both sides of us were apologized to for their food not being ready. I'm not sure if we just hit them on a bad night, or if things have truly slipped. I am hoping we just caught them on a bad night.",

    "text": "One afternoon I was standing in a unnamed field in Las Vegas when I asked Christopher G. a very simple question.  \"What is you favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area?\"  \"Oregano's\" was the immediate response.  I mean it was so matter of fact (like a thunder clap) I stood there stunned.  There was now momentary pause.  There was no eyes drifting up and to the right....It was a very serious statement.  When time would permit..I searched the oracle and found...wait...multiple locations (chain)?!  I would eventually get clarification from Chris G. that the Scottsdale location was ground zero I sought.  The GF and I one day would travel from one desert to another.  The primary destination was one that would afford a base camp for Padre spring training and a place to lay our heads.  A previously laid book mark told use we were not far from Chis G's restaurant conviction.    We plugged the coordinates into the iPhone, which took use to location in question bypassing the Friday traffic.  Sweet!!  We arrived shortly before the witching hour and were quickly seated.  This was around 1700 hours, MST.  I say this because we missed the window for the patio.  Sad, because it was beautiful day, but we were able to find seating inside the restaurant.    With Dean Martin playing in the background, our kick ass waitress arrived and took care of us.  Cheesy garlic bread was ordered and some cocktails.  Bread arrived and was tasty.  I ordered the \"Alfredo The Dark. \"Poblanos, pasta and cream, oh my! First, we take the finest cream and teach it Spanish! Then our Poblano peppers and a special blend of Southwest cheeses are sauteed with a spiral pasta. It's topped with diced Roma tomatoes, a tasty jalapeno and our \"south of the border\" bread. There's nothing to be \"Alfredo\" of.

It was delicious!  Oregano's also offers a cheap AYCE bowel of pasta option.  I relayed this to Christopher G. and sadly he was concerned about the taste of the pasta option rather than the quantity.  I could not say. Maybe franchising has destroyed the mystique of Oreganos.  I don't know.  I will say if you want to see for yourself arrive early and there is ample parking to the rear.",

Consistently outstanding thin crust pizza (why try any other kind?) and in my experience, the  more basic, the better.   Just plain good pizza.    When any number of out-of-town friends visit, it's become a long standing tradition to make it to Oregano's one night of their stay, and everyone has the same feeling; consistently outstanding pizza, consistently good service and the Pazooki cookie dessert is worthy of getting no matter how full you might--split it among as many as eight to ten people.   One quick bite is an absolute treat.   Similar experiences at other Oregano's locations, but the Old Town (area) Scottsdale location remains my \"Go-To\" choice.",

He even offered us soft drinks for the road. When my girlfriend spilled it on the way out (she's so cute), he rushed to grab her another! Food, staff and atmosphere all get a 5s!",

My wife and I started with the simple dinner salad.   It was a very large portion but 99% lettuce.   I will say the home made croutons were awesome but nothing else.   We waited over 5 minutes for dressing that we asked 2 different servers for.   I ordered the chicken lasagna.   No nice way to say it,  it SUCKED.  Very bland and burnt.   Maybe some of the food here is good but this isn't.   My wife ordered a margarita pizza.   Not good either but wouldn't go so far as to say it sucked.  I was very disappointed with this restaurant and will not be back,  ever.   I would say do not waste your money here.  Some reviews seem good so maybe we caught them on the wrong day? ? Or ordered the worst stuff on the menu?   Either way with so many good restaurant's over here I would skip this place.",

Give this place a try especially if you're in the mood for Italian food! You must have dessert don't leave without it! If you're too full to consume it there, no worries, just tell them and  they will be lad to package it up and send it home with you - that's what I did! Delish!!!",

We split a couple of entrees (not pizza) that were both great, too - was just going to look up the menu to remind myself what it was, but the website appears to be down...  Decor was a bit kitschy - but gave you something to do while waiting for food - \"is that a penguin up there?\" kinds of conversations - especially helpful with a kid who's hungry!",

The manager on the floor apologized and gave us the pan without charge. We indulged. Not too much later our deep dished arrived--and we dugged in. Delish! Our wait person was apologetic and checked on us frequently. I believe it was his first day. I'll definitely recommend Oregano's. If I'm in the area again, I'll make sure to stop by. Thank you!",

Every Oreganos I've ever been to has a similar environment, so it's probably part of the brand experience that they're trying to create - but most times my wife and I opt to skip the crowds and just get take-out.  That being said, the food is amazing. Their thin crust pizzas are all super crispy and feature fresh, creative flavor combinations. Try the Grandma G's rosemary chicken potato pizza and the honey gold wings. Leave room for a pizza cookie for dessert!",

We had Riga Tony and Zany Ziti...huge portions and so-so - so delicious. Great waiter, too! We live in Surprise and have one in Glendale but were already headed to Scottsdale for a comedy show. I'm not big on Scottsdale swank and it didn't have that feel at all :)",

The PRIMARY reason it rocks is the staff and how well it's run overall.  Always have had amazing service, even when they are on a wait, they make it nice for you, often bring out free pizza to munch on while waiting.  Not sure if it's the people they hire, the training, the management, or a combo of all of the above but we have never had a bad service or food experience.  They always make you feel welcome and have a sense of service with fun (i.e. they ever-changing fun shirts the staff wears).  Great for families, dates, friends, dining, pretty much everyone is welcome here.    The food is fairly priced, quality ingredients, tasty, and consistent. Italian/Pizzeria focused but with their own take on it.     We love this location, in particular, good parking, great patio, and great staff.",

There were several employees seated at the bar on their day off. Which is fine -- no judgement. However, when you're at your place of work, you need to maintain appropriate conversation and noise levels. These employees were speaking very loudly about highly inappropriate topics relating to race and Disney characters. One of the employees, who was visibly inebriated and quite loud, was saying things about the young lady who was cast as Ariel not having red hair, but it \"wasn't about her being black, because she's not racist, she's marrying a Mexican.\" Truly disgusting and so tasteless. A female manager approached them several times to partake in the conversation, not once telling them to keep it down or change the subject to avoid patrons hearing them. I was completely mortified and very disappointed. Had we been at a bar, I might have felt differently. But Oregano's is a family restaurant, and that kind of language and subject matter is completely unacceptable in a family environment.",

We sat near the bar and David took care of us.  He was such a friendly person and went over and above to tell us about Oregano's and Arizona.  The backstory to Oregano's was really interesting and it was even more so in the way it was told with David's evident enthusiasm and passion for the company.    I had the Zany Ziti and my husband had a pasta dish with sausage, jalapenos and poblanos (I can't remember the name of it).  Both were amazing with ridiculously sized portions.  It's pretty uncommon these days to find a place that doesn't give up quality when going for quantity in their dishes...Oregano's manages to do it!  To wrap up the night, we had the dessert with the chocolate chip cookie and vanilla ice cream... mind blown.  It is a half baked warm cookie that aid complimented amazingly with the cold vanilla ice cream.    If you are visiting Arizona, Oregano's is a must!!",

The Mac and cheese was to die for, the stuffed pizza is as good as it gets west of Chicago, and the salads are enormous.",

We sat on their gorgeous patio and enjoyed two pizzas (a thin crust and a thick Chicago style pizza) stuffed mushrooms and fries. Every single item that touched my tongue was perfect. Delicious food all seasoned to perfection and worth the wait. The wine list was a nice touch too. Nothing worse than a restaurant that gives you a teensy tiny glass of wine - oreganos did not disappoint!!",

It took a long time to order even though there were only 3 other bar guests and 2 bartenders. I had to help myself to a plate and silverware. Good thing they were within reach. No one asked how my food was. No water refill. My cup sat empty next to my plate for 12 minutes. I finally asked someone dropping off a dirty glass for a box. Still no acknowledgment from the bartenders, offer of a dessert or a check. The man across the bar was twirling his credit card and his date finally asked for their check. Another 6 minutes go by. I ask for a check and am ignored. I give up. Threw cash on the bar to cover the food and tax. Next time I'll get takeout.",

Shrooms on steroids, stuffed with sausage and marijuana sauce is the best way to describe them. Spectacular!!!   Just a side note, I went there for lunch a few years ago and had a slice. No good.

We ordered a Big house salad, pesto bruschetta and an order of wings (we like to mix the wings of gold and medium sauces together). We told our server we would like to start with the salad and enjoy the other items as they come out.  After about 20 minutes everything we ordered came out together. We told the food runner to just remove the salad and he apologized. The wings were very small and very dry, hardly any sauce. Our server came back to check on us and we asked for some extra sauce. She brought some sauce that was straight out of the refrigerator. I asked to speak with a manager and he came over and we explained how disappointed we were and he explained that the sauce is always cold and they don't heat it because it will go bad. No other apologies, however he did comp the check.. Based on our experiemces over the years slowly declining, I think our journey with Oregano's is over.",

We decided to give the takeout another chance over this weekend and waited 25 minutes for an order I had placed 6 hours prior. The restaurant is always busy and the young man working the counter is very friendly but we will not be ordering anymore to-go orders from this location.",

    "text": "It's all about the marinara sauce here! It's delicious and well flavored. Started off with the 2 giant meatballs no cheese, hot wings (not that hot but good flavor), bruschetta which had fresh tomatoes and garlic with toasted bread (big portion). My favorite was the garlic roasted chicken lasagna it was worth the calories ( flavor was on point and the lasagna pasta was el dente) we then ordered what we hoped would top our Chicago pizza experience we had, unfortunately it was more cheese than pizza. We ordered the STUFFED PiZZA half PUERTO PENASCO CARNE STREET PIE and half THE OL' MEXIGANO.. had good flavor but way too much cheese, next time we will up the protein and go light on the cheese now we know how they roll. What added the cherry to this review was their staff, super friendly and they have all been there for over a couple of years which tells you about their company culture! Ya for employers who know how to treat their employees. We also tried the dessert pizza which was way over the top but if you combine with ice cream and coffee then it's do able dessert, we only wished they had Italian espresso which would be a fantastic way to end an indulgent meal.",

I love at least one item on every single one of their categories and here they are: Appetizers: -boom dip- the real reason I come to this place! It is so delicious.  -wings: they are huge! And soooo flavorful.   Salads: -Caesar: it might sound simple and super common but this one is delicious. Make sure to get it with chicken - Picasso: what an interesting salad! So good! Salad with a kick!   Entree: -Zin City: HUGE! And delicious! You get this and you get food for three days ;)  Pizza: -Rocky Point: OMG! So delicious! It's like the a taco-pizza and is freaking scrumptious -Numero One-O: Stuffed gorgeousness! I wish I could put in words how good this is, so since I can't, just get it! It's delicious!  Dessert: -Pizza Cookie: oh lord! Also one of the main reasons I visit this place! Its gooey deliciousness, topped with ice cream. You get to choose one or two flavors and it is just the best way to end your meal.  Service is great! People are super friendly and their sayings and theme are hilarious! Definitely stop by if you get the chance!",

For a Monday night there was a 30 min wait for a table as they don't take reservations, a good sign at any restaurant when it's busy on a weekday! As we were waiting we enjoyed very reasonably priced wine from the bar, and they even had little pieces of pizza at the host stand while we waited for our table - cute idea & very delicious.   We had a \"Waiter-in-training\" last night (which is always fun for me, being in the industry I like to give my waiters a hard time & test their skills/knowledge of the menu). He did a great job at keeping the dinner fun (even after initially spilling an entire glass of water on my guests)  The food we ordered was so good... and the entrees were HUGE!  So much food, wine, and a great time at Oregano's- excited to come back soon  Oh yea... and the warm cookie pizza with ice cream was the BEST cap to our dinner  Thanks Oregano's!",

I celebrated a birthday there, and our waiter was truly impeccable - with a party of 7-8 - and my eccentric family, he couldn't have been more accommodating, impeccable with all drink/food orders, and went out of his way to make it SUCH a special evening for me.

Mine never showed up. When the server assisting our main server brought again the wrong item for my husband, she asked if there was anything else we needed. Ah, yay, my food. Clueless, she goes to check. Comes back a few minutes later & starts cleaning the table next to us. Hello, did you find my salad??  She says yes, your server is getting it. Out he comes & starts assisting another table. He finally comes over & admits it was never submitted. He then places my salad order again & attempts to correct my husbands order. 20 minutes later the salad arrives with the correct side order for my husband. He's been done eating for 15 minutes, so what was the point? I get my salad to go because we were short on time.   I ordered a $6.00 glass of wine which took forever to get, but at least I got it. Sure enough, we are charged for everything. Shame on you Oregano's. At least comp the wine, if not the salad I never got to enjoy for lunch. I'll be hard pressed to ever recommend going back. So disappointing. Being in the service industry, this could have been handled so much better than it was.",

    "text": "Well there was this huge huge rainstorm that came - monster storm - I was wondering when it would end - pulled into this other restaurant with Salt in the name - next door - ran in dodging huge puddles and ordered a drink.  Wow - all about college age kids - I could be anyone's mother or grandmother - not where I want to dine.  Okay so I pay and leave and see some action next door at Oregano's...Hmm.... Ok then I see that it's super crowded inside with people hiding from the rain - I ask for a table for one and the hostess suggests I sit at the bar - so I say okay and go into that room - well of course there is not a square inch to breathe - let alone sit or dine.  I come out and tell her ???? why again did you have me go into that room?  She then offers the outdoor patio - which has staff people mopping up the rain with towels and shaking off puddled chairs -- making patrons feel comfortable that another torrent isn't likely in the forecast.  I agree to take one of the dried off tables at the back of the patio - great for viewing all the crowds about to descend and devour.  My waitstaff was superb.  She saw I was a rookie with the menu and explained everything to me very well...the large portions, the signature cocktail, the salads - her favorites - I mean she bent over backward to have me be comfortable in ordering.  I settled on a small calzone and a Bellini drink.  Well the small calzone could feed a family of four easy and the drink was a frozen concoction of some creativity for sure.  The salad was an antipasto that was okay - nothing great.  Truly the menu would take you a couple of months to eat through - it's absolutely enormous.  Like the portions.  The water glasses are huge so you don't have to ask for a refill...I really enjoyed how my server shared the local scoop with me as far as favorite burger places, favorite trendy places etc....  I love it when a foodie talks food - even when at work - serving food.....it's a passion that's so delightful to partake in.  Anyway I think I would definitely try this place again and next try one of their stuffed or deep dish pizza's - I guess you have to wait 45 minutes to get it served but at least they are honest about the wait time up front ... I bet it's good for sure.  Seems a nice place for family or friends for casual party fun - I had a really good time dining there - even alone!",

This is the original location, the best location food wise and also one of the more difficult ones to park at without prior knowledge of the location.  For the past decade I have been meeting m family here for weekday lunches when our schedule permit. The key is to get there either before 11:30 to beat the rush to at 12:30 for when they leave.  Our usual meal starts with the Boom Dip, it is a artichoke dip dish but unlike the now popular clone it is artichoke heavy, lighter on the cream and has a nice browned cheese crust on top. It is now served with strips of pizza crust with cheese on it.  I like to eat the dip straight and put chili oil (yes this is a standard table condiment) red pepper and parmagean cheese on the bread.  For the main course, we split a Large Thin Pesto Pizza. The crust is thin and crispy. In lieu of tomato sauce there is their great pesto sauce, large tomato slices and mozzarella cheese finish up the package.  It is cut into square, with the four corner triangles being the best pieces.  The staff is fun friendly and will to accommodate. The patio has many mechanisms in place to make it bearable on hot dry summer days, inside has high top tables and blast loud swing music.    I also enjoy the penne pesto bake, which is now in a bread bowl, pasta, cheese pesto diced tomato more cheese and a bread bowl. It is worth a try.  The Artichoke lasagna is great if you are willing to wait.   For lunch, the pasta dishes include a salad and for dinner, they do not. I do not get it but that is the way it is.",

On a beautiful evening it's a lot of fun to sit outside with a glass of wine and some good friends and enjoy a meal here. We have friends that come in from Chico every year for the Spring training games and it's kind of a tradition to eat dinner one of the nights at Oregano's. When the toddler was born across the street, my husband walked over that night and got himself some lasagna take-out to come eat with me so now it's also a tradition for us to come here on the toddler's birthday (or thereabouts) to have some dinner and reminisce on that day so that's where we're headed tonight with our brand new three-year-old.   It's probably me, but none of their pastas really do it for me - I just don't like them heavily sauced and their pizzas are what my husband likes - cracker thin or oily and thick. There's just no in between. I enjoy their salads a lot and the garlic bread and can eat an order of bruschetta on my own. My husband is also a big fan of the roasted garlic chicken lasagna and it seems we always order a pizza cookie for dessert, though we might get one on the house tonight being the toddler's birthday and all.   The waiters and waitresses are always friendly and helpful. In fact once I guess our order was taking too long to come out (we hadn't even realized) and the manager came out and apologized and gave us some drinks and dessert for free.   Though obviously not a fancy place at all, it's always proven to be a good place to bring out of town guests. The ambiance, food and service make for a unique experience and won't disappoint.",

Tony is a True Italian from Chicago and obviously has a heart for deep dish with Italian sausage. We had the Portebella stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer this time.  We really enjoy the outdoor seating and the friendly service. When we get around to it, we will try one of their enormous and visually appealling salads. 6 stars! Also the jazzy tunes are a refreshing change of pace.",

I still love oreganos though :)",

Got there less than 10 minutes later to find that there was no wait at all and the patio wasn't even being seated. Hostess was for lack of a better term b*tchy. Spoke with manager who didn't seam to care. (which still doesn't make sense) Bought food and tipped togo person anyway (she was nice but apparently can't do her job and make sure order is right.) Came home to find order was cold and wrong and was charged for extra protein that was not there. Overall annoying experience. Will not be returning to that location. I recommend going to a different one. If they can't get it right on a monday night I am sure it would be even worse if they were actually busy.",

After watching an episode of Sopranos and craving pasta with meatballs, Oreganos was able to satisfy my desires with an endless bowl of pasta and meat sauce for $7 (2 meatballs were an extra $3.29 but they were delicious). I also got a pizza there and they offer various Chicago-style pizzas from thin crust to pan. The pizza does take about half an hour because it's made fresh, but definitely worth the wait. Overall the food was delicious and me and my girlfriend got full and had a ton of pizza leftover, and best part was we only spent 25! The service was average, but everyone was pretty nice there. I would definitely recommend Oreganos to anyone wanting a hearty Italian-style dinner.  Oh, try and go a little earlier (around 5-530ish) to avoid the wait which can be very long on certain days as Oreganos is definitely a hot-spot in Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Went here with my carpool buddy after work last Thursday. We realized that we were driving into the haboob so we decided to pull over and duck into the nearest place we could find. I was in great despair at where we found ourselves since I had just started a new low-carb diet and also wasn't drinking. But I ended up having a great meal anyway.   We sat in the bar since all the tables in the restaurant area were full. But this worked out great since the bar has a big window overlooking Scottsdale Road so we were able to monitor the storm's progress. The place was packed but had a good, lively vibe since all the servers were very friendly and seemed to be having a good time in spite of being at work. I was all set to order one of the sandwiches without bread but the bartender suggested ordering just a side of some meatballs and sauce. This is considered an add-on to the pasta dishes and so it was only $3.99. Such a great deal for a really yummy dinner! My companion got some kind of chicken sandwich and a glass of wine which she really enjoyed. The sand which came with sweet potato fries and she said that she didn't care for them but I managed to stay strong and not sample any so I can't really comment on how good they are. Overall, a pleasurable evening, in spite of the storm and the place being very crowded.   PS: An added perk that made the visit even more enjoyable (well, at least for my friend who is a reality TV junkie) is that one of the servers was Alex from Real World Denver.",

If a place is crowed there is a good reason for it!  The food is good, and people like the ambiance.  They have tons of outside seating which in Arizona is like 8 months out of the year a good choice.  If you don't want to wait 30-60 minutes don't go after 5PM on a Friday or Saturday otherwise what did you expect?  This place gets crowded even for lunch so try and go at odd hours really early before or right at 11AM for lunch, no later than 5:30PM for Dinner.  I take all out of visitors to Oreganos because I love it so.  PS if you try and park in their parking lot you are idiot and you deserve the hassle it causes what do you expect with 4 spots?

Gooey cheesiness on garlicky buttery bread.  I had to stop myself from eating this with the pizza about to arrive.  Aunt Shirley's Gorgonzola Sausage Pan PIzza - an amazing combination of Chicago sausage crumbles, pepperoncinis, and gorgonzola cheese.  The pan crust was awesome.  I normally stay away from pan/Chicago-style crusts because I find them too buttery tasting, like you don't know if you're eating pizza or a dutch apple pie.  Oregano's pan crust was flaky, savory, and a perfect canvas for the toppings.  Service was friendly and on point.  Space inside is a little cramped, but tolerable.  I can't wait to try out Oregano's pasta dishes.",

It's a great place for lunch - as long as you don't have anywhere to be afterward.

The pizzas are fresh and unusual (Grandma G's Rosemary Chicken Potato ... potatoes?  On PIZZA?  Who would have guessed that would be so fantastic?).  The pasta is full of garlic and flavor.  The wings are crispy and perfect.  The sandwiches are huge and tasty.  I could go on.  I've never had anything there that wasn't terrific!  Now, since the food is so good and the atmosphere so fun, and since everyone KNOWS that (due to reviews like the one you're reading now), be prepared to wait.  If you get there around 7:00 any given night, you should be prepared to wait about a half hour.  If you arrive at the same time on a weekend night, your wait could be over an hour.  Parking at the Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale locations is tight (as the Phoenix area tries to grow up and become a real city, this is inevitable, and will be more and more common), but it's better at the Mesa and Gilbert spots.  And since the food is fresh, you naturally have to wait longer for food that takes longer to prepare, such as the wings or the deep dish pizzas.  Okay, you've been warned.  Believe me (and I'm one of Earth's least patient people), the wait will be worth it.",

    "text": "I have been going to Oreganos for such a long time I cannot remember the first time I went.  We got the Lawrences original pizza, the italian gold wings and the PIZZA COOKIE!!!!! YUM!!!!   After that first visit I was hooked!   The problem is that the restaurant is very small...the set up is cool but they need more space...and that is in anyone that I have gone to...the wait is always super long, but that is because the food is awesome!   My suggestions are: The Boom Dip-spinach dip and Bistro Sweet Po's (sweet potato fries) Salads:  Pablo Picasso Mexico Salad and Oreganos Favorite-YUM!! Wings: Italian Gold (be careful if you have acrylic or gel nails it will dye them yellow so be careful) get them with ranch!! Pizzas:  BBQ Chicken, Frisco (my favorite with the tomato cream sauce!!) Lawrence original (I like to add chicken to it) and the El Picasso pizza!  The stuffed pizza is awesome too with pepperoni!!!   Pasta: Pesto Penne Bake (with meatballs or italian sausage) to die for!! The Zany Ziti with the meat added is great!   Dessert:  THE MOST AMAZING DESSERT EVER!!! the PIZZA COOKIE-i love all flavors but the chocolate chip is the best with vanilla ice cream!  You can eat this for a man by itself!   Drinks:  I love their Gibbilini Bellini!   YUM YUM YUM!!!!",

Oregano's in Scottsdale is a fantastic, fun place to get some Italian food in a relaxed atmosphere, maybe while catching a ballgame on the TV.  There's a pizza pie for everyone regardless of your preference - deep dish, thin crust, original, you name it. Do yourself a favor and get the guacamole. Holy Moly! I could have survived on that alone.  The wait stuff are young and fun, and I even did something I never do at a restaurant - I bought a T-shirt. A baseball jersey-style Oregano's shirt that remains one of my favorite tees.  Sidle up to the bar if that's your thing, you'll get great service, conversation, and of course, food. or bring a date and enjoy pizza, lasagna, spaghetti, you name it.  Parking is sparse and the wait may be a little long (get there early for lunch) but it's well worth it.  I just wish there was an Oregano's near me in Michigan.",

I ordered the stuffed rigatony (one of my faves because it comes with a marinara sauce that has small chunks of meat in it).   We ordered it for pick up. They forgot our dressing for our salad (no biggie we had ranch in our fridge). I opened my pasta and it had the wrong sauce on it... it wasn't a red sauce at all, it was cream sauce.   I double-checked the menu description but it still has the same sauce listed as the meat sauce with slight creamy texture. This sauce is definitely a cream sauce and an occasional tomato. Just not sure if there's a new recipe and the menu hasn't been updated, or it was just a genuine mistake in the kitchen.  The chicken parm sandwich my boyfriend had was great though, so we just shared that instead! :)",

Oregano's has a comfortable and entertaining ambience with classic jazzy music that entertains all ears and makes you want to dance. The menu can please just about anyone, and the prices are very reasonable for the portions offered. It's a wonderful place to bring a date or the fam.   I order pick up from here frequently when I have a craving for pizza and pasta, so I knew exactly what I wanted when I placed my order last night; pepperoni pan pizza (Pan is the best btw), meatballs (oh my gosh amazing ), brussel sprouts, pesto pasta, and the caesar salad (I suggest the kale version with raisins, it's unlike any other). Anyway, the order was ready when I got there but it was not correct. This has never happened before and I didn't have time to wait around for it to be remade, so I had to settle for what we had and left disappointed. Despite this glitch the food we got was still good and the manager was incredibly apologetic and made things right. He could not have been more accommodating and absolutely restored my faith in Oregano's for not only their food but also their service. I can't say enough about how well he handled the situation and wish more managers did the same.   This is a hip and happening Italian joint that is a great place to go enjoy a meal in or order pick up from. I'll be back time and time again to fulfill my Italian food cravings!",

Square 2 - calamari. I'm pretty sure these squids swam right out of the Atlantic into a deep frying pan of heaven doused with a twist of lemon and homemade marinara.   The final course - you have to have the big rig, a light pink panther sauce with a chipotle kick, You would have thought Ronaldo himself served up.

Which is fine, but if you don't accept reservations and have a 40 minute wait time on a Tuesday evening you should probably provide some sort of seating for waiting guests. We were told to go wait at the bar. Which is a nice idea in theory. If you hadn't already filled the bar. There was standing room only to wait, and if I hadn't been there at the request of my sister I would have left rather than have to stand packed against other guests and in the way of servers. It was all in all a claustrophobic and uncomfortable experience.   Once we were finally seated my mood improved. Our server went above and beyond and almost helped me forget the fire hazard I had just escaped from. The pizza was tasty, I have lived in Chicago and their \"stuffed crust\" or Chicago deep dish did not disappoint.",

The host was super nice and he said it would take the same amount of time for the food to cook so if we were going to wait either way, may as well take a seat. All of this with a smile on his face.

Our server was super friendly, informative, and sincerely conscientious.  The decor and ambiance is heavy but it fits the feeling of the eatery.  The food and drinks started out blah but ended well.  We first ordered cocktails and appetizers.  My \"vintage martini\" wasn't very good...something wasn't quite right.  I would also rate the calamari as less than average as well.  Everything else was superb.  The brussell sprouts were very good.  Now to the pizza.  We tried to order a 12 inch Chicago style pizza to share and our server strongly recommended that we reduce it to a 10\".  We followed his recommendation and were glad we did.  This pizza was just AMAZING.  I took down 2.5 pieces and thought I was going to bust.  We left 2 pieces on the pan when we left.  The worst part was we didn't have room for the cookie...which is the reason my friend told me to go Oregano's in the first place.  I guess I'll just have to go back...",

The slices are HUGE, especially the lunch special, which by the way is only 2.99.  The greek favorite salad is a nice addition to the slice pizza.  It has a little bit of sweetness and pine nuts in the salad gives it a nice crunch.    Server Brian was surburb!!  Spent a good 10 minute walking us through the choices.

Facilities were fine, place was clean, plenty of seating option, staff knew what they were doing.  Price was reasonable, about $22 for the two of us.  No complaints at all.  Several locals have told me this is their favorite pizza place and their only complaint is that sometimes it gets super busy - so there can be a wait.    Bottom line - Rock solid good pizza.

Luckily, it's almost never as long of wait as they say, and you can always relax and enjoy a beer or cocktail while you wait.  Our last visit was a party of 4, and we only waited long enough to have a single round before being seated (which is not long!).  Oreganos is just a fantastic overall value, and I've always had great service and food.  They've done whatever it takes to achieve the magic formula of restaurant success, and maintained this over a number of years.    Parking can be a bit interesting for this location, and if you don't want to wait I recommend arriving outside the 5 - 8pm dinner rush.  The only other advice I have is the cookie Pizza is worth saving some room for!",

    "text": "Let  me preface this review with \"I wanted Oregano's to be better\". However. Its common knowledge that there are excessive waits here at Oregano's and I assumed that is due to the high quality pizza coming from the kitchen. Well, unless you have a few hours to burn you are not going to find out. I sat at the bar as I arrived solo and the bartender was friendly and quick. As I looked at the menu and asked for suggestions she alerted me that most items were about an hour wait or sometimes 45 minutes. That being said the only thing you can get in under 30 minutes is their famous \"pizza on a cracker\" dish. They suggest ordering your food while you sit outside waiting for you table. \"That's how the regulars do it\". Apparently this is due to the great pizza shortage in Arizona. Its not cheap and there is nothing I can see that makes it unique other than they expect you to wait an hour for a 10\" pizza.  They augment their hard to read menu by NOT offering Calzone or Stromboli. And as an added plus there is not a TV in the joint with any sports whatsoever. (All the TV's show some type of 1940's movie reel)  This was a Sunday night during the NFL season when the World Series was also being played but I enjoyed the black and white silent movie instead........ How nostalgic! Well that is if nostalgic means sucks.   And if that was not enough 6 minutes after I ordered a simple pepperoni biscuit I asked about appetizers realizing I would not see the biscuit for 28 minutes. I ordered BOOM chips and BOOM they never arrived. I promptly cancelled the boom when the pizza arrived. Less boom more pffftt.  Oregano's reminds me of Bucco de Beppo but for pizza......And without the positives that Bucco has, whatever those are???  With all this nonsense I just found myself wanting to bail quickly and even left 3/4 of a beer behind. (Amazing) But the manager did inquire why I did not want to take the remainder of the grease biscuit with me and seemed genuinely concerned. The bartender was also very nice.  The kitchen and time to plate are the Achilles heel.   Please don't tell me this is the best Arizona can do for pizza. Lord there has got to be a Grimaldi's or Bambini's around here somewhere.",

The ziti was excellent and that is the reason I gave this place 2 stars.  The pizza was definitely not what I was expecting.  The entire pizza was stuffed with cheese and a few pepperonis, it wasn't just the crust.  The crust was more of a deep dish style crust and was too crunchy and hard for my liking.  I will most likely stick with the thin crust as the reviews on it are way better.",

    "text": "I tried not to like Oregano's that much. It's always so crowded, I thought if I could just make myself not like it then that would be one less crowd to fight through, one less line to wait in, one less cramped bar to stand at shouting drink orders.   To no avail.   My ladyfriend and I went in this Saturday and it was slammed, predictably. I was starving and they told us the wait was an hour but we knew we might be able to yoink a couple seats at the bar and order from there. And we did: we patiently and methodically stalked some poor geriatric couple and pounced on their seats like velociraptors the second they pushed them back.   We got a pair of diet sodas and ordered a salad, which came out quickly, especially considering the crowd. We ordered an excessive amount of pesto pizza because I was ready to gnaw my hand off from hunger and it also came out pretty fast.   We didn't need the pizzookie (or Pizza Cookie, as non-BJ's aficionados would call it), but we succumbed to temptation and above average saleswomanship and ordered one. We washed it down with a beer and a glass of wine for the lady and were finished within 45 minutes of sitting down, and the bill was barely thirty dollars.   For a meal like that I was amazed. And bordering on paralysis due to excessive food intake (I dabble in competitive eating, but obviously was unprepared on this occasion).",

    "text": "Can you say Mama Celeste?  This restaurant was so unbelieveably bad I had to whip out my notepad and take notes.  To have the word Chicago anywhere near this menu is downright criminal.  Aside from the frozen grocery store pizza-like cheese (a sprinkle here and there), it had enough salt to melt a Chicago winter's thickest ice covered street in seconds.  I went here today, Sept 3rd for a late lunch.  Alright so I'm on vacation in Scottsdale to scout locations for my future home.  I've spent the past 37 years of my life in Chicago eating pizza (thin crust and stuffed) on a weekly basis.  I read about this place all over and so many people (including some deluded dude at the table next to me) kept raving about how \"Chicago\" this pizza is.  Oh my goodness!!!!!!!!!  If this is Chicago pizza, kill me now!  this was the worst pizza ever!  I should have known when the waiter guy (a chick appeared later) said in response to our stuffed cheese pizza order, \"I don't recommend cheese only\".  He said, \"if you get cheese only its gets pockets that don't cook all the way and explode when you cut it\".  Huh?!  He was going on about this detriment when I finally cut him off and explained that I was from Chicago, wanted to compare stuffed pizzas, never heard of this but was scared so I'll go with the thin crust.  My boyfriend looked puzzled but I flat out told him, \"Obviously they don't know what they're doing\".  Don't cook all the way?  Explode when you cut into it?  What?!  I appreciate his warning but wonder if he was just trying to up sell since more ingredients equals more $.  If that was the case, his strategy backfired as I went for the thin crust which was cheaper altogether.  As it turns out, I must thank him as Oregano's is a restaurant I wouldn't recommend to my worst enemy.  Bad, bad, bad pizza.  It was actually embarrassing!  As I stated earlier, I overheard a neighbor table mentioning how \"Chicago\" this pizza was.  He wasn't from Chicago but had been there and had pizza from there and thought this Oregano's pizza was so good. Embarrassing!  I wanted to set him straight so badly but I didn't.  If this is what Arizonians (is that a word?) think Chicago pizza tastes like, I must find a home asap and open a REAL Chicago pizza restaurant.  I'm so embarrassed!  Seriously embarrassed!",

There is always a wait because every location is built small, it upsets my stomach almost every time, the pizza is to thin to fill me up, and although the pazookie is great I can make it at home and not wait forever. This location in particular is always packed so unless you come at an odd time prepare to wait. Also if you want deep dish pizza, and not the cracker thin default, you have to wait an additional half and hour at least. The food is OK but not worth the wait in my book!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went to Oregano's in Old Town , Scottsdale on Tuesday at around 4:30. We were told there would be a 5 to 10 minute wait. We walked in and there were several tables that were available in the bar area. The waiter told us we need the hostess to sit us in the bar area. So in about 10 minutes she finally seated us at the table we were sitting at anyway. Then our waiter finally came back stating his was not our waiter but will be taking our drink order, we just ordered water. We order a salad we were thinking of splitting the large and ask the waiter, he stated that the salad was large enough to feed all three of us  which included him.  He then staed we should just orde two small dinner salads which would have been around 6. 50 so we opted for the large sald for 5.99. It was good and fresh and the Chipolte dressing was good and spicy. The pizza took over 45 mins thin crust we ordered half Lawrence and half Numero Ono it came out Luke warm, the crust was paper thin and burnt black on the edges and skimpy toppings. My boyfriend said his side had good flavor, but I could not taste much of anything, the fresh Parmesan was a good touch. When we inquired about the pizza crust being burnt the waitress stated that it was our fault for ordering 2 different sides on the pizza, never had a problem like this at other places Grazies, or Grimaldi 's. We thought that she was rude and full of herself, we also noticed that the music was so loud we had a hard time hearing ourselves. Oregano's use to be my favorite place , but the last few times I have been there food , service is not very good, I think oregano's need to focus on good customer service and food quality control. I doubt we will be back, Grazies is still number one on our list, great food and service.",

We started off with some toasted ravioli with marinara sauce. It had a little kick to it and was tasty, but nothing out of the ordinary. Then we moved on to the Italian wedding soup and antipasta salad. The soup was delicious and came with a small piece of yummy cheese bread. The salad was extraordinarily good with a ton of cured meats and artichokes. My father in law who is not a salad fan, loved it too!  Their buffalo wings are big and juicy, but not dripping with sauce (just the way I like it). We ordered the medium spice which had a nice and tang with a little heat that creeps up on us after we devoured our first piece.  We then had their midnight pasta and substituted fettuccine in place of their corkscrew pasta and chose shrimp as our protein. The dish came with a ton of delicious gigantic pieces of shrimp and the portion of the pasta could easily feed 4 people with all the salad and apps we got. Their thin crust pizza was delicious and crispy even in the center.  Needless to say, we had left overs and had no room for dessert. I will definitely be back here on our next trip to Scottsdale.",

I think the common consensus among most everyone is that Oregano's is fabulous. It's fun, the food is really good and the servers are always friendly and fast. The pizza cookie is pretty much famous and for those who haven't been recently, peanut butter is now one of the options- and it's delish. I usually split a pizza when I come and it's always good, but the big rig pasta is really tasty too.  Just make sure you have two to three hours to spend at dinner, because Oregano's will never be an in and out joint.  There is almost always a long wait, no matter what day or time it is and the food just takes awhile to cook. But don't worry, it's always worth it.",

I have to say that I've lived in Europe half my life, had some of the best desserts known to man probably but the pizookie at Oregano's is easily in my top 3. It's one of those desserts that actually gets better and better as you eat it. The half baked cookie and ice cream blend together wonderfully for a culinary delight. I'd recommend just going there for dessert after eating somewhere else or after a movie for example. The only downside and I consider it a somewhat important factor is that the wait can usually be 30-45 minutes. Pizza portions are great though pizza here isn't among my favorites. Definitely recommended for anyone living in the Phoenix area and wants to dine outdoors or who is in the Old Town Scottsdale are if they don't mind waiting. Parking isn't too bad of a deal as you can generally park along some of the galleries just a street away from busy Scottsdale Rd.",

    "text": "Horrible, horrible service, all I can say.  I went there yesterday for the first time.  Some overly confident little guy with blond spikey hair was in charge of taking reservations.   He said it was an hour wait -or- we could go sit anywhere in the bar where it is first come first serve open seating.  So we go and sit at the bar, get menus, are about to order.  Then a table opens up in the bar room.  We leave our seats at the bar, go to the table, and some other people take or seats at the bar.  A few minutes later spikey haired little guy comes over and says why are you sitting here?  I was taken by surprise and said you told us it was open seating.  He cut me off, raised his voice, told me I was a liar, then asked if my friends and I Iike to eat at dirty tables (they had not yet been cleared).  I said of course not, tried to explain, and he left in a huff after making a scene.  We were planning at that point on finishing our drinks, leaving the table, then just waiting the hour for a table.  Then, a waitress comes over two minutes later, looks at us, and says loud and as rude as she could:  are you going to get up or what?  I have NEVER been treated so rudely ANYWHERE.  We just left.  Who cares about the food, the servers/ spikey haired hostess are rude, will never go again.",

    "text": "With a couple Germans in tow, the boyfriend and I headed over to a late dinner at Oregano's.  It was a Thursday at about 9pm and we were seated immediately.  The hostess was friendly and our server was prompt with taking drink orders.  The high four tops in the dining room are way too small for four people and while I know they are trying to cram as much seating in there as possible, there really shouldn't be more than two people at those tiny tables.    We ordered drinks and appetizers. I like that they serve Four Peaks beer on tap.  I always appreciate when a restaurant uses local products.   The Italian fries were decent, the calamari....not so much.  I thought it was quite rubbery and too thickly cut.    For an entree, I ordered the Southwestern Shrimp Caesar salad. This is my favorite item at Oregano's.  I know, I know it's a pizza place, but I really love this salad.  The shrimp are always cooked well and they take the tails off which makes it much easier to eat.  I love the cilantro mixed with the salad.  The salad this night didn't disappoint.  The boyfriend ordered a pasta dish with gorgonzola stuffed sausages, which he didn't even touch because he was so full from the appetizers.  But it looked great.  The Germans ordered a pan pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers.  The pizza looked great and between the two of them they happily polished it off.  Our server was attentive throughout the meal and was patient during the translation process when we ordered.  Oregano's is a place I've been to many times.  My only complaints are table size and the wait that you normally have.  I like the food but they are getting to be a bit chain-ish for me.  For pizza I'd still rather go to Grazie or Grimaldi's, but when some want pizza and some want pasta Oregano's is a decent alternative.",

I am not a huge pizza fan just bc i think there is only so many ways you can make it with it  still being considered pizza. Oreganos has some original concepts but nothing that really jumps out at me.  if i had to choose a place to eat this would be one of them but not close to the top of the list.  FUN, Easy, and if your lucky it can be quick.  Try it out. Pasta Salads are one of the best things on the menu",

We were really looking forward to this based on Yelp reviews, but were all disappointed.   The tomato sauce had a very strong sage/thyme/oregano flavor that overrode the meager toppings.  The cheese was definitively not Italian - cheddar/mozzarella mix with very little flavor.  We also ordered the \"Favorite Oregano Salad\" which was another disappointment as  the raisins overwhelmed the subtleness of the feta and kalamata  olives.   We will not be back.  Can someone please tell me where to get a good Italian pizza in Scottsdale?",

The server told me the wait was 1 hour and 45 minutes.  Are you kidding?    Then they had me sit at the bar table.  The waiter then kicked me out of the table.  Apparently, those tables were reserved.  He instructed me to sit at an empty bar stool.  It seems they were also reserved.  Rather than saying so, an angry mother PUSHED me out of the way.  Is that necessary?  A simple statement that there was a miscommunication would have sufficed.    I really resent being kicked out of the table and being pushed.  The hostess had no other alternative than to drink in another section.  Would I really want to spend any money in this establishment after such an experience?  I will never go back to any Oregano's.     A much better option in Old Town is the Daily Dose, just one block away.  The servers are very nice, the food is tasty, there was no wait and there were GREAT happy hour specials.  Check out the Daily Dose.  It saved my evening.",

They have a small indoor area (like 4-5 tables) and a bigger outdoor area in the back. Prices were reasonable for this kind of food and ambiance; we paid $22 for the appetizer and pizza for two, no drinks (just can't justify spending $2+ on a drink that costs me less than that to buy at the grocery store, lol). We didn't have that gross-too-full-feeling afterwards which was nice since we walked around afterwards. A must eat at place!",

We recognize some of the servers, and they know who we are. We also come with his mother and little sister for family dinners and are never disappointed.   The ONLY poor experience we have had there was the last time we went in. We, just he and I, ordered the Big Beefsro Salad to share. In terms of size, we were not disappointed, the salad was HUGE. But we did not like the flavors at all. We each maybe had 4 or 5 bites, which barely touched the salad, and had to order something else. Our waitress asked if we liked it and we informed her we couldn't eat it. She commented on how little of it we ate, that it barely looked touched and took it away. We ordered our normal pizza, and ate that just fine. When we received the bill the salad was on it, so I asked our server if there was any way we could remove it, or at least discount it, since we didn't even eat it. She looked at us and walked away to the bar filled someone Else's drink and came back to check if we were ready to pay.  In the end we paid for it, and left, still tipped her well, even if she wasn't willing to help us.   Other than that one experience though, every time we go in we are treated very well. It's always busy at dinner time, so come early! I highly recommend the Boom Dip, Toasted Ravioli Espanol, Bistro Sweet Po's, Thin Crust Pizza with sausage and pepperoni, the Chicago Stuffed Pizza with pepperoni (order this one To-Go, at the beginning of your meal as it takes 40-45 minutes to make and enjoy pizza all week at home!), and of course the Original Pizza Cookie (my favorite is the Peanut Butter!)!",

It's a good excuse to get out of town.***   If it's a loooong wait, and you don't mind a little ambient noise go ahead and sit in the bar. You can usually sashay right in, grab a spot and be happily full in a fraction of the time it would take to get through the full restaurant experience.  However, if you have the time the patio is worth waiting for, and the little house full of tables is cozily warm and full of divine smells.   I recommend trying the big ol' ravioli with the Big Rig sauce (a variation on the menu version). It comes with a slice of garlic bread as big as your head and you'll probably be able to eat leftovers for breakfast!  ***The big ol' ravioli has been REMOVED FROM THE OREGANO'S MENU - which means if you love stuffed cheesy pasta Oregano's is no longer the place for you(us)!***",

As we pulled up into the lot right before they were closing we ordered 2 of these and quickly, illegally parked to devour our dessert. Imagine warm succulent cookie dough, crispy crust on the outside, warm gooey in the middle, and just cold ice cream floating on top. Orgasmic Heaven!! when is this coming to California?!?! Oh, the staff is warm and friendly and treats you like family even when they are about to close. Go!",

    "text": "During a recent visit to the Old Scottsdale area I was hit with my usual pizza craving. This is always a good thing, one of my favorite pizza joints, Gimaldi's, is located just down the street from my hotel. Only this time I decided to give someone else's pizza a shot. I had seen Oregano's a number of times but had never stopped in. That was until now; I made a left instead of a right and hit Oregano's. It was a bit chilly but chose to sit outside since there were patio heaters. The outdoor seating area was quite nice, but a little close to the road making it a bit noisy.   Looking at the menu I saw Oregano's offered numerous dishes, they all look very tasty. They also offer thick crust Chicago style pizza, in addition thin crust is also offered.  That's good because I'm a thin crust guy. Since this was my first visit I ordered thin crust cheese, in my view the basic cheese pizza is the True test for any pizzeria. After a short wait my pizza arrived. It looked very good, very thin crust but over dressed with cheese. Interestingly while it was the traditional round pie, it was cut into squares verse the usual wedges. However the real test is how it tastes. It was very good, better than most pizzerias. That said it wasn't perfect. It was over dressed with cheese, which in turn made it just a bit greasy. Still make no mistake, this is very good pizza, maybe even bordering on excellent. Yet there is on huge problem. Oregano's is located only about a mile from Gimaldi's. In my view Gimaldi's doesn't serve very good or even excellent pizza, they serve extraordinary pizza. Prices are virtually identical. For me it's a no brainer if in the area, its Gimaldi's for pizza. Maybe the only way I would choose Oregano's over Gimaldi's would be if I wanted something other than pizza. Oregano's also seems a bit more on the casual fun side.  At Oregano's you'll find a very good pie, just keep in mind if pizza is what you crave it isn't the best. The best lies only lies about a mile away.",

    "text": "I heard really good things about Oregano's ever since I moved to Scottsdale a year ago. So when I finally decided to go there for lunch on a Sunday with my boyfriend to celebrate our 6 months, I was extremely disappointed.  We were immediately sat, being one of maybe a dozen patrons in the restaurant. Our server came to the table right after we sat and asked us what he could get for us. We both asked for water and my boyfriend ordered a Sam Adams seasonal. When the server returned with our drinks he asked us if we were ready to order. Since we had not been there before we took a while to decide on food. So the server gave us more time to decide. While he was gone we both sipped the beer and it was flat and undrinkable. The server came back moments later and started talking to us about the menu and making recommendations. We finally settled on the Margherita pizza and after we put in our order our server was no where to be found. We sat there 40 minutes watching others come in and order their food. We still did not get our pizza and could not find our server so we finally just got up and left. A host said goodbye to us on the way out but did not ask us how our meal was. My boyfriend and I both work in a restaurant so we understand slow ticket times when a restaurant is busy, but being one of only a few tables there was just unacceptable. We went to California Pizza Kitchen and had a much better experience and actually got our food. I was very disappointed in our experience and will never return to any Oregano's location.",

The bartenders are nice, and friendly. The drinks however are average to poor. They dont have a big selection, and SKY is the best vodka they have. Nowhere else is that topshelf. Ordered the calamari recommended by a bartender and dipped it in the buffalo wing sauce as suggested. The calamari was just frozen stuff and nothing special. I left after a couple average vodka tonics and went to another nearby place. I came back a second night and tried the pizza. The thin crust looked great, but when I ordered it the guy said it would take at least an hour cause thye have a small oven. SO, I switched to a pan. It was good, but not great. Would not go back I dont think.",

There was a time when 2+ hour waits were common on Fri & Sat nights & I was stopping in 3X a week. But after our experience today for lunch I would be shocked if anyone would wait at all. Our server Pedro was ok. I think he touched the table 6X. He didn't go above or beyond so he would be a 3 star. The kitchen however, was S L O W. No excuses for a Friday afternoon. My friend S had the Pablo Picasso Mexico salad, Big $7.89. Should have had a good half handful of seasoned shredded chicken on it. Not so much. I would say it was worth the price though. My buddy S had the Big Meatball sandwich. $9.29. He said it was very good. Meatballs were moist & flavorful. He's a big time valley food blogger, food judge & all around good guy. I trust his palate. I would like to say that I remember the days when this sandwich came with 4 meatballs. Now it comes with 3. (Insert unhappy imoticon here) I ordered the Bunch O Chicken. $4.99. It's suppossed to be 1/2 lb of their sauteed & seasoned chicken. Not so sure there's was 8 oz of chicken in the dish but since I left my scale at home I'll give them the benefit of doubt. I also ordered the Brussels Sprouts. $4.89. The menu says \"roasted the Italian way\". I'm pretty sure most Italians would never lay claim to this dish (see picture). I love roasted brussel sprouts & these were just wrong. Not a difficult dish to execute by any means so I'm amazed they did such a poor job and even more amazed that the kitchen mgr ALLOWED it to be sent out. Tsk tsk. Because of this, 2 stars.",

Lots of sauce that lacked flavor and crust was pretty average.   Fun theme but we all felt it was a bit overdone.    You'll feel like your at a Disney park.  If your looking for Average Italian meal, huge portion at great prices it's a perfect choice.   Small kids would love it!",

    "text": "I had only discovered this Arizona pizza chain restaurant recently despite having lived in Arizona for a while. The garlic bread here that I tried is actually quite good especially with the marinara sauce which they make in house. However, the Chicago thin crust pizza was slightly disappointing. In the end I still prefer the NY thin crust style pizza but that may just be a personal preference than anything else. While the male bartender was extremely nice and easy going I don't think Oregano's is worth the hype to me. I'm also aware that they do serve deep dish pizza but there is a long wait time for that.  With so many pizza restaurants in Scottsdale it's unsure as to whether or not I'll come back here.",

Still worth eating the food is amazing and will continue to go there. I will say the food and the customer service is worth the wait.",

It doesn't matter what city you're in, when you walk into an Oregano's you feel comfortable.    The music and the old movies playing on the TV's makes you feel like you're in a different era.  Eating huge portions of delicious pasta or pizza while sipping on a Dirty Monkey (one of the best mixed drinks ever) and enjoying great company make this place a go to regular spot.  The service staff at any location never fails to disappoint and you can be sure you're probably going to be walking out with a to go box or 3.

We used to get our parents to take us to the Tempe location so us college kids could get a good meal and take some leftovers back to our dorm room. The pizza is bomb. I like the thin crust and the oddly shaped slices. My go to toppings are always sausage and onion. The salads and pastas are large! The Big Rig is my favorite pasta; it has a creamy chipotle red sauce that is unlike any other pasta sauce I have tried.  But...I have a new favorite item on the menu...the wings! With the Italian Gold sauce! I had no idea what Italian Gold sauce was when another guest insisted that we order it. I was just going to order medium buffalo sauce (how boring!). I'm so glad I tried the Italian Gold; it's amazing! It's great with both the bone in and boneless wings! These really are the best wings in Phoenix!",

Their food is consistently good and they pretty much always get out order right.  I love their Heckuva Slice.  It's so cheap and you get two slices that are a little bit smaller than new york style!  It's a great deal.  The Alfredo the Dark is also one of my favorite dishes and I always get it with a delicious sausage link.  Other things I recommend are their sides of chicken and brussels sprouts- both delicious.          My coworker said she has gotten the tree hugger skillet and that it was really yummy as well.  I'm going to try that next time.  The portion sizes are always more than enough and again, quality is consistent.  Today I ordered from this location on my own dime.  I got my usual- Alfredo the Dark with no tomatoes.  They accidentally put tomatoes on my order and they made it right by comping me my order.  I just had to pay for my Heckuva Slice.  This shows me that they care about their customers and want us to keep coming back.  I really appreciate this type of service and dedication.  Thank you guys and keep up the good work!",

    "text": "I was just thinking about the evolution of the pizza place as a hangout.  When you are a kid, you can't wait to go to Chuck E. Cheese for some peperoni pizza and some fun-tivities.  When you get older, you go to a local chain pizza place for a cheap dinner with friends or a cheap date.  When you start making money, you opt for some organic, gluten-free, fair-trade, new-age pizza joint where a 12'' pie will cost you $60.  Oregano's falls somewhere in between #2 and #3.  The place itself is tiny, so get ready to wait.  And wait.  And wait a little more.  I am not certain whether you can make reservations over the phone, but I know that you can stop by and tell the host you want a table for six at 8 pm.  That's what we did.  If the weather is nice, you can sit outside in the back section of the Oregano's parking lot.  They rope off a few parking spots, put up some giant umbrellas for shade and ambiance, bring out the best washable red-and-white checkered tablecloths and . . . voila!  You've got yourself an outdoor seating area.   While you're waiting for the pizza, why not order their signature drink, the Bellini.  It is not the traditional Italian Bellini, which, I believe, is made with white peach puree and Prosecco.  The Oregano's Bellini could be best described as a slushee with cheap alcohol.  The flavors are unrecognizable, but somehow it works.  It's the kind of a drink that is much more likely to give you a brain freeze and a sugar rush instead of a buzz or a hangover.  We had to wait for our Bellini for a good 20 minutes because the slushee machine was on the fritz.  For the six of us, we ordered two extra large (18'') thin crust pizzas, a BBQ Chicken and a Hawaiian pizza.   The pizzas arrived promptly on gigantic aluminum trays . . . just like pizzas should be served in a place like Oregano's.  The pizzas were cut up into small squares, making it ideal for sharing.  Also, eating 20 little squares of pizza eliminates the guilt associated with eating several slices of pizza.  That's a huge bonus.  The pizza itself wasn't the best I've ever had, but it wasn't the worst, either.  The crust was crunchy and delicious.  The toppings were just OK, and I was not impressed with the feta/mozzarella cheese combo that topped the BBQ chicken pizza.  A couple of my friends complained that the Hawaiian pizza toppings tasted moldy, but I didn't think so at all.  Of course, I think that pineapples belong in a fruit cocktail, not next to Canadian bacon.    Our waiter looked like a struggling college student who worked at Oregano's part time.  He was nice with just a slight hint of ambivalence.  He tried to make jokes, almost trying to \"fit in\" with our group.  It was cute in a way, although I did sense a slight hint of desperation and trying-too-hard-ness.  Overall, it's a good place to spend time with your friends and relive your high school years, when hanging out at your local pizza parlor was cool.  We left Oregano's very full, even though we left a few little pizza squares on the table.  When I got back to the hotel, I got the urge to get started on my Algebra homework . . .",

I Like their pizza for what it is.....very thin and kinda bite size, cut into squares.  Their house salad is good, Love the Raspberry Vinaigrette. LOVE the Italian Gold Wings and They Absolutely have The BEST Pizookie around. Others places may try to imitate but should just really give it up* *cough** B.J.s**cough**   I wish it had more room. I wish it had more parking. I hate the wait.  I'm giving 3 stars based on the Pizookie, everything else is just mediocre especially if you have to deal with the wait/parking issue.  It's definitely worth checking out if you have never been.  I loved that one day I stopped by with my dog and even though they don't allow dogs on their patio they did let me bring her if I agreed to keep her in her kennel, Fine by me cause I was not about to leave her in the car!!",

They do have a few pasta dishes that I enjoy and they do taste good but not good enough to outweigh the cons of this restaurant. I can deal with a long wait if the food tastes great and the atmosphere is nice. While the food does pass...the atmosphere just ugh...  It's SO crowded. There's like four tables inside. However they have ample OUTSIDE seating. Um...  Do they not realize this is Arizona? There are only about two months out of the year where outside seating is a comfortable choice. Also, the parking is horrible. You're lucky to get a spot in their tiny lot.  Since they're always so crowded the service is really slow too. It sucks because their food is pretty tasty. Oh well.",

First off, the service has always been extremely friendly and welcoming.  The North Scottsdale location has great customer service.  On one visit after waiting 45 minutes for a deep dish we were told it was wrong, and we were given the half that was correct, a new pizza, a drink for each of us, and the offer of dessert.   A second time, again after waiting 45 minutes, our pizza was dropped and we got a drink and our pizza for free.    We are in love with the thin crust, deep dish, and cheesy bread.  Can't say much for any thing else on the menu - we don't order it!  Definitely get a bellini if you're up for a drink - yummy!!  And a pizookie!!  Yes, the wait is around 45 minutes every day of the week, but most of the time they will let you put in a deep dish pizza order while you are waiting.   Love it!",

Whether you have the thin crust or the stuffed, you're eating some of the best pizza in the valley. I've dined at several of their locations, and can't say enough about how good it is.   And save room for desert. The Pizookie is fantastic. I highly recommend the peanut butter chocolate chip.   There is one negative.  If you decide to have something other than the pizza, be warned. The sandwich and pasta portions are huge, and make for lousy leftovers. They never seem to reheat well.",

    "text": "This is probably the worst Oreganos location for parking.  Back in the 1990's they just had the one small building with a handful of spots, and everyone else was forced onto find a spot outside on one of the busiest streets in Scottsdale (Scottsdale Rd.).  The place always had long lines and a long waitlist, and even a decade ago they knew it was a problem.  To remedy the problem, they added on a small shack sized structure that is adjacent to the original building.  Great!  It's as if they didn't get the memo, and decided to add on something provided little relief to the problem they already have.  The atmosphere with painted wall murals is probably one of the better locations in Arizona, because the limited parking area is painted as well.  Wait times are on par with the other locations.  Decorative menu is the same (Oreganos is an Arizona chain restaurant).  Food quality is the same as the other locations, and bears little resemblance to authentic Chicago pizza and Italian fare.  Service is inconsistent, and usually poor.  This place is a snowbird trap, so you're better off to avoid it in the winter months.",

I came here for Lunch during the week and as always there was a slight wait. The wait wasn't that long, but as you wait they offer you free samples of pizza. As you walk through the Restaurant, pretty much every employee greets you. It doesn't seem cheezy either. It made my feel happy to  be greeted so nicely. Needless to say, the staff was fantastic and service was prompt and efficient. If you order a fountain type beverage, you get what looks like a 32 oz cup. I seriously needed two hands to drink from it and never needed a refill. For eats, we ordered the large dinner Salad and the BBQ Chicken Pizza on Whole Wheat Thin Crust. The Salad- pretty basic but adequate. The Pizza- Was disappointed in the whole wheat crust. I know it's hard to get right and they haven't got there quite yet.  The crust was too crispy and sometimes burnt in places. Besides that, the Pizza was still enjoyable. It had the right portions of everything.  Look forward to returning again.",

Get the golden italian, you will not be disappointed.  Many items on the menu have their unique Oregano's spin and combine flavors and foods you wouldn't find at your average pizza place.  For instance the GuacaToni; guacamole with oregano for an italian flair.  Not to fret, Oregano's has all the standards too if you're looking for a typical pepperoni pie.  They have gluten friendly crust, and many things are vegetarian and can be made vegan.  They do not yet have a dairy-free cheese, but I'm hopeful this might be something they add in the near future.",

I ordered a small house salad and a small \"Numero One-O\" pizza as take out.   Both the guy who took my order on the phone and fulfilled it, and the hostess were very warm and friendly! From that small experience, the staff is 5/5. From the brief time I was in the restaurant, the interior looked nice and inviting. My only ding in the service department was that it took 30 minutes for my order, about twice as long as most other pizza places.   The food here was pretty good. The salad was unremarkable but the house Italian dressing is tasty! The pizza was good, thin crust style, a round pizza cut in \"squares\" (I prefer standard cutting ). Toppings were high quality, all in all a solid but not exceptional pizza. Unfortunately my main gripe is the price. $19 for a small, thin crust pizza? This is simply too much. If the pizza was $10-12 and made in 15-20 minutes, this would be a four star spot.",

We have been dying for a traditional Chicago style pizza and finally we have found what is by far hands down the closest to Lou Malnati's River a North on Wells in Chicago!  The thin crust is flaky and the sausage is flavorful! Although the sauce is a little loose for Chicago and could be a tad sweeter with a touch of basil, the fresh grated Parmesan cheese was the perfect touch.  5 stars until our next visit!",

He dropped off my food and didn't give me a fork no napkins no plates. Nothing. Andrew came over and offered to give pepper and the bartender also took the tip to bring us napkins and forks. Maybe he thought that we weren't going to tip because of how young we look or what his issue was. I did nothing to deserve that lack of service. I work in a restaurant. I would have been fired if I gave that lack of service.",

This experience made our night and we hope David gets recognized for his kind gesture! Give this man a raise!",

(I know, a little weird to have our toddler there) As soon as we sat down, we immediately knew we made the right decision...seeing the bartender knew exactly how to take care of my family. David was probably the best and friendliest bartender we've ever had the pleasure of sitting with. He was quick, extremely personable...and catered to our son like no other restaurant staff has before. Our son Benjamin was ecstatic when David brought out a pizza cookie with a candle for him to blow out.   Honestly we live near happy valley and 67th...and this oreganos just happened to be the one we were near at the time. However, after meeting and having the time of our lives due to the service, we are going to continue to make the drive to this oreganos.   Furthermore, constantly having new business associates I have to take out to lunch on a weekly basis, there is no doubt making a trip to this restaurant is definitely within reason. Great job and thank you guys again for everything.",

Although I had been there once before, this was the first time I had eaten inside due to the heat.  After a few minutes inside we felt it was rather chilly inside so I went to my car to grab a jacket for my girlfriend to wear.  After coming back in and sitting down, Mike, whom I believe was the manager on duty that day approached us to let us know he had adjusted the a/c so it wouldn't be so cold inside.    Not only was our food great, but thanks to our server and especially Mike for being so thoughtful and kind, our overall experience at Oregano's was absolutely amazing.  It's the little things in life that count and I appreciate good customer service when I see it.  Thank you, Mike and your staff for the great food and great customer service experience!  We will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "Wow!! I LOVE Oregano's GLUTEN-FREE pizza! It's served thin crust style that comes in a 10 inch size (it's usually cut into 6 slices and about the size of a plate). Depending on how hungry you are, it's possible to share! You can also pick up to three toppings (I got chicken, green peppers, and black olives on mine)! They put the tomato sauce on, then the toppings, and finally the cheese on top!   The pizza is always AMAZING! Oregano's is one of my favorite places to get gluten-free Italian foods from! Even though the pizza is thin crust, it's never dry and doesn't taste like a cracker (in fact, it's pretty thick compared to some of the thin crust pizzas I've ever had)! My boyfriend got his own thin crust pizza (regular) and said he really couldn't taste the difference.  On the gluten-free menu, you also have 3 dishes to pick from that can be substituted with gluten-free penne noodles. There noodles aren't crunchy or grainy either, but incredibly soft and smooth! For your sides, you only have 3 options. The rest lists the different salad options. All dressings are gluten-free so to make any salad gluten-free, they basically put the croutons to the side. My favorite is the house Italian dressing!   Lastly, they do offer a selection of ciders as well! I'm obsessed over the fact that Oregano's has such a nice selection of gluten-free items. My hope for the future is they add more gluten-free pastas onto the menu! I'm never disappointed when I come in!",

To start, we had fried calamari that was delightful, not too fishy and cooked to perfection. We split a 14\" thin crust pepperoni pizza (definitely couldn't finish that with 2 people) that was cut in squares just like we liked.  GRAND FINALE: THE DESSERT. You have to make sure and save room for this. The chocolate chip cookie skillet topped with ice cream and chocolate chips was over the top and one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted!   The vibe and decor was very vintage and jazz music in the background made it a very relaxed and chill environment.  Overall, you have to check this place out, you won't be sorry!",

My favorite salad is the Pablo Picasso Salad - Fajita Chicken, Romaine, cotija cheese, shredded cheese, tomatoes, cilantro, onion, chipotle ranch ANDDDDD corn tortilla chips. Tip: the Salad is huge, I order the dressing on the side so I can save half for lunch the next day. Another tip: I'll order the salad as an appetizer sometimes and share with 2-3 more people.   I hardly ever leave without ordering a pizookie. I typically order chocolate chip. You can also choose from peanut butter chocolate or white chocolate macadamia nut. This baby comes out hot with scoops ice cream on top! Better eat fast so all the ice cream doesn't melt .",

This is not a grab and go place, but a time to sit back and enjoy without rush. Even with call again seating we had to wait 30 minutes once we checked in. No where to sit and wait. They do deliver food and that may be a huge holdup to the kitchen. All in all a good experience and the food is good but there is room for improvement",

The service is always solid the pizza is always good although I wouldn't say it's the best pizza in the city but it's definitely pretty darn good and the service is always friendly and nice. I'll come here once every month or two when I'm Just craving pizza.  I can tell you this. Never had a bad experience here. I would say that the only downside is sometimes there's a wait.

The salads were a meal by themselves and the pizza was 14 inches. I went with the pizza. I ordered at 4 pm and the place was not busy. After waiting 40 minutes for a cheese pizza I asked about my meal. Moments later it was brought to me. Pizza was paper thin and greasy. Bottom line was poor service, inability to get a small side salad, lousy pizza and it cost $20. They're were many large groups so have to assume this is the place for 6+ people but not the place for a party of one. Unsure why so many other reviews were more positive than mine.",

We arrived around 2 pm, flight landed at noon. So a late lunch. We ordered a thin pizza crust with guacamole that was fresh and delicious. Then had some wings that were awesome. I had the \"pretty hot\" wings and they had a good kick to them. Then, my Sicilian side couldn't resist 2 Italian sausages that hit the spot.  The drinks and service were good as well. We sat outside and enjoyed the atmosphere. We will back this summer and call on Oregano's once again. Ok, night two of two day vacation and we ate here again!!  What does that tell you? Forgetaboutit! Had the thin crust pizza and calamari. Both excellent.  See you in July!!",

Why not go to Oregano's!   The great thing is it was just after 1 PM on a Tuesday and I was seated right away. A waiter came by with some water and I ordered the meatball sandwich with waffle fries $7.99. Great service! Great price!  The sandwich came out within minutes, two large meatballs on tasty roll with some sauce. And crispy waffle fries, ketchup and a dill slice. Great food!  The atmosphere is great, casual but upscale. Lots of stuff on the walls and ceiling to look at. Why eat fast food when you can eat at a nice restaurant for less cost??",

The atmosphere is very relaxed, the drinks are pretty cheap, and they do not rush you at all.

Not that big of a deal. Nobody's perfect all the time. i sent it back and the manager came over and asked if i wanted something different since i did not like the salad (started out very nice) i really wanted that salad. he informed me that this is the way the salad comes and if i did not like it to get something else, and better yet eat somewhere else. i was in a state of shock for a moment and took the advise of going somewhere else. I will go back to Oregano's just not the Old Town location.",

We ate the 14 pc chix wings spicy hot they where not spicy hot just a level below spicy hot we enjoyed them, also had the guacamatony the quac was good  fresh chunky tasty... the very thin pizza crust served with it is well... as always very very salty ! we have eaten this appetizer before same recipe very very salty crust ... heck we just washed it down with a few beers no problem then we split a ribeye salad very good nice fat free serrano pepper dressing good consistent tasting food at this establishment.  We will be back once a month we dine there.",

When I talked to the restaurant manager, he said (and I quote) \"unfortunately, that type of thing happens here at this time of year.\"    I then went on to say that, as regular customers,  we were very disappointed because dinner also took us 2.5 hours(a very long wait with 2 kids...)!   Service was terrible and unbelievably slow.   The manager's response was (and I quote) \"yeah, I guess that is the down side of coming to Scottsdale's most popular restaurant.\"   Are you kidding?!    I reminded him that there are countless options in Scottsdale, and he'd just lost some loyal and frequent (year round) customers...  No apology whatsoever.   The manager of this restaurant couldn't care less that we were robbed and had a horrible dining experience.   Beware...",

If someone, somehow, extended an invitation to me to rename this chain, it would be Orgegano's Giant Salad Bistro or Oregano's Amazing Sandwich Bistro or even Oregano's Bellinis and Pizzookies Bistro. Those are what I love about this place. The pizza in my mind is a little weak - I don't like how they cute them in squares and the flavors are too overpowering, like they need to take of one ingredient on each menu item. But everything else is AWESOME - their Italian Gold wings are sooo good and the Oregano's Favorite Salad - its literally the size of your HEAD.",

When we showed up that evening, they couldn't have been more accommodating to us.  They had a great location for us, and we got a great server.  I feel horrible I can't remember her name, but she was great!!!!  Joanie even came by a few times to check on us.    I've been there a few other times and they never disappoint. From the atmosphere, to the service, to the food.  Always a great time!  Always worth the drive.

Sure if this was an upscale restaurant that was on another level then other Italian food places then I can justify the wait, but in my opinion it's not. Obviously I am one of the few people who doesn't think this place is that great. Once you are seated at an Italian restaurant most places have complimentary bread or something to hold you over for a while especially when you are waiting forever to get your food. To be fair they have $4 garlic bread which is pretty huge and tasty. As someone who drinks a lot of soda I appreciated the massive drink cups they have. The food came out and a few people were underwhelmed that they waiting as long as they did for what they got. The staff was friendly so that was at least nice. The parking in this location is terrible. On most nights you are forced to find parking in a dirt parking lot because there are too many people there. I have been here a few times and every time it was just decent. Nothing has ever blown me away about this place. I think it is overrated.",

My DH ordered a sausage sandwich and was concerned about \"just how spicy is it?\" Jackie said it wasn't \"that hot\" but it had a kick to it. Spice is subjective and to us it was very spicy. Jackie was very attentive as she was working many areas and hustling, she was quick to apologize and asked to bring him something else.  DH ordered an Italian Beef Sandwich as a substitute. It was delicious. They use a Havarti cheese that gives a nice taste that we haven't found anywhere else.  The sandwich was moist and juicy A+. Made me wish I had ordered one instead of my flat cheese pizza, but he was nice enough to share  = )  The waffle cut fries were also a hit.  The manager could not have been nicer and stopped by our table to make sure everything was to our liking twice. Adam/manager and Jackie would be reason enough for us to come back again....not to mention that sandwich!   Being newbies to Oregano's, every dish that was carried past us had us drooling as we said  \"mmmmm next time lets order that\".  We'll be back.",

They have some great appetizers such as the \"Toasted Ravioli Espaniol\", which is fried raviolis that are filled with jalapeno cheese with jalapeno cheese with marinara sauce.   The sandwiches are also very good and very big. My favorite is the Big Beef Sandwich, which is made up of a half pound of rib eye beef, peppers, onions, cheese, and a special spicy sauce.  Oregano's Pizza is outstanding. You can choose either thin crust, pan, or stuffed and any combination from a very extensive list of toppings. Some of the unique options include salami, hatch green chiles, scallions, fajita chicken, sundried tomatoes, alfredo sauce, and cajun chicken.  Oregano's also has a pretty good selection of beers, a decent wine list, and limited hard liquor options.  The pizza cookie for dessert is something of a legend around Phoenix. Save some room for dessert as you don't want to skip this amazing dish.  The above average food and large portions gives Oregano's an above average rating of four stars.",

We got a great table on the patio. I loved the outdoor patio, plus those huge over head heaters kept us toast warm. Our server Heather was very perky and fun and friendly. We had food envy, checking out other people's tables to check out their food. Everything looked \"huge\" and yummy!   We had the Big Rig Pasta and the Pasta Basta. The Big Rig was super yummy rigatoni covered with the best tomato-chipotle cream sauce. I loved it so much!!! Basta was penne, feta cheese, kalamata olives, pine nuts, and sun-dried tomatoes. These yummy dishes were both less than $9 and enough to eat for a couple days. B. J. really wanted to try the lasagna, but they warn you right on the menu that they take extra time and we couldn't wait!   For dessert, we couldn't pass up on trying a pizza cookie. We picked the White Chocolate Macadamia Nut. It was SO good.  Who doesn't like a freshly baked hot, hot cookie topped with ice cream?  Oh, yum!   The food here is very delicious and the atmosphere is very fun. I love Oregano's!",

And of course, they are known for their melt in your mouth dessert, the pizza cookie (aka pizzookie). Save room for this bad boy, because no Oregano's meal is complete without it.

Although parking can be a challenge at this location, if you get there before 11:30 and secure a seat on the patio, it is, overall, a very nice, relaxing dining experience.    I ordered the Vino Bambino Jr. Salad ($6.99) which is \"romaine lettuce with corkscrew pasta, black olives, red bell peppers, pinto beans, scallions, parmesan cheese and fresh cilantro topped with wine-marinated chicken, sauteed onions, red bell peppers and sun-dried tomatoes.\"  I substituted fat-free Roasted Red Pepper Italian dressing for the caesar.  Overall, it was very light and delicious but filling. Although, I really wanted a big, greasy sandwich with sweet potato fries!    My friend had the Jr. Oregano's Favorite Salad (add chicken) which includes romaine lettuce, sun dried tomatoes, kalamata olives, spiced feta cheese, roasted red peppers, red onions, pine nuts and raisins, and she took half of it home.

Luckily, Oregano's will help you with your little problem.  They've got wine, oh yeah.  And at a great price.  They've got an large, open waiting area with comfy seats.  They've got a cozy setting hidden just off of a bustling avenue.  And they've got the kind of food that can please everyone.  That means everyone from your crotchety grandfather who hasn't dined out since the 60s to your Mountain Dew infused punk of a cousin who likes to urinate on animals.    Here ya go.  I really REALLY like their lasagna (though not good for group dining cos it takes 45 mins, yo) and I want to marry their garlic bread.  Sharing pizza is good all around, and the presentation is nice.

The delicious \"Guac-a-Tony\" avocado dip, Italian style, served with thin crispy pizza crust was almost enough of a meal for the three of us. We added a deep dish with fresh veggies on top and it was chunky and simply dreamy.  I drop off one star for one reason only... no Happy Hour... Guys there are 70 other places to eat within walking distance and you need to at least offer a buck off draft or something. To think you are above the economy is suicidal. People like me SEEK happy hour pricing because we like to feel we're getting the best value.",

With that being said, if you anticipate this, Oregano's is one of the most unique and savory pizza / Italian joints around.  The portions are ridiculous, even a small is like a large or an extra large.  Pizza is unbelievable and the time capsule of the ambiance is really special.  They take you back to the 50's and 60's and with great customer service, they really bring back a piece of childhood with the food served family style to such unique themes.  Reminds me of eating at the dinner table or living room with the family when I was little.  They have a great entry outside dining concept with little Italian tables and chairs, along with a cool wine / open outdoor walk up bar to help you forget about the wait time to be seated.  Really well executed.  Wish they were closer to home in California.",

    "text": "For you Midwestern or East Coast pizza connoisseurs that have longed for a truly tasty, thin crust pizza here in Phoenix, this is the place. Being from Milwaukee that boasts two of the greatest thin crust pizza joints in the world (Zaffiro's and Tomaso's - I can say this because I've eaten at the best in Rome as well), I had given up on finding good pizza in the valley. Finally, I tried Oregano's and it was truly a joy. They now even have Sierra Nevada on tap!   The pizza has a flawless thin crust, which is crispy throughout, just bubbling up at the edges. The sauce is more than adequate (most places nowadays are dry) and has a nice blend of spices - not overly sweet like many places. Finally, the quality of the cheese is quite good- not like Wisconsin, but I'll give them a pass. And they have REAL, fresh Parmesan cheese, do not pass it up when offered.   This is my second experience (first in Scottsdale) and both times it was consistent. I will return often, however, I may decide to drive to the one on Camelback -there's  more room and better ambiance.",

I'd recommend the pizza cookie, angel hair pasta, spinach artichoke dip, etc. The atmosphere and decor give the place a great feel and the old music and black 'n' white 50's movies are awesome. Their specialty drinks are strong, which is good, but might be too sweet for some.  I'd recommend this place for groups or a date. Friendly service from the hostess to servers.  Plus they have fun sayings on their shirts, which you can buy, like \"Wanna Pizza Me\". Think about it.  Take note:  --The parking lot is small, typical of most Oregano's locations, and be careful where you park around so you are not towed.  --They do NOT take reservations, the wait can sometimes be long during lunch and dinner hours.  --The only food criticism I have is of their baked sandwiches; the outer bread crust can be very hard making it difficult to eat and bite into.",

    "text": "Oregano's always results in overeating.  This used to be my thing and I sometimes find myself falling off the wagon.  Oregano's certainly helps.  Everything here is big: the menu, the portions, the wait for a table.  The actual restaurant itself is rather small and split across two structures with a meager parking lot in the middle.  The Phoenix location has a more sensical layout, but is just as crazy busy.  We also call it Gaytalian, whereas the Scottsdale location is just Italian.  My one recommendation is to not get an appetizer.  The garlic bread is massive and gooey, the guacatoni is guacalicious and the fried ravioli are just the right abuse of a deep fryer.  However, if you do get a starter you will never get to dessert still able to consume food.  Remember those big portions?  The meal will do you in and you will miss the best part of Oregano's - The Pizookie.  It's a cookie that's not fully baked and topped with ice cream.  You should try all three flavors: Chocolate Chip, Peanut Butter Chocolate, and White Chocolate.  Oh, yea.  The main food.  The lasangas are stellar, specifically the artichoke one.  The salads are the weak spot, but the meatball sub had four bulldozer-sized soft meatballs.  I usually go for the deep dish pizza stuffed with unending amounts of cheese, but the flat pizzas have more variety and work well to share.  That's the big thing here.  Share or risk massive waist expansion.  And if you care to drink, you need to have a bellini.  It's a frozen drink of wonder and has schnapps, rum, wine, and champagne.  It's like the whole bar in one glass.    It's important to recognize that going to Oregano's is an event and will take time.  However, with the friendly servers, the constant access to beverages, and the cool Chicago Italian decorations, you won't mind the time.",

Waited about 10 minutes for a table (got one outside...where you should be sitting at night). Yeah it was 100 degrees, but who cares. The misters and AC make up for it. It's really not that bad. In fact, it's great!  Once you sit down, you'll get a menu. It's larger than the table!! And a lot of the print is small, so if it's dim outside, I suggest bringing a flashlight. Kidding. Use your phone. Hee hee.  I ordered the Big Rig. A nice hearty portion of rigatoni with a fantastic tomato sauce that has a hint of chipotle. Two delicious slices of garlic bread. All for under 10 bucks.  The service is fantastic. Servers are VERY attentive.   I peeked at the pizzas on other tables and they looked fantastic.  THIS is your fantastic date spot. It's not pretentious, but it's not weak either. A cozy atmosphere, with great food that you can share.   One suggestion: Try the Bollo Pasta. A giant bowl of linguini with a tomato sauce. It tastes like the linguini was born in the sauce (LA Friends...Gardens of Taxco anyone?....) It's all you can eat too. And cheap. 6-7 bucks.  I'd come back. I'd also come back after that. I want to try everything on the menu!",

I admit, I didn't order any pizza, so if that's what you should go there for, I'll have to make another visit.  But I've heard good things about their food in general and I was completely unimpressed. I ordered the beefstro salad with a \"LARGE\" amount of shaved rib-eye. There was nothing of the sort. Yeah, there was meat, but let's not go overboard by saying a LARGE amount in all caps. It was mediocre at best. Plus, my boyfriend's meatball sandwich came out literally 10 minutes before my food. He was almost done when I got my meal. That's a huge no-no at a restaurant. I was extremely annoyed. His meatball sandwich was nothing special. Seems no restaurant makes legit meatballs, just some canned bullshit that tastes generic. To top it all off, when my boyfriend was offered sweet potato fries or waffle fries, the server failed to tell him it was a $1 more for sweet potato fries. I guess it's on the menu, but if you're going to make it sound like it's an equivalent choice of sides, how should we know? You have to make that clear when offering. Duh.  The server was friendly and the overall atmosphere seemed nice, but that was a fairly lame experience. I doubt I'll even go back to give the pizza a try, too many delicious pizza places around to waste my time.",

    "text": "Ordered 3 thin crust pizzas to go. 1. Chicken Pesto 2. Sausage Mushroom 3. Plain Cheese.  I ate a few pieces of the Sausage Mushroom and something didn't seem right, but I couldn't place it.  I thought the Sausage had extra fennel seed which gave it a kind of spicy kick.  Then I tried the plain cheese and it hit me, the spiciness was from an insane amount of Oregano.   Guess this is why they called it Oregano's.  I am a big fan of Oregano, but this was nuts.  The pizza was almost a job to eat.  Not enjoyable at all.   Of the 7 people eating only 1 of us enjoyed the pizza cheese and sausage/mushroom pizzas.  The chicken pesto did not have the way over the top oregano flavor so it must have been in the tomato sauce and left out of the pesto sauce.  That pizza wasn't bad, but still average at best.    I have had excellent thin crust from all over the country and based on the tons of reviews here I expected a lot.   This place was a let down for sure.",

The Moscow Mule tasted like mouthwash. Appetizer took 20 minutes to arrive. We go there because it is good for the kids, but on this trip, when we asked for the pizza dough balls they are generally provided to play with, we were told there were none available. In a pizza place there is no dough available?! Our entrees arrived, but the kids pizza slices were no where to be seen. When we asked about them, we were told they would be out promptly. Twenty minutes later, their slices arrived. They were so hot even an adult would have to wait a good five minutes to eat them. Obviously they had been forgotten. I ordered a dirty martini up. The waitress said the bartender wasn't sure what \"up\" meant. I explained. She then asked if I still wanted it shaken with ice. Needless to say we left before dessert. We waited fifteen minutes to get the check even though we took our credit card up to the front. It will be a long while before we go back to this place again.",

    "text": "The only thing \"Chicago style\" at Oregano's is the time it takes to get your pizza once it's been ordered. I called on a Sunday night and was told it would be 90 minutes before I could come pick it up. I arrived right on time, and my pizza & garlic bread were pulled from an under-the-counter heater and handed over.   Clearly, I'm starving having had to wait so long until dinner so I'm pretty excited to pull the pizza out of the box and get it on to the plate once I make it back home. Though when I lifted the lid, the excitement fizzled. The pizza did not look fresh, and when I pulled out the first thin crust slice it fell limp and nearly slid itself back into the box. That was worrisome so I carefully transfered a few more squares over, then opened the foil for the garlic bread. More sogginess, and by the looks of the bread it may have been placed under my pizza box inside the pizza-kryptonite heater. Adding insult to injury, the pizza was cool! I actually had to put it in the microwave less than 10 minutes after picking it up. Seriously?!  The first bite of both were equally disappointing. It was hard to handle the pizza squares because they were so limp/soggy, and when I folded it in half the topping separated from the crust as if it had been placed there as a late afterthought. Thin crust pizza should be CRISPY! It doesn't qualify as \"thin crust\" just because the crust is thin! And I've had better garlic bread come with a frozen dinner.  Very disappointed. 1 - If my pizza had been ready earlier than they told me to arrive, they should have called me. They took my number when I placed the order. 2 - The phrase \"Chicago-Style Pizza\" should be regulated like organic and kosher. It's clearly being abused by this establishment. Next time I'll satisfy my craving in the frozen section of the grocer.",

Their Veggie Wedge is really delicious and there are still many meatless options when dining at Oregano's.    The Pizza Cookie is always on the list of things to eat and we always get it half/half.    In ten years I have never been disappointed by the staff members or the food.  Great people, great fun and always great food.  The new Dobson/Southern location is the closest to my home so I have been eating there since it opened.  The location in Tempe and Old Town Scottsdale have been visited in the past.   Parking has consistently been an issue when going to Oregano's, but the Mesa location has plenty compared to the other two I have visited.  Enjoy!",

He loved his sandwich and I enjoyed my salad but I'm disappointed in how HUGE the portions are. This is why America is obese. I'm sorry but as much as people get excited about huge portions for their money, it's ridiculous to me. No one needs that much food!! Places like this really turn me off b/c they only contribute to the obesity epidemic. Yes you can have it for lunch the next day but you can't help but overeat at this place. I personally won't return but I'm sure my bf will cause he loves deep dish pizzas. I'm giving 4 stars for the taste but still, they need to have some portion control here.",

The ambience is Italian pizzeria w/ Frank Sinatra playing in the background. Highly recommend ordering the Antipasto to share w/ the table. There is enough food on that plate to feed 4! Best antipasto I have ever experienced. Trust me when I say this isn't a salad you eat, it's an experience. Also had their thin crust pizza w/ sausage. That pizza pie was tasty as well.

    "text": "I moved to Phoenix about two months ago and have driven by a few Oregano's numerous times, wondering if it's any good. There's a location down the street from my work, so I decided to treat myself for lunch yesterday. As soon as I walked in, a couple people at the front greeted me and took me to a table immediately. It was during the lunch rush so the place was close to full, but not packed.  My server, Aryiel, came by right away for my drink order. I ordered a water and let her know I wanted to order the cheese deep dish pizza (I checked out the menu beforehand). She did let me know that the deep dish pizza takes about 40 minutes to cook, so I had to change my order because I only have an hour for lunch. I was bummed but appreciative that she gave me a heads up. She suggested the stuffed pizza lunch of the day which was sausage and pepperoni. I'm not a big sausage person but decided to give it a try since she said it would be ready much faster. I also ordered it with a side salad. My water came right out, and within minutes, my salad followed. As soon as I finished the salad, my pizza came out and she cleared the salad plate. The manager came up as I was eating and asked how everything was and Aryiel also checked on me once or twice.  I was only able to eat about half and took the rest to go. I had a coupon for a free Pizza Cookie (sign up for them email list and you get it right away) so I also ordered that to go, without the ice cream.  Overall, I thought the food was delicious and I couldn't have asked for better service. I got a LOT of food for only $9 and change, so maybe lunch is the way to go price-wise.",

I tried the Big Beefy Sandwich and after a slight mix up that was promptly fixed i enjoyed every overstuffed bite of it. The sweet potatoes fries, let me just say this place now holds the gold standard for them! Wow! My mouth is already watering just thinking about them.   The food as stated was superb but what sets this place apart is the staff. From the manager down to the hostess we were well greeted and served. Even with the slight mix up food was prompt, hot, and tasty.   Now the Giant Cookie....just get it and pay for the calories later. It is hot warm and gooey and the ice cream takes care of that burning sensation on your tongue.   Thanks for a wonderful visit and I will be including this Oreganos on my next journey to Scottsdale.",

The stuffed mushrooms were a bit plain, they didn't have enough going on, just some meat piled into a portobello.  I wish I had had time to try the Chicago stuffed pizza, but it takes 40 minutes and a group doesn't always want to wait that long.  Based on my experience, the stuffed pizza is likely delicious as well.",

I've tried a number of pasta dishes that were all big in portion size, but left me unsatisfied when it comes to flavor. I love, love, love their kickbutt garlic bread appetizer with cheese and marinara sauce. It was the perfect start to the meal and it was like 2 feet long! The best thing I have had here by far is the numero one-o Chicago style deep dish pizza. It took a while to make but we knew what we were getting into. It was so huge that we could each only eat one piece! We substituted mushrooms for jalapenos and it was the best choice ever because that transformed our pizza into a spicy treasure. We were both surprised at the kick (which we loved) that came with these red jalapenos. I had a bloody mary, which was decent, and Eric got a margarita that he enjoyed. The service is top-notch with our server constantly checking on us and apologizing for the wait for our pizza. The deep dish is extremely huge and took a lot longer than the other dishes that you can order, so be aware that the wait is inevitable and be patient!",

Typically, I normally I have to ask for my drinks to be filled, extra napkins for wings and even extra plates for the wings but she brought them out without us even having to ask.   We ordered 6 different dishes. All of which exceeded our expectations: the garlic wings,  the bruschetta, the big rig, the lady is a scampi, and the stuffed rigatoni. And don't forget the calamari.  Thank you so much again Miranda for the best dining experience we have had in a while. I would recommend this Oreganos location to anyone.",

It is an Italian version of quacamole and served with ultra thin bread. The guac has fresh basil throughout it. It is plentiful and addicting. I will return just for this!!  I would pass on the calamari appetizer. It was served extremely greasy and the batter was super dark/brown. My assumptions is that they didn't change out the oil for frying for quiet sometime. The calamari meat itself was tender so this is the reason of my assumption.   I can ONLY recommend the quacamole appetizer.",

We had to place the baby in her car seat on the floor, there was nothing to accomodate her.  And, there was another toddler next to us with no high chair.

The moment  I saw this place, I had a feeling that this place was going to be good.  This place was busy and while waiting, we were directed to the bar area.  Watching other patrons eating their pizza made me salivate; however, there is one problem for me: Lent.  I sacrificed red meat-beef, pork, lamb, etc.  I'm hungry now just thinking about their delicious pizza. I just have to experience vicariously through my friends.  My friends ordered a large thin crust pizza and the raved it so much and they were rubbing it in my face.  They said the crust is fabulous! They liked folding it over to eat \"new york style.\"   I ordered the chicken lasagne and it was awesome.  My only problem that it gets cold fast.  I also loved the garlic cheesy bread.  My wife and I shared a large salad , which was plentiful. I would have preferred trying the other salads.   The staff was pleasant and friendly . The outdoor dining area is great, especially during the evening under the Arizona sky.   We will DEFINITELY be back here on our next trip to Scottsdale! I can't wait!!!",

I tell the lady who brought the salad (not my waiter) that I had it with chicken.. So I go to hand her the salad as I'm expecting a new one brought out since that is what you are supposed to do.... The staff member goes to take it & then says oh I'll just bring you some chicken.. I said no that's okay & she says go ahead eat I'll have it brought out... Are you serious-that ruined the meal right there...I don't care how busy you are there is no excuse for laziness and poor customer service. My waiter later brought out a side of chicken to dump in my salad..That is ridiculous take the meal back & bring me back what I ordered correctly. I called the manager when I got home later (I should have asked for the manager while I was there but didn't)  & she said they never should have done that & she was sorry I had a bad experience... She further said she hoped I would give them another try... Really that's how you handle an unsatisfied customer by simply saying you're sorry! Wow Oregano's I expected more from you that that. I'm a regular customer but won't be anymore if this is your new standard of customer service well lack there of making the customer suck it up ignoring what they ordered just because they didn't want to take the meal back & make it again. It's really pathetic because the food is typically really good but the bad customer service ruins it!",

There is something about 1/2 lb. of cookie dough baked in a deep dish pizza pan served warm and gooey, then topped with three scoops of vanilla ice cream. Nothing better. I think they recently started offering new flavor cookies (chocolate chip, peanut butter chocolate chip, and white chocolate macadamia nut) PLUS they allow you to do halves of two different kinds.   I went twice when I was in town for a week, once for regular dinner date and the other time for my birthday celebration after a nice dinner...as in we left the fancy restaurant and came here just for the dessert. This might explain the few pounds I gained but it was worth every delicious calorie.   As for the rest of the food, their pan pizza is really good. We built our own with sausage, green peppers, and sauteed onions. It took about 40 minutes for them to make, but it was no big deal since we were handsomely rewarded with a delicious meal. Our waitress was super nice and came back a few times to check on us and get drink refills. The wait here is always crazy long (around 30-90 minutes) but I say stick it out...or go eat at the bar.",

Some of the menu items I've had:  Garlic Bread, $4.99 Toasted Ravioli, $6.99 Bruschetta, $7.39 Mini Stuffed Pizza, $6.79 18\" Thin Crust Numero Uno (Pepperoni, Sausage, Mushrooms, Onions, Green Peppers), $25.50  The Garlic Bread is evil.....it's very good and addicting.  I could eat it all day long.  The Toasted Ravioli and Bruschetta are good, not the best, but above average.  The Thin Crust Pizza is my fav though.  We order it \"well done\" so it comes out crispy and the Cheese has a slight burn on top.  They do it right here....soooo good!  I was convinced by a co-worker to try the Mini Stuffed Pizza one day....it was good, but I could only have 1 slice, it was too filling.

Not even joking i could count the number of rigatoni pasta noodles that were in the container. Even my coworkers were like that's a ripoff you should take it back. While the pasta was delicious as always I am still super hungry. :(",

Families, couples, singles, teenagers out for a bite, convivial staff. Overall just a pleasant experience. I highly recommend it for everyone.  The Chicago style pie is as close to Chicago style pan pizza as one can get without eating at Lou Malnati's in Chicago. Couldn't tell the difference to be honest. i usually order to go and have a beer at the bar while i wait or eat at the bar and service is good.  Enjoy!",

I just can't continue to go there. The place is now such a cave. You can tell they did as little as possible to get the place open. But that's not what really sealed the deal. I actually have stopped going to Oreganos all together since they changed their pasta supplier. The new pasta has a terrible consistency and is very gummy. I had been going to Oreganos for about 15 years but the changes that have been made recently have stopped me from going to all locations. It's sad that it used to be my favorite restaurant but when they seem to have traded quality for profit it's no longer the place it used to be.",

I had the shrimp Diablo pasta, and he had the pesto penne bake- both were incredible! The shrimp Diablo was creamy and spicy and wonderful- a large portion but not so large that it's impossible to eat. His pesto penne bake was cheesy and delicious, served in a bread bowl- his was also a really good size portion. The server we had was a new-bee, you could tell he was nervous, but he served our table of 6 quickly and without issue, I wish I had gotten his name so I could give him credit!",

Great food - you can't go wrong with the food. Everything is GREAT! My favorite salad is the Pablo Picasso and our fave pizza is the pesto with sausage.",

We ended up getting their thin crust pizza. Which was awesome. He checked in on us a couple times and got us our refills before they were gone. Mike the manager also checked in on things and we noticed he was going around helping his staff with whatever they needed. We ended up learning that Daniel was short staffed in the bar which made him even more amazing because he tended to us in a very timely manner for handling everything on his own. I will definitely go back her again and request him as our server. Thanks Daniel!",

Their pizzas can take anywhere from 25-40 minutes to cook, so you don't want to be starving yourself, smelling all the Oreganos goodness, feeling tortured with every table that gets their delicious smelling pizza before you.   Trust me.  Also, save room for pizookie. It's a skillet baked cookie that's just every so slightly underdone so that it's soft and gooey...and then they top it with ice cream. Can you say heaven in a skillet?? Try a half macadamia nut and half chocolate chip so you get the best of both worlds.",

Fast forward to us arriving at the restaurant....and the hostess says \"hi! I will mark you as checked in, it will be another 20-30 minutes.\" Umm no, girlfriend, it most certainly will not be another 20-30 minutes. Oregano's has great food and amazing servers but this whole Yelp integration kills the experience. Don't promise people 15 minutes if it won't be 15 minutes. We won't be returning for awhile, the Tucson Speedway location has it down to an art with the Yelp experience....take after them, Scottsdale!",

Maybe not quite enough for 5 people, so if you've got a large group, be sure to order 2. We had the cookie and ice cream for dessert - phenomenal! Like the dip, order 2 if you've got a party of 5 or more.   Our waiter was very nice and attentive. The atmosphere is fun and kid friendly.

This was apparent when we walked in and the place was packed! The only open seating was at the bar. We sat down and were immediately greeted by the bartender who was warm and welcoming. She was very polite and engaged in conversations with customers while mixing drinks.   We ordered garlic bread, wings, and pan pizza. Right as we had finished eating our garlic bread, the power went out due to a monsoon. The staff remained calm, refilled drinks, and kept the positive environment even though we had no power. They let everyone stay until it was safe to leave. Although we didn't eat anything more than garlic bread that night, it was good enough that we wanted to come back and try the pizza.  I came back two days later because the environment was so great! We ordered a pan pizza and some chicken. The staff tell you upfront that the pan pizzas take about 40 minutes to make. It was WELL worth the wait. The pizza is delicious! There is so much cheese yet the pizza wasn't overly greasy and the crust was cooked to perfection.  Even though its hard to find parking sometimes; if you are stopping by or driving through this area, Oregano is a place worth stopping for.",

    "text": "So I should start out by saying - I have been to Oregano's countless times. It's ALWAYS a great experience, and definitely one of my go-to places. I should also mention that if you're looking for light / healthy options, you might as well not read my review. What we ordered was in no way light or healthy... But DANG was it good!   Our server was extremely friendly and on top of it. I never have a problem with poor service here though (one of the many reasons I love it). My friend and I started out with the boom dip. BEST SPINACH ARTICHOKE DIP EVER. I promise... Get this. For our entrees, we really wanted to try something new since we have had pretty much everything on the menu. We noticed a gentleman at the table next to us had ordered a delicious looking pasta dish, but we couldn't identify what it was on the menu. We asked our server what he had ordered and his answer completely changed the game forever... Chicken Parmesan but he had subbed the marinara on it for Alfredo sauce. OK WHAT... THAT'S GENIUS. We said \"why the heck not\" and went with the mystery man's creative creation. It was just as amazing as it looked and my friend and I both agreed that we found our newest guilty pleasure (second to their pazookies).   So like I said, not somewhere to come if you're looking for healthier options. But I will never regret a good Oregano's binge. The prices, the portions, the staff, it really can't be beat. AZ is so lucky to have a joint like this in nearly every neighborhood in the valley!   Warning: Wait times may be long on Fridays and Saturdays. Sometimes they try to compensate for this with Pizza appetizers while you're waiting!",

I went there specifically for their dessert, the pizza cookie pizookie? I didn't realize there were different cookie options like white chocolate macadamia nut, peanut butter/chocolate, chocolate chip and salted caramel. I was even able to, at the bartender's suggestion, get 2 different flavors, half and half. The menu suggested that it's  a dessert for 2-4 people. I think more like 2. I got it for just myself and ate a little over half. It was so good! Less than $6. Not a bad price for a large dessert.   I will be back!!",

My friend tried the red sangria which was much less sweet and very tasty.   With our murder mystery ticket, we were given a buffet of two pastas, garlic bread, and two pizzas. Holy carbs Batman! We did start with a salad which made me feel better, but man did I feel carb overloaded.   The food was very tasty, but was nothing amazing. Except the garlic bread, that was amazing (but unfortunately we were only given one piece). I bet their individual meals taste better, but I wasn't super impressed.   Servers and decor are excellent though, so definitely a good option for a hearty dinner!",

The salads are huge and always fresh.  I love the Pablo Picasso Mexican salad add avocado.  It's my favorite!!  Boom dip to start is a great way to start.  I also like their Calamari appetizer with their spicy red sauce, it wonderful.    The pizza is great depending on what type you are in the mood for, thick crust or thin.  The pasta dishes like the Big Rig or the Alfredo the Dark with Chicken are outstanding. I love their buttery garlic bread.  I've also had a few sandwiches over the years of visiting here and they are pretty decent.  I love the meatball grinder.  You will need a to-go box for sure!!    Dessert, usually this doesn't happen often, however if you have enough people with you I recommend having the cookie with ice cream.  Fresh baked... you choose!  Chocolate chip, macadamia nut, peanut butter, and it's served piping hot!!  Very good!!    Consistency goes a long way in my book... especially since I've been to multiple locations of Oregano's for lunches and dinners over the last 10 years.  They really have it together!!",

You can't go wrong here if you want a lot of food for cheap, good pizza & great service. Between 4 adults we split 2 big salads, a pasta dish & a 12\" deep dish pizza and we had tons of leftovers. The kids meals are a large portion as well and so inexpensive, my son had penne marinara, broccoli & milk for less than $5. We ended our meal with a pizza cookie which I highly suggest as well. If you sign up for their email club on their website you get a free pizza cookie, so we did so before we arrived. Definitely worth checking out!",

They had just the right amount of bite to them.  We ordered it with light cheese and it came just as ordered.  We ordered the waffle fries too.  They were good, but nothing compares to the pizza which I must add was cut in squares.  Orders the 16\" maybe a little aggressive for two people!  Excited to come back and try the pasta.  Service was quick and great. Shelby was a GREAT server.  Does her job well!",

Instead of waiting and waiting we were all surprised that she was so perfectly even flowed. We had our drinks ordered and delivered within minutes and our food ordered and delivered rather fast for knowing how busy it was. This Oregano's management must be doing a great job! The food was delicious. The pizza wasnt greasy and the toppings were overgenerous. I highly recommend this place!",

The food was spot on and great to see the food hasn't lost it's great flavor. One thing I was disappointed about, no more Fried Ravioli appetizers. They were one of our favorites.

At 745 we check in on the pizza and are informed that it'll be \"just a second\". We sit down at the stools directly in front of the to go counter. Waiting.... waiting.... um.. hello. 825..... we ask again.... they scrambled to find our ticket and we discover that our pizza had been sitting in their warmer for over half an hour. They barely offered more than a \"oh I'm sorry\". Our pizza is soft, not crispy. At least it was still warm, one was straight cold... it was very disappointing and I can't believe they wouldn't comp it or offer anything at all. The bellinis were delicious as always and the hosts were lovely and friendly.",

After being seated, our awesome waitress Kylie took care of us the rest of the evening. We shared the zucchini fries, antipasto salad and a 10\" Chicago pan pizza. All the food was great and the portions are large. If you get pizza, let her dig it out of the pan for you. She talks down her skills, but she's really a pro.  Get your butts to Oregano's and ask for Kylie to take care of you.  Two thumbs up for this joint.  It's on the list for \"let's go at least once a month\".",

It's the salads that really make me love this place. They are giant, fresh, and full of good toppings. It's hard to find a salad that's big enough to fill me up until afternoon snack time, and Oregano's gets the job done every time. My favorites are the Oregano Favorite and the Picasso Mexico salad. The Veggie sandwich is average - the bread tasted a little funny to me, but the caramelized onions and portabella mushrooms were quite yummy. The big slice of pizza for only $2.99 is an awesome deal as well, and the pizza is great thin crust pizza.  This location has outdoor seating, semi-indoor/outdoor seating, True indoor booths, and bar seating so there is a lot to choose from. They are quick with service, even in the midday rush.  The only negative is that they place their music ungodly loudly. It can be hard to hear conversation at the same table and I find it irritates me. If they took it down a few notches, it would be perfect background music.",

    "text": "This review is based on my last 4 or 5 consecutive bad experiences at this location including a $200 pickup order during the Mayweather/Pacquiao fight.  If you'd have asked me a few months ago to list my favorite places to eat in Old Town, this would've been in my top ten- no longer. I ordered food from here several times a week (pick up for lunch) and would meet friends or bring a date here about 1x a month. So.... I can't chalk up this bad review to 1 experience. This place is truly getting bad. Normally, I place an order for pickup and am pretty well taken care of regardless of how busy they are. The last several times I've ordered, everyone plays hot-potato with taking care of my pick up... sometimes I'm waiting for 10 minutes for the bartender or the person who took my order while several servers are pretending to be busy because it's not their problem.  In addition, I've noticed that my regular order (wings) has gone down-hill quite a bit. $10.00 for 10 wings is expensive to start with ... but, until recently, they were always huge, so I never felt ripped off. Wings have gotten much smaller and whoever is in the kitchen doesn't mind giving you a half wing or a runt here and there. Today was the final straw... they raised the price and my order was inadequate.  At the end of the day, it's no longer enough to eat nor a value for the money.    Note to owner or manager:  I want to eat here and give you my money.  Please hire and train staff that are at least willing to provide service and take it from me. Also, stop watering down the soup and raising prices. I've seen a 100 places come and go in Old Town. I can tell you that alienating your clientele won't yield a good result.",

It was very packed, so we had the impression it was going to be phenomenal food. We sat outside, and we immediately fell in love with the environment. We sit there for 20 minutes and we order some drinks. Our service was nothing spectacular, and the server fail to suggest any options. We ordered the Big Rig Pasta; a very dry pasta with no flavor whatsoever. My daughter ordered Lady is A Scampi, very dry pasta as well not worth the money. Furthermore, Alfredo the Dark was dry pasta, little sauce topped with tomato.  In addition, the wings were extremely salty. The pizza was good. The only thing we loved was the dessert! Never coming back, I'd rather stick to the regular Olive Garden or Malee's on Main.",

Food was delicious and wasn't ridiculously priced like most things around here.  I had the stuffed Riga Tony which was excellent and I loved the garlic bread that comes with the meal. Boyfriend had an oregano ziti dish with chicken that he really enjoyed.   Portions are really big.  We also split a Caesar salad (big) which was enough for 4 people.  We had food leftover so I would suggest sharing.",

We give this Oregano's a call right after they open and end up placing a large surprise order for lunch, and they always accommodate and work hard to get us taken care of quickly and efficiently. Their food is always up to par, and they give us everything we need to go with it including extra sauces, utensils, etc. It is nice to know we can count on them on the drop of a dime to take care of our staff's lunch on a busy day and they make it so easy. We always order some pizzas, salads, wings, pastas, and desserts, and everything is fresh and tastes great! The staff helps load everything into the car even! Thank you Oregano's To-Go staff for always helping us out! =)",

The food is really good, the wine is really well priced, the beer list is interesting enough for beer lovers or novices and the patio is great for dining with children.    I like the new location as parking is MUCH easier and one doesn't feel so claustrophobic when you dining inside the restaurant.   I have never had a bad meal here nor have I ever had crappy service.  The dough balls and cookie desert are great touches for the kiddos as well.    They are doing something right...",

We have patronized this restaurant (actually the original store that only moved a couple of blocks so that they could accommodate more people) for many years now.  We have tried many a pizza joint in the valley and always come back to this one.  Oregano's is the place where you bring out of town guests; a place to meet with your local friends or just go with your significant other.  They have pizzas that satisfy the Meat Lover, the Vegan and the Gluten Free customer.  My favorite is the thin crusted Barbecued Chicken, my wife likes Pepperoni, so we usually order a half and half with a cold brew.  It has always been a happy experience with many good memories.  I highly recommend Oregano's to everyone and write this review because it is high time that I did.",

It's packed, so either get in early or just expect to be awhile, which considering, it's a great way to spend some time with friends! Food is phenomal. The deep dish Chicago style pizza is good as it get, west of the mississippi! And, one the most impressive things about Oregano's is their service! Staff is well trained and looks out for the smallest detail to make your evening enjoyable, very refreshing!",

    "text": "I love Oregano's. When I first moved here last year, this was one of the first restuarants I went to, and I've been coming back ever since - sometimes once or twice a week. I'll tell you why...  First, their service: everyone from the hostess, bartenders, servers, and managers are super friendly and they always take care of you. The staff culture really matches the decor and ambiance of the place- fun! even their t-shirts are funny.  Second of course is the food: whether you grab a thin slice for lunch or a deep dish for dinner, you will be glad you did. Everything on the menu is good, and definately try the pizza cookie for dessert.  This Scottsdale location is great. (service is awesome here) Bring your coworkers for lunch. It's also a nice, casual spot for a date, or share a deep dish with your friends. Enjoy!",

A friend has been going to Spring Training for a few years now and always comes home raving about Oregano's.  So when my husband and I were in Arizona last week, we had to give it a try.    Here are my recommendations: Alfredo in the Dark ----- sooo good! Cheesy garlic bread Baked Ziti Baked Pesto with meatballs --- really awesome and I am not a huge meatball fan either. Everyone was stealing them from me. Deep Dish pizza Stuffed Mushrooms  The outdoor seating was great, but as I understand they are moving in a few weeks.  I am sure the next building will be even better.  I really want to remake Alfredo in the Dark at home.  I don't think I can wait until next year.",

    "text": "My family ate here while on vacation. We split a family size salad among four of us. I will note that my daughters are 3 and 7, but it was a huge salad. My wife and I ordered a thin crust pizza. We were planning to order a small numero uno (I think that is what it was called) Unfortunately, we took the servers suggestion and went up a size. It was way to much pizza. The other issue is that he convinced us to split the pizza into a half numero uno and a half Calvin (I think that is the name). What we got, was a full size Calvin. While the pizza was delicious, it was frustrating that we did not get what we ordered. Interesting enough the manager offered to make us another numero uno on top of the pizza we could not finish. We declined. There was no offer of even $5 off. A small deduction off the bill should have been offered. This odd customer service is the only thing keeping this review from 5 stars.",
