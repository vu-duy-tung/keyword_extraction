    "text": "Disclaimer: this review applies ONLY to the Steak 'n Shake in Tempe, AZ.  The reason I want to make that clear is I grew up on Steak 'n Shake in the Midwest in my college days and this is certainly much more gol dang fancier than what they have in the Midwest.  Take into account that this is in the high rent district of Tempe ... no free parking lot so be prepared to add $2 to your meal if this is the only place you're going that day.  The place is kinda urban chic upscale with a nice but small outdoor dining area and a very tiny indoor seating area.  They serve beer and wine but they underplay it so much I didn't know it until I was waiting for my food.  And waiting.  And waiting.  I also counted 3,736 holes in the ceiling tile and watched 196 Volkswagen Beetles pass by the restaurant before FINALLY getting my burger and fries.  There is no way I would ever call this a \"fast food\" restaurant.  And this, mind you, was about 3 PM on a Monday afternoon with only about 20 people in the entire restaurant. Was it worth the wait?  Remember I practically grew up on real Steak 'n Shake drive-ins in the Midwest.  Well ... their standard burger, some fries and their only-sized drink came to just under $6.00 and the fries were awesome.  Me who is not the biggest fan of fries ate most of them before even digging in to the burger.  The soft drink was per usual with the exception that I had no way of figuring out how to use their fancy-dancy soda dispensers so I drank the whole thing without any ice in it.  Come on, get with the program and at least put some sort of label on the machine, huh?  Now, to the critical moment, the burger.  I am SUCH a reverse burger snob.  To me the best burgers I have had in my lifetime are in one-location greasy dives in bum-frick nowhere where it is burger meets bun with maybe some mustard and real cheese in-between and no rabbit food anywhere in sight.  You know, where you can actually taste the meat?  Apparently you can NOT have it your way at this burger joint, you get it with a bunch of toppings they think is the way you want it.    Sadly, I never felt I was sinking my teeth into a meat patty.  I tasted bun. I tasted lettuce (too much).  I tasted pickle. I tasted tomato. I tasted onion. But I tasted no meat nor cheese.  And I did taste something oddly weird and chemically and unsettling.  I have no idea what it was but it just didn't taste \"good\".  It distracted so much from the wonderful taste of a great/good/adequate hamburger I just had to take away two full stars from this Steak 'n Shake just for that reason.  I SO wanted to report that I fell in love with their Tempe location and that I'll be back 1,000 times in the future but after today I must review them more as an old familiar friend that I revisited and saw how they've changed and realized I really don't have much in common with them anymore.  NOTABLES:  * ONE freakin' counter person and a long line?  Um, has this franchisee ever been to any fast food restaurant, anywhere, ever?  Never in my life have I seen only one cashier in a burger joint. * Trash cans that are impossible to dump the contents of the super-deep trays in to?  So people don't and the trash cans are smeared with mustard and ketchup and the super-deep trays are just left unemptied. * A strategically placed 5\" diameter steel railing placed, you guessed it, exactly at eye-level around the outdoor dining area so it is impossible to view the surrounding street life.  WHO came up with that?  S/he is SOOOOO fired. * Employees with the fire and enthusiasm of mortuary workers.  WTF, this is a college town and you can't find even one worker who knows how to smile?",

    "text": "This review is based on the franchise concept of Steak 'n Shake. The negative reviews comparing it to a full version of Steak 'n Shake do not do it justice because it can not compare, different concept, limited menu, different service. At first, I was a little disappointed but when I asked the employee she explained the differences between the Signature and full version.   The burger was tasty, which is a lot coming from me because I am not a big burger person. I was slightly disappointed because the burger I ordered was supposed to come with crispy onion strings and I didn't realize they were missing until I was reheating my leftovers.  The fries are delicious. Perfect amount of salt and crispiness.  The shake was ok. Can't go wrong with a ice cream shake. But just average...probably not worth the price.  The food is very affordable but the shakes are a bit spendy, in my opinion.   I will definitely be back.",

The place is clean and the service is friendly, which to be honest, feels weird when I'm used to a surly waitress giving me the stink eye when I order my food at this chain.    I wish they'd stay open 24 hours like standard Steak N Shakes, but ah well. I don't mind the smaller menu, but I do mind that they do not have the peppers. They are missing some key elements that dispite the smaller menu they could do better.  I agree with a fellow reviewer that the milkshakes are not Steak N Shake quality. However, I'm willing to overlook all of that for my Frisco melt with fries and a side of cheese sauce.",

She seemed more preoccupied with texting on her cell phone than serving customers. I ordered a burger combo.   The burger had good flavor and was loaded. However the fries were very cold and skimpy. The drink machine was not working properly because the choices were either out or not serviceable. Overall the place could have been a bit more clean. The tables were dirty and not wiped down in some time.   Other customers next to us expressed they were not happy with the quality of food received. It seemed to set the tone overall of this particular place.   The prices seem reasonable but should be reflective of the product. On this occasion it was not. This is not what I would expect from Steak 'n Shake. Perhaps another location may be suggested.",

Once we got there, I realized that it was a stripped down version of what other \"Steak 'n Shake\" places have. I was completely fine with that, but after receiving my burger and fries, I realized they tasted as though they had been sitting on the counter for a couple minutes.  The Burger. -Cheese wasn't melted -Patty wasn't hot -Not a huge size  Fry's -Overcooked -Not Hot  +Ok taste +Multiple flavor drink machine :D +Friendly Staff  Maybe because this place is new here in Arizona, the staff isn't properly trained yet. Either way, I wouldn't go out of my way to visit this place. It's a pain to drive/park in Mill Ave just for an \"OK\" burger joint. If your on Mill, then I'd recommend another spot. There were no big negatives from this place, but nothing that made me want to spend the extra $$ above from a fast food spot.",

First off, i am from the midwest, but i have lived in Arizona most of my life, Steak 'n Shake is my FAVORITE place to eat back home, this location... i will NOT go again (maybe) It has none of the charms like the original, no host(ess), no bar to sit and watch them smash your burger and cook it, only about 50% of the menu, no server to take your order and refill your dr pepper, no sauces sitting out for your food drowning pleasure, and no physical menus you can hold while you decide which tasty burger or dessert you want.. what there is though, are giant tv screens, a touchscreen soda machine, annoying music, and an awkward patio.    where was i.. covered bad and ugly.. oh yeah, the royale was tasty because #iloveegg, and the frisco melt was great too.  But i can get that anywhere, the ambiance sucked.",

The decor is cute however the staff lags on cleaning up tables.  Speaking of the staff, the two guys were too busy slacking off while the cook was taking orders and making the meal.  Oh, and the banana milk shake tasted like tapioca pudding so clearly not real bananas.   We ordered 2 Signature steak burgers, which looked good but ended up more like Signature grease burgers on stale bread. The meal comes up with shoe string fries that were greasy, burnt, and when I got to 1/2 way in the box were more like the crumbs of french cries of fries, REALLY!  We ate 1/2 our meal and pitched it, not worth shitting on the potty the rest of the night.  Yes, that greasy!   I would suggest going to the chuck box down the street.  But hey, thanks for the wifi I posted this review with.",

    "text": "After letting the hype settle down, I decided to pay a visit to Steak 'n Shake today and was sadly disappointed. While the building and decor is somewhat nice, everything else left a lot to be desired.  The bullet points: -Steak burger was good if unremarkable. -Shake was good, though again unremarkable. -Ordered my food for dine-in, still came out in a paper bag as if I had asked for it to go.  But what is really troubling is how unclean the place feels. At ~3pm, the area between the soda machines was stained and dirty, and I don't recall seeing a single table wiped down in the half hour or so I was there. Mine certainly wasn't when I sat down, and none really seemed cleaner than another.  As has been touched on earlier, the employees seem to be the issue here, as they simply don't seem to get it. Yes, one greeted me when I walked in, but as far as keeping this relatively new place presentable, they didn't seem to get it.  Also, the dual buzzer system is confusing and somewhat annoying, though a relatively minor inconvenience. Why it's that way is beyond me; hopefully it is something gets addressed.  For my first and likely only visit to this Steak 'n Shake, I left less than impressed by this place that came with high expectations. Better to go around the corner to a locally owned institution and get a burger there.",

For anyone who's expecting a normal hometown experience, this 'Signature' Steak 'n Shake is not going to cut it. Imagine a Steak 'n Shake next to Terminal B36 at an Airport and this is what your walking into.  1. The menu - 1/3 the size at a normal Steak 'n Shake 2. The Steakburger and Milkshake - exactly as expected  3. The fries - come standard with this strange red spice (found out you can ask to have them plain)  I'm giving this 3 stars because of the emotional letdown. The staff was friendly, I received my order quickly and the food tasted normal except for the fries. My guess is Steak 'n Shake went with a 'Signature' option because the model generates more revenue than their traditional sit-down-and-be served locations. Well Steak 'n Shake, this may be True, but you wont be capturing my dollars again anytime soon.",

Most of you are familiar with SNS from the midwest, and while this is essentially the same, it's a different format. This is called Steak n Shake Signature, basically meaning it's a limited menu in a fast food style format for urban areas. Don't worry, this one still has all the staples: steakburgers, fries, shakes. It's just a little faster and more self serve, still that great Steak n Shake flavor you've come to love!

When he found out that Steak & Shake was opening he got so excited he wanted to just go stand outside and wait for it to open.   We had our date night on Mill this week and had dinner at the infamous S&S. It was very good! I got the burger with the guac on it, super yummy, just enough heat in the guac and the bun was perfectly toasted. The French fries were my favorite part of the meal by far. Super salty, crispy and tons of them. Way better than anyone else's in my opinion!   I also had the fresh banana and chocolate shake, fresh banana is the way to go. It was sooooo good and totally filling, I tried to finish it but almost burst.   Jon says it isn't like the one's back home, Michigan, but he was pleasantly surprised how close it was. We will be back for sure! Probably wont drive across town just for that again, but if we are in the area, we will make a slight detour.",

I ordered the Frisco Melt, which pleasantly reminded me of Jack in the Box's Sourdough Jack.  The bf ordered the Royale Burger, which is basically a cheeseburger with bacon and a fried egg.  Their fries are shoestring style, thin and crispy but nothing to write grandma about.  The burgers we had... were just burgers.  I will say this though, if you ever hear someone say \"You can't eff up a burger\" - that person is wrong.  You CAN eff up a burger.  This place though, did not.  It just wasn't out of this world.    Oh, I'm also a fiend for anything banana flavored.  Espesh banana shakes.  I ordered one from here and was sort of disappointed.  As banana-ey and flavorful as it was, it tasted too artificially sweet, in which I'm pretty sure they use artificial flavoring...  I've had better ( Joe's Farm Grill's banana shake is out of this world).  I'm just saying, if one of your specialties are shakes, then you should make 'em so that you ARE known for them.    In general, the prices are right ( about 5 bucks for a meal) and the flavor's aren't bad.  I would return if I were hungry and in the area.  It's not something I would repeatedly crave though.",

    "text": "2 stars because of the shake quality and one employee was going around cleaning tables and the floors.   Now this is how my 2nd experience at this \"Stake n Shake\" went. The quotes because it barely deserves the name stake n shake. Now before I took the time to drive 21 minutes to this so called establishment, I called them to ask if it was possible to not have a lot of salt on my fries and if they could be less done. The lady said, \"yes we can do that.\" Now I'm not super trusting of fast food employees in a college town. So I asked, \"are you sure because it will be a 20 minute drive to get there and there are a lot of bad reviews and I don't want to be disappointed.\" She assured me that it was possible so I drove over and paid the meter.   When I walked inside the first thing I saw was 2 rugged looking people with dirty hair and paint covered dirty pants by the door. One sitting on the floor leaning on his big bag. I think they were homeless. I didn't smell anything though so maybe they just were idk but they looked very homeless. Then I went to order.   When I ordered I asked for a big strawberry shake which turns out to just be a regular and a big fry which was a large. I asked for the fries to not have a lot of salt and for them to be less cooked. I also asked for cheese on the side. The chick said okay and gave me a pager thing.   *the only reason I got just fries and a shake is because they don't have chicken tenders which is what I get at every other stake n shake with a side of honey mustard*  I waited about 5 minutes and got my food. The fries were just like everyone else's except with little salt. They were over done and okay. Not the best. The cheese is tiny and the fries are huge. And it costs $0.53 to get another tiny side of cheese. I felt robbed. Now the shake was good. It tasted like the shakes back home and like the ones at every other stake n shake I have been to in my life.   When I was done eating this food I looked for napkins. There were no napkins on the tables or by the soda area where you get the straws and stuff. I finally found a single napkin holder under the wine holder to the far left of the counter. That's sad. This second chance for this place was wasted. I regret going here and will never do so again.  TLDR: NOT THE REAL DEAL! No chicken tenders, over done fries, and a waste of time.",

    "text": "Rename it Steak 'n Shame, because this is a Steak 'n Shake in name only! The name is reminiscent of my youth back in St. Louis, where Steak 'n Shake meant the most delicious steak burgers, awesome cheese fries, chili mac, and mouth watering shakes and malts, topped off with exceptional friendly service.   This place is wholly lacking in all of the above. If you are coming here thinking you are getting Steak 'n Shake, I can guarantee you will leave disappointed. The food doesn't taste anything close to the real deal, many of the staples like the chili mac are on not the menu, and even the shakes don't quite taste like a Steak 'n Shake should. I was happy to find the Frisco Melt on this condensed menu, but it tasted only marginally like a Steak 'n Shake Frisco Melt. My guess is the folks running this location have never experienced a True Steak 'n Shake, so food flavor and consistency is right out the window. Everything honestly tasted like it comes from an entirely different restaurant.  This was a tough review for me, because I wanted so desperately to love this place, but it's inauthentic.  I can only blame the company for allowing a phony quick-stop version of their brand to be out there diminishing what is otherwise one of my favorite places to eat. Service may be quick, but it's not friendly. In spite of the restaurant's cramped size, it's been dirty the couple of times I've visited, while the employees mill around in a poor attempt to appear busy.  Heaven forbid anyone decides to open a pale version of White Castle out here just to try cashing in on the name and reputation. This Steak 'n Shake isn't worth the trip to ASU.",

We would save and splurge on a trip to Steak N'Shake where we would chow down on a burger each, a shake and large order of fries yo share.  We moved home yo Arizona but always missed the steak burgers and the amazing shoestring fries.  Then we heard that a Steak N'Shake had opened in Arizona!  OMG we were excited.  We planned a big date night out and got some burgers to start.  The steakburgers are as good as we remembered them as were the shakes.  The shoestrings were good but the portion so small we could no longer split an order but had to get one each.  It definitely took us back to our early married days in Indiana!",

I got the peppercorn bacon burger and fries with a soft drink. While I found a burger to be tasty, the fries were dark and greasy, seems like the oil needed to be changed a week ago. We were nearly late for the conference considering the wait time, I had just under 10 minutes to down my food before walking to the conference. This is lunch time folks, this is fast food, people need to eat and go. Such a disappointment, I will not return to this location.",

The Royale was on the lower end at $5.50 which is a very reasonable price for a tasty, filling burger + fries.  The shakes are good, not my favorite shakes around but worth a try.

We came in about 2:30 for a couple of shakes. One couple was in there, and they were already eating,  so obviously they no longer needed to be helped. The only person besides us that was placing an order was a guy ordering a burger. We were given a pager. This was the first time in my life that I've been given a pager to wait on shakes. We went to a table and sat down to wait. And wait. And wait! I looked at my receipt, and it had now been 10 minutes since our order was placed. I looked over at the 3 employees on duty behind the counter, and none of them gave any hints that they were working on making them. My husband went up to inquire about why it was taking so long. The girl explained that they were just \"so busy\". My husband gestured around himself at all of the empty chairs and said, \"Yeah, I see how busy it is in here!\" At that point, they decided to make our shakes, probably to get us off of their case. Another thing I should mention is that it appeared that every table was dirty, as well as the seats, floors, and the condiment area. Overall, a super disappointing experience. Thank goodness we live in Florida where we can have our shakes within a minute or two after ordering.",

Let's be honest, a lot of AZ and Cali natives don't know a good hamburger when they see one and hop onto the new hype easily, no offence! I'm from Chicago and we are all about keeping good food and service around in the Midwest!  I used to eat at SnS in Illinois pretty often, I liked that it was sit down and diner style. Kind of disturbed at this new trend of making nice quaint restaurants into impersonal fast food shacks. I had a plain burger and fries and my friend had some toppings on the burger with fries and a shake. I was kind of shocked at how mediocre the shake was, really disheartening. The burger seemed slightly undercooked and the bun was cold and soft/mushy... fries were average, not what I remember! They messed up our order 2x times and had to wait over 30min to get it right, thank goodness we had time or I be really p-oed. Actually found out they had forgotten about us as well (idk how that happens!).  I finished the burger cause I was starving by then but I couldn't finish the fries and that never happens! Ouch. Oh and by the way, it is most certainly NOT* the \"In n Out of the Midwest\". I like I-n-O alright but the actual SnS in the Midwest is a much higher supreme creation.",

After i sat down i saw a few people walk in and use the bathroom without even paying for anything and they weren't  even told anything  at all which got me pretty  upset . I work fast food and have  never seen a place this bad and the ketchup machine really needs updating i almost broke it due to lack of patience with this business first time and never coming back again. I recommend rally's  instead of this place anyday even Rallys  worst service is better  then this and their food actually has flavor",

I didn't want to leave a negative review so didn't leave a review at all when we found out this location had a limited menu, loud annoying music and the parking is awful.  The food had been good and hey, it was a SNS in Arizona which we have wanted for years as everyone loves SNS.  Well the past three times we have been in were awful.  Last time the service was bad, the place was dirty and they messed up our order.  We went in yesterday and once again they messed up our order, we didn't get our shakes until we were done eating - they no longer have any of the shakes I like and the french fries were so covered in salt that I couldn't eat them and had to throw them away.  When this location first opened we were here every week (driving 30 minutes or so to get here) and the staff was good.  Now everyone is new, not many employees have been staying and our orders are wrong.  So sad to leave a negative review for SNS!  If you are ever in another state though you need to try them out as every other location is great!",

He let me try it and it was really good so after my meal I went back and ordered that same shake for myself and it was $3.55 for the small which is the same one as he got. It is around 7:40 and we are the only ones in the store, so after 20-25 min of waiting my friend and I go up to ask and the man says \"Oh I looked over there (by the register) and couldn't find you\". I hold up my buzzer that they gave me and said \"well you could've buzzed me or just saw us over there we are the only ones here\". So he brought out my partially melted and small shake and said \"don't worry about it man\". This wasn't him refunding me it was implying blame on me. I argued the size of my shake because my friend got a bigger one and he ordered small too. They said no and I was left with my gross melted small shake for $3.55 and I was in a rush so I didn't want to deal with this. Very disappointing because I use to go there a lot but I'll just go to a different burger place on Mill now",

    "text": "i've seen a lot of reviews posted so far that knock the fact you can't get the full menu. fair enough, its a busy location and they want to keep things moving quickly. i can dig it. but here's the real problem with this steak & shake - well, its just kinda sucky.  First off, the \"experience\" is nothing like what you get at a normal steak & shake. this steak & shake makes me think more of what it would be like if you traveled through time to 2064 and visited a \"retro\" Steak & Shake, where everything is high-gloss plastic and frosted glass. the benches are plain white fiberglass plastic stuff with no cushion, fairly uncomfortable to sit in for more than 15 minutes. the ordering system is that type where you walk in, some creepy grinning schuckster is there to take your order and repeatedly tell you \"its just like a regular steak & shake, but not\"... there's no friendly wait staff, there's no grill men you can watch from your seat making  your meal.   I ordered a chocolate milkshake - YUCK. one of the things that you come to expect from a place called Steak and SHAKE is a real milkshake. you know, made from milk and ice cream. this was clearly some kind of bag formula that had ice added since there were nice big chunks of it in the milkshake. at least it had real whip cream on top.  the girlfriend ordered a frisco patty melt thing... which was pretty weak too. two pieces of sourdough, frisco sauce and two patties. wow. i told her after leaving, \"you can tell your friends you still havent had steak & shake cuz this doesnt count\"  Really, this feels more to me like a cash grab trying to play off midwest nostalgia since most of illinois is relocating to arizona.  think of this steak & shake as like when you go to guatemala and visit mcDonalds. its kinda the same, but not really. while we were eating, a family visting from the midwest sat down next to us. \"well, what do you think, son?\" (clearly asking what he thought of the ASU campus area)  \"well, steak & shake is nice, but there's a lot of weirdos around\"... so yeah, think of it as a kinda-sorta-not-quite taste of home when the mean streets of tempe arizona get you down.",

Sorry, I'll pass this one up from now on and go to Freddy's - its more like the original SNS.

Since I am 38 weeks PREGNANT, I really needed a bathroom when I got as far as Steak n Shake. They have a public restroom, and it was 2 minutes before close. I was in pain, and in tears, when they told me, they were closing and I could not use their public restroom. Even though, the door was still unlocked and customers were still inside eating. I pleaded with the employee and he said since I was not a customer, I could not use their restroom, and they were too close to closing for me to just buy something to use their restroom. When I went to the closed restaurant next door, they were happy to assist me. Shame on you Steak n Shake. Awful people you have working there.

When I left I wish I had just got to Fatburger on Mill, last weekend I went to Chuckbox and was glad I did.   Even Five Guys which I am not a fan is 10x times better than the Signature Burger from Steak N Steak.    First start with the positive,  the place was clean and well lit.   Next the ordering went smooth but the staff didn't seem to know much about the burgers.    First they give you everything in a bag making it hard to eat for someone eating in the place,  second my burger was drowning in ketchup.    The fries were cold,  I had to ask for new fries.    The shake was okay, I tried a different flavor but it was not thick enough maybe even watery at times.     The restaurant was not that busy,  but enough people were there around 10:30pm on a Saturday night.    This Kerstin chick must work for the restaurant,   if they can't afford to open Steak N Steak's the right way shouldn't give us a half-attempted location.   I probably will never eat there again, if ever in the Midwest  I will look for a Culver's or Freddy's Steakburger.    This half attempt has lost me as a customer for a lifetime.   I wish all businesses good luck but I wish an In-N-Out burger would open instead.    Save your money and go to a real burger joint.",

    "text": "Finally...a Steak 'n Shake in AZ. Having grown up in the Midwest I've definitely missed them. Unfortunately I'm still waiting for one.   Before coming here I did my research and know the difference between full and signature versions. Yet I'm still giving it a poor review, after 3 trips here now.   Trip 1 - Monday lunch. Waited in line for 15 mins. Waited for food for 10 mins, which was good because it took 5 mins of waiting for a table to sit at. BBQ burger was ok.  Trip 2 - Thursday lunch. Waited in line for 15 mins again. Waited another 25 mins for food!   Took 10 mins this time to get a table. They forgot to put the lettuce on the burger. Was good tasting but not great. Got to sit and listen to guy arguing with manager.  He said the cheese in his burger was still frozen. She said they don't heat it up and he said he understood that but this was actually frozen, not cold. She offered to make him another one but he didn't hVe time since the wait had used up his lunch break. She didn't offer him a refund but instead took his name so next time he comes in they can give him something. Not good customer service.   Trip 3 - Sunday lunch. Line wait was 5 mins. Pretty quick. Choice of tables since restaurant was less than half full. Shake wait was 2 mins, and food wait was another 5 mins. Definitely faster.  Food was a little worse than previous trips. BBQ burger was smothered in sauce with very little onion strings so it was hard to eat.   Overall Not pleasant experiences.  Music is constantly too loud. People next to us were complaining as well since you have to practically yell to talk to each other.  Wait times during normal lunch times is way too long. I've never waited that long at a full steak and shake and it should be much faster here.  Single size drink sucks. Give us multiple sizes to choose from.  Garbage can opening are barely large enough for the tray to fit in to let alone flip them to empty the garbage.  Seating area wayyyyyy to small.  Food is definitely not the quality of a True steak and shake. If your not going to be one, don't use the name.   Hope this review helps  - still waiting for a steak and shake in AZ",

    "text": "I'm going to concur with the other Midwesterner's review of this SNS. It's sort of an oasis in a land of unfamiliarity. It's also not your typical SNS. If you've ever been to the Midwest, you know these joints are all over the place like most other chain restaurants and with some the same pros and cons. If you're some sort of hamburger aficionado then let's face it, you're better off going to one of your $30 a plate, high falluting snobby restaurants to get a 5 star burger. SNS is probably 3.5 at best but I personally believe they're a cut above the other chains simply because they use actual steak and cook it right there in front for everyone to see, not to mention they've kept the processes the same since the first one opened in Normal, IL (ironically, where I attended college). This one is a bit different. The menu is SERIOUSLY stripped down. As in, two burgers to choose from, a sandwich and some hot dogs. They still have shakes, but not the side-by-side I've grown accustomed to. And as a final con, this one didn't have the table top seasonings for fries or the hot pepper juice you can shake on your food like all the others do. And those are honestly my only complaints about this place, otherwise I'd say it's the best one I've been to, and here's why. The decor of all the other SNS's I've been to is exactly the same at every one, very diner-ish and really boring. This place is a lot more modern and with outdoor seating. The very first SNSs back in 1956 served fried chicken and beer. This one at least serves beer, along with a few different wines. And finally, the service was spot on. The girl who took our order was pretty outgoing and admitted when she messed up. I got the last of the Dos Equis keg so got a half a beer but then they brought me out another one for free because of it. I'll probably come back here again with that kind of service.",

To be fair though the burger is good but it's not a real Steak and Shake burger, it's more of an in and out/ freddys merged burger, but it is good. My biggest gripe is the fact that the menu is lack luster at best and that red drink machine is not going to cut it. I sound bitter because I am, if you are going to bring a steak and shake here you should have done it right.",

    "text": "Unless you're a poor college student I recommend staying away from here (in fact, just stay away from Tempe in general).    The place is fairly clean, kind of small, and the tables are slightly too large for the space.  I ordered and the cashier acted like it was my fault she had to work there, totally rude.  The buzzer system was really annoying.  It would ring when one thing was ready, then you had to wait again for next part, then again, again...  With all the people working there you think they would be able to get the whole order ready, and then bring it to you.  The food was average to below average.  I tried the original burger; it had a double patty, cheese and the usually toppings and came with fries.  The burger was under seasoned and had no flavor.  The fries tasted old, and I asked for plain fries but there were nasty vinegar and cheese ones mixed in.  Overall, I give this place a thumbs down.  If you want a good fast food burger I recommend Five Guys or Lenny's.",

    "text": "I was out and about and figured I eat the way the college kids do, so I headed down Mill. I had seen Jimmy Johns and Five Guys (which I never tried) across the street. Just before crossing the street I looked behind me to see 'Steak N Shake' and after hearing my out of state friends rave about it I jumped at the chance. Ill admit feeling like that awkward newbie I liked the limited menu but do wish the staff was a bit more ready for an idiot like me who has no idea, I mean its not McDonald's and didn't have any idea what was on the menu till I was staring the cashier in the face. So I order the item with the biggest picture on the menu with a large drink, turns out all drinks are one size, small. She takes my money then hands me my change (price was reasonable) along with my tiny cup and one those vibrating coaster deals. I sit down and finish my drink right away, I ended up refilling it three times before my order was ready, it was 117 outside, I also have to say the seating arrangement is very awkward for a loner but I was there for food. I liked the fries even if I wished there was more, the \"original\" was decent, bun was soggy but did have crisp veggies so I appreciated that. I ate there yesterday and didn't find out till now all the menu items they were lacking from a standard Steak N Shake. Knowing what I know now I should continued across the street to Jimmy Johns or Five Guys, hell if given the option id rather have had a double double or even a Big Mac. I don't have the option to get out very often and even less opportunity to experiment but this time id say I made the wrong choice :(",

I tried the cake batter shake and was disappointed I had ordered the small size because it was so delicious that I wanted more.  This is a stellar option for a quick service burger.

    "text": "Well, being from the MidWest, I was super excited, on our cross-country road trip (two summers ago) to introduce my own family to SnS.  It did not disappoint and we had SnS atleast 4 times during the 3 week outing.  The following year (last year) when we repeated that trip, we were sure to stop by SnS (kids were practically begging).  On that trip, we even asked them when they might bring one our way.  Little did I know that they had already planned it.  When I told my kids that Steak 'n Shake would, indeed, open a restaurant in the valley, they couldn't wait.  Well, after discovering that it was already opened, my wife and I ventured out to the SnS Signature restaurant to enjoy some great fast food.  I read the reviews on Yelp (prior to heading out) and prepared her for the reality that the experience would not be like we were used to.  Having said that, we pleased with the food we received.  I ordered the Original and my wife had the Western BBQ & Bacon.  The food was received promptly, and was delicious.  My only comment (as it relates to the food) would be a lack of consistency in the fries.  Because they are cut so thin (shoestring) they varied from very crispy (almost burnt) to something more palatable.  The service was great (on par with what you might expect to find in other \"counter-service\" restaurants.  It definitely was not the Steak 'n Shake experience that we were used to, but given the choice between not having a local SnS and having to drive several hours to get the full SnS menu / experience, I think SnS Signature is an acceptable alternative (for now).  I do, however, echo the sentiments of others requesting that SnS bring the full diner experience to AZ.",

So my son and I were very excited to spot one while we were driving down Mill Avenue today.  This is definitely different than any location I have visited in the past.  We found the resturant uncrowded and fairly clean.  Ordering was unique with a computer ordering system that you had to pay by credit card (I didn't see an option to use cash or even google wallet).  The menu is definitely limited, but they have burgers, fries with options, and a limited shake menu.  We received our food, made fresh, in a resonable amount of time.  It was prepared properly and tasted decent.  We didn't eat our food there, so I am not sure if the fries would have been crispy if we had eaten them immediately, but they were limp and soggy.  Bottom line, I wouldn't make a special trip to go there but if I were on Mill I might give it another try.  But with Chuckbox so close it's a hard sell.",

We told him it was our first time and he walked us through the menu and made recommendations. After ringing us up, he personally went back, fired up the grill (we were the only customers at the time), and made our burgers. I got the royale and my wife got the portobello.  Order came our quick. Patties were cooked perfectly. Burgers were great, but he forgot the egg on mine, which I noticed after the first bite. I left him know and he genuinely apologized. I could tell he felt terrible. He told me to enjoy my burger as is and he'd make me a totally new one. I did just that. Both burgers were phenomenal and so were the shakes. We were also surprised that the burgers came with fried given the cost.  I guess these days I don't expect customer service at \"fast food\" restaurants. I was pleasantly surprised.

I had already read the mostly negative reviews, but decided to give it a shot anyways. First of all, service is great. The female employee who took our order graciously accepted our coupons and got our order correct. It wasn't busy, so we didn't have to wait long for our meal. The facilities were as dirty as you'd expect any burger diner joint to be.  Cheeseburgers: the bun is low quality, cold and dry. The steak patties were tasty enough but dripping with way too much grease and oil. Parmesan herb fries: half of it was hard and burnt; maybe we should have just ordered regular? Red velvet shakes: nothing special but not bad, and not many oreo pieces inside.  Overall, I am glad that we tried this place, but I have to say that we could have had a similar but better experience at a Freddy's.  Maybe if we do visit again we'll try ordering some other items and see if our opinions change.",

We ordered burgers and fries, and 2 of our 4 orders came out wrong. When given our actual food, the burgers had no real flavor. The fries were too crispy and left a burnt aftertaste. One of us waited 15 minutes for just an order of fries because they had given it to someone else and didn't realize it until we told them we never received our order.

    "text": "The burgers are tasty, with fresh ingredients. The shakes here are decent, and a good deal for the price. The atmosphere though... well... that's another story. I've been to several Steak 'n Shakes in the Midwest, and this one is more like a \"Steak 'n Shake Express.\" I guess that's what makes this \"Steak 'n Shake Signature\" restaurant different, but in ways that make me miss the original versions of the chain. This isn't a diner- it's more like eating at an In N Out or a Fatburger. There's just a small seating area, you order and pick up at the counter, and it is not open 24/7. The menu is very limited as well, with less to offer than the diner versions.  The general feel of the place is more modern, and more hip. Top 40 music plays on the speakers, the interior and even the font signage out front has a contemporary feel. They even have one of the new Coke soda fountains that allow you to pick various flavor combinations. Back when I used to live in the Midwest, I had many memories of having late night eats at various Steak 'n Shakes with friends, indulging in greasy burgers and fries on white plates, and lusciously thick shakes in glass milkshake cups. Eating at this Steak 'n Shake makes me long for the actual diner, although the food itself still tastes the same. For me, some of that magic is lost for this particular restaurant when I am eating in a small area with a large crowd of people, getting my order at the counter, and eating my burger, fries, and shake in a fast-food type manner.  We went here on a Sunday around noon. We got in before the big rush, since a few minutes after we ordered, there was a line out the door, winding around the block! Our order took maybe 10-15 minutes to be made, and seating was limited.   I ordered the Royale, partially because it conjured images of Samuel L. Jackson talking about a Royale with Cheese in Pulp Fiction, and partially because the addition of bacon and egg to a burger sounded delicious. The order came with fries, and I also had some of a banana milkshake. The Royale was indeed delicious, with juicy, flavorful ground beef, fresh tomato, crisp lettuce (Green leaf, not the cheapo iceberg lettuce!), melted cheese, a smoky salty flavor from the bacon, and a nice rich, creamy texture and taste from the fried egg. The bun was soft and held up well with the other ingredients. The shake was OK. It tasted more like imitation banana flavored syrup rather than fresh banana mixed in with ice cream, but at $3, hey what do I expect?  The fries were thin, and slightly crispy. They were decent, but the real star of the meal was the burger.   I will be waiting the day that perhaps a full service Steak 'n Shake can open in the Phoenix area. Until then, this express version will have to do!",

There was trash on the floors, sticky stuff on tables and floors, the bathrooms had dust on the soap dispenser (how long has it been since you cleaned that) and the stains on walls and floors meant mopping was a while before. It's a little nauseating to see that after we ate. Won't be considered back unless I'm looking for food poisoning.",

Although their burgers are pretty good, I probably won't be coming here too often by myself. My friends love this place already and have eaten here several times this week. However, it is a little pricey for my taste.  I do have to say the burgers tasted fresh. If I rank In N Out first place on taste, I probably give SNS second place. haha.  Also... you can't buy the burger by itself. You get fries with it and that ups the cost. What if I don't want fries? And the burgers are fatty and greasy. I'm sticking with the protein style at In N Out. Less fat, less money. Equally tasty!",

Soda spilled all over the floor which means super sticky floors. You're lucky if you can find a clean table. Everything I mean EVERYTHING in this burger joint needs a major deep cleaning.

The skinny Back story Before I decided to purchase vehicle I used to ride the light rail home mon-fri I would travel east on university exit mill ave and walk to light rail station. I one day saw the sign for a steak and shake I def got excited as I have heard of this chain from family and friends in Illinois and as a lover of shakes. They had a great prices a good size burger and fries for 4$ the burger is def a greasy bastard but what do u expect from a burger. Taste wise was ok no real distinct seasoning on it pretty bland but it was ok. The fries are great the first time they were pretty salty but they have since gotten better the only problem is they have a lot of crumbs and fries edges. The milkshake tastes like leaving ice cream with out a lid in freezer and it getting that freezer burn taste, everytime I go back I just skip the shake but I may give it another shot soon. Service is great and fast parking can and usually is a nightmare.  This place deserves more of a 2 1/2 stars instead of 3 but they are def not a 2 I have had worse burgers and for the price I'm not complaining I have gone back a few times pretty much cause they gave me and my girl a free burger on our birthday which she gave to me :-) score!! I will still go back cause I do love the cheese fries just hook up more fries please.",

I tried a bite and I definitely think it was worth the $5 we paid... plus it came with fries. The shake was pretty good...nothing too special but was a lot larger than we were expecting.

That was a mistake. To strong! Wish I would have went with regular fries. Still like 5 guys and in and out fries better. The burger was good. Very juicy, bun was yummy.

    "text": "Having grown up in the midwest, I'd played up Steak 'n Shake to AZ friends for years...  Well, I had to eat some crow after my burger, LOL.     If you're expecting the Steak 'n Shake of old  (both food and experience-wise), you're going to be disappointed. Great location. Great people watching from the patio (which was dirty). This location is a stripped down menu version. Burgers, shakes, fries, hot dogs... No Chili-Mac, etc, etc...  The well toasted buns and thin edge burgers have turned into a bit of an average, slightly mushy, OK tasting burger. The fries are still great. Had this been a blind taste test, I'd have never guess Steak 'n Shake (and I spent 20 years of my life eating there).    In short, decent food for a decent price on Mill...  If you want food that tastes like Steak 'n Shake used to, go eat at a \"Freddy's\".",

I asked the server for a recommendation. He said the signature burger is the best flavor, he even gets it with no cheese. And the flavored fries: Parmesan garlic or sea salt and pepper are both great.   I got my food and tasted the burger. The patty was flavorful, juicy and crispy on the outside. The toppings a great addition.   They fries were strong but very tasty. I want to try all the flavors.   The manager came by to check on the taste and cleared our trays for us after we finished.",

    "text": "So for all the years I had to hear how great this place is from family and business friends I finally went down to check it out.  Go for the shakes, don't go for anything else.  I know this is nothing like the ones east of Arizona but they really need to tell people that the amazing menu online is nothing like what you see when you come to this Mill Ave location. This limited menu is a dissappointment compared to the real Steal N Shakes.  As for the service ALOT of bad things going on down there as other reviews have stated. The trash cans are just plain stupid. The fact that the employees don't care about their jobs show and the amazingly stupid 2 buzzer system means this place will close in time. I watched everyone get their drinks in 5-10 minutes then wait 10-20 minutes to get their food.   The shakes are great. The one thing they got right. The burgers and fries ? Um why ? The fries are greasy the burgers are tasteless.  Overall  would only go back for the shakes and then would walk down to Jack in the Box for burgers that are better.  They need to re-think this location and would be better off opening a full steak n shake with a driv-thru and full menu plus get a staff that cares about their jobs.",

The shakes were also just ok. For the price I also expected better. It's not horrible, but it is definitely not the first place I'd go for a burger.   Also the service isn't excellent. I think it's kind of weird how all the girls have red lipstick, and nails. The tables outside are also dirty a lot of the time and the workers are not always friendly and helpful with the menu.

    "text": "Eek!  Steak 'n Shake, famous in such places as... Ohio... has made it to Mill Avenue.  My daughter, after a particularly amazing play date, was really exhausted when she leaned against the car window and saw this place out of the corner of her eye.  \"Shakes, Mom?\" More a demand than a question, but hey.    Anyway, I caved in easily and we parked and made our way inside.  There was a line of about five people in front of us.    She ordered a kids' meal with a Mint shake and I ordered whatever their special was.    This fast food joint has NOT found its groove yet.  After waiting more than twenty minutes after ordering, we were buzzed to the counter to get her shake.  More than forty minutes after ordering, we were called up to get our food.  When I looked in the bag, I noticed her grilled cheese sandwich looked a lot like a plain hamburger.  Perhaps fine for other kiddos, but not for my beef-hating child.    I brought it back up to the counter and she told me she would remake it.  I asked how long it would be and she said \"on the fly,\" whatever that means.  2 stars for that gal.    So we waited another ten minutes and an employee (perhaps a manager) was walking by to ask how we were liking everything.  I told him we did not get our sandwich yet because it was made incorrectly.  He immediately went up and checked on it.  We got our sandwich two minutes later.  5 stars for this guy.    1.) It took too long.  1 star. 2.) The kid was full by the time her food arrived because she had consumed her entire shake during the wait (which was good because it would have melted otherwise).  5 stars for the mint shake, according to kiddo. 3.) There was a minor price difference of maybe 10 or 20 cents in the restaurant's favor.  You'd think that the restaurant would have at least OFFERED to give it back to us.  I wouldn't have refused it.  My kiddo does have a piggy bank, after all. 4.) Did I mention it too way too long? 1 star.  We won't be back to this location until they smooth out their kinks... even though their parmesan herb fries were delish.",

However, the place was very clean, they served it incredibly fast (our wait time at most was 10 minutes), and service was very friendly!  I would say the fries were even better than the burger. However, since a lot of reviews say that the milkshakes are great, I'll have to come back to try those and I'll even order a different burger to give it a second chance, maybe that Guacamole Burger, because you can't go wrong with guacamole and chipotle mayo.  Also, I love that they are opened until 3am. So it expands your options of what you can eat after a night out.",

The place was clean, the staff was nice and the price was very reasonable. It's fast and good.",

I understand that this may have been a lot to handle given that there were only 2 employees on duty. They asked us to place our order at the kiosk so they could both work on making the food. That was fine with us, but the kiosk did not work well at all. I don't know if it timed out or what, but it kept cancelling the order half way through and returning to the start screen. It took us about 4 or 5 tries to get our order in AND while we were using the kiosk, they began helping other customers at the normal registers. While we were ordering we also began to notice one of the employees giving us all death looks and glares while shaking his head. I confirmed with the rest of my group and we all noticed it consistently while we ordered. We even saw the manager do it once. This was obviously uncomfortable and upsetting. We were paying customers and we were perfectly polite. A long while later, after we finished our shakes, we decided to take a group photo at the table. We noticed while taking the photo, that the same grumpy employee was standing nearby twirling his rag and rolling his eyes at us. Basically just making it obvious that he wanted us out of there so he could wipe down our two tables. I'm annoyed and upset with the service.",

Service was slow and they did mess up my boyfriend's order (forgot some sauce or other) but were quick to remedy that. They had not refilled the ketchup and overall it was an okay dining experience, but not like the Steak'n Shakes you may be used to. Either way, this location will probably be a cash cow for its proximity to the university.",

Fries come with the burgers which was a nice surprise.  The negative:  There is no parking, just metered street parking if you can find it, since it is in a college district.    Also, this is a VERY small version of a Steak 'N Shake, so I feel that it shouldn't be called just \"Steak 'N Shake\" but perhaps \"Steak 'N Shake Express\" or something to let people know what to expect.  There were only a few burgers, hot dogs, and shakes, ... no where near a Steak 'N Shake's full menu.  This was disappointing since my husband was really looking forward to the chili 5 way and I the peanut butter banana milkshake.  :-(   Here's hoping they will put a full Steak 'N Shake in somewhere near here.  All in all, if you've never been to a real Steak 'N Shake, this is worth a try since the food is still good, there just isn't a lot of variety.",

So of course I did this! And it was absolutely flipping delicious. Usually substitutions and additions will cost you more, but they were willing to give me some wiggle room on the price and give me the best of both worlds- in reference to the sandwich, if i remember correctly It was a burger on toast with bacon and an egg and some different cheeses and it was biblical. I would pray to that burger. What really impressed me was how patient and helpful the staff was to someone who needed some extra attention to have a good experience. I know I'm not the easiest customer to deal with all the time, so when I'm taken care of, I take note and appreciate it. Many business lack this kind of professionalism, but not this place! And it's on Mill Ave! I couldn't work on mill ave and maintain composure like these guys, I have a low tolerance for college crowds and  public inebriation. Just enough tolerance to go to steak n shake, eat a delicious meal, and go back home. Stay strong, steak n shake workers, stay strong. I love you.",

If you're familiar with this chain and have come to love it as much as I have because of other locations- this spot will make you upset. Also I'm a firm believer employees should be well groomed. It's gross to see questionable material under long fingernails.  I couldn't find it in me to order anything because of how poorly managed this place is.

    "text": "DO NOT GIVE YOUR BUSINESS  We were on vacation and had stopped in Mesa for the night on June 21st, we placed an online order around 11:30PM and my husband went to pick up the order, only to find a handwritten sign saying that the store had summer hours and closed at 10PM. I wondered why my order went through if it was closed. I decided there was nothing that I could do about it that night and we got other food. A few days later, the charge posted to my account so I called the store to speak with the manager. The manager called me back the next day because he was off the day I called. He told me that I would receive my refund in 5-7 days. I never received my refund. I called the store 3 days ago on JULY 16th, the person that answered the phone was rude, I asked to speak with the manager and she said he was in a meeting and I needed to call back, I told her I refused to call back and she needed to get him on the phone, she put someone else on the phone and then told the person she put on the phone to just hang up on me. I immediately called back and the store manager finally came on the phone and was extremely rude to me, telling me he never said the refund would go back on my card and that I needed to go into the store. I asked for a district manager's number and he gave me a number to a store in Illinois. I have reported to corporate twice and have still had no resolution, so I am here to warn everyone, do not give this store your business until the entire staff is fired and replaced with employees who care about their job as well as their customers.",

You place your order and take your pager, I'm not fond of that simply because I'm a germaphobe, grab your drink, they buzz you and you pick up your order.  The hamburgers were prepared well and served very hot. They have the best fries also, thin, shoestring type.  The layout was different from other Steak n Shakes I'd been in but it was clean and they were friendly and helpful.  We got lucky with the parking but I can see where it might be a total crapshoot to find any nearby parking.   I have a feeling I'll be back.

I didn't want to believe the bad reviews as I have good memories of Steak 'n Shake from going to college in the Midwest but apparently I should have.  First, lets talk about the food, it's good, but nothing special in this day and age of gourmet hamburgers everywhere you turn. I have a feeling my memories were biased by comparing these burgers to places like McDonald's, White Castle and Big Boy back in the 80's.  However, the biggest problem at this location is the way it is run.   I understand that we were there during the Tempe Festival of the Arts so I expect it to be busy, but I also expect that they will staff appropriately for the crowds and apparently that was too much to expect.   Even though there were four staff plus a manager working they told us that it would be a half-hour wait for our food. While it only turned out to be 15 minutes they were also apparently too busy to wipe down tables, refill the silverware bins, empty the overflowing trash cans, or clean the bathrooms while we were there. I'm not sure what the manager was doing, but maybe a field trip to In 'n Out Burger to see how you can handle crowds while still maintaining a neat and clean operation for the customers would be a good idea,  I'd go with one star, but at least it's cheaper than Shake Shack, so they have that going for them.",

    "text": "My BF and I hadn't had Steak n Shake for quite some time, and we occasionally deliver for Door dash at night from here so decided to order ourselves the other night. He was on his way home so I was hoping to call ahead the order, and have him pay cash upon arrival. I called the restaurant only to be told by the person who answered that he wasn't sure if he could take an order over the phone, and he had to put me on hold. After a few min of holding I put the call on speaker, and pulled up the online menu. 15 minutes later someone else (I will leave her name out but sounded like a manager) answered, like she was answering the call for the first time. I patiently and nicely told her how I had been waiting all this time to place an order. She yells to someone in the background \"you left someone on hold for 15 minutes?\" and his reply was \"oh, yeah, sorry.\" no biggie, I was perusing the menu again. Told I had to order online and by this time my BF was already outside, but I placed it anyhow so he wouldn't have to fuss with it. Online order wasn't received, so he was told I would have to call and cancel so he could place the order. It eventually came, but it was just a giant cluster f***. All for some frisco melts and cheese fries...but totally worth it. Except not. He gets home, and the order isn't correct...and missing a pertinent part of the whole reason for the visit...the cheese. I call back the person I was talking to before that seemed to kind of know what was going on, and again nicely asked to just be refunded if it was possible. The first words out of her mouth were \"the sauce is only 49 cents, but if you really need it refunded...\"and trailed off. That wasn't the point, but whatever. I told her no, I didn't realize the cheese was so inexpensive, so not necessary (I would have had to call online services anyhow, which would have been yet another giant cluster). So left that alone, thanked her and went on with my life. Sit down to finally eat, and there are 2 little black bugs crawling around in my orange Frisco melt sauce on the inside of my sandwich. Wouldn't have noticed but the first bug crawled out from in between the bread for a split second before I took a bite from it, then I opened the sandwich up to find another. I never expected the best service since this is smack dab in the middle of Mill Ave which is the center of college town hang out, so the location is incredibly busy and not the best condition. But this whole situation was just insane, and wouldn't have bothered with the post until the bugs got involved.",

Thought i had to because it had shake in the title so I needed to try them out! We waited about 20 min, not bad with how many people were there. We took food home since there was no where to sit.   The burger was AWESOME! Tasted fresh, bun was good and the toppings were great. The shake wasn't very good. It was icy and had really no taste.",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying that I was raised on Steak 'N Shake and am from where it originated. It's been a family institution for 8 decades. My parents frequented the original SnS. My grandparents frequented the original SnS & knew the Belt family. For all the Yelpers out there, I simply ask that, before you write off Steak 'N Shake based on a 'Signature' 1/2 store that is the Tempe location, please try eating at an actual sit-down classic Steak 'N Shake restaurant. The Signature store is NOTHING like the real deal. No exaggeration.   On to the review:  Finally tried Steak 'N Shake in Tempe today. Verdict: HIGHLY disappointed. Ordered original double cheese w/ fries. Zero crispy edges on slightly warm, mushy burger. ZERO CRISPY EDGES ON A STEAK 'N SHAKE ORIGINAL BURGER?? Crispy edges are a REQUIREMENT and WHOLLY DEFINE an original Steak N' Shake burger since 1934, goddammit. Limp tasting, overcooked fries. In-N-Out Burger is multitudes better than SnS Signature, and I don't even particularly like In-N-Out. A manager stopped by & asked how things were, and I just told him 'As a guy whose family is from Normal, Illinois, we've been eating @ Steak 'N Shake literally from day 1 - /for 80 years now/ & I wouldn't dream of bringing them to this location.' Everything was just 'off'. Not a single thing tastes or feels familiar about this 'Signature' location. It's really almost as if it's not even affiliated with the regular restaurants. The two friends I brought with me today said they'll never go back. I can't blame them. The /only/ thing going for this location is pricing. Contrast my Tempe experience with my most recent experiences at REAL SnS locations in Austin, TX last November & 2012 in Bloomington, IL: Pure joy. Everything was as it should've been.   I simply can't understand why they've chosen to roll these Signature stores out; it'd be almost as if In-N-Out Burger showed up in Peoria, IL & served ham salad sandwiches.   I think SnS is doing irreparable damage to their brand with these stores.",

This place is extremely dirty, can't sit anywhere. Ketchup and mustard on all the tables. No one working is cleaning at all, standing around. Took 20 minutes to get a double burger and fries when no one was in front of me in the line and the place is nearly empty. Then my food came out wrong. Never coming back here again, will be going to the 5 guys across the street.",

I ordered it via Uber eats and two hours after eating my burger I started becoming sick beyond belief. It was almost four days of being so sick that I almost had to go to the hospital. Luckily I was able to recover on my own, and I called just to let the manager know to watch out for their meat and hopefully prevent somebody else from getting sick and they did not even have the audacity to call me back. If you are a visitor in town for spring training, the Phoenix open, planning to move here or just a local like me take a pass on this place. It's not worth taking the risk of their uncooked burger meat.",

I am writing this for my daughter because she is disgusted with the feedback she has gotten from this establishment. Yesterday she went to steak and shake, she ordered A burger on the menu that included an egg, it was a late lunch and the only thing she had eaten yesterday, about 10 o'clock last night she got up vomiting and vomiting and vomiting, and at this point it's 4 o'clock in the morning and she is vomiting blood. I have had food poisoning one time in my life and I know that's what this was looking like. She needed to go to the ER but she was afraid of the cost, nor did she have insurance. She was so sick and dehydrated she had become delirious, so instead of going to the ER she called a mobile IV company and they sent out a nurse with a food poisoning IV. That cost her just over $200. She is feeling a little better now. She calls Steak N Shake and explains what happened and they tell her without any ER receipts and what not they wouldn't even consider listening to her case, and the mobile IV they just disregarded that. So my daughter starts looking at other reviews and she finds the one that you will see posted below. Please be careful if you go to this establishment, It doesn't sound like they are in compliance with the health codes, that is my next phone call. Please do not eat here because it was an absolute nightmare for her.",

This is not the Steak and Shake I remember, it was like stopping at a fast food place. The shakes are still creamy and delicious.

    "text": "Seriously unsatisfied. I have never written a Yelp review, however I felt inclined to discuss how mediocre this sad excuse for a Steak 'n Shake is. If you ever been to a REAL Steak 'n Shake then I urge you try anything else on Mill before you enter through those doors of disappointment. First problem, it's not a real Steak 'n Shake. Steak 'n Shake has hosts, waiters, and waitresses. This one does not have any of those things.  So your probably thinking, what's the big deal? Is that really why you hated it? Of course not, I could look past it as  I sink my teeth into a juicy Prince of Royal steak burger, however my pallet was not greeted with such a fine piece of culinary cuisine. (The prince of Royal has a fried egg on it and when asked if it could be done, I was told no. I should have walked out but I had to stick through it.) No, I was instead greeted with 1/4 of the menu which did not include this succulent burger. Honestly, It looked like an airport version of Steak 'n Shake with half the menu missing. Also, the burger was not that good and the fries were pretty terrible. Oh, and it's not 24hrs or even open late at all, again, a staple for what makes Steak 'n Shake so awesome.  Don't get me wrong, I love the steak n shakes of the Midwest so please, if you are in the Midwest and you pass a Steak 'n Shake, try it, you will love it's friendly staff, excellent food, and even better prices. I am so mad because my expectations were very high and I was sorely let down. P.S. - Went back to try a shake, those are great.",

    "text": "Here are some things you should know about the Steak and Shake on Mill Avenue:  This is not the Steak and Shake \"Classic store\" with the bow ties, the drive thru, the breakfast menu, and whatever you may be used to in the Midwest. This is a \"Signature store\", which means beer, wine, faster ticket times, and the prized posession: the Signature Steakburger.  Classics don't have the Signature , and it's a 6 oz patty and takes 4.5 minutes to cook, and has red onions instead of white. Otherwise it's the same as the Original Double, with (from top to bottom) ketchup, pickles, onions, patty, tomato and lettuce. At the time of this review, you can add bacon, grilled onion, Frisco sauce, mustard, or mayo to it.  Do not walk up to the cashier and ask for \"the steakburger\", saying that shows them you failed to correctly read the menu and will assume you mean the Signature, or ask you to clarify.  Not shown on the menu but can be ordered are the single steakburger (same dressings as double), junior steakburger (no dressings), junior grilled cheese, and regular grilled cheese. Junior orders have junior fries.  There are no meals/combos, but everything implicitly comes with fries (or a chili cup). You can say you don't want fries and that shaves off some of the cost. They don't have Steak and Shake Seasoning but do have others: Cajun, Parmasean Cheese and Herbs, Salt and Vinegar, and Sea Salt and Cracked Pepper. A small fry and a regular fry mean the same thing. And a large fry is huge.  There is only one size of drink, but 2 sizes of shake. A large shake and a regular shake mean the same thing, and are the same size as the drink cup.  They know that the menu sucks and is not as good as the Classic, but that is out of our control. There is a way to send feedback to Steak and Shake corporate, and that is where your voice will be heard, not on yelp.",

The waitresses have to wear black mini skirts with black boots (feel sorry for them in the summer)  You order at the counter, they give you a light up pager to pick up your food.  The organization of the counter is a little screwy because to get to the drink machine you have to cut through the line of people waiting to order.  The birgers are good, again very similar to In and Out burgers.  No complaints.  Fries are very skinny and taste better than most.  Milkshake was good (hard to mess up a chocolate milkshake) and this location has a really nice outdoor patio on Mill Ave so people watching is cool.  It is a good burger joint but competing with Five Guys, In and Out.  I can imagine going back there again but it isn't a top spot in my book.",

The burger was mediocre at best, the bottom bun was soggy, the fries were different that I remember and also cold, but I was majorly bummed that I couldn't get the pickle relish, the mgr said they did away with that years ago. Huh? The relish is one thing that makes SnS unique! And no chili-mac?! Sad. The ambiance was not typical, it was more hip and trendy, trying to cater to the ASU crowd I'm sure. Overall, I have to say it was not the visit I hoped for or expected. Just a thought: if you're going to bring SnS to the Valley, bring the WHOLE experience as is, don't try to tweak it to be something we already have enough of.",

I work with quite a few people from the east coast, who had been telling me nothing but good things about the Steak 'n Shake chain ever since we found out one was opening on Mill. Luckily, once doors opened at 11 the line moved through quite quickly and me and my equally hungry coworkers had a window to grab our long-awaited fast food before the next wave started around noon.  I ordered the Original (it being opening day and my first time at a Steak 'n Shake, I had to go with the signature) with fries and a Cookies and Cream milkshake (trust me, you'll want to order the milkshake). Within ten minutes, my burgers and fries were gone and I was onto the milkshake. Hey, I'd pretty much been hungry all morning and the panic about the line didn't hurt.  I'd say this is comparable to an In 'N Out, but with a slightly pricier menu and more selection. I'm sure opening day won't be anywhere close to the last time I order from here.",

    "text": "This place is GREAT! My boss took us here for lunch the second day they were open because it is his fave burger joint and since he moved from the Midwest, he hasn't been able to find one down here. I moved from MI so I can relate. Even though we went on the second day they were open and the place was a little packed, the service was fast AND friendly. I got the regular cheese burger and fries meal for $3.99 with a Mint Choco Chip shake that was to DIE for. There is nothing to say about the food other than you can't beat it. Burger Who? and forget McDonald's--I'll never ever eat there again! I have to be honest, I can't wait to go back.  We ordered four meals and two shakes all for under $30! You CAN'T BEAT THAT!  Great experience, great environment, great location (although parking leaves a little to be desired), and AMAZING FOOD! Go here. Order anything. You'll be happy!",

If you go in with the mind set that this is really a fast food joint, you won't be disappointed. Until you pay your bill.

Place was clean.  The Bad:  This is is what the $15/hour will look like.  While in most Steak and Shakes we have been in there are waitresses and such.  This place was run by 4 people.  It was set up like a McDonalds.  Daughter ordered Chili Cheese fries and the Chilie tasted like it was run through a sewer.  Burgers were smaller than usual.  I was a bit concerned as we took bites back for the dog and she hesitated in eating them and she eats just about everything.   We were thinking about taking the extended family here on one of our outings.  So glad we checked it out first. Won't be going back to this one ever.",

    "text": "I used to work next to a Steak 'n Shake when I was in college (east of the Mississippi) so I ate there all the time and loved it.  I saw this Steak 'n Shake as I was going to the AMC Centerpoint and thought I'd take a trip down memory lane.  I got the double cheeseburger with fries combo which was only about $4...cheaper than it was several years ago.  That should have been a red flag that something was wrong.  I placed my order and got food within 3 minutes...way shorter than the wait used to be.  This indicates to me that they prepare everything in advance (fast food style) rather than the cook to order method of the place I used to frequent.  The quality of the food was not good.  It had hints of the old flavors I used to enjoy so much but it was nowhere near the same.  The flavors were all watered down...even the fries.  It was even further away from the original taste than when you buy frozen entrees at the grocery store from real restaurants.  It's almost like a former employee half-remembered the recipe and tried starting a Steak 'n Shake on his own.    If this was my first experience with Steak 'n Shake, I'd never eat at another one again.  Luckily for me, I've had many other experiences and know that this restaurant is the exception and not the rule.  Unfortunately I waited to look at Yelp reviews until after I ate there, but I see many of them have the same complaint as me.  I will say that the place was clean when I was there (unlike other reviews stated).  If you're looking to have a Steak 'n Shake burger, don't get it here...go further east.",

One of the managers stated they were very sorry and she would bring my order right out to me..in about two minutes she w as at my table with a fresh and hot burger and fries.   Awesome!!!  A few minutes later she checked on me, then surprised we with a coupon for a couple free burgers on my next visit.  GREAT SERVICE,  GREAT PRICE, GREAT BURGERS, GREAT MANAGEMENT.  FIVE STAR LOCATION",

Cheese was watered down and there was no chili just a few beans and we for sure thought the shakes were going to be good but those were terrible as well. Pretty disappointed in this place because their pictures on the website looked amazing but it was not good at all.",

We ordered five various burgers, a footlong hotdog, chicken fingers, and shakes. The kids loved the food. We would go back and try it again, and hopes that it was cleaner.",

There's another restaurant chain called Freddys it does really well.  But steak and shake really takes me back to the old days. The great.... The burgers.  A tastegasm.  These are amazing.  The not great... The music is a bit loud. Also they do the fries different in three 'signature' restaurants.  They are not close to the Midwestern taste.  The manager explained it to me.  Props to him for taking the time.  The poor... The location.  Downtown Tempe is a nightmare for the working adults with jobs who have cars. This may be a great location for bike, but it's not good for car driving working adults. Overall... Great burgers",

    "text": "Many people have told me to be weary of this SnS as its not a True representation of what Midwesterners know and love. I didn't want to believe it until trying so for myself. They're speaking the truth, sadly. The SnS this Midwesterner knows & lives is not what is in AZ. Their HQ is in downtown Indianapolis, so I've grown up with this place.   The getup from the getgo is nothing like a normal Steak n Shake - you have to order from a cashier even if dining in. It's also not that classic black & white diner with red accents. Straight up futuristic-ish with red walls and weird tables/seating. The employees here don't wear the bowtie & paper cap -- they wear shirts that make them look like they're part of Graham Rahal's racing team. If you look at the menu, you'll notice many things off the regular SnS menu are missing - primarily all Chili Mac's, Orange Freeze, many shake flavors, and the turkey club. I was super excited to find my Frisco Melt on the menu, but disappointed with the taste - the meat is different, and there wasn't nearly enough Frisco Sauce on the sandwich. I've grown up to expect it dripping out from all 4 sides, and it was just a light splash. The fries are a little different - slightly saltier - but mostly similar.   I seriously hope that SnS management will find lots of land soon for a REAL, AUTHENTIC SnS consistent with the Midwest so the good people of AZ don't have to bear with the pathetic excuse for one on Mill Ave.",

All of the low reviews because of what they don't have is going to seriously detour an investor from putting up the 2 million plus that it takes to open a full service Steak and Shake in Arizona! Yes SNS Fans it costs an investor a minimum of 2 million CASH to open a full menu SNS. While it costs just over 250,000 to open the new \"Signature\" location option. Biglari Holdings took over SNS in 2008 and in the last few years began offering the Signature option to attract franchisees. If this location does well a full SNS will be in sight for the future. They are getting their feet wet in the AZ market.   I'm from Illinois where Steak and Shake originated; and yes I am highly disappointed that I cannot get a Chili Mac or a Chili 5 way or my beloved Hot fudge milkshake here.   However I am delighted that I can at least still get a stellar Original Double Steakburger, Fries and a Chocolate shake. THANK YOU TO THE OWNERS FOR BRINGING THOSE! I APPRECIATE YOU!!!!!!!!!!!!!  For those of you who are saying the burger is not the same, you are wrong!   You have to order the ORIGINAL STEAKBURGER! It is listed on the menu as the Original also. Not the organic burger or the signature burger they are bigger burgers.  Order the ORIGINAL FRIES and you wont get black pepper or cheese or vinegar.   Also Steak and Shake isn't like Freddy's Frozen custard; Freddy's Frozen custard is a knock off of Steak and Shake! Steak and Shake was founded in 1934, Freddy's 2002! NUFF SAID!  I've taken 3 or 4 people here and they loved it!",

The staff are very energetic and friendly. If you drink soda, they have a vast selection, and I do enjoy their shoestring fries. I'm very pleased to see this place here in Arizona.  Edit: The staff USED to be friendly. I see they've downsized quite a bit since my last visit. This time, I asked for a larger water cup because I can't drink soda anymore, to which the manager on duty told me \"no\", because those cups cost a little more. This was right after I'd just paid for my food. And so, my 5 star review is now a 3 star. Ah well. Will I be returning? That remains to be seen.  Edit 2 (last visit): So I returned, unfortunately. Smaller portions on the fries, and I waited over 30 minutes and there were maybe two other customers in the place. I'm done with this Steak N Shake. Makes me sad, but I have to let you go.",

I really didn't care for the meat, bread or toppings.  I didn't get what I ordered either... Bun, meat, cheese and ketchup.  There was a huge chunk of tomato on the bottom.  The fries were pretty good - super skinny.  The best part and the only thing I would come back for is the Salted Caramel Pretzel Milkshake.  Seriously yum!  My girls each had the grilled cheese kids meal.  They told me the grilled cheese tasted funny.  I wasn't interested in trying it to see why.
