They do that and still give good service to the rest of the bar. Food is good and the wings in particular. If you have a game to watch, go to zipps.",

Lynne, our adorable server was nice enough to let us hang out with water until 8.  On a Friday night, it's \"The Most Interesting Night\" of the week, so there are Dos Equis Specials, Jager for $3, and whatnot. I did serious damage here for about $20. You can get massice 32oz beers for $4.  It's no different than any other sports bar. Come here with people you like. Don't bring a debbie downer, or a sober driver (but make sure you take a cab, so that everyone can have a good time). This is the place to kick back with your friends and have a few, and a few more.  The bar food is solid. I asked for a gigantic bowl of celery sticks, and she obliged. we got the golden wings (medium), not really sure what that meant, but it was amazing. Also I sampled someone else's fries, and they were epic.  A bite of the turkey burger....delicious.   The food here is probably not healthy, but that's why we have gym memberships, and muscles. To burn that shit off.   Next time, I'm doing an all Mexican friday. Dos Equis and Fish Tacos.",

I've been to Zipps dozens of times at a variety of locations around the valley, with the Camelback location being closest to my house currently. I like all the TVs and the large smoking patio (weeee!) and the CHEAP drinks. But they sometimes enforce weird drinking rules, i.e. only 3 of their frozen Zipparitas, or 3 big beers. If you're eating and hanging out for a few hours watching a game or playing shuffleboard three drinks isn't that much.   Also service is super spotty. Sometimes they're nice and enthusiastic, other times they disappear for seemingly hours on end and act inconvenienced when you ask for things like water or extra ranch?   Golden medium wings is where it's at. Trust me, try them. (Their hot wing sauce is HOT, by the way). The Fresca focaccia is my other favorite - chicken, salsa, sweet jalapeno sauce and pepper jack rolled up in a long narrow wrap. Yum. Both of these items can be ordered for $6 if you catch them on the right night, as Zipps has varying food and drink specials nightly.",

Bartenders are always friendly and fast, fast is always good when it comes to alcohol. :)  Shuffleboard isn't always open, but the upside is...they have pool and the touch screen game thingy (that's my favorite).   If you don't want the unce unce, but what to be in Old Town this is not a bad place to be.  Also, if you want to change up the scenery Clancy's is next door which is also a great spot !",

A chicken Focaccia and a Greek salad without the chicken. By the time we finished eating we were there 13/4 hours. I must say that the waitress apologized for all the problems and did not charge us for the drinks. I have been to this restaurant many times and have never experienced this problem, that is the reason this did not get one star. By the way there food is very good for a reasonable price. I do recommend this restaurant, but if this should happen to you do not be so patient. I did tip the waitress 20% because that is the way she makes a living.",

The only time they seem to lack happy hour is from 7pm to 8pm lol. And I know that they have weekend specials for those weekend ball games and whatnot. It's awesome. The food is pretty yum too. The only reason I didn't give the place four stars is due to my experience tonight.   Zipps is a sports bar. And it's football (pre)season. They should have at least one TV dedicated to the home team, but they. I get that they couldn't get the ASU game due to the whole TV dispute, but to not have the Cards - Bronco game is ridiculous considering it's on ABC. And when they finally did have it on, it was a bit difficult to have someone change the channel on the right TV. I get that it was busy, but that shouldn't be an excuse to not listen to your customers. If anything, they should make a conscious effort to hear their customers and make sure they're happy.   Anyways, I'm sure i'll go back some time, but I'll probably have to call ahead and make sure they have the games I want on.",

    "text": "Zipp's is apparently a somewhat local chain that I'd never heard of until my most recent visit to the valley. Frankly? It was about as good as a subpar chain that I'd never heard of. I don't often recommend that classic chains over more local spots, but after a visit to Zipp's I'll argue that it's beat out by Hooters, Buffalo Wild Wings, etc. I've experienced better.   Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  The atmosphere at Zipp's is just fine, with a large selection of seating complimented by pool and shuffleboard, which was great for my party of twelve during our quest to find a good spot to watch some March Madness. The waitstaff, while not exactly quick or attentive, were offset by food that came out quickly, which I can always appreciate. Star Granted.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Another area where I can't really complain. A pitcher of decent beer? $10. An order of maybe 12-15 wings? $8. Sure, it's not the bees knees, but these were some fair prices that beat out what I would have found at Hooters, etc. Burgers, sandwiches and the like hovered around $10, which is fair enough. Star Granted.   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  It's here where things were just a little bit off. I was told before coming to Zipp's that there are two things that everyone should get: their wings and their foccacia. My party got both, and topped it all off with some fries, having ordered both their buffalo and 'golden' wings.   The wings were okay, and were surprisingly meaty, but I couldn't honestly spot the difference between the buffalo and the golden. Apparently the golden are supposed to have more of a bbq taste to them, but to me they just tasted like standard wings. Fair enough.  The foccacia, on the other hand, was very disappointing. Buffalo fillings were essentially just poor buffalo chicken, and the bread itself was nothing to write home about and ended up being quite a bit undercooked in my opinion. The fries? Awful, with very little flavor and a texture that can be defined as nothing short of soggy. All in all, not a great food experience. No Stars Granted.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Again, in my opinion Zipp's is trumped by Hooters or Buffalo Wild Wings, but it's a decent alternative with a lower price point. Even so, No Star Granted here. There are simply better options around the city.",

We used to come to Zipps a lot due to good happy hour prices, they have since raised the prices and now it's very difficult to recommend a place that looks the other way in many regards AND isn't very cheap.  First, it's probably not a bad idea to wash your hands after handling a menu anywhere, but wow their menus are dirty. The last two times I have been here my hands were sticky after touching them. Including the last time where I tried hard to only touch it with one finger. The table was only slightly cleaner.  Then the most egregious part of our visit, the tacos. I'll preface with saying that I am far from a taco snob. I enjoy anything from Taco Bell, Del Taco, Salty Senorita, etc. Wow, Zipps has the worst tacos I have ever eaten. You get four tacos, seasoned beef or chicken. I got 2 each.  The chicken and beef meats look almost identical and basically taste the same.  I should have taken a picture. Both are soupy messes that taste like what I imagine what dog food taste like. I hated typing those words because it sounds mean and sensationalizing, but it's True. The corn tortillas buckled under the load of the soupy, gross mixture that tasted like it's been sitting in a soup container waiting to be delivered to a poor unfortunate soul.  The tacos come with sour cream (which I luckily got on the side) and diced tomatoes which added to the mushy mess.  There was no cheese, lettuce or anything else on the tacos. But I did find large pieces of lettuce UNDER the tacos in the basket. Likely from a salad mix.  Luckily we got sweet potato chips which did offer texture and a pleasant taste.",

This weekend's update: we've noticed the signs ON EVERY TABLE for the breakfast at 9am during football season with a note \"until daylight savings\" next to the 9am, so we get here at 10am on the dot (since games start an hour later) and they're open. We order drinks around 10:15 and then try to order breakfast only to learn that the kitchen does not open until 11am, about 40 min from then. I ask the manager why the breakfast menus are on every table then, isn't that False advertising? She says its required by management, and if they were to walk in she would get in trouble. What the heck?? They have a menu on every table for breakfast but yet they do not serve breakfast. And its one of those standing specials menu , on the other side are weekend drink specials, WHICH IS ALSO ON ANOTHER MENU ON THE TABLE. Makes ZERO sense. I just don't understand.  And then this may just be me asking for too much, but in my opinion, customer service is huge, so at least be like \"I'm sorry for the inconvenient , here's a drink on us\" like .. a $4.50 bloody mary or what not. But no its, \"No breakfast ,it is what it is, sorry.\". The service and quality has drastically declined since we started coming to this Zipps location the last few years, super bummed about it.",

Last time I went service can be spotty. Ordered a drink and we had to ask other waitresses twice for an update. I don't go to bars for amazing food and can't really speak for any of their dishes other than my go to one, but they do have in my opinion one of  (or at least my favorite burger) the best green chili burgers in town. Love it.",

Be sure to check the deals for the particular day of the week that you go. You can usually save a good amount of money on great appetizers or drinks. The service has always been great.

Arguably the best happy hour in town (3-7pm). Zipp's has it made with awesome burgers and focaccias (really good wraps), and of course, those WINGS. Get them medium golden. The only downside is the lack of sauce variety, but the flavor and quality really outshine typical sports bar food. I've wasted many an evening watching games in this fine establishment. For good reason too - we're talking premium beers for $3 and 32 oz domestics for $4 or less. Toss in chips, salsa and guac for another $4 and you've got me as a fan for life!",

We paid the complete bill (which took about 30 min to because they would not split the check even after the manager himself said he would take separate cards) and once we all walked out everyone took off and the manager runs out and says that our bill was short $30.00. It was not short and he should check his cameras because someone took that money... We know that they took the tip out of the bill. We would have left a pretty good tip if we weren't treated the way they treated us that night. The manager is very RUDE and needs to learn about customer service!!!!",

I'm not one of those people who hear that a movie is bad and because they do so I avoid. Definitely not me!   So I decided to check it out around 2:45pm, I walked in and chose my seat way in the back. As the waitress arrived I asked for a water and soon got a water and a diet coke which I did not ask for. I had to say as she was asking me about appetizers that I only ordered a water, she did kindly take the diet coke away and didn't say anything after about getting the drinks wrong.   When she returned I was ready for my order which was a Green bay cup of chili and an order of the tacos where I got 2 of the beef and 2 of the chicken. They asked if I wanted the chili first and of course I said yes.  Okay, so my chili came to the table and I was sadly disappointed. It looked as though the bowl was already touched and the taste was just heat. It might look like a pretty picture to the eyes but I honestly had it and could only taste 'heat' from whatever spice they used, but no flavor. I was very disappointed as I thought there was going to be 'green chilis' as the description I read had on it as well as hey, this will actually have flavor!!  Beyond that lets move on, I got the tacos where I decided to get 2 beef and 2 chicken, what should be so wrong with that right? Well, if I could be modest well wow, the portion size was great for the price, but beyond that, not worth it at all.  This is my honest opinion because these all were can I say, awful! I had one of the Chicken tacos and had to squeeze the grease out to eat it and it was kinda okay because of the sour cream and tomatoes to mask the flavor. When I got to the beef taco cause I wanted to mix it up, I again squeezed it because of all the grease and took a bite and could not taste anything. I took another bite and I could taste a hint of cleaner, this is not good and I was done. I did not know how long ago they changed there grease in the greaser and tasting a hint of cleaner I felt they did not care about me at all!  I still had 1 chicken taco and a beef taco and I decided to give the chicken 1 more shot. I did not have any utencils but I decided to try it straight out of my hand and what I got was that canned chicken that I could buy out of the store. It had a tuna taste and just not cooked here kinda vibe. It was not good and honestly I have heard so much and would of hoped for more but deeply disappointed!   I would not recommend this place for the service but if you are looking for greasy foods as you drink and you don't pay attention to taste then this may be for you.",

First..our servers, Sheila and then her replacement Bridgette (who had some real nerve sporting the U of A shirt) and second the overall quality of this location....and lastly, Ohio State lost.  While the general consensus from our party (which was an ever-changing 8-9 people anchored by yours truly and a Chris V.) was that this location is smaller than the others but still roomy enough to get loads of people to watch the games w/ unobstructed views.  Tip: if coming w/ a big party to this location you better get there early.    The menu is typical bar grub so read not healthy what-so-ever.  Fried Chicken Salad?  Really?  You're not even trying to fool me to think its healthy.  It's not bad nor great...fills ya up so you don't get too trashed.  It is worth noting...our service was downright amazing.  Sheila and Bridgette were busier that one legged men in a butt kicking contest but were always checking on us and even refilling waters when only half empty...both were downright nice and willy to hang out for periods of time too...if I went back I'd request to be in their sections.  So I'd say overall the place is pretty decent...really kind of a can't miss.",

Stopped by Marleys on my bike earlier today while the football games were on. I know I misspelled it but Im too lazy and don't think enough of that place to bother with looking up the right spelling. Overpriced. I sat down on the patio and a hostess dropped a menu in front of me. No hello or any type of welcome. Not a word. Guess she was anxious to get back to texting.  Zipps is not owned by a local sports celebrity. That's a good reason to go there and not Marleys. They have outstanding food. Very reasonable prices. Super staff. I'm an airline pilot and eat at a lot of different places here and out of town. Zipps is simply one of the best.  (Not five stars because nobody believes those. This is a real deal review)",

One should go to Zipp's because of their kickass patio, complete with a fire pit and TVs at every imaginable angle in which to view games -- even if you are the last in your party to arrive and get stuck with the worst seat at your table.    The managers are always willing to switch it to the game you're interested in as well and don't give you the same kind of haughty shit that other sports bar managers do when you ask them to alter their precious programming schedule.  The food is good, for bar food of course, although i don't venture out very far past their Hot Wings.  They have really good beer on tap too -- nothing else quite like a 32oz. Alaskan Amber and some college basketball.  I would have to say that, as an avid sports fan who really tries to avoid watching important sporting events outside of my comfort zone (re: living room), Zipp's is the only place I will let host my antics.\"",

    "text": "I set foot into the fire, and felt the burn on my tongue.  I like wings, I always have.  The spicier the better, and finding wings that have that right amount of burn and flavor is hard to find.  Some places like to make their wings so hot that they sacrifice flavor for the prestige of being the hottest wings in the neighborhood, while some places have wings with all the right flavor, but you feel like a complete wimp for the lack of pain that you just consumed.  Zipps on Camelback is one of the those burn before flavor places, but only barely.  I heard about their \"hot\" wings, and scoffed at the idea of a trendy sports bar being able to cook my tongue with their sauce properly.  The waitress, a cute little number, came to us and took our order and I, being cocky and maybe somewhat stupid, told her to get my wings from the bottom of the barrel.  I didn't think they would exact some sick form of revenge on me for my boisterous dare.  I was wrong.  The wings came out in a good time, considering it was the early part of St Patrick's Day and they were a little busy.  As soon as they hit the table, my nose was filled with spicy aroma of habanero and vinegar, a good wing combination.  My grandfather, who smartly ordered tacos, looked at me like a priest reading rites to a death row inmate, smiled and wished me luck.  The first wing wasn't too bad.  I felt a little ting and smiled as I sucked it down.  Then I felt a little fire on the lips.  It was only slightly painful, but very managable.  I took the second wing in earnest, and bit down with the same defiant determination as the first.  More burn, but not too bad.  Around wings five, six and seven, I my head started to bead up.  Wings nine and ten, I was in full water sucking mode.  I didn't finish the wings...sadly a first for me.  I did take them home, thinking that they would be a great second day food.  Overall, I really liked the atmosphere.  I sat outside, so my addiction to cigarettes would be fulfilled, and my love of baseball was satisfied by the multiple big screens that surrounded the wooden tables and benches.  Service was top notch, and thank God the cups were huge (and filled with water).  I would recommend Zipps on Camelback because it is a good atmosphere and there is plenty of scenery in the female variety to look at.  The wings were good, not great.  Hot, but a little flavor was lost in the heat of it all.  My grandfather, a huge fan of tacos, raved about them, so I would trust them enough to go back and give them a whirl.",

For happy hour, they have different deals every day, inclduing both drink and food items.  A personal favorite is the monaco foccacia--a chicken, cheese and ranch foccacia wrap with a mild jalapeno sauce on the side.  With fries and/or onion rings, this is the perfect hangover meal.    We used to frequent Zipps on Sundays when you can get a bucket of beer for $10 (5 Bud Lights, what a steal), sit outside, watch football and play cards.  Fine, we're nerds, but I'm telling you, its the perfect ending to a weekend of debauchery.    Theres a ton of TVs (although not as big as some other bars) and service is good.  On game day, arrive early to be able to seat your whole party--or for those who want a more hands-on sports experience, try out the 2 shuffle board and pool tables.    Morning, afternoon or night, Zipps is a great place.",

    "text": "Lots of food was consumed at our table, so I'll start with the wings.  I like hot and spicy, so I ordered them hot.  The server told me their hot was VERY hot (note - they do have a VERY HOT category that is hotter than HOT - lol), and that if I don't like it, they won't refire it and it can't be sent back (clearly this is a recurrent issue and must come out of the servers pay or something.  Either way, she scared me sufficiently, and I NEVER send food back regardless), so, I ordered them MILD, expecting them to be HOT.  And they were, indeed, MILD.  So, my wonderfully cautious server brought me a cup of the HOT sauce.  Holy crap.  This shit was VERY HOT (not to be confused with the VERY HOT wings, mind you).    Is that clear?    To recap, the MILD is MILD, the HOT is VERY HOT, and the VERY HOT is...I was too chicken to find out.  All you really need to know on the wing issue is that if you over-order in hotness and you don't like it, you're screwed.  Moving on..  Had a blue cheese burger.  It had some strong earthy taste, almost like dirt.  I was afraid to check under the bun, as the server could have been annoyed with the wing drama, but it tasted like either weird pot, or dirt.  In reality, it was probably some strange oregano.  Or chervil.  Or marjoram.  Double patty, though.    Fries - good.  Onion rings - EXCELLENT.  Even the next day microwaved, they were yummy.  I wouldn't say I'd drop back in unless I was in the mood for a divey sports bar with wingitude, but I also wouldn't pout and sit in the car.",

    "text": "THIS PLACE IS AWFUL!!! I wish I could give it no stars. I had a terrible experience here and wrote my previous review earlier this week. Their PR person contacted me and asked more about it, so I told them. They asked if they could pass my information along to the Director of Operations/Owner and I received a two page letter degrading me and basically telling me that I am a self-righteous b*tch who knows nothing about customer service and I only care about myself.   Todd Goldman, the owner who so kindly took \"the time to teach young girls like [me] life lessons\" about customer service and the restaurant industry and point out that I \"get so mad and take it so personally that [I] fail to think rationally while [I] struggle with the idea that [I am] not the most important person in the world\". Apparently my \"myopic viewpoint and exaggerated opinion of [myself] are staggering\". Whatever he may feel about me, I do know one thing about him: I will never step foot in one of his establishments ever again. This does not seem to bother Mr. Goldman because, as he told me in his letter from this evening, according to him, \"[I] feel that [I] am so influential in this community that [my] posting will dissuade people from visiting [their] establishments\". I only wish I could attach the PDF letter that was sent to me that includes all of these lovely morsels of insight and opinion so you all could have the pleasure of reading it.   I cannot imagine ever sending something of this magnitude to an upset customer, and yes, I do hope that people read this and see that they should pick Fox Sports Grill, Half Moon, Blue 32, Firehouse Bar and Grill, Duke's, American Junkie or any of the 1000 other sports bars in Scottsdale/Phoenix to enjoy their bar food, beer and sports viewing. It is unbelievable behavior coming from a business owner and Mr. Goldman should be ashamed of himself.  ***ADDITION 10/19/2010*** I was currently in the building with 11 guests, sitting at a 6 person table when I asked to be accommodated.  I was not asking him to \"hold\" tables for us, I was asking that they take care of  \"actual customers\".",

(happy hour,  mon & thur after 8pm = $5). the extreme difference between medium and hot is not worth it. good but way too hot..  -specialty burgers. most are fantastic.  ask for any sauce \"on the side\"! youll get more. (black n bleu is my fave).  -fries. fresh cut. not a fan, but will still enjoy them if the option is there.  -lately, the monaco foccacia or however you spell it. the jalapeno dip is awesome.  -all other food is mediocre at best. salad's salad.  -beer = 3.50 for big mug (domestic) is a good deal at happy hour.  THIS (and the wings) IS WHAT MAKES US COME BACK.  -tv's can be changed to what you want if youre there on an off-night.  -service is typically good.  -managers can be douchebags (is that new?).  -parking does kinda suck on crowded nights, but dont be so damn lazy.  i do agree with some of what 'Jason C.' says, but will rate this place higher. hes bitchin bout little things. if youre there at the right time (happy hour or after 8pm) and stick to the right food(s), you should have a good time!   [this applies to the Via de Ventura ZIPPS also]  GOLDEN medium WINGS!!!!!!",

Zipps is a solid, down-to-earth place with many food, drink, and seating options, where you don't feel like you're being stared up and down.  Mad bonus points for allowing the option of half-and-half when you can't decide between fries and onion rings alongside your burger or sandwich.    I must deduct one star for the pizza-by-the-slice, which reminded me of the frozen pizza you buy at Costco, on account of the completely flavorless dry-ish crust.  Plus, the toppings literally slid right off, as though the pizza had been baked and then the toppings were sprinkled on as an afterthought (guess that's how they get away with selling pizza by the slice with any combination of toppings you can think of).  All in all, I do like Zipps and highly recommend it to anyone looking for a laid-back happy hour or night out.  Just stay away from the pizza.",

    "text": "I have to preface this comment with the fact that I am now gluten-free and it is a struggle for me at times... But if I go without the bun and I skip the breaded fries, I really enjoy Zips.   THE GOOD: I want to give Zips a top rating because their food is awesome! The burgers there may be the best that I have ever had. I can't choose between the BBQ or the Southwest... And their fries are reminiscent of the memories I had for McDonald's as a kid... Zips has the best food any bar can hope for... Please - pay your cooks more money!  THE BAD: Zips will nickel and dime you for stupid things like mayo and ranch... It just seems silly that they will charge $.75 or a dollar if you ask for a side item... and they don't tell you until you get the bill... How Rude!   THE UGLY: Their wait staff always seems to be unhappy. They often seem over-worked and unable to give better service. Their attitude has changed my experience on more  than one occasion... and that is too bad because their food is really good.",

It can have a nice blend of wing sauce and ranch (I subsitute ranch for blue cheese) and the next just chicken drowned in ranch without any spice. Mostly though this place is exactly what I'm looking for.",

    "text": "I used to live across the street and I would get the idea that I should go to Zipps and watch the ball game.  The problem is my team is the Yankees and they always gave me a hard time about turning that on.  If you like the local teams you'll have no problem but they have 100 screens so you would think they could accommodate a few other options.  In general I dislike bar food.  I particularly grew to dislike Zipps food.  Burgers with cold fries.  Servers who don't understand why I would want to send back cold fries.  Generally the service is terrible.  9 out of 10 times you get a server who just doesn't care.  The other 10% of the time you get a quality server who might be too busy to give you decent service.  And that would also be a business owners poor operational policy to cause the service to basically be bad.  I have had wings a few times that I thought was good.  My suggestion is if you are going here go if you want wings and to watch a local sports team.   Don't go if you are in a rush or wanting good,  I know they have coke which helps but it's usually not right and taste terrible.  I know the few times I went for adult beverages it was a disaster because the coke didn't taste right.  I have tried so many times over the last ten years. I have given this place a lot of tries hoping it would be better.  I am always disappointed.  It generally takes me getting really angry about something to leave a one star review.  I just feel that in general Zipps is one of the worst local restaurants.  This was the location I had the most problems at and when I noticed it had 3.5 stars I felt it was time to leave a review.",

However 6 months ago or so they printed new menus, changed some menu verbiage and raised the prices three dollars per item with minimal improvements. I'm not quite sure why I just paid 7 dollars for a side salad then an extra 50 cents when I asked for more dressing because my first 3oz ramekin of dressing was barely half filled. I get it. You need to increase prices but a side salad for 7.50 seems a little excessive and if you're gonna charge for extra dressing make sure the first one is at least filled properly.",

They apparently roll their tacos like a wrap? My order may have just gotten mixed up, but I didn't mind because the wrap was also wonderful.

We had a server, Shelby, who was hard to find and friends who left throughout the night, and paid their parts of the tab, which she was supposed to take off the bill.   At the end of the evening, I was the DD waiting for our check and to take my friends home. Our friend Tim split up the bill with cards listed and amounts divided out for her. She was to charge my card 40 (which was well over what I owed and included tip) charge another couple for their tab plus more, which included their tip, and put the rest on our friends card.   Except that Tim's sister had given her 60 in cash when she left and it hadn't been taken off the bill. We reminded her of this and she was insistent that it had been taken off-- finally she seemed to \"remember\" she hadn't taken it off when all of Tim's sisters food and drinks were still on the tab.   When I got my bill, I marked 0 for tip, signed it, took my copy and drove everyone home. I checked my account and saw the 40 on my card. Come Tuesday morning, imagine my surprise when 80 DOLLARS is charged to my card from Zipps. Fuming, I called the store and talked to a manager, Brady, who took my information, told me he had to call Corporate and would call me back. Still waiting on the call back.   I was even more pissed when I found my copy of the receipt with the 0 marked in my wallet and confirmed that she decided to give herself an extra tip. Now I have to dispute it with my bank because she felt like being a scumbag. Really hoping my bank will refund me my money.   THANKS ZIPPS FOR THE EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.",

    "text": "Place is a decent place to go if your plan is to watch a game and have a drink. Food selection/price was a joke. I ordered a chicken salad. I asked the waitress how much a side of chicken would be and how much I would get. I was told 6oz for $5. Which was acceptable. What I received was a couple pieces of cubed chicken on the salad and maybe 3oz on the side. I politely addressed the manager and he insisted the little bit of chicken I received was 6oz. Well, I know what 6oz of cooked chicken looks like. The manager could've remedied the situation very easily. Yet he insusted. So I asked him to take the chicken away. Terrible customer service. So instead of fixing the issue, he'd rather remain insistent, and lose out on the $5.00 charge AND the chicken. Good job in not turning a profit or pleasing your customer.  Nice ambience to watch a game and have a drink. Don't come here expecting a decent portioned meal for a decent price.",

The downside to this is if you are coming with a group only half of your table can watch one game and the other side of the table is watching another game which was annoying.   As for the food I was told there wings were amazing and hot so I ordered some hot wings only to find out they smell hotter than what they really are they were also pretty standard nothing amazing. I also ordered a green chile cheeseburger which was really good it was a pepper jack cheese burger with green chile from NM which made me feel at home. They also make homemade fries and onion rings which was a plus.   Overall there are better sports bars around, food is ok and nothing special would I go back? Maybe...",

Half of it was dry, as the sauce seemed to be sloppily distributed, the way I might expect a burrito at Taco Bell. Come to find out, it wasn't even the same thing I'd ordered last time. According to the waitress, there are a few different types of this dish. A piece of information that would have been useful when ordering, and without myself knowing this, how did they know which one I wanted then? I'm glad it was as good as it was the first time or I'd never return to try this item again. Now that I know this item comes in different varieties, I'll probably visit again sometime and make sure I order the correct one.",

    "text": "Do not go here expecting to have an attentive waitstaff and managers. My boyfriend and I have gone here many times solely to get quick wings and a beer. Consistently the service has been close to nonexistent as the servers rarely table touch to check up on meals or drink refills. I have worked in the service industry for quite a while and know how service should be given. The past two times I have gone here sparked me finally writing a review.  Today when we had dinner I decided to stray away from my norm (not the best idea). When I received my meal it was barely even cooked and there was soft dough around the entire thing. After waiting for a significant amount of time we finally flagged down the waitress to let her know my food needed to be cooked longer. Once everyone at my table had finished their food, my food was finally brought to me. I took a few bites and STILL so many of the pieces were doughy and they burnt my side to a crisp. Expecting a manager to table touch and make sure this meal was okay (like a standard customer service manager would), none ever came. Finally, telling the waitress once again that the meal was undercooked she said sorry and avoided coming to our table for the duration of our time. My food was barely touched and she never once asked me if I needed anything else. She quickly dropped off the check (with no modifications considering no food had been eaten) and made it obvious that she was extremely annoyed with the fact that I did not eat my food. I will not visit this establishment again anytime soon because this is not the first time I have received such rude and inattentive service.",

It was an apple cider beer. And our waitress was nice. My boyfriend and I however, did not pay attention when the waitress told his sister not to get hot wings because their hot wings are really hot. We got one basket of that and one of the golden ones. The golden ones were really good. But the hot ones were so hot that we couldn't even taste anything or enjoy it. And let me tell you, I'm not a sissy when it comes to spicy foods but man was it in enjoyable so if you can handle spicy like me, I don't recommend that because you can't enjoy it. So my recommendation is to get mild or medium or ask for a sauce thing to see if you can handle it. Oh and any extra sauces cost extra so just be careful.",

After the waitress and manager himself came out and told us he wouldn't split the bill, but would allow swiping as many cards and taking cash, to complete our bill. We were ready to pay and he comes out and told us he wouldn't accept different payments, only ONE CARD/CASH. We tried coming to an agreement because several people didn't even buy anything so it made no sense in why we would all have to split the bill.

    "text": "This particular location is getting one star for the following reason: I ordered medium wings and they gave me an order of hot. That wasn't a big deal. Accidents/human error happens. It was the way the MANAGER, of alllll people, handled it. I ordered my wings about 20 minutes before my cousins ordered theirs. As I took the first bite, I thought, \"Wow, these are really hot for medium,\" but I kept eating because I didn't know better. By my second wing, I'm sweating and thinking, \"These can't be their medium. They are way too hot to be medium.\".....so I ask my other cousin to try a wing. He agreed that they were extremely hot and that they must have accidentally given me hot. His sister and her husband dipped their finger in the sauce and were like, \"Whoa, you need to say something because they probably gave you hot by accident.\" By this point, 2 and a half wings had been eaten. Just before the MANAGER came to give us another order of wings (that my cousin ordered LONG after I ordered mine), my other cousin and her husband also tried the sauce. She said the medium didn't taste like mine. So....I asked the manager if I had an order of medium or did they accidentally give me hot. He looked at my wings for less than 2 seconds and said I have the medium. I said, \"Are you sure?\" He said yes in a very irritated voice. So I questioned again and asked him how he knew. He said that I didn't have a red toothpick.....so I pick up the red toothpick in my tray and say, \"This one?\"  After he saw, instead of taking blame, he said, \"Oh, then you must have ordered the hot.\" I said, \"No, I didn't order hot. I ordered medium. What happened?\" Again, he places blame on me and says, \"Oh, then you grabbed someone else's order at this table.\" He said it in such a way like he was not going to do anything about it because it was my mistake. During this whole time, I am remaining calm and being very polite. My cousin could not believe the way he was handling the situation with such an attitude so she gets involved and we all say that nobody at our table ordered hot. I couldn't hear what he said to my cousin, but I see him nodding his head no and shrugging his shoulders like, \"Sorry for ya\" kind of thing. That's when I ask for our waitress because she was very kind and I KNEW she would rememeber that I ordered medium, as she was the one who advised me to do so. Again, I can see him annoyed with me, as he's asking her what happened and he's just hoping she's going to prove me wrong.....except she doesn't. She tells him yes; I did order medium and that nobody at our table of 13 ordered hot, and that yes, it was Zipp's mistake. He was very unhappy to take the wings back and I could tell that he thought I was lying, and it was as if he thought I just wanted free wings. We still gave the waitress a good tip because it wasn't her fault that the manager was so awful, but we just couldn't believe that the manager was so, so rude. Besides that, the food was good and the spot was a good place to hang out and enjoy friends and family.",

They have daily specials, game day discounts, and also HH. It's typical bar food though, with fried apps, burgers, and pizzas. The Green Chicken Chile Rolls were fun but greasy, and didn't have much cheese. The sweet jalapeno dipping sauce was weird. Their \"foccacias\" are similar to cut pinwheel wrap sandwiches. The primo steak version was tasty, as were the fresh onion rings.

Anyways, after standing around and stalking two tables, we finally snagged one! I must say, it was slightly awkward standing around watching people and not be able to stand with a drink in hand at least.  I got my favorite golden wings. Finally figured out the perfect combination. I got them medium hot with hot sauce on the side. Which was PERFECT spice level for me. I could control the spicy heat level by dipping my wings into the hot sauce. My mouth is watering as I type this...  We also got the cookie skillet which was a perfect finishing touch with the ice cream on top. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meals and we were all happy campers :)",

They have some strict rules & guidelines on food . Like if you prefer all drumsticks for your wing order , you will never get that . Not even for an extra charge . But the past few wing orders , the wing to drumstick ratio has not been correct and there were no apologies. I am sure there are many more rules of the menu that I am unaware of .  Yesterday was a complete joke with chambord margaritas. The GM was very defensive when we requested her to look a margarita ( for lack of chambord ) She calmed her bartenders have been over pouring and this is how it has to be . She went back and added a couple drops more .. but she was not happy . Myself and my party have been coming to all zipps locations for over 10 years . We know what the margaritas are suppose to look and taste like . And side note , she had the dirtiest shirt on .   So we are going to assume  , the liquor costs are up and this GM is trying to cut her cost and does not know how to do it . They are losing dollars over pennies !! Very Petty ! Reality check needed .  Oh and my friend wanted to add they do not have bud light on happy hour any longer at all Zipps  - and is not too happy .",

We even pulled on it to check what it was, and it was sliding out of the focaccia. My gf nearly vomited. So, naturally we sent it back. BUT THENNN, the manager came back and said it was my gf's piece of hair!!! Whaaaat??!?! We'd been here for nearly an hour ate 3 other items and onto our 3rd round of drinks - what did she think, we sabotaged the focaccia!?!?! LMAO What a JOKE.

We smile and wave at the waitress to let her know more people joined and she purposely makes us wait at least 10 minutes.  I am not a fan already... but yes, it gets worse, people. She brings our drinks out after another table sits down and orders theirs. Our friends are catching on and order a round. Get them before ours. Gosh, does she discriminate against blondes?? I am wondering. Our food comes out cold and I asked for extra ranch for the wings. Didn't get it.  At this point I go up to the manager and ask if the gal is super busy tonight or if something is up in the kitchen. No, and no. I tell him what's going on and he tells me he'll come out in a moment.  Oh... that moment was priceless. He actually said we were rude to her and should be lucky she even continued to serve us. He must be screwing her so I am OUT OF THERE! My tip to folks. Sit at the bar if you must go. There are plenty of other spots out there that will treat you wayyyyyyyy better, have better service, food and prices.",

One word of warning if you order one, they're not the traditional sandwiches, but more like a wrap made out of focaccia. It sounds strange, and you'll give it an odd look the first time you see one, but trust me, it's good.   There's a great outdoor patio assuming you're there on a night that isn't hot. They have plenty of TV's set up around the place, but you don't have a good view of all of them, so Zipps isn't really the kind of sports bar you'd want to go to see all the games. It's more of Monday Night Football spot, it's better to go if there's only one or two big games going on.",

Nursing a killer hangover from the night before, I ordered  a Coke to begin with.   The Coke tasted like they have moldy lines or something.   A couple other guys I was with ordered Mr. Pibb and each of their drinks had the same \"musty\" taste as well.  I had the jalepeno burger and fries and they were both pretty good.  Nothing out of this world, but decent.  The service was terrible.  Actual exchange between my friend and the waitress:  friend: I'll have the Caesar salad. waitress: chicken caesar salad? friend: No, just a regular caesar salad. waitress: what kind of dressing do you want with that? friend: I'll have the ranch (ok he didn't actually say this part, but i wish he would have)  it's a freakin' CAESAR SALAD! Without the caesar dressing it's just a salad.    Food was OK. Service was...curious.  Beverages were bad.",

The service here sucks giant rhino balls, to put it bluntly. Which seems odd considering the number of wait staff they typically have.  I went in here with a group of about two-dozen people on a Tuesday night in 2009 and they carded all of us. Fine. We all came straight from the job (guitars, think about it) so it's not like we were dressed down. One guy which with us, age 32, was from Mexico and had his national ID. And these fools wouldn't accept it! Even the manager! Ok, so we took our $300+ to the place next door (One Eyed Dog, now Clancys) and they served us all.  But that's not it. I've come here only because of proximity and waited what seemed like 5-10 minutes to get a drink on a slow weekend! It's like the waitstaff puts a priority on their texts and that's it. Fuck this place, the only reason I give it 2 stars is at least their hamburgers are decent.",

Are they efficient?.....Not usually.  Do they get the orders right?.....most of the time.  Do I love this place anyway???.....ABSOLUTELY!  Here's why -   Value of Happy Hour / Reverse Happy Hour / Weekend specials - 5 stars!  There are not many places you can get a slice of pizza, a basket of wings (Golden Medium, yummm) AND a 32 oz frosty beer for about $10 bucks.  They have daily specials, happy hour specials, weekend specials, and late night specials.  If wings are not your thing, try the Monaco Focaccia - it is to die for!  Ambiance - Ehhhh - 3 stars.  This is just your typical sports bar.  No special ambiance to note.  However - bring your shooting skills, and give the arcade game Big Buck Hunter a try for some laughs, OR coerce your friends into playing some pool.  I will concur with previous guests comments that the management at this establishment leaves something to be desired.  I have had several experiences where management failed to provide a service or take care of a customer, and was less than apologetic about their unwillingness to help.  All in all, I love Zipps - mostly for its convenience and it's cheap prices.  I'd still recommend it though! :)",

As long as you continue to do that I will continue coming for all the playoff games (thank you)!! This location is awesome! Staff was super friendly- AND they have Sam '76 on draft!!!!!! I was pumped for that! Wings were definitely good (not grilled unfortunately, so certainly not a favorite) and they gave us two sides of ranch (for each of our order of the wings) which was nice. Chicken skewers looked good, but I didn't try them.",

Give your customers what they order instead starring at them wierd after all I was going to pay for it. It wasnt going to be free. Order fries with the meal.

She states harshly \"It's open seating\". Well thank you!  2nd, After eating my salad for about 10 minutes the server came and dropped off my check saying \"No rush, but here's your check\". Okay, thank you again lol. This shouldn't even be done until I ask for the check like all places.  I was completely nice and always smiling, but apparently the girls here in Oldtown Scottsdale are very judgmental and not providing superior customer service.

When we finally placed a drink order some never came. When I went to check on it myself the employee I checked in with was extremely rude stating the delay was \"because they're busy\", showed no empathy or willingness to assist.

The servers are top notch, and the patio is a chill place to chat with friends or people watch.  Tuesdays and Thursdays are the best nights for food: Tuesday for 6 dollar specialty burgers and Thursdays for foccacias.  The patio has heaters for chilly winter nights and misters for the summer.  There is a drawback though... As this location trains managers and servers for their new locations, you can have off nights.",

There was no place to sit except one tiny table in front of a big screen TV. I bellied up and tried to order fast. There was a crowd of jocks that thought screaming at oddly placed TV's would help their teams to win. I kept trying not to look their way, but I was sitting right in front of the TV so that was a bit difficult. The waitresses that couldn't hear me order so it took about 4 attempts. Once she did hear me she must have forgot I odered in the first place because 2 glasses of tea later I had to hunt her down to order again. Maybe she got brain damage from being around screaming goons all day.. Who knows. The atmosphere was bad, the service was bead... But still 3 stars because they have the BEST wings I've tastes in a long, long time. Next time though, I'll order them to go.",

And sometimes you are dirty; yet sometimes, you're freshly cleaned!  Your service is consistently outstanding, when it doesn't suck.  Your patio is delightful, when it isn't crowded and awful.  Your fries are marginal; yet your sweet potato chips are delightful.  First time today with your onion rings, that are quite tasty I must say!  I just wish I liked onion rings.  Your sweet jalapeno burger is always a crowd pleaser, and today was no exception.  The secret sauce is so delicious, I want to bathe in it, and put it on everything.  Dear Zipps, you always manage to attract the most interesting crowd - businessmen to sports enthusiasts; douchebags to posers; teens to senior citizens.  Parking is always easy; and there is always a timely sporting event to watch.  I don't want to see in your kitchen; but the food always comes out quickly.  Your salads are fresh; and appetizers are tasty.  Most notable - your happy hour is ALWAYS exceptional, and beers are always cold, and large.    Oh Zipps.  Oh Zipps,  Oh Zipps.  I do like you today.",

    "text": "I have been a patron at zipps for a long time and at many different locations across the greater metropolitan area. This one on camelback I live nearby so I visit it most often. I am also a bartender for the last 7 years. CJ the bartender gives some of the worst customer service I've seen in a long time. I sit in the same bar stool and order the same thing every time I go in there. For one, he never recognizes me. I've probably been served by him half a dozen times in the last few months alone. Last time I was there, I ordered what I always do. After delivering my beer and food he never checked in to ask how the food was or if he could get me anything. I guess he forgot the two minute two bite rule, but there was only about 6 people at the bar. He was busy in conversation with the servers about restaurant problems. When I had finished my beer and my food, he just said,  \"Do you want your check yet?\" To which I was stunned. Usually you would ask if everything was ok, or if I could use a refill on my Budweiser. So I said, \"no..but I will take another beer and some to go food if thats ok with you.\" I took my new beer outside to smoke a cigarette. As I returned, my bar stool had been hijacked by someone who asked if someone was sitting there. CJ replied, \"Oh there was but he'll be fine.\" So I moved down three bar stools and waited for my to-go wings. I tipped about 22% but I was really pissed I did. So I feel this review is worth more than stiffing him on a tip, since he never recognizes me anyway.   I don't think I can go there to have beers anymore. They're lucky that the focaccia is freaking amazing and the wings are hands down the best in the state. I will say I have been served plenty of times at tables as well, both with friends and by myself, over the last 5 years i've been going to the camelback location, and I have always had pretty excellent service from all the girls. I think I'll just have to stick to getting to-go food from there or visit a different zipps.",

Parking is kinda hard since it's located in a busy plaza. So be patient. This location is a happening place.",

I have been a Zipp's customer for over 20 years, but  I am never going back there again.  Long story short my family and I had a very negative experience yesterday. Manager on duty received several complaints about cursing and obnoxious behavior by a group sitting on the patio and takes no real action to stop it. So My 81 year old Dad reminded the group that there were several families overhearing their yelling etc...my dad asks them for some respect under the situation... but the behavior continues. I get up and find the GM after approaching the table and i am verbally mocked by the group. When i find the GM, another gentleman was already complaining about the drunk group...   Manager asked the group to quiet down, but the same actions continued when i asked him again to remove the group he said no one else was complaining and he was busy....  Manager took no real action in support of a Family environment...   not sure why they have a kids menu if they don't value family friendly service mentality",

I had a large party of 15 people and even though we started at 5pm the last round of drink were charged at regular price because our waitress put it in just after 7pm. Its not my fault it had been over 20 minutes since her last visit to our table and then she took so long. Closing my final tab at 7:30pm and the fact I brought this up, she should have just credited me the difference (it was only $15, and its the principle). If you have a problem with your order,  don't count on them to make it right, even after spending over $450.  Anyways, food was pretty good, especially the golden wings and cookie pie with ice-cream (hence why I didn't give them 1 star) but overall, there are much better places to go. Bummer because I really like the outdoor patio area.",

There's always a special; except for one hour between 7-8, we like to refer to it as the 'un-happy hour' but that doesn't distract from the good time you'll have.  The beer is always cold and the glasses are generally chilled, unless they're super busy, then they're freshly cleaned.  The staff is friendly and plentiful.  There's generally a manager cruising the floor (or helping the waitstaff when it's really busy) making sure everything is going as expected.  My only negative is they don't allow dogs on the patio like almost every other bar & grill with a patio in the area (Duke's, Pranksters Too, The Habit, The Morning Squeeze, Gilligan's, etc.)  The reason they give is due to health codes.  Regardless, they have their reasons and it doesn't keep me from going, but it does keep me from going as much.    Still, lots of sports on the TVs, cold beer and good food; all at reasonable prices, especially for Scottsdale.  Paired with friendly, consistent service.  Zipps is a great place to hang with friends.",

    "text": "Very rarely will I write a review, but tonight's experience at Zipp's leaves me no choice.  Our waitress, Lacey P, had an attitude from the moment we arrived. I'm not sure what was bugging her, but it was certainly nothing that our party of three did.  Midway through our meal, as she was clearing plates off the table, she accidentally dropped a carrot slice from somebody's salad into my beer. That's no big deal. Staff has accidents all the time. The issue just begins here though. Lacey P didn't apologize or acknowledge me. She simply took my half finished beer, and after five minutes, returned with a new beer in a smaller cup. She explained that I received the smaller cup because the beer she had ruined was not a full beer.  I'm not going to fight with a waitress, however if you make a mistake, you need to correct it properly. A simple apology would have been fine and no new beer would have been necessary.  The night was fine again until it was time for Lacey P to remove the rest of our plates. At which time, she flung a knife across the table, assuming it would land in our wing basket. However, said knife did not land in said wing basket. It landed about 4 inches from my leg.  I find this behavior dangerous above all. I can't, in good conscience return to Zipp's ever again. I can get over poor service, but I absolutely can't get over such blatant disregard for safety.  Lacey P, if you're having a bad day, don't come into work. It's that simple. No need to endanger Zipp's customers.  What a terrible, terrible experience.",

Everything you'd want in a sports bar. Well listen up, about 80% of the servers there are just straight twats. The customer service blows big ones. Idk why they've even got attitude, some of them aren't even cute. Check yourself girlfriend. I get it, you're busy. But we're your customers, get that bitchy look off your face. Enough with that rant, aside from their god awful customer service - some of their items are mediocre at best. They charge you for every side of ranch. Oh wait, you're not making enough money off all the drinks we have there, you need $.25 for the ranch too? It's a pet peeve of mine. Don't charge extra for condiments!   Sad thing is even tho I get so frustrated with this place, I'll still come here and tolerate their rude servers because sometimes you get lucky and there's a new server who isn't jaded like the rest of those B's.

You'd never expect to find such a lush green and very tasty salad at a sports bar.  Prices are impressive and the staff is always friendly.  Seating can be tricky in the evenings or on the weekend, so it's best to get there early to beat the crowds.  Again, my only complaint is the lack of sweet potato fries.

Too bad she couldn't describe the difference between their cup of chili and their bowl (a $1 difference). Pay the extra buck to avoid getting pissed at the salsa cup it comes in, lol. Also, we got the Monaco focaccia sammich wrap, which wasn't bad, although the surrounding birds received most of the excessive breading. Our server offered spending an extra buck-fitty since we were splitting the wrap, in order to receive separate sides. If you are into flavorless, deepfried potatoes and flour-covered, seasonless onion slivers, I highly suggest these side orders if you like to waste your money. Aside from the nice patio environment and decent, greasy chili, I would've rather picked up hotdog and thirst buster at circle jerk and saved about 23 bucks, lol!",

    "text": "Super Bowl Sunday. I'm in a strange town and I want to watch the game. My indecision about where to go was quickly decided for me by my concierge who pointed me toward Zipps.   I got there with plenty of time to spare and was greeted at the door by the nicest guy who was very accommodating to make sure I had a seat. He offered me outdoors (too bright to see the TV's) , inside (the stool was higher than the table- not good for long periods of sitting) or at the bar (Perfect).   After getting though my Goldilocks phase, I settled in at the bar and got some great service from Shauna, the bartender who never lost her smile no matter how many directions she was being pulled in. In fact- she is the reason for the 4th star as she made me right at home at her bar from the first beer ordered. And there was none of that \"catering to the men\" thing that makes me nuts when the bartender is a cute female. She was on her game for all!   Plenty of TV's in this place.  Three alone over the bar, more outside and even more scattered through out the bar.  There is also a pool table and other bar games.  The food was just okay. I had a burger which came with a novel idea of half and half fries and onion rings. The food came up fast and hit the spot but it wasn't anything special. The fries were soggy and the onion rings were over done but the burger was pretty good with the meat seasoned perfectly. The menu is quite diverse, though, ranging from burgers to pizza to salads.   Nice clientele too. I had read some Yelp reviews about what kind of person frequents this place but I have to say- there was a good mix of tourists and locals and if the two guys sitting by me were any indication of people who normally frequent this place- I'd go back if I lived in the area (but maybe it was a different crowd given it was Superbowl Sunday) as they were friendly and fun to hang with for the afternoon.   Yay Zipps! You made my Super Bowl Sunday fun versus sitting at a hotel bar. And that's saying alot.",

I go there sometime to catch a baseball gave but if your not a fan of the local team sometimes they turn it off before the games over.  And never go there on a football day.  But probably the most annoying aspect of this place is how consistent the service is bad.  I had a new server a few weeks ago who was great but shes gone now.  So good luck if you want good service.  And pretty much every time I go with someone else they mess up their food.  Which isnt to say its the servers fault.  The only reason I can think that they dont mess up my food is I usually dont give special instructions. So I think you get the idea about this place.",

Not unfair in the outrageous sense, just slightly inflated when you're dealing with food that average at best.   It's a fun place to go in a huge group and pass around pitchers but not necessarily the best around. I would be more inclined to patronize Dos Gringos or a True dive to delve into those sorts of hijinks.   Zipp's not-so-comfortably straddles the line between pure sports bar and Scottsdale scene, since so many pre-partiers stop by in their clubbin threads on the way to Axis or Pussycat Lounge or wherever.   I have a theory that in the right group, any place can be a five star find, and I still believe it. Keep that in mind when you head towards Zipp's.",

The food is not great and the service is unusually horrible but they have a big selection for my business clients to choose from as most have different tastes and it is more of a relaxing environment in which most like. One Sunday, 2 friends and I were having lunch at a table for four people.  They sat a stranger with us to have lunch....very awkward, but was okay as we were all drinking beers.  About two weeks later (on a Friday), I was entertaining potential clients discussing our company and answering other questions.  There were three of us sitting at a table for four people.  They had the \"balls\" to sit another guy at our table as they say they were now sitting groups together to fill all spots.  I told the manager that we were discussing business as he seemed to not care and still sit the guy with us.  Needless to say, I have never returned to a zipps and never will.",

Everyone has their opinion, and it's all you can do to smile and pretend you care.  This guy was very adamant about Zipp's, and so we decided to look into \"the hottest wings ever.\"  We were so glad we had Mr. Chatty McChatterson as our driver because he was right!  Zipp's has TO DIE FOR wings.  The golden hot was our order, and although a notch down from the hottest flavor, they were still pretty hot.  They are made with habenero peppers and bbq sauce, and dipped in either ranch or blue cheese, a party is created in your mouth.  We thought we made it for the happy hour or even the reverse happy hour, but we managed to make in between those times, go figure.  Go before 6 or after 8 to make your experience even cheaper.  Oh, and grab a zipparita too - a strawberry one.  They seem to compliment the wings quite well!  Go for a game or with a group of people - tons of tv's and a great outdoor space to enjoy drinks and wings.",

But the last time I was there I had a really bad experience. My well-vodka soda tasted like it was poured in a poisoned glass. It was beyond gross. Undrinkable. I tried. My buddy had a well vodka cran. Same exact thing. Something was off. So after trying to choke it down I complained. I said, it's not a big deal. DON'T WANT TO MAKE A BIG DEAL OUT OF IT, but... it's gross. There is something wrong with something. So the fucking manager comes out and tells me that well vodka doesn't taste good. Thanks, Asshole. I drink well vodka ALL THE TIME and it doesn't taste like a chemical cocktail. So then he tells me that it comes out of his pay. Dude, are you serious right now? I just wanted a new fucking drink. Didn't want to enter psycho therapy with you. I'll pay for the drink. So now I don't want to go there anymore even though the food is really really good. Amazing. I'll probably go back but I hope the owner realizes his manager is Scottsdale's biggest tool.",

The waitress took ten minutes to greet my friend and I then we asked for water with lemon and she didn't bring out the lemons. We asked her again and after ten minutes I just went to the bar to ask for them. Next she finally brought out our food, and we begin to eat and realize that the sandwich (the Monaco focaccia Cajun style is awesome!) didn't come out Cajun-style. When we asked her she said it was and just walked away. We have been there multiple times so we knew that she was wrong but didn't care, and we had to ask for silverware and napkins to eat with. Overall that was the worst zipps experience I've had.  It's too bad the service sucks here because I really do like the food.",

Arriving around noon, we found several televisions that we were able to change to our game.  We also learned that there was a special happy hour available even on Sundays where we were able to order a full 18 inch pizza for only $10.  In fact, there is a great menu with both happy hour and reverse happy hour deals for drinks and food.    Though the pizza was a great deal, the pizza was not the best.  The service, on the other hand, was very good.  The waitress stopped by every few minutes to check on us.  I probably won't order the pizza again, but I'll definitely come back another day to enjoy the sports atmosphere and perhaps order a specialty burger or wings.  There are also several Zipp's around the city, which are in pretty convenient locations.  I have had positive experiences at all of them.",

    "text": "I was here for Happy Hour a couple weeks ago and I realized that I have never written a review even though I have been here many times. Since I know my adoring fans are anxiously waiting to hear my thoughts on this place, I am happy to oblige.  Zipp's is not a bad option for a work lunch since they have a pretty large menu and can accommodate big parties. The food is mostly bar food with burgers, pizza, fried apps, and wings as their specialties, none of which are my top choice for lunch. But they do have the option of what they refer to as focaccias; they are sort of a cross between a wrap and a panini.  Those are pretty tasty but unfortunately they all come with mayo or some other kind of creamy sauce (yuck!) and so I have to order it without and hope the kitchen gets it right. My go-to item is actually the honey balsamic salad. It is really filling because of all the stuff that's in it and the dressing is really good and goes well with the goat cheese. Overall its not the best food in the area (hey, its Scottsdale after all) but its a safe bet since there is something for everyone and the prices are reasonable.  Zipps is also a great place for happy hour. They have a large patio that is just fantastic because of the wood and comfy seating. You kind of get the feeling you are hanging out on a friend's deck. It can get a little crowded at times, especially on Fridays. And I wish there were more shade. But when the weather is nice you can't beat sitting out in the sunshine with a cold beer watching the game (yes they have tvs outside). Even when the heat drives you inside to the a/c, this place is still worth a visit because of the $3 pints. That's a pretty good deal. They also have $4 for the large 32 oz but that doesn't include the \"premium\" beers.  Overall, there is nothing that really makes Zipp's a \"must try\" place but it is a pretty decent option to go and grab a beer after work.",

This is a place for large groups to chug beer, watch sports highlights, and if brave enough, chomp on greasy bar food.   $8 for a freaking pitcher of Ranger IPA made me a happy camper. That's all I really need! I can have one of those and call it a night. But you know me, I like to party.   Prices on shots like Fireball and Jager were also very reasonable. This is such a great place to be social; I like watching the occasional early walk of shame around 1:30 from the patio while I chat it up with friends.   Apps were interesting...I tried some sort of roast beef spring roll, but it wasn't my cup of tea. No matter what, the food is inexpensive, and the kitchen is open late. Men, if you don't want to deal with an army of bros and cheap cologne, come here. Ladies, if you don't feel like 5 inch heels and pushup bras, stop by. This place is fun.",

She ended up passing our table over to another waitress but failed to tell us she was doing so, she never even gave us 1 update about our order. After sitting for a little over an half hour, we were finally asked if we were ok but of course at this point the answer was no and the question was where is our food? The new waitress was very nice and apologized for the experience we were having. She gave us updates and got our food out to us as fast as she could... she is the only reason I'm giving a 3.

I will say, if I could only rate the service and staff, they are 5 stars...Jordan, Kat, Cj, Katie, Bethany, Allison, and Kelsey, just to name a few of who we have got to know who have been there awhile, always happy to take care of the customers, however this Yelp is not about the them, it's about those who own the franchises in the Phoenix area... mind you it's one family that owns all the Zipps in the valley. For the last two years, the misters did not work properly until this summer, the heaters work occasionally or not at all, the TV's need replacing cause pictures are blurry or a TV just doesn't work, signage lights have been out and not working for a long time, and regular patio lights just burned out and not replaced. The bugs have been dead inside your Main Zipps sign for the last three years, I like seeing them when I'm eating. I find it funny how you manage to keep your great staff when your customers complain to them about the upkeep and in turn your staff is making excuses for you... the owners. There are much better places that are up to date, have better patios with working equipment, and more healthier food options. In the end , price doesn't matter, people will pay more when their needs are being met and by the looks of your popularity over the years, you are losing. It's no wonder that your business is empty on big sports nights, because you are not making your place stand out. Instead you keep building more Zipps in the Valley, you should capitalize on your biggest patio bar in the area, Scottsdale Old Town, poor business decision on your part. I posted some pictures, so all could see first hand as well as a picture of our regular black olive pizza slices.... definitely cutting back on the Vegetables, usually cannot see the cheese over the black olives, however obvious money is tight.",

I haven't been to this location in many years, but we were in the area recently running errands and decided to stop in for a quick bite between appointments.  It was a Saturday afternoon and luckily it wasn't very busy.  We didn't have much time so we ordered a drink and some chips and salsa.  The server was very friendly and attentive.  The chips and salsa came out quickly and were pretty tasty.  I think we were able to get in, have a beer and nosh, and get out in less than half an hour.  I appreciate the speed when we were on a time crunch.  I would definitely come back when in the area.",

The waitresses are... interesting, the beer selection is bland, basically just the big names, Coors and what not, and it was filled with elderly people eating alone... it was depressing. Maybe I went on the wrong day. I would come back for those wings, some of the best I've ever had, but otherwise, I'm not impressed.",

It's the kind of hot that creeps on you too, so if you are as hungry as I was you may have wolfed down two-three wings before realizing you mouth is on fire!  But they tasted SOOOOO good I couldn't stop.  Zipp's loses a star for slow service on the water.  If you have someone order the hot wings an ice cold water should come automatically.",

When I'm not in the mood to get my hands dirty, I'll usually get the chicken skewers or the chicken strips, with golden sauce to dip in of course. Also, they have good ranch and honey mustard here.",

The server was really cute and attentive but she had no clue what to suggest for a non meat eater I was struggling to find anything appealling here. She finally suggested a salad. It was good it had candied walnuts and dried cranberries w goat cheese on it but by the time I got it everyone had eaten and I stole a bunch of their fries so I couldnt eat the whole colassal salad. I just read Dallas' review I wish the girl would have suggested their veg burger sad. I might go back if I had to.

    "text": "Zipp's Sports Grill is exactly what it appears to be...there isn't any nuance and if you are expecting any, you are likely in the wrong place! If you want a pretty good burger, pretty good wings, pretty good salads, pretty good sides (fries, rings, etc.) Zipp's will do nicely.  No, I won't tell you that they have the best anything, but they do a decent job across a pretty broad range of sports bar food...nothing that they make is crappy. Once again, this was a place that I quit patronizing for awhile, until the cigarette smoke and the after-effect smell got wrung out of the building. But, I'm glad to be back. I played Squash for a couple of hours on Saturday morning and I was pretty hungry at lunch, and Zipp's was close by, so... We hadn't been in for several months (so many restaurants, so little time), and was nice to come back. The service was terrific, prompt and friendly. It may depend on who you get as a server, or the time of day (we were there for lunch) but we've always been lucky and well taken care of at Zipp's. I had a Zipp Burger and the Beautiful Carin had a big ol' chopped salad. Both were good and tasty, well prepared (even down to getting Carin's order right...no cheese, 2 different dressings on the side, etc., etc., etc.). After de-toxing with couple of hours of hard exercise, re-toxing at Zipp's was a good way to get my cholesterol levels back up!",

    "text": "I go to Zipps quite often and nothing has ever been an issue, but last night while trying to enjoy a nice outing with my friends/coworkers things took a turn for the worst. We had friends show up early to reserve a table for 8, we met up with them and sat down, ordered drinks, and everything seemed to be going smoothly. But then throughout the night, rude remarks and attitude was given by the server (not going to mention names because you know who you are) . You could tell she just clearly did not want to be there. The main issue occurred when the checks were brought to the table. Everything was unorganized. With ALL of us  at the table working in the restaurant industry (including our manager), we DO understand rough days and the business. But I have NEVER felt so uncomfortable at a restaurant. She then proceeded to drop the checks off... one check book had a salad on it, I recognized it was not ours and put it in the middle of the table.  We situated our money and she then came by to picked up our tabs. But before she could even do that...she snapped at our table saying we had some other tables check book, I said \"yes, we put it in the middle of our table because it wasn't ours\", she then says \"well where's the money that was in it\" we say there was none that we had seen. She then pulls aside the table that the check belonged to as they are exiting and questions if they paid their tab... they say \"yes, with cash\". She comes back to us (mind you making scene in front of the patio) saying it is \"impossible\" that there was no money in it, assuming we stole it. Coming from a table full of servers we discussed that we would never accuse a table and track back steps before throwing accusations around...well what do you know, the money was on the floor. How did the manager handle it? He simply stated he would talk to her. I have never felt so offended and appalled by how we were treated. It is called customer service. Not only did she do that, but as other guests would leave she would lean out the patio while they were walking to their cars asking if they paid their tabs. Just very unprofessional. She then brings back our checks but one booklet has three tabs in it and she says the cash amount given was insufficient because she forgot a tab... at this point I thought it was a joke. We all gave her enough money, but at this point I felt she wouldn't get a tip because clearly she did not deserve one and pocketed the money, with our manager fed up, he took care whatever needed to be paid for because he just wanted to get out of there. I have never tipped lower than 20% even if the service was bad, knowing that everyone has their days. But being accused of stealing while trying to enjoy a nice evening is uncalled for. Her demeanor was awful and the whole transaction had me sick. I will not be attending this Zipps in the near future.",

    "text": "Seat yourself restaurants, especially sports bars during large sporting events like March Madness, make me uncomfortable. I hate hawking tables waiting for people to leave so I can jump in the booth while they are bussing the table.   After 8+ hours of watching March Madness at home on Saturday, my husband and I decided to venture up to Zipps in Scottsdale to catch the second half of the last games of the day. Luckily despite the crowd and having to seat yourself, we got a table within five minutes or so of arriving. Our waitress was very nice and even when she got my order wrong, she fixed it quickly and apologized for it.  We had the chicken nachos which I didn't care for too much because they use shredded chicken and I prefer the pieces of chicken meat. My husband had a slice of pepperoni pizza (described as just OK by him) and I had the chicken caesar foccacia with half onion rings (for my husband) and half french fries.  If the menu hadn't said my sandwich was supposed to be on foccacia, I would have never guessed. It came out as a wrap cut in five pieces and it was almost impossible to eat as everything kept falling out.  The onion rings and fries were forgettable...supposedly the fries are fresh cut, but I didn't get that sense.  Thankfully prices are incredibly moderate and for our food and 2 32 oz domestic drafts ($4 after 8 on Saturdays), our bill came to $29 without tip.  It looks like Zipps has a pretty decent happy hour and also runs nightly specials after 8 pm.  There are TVs throughtout the inside and on the patio, so it is a good place to catch sports...they had two different college games on that we could see plus the Suns game. I will go back to drink some beer, watch sports, and play shuffleboard (or shufflepuck as it is called in Ohio), but not for the food.",
