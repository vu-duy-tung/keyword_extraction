It was the worst $40 dollars I have spent on food ever. The carnitas tacos were okay but the carne asada was flavorless which I never knew could be possible. Fry's carne asada was better than that. Now the barbacoa, my fiance liked his so I tried mine I regretted it right away. I didn't even take another bite. I gave it to my fiance who took a bite and said gross that's nothing like mine. How does that even happen? Seriously. We had chicharrones and micheladas which was good but man what a disappointment. A place with Taco in the name and they couldn't even get that right. Needless to say never listening to that friend who recommended this place they have lost their credibility.",

The tortillas are really good, homemade with great texture. Salsa has a nice smokiness and def has a little kick.   But the real big issue was the service. Couldn't get a napkin or a refill on water. Servers were just chit chatting in the back with no regard for their customers.   You also have to grab a key to use the bathroom which is behind the building and all the way around the back. Basically you're walking down an alley to get there and there was zero toilet paper.   On top of having to pay for parking the whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended). The food was good but still wouldn't put it in the pantheon of great tacos we have in the valley and really isn't worth the hassle and the poor service.",

The staff was great! The service and ambiance is great. I read some complaints about the meat ratio. But, I don't expect a ton on \"street tacos\". I thought the ratio was fine. The corn tortillas were really good and fresh.   However, we ordered the chips, salsa and guacamole. They told us they were out of guacamole, but we could do the chips and salsa if we would like. Sure! No problem. Except the still charged us for the \"chips, salsa and guacamole\". Still, not that big of a deal. That is rookie employee mistake.  10 min later, they start serving guacamole again. Never bothered to bring us any, even though we paid for it. I feel that is bad coaching.   Margarita was good! Defiantly had tequila in it!!! You could taste it, for sure. I get them OTR, because I like paying form more than ice. I have never had this much ice in a OTR margarita.  We will go back, once they work the kinks out. I defiantly think you should give it a try.",

I called them the poltergeist tacos because the immense amount of fat in them reminded me of the thing that crawled out of the guys mouth in the sequel to the Poltergeist movie. In other words: completely repulsive. The place was busy and we had already waited an obscene amount of time so we couldn't be bothered to send them back although I did take a pic of the fat after pulling it out of my taco. Gross!!!

Don't be surprised if you have one and end up having to order more. That's what happen to me on my very first visit here. The Skirt steak flavor is really that good!

    "text": "Chef Aaron Chamberlin & I have had a somewhat lackluster relationship over the years.  I've visited Chef Chamberlin's other Phoenix creations (Phoenix Public Market Cafe & St. Francis) with mixed results.  Chamberlin certainly has a penchant for beautiful adaptive reuses of old buildings, but the food more often than not has left me underwhelmed.  In Taco Chelo, Chamberlin is making his first venture into the Mexican food realm inside a building on Roosevelt Row that most recently housed Flowers Beer & Wine (a craft beer & wine store that I dearly hope will reopen again nearby someday).  I don't always observe Taco Tuesday, but with a new taqueria just a few blocks from my apartment, I decided this Tuesday at happy hour was the right time.  As of my first visit here, the restaurant had been open for just barely a month.  You'll find it on the southeast corner of 5th Street & Roosevelt inside the old Flowers building (now part of a growing adaptive reuse complex called The Blocks).  Taco Chelo takes up about half the space that Flowers Beer & Wine once did, and the space is a hip modern urban neighborhood design that dreams are made of.  An absolutely gorgeous array of exposed brick, gold trim throughout the ceiling, wooden tables and seating, as well as turquoise hues throughout the bar area.  You'll also find beautiful art on the wall courtesy of artist Gennaro Garcia.  The space is completely unrecognizable from the Flowers days, but in this case I mean that as a compliment.  Inside there's seating for close to 30 (including the bar) & probably room for 40-45 more in the picnic table seating area outside.  They will most definitely need to get more shading for the outside before summer hits, but the foundation is solid.  Here you order at the front register helpfully marked with a Taco sign, grab a number, & sit wherever you want.  Dining solo for happy hour, I saddled up to the bar.  The menu at Taco Chelo (co-created by Chamberlin & chef Suny Santana) is somewhat limited, but concise & easy to digest.  You've got 4 apps, 5 tacos, 2 salads, & 1 dessert to choose from on the food side.  On the drink side it's more diverse with a fairly wide array of cocktails, beers, wines, & non-alcoholic drinks.  I haven't had mezcal in ages, so I started things off with their Mezcal Paloma.  Lime, ginger, bitters, grapefruit soda, and of course the mezcal itself.  I think they threw in a little house spice mix in there as well for an extra kick.  A very pleasant refreshing beverage to start with a spicy tartness to boot.  For the apps, most are ones you find at most sit down Mexican joints anywhere.  Chicharrones however are somewhat unusual to see on a menu so I grabbed those.  Basically fried pork rinds covered in cotija cheese and chimayo chili mix, with sides of guacamole and Cholula hot sauce.  Mine came with ten pieces in all.  Super crunchy (sometimes rock hard) & messy, but a pretty good vehicle for the guac.  The cheese & spices also work well here (that is of course if you can keep them from flying everywhere).  Now then, this is Taco Tuesday isn't it?  And I was feeling particularly ambitious today.  Taco Chelo's five taco offerings include:  Vegetable, Fish, Carnitas, Carne Asada, & Beef Barbacoa.  Although I'm disappointed they don't offer Al Pastor or Lengua tacos yet, I decided to give all five current varieties a try by ordering one of each.  For those wondering about the veggie, just know that there's a ton of mushrooms in this version.  Mushrooms aren't my thing so I wasn't a fan of their veggie taco, but you might come to a different conclusion than I did.  As for the rest of the tacos, I was mostly impressed.  The tortillas are made fresh by the staff for each order & the meats were quite delicious.  The Barbacoa fell a little flat for me but the Carnitas, Fish, and Carne Asada tacos were perfect.  After all that food, I had just enough room for their one & only dessert.  Their Tres Leches cake dessert is about twice the size of a hockey puck & topped with almonds and orange slices.  Its served cold with a smooth creamy texture, which certainly helps to soothe your mouth after all those spices from earlier.  The flavor profile overall was respectable, though not spectacular.  Total cost for all the food and my drink including tax and tip came to about $45.  First impressions?  A fantastic space and neighborhood hangout with decent (at times great) food & drink options.  My biggest beef is really what's missing from the menu.  Horchata?  Al Pastor?  Lengua? Nowhere to be found.  Even the most basic taqueria should have those offerings (in my humble opinion).  Its early yet so maybe that will be on the menu in due time.  For now, its worth a look if you're curious & definitely a great hangout spot for small groups.  With so much great Mexican food throughout Downtown, its not easy to compete.  Taco Chelo has potential.  Potential I hope they'll be able to fully exploit.",

    "text": "Taco Tuesday Success! After a fun day at the Botanical Gardens we decided to continue with our awesome day with some tacos. I've been dying to try this spot since they opened. What a perfect day to stop on Taco Tuesday. We were greeted immediately and since we hadn't been in before we were shown where to order and told we could sit wherever we liked. The space was so inviting and great decor. After looking over the menu we decided on chips and salsa which also came with some amazing guacamole. I could have ate it all by itself . I also ordered a carnitas taco, beef barbacoa taco, and our cashier let us know about the chicken taco they had on special for $2 for taco Tuesday so we did that as well. So glad she let us know! The tacos were so flavorful, huge portions, and came picture perfect . I loved how they came with a small side of extra salsa, cucumbers and limes. My son who is pretty picky when it comes to tacos  LOVED the beef barbacoa and red salsa. We enjoyed our lunch on the patio which was well shaded, and cool vibes. I like that they left the street art on the wall of the flower shop that previously inhabited the space. The prices were great and we left so full and happy for just under $12. I wish they sold the green salsa because I would've loved to take some home to my husband. I was told that they do sell the tortillas though. We will definitely be back. I'm thinking every time we're downtown. Thanks for a great meal and wonderful service. You guys rocked it!",

There is not a lot of seating inside, but if you wait a bit I'm sure you will be able to find a table outside by the time your food starts arriving.   I was originally planning on ordering three tacos, but saw some tamales on the specials menu and decided to switch my order to two tacos and a tamale.   I got one veggie taco, which was okay but not amazing. My second taco was the Fish, which was my favorite part of the meal. Unfortunately, because it was my favorite, I decided to save it for last and by then it was no longer hot and crispy. So I recommend eating your fish taco first! The tamale I got was cheese and pepper, which was also tasty but nothing special.   To start we ordered the chips and guacamole, which also comes with two salsas. I enjoyed all of the dips but was not amazed by the chips. I was also sad to learn that they do not do refills for the chips, which is a little disappointing considering that places with free chip service do refills.",

I almost freaked out because my tortilla was green and it made me hesitant to try but they were great.  -My friend had the flour tortilla barbacoa tacos and mentioned that they were really good as well.  -I had the blended margarita and it was good but I must warn you it is strong!

Every detail is special and the atmosphere is picture-perfect. The only thing I don't like is the counter-service, but just because this place gets so busy!  I ordered the asada, carnitas and fish to get a good spread. Surprisingly, the fish was my favorite. The crisp, freshness was impressive (coming from someone who doesn't usually eat fish).  The drinks are also pretty good. The sangria is a favorite. Very refreshing! The Michelada was unique - kind of a bloody mary, beer fusion. I liked the spice!  Overall, I'm looking forward to seeing this place succeed in the Roosevelt District!",

The music is authentic and always on point, the decor fits the concept and feels like home. Next, the food! The tacos are just like I would get in Mexico. Handmade tortillas, fresh ingredients and amazing salsas !! The XXX salsa is my favorite. Lastly, the staff. They are always so welcoming and do well with names! (Big points in my book) the bartender missy is new and already a favorite. She's full of life and always keeps up on the drinks! The managers, Adrian and Sarah do a great job with the staff. They lead by example and are always happy to go the extra mile for their guest. So basically if you're downtown or not, go to Taco Chelo. You won't regret it.",

The food was extremely lack luster. You can get more flavorful meat from Food City. I'm not sure what the idea was behind this restaurant, but perhaps they can create a more flavorful marinade or at the very least brown the carnitas. Maybe don't squirt globs of cream on my fish taco? I probably won't go here again. Habaneros makes a much better platter that blows this place out of the water.   I wish you the best in your taco experiences. I tried the carnita, carne asada, and fish. Bland, just very meh.",

The decor and artwork inside is amazing (huge Gennaro Garcia fan) - the staff was all so friendly and helpful - and the food was delicious. I am a big taco fan and these didn't disappoint. Everything tasted homemade, fresh and authentic. Salsa/guac was great - my sangria was so refreshing and my tacos (carne asada and pork) were awesome. Also, I think my new favorite way to eat a taco is quesadilla style. WOW. Highly recommend the \"quesadilla taco\". The shell was so crispy, cheese was melted and pork was tender and flavorful. YUM. Can't wait to come back! Gracias, Taco Chelo.",

    "text": "In Phoenix, there's no shortage of places to get exceptional tacos. You could blindfold yourself, walk 10 feet in one direction and trip over a place that makes above average Mexican food compared to most of the country. With that being said, I like Taco Chelo. I can't say it's the end all be all destination for what it offers, but it's definitely a place worth trying.  First, I'll say that it warms my heart that they have an employee dedicated to making fresh tortillas right in front of where you order. It primes you for the entire product, because a place that puts that much care into one aspect of their food has to be considerate of all other parts. I ordered a few carne asada tacos, and I was pleased with what I got. The meat is cooked more tenderly than some other places I regularly visit, and that added an interesting layer to the experience. They come with the regular fixings of guac and onions with cilantro, with a few lime wedges on the side and a ramekin of salsa. My personal preferences for tacos tend to lean more towards having the pronounced acidity of the lime juice and some more heat from the salsa. I didn't exactly get that with these tacos. And while they do have Cholula bottles on the tables, that stuff doesn't add the kick that I like. On a side note, one of my dining companions said that the fish tacos are the best she's tried in Phoenix, and I'll mention that to be fair.  It was not bad food by any means, it's just what they're going for maybe doesn't completely align with my tastes in their culinary art.  The staff was friendly and helpful, and water is plentifully available from a larger decanters around the store. They have a bar there, but it's not the kind of place where I would likely drink. If you like a margarita with your tacos, go nuts. I think this place definitely adds value to the neighborhood, and it has food worth eating. So get in there while it's new and hot.",

Starting from the friendly girl who I ordered my food from to the fresh chips and guacamole to the tacos I was amazed. The food here is so authentic and so fresh, it seemed like the chips and taco shells were all home made which is hard to come by at restaurants nowadays. If you are in the area come here. If you want some real tacos come here. If you want cheap crappy food this is not the place. This is the place to go when you want authentic Mexican food with good service.",

    "text": "Like so many #DTPHX locations, there was a lot of hype surrounding Taco Chelo and I fully admit that I was eagerly anticipating it's opening myself. However, I can now tell you that once the adrenaline wore off and the Downtown enthusiast in me had a chance to put things in perspective, I had a very different impression.  First and foremost this is an establishment that's certainly catering to it's primary demographic: Hipsters. The Roosevelt Row Art District was built for Hipsters so there's not much of a surprise there. However, I feel that it does come through in the food as well. You often get the impression that the food has been toned down, or altered to accommodate less familiar pallets. Tortillas are home made but that's about all I can say for the authenticity of the cuisine.  In addition, everything just feel a little gimmicky and even stereotypical in some ways. As if it's trying to be everything a Mexican restaurant \"should\" be  *Micheladas are served but are completely watered down  *food is ordered at the counter to give the impression of a Taco Truck/Street Tacos  *Huge Frida painting on the wall for aesthetic  I'm fully aware that this is a Latino owned establishment and as a Latino myself I can say that I expected more in terms of flavor, tradition and authenticity. Running a business is hard and far be it for me to tell a business owner what the best approach is to succeed. This is just my personal opinion based on my experience.  Do I like Taco Chelo? Yes. I like the location and the atmosphere. I enjoy having a drink and quick bite to eat if I'm in the area. However, it's not somewhere I would go or recommend for Authentic Mexican food.",

We ordered the fish, carnitas, and carne asada tacos.  We preferred the carnitas and fish was pretty good too.  The carne asada was just a carne asada taco, nothing really stood out.  The reason it's just a-ok is the price. The serving size is pretty small. It's not much more then you'd expect with a street taco so like you'd need a lot to actually get full off of them.  I've been to numerous hole in the wall places and mexican grocery stores that have fresh tortillas so that's not enough to justify the price to me.  Can't say I'd be inclined to come back.",

    "text": "When I first heard of Taco Chelo I thought to myself \"do we really need another taco joint in downtown Phoenix?\" But then who doesn't like tacos and can ever get enough of them. What I love about Taco Chelo is the simple menu that they offer with well-crafted items and flavorful ingredients. The building resides right in the heart of Roosevelt Row arts district and instantly draws you in with its murals, brick wall, vibrant colors and its Mexican-inspired design. A collaboration of Chef Suny Santana and Aaron Chamberlin, Chelo is named for Suny's mother Consuelo. The outdoor patio area is fairly spacious but the inside is limited seating. There is a to-go ordering area with a high stand-up table you can wait at while waiting for your order. My favorite part of the building is the turquoise colored main bar and the cool lighting fixtures hanging from the ceiling. The menu is super simple which is perfect for an indecisive person like myself. For appetizer, I ordered the Chips and Guacamole. The chips were nice and thick and flavorful. They also have Chile-spliced chicharrones which looked delicious. The tacos are your basic street tacos and are quite tasty (and not too complicated either). I went all meat (Carne Asada, Carnitas, Barbacoa) and loved that they are doused in guacamole sauce. The Carnitas were my favorite of the three. Drinks include cocktails, agua frescas, wine and a variety of Mexican and local beers (they even have Tecate in a can). Taco Chelo isn't anything new, but it's located in a great spot and is a pretty solid place to stop in for your late night taco cravings.",

The idea is pretty similar to that of a Mexican food truck, but the options more limited; the burrito about half the size of what I'm used to at just under double the price.

There was ample staff but most were kinda just wondering around with their heads in the clouds, and the few customers at the bar either had empty drinks or hadn't gotten to order at all. Salsa and gauc served jn very small ramekins.   I don't see myself returning; there are far too many taco joints in the phx to just have mediocrity.",

The carnitas tacos were so greasy that when I picked them up they streamed a heavy flow of grease back to the plate. I tried the costra taco which was the special. What was promised to be \"carmlized cheese\" was instead burnt cheese with about three pieces of asada.   The chips are store bought and not made in house which is sad because they could make bomb chips since they make the corn tortilla in house. Missed opportunity.   Typically I would get a chicken taco. That's my normal go to. They unfortunately don't offer anything in the white meat variety. But they have a veggie and fish option.   Really not a good experience and really don't understand the hype. You'd be better off getting a street taco just about anywhere else.",

The tacos were plain, nothing bad, nothing mind blowing. I think a 3-4$ taco should be better than ok. The drinks were suuuuuper strong! You could really feel them.

I asked the bartender what is up with your guy's fly problem he sipped n chuckle laughed n said I know that's why we have the doors closed now ?? Look I get it a couple insects flying around no problem .. but 20 plus ??? Now y'all need to get that together !! How hard is it too buy the lamps or that insect plug thing.. shoot anything geeesssh ! 2 stars for the food not the management or owners they get Zero.Zero Just too bad man I would love to try their whole menu but I just can't with the fly posse that run that place not the owner !",

House margarita was ok, but had too much ice overflowing out of the glass. We first sat down at a side table left of the front entrance. Several flies were there. We waited until two seats at the far left of the bar became available. We sat down and waited for the bartender with the tat and glasses to wipe the counter. I then asked him to wipe the counter. He with did not hear me or was too busy. 17 minutes later still not wiped. Our food arrived and was placed on top of what the prior guests left. Disgusting!! Tiny cups for salsa!! Oh I forgot to mention the parking meter a block away ($3.00). I did not receive a receipt and on the way home remembered \"what happened to my chips, avocado, and salsa!!! SMH! $30.41 and $26.06 with a very generous tip on both receipts!!! Service was below standard. I hope the owner reads my review and experience on Saturday as well as others. You guys owe me a chips, avocado, and salsa!!!",

I went the first week they opened and it was clear they had a lot of kinks to iron out, the next time I went was about 3 weeks later and things were running much smoother.  The food is good but a bit overpriced for the portion you receive. I appreciate that the tortillas are made in-house, and when I asked for additional salsa it was happily provided. I wish they had bigger salsa portions or even a bar for the chips and salsa because a little condiment cup isn't enough when you're eating tacos and chips. The margaritas are great!! I would come here just for that, they're strong and delicious whether you order the classic or flavored versions. All in all it's a must-try.",

We tried the chilaquiles, the huevos rancheros, the breakfast tacos, chips and guacamole, pinto beans, Carne Asada and barbacoa tacos. Love love love a good homemade tortilla and these were amazing. The beans were authentic and bursting with flavor, the red sauce and salsas had just enough heat. My daughter who is dairy free was pleased that the menu had dairy free, vegan and gluten free options. Final comment, I'll be honest, unfortunately compared to everything else we had, the guacamole was lackluster and small, nonetheless a small guac won't keep us from coming back, we absolutely loved everything else!",

One of the guys working here literally looked so miserable and was unhelpful and rude. I'm here on vacation and I asked for a glass of water and he pointed to the water jug on the side of the bar and looked at me like I was an idiot as if I knew it was there. He also yelled at the crowd for not being in a straight line and asked everyone to make a line out the door in the heat (which is fine I get it things need to be in order) but I just think he could've been a little nicer about it. There were flies everywhere in the outdoor seating it was so uncomfortable that when we finished our first round of drinks we left.",

Taco Chelo doesn't disappoint in either. The indoor/outdoor space is perfect for the March weather! The murals, artwork and finishes give it a great feel. I thought the prices were fair for what you got, but if you are hungry go ahead and over order! We had the fish tacos, vegetarian tacos, carne asade quesadilla, an excellent salad, chips, salsa and guacamole....they have two types of salsa caution one is hot! Everything we ordered was fresh, made to order and tasted great. Our two children were asking for 2nds! There were plenty of vegetables included as well.  I would highly recommend Taco Chelo. Easy to get to as it is right off the 1-10 and 7th Street. Be prepared to wait a little bit which is what you want in a restaurant that serves fresh food! Congratulations Aaron on another great spot!",

They also have the best jamaica I've ever tasted anywhere by FAR.

I am one super duper picky taco eater and these tacos were up to standard.  I ordered the Chicarones which paired nice with the guacamole and hot sauce that all fall under the same price, no guac extra here! They were crispy and topped with Oxaca cheese I would absolutely order again, try them out for yourself and find out why I reccomend it!  The fish taco was my favorite and with the pickled red onion, it paired famously! The fish was crisp and fresh, shoulda ordered 2!  The carne asada taco was also very tasty and not too busy. The cilantro and chopped onion complemented the meat and didn't over power the meal. Thumbs up for both!  Next go around I must try the tres leches and of course, my favorite meal: margaritas!",

    "text": "First time in Phoenix for work and my team and I decided to grab dinner at Taco Chelo. We walked in and were very surprised by how small and intimate the space were. At first I was a little skeptical but there was absolutely no reason to be!! We ordered some chips, guacamole and salsa for appetizers and 4 tacos each (fish, Barbados, carne asada, and the other meat one on the menu lol). We also had 3 margaritas each. Needless to say the food was really good and the margaritas hit the spot! After a long day at work the music and the ambiance in the little restaurant brought us even closer as a team as we shared some great personal stories over good food and drinks. Will definitely recommend if in downtown Phoenix.",

I did not enjoy the salad that much. The greens were just lettuce - I would have enjoyed mixed greens more. The dressing was nice and light and tangy. However I wish the fish was more flavorful and that the outside was crispier and the breading less doughy. When I dunked the fish in salsa it tasted much better.  Also the doors were open and a lot of flies were bothering us!",

    "text": "Taco Chelo is a little taqueria that recently opened up in that uber-cool area of Roosevelt. You know that neighborhood where all those giant apartment buildings mysteriously popped up overnight and look over a strange mixture of tiny homes that are either business-operated or completely abandoned? Yeah, that's the place. Graffiti is welcome. Parking is not. But Taco Chelo fits right in just fine. And it has a St. Francis connection to boot.  They had only been open for about a week when my girlfriend and I visited, so I was surprised to see a line going out the door this early in the game. But a lot of that has to do with the setup. Chelo has a little bar, but for food, they're shooting for the good ole' \"order at the counter\" approach. If you walk in through what appears to be the front door, you'll be very confused, as it's actually the exit. The beeline starts around back. It's a bit weird.  Given the layout of the restaurant, I'm not so sure if this is the best idea and I wouldn't be surprised if they eventually abandon it - especially if they want their servers earning tip money. It just felt like kind of a mess.  The menu is fairly simple, with a few appetizers and traditional street tacos that fall somewhere in-between taco truck prices and hoity-toity taco prices. They might want to update their website, because the big bowl of guac pictured on their menu isn't quite an accurate representation of the actual teaspoon-sized serving in a plastic cup that you actually get. Nevertheless, their guacamole was excellent, or at least what little of it I was actually able to try. Their quesadilla, although much smaller than what you're probably accustomed to, was also a respectable starter.  The menu on their website states that their tacos come with lime, but ours did not. My girlfriend had to cut through the line to request them, which they had to retrieve from the bar. In terms of their flavor, it's sort of a mixed bag. We both found the carnitas to be a bit too dry, while the barbacoa was just so-so and pretty much comparable to what you'd find at any run-of-the-mill taco place. The asada was actually a bit surprise, having a nice smoky flavoring that I wasn't expecting. We would have been better off just ordering a plateful of those.  When we left, the line was even longer, so clearly many people are very eager to try this place. And given their whole trendy and lively setup, I'm sure they'll do just fine. But to put it bluntly, it's really nothing groundbreaking. Everything you can find here can also be found within spitting distance. But prices are reasonable and the food is mostly decent, but as a few other reviewers have noted: Competition is stiff.   Check them out.",

    "text": "I've been waiting for so long for this place to open, finally went today and didn't have a great experience. It's really hard for a place that sells alcohol to be counter service. My friend and I wanted to leave our tabs open so we could easily order additional food and margaritas. Unfortunately this couldn't have been further from the truth. We ended up waiting in line at the counter, to be told we had to order at the bar, then at the bar they told us we couldn't order food. It was very confusing, and the lady helping us made it seem like it was our fault, but we were just doing what we were told.   Then many of our orders came out wrong. We kept having to remind the employees what we were missing from our order. I assume this will get worked out as they continue.  If you're a vegetarian this probably isn't the place for you. They only have one vegetarian taco and there are no substitutions (I'm picky and hate mushrooms, so I was bummed about that). However, my meat-eating friends liked their food. Also the margaritas were pretty good. I'd maybe come back if they went away from counter service. I love margaritas but don't want to have to wait in line and close out a tab every time just to get one.",

    "text": "After seeing Taco Chelo featured on DTPHX's Instagram, I was intrigued and decided to check it out with some girlfriends for taco Tuesday.  Located in the Roosevelt district, we thought parking would be challenging but it wasn't, we found several open meters near Bliss/Rebar and walked.  The space is very well done, the ambiance is perfect for the area. It has a similar vibe to Joyride Taco, though a little less hipster and a little more urban. There is both indoor and outdoor seating available, but the space is on the smaller side. While we were able to snag a picnic table outside right away, others didn't appear to be so lucky.  The restaurant is counter service so we waited in a pretty long line to order, even at 7:30. I ordered a quesadilla, the taco chelo salad and chip & guac, whereas my friends ordered a quesadilla and carne asada tacos. Everything was delicious and fresh except the salad (pictured). The ingredients were all cut in different sizes which made it hard to eat and the overall flavor was just blah.   The portions are small. The tacos and quesadillas are made on street taco sized tortillas, so if you're hungry know you'll want to order more than one. That being said, the prices I felt were reasonable.  I'm looking forward to going again and trying the tacos and beans!",

The vibe was cool, it's small inside with a nice patio. For it to be a taco stand with a pretty basic menu the tacos just weren't worth all the effort. I asked for their 3 most popular which were fish,steak and pork all just ok. My friend had the veggie and fish she sd the veggie was better so there's that.",

The tacos were super hot and the tortillas were great. Unfortunately, the beans weren't hot. There's no way they were up to temp. The Chelo Salad had great flavors but the amount in my bowl was way different than other bowls coming out. I also noticed that my half filled salsa, guac, and chips didn't compare to my neighbors full order 15 minutes later. The servers were either super nice or less than thrilled, it depended on who you dealt with. Ups and downs that hopefully get worked out. Most importantly- portions should be consistent and food should be hot.",

A small menu provides some very delicious options. There are daily specials available to change things up. I was a little disappointed that there were no chicken tacos available, but the ones I ordered (fish, barbacoa, and carnita) were all delicious. Also enjoyed a margarita during happy hour, which for the price was fair, though if the size is the same any other time I wouldn't invest. Overall a nice routine place to drop by, but not anything outstanding. Go if you have a chance, but don't go out of your way.",

I tried the fried fish carne asada and barbacoa tacos. No seasoning at all. Even the salsas that were on the tacos didn't bump up the flavor at all. The carne asada was probably the best flavored but it was just grill flavor. The corn tortillas were really good seemed like they were made fresh. The margaritas were very good. I feel for 3.50 a taco there are better options in the Phoenix area.",

Waited about 30 minutes for food, which we expected, but we were very hungry. The staff noticed and kindly brought us flan on the house. It wasn't your standard flan, but more of a panna cotta texture, it was good. We can't wait to be back (sans kids) and try some of the other options.

This place is small just like most places in DTPHX. I was lucky enough to snag some seats at the bar. The service as great as expected. We had so much fun chatting it up with the bartenders. Their playlist was on point the entire night. They were playing so much Ozuna, Mana, Shakira, Nicky Jam, Plan B. I loved it. I didn't want to leave. Not to mention, Taco Chelo is so aesthetically pleasing. Gennaro Garcia, the artist who decorated the restaurant, paid such attention to detail and really knocked it out of the park. From the Frida Khalo mural to the vibrant neon sign that reads \"Taquero Mucho\" to the Spanish sayings written on every chair. It's beautiful.  There's always a few things I look for in mexican restaurants and this place has hit all of them. Being from Mexico has made me pretty picky and judgmental. I rarely try anyone's guac but this place has me addicted to theirs. The carne asada is how it should taste. I've been looking for carne asada that tastes as great as theirs. The corn tortillas are handmade and cooked to perfection. The flour tortilla on my carne asada quesadilla was just the right amount of crispy. The fish taco comes with a spicy crema, pickled onions, and cabbage. Do not skip out on it!!!! They have a few different salsas but the fire roasted one is by far my favorite.   I'm so glad they chose to have mezcal. I don't see a lot of places with mezcal cocktails. The Mezcal Paloma was very refreshing as was their Tecate Michelada served in super cute Taco Chelo mugs.   FYI they aren't selling their mugs YET. The bartenders let me know the artist made a very limited amount but in time they'll have them for sale they believe along with T-shirt's. Nearby parking is limited. Also, they have one of those community bathrooms around the corner just ask the cashier for the key.   The menu is small but it speaks volumes with the flavors of the meats and salsas. Suny Santana did an outstanding job. Thank you so much for my new favorite restaurant.",

The servers are super cool and quick to help, seating is first come and i recommend if you're are in a group to have someone wait in line while you grab a table.

If you're a taco snob from Deep South Texas where street tacos are a religion and dining at a taqueria is like attending mass, then this place isn't for you. It's not a gringo taco place either but there's absolutely no reason to pay $14 for 3 tacos and beans unless you're ok with paying for the trendy Roosevelt Arts District venue. If you want a tastier taco with the same side of trendy and high prices then opt for Gallo Blanco in the Garfield District instead. The menu selection and bar will keep you more entertained there anyway. The service here is lackluster. Servers had a flat affect at best. Finally, the worst part of this trip was the charro beans. They mix them here with escabeche. Normally, I'd be overjoyed but I couldn't get past the extreme saltines of these charro beans. I couldn't even finish more than 3 spoonfuls. For street tacos at the best price, you still can't beat Charlie's in the Melrose District. And even then, meh. Man, I miss Texas!",

Had the green chicken tamal which had a good moist masa and great green chile flavor but very light on the chicken. The asada tacos were the perfect seasoned grilled meat, the fish taco was a big chunk of fish, and the quesadilla had that mexican griddle flavor and perfectly salted cheese. The horchata had real authentic rice grains and was also perfectly made not too sweet or cinnamony or milky. Yum can't wait to come back and try the other meals.",

Went to Pop n Tea bar after for desert (left there still hungry and poor too by the way and ended up having second lunch at The Stand). The decor is cute - loved the playful signage and details. Went on gay pride weekend so the area was quite festive and the nice weather brightened up the space.",

I did enjoy the homemade tortillas but the carne asada lacked flavor and the amount of meat in the tacos was scant. I ordered 3 tacos and felt very unsatisfied after waiting 15 minutes in line to order and about another 15 for my tacos to arrive. Though I wasn't 100% satisfied with the food, the employees were very friendly and quick to clean tables after a party left. I recommend coming here if you're not very hungry and are just going out for a quick bite and drinks!",

Although the tortillas were really good, the meat severely lacked seasoning and at $3.75 per taco, you expect them to at least taste better than your neighborhood Filibertos, Vaqueros, etc. The chips and salsa were great, but not worth returning for. Very disappointing considering how everyone raved about this place.",

It had a casual ordering system where you wait in line, order, pay and take a number back to the table of your choosing. Not sure if it's always this way or only during first fridays.  My girlfriends and I grabbed a seat outside, next to all the street action. Given the night it was, it was quite loud and crowded but we expected nothing less. Our food come out shortly. I ordered chips with salsa and guacamole, a fish taco and a veggie taco. The salsas were really good, one mild and one pretty spicy (verde), and the guacamole had a great flavor to it. The chips were OK, I have definitely had better. We finished them all quickly lol. The fish taco was definitely my favorite! Fish was cooked well and served with a great sauce. The veggie taco I also enjoyed, it had a good amount of beans in there for protein. The best part is the tortillas they are served on, not sure if they are house-made but they sure taste like it!   One of the ladies ordered the jamaica drink and let us all try a sip. It was so refreshing! I loved it and will definitely order one for myself next time I'm in.",

It was once again fulfilling and the taste was out of this world. I enjoy the \"order yourself and find a seat\" style and the quickness that the wonderful staff brings the food. It's a convenient and classy, yet authentic and local favorite taco stop. I highly recommend.",

I like that. I like to see how it's made and what they do to prepare it. It didn't take long for them to bring my order out after a bit of confusion today, but I was not disappointed. I had a fish taco and three carne asada tacos. The carne asada is so moist and tender, juicy and delicious. Along with my food I had a nice little ipa and that washed down real good.

Hmmm I ordered a mix of tacos. If you asked me what was my favorite taco, I couldn't even remember the flavors... as they were lacking. In my opinion so many restaurants now are focused so much on their decor and \"hip\" look that they forget why people go to restaurants to start with : food! I guess I need to try something else on their menu next time.",

Ordering was super easy but it was hard finding seats (which is a good thing) I'd recommend maybe going on a week night if you want the full experience. We started with the chips and guac and it was really tasty and then our food came out shortly after and it was absolutely delicious. I got 3 tacos (Carne Asada, Barbocoa, and Fish) the fish was probably my favorite but each were super fresh and full of flavor. My Wife got a veggie quesadilla and the Taco Chelo salad and it was perfect, just the right amount of flavors and portion. We dined on the patio and the spring AZ night was the perfect match to go with our evening. We will definitely be coming back.",

We addressed this to the staff and they were very good and concern about our experience. They were to offer an apology and a dessert to make it up for it.

Today, they brought out my food after 20 minutes, then my boyfriend waited an additional 15 minutes for his food. He had to repeatedly go to the order counter to ask about it. Ultimately, I finished my food and he had to take his to go and they acted like it was no problem. Horrible customer service. Will not be back.",

We got a cheese, vegetable and Carne Asada quesadilla and they were just what we needed! They are small, like a street size. Food came out fast and everyone was pleasant. Don't wait for your order to be taken, walk up to the register by the kitchen and order yourself. This is a super chill spot. We enjoyed the food, the music, and the art! Nice patio set up outside too! I saw they have aqua frescas, but only had one flavor this night. Hope they are an all the time item there and they change flavors often or have more than just one flavor. So down to the nitty gritty....Nice job Taco Chelo. Hasta la proxima vez",

    "text": "The food is AMAZING! Had the chips, salsa and guac looks like the chips are made in house which makes them taste wonderful. The tortillas and handmade you can see the lady making them. I ordered a barbacoa taco, a carnitas taco, and a fish taco. Barbacoa was the winner. There are 3 salsas my favorite one was one that came with the chips had a cumin/lemony taste. It was perfect.   Now you're probably wondering why I gave it 3 stars. The reason for it is that their service is ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE. You walk in and no body greets you, you order at the counter on the far end of the restaurant under a sign that just says \"tacos\". The people are not friendly. The girl that took our order was very short and did not seem to care. The second person i spoke to was a girl behind the bar, I  asked where the restroom was and she told me \"i'll give you the key\" then said \"go outside past the other restaurant\" and walked off. I didnt know i needed to go out the front door or the patio door and when I asked which way she had already walked off. So i just went out the patio door and found my way to the restroom. The third person was a guy that gave us our food, we sat at the bar as there were no other seats available. When he dropped the food off he quickly turned around and paid no notice to my bf who waved his hand to try to get his attention. We needed salsa, limes, and salt. Come on its a taco! We need the toppings. We flagged another girl down and we got what we needed, this place could be sooo great if the service didn't suck.  We will be back for the food, hopefully they aren't as careless next time we go.   OVERALL: go for the food but don't expect good service.",

From the time we entered, the service was great, prompt, and refreshing. The tacos...AMAZING! The flavors were just right. The salsa had a perfect amount of spice and the margaritas....mmm good!   My only concern is having to walk down a sort of sketchy alley to access the bathroom at night. It didn't seem safe and there were no guards or employees around to assist anyone who didn't feel safe to walk alone.   All in all, Taco Chelo, I'll be seeing you again soon! Great tacos, great margaritas, and great service!",

I ordered a quesedilla which was like a mini quesedilla. I could have ate 10. It tasted OK. Next time I'll need to order much more as portion sizes are small",

    "text": "I've been to taco Chelo a few times and although I love their use of fresh ingredients, I can't say I love their food.   The best part of the place is their fresh tortillas, but sometimes you can't even enjoy the tortilla because it gets soggy from the excess juice laying around.   Food, to start, is pricy. It's suppose to be gourmet tacos but it doesn't taste so gourmet. The carne asada tacos are decent. I think it lacks seasoning. It's cooked right.. just missing flavor.  Fish tacos are okay, they really soft, I'm guessing it's cod? Whatever it is, it lacks texture and it feels like I'm just eating a light fried dough. They also garnish the hell out of this taco... probably to fill in the lack of fish texture. These taco seems to be too moist to enjoy if you let sit more than a minute.  I've had another taco when I first came in also. I can't remember which one so it probably wasn't great.",

The meat in all of tacos were cooked well, marinated well, and complimented all of the toppings perfectly.

    "text": "Nestled in the busy, booming area of downtown Phoenix, Taco Chelo has so much potential. The restaurant itself has personality -  from the 'instagram-able' decor and lighting to the cool, spanish music blasting on the speakers. It is a charming restaurant well suited for date night, birthday dinners and the like. Unfortunately, that's about the best part about it.   It is a cafeteria-style restaurant, and the staff is extremely limited. We dined on a Friday night, and my sister waited more than 30 minutes for her tacos because the server accidentally took the wrong order number from our table. When I pointed out that she has been waiting a while,  they were gracious enough to give us free tacos which we appreciated.   The food was nothing spectacular and for how much I paid (3.75 a taco) I thought it would be well worth it. I had a few bites of my carne asada and carnitas tacos and didn't finish the rest of it. The fish tacos were probably the best out of all of them - delicious slaw and crispy, perfectly cooked fish. The corn tortillas were made in house from scratch. I had a moscow mule which was pretty pricey (around $12 I believe).  Overall, I probably would not come back.",

    "text": "I know exactly how spoiled I am when it comes to the tacos that are abundantly at my fingertips in Los Angeles, but I've been impressed by Phoenix tacos in the past and wanted to give them another run in the form of Chelo Tacos. In short, they were good, but they didn't blow me away.    Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  The service and atmosphere at Taco Chelo are divey but comfortable, and I was well taken care of at the bar. The menu is straight forward, and I had my three tacos out in no time. Star.      Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  I fully expect to pay a premium for non-street tacos at a sit down restaurant, but even so the price tags that ranged between $3.00 and $3.50 at Taco Chelo were slightly higher than I expected. Enough to go docking stars? No given these were slightly larger than normal tacos, but it was a close one. Star.     Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  As others have pointed out, the handmade tortillas at Taco Chelo are a huge plus, but even with those in play I was a bit let down ... until I had my carne asada taco.   I don't know what Taco Chelo does to this steak or where they get it from, but it was firmly on bar with some of the better barbecue I've had anywhere in the country. The unique smokey flavor was out of this world and came together brilliantly in a taco complimented by some of Taco Chelo's salsas. Single Star.     Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Taco Chelo doesn't quite have the menu diversity nor the price points for me to make this my go-to PHX taco spot, but they're worth visiting for the tortillas and the carne asada. No Star.",

They make there own tortillas but that did not make up for the taste of the meat. The food really deserves 2 stars but the decor here is on point so I bumped it up a star.

Pork was also good, but overall it's not a meal I would find myself craving.  Salsas were great, and the margarita was excellent.  With all the hype, design, and work to have this place open in our neighborhood, I expected more on the menu.  You have $3.50 tacos, chips/salsa, and a couple other appetizer type foods that could rival a food truck - not a full service restaurant.  I can see us returning for happy hour and potentially a pre-dinner sort of situation.  If I want to have a real (full) meal, I've got a list of other places we can go visit for that.",

I'm not expecting it to be like $1, but damn, $3? Atmosphere is nice and there's outside seating as well. Alcohol is also served at this location! It's near a barcade, so if you get the munchies, it's right around the block. :) Don't think I would come here again if I came back to Arizona; it's a little pricey, but worth the experience.",

I liked the different flavors and the dressing was very lime tasting which mixed well with the greens. The fish was crunchy and delicious. Since it was happy hour I also had a margarita which was also great. The people beside me had tacos and they looked so good, I will definitely go back the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "I will start with Way Over Priced. I'm a neighbor of theirs and I was happy to see a new restaurant move into the neighborhood. And I'm a big supporter of my neighborhood. I gave them a try after they had time to open and work out some of the normal new restaurant bugs. I was still unexpressed with the product and service. And I thought the prices were too high for what I got. So I gave it a couple months and tried again. Still no change in service, product or prices. I tried a drink from the bar and I wondered if there was any liquor in it. I asked my friend and she thought the same. Recently as the weather got better, they started having live music. Again I'm a big supporter of the neighborhood and I know what it means to live downtown... But, the music needs to stop at 11pm. Those of us who live and work downtown, need to sleep. I called the restaurant and asked them to at least turn it down. The guy whom I spoke with said he would. Then it seemed to get louder. So thanks for the big middle finger Taco Chelo! Please be a good neighbor. The rest of your neighbors are trying real hard to support you.",

It has great lighting with cool decor. The bar area is nice. You can order your food and watch a game. We ordered a couple of margaritas on rocks for $6 and they were absolutely great. Bartender Kitty was very helpful and made those drinks delicious. My friend also got Mezcal mixed drink from the menu and he loved it too. The chips with salsas and guacamole were super fresh and crunchy. I wanted to take them home We ordered fish and carnitas tacos which were good. I only wish that they would have other tortillas because I don't like regular store brand corn tortillas. Also, this place is straw free! I love that!",

I am super stoked that there is an amazing taco joint in Phx that way I don't miss my native country. One of the owners is an artist as well and the are hanging in the walls as well as the one painted on one of the walls is awesome. This is place is a must if you love tacos and either I've in Phx or is visiting Phx. The food the ambiance and the art makes this place an amazing experience.

A manager came up to my friend and I with free shots of a local tequila new to Phoenix and the staff was also very friendly. You could stay a while at this spot, or just as easily be in and out depending on your schedule.",

    "text": "I first heard of this place thanks to a PBS show called plate and pour. My bf and I love tacos, we are lucky to live so close to our favorite taco spot. We were planning on being at downtown phx on Tues so decided to have dinner here. what a perfect day because Taco Tuesday! I really wanted to like this place, I was really looking forward to trying their chicharron. I had told a coworker about this place who tried it before me and told me yes the chicharrons are delicious. We ordered the taco specials, carnitas and chicken. For me the carnitas were a little too salty for my taste but the Salas sort of balanced that out. The quesadilla was delicious. We also ordered house margaritas which were good, just a little too much salt on the rim. We received our drinks, then our taco, then I waited for my chicharron. Waitress came by and asked if there is anything we were waiting on I said yes an order of chicharron, she said she'll bring it right out. Then I waited, and waited and waited... I was so bummed and disappointed. The same waitress passed us about 4x with other people's food. We had a timed meter so after 45min of waiting for my chicharron I finally got up and asked if I can have that money go towards 2 beers. However even that was a wait and the cashier never gave me a number she just said she'll bring it out. And we waited another 15min for our drinks and had to go put more quarters in the meter. Over all nice place, seems like a great spot for an after work dinner or lunch. I hope for better service next time. I am still eager to taste those chicharron.",

They also had other drink options ranging from alcoholic, to non alcohol like horchata, and even agua freska. I really want to try their horchata and agua freska next time!   Food: The fish tacos... GET IT! The perfect balance between a savory batter and a drizzle of sour lemon squeeze!!! The tortilla wasn't soggy and tasted warm and fresh! My friends loved the vegetarian tacos, so I deff want to try them next time. For meat eaters, they have that option too.

Service was the best I had ever had with taco joints!! Walked in looking unsure and stood for a minute to collect my thoughts, the bartender Missy, came up so welcoming and explained how things work here. After that I couldn't resist and found a spot at the bar where you get full service. If your at the tables, you'll order at counter and then get served drinks and food. I came in at the right time for happy hour (3pm- 6pm) & had food also which isn't on the HH menu but it was already at a reasonable price. Drinks were served timely, just like food. Both were great! Love how simple the menu is and you must get their Michelada, along with Carne Asada Tacos...such a great combo. The Manager Adrian is a great leader, he held a smile and great vibes for the whole time I was there...he also has great skills if you ever drop your EarPod in a tight spot. With a great boss there's great employees, thus why Missy is the bestest. She kept great rapport and suggested great things to do around Arizona. Go in and enjoy like I did!!!",

    "text": "Came here for lunch with a friend. We arrived at 1:00pm and were able to get a table inside. It has a nice interior and a patio in the back that would be great during cooler weather. I was greeted promptly and advised of how to order. You stand in line at the register and place your order and they give you a number and bring your food to the table. I'm not a real big fan of this style of ordering but the process did seem to go quickly. Since I was waiting on my friend I decided to order the chips/salsa/guacamole for $3.50. It was okay however I really wished there had been more guacamole. The salsas had a good flavor and none of them seemed to be really spicy. I ordered 3 tacos as I knew from reading the previous reviews that they were small. I probably would have been fine with just 2 (since I had been snacking on the chips) but I couldn't decide on which ones so I went ahead and went for 3. I ordered the fish, the carnitas, and the carne asada.  All are served with the traditional onions, cilantro, and limes. Hands down my favorite was the carnitas. I just wish there had been more meat in it. The little tablespoon or so just didn't fill up the corn tortilla it was in. The fish was okay but just had too much breading in my opinion. I prefer my fish tacos grilled and unfortunately they do not offer that option. And the carne asada had a good flavor but unfortunately I encountered a giant piece of fat/gristle in my 2nd bite of it and it kind of ruined it for me after that. They only serve bottled soft drinks and bottled iced tea (Pure Leaf) and if you want to add sweetener to your iced tea then you have to make do with their simple syrup from the bar which I despise. So at this point I doubt I will be back anytime soon as I thought the prices for each of the tacos was pretty steep ($3.50-$3.75 each) and I can think of a lot of other places to get street tacos at a better price.",

The line was out the door (to be expected- Friday evening AND it's a new restaurant) but we were able to snag a seat shortly after ordering. Drinks are a bit over priced in my opinion (canned Arizona sweet tea). Employees were friendly and attentive. I would recommend telling servers that it's not wise to tell a customer NOT to order something because of the assumed wait (fish tacos). I don't eat pork or beef and came there specifically for fish tacos hehe. We ordered 5 of them plus veggie tacos and they all came out rather quickly. They were very delicious! Would've missed out had I listened to the server (I'm sure she meant no harm) ;-)",

The concept is a sit down restaurant, however, you go to a counter at the back of the restaurant to place your order for wonderful specials (they were making tres leches last time I was in), chips with salsa and quac (classic), bomb ass tacos (smaller/serval bits tacos) and dranks on dranks.  So far the sangria has been my favorite. The sangria is sweet enough but not overall sweet. You can also order food if you sit at the bar instead of getting in line for food (lines can take a while during prime time).   Overall decor is colorful and modern with an awesome painting near the bar/large window area in front. The bar is an awesome place to sit for a while and grab a drink or food. For those interested, there is also a tv.  Food - awesome but tacos are slightly small. Decor - modern, fun and flirty Dranks - derriosiois Happy hour - hellll yeah EVERYDAY 3-6 (includes $ margs and sangria) Service - nothing by friendly and helpful  PS Bathroom is not in the same building as the restaurant (you need a key and it's a build over on the back that's connected by an alley)",

Carnitas were also really good with onion and cilantro. Pork was super tender. But the star of our taco feast, hands down, was the barbacoa beef taco. This 2 day slow cooked beef melted in your mouth. And so flavorful with a slight kick of heat. This was the best taco I've ever had. Nice surroundings and super friendly help.",

    "text": "A little Mexican restaurant located in the Roosevelt district. The space offers both indoor and outdoor seating. Seating is on the smaller side inside and they have the large style picnic tables outside. With the warm weather coming up it would be nice if there were some covers to block the sun and make it  less hot if dining outside. With that being said, the restaurant is counter service. The menu is pretty simple. They offer a few appetizers, street style tacos and salads. My husband and I ordered two fish tacos, two carne asada, cheese quesadilla, side of beans and chicharones. I thought the tacos lacked flavor and it was a bit on the bland side , but they weren't bad. It just didn't have that wow factor. The price of the tacos weren't to bad but I don't think it was worth 3.50. However the mini quesadilla we ordered was definitely not worth $2 . I did enjoy my pineapple Fresca. It was refreshing and not overly sweet.  The one thing I didn't enjoy was all the flies inside. Since they do leave the door open, there were so many flies and it was annoying trying to shoo the flies away while you ate. On the plus side, staff was friendly and service is fast . Your food comes out fast and it's nice not having to wait long to get your food. If you're looking for a quick bite then this is the place, but if you're wanting to sit down and dine, I would suggest going elsewhere. The foo",

Priced at $3+ they didn't come with enough meat and looked bare. The meats were ok but did not taste different in any way to have them stand out. The frijoles were missing something but were good, probably should have put them on the tacos to fill them. The chicharrons were good, extra crispy.   Would I come back?

We ended up splitting a chips, salsa and guacamole order for the table. The chips were actually very good, crispy and fresh without being overly greasy. The guacamole was good too, a plus since there were no onions in it because I hate onions. The salsa was decent, spicy and it was also the same salsa that accompanied our tacos that arrived shortly thereafter. I got a carne asada taco which I was pleasantly surprised with. The tortilla was sturdy and flavorful amongst all the carne asada and there  as avocado garnishing the top, once again without onions! Our drinks took a long time to arrive, but once they did they were good. I got the margarita, a good balance between salty and sweet. Not watered down either. Overall it was a pleasant meal, albeit a little pricy for regular tacos even on a taco Tuesday. We were disappointed they didn't do any taco Tuesday deals, hopefully they may change their ways in the future.",

The counter you order at just looks like the side of the bar. I ordered a fish taco, veggie taco, and chips and salsa/guac. The fish taco was yummy, good flavor and a nice crunch on the fish, the veggie taco was just okay. The veggie taco didn't have a ton of texture, just soft zucchini, beans, and pico, also they put arugula on it and it gave it a weird taste and again a soft texture that I really didn't like. The salsa was great but they all come in very small plastic cups and the portions are small. Would be hard to share with two people if both are fans of guac as the portion is teeny tiny. Nothing really special with those expect the guac was nice and chunky! With both tacos being 3-4 dollars I really expected more. Cute place with a lot of potential but as of now I wouldn't go back.",

It's not until you take the first bite and you get a burst of corn sensation that you realize you have underestimated the tortilla. Then the taco filling comes. It doesn't matter what filling you get the flavors are exquisitely developed. If you have the room, order the Frijoles a la Charra. It's a hearty pinto and bacon stew with well developed flavors and plenty of depth to go around, especially if you add the carnitas to it.",

It is order at the counter which I typically have a real aversion to, but after I ate, I couldn't hate on it because my food was so gooooood! We ordered tacos, chicharrones and horchata. The menu isn't big, but what was served was really delicious. I'm still thinking of the horchata, and it was the best I've had in a really long time, maybe ever. There were two things that I'd like to make note of, and they are the reason for minus two stars. First, some customers brought a dog into the restaurant, like actually inside. The employees were petting the dog and they were allowed to sit at their table inside the restaurant with the dog while they ate. Now, this was clearly not a service animal, and I don't even need to tell you how the Maricopa County Environmental Services Department feels about this. Big no no for me, I do not need pets where I eat my food. Secondly, the prices are pretty high! For our above mentioned food, we spent over $40. At $3.50 a taco, it adds up quick. There are a lot of good taco options in Phoenix that don't charge near as much, I was a little turned off.",

The fish taco and barbacoa were the only good ones. The carne asada meat was super fatty and super salty. The guacamole and chips were delicious as well. We got the jamica drink and it had no flavor what so ever. The lemonade drink was ok.",

    "text": "This was my first time I have been to Taco Chelo.  I decided to give your restaurant a try while dining in the neighborhood. I was excited to see that you had chicharrones on the menu but much to my surprise the chicharrones were not crispy or crunchy.  They looked to be days or months old being stored in a plastic container that I could see while I was dining.  Maybe you should try to cook them, when they are asked for instead of cooking them in the morning or mid shift & storing them in the container.  I could have got more crunch from a bag of chicharrones from the circle k. They were crunchless, tough to chew & had no flavor despite the cheese, guacamole & hot sauce served with it.  Recommendation, fry them up as needed & clean your floors & tables before seating your next customers.  Lastly, you definitely need to make sure & check your carnitas more thoroughly.  I found two bones in my tacos, you might want to invest in dental insurance for your patrons.",

We are seat at the bar people so we enjoyed the ambiance and my wife loves the pastel de 3 leches. Tortillas are great and salsas are good as well, the best part of our experience however was our bartender (Jose) He was friendly, attentive and extremely cordial. Thx Jose! Friendly service can sometimes make up for the lack of anything else!",
