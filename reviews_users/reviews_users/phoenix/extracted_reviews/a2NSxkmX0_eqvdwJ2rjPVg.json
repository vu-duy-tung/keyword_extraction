    "text": "Disappointed, this used to be my favorite Chinese restaurant.  I don't know if they were having sewer problems but there was a bad smell.  It definitely became stronger when I got closer to walking in to the restroom.  Now.......to the food.  For an extra $2.00 I substituted for the wonton soup.  It was a very small portion, only ONE shrimp and it was OK.  I ordered the Goo Goo Guy Pan (excuse the spelling.).The white rice was soggy and the sauce was too thin.  Before they brought me what I ordered, they brought me the wrong dish.  I asked them where the free hot tea was.  I was told that the machine was broken.  Machine, what machine?  I went there for lunch early and not many people were there.  I won't be back.",

We've found the Pinnacle Peak store to be a bit better overall than the Shea store, however, we were very disappointed in the Shea store after a take out order on 5/12/2013.    The quality of the food was not very good.  We ordered BBQ spare ribs...very little meat on the bones.  We ordered pork fried rice...very little pork and very little flavor.  We ordered shrimp in lobster sauce...very watery and little flavor.  We order orange chicken...very little chicken covered in bread, lots of fat and little flavor.  Not sure if there is new ownership or if they were having a very off day....",

We thought we would try this place because it's always busy and love Asian cuisine however, once we started eating it we were disappointed. We ordered the general tso's chicken and I am pretty sure it wasn't chicken. Each bite (between the two orders of it) was all gristle. If it wasn't all gristle it was a chunk of the cooked batter. Considering this is a dish that most restaurant's can nail down, I'm sure we won't be back to try the rest of the food. For the price of it, I would hope the quality of meat they use was higher than what we experienced in the two orders of chicken. My advice: maybe try the miso soup, it's probably less hard to ruin.",

Well, we chose a couple of entrees, orange chicken was very good, not soggy like some places but almost crispy. Very good. Sea bass was very tender. Liked the 4 seasons. Noodles were excellent.  Pretty much everything we tried was very good. Not sure about the price but seemed reasonable, especially considering the quality. Service was attentive without being over bearing. Very nice decor.   Would recommend. Want to go back on a Sunday when the cook is back to try the dim sum.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't reviewed Jade Palace before!  My husband and I go there often and love it.  We've been living in the area for 5 years and Jade Palace was one of the first restaurants we found that we both really liked.  The inside of the restaurant is very nice, and we've always had really great service.  The food is top notch!  We've never had a bad meal there.  My husband's absolutely favorite is the hot and sour soup, he is a total hot and sour soup snob and he loves this one.  I often stop there just to pick up a big container of it for him.  The crab rangoons are really good too, not greasy and lots of filling.  The General Tao's chicken is one of our favorites but the sauce is a little different than most Chinese restaurants.  I absolutely adore the mu shu chicken and anything in kung pao sauce is divine.   The fried rice is really delicious too; we always order it with beef.  My new favorite is the chow fun noodles house special (pork, chicken and shrimp.)  If you like lo mein try the chow fun for something different.  Its flat rice noodles.  The lunch specials are really awesome too.  I think they range from about $7-$11, you get your choice of egg drop soup or hot and sour, a main entree, fried rice, a spring roll, and a crab rangoon.    We get a lot of takeout from Jade Palace and the takeout orders are huge.  They also deliver.  Just a warning, anything marked spicy will NOT be spicy.  If you want it spicy ask them to make it extra hot.",

    "text": "For some reason this place has their Best Of reviews on plaques by the door. I've been here a couple of times at the behest of friends and both times, it's been miserable. Last time, we were a table of 10 so I forgive a lot if they are not specialists in larger parties. I was there with a friend and we were shown to the last booth in the back at 530P on a Wednesday. Our server was a middle aged gentleman and far from friendly. No attempt at upsell with cocktails or apps. I asked why they designate their egg rolls as NY egg rolls. Answer: because they have pork. WTF?  The 4 top of senior citizens next to us got the fried wontons and sauces as a complimentary app, we did not.  We did not get water refills and I had to ask to have hot tea refilled (which they charge for the initial fill).  Serving dishes come out warm and they offer only cold plates. Our food was cold within 5 minutes. Enter a table of 6 Asian people (3 children) and they are provided chopsticks and attentive service. It was assumed by our rude waiter that we were not adept at handling chopsticks and weren't offered any.  For two people, we ordered 4 dishes, not apps so any waiter would assume the tip would be decent. The  \"best of Phoenix\" lo mein is greasy. The spring rolls are passable. I didn't even want to try the mixed veg plate as it was swimming in oil. Fried rice was ok, very very bland.  Our waiter was so surly it was ridiculous even trying to get the bill. I am so annoyed my friend picked up the bill when the food was cold, and she tipped the server when  it was an exercise to get any service and we didn't get the same service afforded to others.    This place is terrible. Anyone who awarded this  'New York Style Chinese Cuisine\" or \"Best Lo Mein in Phoenix' should have their palate cleansed and tested before returning to work.  Overpriced. Greasy. Poor service. Rude.",

It looks very nice and they always look pretty full. I had a craving for some chow fun yesterday so I had the chance to try this tonight. I went in and ordered the House Special Chow Fun. That usually gives a decent representation of how dry or juicy the meat is. As an afterthought I asked for no green onions. This usually means ANY onion but not here. I waited for about 8 minutes and then received my order in a 4-stapled closed paper bag. Guess I shouldn't look in on it til I get home! When I opened it I was disappointed to see exactly one piece of bbq pork on top. Stingy. I also happened to notice a piece of green onion. Great. So I started digging to see what they graced me with (for $12.95). I had 4 shrimps, and 4 pieces of chicken and pork. What I did have were a huge abundance of white onions (see my picture) (strike one) and a container full of soggy broken chow fun noodles. Anyone who knows about chow fun noodles knows to not over cook them and most definitely they must be long. Strike two. The flavor was blah and this dish just did not compel me to immediately make a Thanksgiving reservation!! Perhaps I'm a food snob. I dont know. I've eaten a lot of Chinese food in Vancouver, LA and San Fran. Unfortunately this dish does not even remotely compare. Yes, I know I'm in Phoenix. Sigh. I'll probably take my kids for a meal and get a better idea of their capability. But my first impression really, really sucks. Sorry.",

Want to avoid the \"older\" crowd? Don't go at the \"early bird\" time. Idiots.   Food was really good, we ordered to go after reading reviews as I didn't think I could be nice to people who were being disrespectful of the \"older\" crowd. The New York style egg roll was to die for. I haven't had a good egg roll since I was in China. Street food over there is to die for! We ordered fried rice, which we really enjoyed as it wasn't a sodium overload like a lot of places. The chicken and broccoli was also very good. It is a really solid place, I would go back. I am just truly disgusted with other reviews to be honest. Yelp needs to clean house.",

Definitely give it a try, I think you'll be back! Also, it's always packed....on every weeknight or weekend that I've gone there. That says something!

The food on my last visit was not up to snuff. Every dish we ordered came out cold and the lo mein was overly greasy.  Yes, it's Americanized and you have to ask for chopsticks. You're in Scottsdale. Consider who lives around here. They're cooking for the neighborhood. Jade Palace is comfort food. You're not going to reach culinary heights, but you'll get dishes you know and love.  I just wish they didn't let them sit at the pass so long that they all came out cold.",

But this place had the greatest variety of spicy dishes so I thought we would give it a try, even though reviews were mixed.   They have two locations, we went to the one on Shea in Scottsdale. We arrived at 8:00 on a Saturday evening and it was very busy.  The tables were packed tightly together.  The waiter was Asian and seemed to have a limited command of English. He managed to spill a glass of water on my wife, and had to come back 4 times to find a bottle of wine that they were not out of.    However the food was better than expected and arrived quickly.  We ordered 2 Sichuan dishes, Hunan beef, and Peking duck. I asked for chili oil on the side and it didn't arrive until most of the spicy dishes were gone; the spice level without it was a bit bland. Plenty of garlic in them, and the Hunan beef had plenty of the black fermented beans.  The duck was quite tasty, the server rolled up the pancakes for us and brought extra plum sauce.   Would have given another star except for the service.  The manager did come over and apologized, then comped us the $60 bottle of wine.     Will I return?  Maybe. I will know better what to order and will plan to arrive well after the peak dinner hours if I do.",

I ask to ask our waiter where our food was and when it finally came out 15 minutes after the egg rolls, they forgot to put cashews on our cashew chicken.

Ordered spicy calamari for appetizer, it was definetly the highlight of the meal.  Our waitress was nice, but seemed to be in a rush and was very hard to understand.  We ordered cripsy orange beef, steamed halibut and kung pao chicken.  Here is where it got disappointing.  The halibut honestly tasted like dishwater.  No flavor at all, and kind of gummy.  The kung pao was not spicy, and the cripsy orange beef is so much better at PF Changs it is pathetic.  Because it was my friends birthday, they brought us ice cream with balls of kim-chee fruit.  We all tasted it and were laughing about the way it looked (BALLS) of kim-chee.  ( I am sure I am spelling that wrong) But the waitress thought we liked it, so she brought us 2 balls of that gross fruit in a martini glass, on ice.  I do not need to elaborate about the jokes that followed-seriously, one of the funniest things I have ever seen.  Long story-but basically, go to Changs, better, and cheaper.",

That few minutes turned into 15 minutes.  I had to complain to the host before the waiter arrived to take my Sea Bass and Green Bean order.    During 15 minutes wait, I noticed our waiter was selectively server all the \"elitist\" in our society.  If you don't get what I mean; IT'S THE FREAKING WHITE PEOPLE.  She ignored all the colored people in the room.  The Latino couple had to motion for her to server them several times before the waiter arrive.  My table didn't get the tea or the complementary won-ton wraps.  While I saw the white couple who came in 10 minutes after us got whatever they wanted.  Anyhow, we got cold after the food was order.  We drank ice water because our tea hasn't arrived.  Given it's already 15 minutes, the waiter must have ignored me.  So I motioned for the host to get me hot water because we were just cold.  She told me she will.  The host disappeared for 5 minutes and I don't see her.    So I stood up and asked for our waiter to give us some hot water/tea because we are cold.  I did not get the hot water/tea.   Instead I see the waiter got wine for the table next to me and continue to chat with her customers and ignored my table. She could have said\" water is coming\".  Instead she continued on her way to do other things.  I was too cold to hope that she may get me some hot water/tea.  I told my friend we are leaving and are going to somewhere else.  We went to 92nd Street and Cafe for food instead.  The waiter was not remotely being discrete about her racism.  For the past 20 minutes, I noticed that she ignored all the colored people in the room, but made sure that all the white people were being server.  She will only stop and \"respond\" if the colored person ask for things.  She will provide great service (check in, chat, etc) with the white people.  This waiter ignores anyone that is a darkie(Anyone that is not white.  I was highly disappointed that she validates all the poor service comments on Yelp.  There is no need to treat people this way.  Money is money.    I can't comment on the food/tea/wine/won-ton wraps because my friend and I were being ignored.  I can only comment on the water and it's just tap.      You will have a good time at Jade Palace if you are WHITE AND DRESSED AS IF YOU HAVE MONEY. For the rest of us that don't have the lighter skin pigment, stay away from this place. But if you have to go; stay away from this waiter.  I can't remember her name because she ignored my freaking table.  She is tall; slender, had a pony tail, and ASIAN and speaks perfect English.  We sat at the wing immediately to left of the building.    I'm planning tofile a BBB complaint against this place.  The owners will know who I am.  In this day and age, I refuse to accept racism as status quo.",

Well, I was so happy to find the Jade Palace, I used to go to the one on Hayden but it closed but was happy to find this location on Shea - the atmosphere here is so much nicer.  The food is unreal,  we had the New York eggrolls (of course) I was blown away and taken right back to Manhattan in an instant, generously filled and crispy as they should be unlike many AZ restaurants I've tried that try to pass of f a spring roll as an eggroll (what is up with that?) LOL anyway, VERY YUMMY!   Also had the chicken and brocooli, sweet and sour chicken as well as spicy chinese eggplant - everything my family ordered was great, so much food we all ended up sharing and having food to take home - I can't wait to go back to this place - it's worth the drive from Gilbert to go to for dinner - I have a feeling everything on that menu is great but no matter when I go I plan to order more NY eggrolls - thank you Jade Palace!",

We contacted the restaurant at 2:30 to place an order for pick-up at 5:30. We were told to call back 45 minutes before we wanted to pick it up. When we tried to call we got a consistent busy signal. Finally we sent my daughter in to order and discovered that they turned off their phones without even giving a message for customers to come in. She paid for the order and was told it would be ready in 1 1/2 hours and we would get a call. The restaurant never called and after 2 hours we went in and were told it would be another 45 minutes. Yes it was Christmas day but this experience was pathetic and judging by the other customers reactions we were not the only ones to have to deal with this. There are other excellent Chinese restaurants and they will now get our business.",

I didn't venture far from standard dishes,however, as I sampled egg rolls, crab puffs, egg drop soup and cashew chicken. All were above average. I ordered to go, but the dinning room looked nice.

This weekend I went to Jade and picked up a take out order. When I got home the order was wrong plus there was a small black bug in the lettuce wraps. Obviously the lettuce wasn't washed. This has never happened before and it was probably a fluke. But what bothered me was that when I returned with the wrong order and with the lettuce wrap the owner, Leon, could have told me that you are a great customer and come in often so let me make this up to you. He did promptly cancel the credit card charge but the point is that I was inconvenienced and had to drive back with the wrong order and then go to another restaurant to pick up food. I doubt that I will be going back. I pick up an order at least once a week and sometimes twice a week. I'm very disappointed.",

We tasted beef with broccoli, shrimp with lobster sauce, cashew chicken and Szechuan chicken - all were decent but not spectacular. The hot and sour soup gets a lot of play on Yelp, but it was a bowl of gelatin with some tofu and egg - pretty gross, but then again I'm not a big fan of hot and sour soup.

    "text": "Is it possible to give it a lower star?   My family decided to do Chinese take out on Christmas Day.  5 days prior I called to see what their process was for placing a take out order. I specifically asked if submitting my take out order would help with their holiday rush. They said it would definitely help and I proceeded to collect our family's order and call them back later that day with details.   Christmas Day had arrived and we had planned on picking the order up at 5:00. Grandma moo moo was very worried we might be late so we arrived at 4:40 just to be safe. We went inside the already VERY busy restaurant and gave them our name. They said it would be up in a few minutes and asked us to pay right away so we didn't have to worry about paying once we got our food.  The following is a breakdown of our full experience.   4:40pm: Pay and told it would only be a few minutes.  4:55pm: Overhear a woman beginning to raise her voice to the hostess only to find they told her a table would be ready in 10 minutes and she had been waiting for 65 already.  5:00pm: start seeing various take out orders appear from the kitchen. Grandma moo moo asks each time if they are for us.  Nope.  Overhear a man yelling about how it's crap he pays then is told nothing for another hour after his food was said to be up. Do not feel optimistic about the experience ahead.  5:15pm: Learn from a little girl who had been waiting 45 minutes for a reservation they had made for 4:30 that the fish in the fish tank is called a puffer fish.  Cool....now where the heck is the take out food. Moo moo is going to start worrying about Grandpa being at the house with guests showing off his toy trains for this long.  5:30pm: Man wearing bright patterned fleece PJ pants and fluffy slippers comes in for his 5:30 take out pick up.  He does not seem pleased when he is told it isn't ready.  5:45pm: Pretty funny to see a grown man in public sitting at the bar in fleece pj pants and fluffy slippers drinking a beer.   6:00pm: Realize the other people around us haven't gotten their food yet either and ask how early they ordered. 3 days was one reply and 2 days was the other.  6:10pm: Mr. 3 days early starts getting mad explaining he has 16 people at home waiting for food that was for pick up at 4:45. He demands a discount and they give him coupons for his next visit....sorry but based on his angry red face I don't think there will be a next time.  PJ pants and fluffy slippers is on his second beer.  6:15pm: Grandma moo moo and I text the family and ask them if a gas station chicken would be good. Drum up some support when we throw in we could also pick up slushies.  Proceed to ask if they could check on our order and see the gal walk away and avoid us as best she can when she returns. No answer received.  6:20pm: Mr. 3 days gets his food while apologizing to wife for 3rd time about delay, \"No honey, I didn't get lost they really were running this late!\"  Poor guy.  6:22pm: The food has arrived!!!  Pj pants and fluffy slippers is on beer number 4 I think.  6:23pm: Mr. 2 days asks if he can buy our take out for double the price since he's sick of being pestered by his super hungry family back at the house. Moo moo declines.  6:33pm: arrive back at Moo Moos where upon arrival my Grandfather welcomes her with big hugs and lots of concern as it's not often they are apart that long.  We can hear the toy trains are still going strong in the den where he had the rest of the family watching while they waited for food.  Family seems so pleased about the food they don't mention the exciting model train display. I trust it was awesome.  6:35pm: Realize we are missing one whole order of veggies and the extra rice we had requested. Oh well too hungry to care anymore.  Sucks for my vegetarian aunt though.   7:00pm: After woofing down food faster than I have in a long time, I proceed to finish it all off with my fortune cookie.  7:01pm: Cookie reads: \"Your honesty will take you far.\"  Ha....me maybe but I don't think it will be helping the Jade Palace much.   Next year - we are trying a different spot. What a mess.",

Szechuan Chicken was terrific with fresh vegetables and no onions with a snap of spice at the end. I'll order it more spicy next time.  Chicken fried rice had a great soft texture with a decent amount of chicken, but heavy-handed onions dominated the dish. The real disappointment was the scallops and beef dish. The quality of the beef was between low end and adequate ... A real negative experience. You could taste the excess oil in the dish ... Not good enough.  The restaurant can do better.

My main entree was Kung Pao chicken, which had tender white meat chicken but lacked spice and flavor and had an overabundance of water chestnuts and nothing much more than that other than the chicken. For the prices, that are somewhat higher than most sit down restaurants of this food type, I expect more to the main entree.  During my visit, a nearby table had guests whose conversations were loud with profanities and at times bliligerant towards each other as the lady was drunk and out of hand yet no one that worked at the restaurant did anything to address it.  I have to admit though, it was entertaining to me but in reality shouldn't have been allowed to continue as it did with the other customers trying to give the group hints to stop their poor behavior.  For the price, I will stick to my other restaurants for Kung Pao chicken.",

I do agree with other reviews that as time has gone on the quality of the food there has degraded. This used to be one of my favorites when it first opened, but now it's just not a bad place. Give it a try if you're curious.",

It is consistent, the service is good, the food is New York style so to be able to order great egg rolls and mouth watering spare ribs keeps me coming back again and again.    They offer a wide variety of entrees, some the traditional stir fry etc, but they offer a selection of things like sizzling sea bass, my husbands favorite, as well as crispy duck cut into pieces with the bone in that you can eat with your fingers.  When I don't order that one, I order either the spicy eggplant or the home style bean curd and thinking of all 3 has my mouth watering, especially with their fried rice dishes, darn!  Enjoy.......",

    "text": "It has been a year from the last review and I would like to add to my review.  We have been to the restaurant on Shea at least once a month over the last year.  We took our nephew their right before Christmas.  We ordered Ribs, Lettuce Wrap, Crab Puffs - we ate it all.  It was all fantastic, love their ribs.  We then had their soup, we order Won Ton and Egg Drop - it was delicious.  We were all very stuffed but then the meal came. Our favorites: House Lo Mein, Sweet and Pungent Shrimp and Orange Chicken.  They were all out of site.  The House Lo Mein was full of flavor and it went quickly.  I think that I consumed most of the shrimp which is so very good.  We took home some of the Orange Chicken and it made a great lunch. This is still our go to place for Chinese food and I work in Northern California and can't wait to get home and go to Jade Palace. Besides all of that the management and the staff are great.  We know them all and they have worked their for years. A great place, a fun place to go and have dinner.",

I like all the decor they had. We went without reservation thinking who would eat Chinese food on Christmas Eve? I was wrong. I was told to wait 20-30 mins.  Fortunately wait wasn't too long and we were seated at nice comfy booth.  Service was good. We waited for our food a bit longer than we are used to at any other Chinese restaurants but this place was busy.  Food was very good. Orange crispy chicken was spicy and good. Fried tofu with brown sauce became really good after I added some hot oil.  There are many more items on the menu I wanted to try, so I will be back soon. Next time I won't wait 10+ years.",

While the wait staff can be both inattentive and on top of you during the same visit. LOL But we keep coming back because it feels like home. It also reminds us of all those other great white table cloth Chinese restaurants we've eaten in over the years.   We arrived around 7 on a Friday night and Jade Palace was full swing, with a few tables just being bused. Lucky us! The wait was less than five minutes. We were able to be seated at a booth off to the side. It had both the advantages of being intimate, as well as tucked away and out of sight. We sat for long period before we were able to flag down the owners son. But we hardly noticed since we were having such a great conversation.   We were also fortunate on this visit to order off menu that delicious dish of Cold Noodles with Sesame Sauce.  It was a reasonable $9.95, and a old favorite of mine. Sadly I couldn't make the same deal to get some Sichuan Won-Tons. Oh well, the Fried Pot Stickers for $5.95 were very good substitute!  Our appetizers were complemented by some Plum wine and LI Ice Tea.  My friend Marvin loves this place and so do we. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/jade-palace-scottsdale-2?hrid=RRwVjbbyGOQSFkDY8VfAmA\">yelp.com/biz/jade-palace...</a>  For our entrees, we ordered the yummy General Tso's Chicken for $13.95 and the equally delicious Pork Lo Mein for $10.50. Both came with that individually prepared, layered taste that Jade is known for. We've eaten both here and the Jade up on Pinnacle Peak, but this is our favorite location.   Our bill came to just over $30 per person, including drinks and we left feeling well satisfied with this exquisite Chinese meal.   An energetic Four and half Stars, and yes we are most definitely Fans.   Enjoy!!",

The NY egg roll was absolutely awesome. They are large and filled with meat and cabbage/spices. The Moo goo gai pan was one of the best Chinese dishes I've ever had.

She was one happy camper.  Also of note: the hot and sour soup (steaming and peppery); the royal nest (shrimp, scallops, and veggies in a brown sweet garlic sauce); mu shu pork (the vegetables were fresh and crunchy, the plum sauce just sweet enough).   The atmosphere is pleasant on the eyes, and also if you're eating with a friend with disabilities, they have a nice, convenient ramp up to the higher seating level.   So why not five stars, you ask? I'm waiting to be seriously wooed by Chinese food. Otherwise, Jade Palace is a surefire good meal.",

So I ended up telling them to keep the white rice an I ordered a side of fried which was 7.95 a piece ... You would think they would compromise a little I spent over sixty bucks on take out !

Everything is a la carte, you do not get soup and an egg roll with your entrees.  The chicken chow mein is really good and the same way they make it back east.  The dinner portion is very very small and comes with a very small bowl of rice white or brown.  They will not substitute fried rice and they only bring out the chips when you order either a soup or a entree.  We had to asked the waiter who I think was the owner more than 5x for chips.  The wor won ton soup really does not have any flavor and is a bit salty.  Very expensive for the amount of food you get...plus it is very  very cold in the restaurant and they would not lower the a/c. I had to put a sweater on and wished I had gloves...if you want less expensive good Chinese food with large portions try Qwik Chinese Bistro on 92nd & Via Linda which is where we wanted to go but they are now closed on Monday.   The food is just ok, nothing to write home about and the portions are really small they will not fill you up.",

    "text": "Okay - so here's the skinny - the place looks questionable from the outside, but on the inside decor is tasteful enough to take someone out for a nice meal. While this is closer to the real asian dishes, it definitely still fell short of great chinese restaurants in SF. While the schezuan chicken lunch special seemed to be a popular choice for my compatriates, I thought it just passed mustard. Good, but not fabulous.  As for me, I've tried the Chilean Sea Bass and all I thought was it was just salty and the sauce was not appopriate for such a delicate fish. If you're ever in SF, swing by Osha Thai and try their Chilean Sea Bass - it's a great example how the fish should be served up.  However, comparably speaking, it's probably one of the better chinese restaurants in the area. Good luck with it.",

    "text": "Poor service is putting it too kindly. In fact in this day and age, I can rightly fully say it was downright racism. They weren't even subtle about it. We walked in on a Friday night and they were fairly busy but we were seated within 10 minutes. However, it quickly went downhill from there.  The server came by fairly quickly, but we still needed some time with the menu. But then, she decided not to come back.. even after we summoned her. And yet she had time to serve and make chit chat with the people at the tables around us. Then, after she *finally* came by and taking our orders, for another 15 minutes we never saw our drinks or anything else. So I asked her again for our drinks, after seeing her refill the glasses of several of our neighbors, she dismissed me with \"he will get it for you when he is free\" (pointing at the table busser). Now he clearly didn't get her message, as he was standing around looking for people to refill their water glasses. And so at that point, after more than three incidents of non-service, we just ditched the place.   So you're wondering where the racism was? Bad service was bad service right? Well, when the Asian server in a Chinese Restaurant is diligently serving everyone else (who were all white) and just paying my table (2 Chinese Americans) lip service, well that just smacks of dining in the segregated deep south in the 60s.  I hope one never has to experience that kind of treatment here or anywhere else. But you have to wonder... if they do this to someone, could they do this to you? Even if you've never gotten the same treatment, how would you feel about this establishment knowing that they discriminate?",

Conveniently located next to Sweet Republic, Jade Palace offers the perfect opportunity to suggest Chinese for dinner, knowing you'll end up with heaven for dessert.  Probably 3.5 stars, but feeling generous today.  I'm pretty sure this is why my husband suggested it.  But I had wanted to try it as well, and I'm glad we did.  Nicer inside than your average strip mall restaurant, I was surprised by the space.  Nothing too modern or contemporary here, but white tablecloths and candles on the table make for a nice atmosphere.  Our service was excellent as well.  We started with crab puffs and BBQ ribs.  The crab puffs were a pleasant surprise in that you could actually taste...get ready for this...crab.  In contrast to the typical cream cheese with flecks of pink you usually get, which I confess to love.  The BBQ ribs were way too fatty  with very little meat.    I always go with the safe dishes and ordered lemon chicken.  I was expecting the usual chopped up chicken, dredged in batter, and swimming in sauce.  What I got was the actual chicken breast, sliced, with a delicate lemon sauce spooned over the top.    My husband ordered the crispy roast duck, bone in.  I didn't try it, but I could see that it was, indeed, crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  He must have liked it because he ate no rice at all, and he loves rice, usually eats a pile of it.  I'll let some of our Yelper's with more sophisticated palates argue that Jade is Americanized Chinese food.  For me, I'm a fan and will return next time I need a Sweet Republic fix.",

It was nicer inside than I thought it would be...the restaurant felt intimate, and most diners kept pretty quiet, so it was a relaxing atmosphere.  The servers were very attentive, and more than once we had different servers coming up to ask us if we needed anything else.  The food was great- we shared spring rolls, veggie fried rice and veggie low mein and it was more than enough.  They also give you a generous portion of wonton chips with this amazing sweet orange sauce and a bowl of white rice.  Our total was around $23 for all of this, so prices are pretty reasonable.  There are more expensive dishes on the menu, but luckily for us, we don't eat meat.  If you do, you could end up paying anywhere from $12-20 for a meal.  I definitely recommend this place. It's in a strip-mall (what in AZ isn't?) and it's easy to see from Shea.  Oh and the portions were big enough that we even have leftovers for today! Woo hoo!",

My friend's grandmother wanted chocolate ice cream, which they did not have (only vanilla and pistachio that day), so we asked if they could put chocolate sauce on the vanilla.  So they brought out this huge plate with 3-4 scoops of ice cream topped with chocolate sauce, whipped cream, and maraschino cherries.  They really went all out!  Again, great service and not a bad place to go for lunch if you're in the mood for Chinese food.",

The interior is very nicely decorated and the waitstaff is usually very attentive. I recommend Jade Palace for lunch because you can get a pretty large amount of food for a pretty small amount of cash. $8-10 will get you soup (the hot and sour is quite good), entree, egg roll, crab puff, as well as crispy won-ton to dip in mustard/sweet n sour sauce. A great deal! I know the owner here and he has always been very friendly, courteous, and eager to satisfy!   There are several dishes that I would recommend, the first of which being the Sweet and Pungent Shrimp. This dish is cooked in an amazing sweet and spicy sauce, and the shrimp are lightly fried and crispy, served with broccoli, completely delicious! Another stand out is the Hot and Spicy Eggplant dish. If you like eggplant you will LOVE this dish! It is served in a spicy Szechuan sauce which is a perfect complement to the mild eggplant. Lastly I recommend the Szechuan Garlic Chicken. This is a dish that you can get at any chinese restaurant but Jade Palace makes it especially well. The Szechuan sauce is perfectly flavored and balanced. There are many other fine dishes here, but I would stay away from the General Tso's, it is the only dish I've had here that I didn't like (and I usually love this dish at other places). Enjoy!",

She thought the food was great -but it's my review and I would judge the food \"acceptable.\"  I say this with the full understanding that Chinese food appreciation varies wildly from one individual to another. That said, here goes dish by dish. The vegetarian fried rice was well prepared and delicious. BBQ ribs were tasty with a nice crust that may have been a bit burned. Let's call it well charred. The meat was dry even though the ribs were large and meaty. Mongolian beef was excellent. General Tso's chicken was meaty, nicely sauced and just minimally spicy. My favorite dish at almost any Chinese restaurant is Kung Pao chicken. I love the heat a good Kung Pao has. This was flavorful, but had no heat at all. It was, by far, the least of the dishes we had.   Would I go back?  Probably so. But, I would not order the ribs and I would specify a heat level for the Kung Pao.",

Bok Choy, dumplings, ribs, hot and sour soup, moo shu chicken, and mixed veggies! Everything was soooo good!  Ordinarily this is not my favorite cuisine, I am not a fan of the \"brown sauce\" that seems to be on everything.  However, the sauce that was on the mixed veggies was DELICIOUS!  A little savory w a hint of spice...so good!  And honestly, I could have taken a bath in the bok choy, I would go back just for that!  The dumplings weren't my fav, but they were good.  I'm just not personally a big fan of pork.  They give a ton of sauces for dipping, which I really liked, and the moo shu was soooo good!  I wish I had taken pics, but we were so hungry we just dove right in!  Highly recommend if you're in the mood for good Chinese food.  Also, service was really fast for takeout and stayed very fresh!  Yum!",

While the community is a lovely, pleasant enough city to live in, we've tried all the places the locals have recommended and have been severely disappointed.  Another local recommended that we leave FH and try Jade. We went to Jade last week for a late lunch at 4:00 PM and was surprised that the restaurant was empty.  We ordered pan fried dumplings, combination fried rice, combination kung pao chicken and Mongolian beef. Be warned my friends, this isn't your run of the mill hole in the wall Chinese restaurant, it tries to be white table so coming in dressed in work out clothes right after the gym and before their dinner rush probably wasn't such a good idea.  Back to the food...dishes at this place are not cheap. Don't think you're getting combination kung pao for $7.99 or even $9.99. Our chicken and seafood combo ended up being $20 plus dollars because of an up charge.  As far as tastiness and portions, it was nothing special, and not even enough to take home like most Chinese places, in fact the entire experience reminded me of Panda Express. So if you don't want to pay $40 or more for a Chinese dinner this isn't the place for you.",

    "text": "WHY are we forced to even give ONE star???    It's over for this place. They have been surviving by a thread connected to their longevity and some die hard old timers. But the reality of the situation is that the owners just don't seem to care anymore and that has definitely trickled down to the front of the house staff as well as the kitchen.  2 years ago ((yes, I've been procrastinating on writing a review for quite some time)) I would've said that the food was inconsistent, however, in the last 18 mos it's been consistently awful. No taste, off taste, not cooked well, tasting old, not seasoned well.  I'm talking take out, ordering in (delivery) or eating in. Just NUTS. They are overpricing themselves like crazy but the kicker is that the food quality has been compromised to an insulting degree. Almost $20.00 for 4 ribs, that are either burned to death or dry and not fresh ... like reheated. The servings on the take out/deliveries have been skimmed ridiculously. This past weekend (I know, right? Gluttons for punishment we are) the sizzling rice soup for two had the smallest shrimp available, one size above the mini cocktail size shrimp. NOT shrimp cocktail size, but teeny salad size. Two wontons, two shrimp. SERIOUSLY? And the taste -- which for years I'd crave their soup -- was flavorless. The chicken was mushy.   The service ... OMG the service. From downright rude, dismissive, & at least about 3 weeks ago ... the most moody, lazy, sadsack, pissed off hostess I have ever encountered. She huffed all the way to the table, and we watched her do that to every couple who came in for lunch. The wait staff forgets you, forgets part of the order, no eye contact while taking the orders ... I can't!!!! Anyway, I don't want to continue, I'm over it. If you've been giving this restaurant your money for years & years ... wake up and take note, are you REALLY getting everything you're worth? Is the value worth your hard earned money. Does the person you're tipping only smile, look you in the eye and actually speak friendly to you when presenting the check? If NOT --- Then YOU NEED TO MOVE ON. That's the only way they are either going to step up to the plate or get off the field and make room for a new restaurant. BTW ... we know the owner personally ... for many, many years ... and though we've mentioned here & there what seemed to be happening, assuming he would appreciate knowing, it's become abundantly and painfully clear he just no longer cares.  Not MY money ... no more!!",

We ordered the orange chicken and chow fun noodles with beef. Orange chicken was ok, the chow fun was incredibly salty and the beef lacked any flavor at all.

    "text": "We made our reservations and were seated within 5 minutes -- almost.  As always, we wanted a booth. This is how we like to enjoy our meal. Jade Palace seemed to have no qualms giving us a booth with the seat ripped and another section patched up with duct tape. This is not a diner --where such accommodations would still be unsatisfactory. The other side of the table had a regular chair, which didn't bother me but the sleazy cushion did. We refused this seating. The manager commented, \"So you want a full booth?\"  Would someone kindly explain to me what the heck is a \"full booth\"? As opposed to a half-booth? We've been frequenting Jade Palace for nearly 20 years. Never had an issue over a booth.  In a few minutes  we were given a full booth.  Thank you.  But let's move on.  Egg drop soup for two:  Wasn't the same.  Who added the sugar that was never noticed before?  The Schezuan shredded pork was anything but shredded. The portion consisted mostly of vegetables. Whereas the soup was too sweet, the pork lacked salt.  \"Very spicy\" was requested; something very far from spicy was delivered.  Most of the dish was left untouched -- not even worth taking home.   One of our go-to meals is the General Tso's Chicken. Most other places use too much breading.  Jade Palace makes this an excellent dish. Too bad I decided to try something new. Hey, if you got a good thing, stick to it. But I felt adventurous and if one dish is so good, why can't something else also be delicious, especially in Jade Palace?  Well, the Orange Beef was passable but not something I would order again. I ordered it because our waiter said the steak is done on the rare side.  Instead of being rare It was overcooked.  So, instead of an enjoyable meal and experience, we were let down. Perhaps Jade Palace feels that their reputation is enough to not treat every customer with the respect they are due.  Showing us to a dilapidated seat is an insult.  Serving food with improper preparation is a failure to make sure that the food will be on a par with the cost of the meal.  Just because we were given a booth in a higher priced Chinese restaurant is not the basis for taking advantage of customers and serving unacceptable food.  Jade Palace did nothing to try and neutralize a sweet-tasting egg drop soup. When it was brought to their attention, they agreed that the soup did have sugar.  They did not offer to change the sweet soup for another soup.  They also did not ameliorate  a pork dish that may have been acceptable in some  take-outs in the hood.  We expected more from this touted restaurant in Scottsdale which was our go to Chinese place.  Something different is happening in Jade Palace's  kitchen and it's not good.",

It was a very very very clean place which is unlike most Chinese restaurants. We got seated as soon as we got there because of the reservation and the wait staff was very nice and very formal. The only weird thing about the ambiance was that there was no dinner music just a lot of loud chatter from the other people dining in.  We tried the calamari for an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious. We each had our own saki and it our waitress came by with these champagne flutes and made sure our drinks were poured right.  The food was cooked to order and made fresh which is also unlike most Chinese restaurants.  This has been one of the few Chinese restaurants that I will recommend to people who live in Arizona and around the Phoenix area.  If you're craving good Chinese, this is the place to go to. Just make sure you make reservations or you'll be waiting.",

The food was very consistent with their other location. The crispy roast duck was cooked to perfection and came with very rich gravy sauce. This sauce was salty at their other location, but here it came out not salty but on the sweeter side. It was really good with the duck, but not by itself with rice. The portion was slightly smaller here as well.   The noodles and green beans were similar to the other location. Hot and sour soup was on the sweeter side. Overall, had a nice meal. I'd recommend.",

I mean is it that expensive to have decent menus printed out? Paper and ink, come on guys!  The food was mediocre and not like it used to be. I had the crab puffs as an appetizer and they were ok. A little undercooked and doughy texture. I don't want them super crispy either but it just didn't seem done right.   I had the Mongolian beef to keep it standard. And that's what it tasted like just standard. Nothing special. Nothing amazing. The lunch came with soup and got hot and sour. I enjoyed it.   I'm debating on coming back because the service is bland the food is ok and I just think the attention to details have gone to the way side which always makes me think if sanitary issues are ever an issue. If you can't get a clean menu down then what else is happening. Maybe another visit will change my mind.",

Both was served with delicious fried rice, spring roll, and crab puffs. While a little on the pricey side, the quality of the food can't be beat. The service is equally wonderful.",

The wraps and beef were great, but the kung pao shrimp was quite disappointing! It had absolutely no flavor and definitely no spice/heat at all. Very bland.  I emailed the restaurant afterward (filled out the form on their website), asking if something could be done to make up for this. It was constructive as we wanted to come back. Never got a response!   Thus, 1 star and we will not return.",

Spring rolls on the other hand were fresh and crisp, but inside was a bit bland and sauce a little sweet. We then had the special chow fun. Very nice dish with noodles, shrimp, chicken, pork, onion and scallions. Very nice.",

    "text": "I grew up in the Valley and as a teenager we'd visit Jade Palace on Shea at least every month or two.  Then I moved to another part of town and found a local Chinese restaurant near me that I came to enjoy on a regular basis.  Well, I was meeting a group of college friends for a late lunch on Xmas day, and Jade Palace was central for many of us so we gathered there.  Server was nice, but not amazing (when 20% tip is automatically added to the bill for a group of 12, I expect top-notch service).  Food was good too, with a decent portion size and flavor.  Nothing amazing, but it was good food in a nice place.  However, what really shocked me and my guests was... #1) the very limited menu (it was just 1 page, large type, with only 3-4 chicken dishes, 2 noodle dishes, a few beef and shrimp entrees and 2-3 soups/appetizers like egg rolls.)... and #2) the ridiculous prices!  Because of Xmas, they took away most of the menu options AND they jacked up the prices on EVERY item that they did offer.  These weren't special holiday recipes or entrees, just increased prices on their everyday items!  (Our server confirmed this, and tried to justify it as \"not many places are open today\").  I tried to order moo-shoo, but was told they wouldn't make it.  It was an assembly line process, with some of their more popular items premade in bulk, offered over-the-top prices.  If I want that type of food, I'd go to the fast food Chinese place (and save $$ too).  WOW!--  That's not what the holiday spirit is all about.  It's because you are one of only a handful of places open on Xmas that you do so well.  The wait was long, but I doubt anyone choosing to dine there anticipated the limited menu or raised prices. The owners are greedy, taking advantage of loyal regulars and new customers who decide to give them a try on this day.    It's sneaky, it's wrong and I vow to NEVER step foot in or oder from this place again.",

We went there on Sunday with a coupon ($10 off $45 bill) and ordered four dishes which easily totaled $45.  After we had finished the second course, we were told that they had run out of bok choy.  Consequently we were forced to cancel the fourth dish as we did not like the alternative of green beans.  When the bill came of $38 came we asked if they would honor the coupon because it was their fault we that we did not exceed the amount.  We were told no by the management.  Needless to say, we did not pay a tip.  Does this restaurant not understand the meaning of good customer service?  And how can a Chinese restaurant run out of bok choy!   As a result, they have lost a regular customer and I will let our friends know that Jade Palace don't care for their customers.",

Beautiful wallpaper, nice linen tables, plenty of tables and booths all with a casual atmosphere: 5 stars for atmosphere.   However, the food is just okay and the service is nothing great. I ordered the New York eggroll and General Tso's chicken--pretty standard fare. The eggroll was fine but the chicken tasted like boneless wings in a Tso's sauce. It tasted cheap.   The owner greeted us when we walked in and I commented how beautiful the place was, she asked me if it was our first time in and I said yes. You'd think this would mean they'd go out of their way to make sure our meal went well but nope, in fact I struggled to find reason to leave a standard tip (I did though, I always feel guilty if I don't).   I was there for about an hour an never got a refill on my soft drink. Our original server came by once to take our order and after that it was 3-4 different people topping off my boyfriend's iced tea or dropping off dishes. I was going to ask but the servers disappeared super fast.   The menu is general fare and I will probably go here again but won't get the General Tso's chicken. Certainly didn't live up to its Yelp! reputation. Maybe next time will be better.   I still prefer New China Gate in South Scottsdale but it's far drive form where I live now.",

This did seem somewhat of an unusual event however as even the restaurant staff seemed happy to see them go.  As for our meal, the flavor was perfect.  I thought that our two dishes had great taste and tender meats.  I also always do like enough sauce with our dishes so you can have some on your rice and its not dry and they did an excellent job.  However our food was basically room temperature.  After notifying the server who took it back to the kitchen to be reheated they brought it back and it was still tepid at best.  My other complaint would be that the portion size was smaller in my opinion, and the price was a little steep in comparison.",

    "text": "We just ordered take-out from the Jade Palace last night, so the experience is fresh in my mind. The overall rating from us is 3.5 stars, taking in to account the food and service.   Although we have dined in many times before, we decided to order a standard Chinese meal, sweet and sour chicken, with pork fried rice as a side---that was it. The chicken's breading tasted sort of stale to me although the meat itself was plentiful and tender. I thought the fried rice was so-so too, lacking in some seasoning and the onions were too crunchy for my liking, although it tends to be that way in fried rice. Overall, we give our food 3 stars.  The service, as always, is very good. The \"phone answerer\" when I called was polite and efficient. When I ran in to the pick up the food, the chatty and attentive hostess double-checked the order and price for me without me having to ask. The place was packed, and I am glad that we got take-out this time.  Just to share our experience with the food in recent past:  I thought the food quality was better for lunch rather than dinner. About a month ago, I had my usual lunch, the shrimp with vegetables that comes in a light and tasty garlic sauce with plump crab rangoon and my favorite, their hot and sour soup. I really like that soup; it's full of mushrooms and tofu and hits the spot as far as I am concerned. On this experience, I give their food normally 4 stars at lunch.  Overall, this is a solid spot for food and service, nothing great or particularly poor, thus the 3.5 rating.",

    "text": "Went to Jade Palace for the first time this past week.  I've got to explain the 3 stars because based on the food, it would probably be closer to 4, but our overall experience wasn't great - hence the 3.  A little background- the Hubs and I brought his Grandpa here for dinner.  His Gpa has Alzheimer's, so he needs help with the menu sometimes and definitely some patience.  Unfortunately, our waiter didn't offer either of these, which caused our dining experience to be a bit frustrating at the beginning.  Our waiter seemed abrasive and arrogant from the start, but it was only aggravated by the confusion during the ordering process.  For that reason alone, I take off some stars.  The food itself was served very fast and it was quite good.  The Hubs and I shared the mongolian beef and fried rice with bbq pork.  I loved the rice!  The beef was also good, but there really wasn't a good ratio of beef to onions... there were SOOOO... many onions and not nearly enough beef.  Grandpa had the shrimp chow mien, which he wasn't pleased with.  I think it mostly had to do with him ordering the wrong thing, but it really didn't look too appetizing (I didn't try it though).  So, I think the Hubs and I would go back despite this experience.  We don't have any other good Chinese places close by, so this would be a go-to spot for us.  The atmosphere is ok... we sat on the patio and there was live music next door for us to enjoy.  Inside is a bit out of date and stuffy, but the patio was nice.  Anyway, just my thoughts... I would certainly go back and recommend a friend to give it a try.",

The waiter dropped off the check and we got the payment ready. 10 minutes later he still had not come back and we had remembered someone paying up front and went oh we probably pay up there. As we were walking towards the front, he came back and went excuse me, you pay me. The food was mediocre at best. My mongolian beef was tough and fatty. My friend had the orange chicken and said it was also tough. Maybe their lunch menu is different than their dinner menu, but we won't be back to try. I have had much better at other places and will continue going there.",

Our party of four shared the Four Seasons, Mongolian Beef, lo mein with shrimp and Cashew Chicken.  The dishes came with a big bowl of white rice and another bowl of brown rice.  If these four dishes are representative of the rest of the menu then you should be happy with anything you order.  The service was very good and the prices were reasonable ($17/person).    The three major Asian restaurants in my part of the world are Jade Palace, Flo's and PF Changs.  I'd rate them exactly in that order.  Will we be back - Shi (that's yes in Chinese - I looked it up).",

    "text": "I was born and raised in the Phoenix area and I always laugh when people make comments about the \"quality of Chinese food\" here. Are you kidding? At this moment there are more people of Chinese descent in the San Francisco airport than in the entire State of Arizona. You aren't going to find the same food here as you will find in places like San Francisco and Vancouver. It's simply not going to happen.   But, if you've got a taste for Americanized Chinese food, this is a good choice.  I'm confused by the ageism demonstrated in some of these reviews.  I haven't noticed that a lot of old people eat here, probably because I don't care.  Heck, I'd rather be surrounded by people my parent's age than a restaurant full of young children with noodles hanging out of their mouth.  I've always had consistently good service and good food at this restaurant.  I'm certain you can find better Chinese food in San Francisco, but Jade Palace is much closer.",

Called on the way down to make sure they where open and got some strange answer about how they are open till 10:30 but close the doors at 10. Seemed strange but ok. Got there at 9:50 and the girl said they where done accepting customers for the night because it was 10. I said but it's not 10 and we just called 20 minutes earlier and was told come on down. She just stared and smiled. She would not budge. I could not believe it. Asked to speak to a manager and was met with the same creepy stare and smile. It's was odd. They just wanted to get out early.  I'm sure the owners would not be happy. Needless to say, they lost our business for good and also Avnet's (biggest company in Az) marketing departments monthly lunches where I manage. So upsetting.",

The slop they serve up as Asian at most chains is about as authentic as Sasha Grey's onscreen orgasms. (Unless we're talkin Slut Puppies 2, her crowning glory). Not Jade.  Jade serves up food that's on par (or at least close) with The Empress of China, one of my favorite San Francisco haunts. That's why Jade is on my bi-monthly rotation during season, switching to weekly when the snowbirds have gone back to where-the-fuck-ever.  Last night was yet another great experience. Fast friendly service, great tasting food, and well-prepared cocktails. We even got to visit with the owner, who was auspiciously holding court as he lit from table to table...his upbeat demeanor forcing smiles from even the most curmudgeonly of patrons.  My go-to dish is the House Special Egg Foo Yung which is served with a medium-sized ramekin of brown gravy. A must for any aspiring redneck / gravy aficionado. It's twelve bucks and worth every cent.  IMPORTANT WARNING: If you're Italian with a federal RICO warrant for your arrest, or, like to pay with counterfeit money, stay the hell away from here.  The owner explained how in his eighteen years in the business, he got his first fake twenties recently which means the FBI is probably now watching the place. Isn't that special.",

I've recently found a few options in Phoenix, but after a recent take-out experience with friends and last night's meal dining in at this JP location, I think I may become a regular!  We met my parents for dinner here, and everyone was pleased with the meal.  Service was spot-on, atmosphere was fine, drinks were cold and refilled often (the beers even came with chilled glasses), and most important, the food was fabulous!  I took charge of the food order for our party of four but allowed everyone to chime in of course.  Here's what we had:  Appetizers:  *1 large order New York Egg Rolls (2 total egg rolls but we had them cut in half so each of us had a half... delicious!) *1 large order BBQ Spare Ribs (8 per order)  Entrees: *Lo Mein Noodles with Shrimp and (extra) Broccoli *Dry Sauteed String Beans (1 small order) *House Specialty #9 (Kung Pao Three Delicacies) - Sea Scallops, Jumbo Prawns, and sliced Flank Steak in Kung Pao Sauce *Mu Shu Chicken   Of course, this was all served with plenty of white rice as well.  We ate almost everything, and the only negative I can say is that unfortunately, we didn't have leftovers to take home!    Another perk for this location? Sweet Republic is in the same shopping center, so if you save room, head over there for dessert!",

We have no previous experience of the delivery restaurants in Scottsdale. The hotel had a list of nearby restaurants. Jade Palace was on that list - however the hotel personnel did not have any experience by which to make a recommendation for Chinese Food delivery. We were on our own.  With a bit of time searching the internet we found Jade Palace's menu on line and found they had some of the best overall reviews of the local restaurants we found on line. At the time we placed our order the prices were slightly out of date on the online menu.  There are two Jade Palace locations - so make sure you use the one nearest to you. They quoted over an hour delivery - but the actual delivery time was only 40 minutes. The restaurant according to Google maps is about a 15 minute drive from our hotel. They charged $ 5 for delivery.  We really enjoyed the food that was delivered from Jade Palace.  What we ordered for two was:  - Pan Fried Dumplings - was Good - Sweet & Sour Chicken - was Good (a large size portion) - Grand Marnier shrimp - was Excellent - Baby Bok Choy w/Mushrooms - was Very Good - Moo Shu Chicken - was Excellent - Two of the dishes came with brown steamed rice - was a nice change from white steamed rice.  We are small to medium sized eaters and we have enough leftovers for a light dinner or lunch some other day.  Our hotel room had dinner ware and cutlery - however the Jade palace had offered delivery plates & utensils if we had needed it.",

    "text": "I've been here several times now and Jade Palace does not disappoint.  I love the egg drop soup and those crispy won ton chip things that they give you.  It is kind of pricey but it's not that bad and my boyfriend and I normally share soup and one entree anyway so it evens out.  For entrees, I recommend the #8 house special (filet mignon and prawns) because it's delicious and even though it doesn't seem like a lot of food when it comes out, it is filling.  We enjoy this place more than some hole in the wall Chinese restaurants we've been too and we typically love hole in the wall restaurants better so that says a lot about this place!",

We shared the duck, orange peel beef, crab puffs and teriyaki chicken. very delicious. I also had my first ever Cosmopolitan which the owner came over and asked how it was. I will tell you, it was great.   For dessert they brought him ice cream with hot fudge and candles, and sang to him in Chinese. so cute.   A little pricey, but a great meal.",

Delicious! And very filling.  (The sauce they offer is not gluten free and they do not have GF soy sauce, so bring your own) He has the lettuce wraps and sometimes the Pepper Steak which he says is absolutely fantastic! He also had the green beans and I tried 1... Wow! Delish! Nice restaurant for families or date night with great food!",

    "text": "I chose this restaurant mostly based on the location for ease of getting there from Fountain Hills for somebody who had not been to Arizona before and it's closeness to Sweet Republic.    To get the minor details out of the way.  I was reminded why I prefer tables to booths.  The seating was uncomfortable.  The only  other item was my chopsticks were so warped they were useless and I should have asked for another pair but instead gave up and used my fork.  We chose 3 entrees and all were good.  The serving size was appropriate for the target clientele.  If our group was 20 years younger we would have gone away hungry, as it was we ate about 90% of the food served.   Now what brings the 4th star is the service.  No heat orange chicken with red chile sauce on the side for me: no problem, Plum sauce on the side for the Mu Shu: no problem, Pictures of the group: no problem.  I have had this place bookmarked for some time and now I have been there it will remain on my list of places to go when I want a place to meet folks on the East side.",

    "text": "REAL NY STYLE CHINESE FOOD HERE IN ARIZONA!!!  FREE HOT TEA AND FRIED WON-TON SKINS LIKE BACK HOME! (BY REQUEST)  I am from New Jersey and so are the owners.  They opened up shop here 1 year after I moved here (1998) and I was delighted i could get a real NY egg-roll and spare ribs in Arizona.  Their best dish i feel is the Szechuan Garlic Chicken (or shrimp).  Try it once and you may never try anything else on the menu it's that good!!  Taste's the same as the best of NYC.  Their lunch specials are amazing.  Comes with soup, spring roll, crab puff, fried rice, hot tea (by request) all for a very low price.  Sunday is Dim Sum if you like dumplings.  This place NEVER disappoints and I bring work clients here from New York all the time.  They all agree, REAL NY CHINESE FOOD!!!!",

    "text": "A fine quality Chinese food in Scottsdale. My workplace caters from Jade Palace every month, so I had a chance to sample a wide variety from the menu. Their glazed salmon is great, perfectly cooked. Also try Shrimp Marnier (only if you like a little sweet taste in your entrees), it comes with candied walnuts which are a nice throw-off palate pleasers. Other fare such as dumplings, low mein, General Tso's Chicken etc. is good too. My Chinese colleagues tell me that, while their food may not be 100% authentic, they are happy to tweak it to make it more 'Chinese' if requested.   When me and my wife opt for a take-out from here, our \"The Usual\" includes chicken fried rice (done spicy) and spring rolls, all of which taste great. The level of spiciness is always spot on as per the request.   I am taking one star off because: (1) Their fried rice is usually verrry oily. The oil literally drips from the container, and we usually toss last few morsels from the bottom of the container due to excessive oil. (2) Their orange chicken is a little 'weird'. Chicken nuggets usually come out dry (too much time in frying pan??) , and the sauce recipe is probably different than usual. It doesn't taste like typical Orange Chicken you get from other places.   Overall: A good Chinese restaurant with great food and great ambience. Try their Lunch specials.   Cherry on top: Zero food safety violations, and hence an 'A' grade by health department. Try this one if you want to stay away from cheap take out places with questionable hygiene.  P.S. : Right next door to Jade Palace is \"Sweet Republic\" ice cream parlor, which was rated to be one of the Top 10 ice cream parlors in U.S. Some of their flavors are phenomenal.. but more on that in a different review.",

    "text": "Great place, five stars instead of four because of authenticity and lunch prices.  Food is pretty great, egg rolls are really delicious.  When I say authentic this isn't direct from the streets of China, let's be serious you're in Arizona. But, being in Arizona and actually having dim sum deserves some acknowledgment. Lunch specials are awesome. Their food is not overloaded with sodium.   It is a clean place that is fairly 'nice', enjoyable to go in and sit down for a meal.  I see a lot of comments about old people which is kind of stupid. Old people like nice, quaint places to eat and appreciate good value for their money so yeah, I'm sure they come here. You should probably follow them everywhere as they have good taste. Can't say I noticed the median age being any different than anywhere else, but then again I'm not an asshole. Anyway, check out Jade Palace and enjoy the tasty cuisine!",

It's so hard to choose a Chinese food restaurant when their reviews are all over the place. So anyways, I had a party of 5. Our waitress was super sweet and very attentive to us. My boyfriend ordered the szechawan chicken (he said that's how it's spelled but I'm sketch....) and he thought it was delicious. I ordered the orange chicken. The flavor was good but some of the pieces were too dry to even swallow. This may sound weird but their soy sauce had a \"tap water\" taste if that makes sense to anyone.. I ordered the chicken lo mein for my kids and they tore it up.. I tried it and it was a little too bland for me. Overall, the food was alright. I'm still in a desperate search for the perfect orange chicken.",
