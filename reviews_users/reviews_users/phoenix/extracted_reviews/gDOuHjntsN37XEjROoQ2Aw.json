The menu is not overwhelming, with enough options for anyone from any age. The salsa bar was fully stocked and very neat.... but here is what I did not like. There fish is chopped and battered, so its really hard to hold or to eat without looking a mess, especially if your like me and tries every sauce they offer lol. The fish was everywhere except the tortilla. After i managed to get past that, the flavors were actually ok, but thats about it. The fish was not crispy in any form, it felt like steamed bread stuffed with fish! The texture of the fish was nothing of what a real fish taco is. That was such a negative for me! All around not as cracked up to be, rubios is still better for a fast food fish taco and cheaper",

I met my boyfriend for lunch during his work break, and we will definitely be coming back here again and again!  I had a fish taco.  I love their salsa bar!  I think its great fun to dress your own taco : ). I topped mine with their sweet cabbage slaw, avocado sauce, cilantro dressing, onion salsa, pico de gayo, lime, and hot sauce.  I piled those salsas on and ate it with a fork like a salad... Too delicious!!   I am looking forward to sampling their other menu offerings, but am already craving again what I had today.  What an awesome deal for $2.99!  The interior is lovely and clean with a really nice feel.  The walls are blue with nice modern tiling and photographs on the wall, they have tv menu screens.  The people working their today (I think perhaps be owner was there as well) were very positive and attentive and the food was ready speedy fast.  This will definitely be replacing our trips to Rubio's as the food is much tastier and you get more for your money.  Can't wait for my next lunch there!",

There is also a very nice selection of sauces, salsas, slaw etc at the fixins bar.  This is a small, strip mall located , order at the counter, plastic utensils and plates type of setup.  Very clean inside.  It's only 11:05 a.m. and the place is already 2/3 full, so that should tell you something.  Can't say enough about the quality of the food.",

Don't be it is an amzing flavor and texture filling with in a simple corn tortilla.   Part of the fun here is the salsa/ slaw bar, Yes slaw 2 types sauces salsa and more to customize your taco as you want it. The sesame chili oil goes best of the fish machaca as anything heavier would mask the savory flavors.    The fried fish was done well too, not over cooked and crispy.  You are are not in to seafood your only option is a quesadilla, but I think this place may get you in to seafood.  My only grip is the price to amount of food. Tacos are $3 each and 2 of them make a small meal.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review on behalf of myself and Rob, my boyfriend, since I carry the Yelp torch in our relationship. We discovered Tortilla Fish during one of our late night trips to Walmart. We totally drooled over the idea of a little taco shop (Rob especially, as he loves tacos from San Felipe). We promised that we would go back during business hours.  Yesterday, we were in the area and decided to stop at Tortilla Fish. Not sure what to expect, we walked in to Tortilla Fish's TOTALLY ADORABLE little restaurant. The walls are blue with some fun subway tile, with lots of beautiful photos. Clean and cozy are two of the words that come to my mind. I got so excited when I later noticed the sea shells in the subway tile. So cute and original.  The employees were really friendly, especially when we told them it was our first time in. They gave us recommendations, told us about their best sellers, and even gave us some sauce combinations to try. Supremo customer service at this place.  I ordered two shrimp tacos and a cup of water. Rob got the full taco, a fish taco, and a soda. I think the total came to $15.22, which I thought was quite reasonable for two people. The tacos were $2.99-ish each, so I could easily see spending more than $15 if you came in HUNGRY.  Our order came up after only a few minutes, and OH BOY! The shrimp in my tacos were HUGE and there were plenty of them. Two thumbs up for emphasis on the SHRIMP in shrimp tacos. The fish in Rob's taco was stacked so high, he grabbed a fork (but didn't end up using it except to clean out the dish when we had finished).  I used the avocado and cilantro sauces on my tacos, with cabbage and onion and fresh cilantro, and all I can say is YUM YUM YUM. And the corn tortillas? Brilliant. Very soft and tasty-- though a word to the wise, if you plan to overload your taco with accessories, the tortilla may break (which, for most of us, is no problem. Give me a fork or I'll eat it with my fingers. Tastes good all the same). Lastly, I really appreciated that the contents of the salad bar are clearly fresh; they looked pretty and tasted great too.   Rob LOVED the full taco and the fish taco (to quote him, \"all that was missing was a beach with no surf\"). He used a combination of pico de gallo, cilantro sauce, and (I think) the extra spicy salsa. We were definitely a fan of this little place, so I think we will be returning soon.  Rob and I  say four out of five stars and would definitely recommend if you are in the mood for some clean, tasty tacos.  PS: Don't forget your phone in the car, because you get 15% off your order with your first Yelp check in. No worries, I will save it for our next visit!  -------------Update!--------------- After writing this review today, and then reading it over with Rob, we decided to go back to Tortilla Fish for lunch. That's right, less than 24 hours from our initial visit, we returned. And AGAIN, the food was delicious.  The employees remembered us, said \"Welcome back!\" and thanked us. A+ guys. Thank YOU!  I tried the fish taco today and WHOA. I think it is my new favorite. The fish was so moist and delicious it melted in my mouth. Topped with cilantro and avocado sauce and fresh cabbage, onion, and cilantro again, definitely a win.  Also...do yourself a favor and get the french fries. No, seriously. When one of the  employees said \"We have the best fries I have ever tasted\" I was skeptical, but I think he's onto something.  These fries were EASILY some of the best I've ever had, if not the best. They're a nice size and density, and are even a little flakey on the outside. Serious and overwhelming yum for these fries. Oh, and for a tasty treat, drip them in the chipotle sauce. Really flavorful and smokey. Thumbs up, all around.  Rob had two full tacos this time and was just as pleased today as he was yesterday. Bumping up to a 5 star from my original 4. Tortilla fish, we'll DEFINITELY be back.",

The fries aee as good as any and better than most the condiments are delicious.. the cilantro sauce pars well with the fish tacos and slaw stuff.   The tartar sauce reminds me of tzatziki.. it is way better than plain ol tartar..   Thus place is pretty tasty for a simple staple place.",

A Fish Taco shop is exactly what this area needed especially since the Baja Fresh down the street closed a couple of months ago.  The Fish Tacos are legit! They freshly fry them up when you order them so they are never cold. They have an extensive salsa/topping bar to make your fantasy fish taco just the way you want it. The place is always clean and the service is friendly. The menu is limited, (which I like) because to me that shows they take pride in they do. I highly recommend the standard Fish Taco for starters and the Full Taco which has  fish, shrimp and a cheese-filled yellow hot pepper  (but beware this one requires a fork once you pile on the toppings!). Enjoy!",

My coworker who was with me chickened out and went next door to the corporate Chinese place. I am glad I decided to come here. It was really good. The menu is pretty simple. Not that much on it and the prices are fairly reasonable. They have fish tacos, of course, and shrimp tacos. I decided to go with the Full Taco per the recommendation of the cashier. The Full Taco has fish and shrimp on a corn tortilla with a stuffed yellow pepper. The cheese in the pepper proceeds to melt all over the inside of the taco and makes it that much better. Before you take you food to go or sit down to eat make sure you hit up the toppings bar. With all kinds of salsa and other goodies to jazz up your taco a little. I also got fries and a drink. I did get two tacos which with the fries turned out to be more than enough. The total was $11 but with just one taco, fries and a drink I think it would be more in line with any other fast food place. The fries are really good. They fry them in the batter and wow. It makes them so much better than your regular fries. The restaurant is very clean and modern with TV screens of menu boards. The minor complaint is that the soda fountain is behind the counter. So they have to serve you your soda which slows things down just a little. But it is just a minor thing and not a big deal at all. Since this place is so close to work and so good I will definitely be back. Probably regularly.",

And it seems word of this has gotten out, I won't lie most of the time I go, I don't even check in because I wanted to keep this hidden gem to myself, but it doesn't matter anymore, somehow word got out!  The fish tacos are made to order, the fish is fresh and battered and fried, but you never have the greasy fried taste, it's always light and crispy. On Tuesdays, you can order 2 tacos and get the 3rd one free all for under 6 bucks.   I have tied other items but my goto is the fish tacos, just fish and the freshly made tortillas, they have a great salsa bar that you can add your slaw to your tacos, you can spice it up jalapenos, toss in some onions and cilantro and hit with some hot sauce! Hot damn this are some great tacos!  Like I said word has gotten out that this is a great taco shop and if your running short on time, hit up the Eat24 and place your order ahead of time, that's what I do.  Great food, great service and perfect for lunch or dinner!",

Only downside is no liquor license...those tacos would go down even better with a margarita or a Corona!  Awesome job with the place guys - wishing you much future success!",

I always get the fish and shrimp tacos, typically two will fill me up but if I'm super hungry I will get three. They also have a Campechano (mixed) taco that comes with both fish and shrimp and that is melt-in-you-mouth good too! The tacos are great size and they don't hold back on the filling!!! I love how they give you the tacos naked (with just the fish/shrimp) and you can add all of the salsa, and toppings you want! Don't let the shopping mall exterior scare you off, this is a diamond in the rough!",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Been here a few times and comparing it to all the fish tacos out there, can't give it a 4.  This is good, not great.  Not bad at all, just not phenomenal.    Major plus for having the creativity to carry a fish machaca taco.  A major negative from this last trip - got my throat stuck with a bone.  Some people would give 0-2 stars for this, this isn't that kind of place and I'm not that kind of reviewer.  But this pace can do better, and picking out all the bones should be a baseline for quality.  Also, with how wet it is and how much they give, it could use 2 tortillas.  It's not really Baja-style here.  Fried fish tacos in Baja were adapted from Japanese immigrants to the area using tempura-style batter.  Light, crispy.  The coating here is thin with some crispness but not the same as tempura-style.  Again, it's not bad, it's just not traditional Baja.  Also, it's more like a make-your-own taco here, with all the condiments on the side including the cabbage, onions, cremas, and salsas.  Great if you are picky about what goes into your taco, but I'd be interested to see what the kitchen would do if they composed the entire taco.  So not bad, not great.  Value is good for the volume, but compared to the best fish tacos I've had, gotta stick to 3 stars.",

Now tacos that is something I can get a hold of, so when Monica O said let's go get some tacos for Taco Tuesday it was on! Buy 2 tacos & get 1 free sounded good to me, and as an extra Yelp check in bonus a free large drink all for the bargain price of 6 dollars. Now that's a catch, no fish story here! I ordered the 2 fish tacos and 1 chicken taco, the batter was light, the flavor was right, and the portions were big. No tiny throw back tacos here! You can order whichever tacos you like, mix and match but the fish tacos are definitely the catch of Tuesday!  The topping tank has a full selection of sauces, from mild chipotle to the hotter hot sauce and it's definitely hot, and for an added mouthful, cabbage and slaw, jalapenos and limes for squeezing!  I've never been a big fan of fish, fishing yes but eating it has never been at the top of my favorite foods list. I've already been back for more, Tortilla Fish has got me totally hooked!",

If you ask me, that's a bit long for fried fish and shrimp on plain tortillas where you take them to the salad bar and build them yourself. The cilantro mayo is a winner though! Yummm  It would be handy if the tables were re-positioned, especially during lunch, where a lot of individuals are coming in to order. There was no seating available, so if you are one of the many waiting for your order, you will likely feel yourself in the way and awkwardly looming over the shoulders of those seated and eating.   The food is tasty, but the flow of things needs a little work. Overall, I would definitely go back. I'd say it is a good value for the price. The creative twist to the sauces, slaw and salsa really make the tacos unique. I would definitely go back again.",

    "text": "The name rings True. They serve fish in tortillas :) The menu is limited to mainly tacos and quesadillas and you can have your fish in various ways: fried, marinated, combined with shrimp, etc. For those that aren't in a seafood mood they do offer chicken and barbacoa. I had a fish machaca taco and a campechano taco. Both were around $3-4 each. I was initially confused because I associate the word machaca with shredded marinated beef. I then found out that machaca is also a type of Central American fish. Anyways, the machaca was flavorful with a citrus-y kick. The campechano taco had battered and fried shrimp and fish. The batter was light and tasted crisp against the tender texture of the fish. The shrimp were very slightly tough though. The name shouldn't be confused with campechana, a cold seafood dish in a tomato-based sauce (I did have some confusion there until I realized it was a different name. Basically there was a lot of word confusion going on in my head today : ) ).  The condiment/salsa bar has a myriad of options for your taco. Tartar sauce, shredded cabbage, various heat levels of salsa, and limes are just a few of the sides available. The very hot salsa is aptly named and definitely packs a punch!  The tacos have a soft corn tortilla shell, double layered and steamed. While they were decent as a vehicle to hold the meat inside, a little grilling would help add some texture and added flavor to the taco.  I came here around 12:30 and there were no seats left in the restaurant. I was originally intending to eat here but I decided to get my order to go since there was nowhere for me to actually sit and eat my tacos. They do have some limited seating outside, but it was a little too cold for me to feel comfortable eating outside for lunch.  Overall, it was an enjoyable meal. Maybe I'll stop by here again to dine in when it's not as busy.",

Which I've never had to do in my 33 years of eating quesadilas and it kinda defeats the purpose of it being a finger food. I live at McClintock & Southern and would not make the drive a second time.

The beef was very runny and couldn't be eaten like a taco. Wasn't much flavor. More like pot roast. Very disappointed. They didn't have chips. Wanted to give a new place a try. Won't go back. Original Burrito Company or Los Taquitos are both much better.",

I had the 3 for 2 Tuesday special. The shrimp taco was the best, followed by the fish machaca, then the Campechana. The menu is small, but that's because they focus on one area and do it very well.  Service was very friendly. The room is small without being cramped. The restaurant is clean and not heavily decorated.  I will be back, and I am telling my friends to check it out.",

This restaurant so-called goes down there with all of the Subways and Cici's and other restaurants where they are just downright lazy and don't want to offer good food. They make the basics, but you have to do all the work of making it taste better than something you could make at home. No thanks. I go to a restaurant to get food prepared and served by others, not to make it myself. My advice: stop enabling these lazy places by patronizing them and force them to figure out how to please the public. This place reminds me of a diner I stopped at in rural Wisconsin once. I asked for a steak sandwich, and they pan-fried a slab of tough, low-quality beef and slapped it on two dry slices of white bread. Well, I did ask for a steak sandwich...",

Everything is cooked to order so the fish comes out perfectly crispy and delicious.  All of the toppings are on the side, which was almost my favorite part.  The avocado sauce was my favorite.  The customer service was absolutely perfect.  This place definitely earned the title of best fish tacos in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "This is a pretty cool little Taco Shop that is tucked away in the plaza with the giant ghetto Walmart located in the northeast block off Priest & Elliot...  I am not a huge fan of fried food or fish in general, so I tried their Barbacoa Tacos, and they were pretty good after applying the fixings from their in house Salsa Bar.    I gave a solid 4 star rating because I have had better tasting Barbacoa Taco's, but for the very reasonable price point in comparison to the large portion size I really can't complain.  It's priced very fairly with respect to the quality/quantity of food you are getting.  I do wish they had more non-friend options for chicken and shrimp though for the healthy taco eaters like myself out there ... And I wish their Barbacoa was flavored/seasoned a bit better.  But, those are the only two things that can be reasonably criticized at this very well run establishment.  Taco Tuesday specials are awesome - buy 2 get 1 free!! You can't go wrong there if you are in the mood to celebrate Taco Tuesday!  Additionally, the staff was friendly, helpful and the facility is nicely decorate and clean.... So, I'm definitely a fan on Taco Tuesday (it is a 4 star Review when I get a free taco or two, but if it was an ordinary day I would give it a solid 3.5, and I may go elsewhere) Try them out for yourself and yelp about it! ;)",

Buy two get one free is their offer here on taco Tuesday but honestly, I'm willing to get them at full price.  The best part is that all their tacos are served up with a lot of fish, shrimp, or chicken based on what you order! My favorite is an order of fish tacos with tartar sauce & a few of the salsas from their self-serve salsa bar. When I go on Tuesday's I usually get the three tacos but it is really filling. If I'm going on another day, I just stick to two tacos.  They're usually busy but still fast at getting orders out. I've been here multiple times and will definitely be back!",

On this visit I ordered a fish and barbocoa taco and just like my first visit, I was disappointed. Maybe I'm just not a fan of fish tacos.  The staff at Tortilla Fish are always friendly and acomdating.  I enjoyed being able to watch my tacos being prepared. The fish taco was breaded, deep fried, and then placed onto a fresh warm tortilla, as was the barbocoa. Once my tacos were ready I headed over to the salad cart to add  ingredients of my choice. The salad cart offered lots of options, chopped avocado, tomato, cole slaw, cilantro, salsas, home made tartar sauce, everything and anything you would want on a taco.   All the ingredients on the salad cart  were fresh. I wish that the fish and barbocoa tacos had a better taste. The Fish and barbocoa were fresh, however,  both lacked seasoning and tasted very bland, the tacos had very little flavor. I didn't care for the tortillas. The tacos just weren't very good.",

    "text": "Okay fellow Yelpers, I'm not quite sure what went wrong but this is the first time you've steered me wrong.  We were craving fish tacos and were expecting a great meal but were sadly disappointed.  Maybe growing in SoCal ruined any chance of finding great fish tacos anywhere else...I don't know.  First of all, I'm really not a huge fan of these new \"do it yourself\" or \"have it your way\" type restaurants.  I feel like there is no creativity at all and I really want to be wowed when I go out to eat.  On that note, I get the concept and if I do end up at this type of place, I would expect that whatever I choose should blow me away because it's exactly how I chose to make it, right? Unfortunately, it seldom turns out that way and Tortilla Fish was no exception.  Absolutely ZERO flavor.  And this was with several different types of condiments. I would normally think that maybe my taste buds were off or something, but the husband and the daughter felt the same way.  We were all disappointed.  I suppose I should've known when they don't display the type of fish used on the menu that it was a mistake but I had hope.  I ordered both the fish taco and the fish machaca taco.  The fried fish was cooked well but as I said, no flavor.  And the fish machaca taco was mushy and just not good.  The hubby had two fish tacos and felt the same. The daughter had the shrimp quesadilla and that fell short for her as well.  The best part of our meal were the beer battered fries.  They were delicious and the reason for the two stars.  In addition to the poor food was relatively poor service and atmosphere.  The cashier did his job but the cooks behind him seemed grumpy and didn't even include our daughter's quesadilla with our order.  We had to ask for it so he quickly threw it together and recalled our number.  No apology or anything.  The restaurant is also very small and cramped, which would be fine except that it is also really unorganized with people standing everywhere and not really knowing where to form a line so they are basically standing over people as they eat.  Very awkward.  Overall, not a great experience and I definitely won't be returning.  Sorry!",

Once inside however, it's clear the owners really care about the store. Very clean, and the employees are very welcoming.  My girlfriend and I split an order of fish tacos and fries. I put their Tatar sauce, coleslaw, hot sauce, and chipotle sauce on mine. My god, the reviews can't do it justice. Let me say that I'm not normally a huge fan of fish, but the fish was so melt-in-your-mouth-delicious, you can't help but fall in love. The fries alone are worth a visit. Even splitting an order, I was full.",

We got the fried fish tacos which were actually really good. I was worried they would be super greasy but they were not. The fish was tender and flavorful. We grabbed a bunch of the sauces and salsas. My favorite tho was the grilled jalapenos marinated in soy sauce. I knowwww......sounds odd right but they were oh so delicious...like super delicious and the jalapenos were full of flavor!  I cut them up and put them in the fish.. Yummmmm. We also went with the bottled strawberry Fanta (from Mexico) that Fanta is always the best.   So all in all good food and a place we will definitely do a repeat of in the future.",

The battered fish tacos were nothing special...they were a bit over-fried and the oil tasted old. Using a combination of the different sauces from the salsa bar helped. Others got the seafood quesadillas and said they were bland; the only item with spiciness of its own was the \"machaca fish\" with veggies...a little soupy...would have made a better seafood stew.  The biggest disappointment was how limited the menu was. The \"aguas frescas\" they advertise....NOPE, only horchata. And that really quite excellent salsa bar....but they don't have any tortilla chips available! WTH??!! It was a deep disappointment not to be able to buy a basket of tortilla chips and try more of those salsas. Seems like they are missing a great profit opportunity...with wholesale bags of tortilla chips they could offer chips & salsa for sale, and even seafood nachos, and increase their profit margin. Not impressed. Will wait until we visit San Diego to eat seafood tacos and such.",

Everyone has good and bad days, but it's the consistently \"good\" businesses that receive my praise.  I was in the mood for some sea food, but couldn't decide how to satisfy the cravings. Suddenly it dawned on me - fish tacos! I remembered seeing a promotion from these guys (Tuesdays - buy any two items, get one free). Shortly after I think I blacked out for a bit :) because next thing I know I'm pulling away from the store with three tacos to go. :)  My advise, though, is to eat inside. If you have the time, their salsa bar is fantastic. The choices work well together and individually and the beauty of it all - you can customize it to your liking.  I definitely recommend this place and when you go, don't forget to check yelp for \"check-in\" promotions. I also got a free large drink because I used my app to check in.  Cheers.",

The prices are comparable, but the thing that stood out to me was the delicious selection of sauces they provide.  I personally like the Chipotle and avocado sauce. It's unlimited so make sure you don't overload on it :).  Will definitely become a regular at this place.",

The review that says the portions are small,  I don't know what they're referring to. The tortilla is a regular size corn tortilla,  and it is FILLED with delicious fried fish.   The restaurant is small and clean.  The owner I believe is very friendly and attentive.  Just the service alone makes you want to return again.",

I got a fish taco and a shrimp taco. I dressed it with nearly everything that was available and took it home to try. Boy were they bomb! I love that I can customize it with all of MY favorite toppings. Yummy!  The fish and shrimp were battered perfectly and fresh. They are not quite Tijuana tacos but they are pretty darn close! My only complaint was how easily the tortilla falls apart. I had to eat mine with a fork.   Tip: please utilize their happy hour. You get a fish taco half price from 3-6 everyday! :)",

They have a great salsa/fixing bar that you can load up on the tacos. The  only down side is that they only have fries, no chips? Which is why I took one star off. The guys who own it are great and will give you the 411 on what to try at the salsa bar. Cheap and and the tacos are big. I get two of them and am stuffed.",

    "text": "REALLY...EAT HERE AND EXPAND YOUR PALATTE. No texmex greasy steak fajitas here. Food inspured by fresh light flavors of Sonora. We were seduced by a flier for $5 off $20 or more purchase. This is highly creative chef owns his own place. We had the fish tacos, shrimp tacos, Fish Machaca, and the Gobernador Quesadillas. PRO TIP: These come as double tortillas loaded with meat only. You pile on your own fixens...and the cole slaw on fried fish tacos is divine! Loaded Fish and shrimp tacos were hand breaded and fried in house...NOT some crummy prebattered stuff. They are fresh and crunchy with deep mahogany batter, not crummy frozen panko. Three bucks a taco for fish, $3.50 for big shrimp. Huge..no way I am eating more than two. Machaca is like small succulent chunks of shrimp meat and veggies that had a unique flavor I could not put down. I ate the meat right out of the tortillia keaving the shell intact. It needed no salsa to fill your boca with sabor. Gobernador quesadillia is slightly sweet and creamy (not gooey) cheese with sweet gulf shrimp. It was my favorite and I put delicate tomatillo on it to enhance the sweet, delicate seafood flavor. We missed the Barbacoa...only so much made for the day...means we have to return tomorrow for lunch. Very yummy flavors. Best of show was roasted Jalepenos brined in soy sauce free on the salsa bar. My spouse ate 11 of them and I agreed that I had never had anything like that taste combination. This chef has a franchise explosion just waiting to make him a millionaire. Someone get this guy some angel investors so I can have his tacos at home in Chicago also! Suggestions? Get a be&sco mini press tortillia maker and make tortillias for us. Mmmm. Carve al pastor off a rotating spit for us. Wow...because you are a showman. Your creativity is infectious and I would love to see you turn the average American view of latino food upside down.",

Between my husband and myself we had the machaca fish, shrimp and battered fish tacos, and they were all really tasty. The corn tortilla had just enough elasticity to hold together without tearing, but was not chewy. The battered shrimp and fish had good flavor and did not taste like the fish sticks you get at the grocery store, like in some places. Two tacos was enough to fill me up, and they leave the topping choice up to you (there is a little fixings-type bar with slaw, salsas, etc). Worth the trip to check it out!",

Parking - got a spot right out front, probably easier in the evening than during the day (panda Express is right next door).  Plenty of choices from the menu, even have a kids menu, and a little glass-roofed food bar with cut up onions, salsas, etc that you can add to your dish or have them cook it in for you.  Pleasant guy at the counter.  My husband says this place is pricey for a taco shop. He goes to the taco shops all the time. He also said his food was mediocre. The rest of us thought our food tasted good.  Now to the only bad thing, which in this case is really, really bad and an easy fix (I am so grossed out, I knocked off 2 stars): As I sat there eating and watching the latecomers pouring in, I looked up for some reason. Above that little salsa bar on the ceiling is the return air vent. Extremely covered in a thick, thick chunk-layer of dust?? Or something...parts of it had chunked off and must have succumbed to gravity.  I shuddered and was glad I hadn't wanted any salsas or anything for my food.

We ordered carne asada, fish and shrimp tacos.  Everything was so good ~ nice portions, fresh and tasty. The condiment bar had great choices to load up on ~ cole slaw, cabbage, onions, jalapenos, lime, cucumbers, pick de gallo, and a variety of sauces. You order at the counter and pick up when your number is called. Employees were very friendly and service was fast. It hit the spot and was so good we went back again the next day for some more! Will definitely be back!",

The good: flour tortillas, salsa bar, friendly service, good location, the carne asada was delicious, clean bathrooms The not as good: chewy globs in the carne asada (I hate having to filter through my taco before I get to eat it) The bad: they make their beans with LARD and they do not have a black bean/no lard option so side selection is left to just rice.",

I stopped in after a doctor's appointment where I was just informed that I need to lower my A1C...meaning, cut the carbs.  My usual meal here is the fried fish and fries plate, which is not what I needed. I asked the staff for a healthier option, and they pointed me toward the Fish Machaca, which is seasoned steamed fish on a bed of greens.  I took their suggestion, and it was lackluster to say the least. First of all, it wasn't well seasoned, and there was so very little of the actual fish that I felt totally swindled.   I should have gone with my first thought and gotten the fried fish over a bed of greens, because that tablespoon of steamed fish tasted like nothing...I had to add a bunch of toppings from the salsa bar to get any real flavor.   You live and you learn, next time I'll stick to what I know and my review will probably be nicer, cuz normally the food here is yummy!",

Both were delicious, hot, and fresh. Many people's aces such as this can have dry meat as it sits after being cooked. Not here. Moist and tender in a way I have only had when the meat was just fresh off the grill. I might of got lucky but it made for terrific food. We will definitely be back.",

These tacos aren't the most inexpensive running around $3/ea depending on what you get so plan on spending around ten with a drink for a good lunch. But I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "This is my new favorite place for fish tacos. The boyfriend and I went here for lunch and each ordered one fish and one shrimp taco. When you get them, they are plain - just the fish or shrimp. But then you head over to the salsa bar and add the topping that you want.   I added the slaw to both and got a few sauces to try on the side - avocado, chipotle and cilantro. They also have different salsas, ranch, tartar sauce hot sauce, limes, and more so you can really customize your tacos.  The slaw was fresh and crispy. All the sauces I tried were good but my favorite sauce was the cilantro. It was creamy and not overpowering.  The tacos are pretty big, bigger than street tacos. Two were enough for me, boyfriend did go back for a third.  Both the shrimp and the fish were really good and I love that you can add the toppings that you want. I will definitely be back!",

I will definitely be getting the shrimp again and again. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The corn tortillas had a mild flavor and held up well to sauces.   The hot salsa wasn't joking, go easy on it the first time even if you are a spice lover like me.  There were plenty of condiment choices, from the traditional pico de gallo to  worcheschire and tarter sauce. Something for everyone.  This place looks modern and clean.  It has really comfortable chairs, believe it or not. Plus, the staff is really nice. I recommend going on Tuesday for their 3 for 2 taco special. I'm full and my wallet thanked me.",

But good quality, friendly service, and quick turnaround.  Nice salsa bar which has different topping for your tacos,  that includes a coleslaw like topping, a few different types of salsa, jalapenos and a chipotle mayo and avocado topping,  plus a few other ones.  Had one taco that had shredded steamed fish that was much better than I expected (not fishy, and the perfect amount of spices,  and another one that had fried fish, fried shrimp and and fried pepper stuffed with cheese.  Ingredients of good quality and freshness that I really enjoyed.  Sometimes I don't feel well after eating fried foods, but this one wasn't too greasy,  and felt just fine afterwords.     I did try the fried fish and french fries,  which was too doughy and not enough fish, just the smaller pieces that you'd get in the tacos.   That I would not recommend.  Dining area and restrooms were very neat, and clean, and people there are also super friendly.  Good value..",

The staff seem to work at both locations and they are very pleasant and helpful.   I have never had a bad lunch here.

This place wows and is definitely a good local find. I went with the fried fish taco ($2.99), the mixed fish and shrimp taco ($3.50) and a shrimp quesadilla. The fish was SUPER fresh and light. They serve the tacos bare, and have all the fixins you could want to pimp out your taco. They had 4 different salsas ranging from mild to super duper hot, quite a few sauces like chipotle, avocado and cilantro, plus onions, cilantro, lime and just about anything you want.

We got 2 full fish tacos which was both fish and shrimp. They bread and fry the seafood which is just the way I like it. They give you tacos plain (just tortilla, pepper, cheese and fish-they don't skimp) but their salsa bar is where it's at. Here you customize your taco. They have an array of salsas, sauces, veggies, and even coleslaw to top your tacos with. I LOVE THIS!  The coleslaw was crisp and fresh, pico was on point, no mushy over processed salsas here!  They also had squeeze bottles of mayo, chipotle dressing, cilantro dressing, ranch and of course hot sauces. All were awesome.  I almost got full off 1 taco! Now their fries, you don't expect much but these were some of the crispiest fries I've ever had! The tacos were very reminiscent of some we've had in Baja Mexico and I'm so glad we found some here.   Service was on point. Ruben the co owner was very friendly and while we ate our tacos he was very attentive to other patrons and even took the time to explain the salsa bar to a gentlemen. They seem very into making their customers happy and comfortable.   He let us know that Tuesday they offer a buy 2 get 1 free taco special and that if you like their Facebook they offer additional deals.   We will definitely be returning!",

The fish they serve isn't heavily battered where you can taste the cod and moistness of the fish-great! Decent price, where they offer all you can eat fish tacos from 3-6 pm each day.

Super fresh shrimp and fish tacos made to order, an amazing assortment of daily-made sauces and salsas, incredibly engaging owners and employees, and a nice clean dining experience. Seemed odd to me that they'd offer French fries instead of tortilla chips but I certainly can't complain-- the fries were outstanding, gold and crispy on the outside and downy soft on the inside. Try them with the house made ranch dressing! My husband is a salsa hound so he fell in love with the extensive salsa bar. He eats habanero peppers raw, too, so when he told me that the extra hot salsa was HOT, I believed him.  Thanks, Yelp, for letting me know about this place.

I also love that the condiment bar has a variety of sauces and accoutrements to dress up tacos to suit each customer's varied tastes.

We were in town a little past dinner time and wanted something simple couple of tacos nothing big, and we saw this place on the web and we searched our way to it. For the first time finder it could be considered a little around the corner and back hidden, but I'll bet if I knew this layout I'd have found a lot faster. I don't hold that against anybody that's my needing to know more about the area, even when I don't live there. Anyway back to the tacos, and the taco bar, and the friendly guy who cooks it up and cashes you out. Everything was very nice. I love a good salsa bar was good salsa fresca, green salsa, radishes, and several other goodies for me to munch on and enjoy with my chips. I like that. Next to Tacos came out and I had three little tacos and she had three little tacos and we just enjoyed those little tacos a whole lot. I think if I was nearby this would be one of my regular lunch stops over and over again. I do love these little taco shops",

People, this place has the best tortillas ever.  Better than homemade ones I've had recently, and even better than - dare I say - Carolina's.  I just ordered an ordinary burro, but with the first bite I was immediately taken back to my childhood and that freshly made tortilla rolled up with a paper towel, butter running down my forearm.    Really sorry I can't tell you more about the other food, the service or even the ambiance.  The tortilla obliterated all else.  Santa Madre is in a strip center on the North side of the road in the WalMart parking lot, just directly South of the WalMart.  You're welcome :)",

This is one of those places that I wish had more locations, just so all the goodness could be shared amongst everyone   Fish Tacos are amazing, like finger-lickin' good. Their Tatar sauce is delicious, along with their ranch and homemade salsa. You cannot go wrong at this place. I will say that the carne asada is delicious too, but I'd pass on the chicken tacos. Everything is made-to-order, so if you are in a hurry- call ahead.   Have never had an issue with service, but the place is small and the parking is crap (sits in the same plaza as Walmart, never to a drive-thru for Panda Express).

I thought this place had to be amazing since it has such great reviews but I was definitely underwhelmed. The fish definitely seems fresh and is made to order so I'll give them that but the service was slow. We were getting our order to go with a baby past his bed time and our food took FOREVER!!! My husband and I each ordered two fish tacos with fries and that's it. I think we must have waited at least 15-20 minutes for our simple order. The fish was soft but I prefer my battered fish tacos to be a little crisp on the outside and I'd say these were almost soggy. Also, you're literally getting fish pieces in a tortilla and that's all. No white sauce, no cabbage, nothing. There's a small salsa bar to add to it but it's not the greatest. Overall, the fish tacos were nothing special and the wait and cost was definitely not worth it.

Someone brought in a meal from this place and I took a little piece of fish from his plate and it piqued my curiosity.   Later that week I came through to try it out. The first thing I noticed was the clean and tranquil lobby. They like to jam Buena Vista Social Club and Juanes, which isn't too overbearing and plays on the atmosphere well.  I ordered the full taco meal, which include two tacos filled with shrimp, fish, and peppers. I watched them batter the shrimp and fish and was already stoked to inhale my meal. Additionally, they have a salsa bar and there are more than a number of combinations.   Long story short, the tacos were tight and the fries were addicting (add lime!). I will definitely be back and I hope they continue to keep serving their meals at the bar they have set for themselves.",

    "text": "YUM! So glad I made the decision to give this place a try.  Tasty, satisfying, fresh, reasonably priced, and a couple of really great guys behind the counter.  Theses two are providing guidance and info about the food, directing to the best place for menu viewing, taking the orders, and cooking it up to order. Did I say FRESH?  The fish was fresh and tasty and the light batter was very complimentary, not a lot of fluffy filler.   The salsa/condiment bar was far from what you might typically see (Baja Fresh, America's Taco Shop, etc.).  Not to say anything bad about any of those but this one is just different.  Loved the cilantro sauce and the hot habanero salsa.  You can choose between chopped cabbage or a (dry) slaw as one of your toppings too.  But really, what's a fish taco without cabbage?   And let me tell you, their version of tartar sauce is not what you might expect either -creamy, light, refreshing compliment to the fish.  Wish I could just order the first alone just so I could enjoy some of their tartar sauce with.  They also have a hot oil.   Interesting.   I went with the Full and and one other.  Forgot to get pics cuz i was hungry and anxious to try these.  My son had the Gobernador and Campechana.  I tasted his quesadilla and give it two thumbs up.  We were very satisfied with our choices and glad we decided on this place for lunch. We will be back.",

Long line & noticed on their menu-no nachos?! As we made our way to the counter I inquired and was disappointed they don't offer them. However, I got chips and a side of beans. The cashier recommended that their salsa bars has additional topping; so I went with that! My daughter got the three Carne Asada tacos and a drink.   Pretty pricey for about $19! They use a system which doesn't provide a receipt offers gratuity rates which I tipped on, but I never received a copy or an email for my purchase.?!   Salsa bar has many bottled salsa, fresh salsas, coleslaw ( very bland) jalapeno, cucumbers, lime wedges and a guacamole sauce (very bland).   Chips are made in house-fried corn tortillas. They were good. Beans bland, but hot temperature wise. Saw some burritos coming out that looked HUGE! I'm not a fan of rice/ beans in burritos but they seemed impressive. My daughters tacos were ok. Small street size tacos and carne meat was moist. The unfortunate part of this experience was the bland taste of the meals for this being a Mexican food joint. Average menu & average experience.",

The salsa and sauce bar: FRESH AND DELICIOUS.  I got the Carne Asada fries and they were very good. The fries were crispy with a seasoned coating, and the meat was tender and plentiful. Loaded up with toppings at the salsa and sauce bar, and I was ready to devour.   My coworkers got an assortment of burritos and tacos to get a good sample of the menu. The burritos were easily 1/2 to 3/4 pound each and they will mix in any of the salsa sauces you want if you bring them back to the kitchen. A nice unique treat for sure.   The tacos were all very good, but the clear standout were the Campechana tacos which were an amazing combo of fried fish and shrimp. The team couldn't get enough of these and pretty much made a unanimous decision that next time that would be the single taco of choice!",

    "text": "Yelp really let us down with this one. I love small taco shops but our visit was definitely not great. Upon entering, every single table was visibly dirty, but I get sometimes things get busy so we went ahead and ordered anyways. They also have pictures of tacos in frames that are too large for the photos.. leaving awkward gaps in the frame. I'd honestly probably just pin the photos to the wall instead of this but... why am I focusing on the decor? Time for tacos.   You order at the counter and receive your tacos. They are served street taco style, there is a salsa bar with some additional sauces and slaw.   My girlfriend got the 3 carne asada taco combo which came with a side and drink. I went with one barbacoa taco, one chicken taco and one surf and turf (shrimp and carne asada). The guy who rang us up was nice but when he grabbed the cup for our drink, he put it down in front of us top down.. so the rim of the cup was on the counter. My girlfriend usually tries to avoid using straws (#savetheplanet) and we just thought it was kind of weird and unsanitary. Never had that done before.   Once our tacos were ready I headed to the salsa bar and added my desired toppings. My girlfriend just stuck with cheese on her tacos. Unfortunately, there was a hair embedded into my chicken taco. It was under toppings and some meat and way too short to be mine or hers. Didn't want to cause a fuss but we asked them to replace it. They did and apologized but it took almost double the time that it took us to get our initial order. But I appreciated they at least replaced it. Towards the end of our meal my girlfriend found another hair in her third taco. We really hope it was hers lol...  As far as the food itself:  Barbacoa pork taco: bland... watery... not good. I usually judge a taco place on their pork and this was the worst thing I had. I couldn't even finish it which is a rarity for me.   Carne asada taco: mediocre. Not terrible but not particularly seasoned. Not a ton of flavor.   Side of Beans: pretty terrible. Totally bland. Only made it through a bite or two.   Chicken taco: not bad. It's more breaded but it made it have a fish taco vibe so I added some slaw and Baja sauce and thought it was decent.   Surf and turf taco: this was pretty good. The only taco I ordered that I would actually eat again. I added some toppings to it which helped but I felt even standing alone with the meat this was a solid taco.   Side of rice: really amazing rice. Sad that this was the highlight but they are doing this right!!  Chips: they must fry these up made to order or regularly, they were hot crisp and pretty good. Another meal highlight.   Overall, I just wasn't impressed. With so many similar taco shops, the dirty interior, hair situation and lackluster flavor just doesn't cut it. Especially for the price point. There are worse places though..",

I was not impressed with taste of the barbacoa it was kinda bland and lacking in taste the strongest flavor was the bay leaves.   Being that this is a taco place I decided to give it another try. I tried the carne asada tacos.   Tacos meat is tasty but it's the salsa bar that really makes these tacos stand out. They have everything from cabbage, cilantro and onions, green salsa, red salsa pico de gallo and guacamole they also have fresh cucumber slices among other delicious options.   At my most recent visit, I was greatly disappointed to see that the portions of the tacos have decreased considerably and prices have gone up. No longer a good value for you money.",

My favorite are the breaded fish tacos. They are big in size and only takes 2-3 to fill you up. The salsa bar is what makes these tacos so delicious. The chipotle sauce and the cilantro lime salsa are the best for the fish tacos. The carne asada fries are really good too, they have more of a homemade taste to them but don't count on a big portion size.",

Let me first say the reviews for this place was dead-on.  We ordered the carne asada burrito, the fish tacos and the street tacos. They were all satisfying and filling. Especially the carne asada burrito. The salsa choices varied from mild to very spicy and when I say very spicy I mean VERY SPICY. My only drawback was I wish the fish tacos were more crunchy than they were. Overall whenever we are in the Tempe area this will be our Mexican food go to location.",

I love the salsa and condiment bar.  If I have one suggestion it would be to move it to the middle of the room so both sides could be accessed.

There's a garnish bar to load your tacos w/ cabbage, slaw, Pico de Gallo, etc & various degrees of sauces. The green cilantro sauce was my fave. My S/O got the steamed fish burrito, zen meets gargantuan.  he liked it. I liked mine better.    Appreciate the super cleanliness of this place & the fresh food but my reason for the 4 star is the plastic utensils & paper plates, not very sustainable in my opinion.

First - I hate onions and don't like deep fried food, especially fish. They have literally nothing that's served without onions unless you get it deep fried. They have shrimp and other not fried fish but it's in a funky looking congealed mix that included onions.   Honestly, if I wasn't really hungry and in a hurry I would've left. Instead I ordered a quesadilla with fried shrimp. Not the healthy meal I was hoping for but...it is what it is. It was okay. Nothing rave worthy.   The girl taking orders was sick and cranky. Rather wish they had sent her home. I don't like sick people so close to my food. There was a younger guy that was refilling the salsa bar. He was very friendly and the other reason for the star uptick.   I won't be back but others love this place so I'm sure they'll be in business for a long time.",

I was excited to try TF per the Yelp reviews and my expectations were surpassed.    The menu is small (shrimp, fish, chicken and barbacoa) but you are ultimately responsible for how you enhance the flavor of your fresh meal with the unbelievably tasty salsa bar options  That salsa bar is unlike any other offering I've experienced.  The house ranch is an addictive drug that enhances the taste of the already crispy fries.  The salsas, especially the extreme ones, are fantastic.  Add cabbage and chopped onions to finish things off and you'll maybe make it a week before returning for more fish taco heaven.  I'm very happy Tempe has an unrivaled fish taco shop that I can take guests to from out of town.  TF will make a mark in every visitors' taste buds.  *Tip 1* Tempe residents should check their mail for TF coupons from time to time  **Tip 2** If you return to TF, check to see if the owner remembers you.  I bet he will!!  ***Tip 3*** Half price tacos from 3-6 PM and buy 2 get 1 free on Tuesdays.  Work off the gluttony by playing some video games at Gamestop next door.  ****Tip 4**** Try to eat at the restaurant for your first visit.  The salsa bar should be experienced in house!!!!",

One is that everything seems so fresh, and the other is that despite my initial impression that the tacos are small, I always leave here full and satisfied. Honestly, the thing I cannot get over is the condiment bar. It is kept chilled and offers all manner of extra taco fillings... fresh salsas, chopped cabbage, limes, peppers, and the squeeze bottles of creamy sauces. I cannot discern what makes the Ranch Dressing here taste a hundredfold better than any other. Is it real buttermilk? Is it whipped up fresh every day? Do they add extra garlic or spices? I can't place it but it is phenomenal.  The other striking thing about Tortilla Fish is that I can no longer eat fish tacos without french fries. Their fries are absolute heaven when you pair them with my own concoction of fry sauce: It's half ketchup and half creamy chipotle dressing. Like their Ranch, the Creamy Chipotle is second-to-none. And the fish taco options keep growing every time I visit. On my most recent pilgrimage, I tried the \"full taco\" (fish, shrimp, and a cheese-filled yellow hot pepper) and the \"fish machaca taco\" (steamed and shredded seasoned fish). Both were excellent.  I'll admit it. I'm addicted to these fish tacos and fries. And there is no rehab for me, simply more repeat trips to my favorite fish-taco craving destination.",

    "text": "Great Mexican seafood at a reasonable price. The menu is limited. My wife and daughter shared a Campechano platter (two combination fish/shrimp tacos, plus french fries). I had the Gobernador shrimp quesadilla. They feature a full salsa bar, with cabbage and coleslaw, a mild green sauce, and a spicy and really hot red sauce. They also have a  tartar sauce. All of the sauces are made in the restaurant. The food was very good and -- at this price, combined with the superb service, rates 5 stars. They also serve horchata and jacaima as well as yanqui beverages. The tacos were good; the fish breaded and fried. The shrimp quesadilla was terrific. The fries are fried very crispy (some sort of batter?) but are left for you to season.",

We met a gentleman who seemed like the owner or at least a key employee there. He helped us pick our order (I love when folks do that) and also recommended what salsas, toppings and sauce to try for what we ordered. I had the fish taco and the machacha fish taco - both were very yummy! The machacha is steamed fish with plenty of yummy seasoning (ask for a sample if you're curious) and the fish taco is delicious battered fish. The fish tasted fresh and the batter was amazing!! My husband tried the full taco (which he said was really good) and the governer's quesadilla which he wasn't a huge fan of as he felt the shrimp was a bit over-cooked. I would stick to the tacos here. Will definitely be going back as it definitely fulfilled my fish taco craving! YUM!!  ps - beware that they close early at 8pm. :)",

One great feature of this restaurant is that you can put what you want on the tacos at the condiment bar. If you love lots of cabbage and onions (which I do), you can load up your tacos till your heart's content. The horchata was okay, I would have preferred less sugar and more cinnamon and nutmeg. They have coke made in Mexico (they still use real sugar there) which is the best! The menu is somewhat limited, but worth a visit.  BTW - the 3 for 2 Taco Tuesday is a GREAT bargain!!!",

By far the best, and I mean the BEST, fish and shrimp tacos I've ever had! An I should know, I'm a beaner! It's in our blood! We invented tacos! The fact that you can do fish alone or shrimp alone is reason enough to try this place, BUUUT... throw in the fact that you can have both in one taco with a cheese filled chile!? Oooooh child errybody  got time fo dat! This place has been my vice ever since I've found this place. I'm always having people go there to try their wholesome goodness. These aren't the skimpy small tacos you'd expect at a taqueria, no sir, these are the real deal tortilla, not no carb friendly serving chingadera. Bask in the glory of a full taco, which subsequently is one of the taco's name on the menu. Although I have stopped going in to order food myself, I always send my lowly sevants, or lot attendants as they are called, to pick me up some deliciousness on taco tuesday. Why? Because it's buy 2 get 1 free! That's 3 tacos! Plaster on some slaw, some cilantro sauce, avacado sauce, a and the piece de resistance: Chipotle sauce... you've got yourself a masterpiece of a taco. 5 stars for this heavenly eatery spot!",

Taco Tuesday is great if you can eat a lot, as it's buy 2 get one free. And they're not the small street taco size either. It's the full on regular tortilla. Fish is battered and fried, no other choice. But it's crispy, fresh and plenty. Also had the fried shrimp here and it's firm, fresh and crispy too. The salsa and condiment bar is really vast in getting your meal just the way you want it. Could use some work on the drink area. But, refills are free. The only other local choice for dependable fish tacos was Rubios. Pretty good, but, not the taste and value that T.F. is.

My favorite is the full taco with fish, shrimp,  and a cheese filled yellow pepper.  I usually break it down to two tacos with the 2 tortillas they provide so I can fit my mouth around it. The music they play in the background is perfect for the food and atmosphere too!",

My favorite is their standard fish taco - always fresh, light and palatable with just about any fixing you like!   I normally go to the Phoenix location, which is my favorite!  But either is good. The owner of these stores is really down to earth, passionate about good authentic food and truly cares about your experience every time you come in. Love that! So hard to find.

    "text": "I Love Eating at this Place, especially on Taco Tuesday's. Been going here since they were called Tortilla Fish PLEASE TAKE CAUTION!!! If you order two tacos you get the third one free, BUT if you make an order let's say 2 fish and 2 shrimp you should get 1 fish and 1 shrimp free... if you look at your bill they don't bill you that way. They will charge you for the most expensive of the two and give you 2 free of the least expensive of the two. I did ask the lady working the register about it and her response was there's nothing I can do, that just how my register rings it up. So I'm like, I'm actually paying more bc I ordered shrimp and you're charging me for 3 shrimp when Your sign CLEARLY states  buy 2 and get the third taco free. She brushed me off when I told her that the sign is misleading. Anyhow, I've just learned that if I order more than 3 tacos on Tuesday, I need to make 2 different transactions so I don't get charged more on my third taco  Just FYI! Other than that, their Tacos are extremely delicious",

I made the mistake of ordering these to go and the crispyness of the fish steamed away a bit but the flavors were still there.   The salsa bar was a wonderland of flavors and colors. Try the green sauce in the bottles. You will not be disappointed. My only real issue was the cabbage is chopped up fine instead of shredded which is a staple of traditional fish tacos. That being said the fish makes up for it. Staff was super helpful and service was really quick. Get in there for some tasty tacos!",

You order at the counter and are given a number while they prepare it.  The menu is basic featuring fish tacos, quesadillas and fries. Everything is made to order. Tortillas made fresh daily!

So, I throw it in the trash and write it off as a bad decision. Well.... an hour later, it's a mad dash for the restroom and I had it coming out of both ends. And being a man with a great sense of humor, my colleague was teasing me about the incident. Well, 3 hours later, boom hits him and he got it also. He had fish tacos and I had steak.

The food and salsa bar is awesome. The portions are very large and the prices very inexpensive. We questioned how good could it be because of the low prices. That was shot out of the water when I opened up my fish tacos! The fish is fresh an I love their tortillas. The tarter sauce is very different but everyone liked it. I got my mom a fish dinner and she really enjoyed and the hot fries. We could definitely just share on dinner and be full. Instead we had lunch for the next day! I guess they have everything I was looking for . Fresh too!! Yumm",

Got lunch here today and ordered the combo #2, which consisted of a small drink, one fish taco and shrimp salad that was a lot bigger than what I was expecting.  I was thinking it was side salad sized, not entree sized.  (I also thought all of the lunch combos came with 2 tacos, not just one.  *sigh*)  As far as the food goes, the fish taco was great, but the shrimp on the salad tasted *suspicious* so I tossed the whole salad out after a couple of bites rather than risk it.  I may still regret those bites that I took.  That remains to be seen...  The whole meal set me back over $9 and really all I got to eat was one fish taco and small lemonade.  Not so much with the value, eh?",

They have a salad and salsa bar that you can freely top your taco with chipotle sauce and avocado sauce, peppers, and salsa. The fries were also delicious. At first sight the tacos looks small but with the seasoned fries and the extra toppings from the salad bar we left stuffed and happy! If your really felling adventurous try watermelon tea with sprite while your at it my personal fave",

Make no mistake, it's a fast food restaurant in a strip mall, opposite WalMart. But remember the old sage, you can't judge a book by its cover. Same goes here! The place is clean and uncluttered, and the staff is ALWAYS very friendly and helpful.  But the food! Always fresh, made to order, and very tasty! I always order two tacos (and get one free on Tuesdays ) -- naked style, which means no tortilla. Then customize to my liking at the excellent salsa bar. Amazing flavor combinations are possible! Be sure to try the chipotle and the cilantro sauces.  Check out my photos for many examples of what can be created. Today I decided to avoid the fried choices, and went with two Fish Machaca tacos - naked style, of course!",

The menu is extremely shrimp heavy, which isn't great since I'm allergic. I did learn that they COMPLETELY separately cook the shrimp from the fish (including labels on everything - so I knew they weren't just saying that and it probably would be safe for me to eat).  I wasn't too hungry though, so I just got the simple cheese quesadilla for $2.99.  It's pretty paltry to look at, but once you add your choice of toppings from the condiment bar, it's worth more than that, for sure.    The had an onion mix, cole slaw, fresh cabbage, pico, several salsas, several sauces, and a great selection of hot sauces to choose from.  Drinks include free refills (but drink station is in the kitchen so it's not self serve--not my favorite).  I hope this place succeeds. It's in a strip mall by Walmart (gag), and next to Subway and Panda Express (gag).",

Cabbage both green and red, limes, pico de gallo, and onions tasted fresh.  I paid $7 for both and I thought it was a nice treat.  Better than Rubios, I think.

If I lived in Phoenix, I would try other stuff on the menu.  It was also inexpensive which is nice. Definitely will go there next time I'm in Phoenix and in that area.",

I had checked in online to receive a free large drink.  I ordered two tacos and he informed me that it was taco Tuesday so I could either pick a free taco or use my free drink.  I thought it was weird I had to choose between the two.  I ordered a fish taco and the full taco.  I think it lacked flavor and it was soft and mushy, not crispy.  The salsa bar was just ok...lacked a lot of flavor as well.  The tarter sauce was pretty good, but that was all.  Like I said, it might have just been an off day, so I might try again in the future....based on the fact it seems like everyone loves it here.",

They were still installing the security system so they're still figuring things out, based on their website, this is their 1st and only location thus far.  The measures of good corn tortillas for me are: are they fresh and do they fall apart - and these are really good.  The fish and shrimp were fresh and tasty and the cheesy pepper was a nice touch.  The salsa bar is nicely stocked with different salsas / condiments similar to what you'd find in Mexico.  The menu is simple and reasonable - definitely worth checking out if you're in the neighborhood!",

They have a great selection of house made salsas, sauces, and other toppings for whatever taco you choose. Currently only offering corn tortillas but I have been told flour tortillas are coming soon. Staff is friendly and helpful. They do a buy 2 get 1 free deal on Tuesdays and the place is small so you may not find a table at lunchtime on Tuesdays! I rarely give out 5 stars but this is one of my favorite places for lunch so it's worth it...and worth you giving Tortilla Fish a try as well!",

The shrimp tacos were the best and the little station filled with fresh toppings was great. It was a bummer that my machaca tacos had a lot of little bones in it, and the horchata drink tasted powdery and sour. I also came at a time when the restaurant wasn't busy, but the floor and some tables were dirty. The smell of fried food also lingered in my hair and clothes when I left lol! Again, the experience wasn't bad, but I don't think I will visit again...I still prefer Americas Taco Shop.",
