I'm the kind of person who will happily eat the worst pizza out there, but this deserves special mention for tasting worse, having a worse texture and makeup than the cheapest grocery store freezer aisle pizza you could find. I don't get how they make pizza this bad. I could throw tomato sauce and cheese onto a goddamn tortilla and nuke it in the microwave for 15 seconds and have something better.  That being said, their calzones and strombolis are somewhat acceptable just because they actually have to FILL the product with some ingredients (or they will give you sauce containers to dip their anhydrous product into), rather than leaving a dry, sauceless cheese on top of some stale dough like they do with their pizza. Their alfredo pasta is probably the best thing on the menu, and even then it's just because alfredo pasta is impossible to botch.  This place is good for two things: 24 hour delivery, and beer delivery. If you actually order food from them because you think it tastes good you are a nut. That being said, it fills an important niche role with those two things, and for that this horrendous establishment has a warm spot in my heart. Also, their delivery guys are always pretty friendly even at 4 AM which is pretty much the only time I ever see them.",

Not only was she rude...she rushed me off the phone when she said my card declined (which by the way Zio's took with no issue, so I know that she input it incorrectly).  I work front desk at a hotel right next to ASU and I see your guys deliver here all the time and a lot that comes from the staff at our hotel telling guest about your restaurant.  But no worries I will tell everyone to send the business to Zio's because I would not want our guests to be subjected to her nasty attitude, at least there they are friendly.  Cheers!",

This is the worst customer service I have experienced in a long time. Would give zero stars if possible.",

    "text": "Living in new York City for several years eating pizza I gotta say that the pizza at Gus's is definitely NEW YORK PIZZA!  Today we ordered the 32inch pizza the pie was the size of our entire table! The pizza slices was crazy long that you need to use 2 plates for one slice of pizza. I was very happy that the workers worked quickly to cook our pie. They had it ready within 10 minutes. I noticed During the winter months like today the restaurant gets a bit cold inside it would be nice if ghey turn on the heat to stay warm. So thats why I rated them 4 stars not 5. Was gonna drop it to 3 stars but since they had tv's showing the football game it made up for that extra star lol.... the restaurant is fairly  clean and nice.",

We tried to order the Greek fries and the lady said they didn't have lemon juice and couldn't make them and before I could ask for them without it she snapped just fries. A little rude but it's all good. I just wanted food. So I ordered two cheese slices and my friend got pepperoni and sausage.    It came out hot and fresh but also the crust was a little dark.  I folded my slice and prepared to consume some great pizza. But as I took a bite from that slice it literally broke on half and the cheese slid off. Not very good. Me and my friend both agreed we could barely taste the sauce cause it was very bland. The pizza had no taste and was too greasy. I love a little grease like the next guy but this was dripping down my hand into the plate when i was eating it. I ordered two slices but only ate them because I didn't eat dinner.  My friend didn't even finish his slices.  Skip this place. While the place looked nice and was cool the food was not. Try Venezia's instead on mill. Such better pizza and service. They should lose the NY in there name cause that was not NY pizza.",

The guy making my pizza looked like he really knows what he is doing because the crust was perfect, the sauce ratio to the cheese and toppings was perfect, and the cheese was lightly burnt in spots on top as it should be.

Final straw? $10 delivery fee ($4.95 standard delivery charge and $5 out of area fee)!! Are you kidding me?! I used to be in the pizza business and never did I have to charge anyone $10 to deliver within a 5 mile radius. Standard delivery fees are normally $2-3.

Stay away...I like supporting small businesses but having no customer service by being rude and obnoxious and having a ridiculous delivery fee made me want to go and give my business to someone else. Honestly if their customer service was on point I would have been happy to go and pick up the pizza instead of having it delivered. Too bad...I really wanted to try this place but it's their loss not mine. Luckily I didn't order! Based on how many negative reviews on here and absolutely zero response from management or the owner they just don't care about customers. I hope they fire the staff and change management to better serve the community.",

    "text": "Been coming to/ordering from Gus' since 2008 and those extra large pizzas keep me coming back for more every time. There are two super-addicting toppings I always order: buffalo chicken and meatballs. They deliver 24/7 which is also a big plus. My fav size is the 24\" but have also ordered their largest (32\"). Be sure to bring a party of hungry people if you order that one lol, you'll still have leftovers. Since they moved to their new spot there's a lot more room for diners to eat-in and they have plenty of large TVs for watching the live game.  My only gripe is that the quality of the pizza does differ from order to order. Sometimes the crust is so on point and other times it's a bit dry or burnt on the bottom. It's not a big enough deal for me to stop from ordering, but would make the experience that much better if they could find a way to make things more consistent.",

They redeemed themselves by gifting us a pizza on them with us only paying the delivery fee. They quoted us an hour as usual, but we received our pizza within 30 minutes, and it was fantastic. Exactly how you would expect your pizza to be. These guys will never disappoint, and IF they do (by chance) they make sure to correct their mistake. Thanks guys!",

    "text": "Gus's redeeming factor is that the pizza is available 24/7, and they do have a gigantic 32 inch pie you can dine in or take out (The boxes on the 32 inchers are incredible!).   We walked in and were greeted by one of the staff, which I appreciated. Everyone else working there though, seemed genuinely unhappy and stressed about working here. Going up to the counter to place our order, we asked if we could get half of a pizza one type, and half the other on a single pie. Denied. So, we ordered 2 smaller sized (14 inch) pizzas and some garlic knots as an appetizer. Note that they will charge you an extra $.50 if you use your credit card.  The garlic knots came out first, piping hot. They were decent, and served with ice cold marinara sauce which also was just OK. Out of the two pizzas (Bronx bomber and Margherita), I preferred the Bronx bomber better in terms of flavor and toppings. The Margherita had some anemic looking, sparse tomatoes on it, with a fine dusting of dried basil. I couldn't taste much garlic on it either. The Bronx bomber was more robust with the meaty toppings, red sauce, and cheese. The garlic they used on it was a heaping amount, the kind of garlic you scoop out from a jar that's already pre-diced.  Overall I wasn't really wowed by the pizza nor the service here. But, if I'm in the area and it's late at night, I might come here.",

The main issue I had with the 4 topping pizza I bought was the placement of the toppings. It's my biggest pizza related pet peeve when you spend over $20 on a pizza with 4 toppings and half the slice is just cheese. And I don't mean that the ingredients took up half of the space on the slice overall. No, I mean that if you cut the slice in half at the middle, the bottom half of the slice had some toppings and the top half was just cheese. Some of the slices had more of one ingredient than the other, or barely any of one of the ingredients at all. There's just no excuse for that. All toppings should be spread evenly throughout the entire pizza. And the sausage seemed like the pre-cooked, frozen crap you would find on a Dominoe's pizza.",

Than of course good old Gussy poo would be the greatest thing delivered to cure anyone's late night munchies when they are open 24/7.    I originally ordered for delivery but called 20 minutes later and actually went to go pick up my order because of a few not so good experiencs with pizza deliveries in in the past.  Knowing that at least they can fix it right away in person!  At least so I thought.....  I opened up the box and discovered wow!!!  This was as close to an awful piping hot mess with the smeared lipstick and bad breath!   We're talking cheese that had strong not so mozzarella cheese odor that was perhaps spoiled and toppings that weren't evenly distributed!  1/4 of the pie I ordered barely had much pepperoni.  The crust was a bit undercooked in the middle. This appeared to be slapped together by someone who had just overslept and realized they were late for their nap!    You would think by being there in person to address fixing it would've been no big deal but sadly they were so swamped with orders.  I let it slide and just decided to cut my losses.  In hindsight I should've just asked for a refund.  3 slices were somewhat edible.  The rest went into the dumpster fire.  Based on the inconsistencies of the pizza I ordered at this location. This is indeed the russian roulette of pizza!  Eat at your own risk with a potential sleepless night!",

That leads me to the next thing, grab a ruler! The 14\" pizza is at most 12\" (which means you're missing over 25% of your pizza).",

    "text": "PERFECT place to grab a bite to eat and beer before the ASU football game! I came here with about four other friends, grabbed a table, beers and ordered a 14 and 18\" pizza. Plenty of TV's to watch sports and a nice outdoor patio.   The pizza is awesome, I can't say much for the pasta and other food they have but I'd recommend the pizza for sure. Thin crust and crispy! The service could be better and it wouldn't hurt if the employees would smile or at least pretend to care that there's guests in their restaurant. I'll be back for game day, but other than that I'll look elsewhere.",

I don't think the pizza is very good at Gus's, so if you need middle-of-the-night chow, Geno's Cheesesteaks will deliver a freshly-made burger, chili fries, or a satisfactory pizza until 4am (Silver Mine Subs is cheaper and have a few decent sandwiches and deliver late too, but their cheesesteak is nowhere near as good as Geno's).  I see I've turned my review into the late night delivery wars-----it was inevitable, I guess.  Gus's will deliver beer to your door:  a 6-pack of PBR for $6.99 or Sierra Nevada for $9.99....",

I usually stick to minimal toppings, but getting a supreme pizza here was just that - great mix of veggies and lots of meat on every slice and best of all, not too greasy. Definitely will come back for more, and their hours make that super easy.",

I don't know what has changed in the last year, but even the customer service has gotten 100x better at this location. I still have my random mishaps but really its in college town so its bound to happen! The female manager is amazing ( Sorry forgot her name ) but she is definitely going above and beyond from what you expect from them!

    "text": "Beware. Overpriced and underwhelming. We ordered three slices. One Margarita and two Hawaiian. The Margarita was considered a specialty item...ok, sure.  Anyway, the total was $16.95 which could be ok if it was delicious NYC style pizza but this is NOT. They essentially took three pre-made cheese slices and added a sprinkle of the 'specialty' toppings. The pizza slices came to our table cold and the toppings slightly colder.  Go to DP Dough right next door for a made to order calzone. This place sucks if you're looking to order slices, especially anything other than cheese.",

However, lately as work has brought me over to Arizona far more frequently this year; the hours have been longer and the meals faster and later. With that being said. I've tried a few other locations of Gus's Pizza, and they were less than satisfactory and left much to be desired. Though their competition isn't very steep as most other pizza places are not 24 hour and are all chains like Dominos, Pizza Hut, and Papa Johns.  With all that being said, this location and its production is tops in Arizona. ESPECIALLY WHEN JESSIE working the oven and making the pizzas. Hands down a night and day difference in quality when he is at the helm. I recommend anyone go there, from NY or otherwise while in town if he is working. Just call ahead and ask, and if he is order immediately. The only draw back I find is that the pizzas are a little on the expensive side. I think some small five dollar coupons or point system for a free small or something would go a long way for business and tips.",

    "text": "what an awful excuse for a NY pizza. being from the east coast myself, this pizza isn't worth the outrageous prices u pay for it. i've been here a few times, yet i went in tonight with a coupon for a large pizza for $6.99. it was 430 am (gus's is 24 hours) n when i called for a pick up order, i drove all the way there just for them to tell me that my \"coupon wasn't valid since it only works thru certain hours\" and the worker told me it was 12pm-12am. ridiculous. my coupon doesn't say anywhere that there were specific times it'd work lol. next, the worker continued to explain to me why it didn't work and that WITH the coupon, they were gonna give us a 12 inch pizza instead of the reg large 18 inch bc the \"large size changes when u have a coupon\". so WITH the coupon, i'd be expecting a large pizza but i'd only be receiving a 12 inch.  we also paid extra for extra sauce on our wings, yet they came up dry as fuck and a 2 liter of SIERRA MIST (not sprite) was $4.05. this place is OUTRAGEOUS. who in the fuck knew that a large size pizza magically changes size once u have a coupon. WHO KNEW. never have i ever gotten pizza from a place that changes their sizes prices. we called for a large n came w a coupon but didn't get the use out of the coupon sooooo... fuck this place, don't waste ur money on mediocre pizza. never coming back here again. they thrive off ripping people off.",

NO EXCESS OIL on the pizza, which indicates a higher quality cheese. Firm, slightly crispy crust that folds easily and doesn't flop downwards when you're eating it. And quality toppings. I also ordered the fried pickles and fried mushrooms, both very good. I'm not ashamed to admit I ordered here a second time within a 1 week period, it's just that good.

Ordered a supreme with no pepperoni, picked up and got home (without checking before I left) to find there was no sausage either just vegetables. Called to explain what happened and the lady argued with me that this is what I ordered, a supreme with no meat. Not only did she argue with me she then started calling me a liar stating she asked multiple times that I wanted a supreme with no meat. I never said no meat, if that was the case I would have ordered a veggie pizza. All I wanted was to get a new pizza with what I ordered and I would have driven back to take the other pizza back however she said there was nothing that she could do for me because that is what I ordered. I asked to speak to a manager, she said she was. I have messaged the business and also called now and I'm just getting the run around. I have eaten there so many times and ordered the same thing in which I told her to look at my past orders and she refused to do that as well. I refuse to ever eat there again and will ensure that I tell everyone about this experience. Seems by reading the reviews on social media I'm not the only one that thinks their customer service is terrible and there is no resolution to their mistakes in ordering.",

The men behind the counter are rude, unprofessional, and gossip about customers that leave the restaurant. I always order one slice of cheese pizza and one slice of pepperoni pizza, and both of the times I visited, they were a greasy mess. I paid good money for that? Combining all of this with the expensiveness of two slices of pizza, it leaves me hoping that one day Gus's will be replaced by a better New York style pizza place.",

The pizza is good, the wings have an original recipe and the beer prices aren't bad.  They did however, offer a free slice of pizza for anyone who gave them a good review. Ethically, this is flawed, but since I enjoy the place I didn't mind.  Since then, they have been nothing but trash. I received a $20 gift card from them for showing up on opening day for their new location. The card did not work, and Gus' refused to do anything about it; jerked around with handling the situation.  Then the last straw was Super Bowl Sunday. Gus' refused to take a coupon because, \"technically SB Sunday is a holiday.\"  Reason enough to take my business elsewhere.",

Negative is that, when I called to place the order I asked if they could use white alfredo sauce versus the marinara.  The employee who answered the phone and was taking the order, had no idea what I was talking about and told me he would put me on hold.  That was fine.  When he picked up he said he could only do a ranch sauce, I then said they had a \"white pizza\" and chicken alfredo on the menu, so why couldn't I create my own white pizza?    Then he proceeded to say that is was not possible, I said it was fine that I DID NOT want ranch and to use marinara.  When the pizza got here, it was ranch....  The guy who delivered was actually really nice and the greek fries were good as well, thats why I am giving stars.",

    "text": "Alright, so the pizza is a 6/10 as far as delivery places go (not exceptional, but it's recognizably pizza). My beef is with my delivery order.  Ordering online forces you to give roughly an hour grace period. For example, I placed my order at 6:00 and could only request it as early as 7:00. My pizza arrived at 7:30, even after the hour long grace period the establishment had to have my order ready to be delivered on time. Also, it's worth noting that this was a Thursday night.  My delivery driver hands me my pizza and takes off. I come to find it wasn't the pizza I ordered, so I call the store to let them know about the wait and wrong pizza. I am told the delivery driver will turn around with the right one.  Admittedly, I had started eating the other pizza for two reasons. First, I had been waiting a while and was starving. Second, I didn't expect they would actually want the pizza back to then go deliver it to someone else, as there is almost no way it was going to be warm at that point amongst other concerns.  The delivery driver expected the wrong pizza back so he could then take it to someone else. The fact that this was a viable option in solving the great pizza mixup is alarming.   Do not order from Gus's. Who knows, maybe your pizza could have come from someone else's fridge.",

    "text": "This place has sucked for years.  It was a sh!thole 20 years ago in the mid-90's but did the job for a late night slice after you've been at the bars. I haven't had this pizza in years - I have no idea how long - well over 10 years.  My current gripe with them is the constant flyers that used to appear on my gate each week.  They stopped for a while after I bitched to my Property Management that over-flyering was not necessary given that half of them would end up fallen off our front gates and blown around the grounds.  It was like the dorm with all this non-stop flyering. There's 180 units in my condo community ...they were flyering nearly EVERY WEEK, and a lot of the ground level condos have 3 gates (front patio, side patio, and back patio that's on the side of the building), and the idiot flyer guy can't figure out that a side gate, and/or a back gate that doesn't have unit number above it, doesn't need a flyer, but some condos would often get flyers on two gates, and on some rare instances, all three gates had a flyer.  I did a rough estimate about how many flyers they were leaving in my condo community over a year ...it was well over 9,000 flyers a year.  Are you f'ing kidding me Gus' ? Finally the flyering stopped after I endlessly bitched to my HOA, but then the flyers resumed again a few months later.  Eventually, they stopped again about six months later and currently I haven't seen a Gus flyer in months.    Hey Gus', we know where your crappy establishment exists if we need you, but I would NEVER order from this place based on polluting our condo community with weekly flyers ...and secondary to that, the hour+ wait time to get average pizza ...NEVER will I bother ordering from this place. It was a sh!thole in 1996 when I was in college, and it still is 20 years later.  The original location was a dump, but they moved over to the former Geno's cheesesteaks joint arond 2014, so I'm guessing the place is cleaning because that Geno's location was fairly clean and the interiors weren't the dump that Gus' old location was ...but guess what, I still will never order from this Sh!thole. Order from here if you wish, but your best bet is to grab a slice going in ...but don't waste your time waiting on a delivery when you're drunk late night ...just order from somewhere else and save yourself the aggravation.",

The piazza was burnt and the salad that was supposed to be topped with feta, olives, peppers..., was just a tin full of lettuce. I called to give the place the opportunity to deliver what I paid for, but the so called manager could care less. He said, \"You'll have to take that up with Grub Hub.\" Grub Hub is the service I ordered from. The manager went on to say that he is busy and can't talk to me. I am so disgusted with the entire experience. I will never order from that Gus's again.",

It was COLD when we got it and it was only cheese pizza.. they didn't carry peppers or cheese for it so that sucked. But 2 hours for pizza when the shop is two miles away? Ridiculous",

But what I found most perplexing was when I ordered, I wasn't greeted, I was just stared at. During the silent transaction I noticed about 5 employees just...standing. Thee only one I saw actually working was a woman with tattoos, she seemed very stressed and all over the place. Probably because everyone else was just standing with their thumbs in their butts.  I probably won't come here again.",
