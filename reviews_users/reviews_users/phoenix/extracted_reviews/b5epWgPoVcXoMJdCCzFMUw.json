    "text": "This place is salt in the wound from one of my favorite local restaurants closing last year. It's basically the fast food version of the same thing.   The concept is a good one: salads, soups, sandwiches. I welcome fresh, healthy options. But, be warned: if you order a large salad, you'll get the exact same quantity of mix-ins than you would in a small salad -- just extra lettuce. Now, let's think about that: it just dilutes the impact those mix-ins have. I find that a bummer.  If that changed, I would probably bump up my review because I do love the concept and I think the Italian soda mixer station is a rad idea! And, I love that their version of the dinner mint is a chocolate covered strawberry.",

The one star is half for customer service (the employees were actually kind) and the other half for the chocolate covered strawberries that came with our salads. Now I remember why we stopped going and will never go again.",

Everything came in boxed lunches with labels of each person's name, which everyone thought was great (considering every other food delivery comes in bags or a mess of plates). They have a wide variety of soups, sandwiches and salads - but, what I really loved was how different the selection was from your typical deli/cafe. Example: Thai Peanut Sandwich.. where are you going to find that?!  The customer service was awesome. They were thorough and very fast with their delivery, and even called the next day to check and see how the food was. Everyone liked their food and we all decided we would definitely use them again for our next work lunch. Even if it's not for catering or delivery, you should try this place.",

She didn't tell me much except that they had good food so imagine my surprise to see the menu with very delicious looking soups, salads, and sandwiches.

I do like the chocolate-covered strawberry that's included with each meal. And it's nice that they have a big charging station for phones and other devices!",

The issue I have with Zupas is that their bread is cold and if you ask them to warm up your bread, they won't.  Pair a warm/hot filling with a cold bread, versus on a warm bread and you will taste and feel a world of difference. I keep coming back hoping they will be able to warm up my bread but it doesn't happen.  I will be back in a year to give them another try if they are still in business.  In the meantime I will look for a similar place that gives me the option to warm up my bread.",

First, the menu is neatly organized. Sandwiches, first column paninis. Next panel, salads. First column more sweet, second column more savory. Third panel, soups.  The sandwiches are incredible. I had the Crab Melt. The salads are delightful. I had the Super Foods with blackberries, pomegranate, walnuts, spinach, other stuff topped with blueberry pomegranate vinaigrette. One of the best salads I've ever had.  The second day, (YES, I went back the next day because the previous day I sampled their...) soup! Homemade from scratch. You see, they have a combo special for only $8.xx where you can get a full sandwich and a half salad or soup. Or you can get a half salad and half soup. Or you can get a sandwich and a half soup. I had the sandwich/salad combo the first day. The soup samples sent me to heaven. I returned the next day.  Tucson needs one of these.  Next day I had the Thai Mango Salad and the Roasted Red Pepper Lobster soup. My wife had the Shanghai Chicken salad and the Wild Mushroom Bisque. So, so, so good. We also shared a berry creme brulee and a Rocky Road brownie.  They actually had fountain ginger ale. I've never seen that anywhere. That alone gets a star. And then you could squirt some Italian soda syrup in. At the soda station for free. I put in a dash of raspberry. Yum.  Tip: only get a half size for the salad and soup. I really do not see how anyone could eat a full size as the half size are SO generous!  5 stars. No less.",

I ordered a half BBQ salad and it was prepared in less than 3 mins, although there was nobody in line besides me at the time.  The salad came dressed a little heavier than I prefer so next time I'll order it on the side, if that's an option.  It was a good salad but not mind blowing, but the free chocolate covered strawberry was a nice touch. I'm sure I'll come back some day to try one of their many soups ... or at least for that strawberry.",

The 5-year olds working this evening (when it was slow and there were only a few tables occupied) took forever to prepare the food. When I asked if a particular salad was gluten-free, I got a long, long pause, then an uncertain, \"I don't think so.\"  When I asked what was in the salad that had gluten, the employee said it has cheese. The other employees in the food line were baffled by this concept, too. These people \"work\" in food service and have no clue about ingredients. The menu marks vegetarian options, but nobody has a clue what gluten is. (BTW, it is not cheese.) We dined in, and observed the employees chatting away with each other when there were no customers in line. Meanwhile, tables had not been cleared, and the items on the beverage bar were depleted. No lemon slices, a few dried out lime slices, a couple pats of butter. We were there for over an hour, and the items still had not been replenished when we left. Somebody needs to train these people and monitor their \"work\" - if you can call it more than just socializing with each other. Wonder what the manager is like if they hire this type of indifferent employees. This is not a place that's on my list to return.",

The service has always been great, usually above and beyond what you get in any fast, casual restaurant.

Also, with every meal you get a free chocolate covered strawberry and their soda bar is great! Lots of flavors to create your own custom blend drink and I'm a sucker for a vanilla, diet coke!

Ordered something else and paid extra for pasta. They charged 50 cents for about a tablespoon of orzo. What a ripoff! Loud \"music\" and ugly decor and plastic spoons that are thin and small. The employees were chirpy but brain dead and were more interested in talking to each other than in providing info about the soups or helping us figure out how to order. Which won't be a problem for us as we would NEVER go back. The strawberry was small and  withered and since it was free it was worth the cost but not more.",

No calorie counting for me! Haha! I like The Try 2 Combo for $7.99 which includes a Whole Sandwich: Half Soup/or Half Salad. THE BEST PART IS THE CHOCOLATE DIPPED STRAWBERRY included with every meal purchase.  The variety of soups are great & they provide taste cups if you want to try any before deciding on your soup choice, my favorite is Wild Mushroom Bisque. They have a good selection in salad options as well, my favoorite is Pina Colada Chicken Salad. For the sandwiches, I usually go with Pesto Chicken Panini. The desserts always look so delicious & I have on numerous times gave in to the \"Low Fat\" Berries & Custard Cup/Tart.  It's a quick and easy place to grab lunch on the go or to sit down with friends and enjoy. They have choice of inside & outdoor seating. It is a bit noisy in there, but tolerable. I agree with another reviewer, that the overwhelming greetings from all the workers is a bit much. Overall, I like the place & will be back for many more lunches.",

I like that food is made to order and that their lunch meat is not over processed. I was expecting the salad and soup combo to be a smaller version half and half, but it was the WHOLE thing. That is amazing for the price and it is decent fare.  Enjoyed the Italian Soda mix in's. But, as someone else said fresh brewed iced tea would be nice.  This is a great location for them and I see that they have ventured into something that just may stick in a strip mall back corner....we shall see. Oh and ask for a chocolate covered strawberry they are awesome! A tiny notch down from Wildflower or Nordstroms Cafe (why the 4 star)...but a good soup, salad, sammi place none the less.",

I got a huge pina colada salad and turkey cranberry sandwich with a bit of italian bread and a chocolate dipped strawberry for around $8. I would recommend the turkey cranberry sandwich- it's fresh and crunchy with the cucumbers and sprouts. They went a little heavy on the cranberry spread, but it wasn't overly sweet or anything so it was fine. I wouldn't really recommend the pina colada salad though- it had components I enjoy but it wasn't the greatest together. I generally like my salad dressings to have a little kick or tang to them, but the dressing was faintly sweet, not that flavorful and had this really unappealing creamy-but-clear consistency. I sampled the Wisconsin cauliflower soup- tasted really great but if you're a textural person and prefer smoother soups, be warned, it's a little gritty almost. The chocolate covered strawberries are amazing- you can't really go wrong with that. I definitely will try the desserts next time (creme brulee everything!) and I'll be back- for the price, you can't go wrong!",

It's basically a fancied-up paradise bakery with better food, bread, and condiments. Oh and better prices too. I had a small Chipotle Chicken salad and a small tortilla soup and that was a good amount of food- with a drink, for only $10.58. The soup was great! And they let me sample several kinds before making my decision. I also loved that they had at least a dozen different kinds of hot sauce bottles on the wall that customers are free to use as they please. I tried three because I like to bring the heat and because they were available.    My only complaint was that the dirty dish bin was overflowing even though the place was super slow. Can't someone handle that? Its gross to have to move other people's dirty dishes around in order to fit yours in there. Ts seems like an easy thing to fix- someone pick up dirty dishes every couple of hours or something.",

My favorites are the wild mushroom it is very creamy and has a great flavor. The shrimp and sausage gumbo is very hearty with just a little New Orleans kick! I recommend them both! If you enjoy tomato soup theirs is a tomato basil and it is yummy!. One thing I really liked is that you can taste the soup before you order it! Bonus they have 8 varieties of soup to choose from!  I had the turkey pesto artichoke panini as well it was very good. You can get a 7.99 combo of any 2 items soup, salad, sandwich. By the way it's not 1/2 sizes with that combo either! I got a full panini and full soup.  The soda bar is nice to you can create your own drinks!  The ingredients are fresh and the employee's are very friendly.   They also cater which is a big plus!",

I LOVE the Honey Bacon Club (Turkey, Bacon, Ham, Tomatoes, Muenster Cheese and Honey Mustard panini).  I've had the Turkey Bacon Avocado Club and had bites of the Ultimate Grilled Cheese and the Vegetarian sandwiches The Boy ordered but none of them compare to my HBC! :)    I also love that you can try AS MANY SOUPS as you want before settling on one.  AND there are toppings for your soup!! Cheese, tortilla strips, sour cream, bacon... My favorite has been the Wisconsin Cauliflower - which is like potato soup except it's cauliflower instead of potatoes.  All the soups come with a generous hunk of tasty bread AAAAAANNNNNNNDDD a chocolate dipped strawberry.    Just writing this review makes me want Zupas for dinner! :)   SO - why only 4 stars instead of 5? Well....its the service.  Maybe they're over-staffed because they just opened and they're training people, I dunno, but the amount of workers there wanting to take your order, say hello, wish you a nice day, etc....is overwhelming to say the least and slightly annoying.  I also appreciate the gesture of having one worker walk around (or wander aimlessly) and clear your trays for you, BUT - it makes me feel like I'm being watched while I eat.  I'm hoping they reduce their staff as they get used to their flow of traffic.  Otherwise, I'll be taking my food to go! :)",

    "text": "We were excited to try Zupas because we are huge fans of soup and thought it might be like Zoup! in the Northeast.  It's not like Zoup!, because soup is not the main focus.  When we asked about Vegetarian soup we were told by two employees that the green leaf identifying vegetarian soups on the menu doesn't consider chicken stock in two of the \"Vegetarian\" soups. A third employee said that the green leaf meant no chicken stock, but I am now weary about this labeling.    The cafe is clean and bright and there's a docking/charging station for laptops. Good location, although the parking lot is always packed.  The staff was friendly and busy, but they didn't keep orders in order on the assembly line, which was kind of weird and inefficient.  You basically have to re-state your order at the register so that they can find your food.  The price was good for the quality of food. We ordered the Red Raspberry Spinach Salad (dressing on side), Vegetarian sandwich (white bread is only option), Tuscan White Bean & Vegetable soup (Veg), Wisconsin Cauliflower (mystery stock \"Vegetarian\"), and iced tea (unsweetened Nestea from fountain).  The chocolate covered strawberries they included on our tray was a nice touch.  All of it was good!  Recommendations to Zupas: educate staff about labeling on menu, offer whole grain bread for sandwiches and soups, swap out styrofoam water cup for paper, and fresh brewed iced tea would be nice.  Zupas could easily get 5 stars!  We'll be back for salads and soup, but until Zupas offers whole grain bread we'd rather get sandwiches at Wildflower or Paradise.",

So I often have to sacrifice quality for cheapness.  But even when I do become wildly successful, (hopefully exactly 2 weeks after receiving my bachelors degree) I will still remain frugal. I will still have my coffee can of coins and I will still refuse to throw a penny in the pond. Like my depression era grandparents I am going to be that insanely eccentric lady that hides money under the floor boards but don't tell anyone.    So the cheapness of the food was awesome. I only went there a couple of times because I had to head back to Detroit where unfortunately, they do not have a Zupas.   The times I went there I got the soup and salad. The salad was pretty amazing...I expected to be kind of spicy because hey it had the word \"Thai\" in it but it had more of a kick than I was expecting!   This is not a bad thing. I think many restaurant owners assume Americans cannot handle spicy and they might be right. In my case, I think people underestimate me...when I ask for spicy I mean it.    I also had the Yucatan Chicken Soup. This also had something of a kick and is AWESOME!  The people are super friendly, and even gave me directions. Let's just say I can be um \"directionally challenged\" and I don't have a car so I either walk or take the bus. I prefer walking and every time they pointed me in the right direction. :)   I wanted to get the desert but the only reason I didn't was because it was the most expensive thing on the menu!",

    "text": "1st time eating in at the restaurant.   Very good build your own salad. Found Tuscan White Bean & Vegetable soup to be so unbearably salty that I could not eat it.  I had gotten an orzo add-in and tried to ascertain if it had added salt somehow ... or perhaps since it was from the bottom of the pot????  No help from employees ... no offer to try a different soup ... just defensive, uncaring people SO enjoyed the wild mushroom bisque with crispy onion add-in ... his was salty ( the way he likes) though not even close to the over salted soup I was served. Not interested in returning and would never recommend to a friend or anyone with heart, kidney, or any even slight health concerns.  too loud and a non-responsive, non-helpful staff;  couldn't get by the salt to say if the soup had any merits;  I had hoped they really knew how to use spices and herbs they keep secret  We had already picked some up and eaten it at home some months prior which is what brought me back. Went last Sunday for soup but they are closed on Sundays.  Would really like to find someplace to get great soups.  For now, as long as my health holds out, it's back to my own homemade soups.",

    "text": "Soup For You  Recently, my friends and I went to  Zupas for lunch. Zupas resembles a cafeteria-style, with fresh salads, soups, and sandwiches. We were greeted at the door as a  employee passed out menus to view while waiting in line. I choose to create my own salad  (half salad) and it was delicious. Iceberg lettuce, chicken, apples, cranberries, asiago cheese, topped with cinnamon pecans and pomegranate dressing.  Oh did I mention Zupas gives bread and a chocolate covered strawberries with every order.  Zupas offers value deals. The choose two deal (sandwich,soup, or salad) is fairly priced but the sandwiches are pretty average tasting, nothing all that special.  Maybe that is because they are trumped by their delicious soup (chicken enchilada chili).  The service is friendly and quick with no lunch line hold up. Plenty of seating with  employees who happily picked up our empty plates.  An excellent option for a quick, or leisurely, lunch that won't put a dent in your wallet.",

Here's what is in the Sandwich:  Creamy Chicken Salad w/Pesto, Almonds, Roasted Sweet Red Peppers, Muenster Cheese, Sprouts, Tomatoes  The Chicken is high quality...no fatty pieces.  The Almonds and Sprouts give it a nice crunchy texture when you bite into it and provide a unique flavor that you don't find in most Sandwiches.  It's really good!!!  Since that first trip, we've come by a few more times for a quick bite on the go.  I wish I lived/worked closer so that I could visit more frequently.  Return Factor - 90%",

It has been here for a long time,( maybe 3 years). It used to be the location of one of my favorite Chinese restaurants. I was so bummed when they closed down. Maybe that is why I waited so long to visit here. Anyway, I had taken my car into Discount Tire to have some work down.  I went across the street to explore. After a bit of shopping I thought I would give Cafe Zupa a try. Love it, Yes , Love it! It is a bit different but, they tell you exactly how it works. It is all laid out for you in order. They ask you to read the menu. They tell you how to order and you just go on down the line. They even tell you, when you are through just leave your dishes, they will clean it all up for you. Then they say,  please no tipping. The food is great!   Salads, Sandwiches, and Soup! I even got an order to go. I tried the Lobster soup whilst there and got the pepper lobster to go. Divine on both counts. Even free Wi Fi and a charging station. The rest rooms are very clean. Thinking of how many people are in and out of there during the lunch rush, I was impressed! I am really looking forward to returning and checking it out!",

So I'm in town for a few days and wanted to get some soup, and was recommended by a native to try CAFE ZUPAS and she didn't steer me wrong.  They had about 10 different soups to choose from, and not just your typical boring soups either. in addition to the soup you have CYO salad, you cant go wrong with the 1/2 and 1/2 soup, salad combo. We had the wild mushroom (OMG YUMMY), Chicken Chipotle (not for me but sis loved it) and the lobster bisque (this is why I'm giving it 4 stars) was too fishy. Now I'm from the east coast and have had my fair share of True lobster bisque from \"The Cape\" (cape cod for those of you who haven't been) so i feel i have enough to stand on to say it wasn't good. Other then that its a great place, food, service and clean!!",

I walked in and was immediately greeted by staff and given a run through of the menu (I told her it was my first time in). I did the $7.99 lunch combo with a sandwich and soup (you can also choose salad). I liked that you went down the line to order everything (like PB). I ordered the chicken pesto Panini and was able to sample soups before making a decision. I liked the tomato basil with orzo so I went with it. Then I saw the desserts and couldn't say no to some chocolate mousse. I got a drink and went to find a table. In the center of the restaurant, there is a technology center with small TV's mounted. I definitely thought that was cool. The drink station was behind it and I also liked the drink recommendations you could make with the different beverage options. Overall, I liked the food that I got, the chicken pesto sandwich had almonds in it and wasn't really a fan of that. The soup was good just couldn't eat an entire bowl of it. Unlike PB, they give you an entire sandwich and a big bowl of soup (with a chocolate cover strawberry). I left feeling extremely full! Overall, I liked Cafe Zupas and would return!",

The reason i give only 3 stars is that twice when i have ordered my mushroom bisque i got lobster bisque instead and i have seafood issues. In both cases i took the soup back to the counter and i kinda felt like they were looking at me as if i ordered wrong. The other annoying thing is there not being open on Sundays which makes me think they are owned and operated by the same religious group that operates chik filet.",

When I finally did call the corporate number, I was told there was no one I could talk to..... ???? What? What kind of customer service is that? When I asked how I was supposed to file a complaint, the lady told me to email the email address on their website. I informed her that I did that 2 weeks prior but never got a response. She said to send another one but that was my only option. I've never heard of such a thing. Do they not want people making complaints? Seemed very odd.... Especially with a large corporation/chain.",

In fairness the food was very good and quality, however the checkout procedure is a little mind numbing to say the least and the poor kid at the counter (because it was super busy at lunch) was a overwhelmed and slightly confused at my soup and salad. Overall Zupa's menu selection is good, the food was quality, the place was clean, they could just use a little fine tuning in the \"order to table process\" and don't be so worried about giving your guest an extra .0023 ounce of lettuce it made me feel like the cost of goods were more important than whether or not I was satisfied.",

    "text": "I had always assumed this was a Greek restaurant and never went inside.  To my surprise, it's a Paradise Bakery style sandwich, soup, and salad place!  My honey bacon club ($8.79 with the soup) was okay, but I can't even recall tasting any bacon now that I think about it.  It was VERY dry due to their choice of bread.  It was better when dipped in my bisque.  Unimpressive though.  The lobster bisque had very good flavor for being so cheap, but the array of veggies included (for texture?) was inauthentic and not needed.  They were a distraction from the lobster flavor, and the tomato, carrot, celery, and onion only added unnecessary bulk.  Don't expect it to be super creamy, as it was more watery than a True bisque (it's made with 2% milk instead of cream I bet).  The caramel creme brulee ($2.99) was fantastic with a crack of sea salt from the salt shaker.  It doesn't have the crunchy brulee part though, so it's more of a caramel-topped vanilla bean custard.  But creme caramel would be confused with a flan...  The complimentary bread and chocolate-dipped strawberry were nice touches, and in sure customers appreciate the wifi, charging station, and flavored add-in syrups by the soda fountain.  The pricing was very comparable to Paradise, in that slightly-more-than-Subway $10-ish per person level for a sandwich with soup or salad.  Parking can be a nightmare due to the Last Chance shoppers raging in the lot.  However there always is parking if you're willing to walk across the asphalt expanse a little ways.",

The turkey definitely tasted like ham!  As someone who doesn't eat any pork I was a bit troubled by this.  I went up and inquired about this, I was informed that the restaurant was testing a new kind of turkey, supposedly a higher quality ... but was smoked.    For any others who can't or don't eat pork you know smoked anything still tastes like pork, and for some the mental association from the flavor as pork is too much.  I let them know at least my feedback on this and that others who don't eat pork would at least appreciate smoked* being noted on the menu, as I would have avoided this dish.  Now, I believe I was talking to a manager, mostly because I have seen her working every single visit, said she appreciated the feedback and asked if she could make another sandwich for me.  Thank you Noe!  This is exactly what I consider excellent service!    While I am bummed my favorite dish has changed - I increased my rating from 4 to 5 stars because of the continued good experiences and now proven great customer service.",

Its' not that its bad-its just doesn't do anything for me, and I find myself at a loss every time I eat here.  I've been here twice now, and today was better then the first time I went.  Cafe is large, with ample seating and great decor.  Plenty of help, lots of people during lunch hour, staff is friendly, with plenty of menu options.   Most of the stuff is to odd for me, and doesn't hit the spot for what I feel like eating.  Cafe Zupas has quite a few healthy choices of food, from soups, to salads, and sandwiches.  I can do healthy food, and if the menu were more like Zoe's, I would probably be a fan.  Hot Lobster bisque when its 100 degrees outside? eh, no thanks.  A large salad with stuff I dislike on it? No thanks either.  I don't like funky salads!  I don't need 14 varieties of nuts, berries and weird stuff on it.  I can appreciate a good salad, but I don't want to feel like a squirrel!  lol  Anyways, today was fine, I stuck with the grilled cheese sandwich with a pop for a grand total of $7.30.   I was a little shocked because the sandwich was only $4.99..which means my pop was almost $2.00! I don't mean to sound cheap, but my coworker and I both wanted a cheap, light easy lunch, and we were surprised that it was so much.   Anyways, I will probably be back since we rotate this place into our lunch places that we eat at since its right across the street from work.  I definitely wouldn't go back on my own, that's for sure.  Even though I try to seek out healthy dining options, I'm just not a fan!",

    "text": "The restaurant was very clean, very modern, and well-staffed with bright smiling faces. The expansive bank of shining menu screens lit the entire ordering area in a sterile blue glow, and the eating area is deceptively large, bigger than the building appears from outside even.   The cafeteria-style counter gives an excellent view of the fresh salads, the soups are all well-marked and taster samples are freely offered to indecisive patrons. Initially I went for a bowl of Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup and an Asian BBQ Pork sandwich, and quickly devoured them both.   Unfortunately the meal quickly turned south on me, and my lunch was not enjoyed for long. I wasn't sure if I could cast blame for the sudden illness on Cafe Zupas (neither of my lunch mates got sick), so some weeks later I returned to the establishment with the same friends to further explore the menu...  A bowl of lobster bisque soup and a turkey bacon avocado sandwich this time, but ultimately experienced the same results. Quick-onset stomach cramps and the other lovely symptoms of which I will spare you detail.   As much as I enjoyed the atmosphere, menu variety, service and location, I enjoy not being sick much more. After careful thought and consideration, I think the food may not be entirely to blame. I believe it may be an reaction to the cleaning products they use for their soup bowls. I'm not going back to test the hypothesis though...",

I asked for feta cheese, she charged me .60 for about four baby chunks of cheese.  For some reason, she stuck a toothpick in my salad (to indicate extra?), but left it there. I was surprised to get it in my mouth. But not nearly as surprised as when I bit down on a rock. When my husband showed the rock to an employee, he said, \"Oh. I'll let them know.\" No sorry. No questions about what salad, etc. I can only imagine he tossed it in the trash and end of story. I hope not, but he didn't seem at all concerned.  The food was decent, the staff marginal (they were having a full on conversation about getting better jobs), but the tooth pain will keep me from going back.",

An employee opened the door for us which seemed like it annoyed her that I was looking at the menu that was outside, we walk in still looking at the menu and was asked for us to order I felt really rushed, and confused on how to order. I ordered the turkey bacon avocado sandwich which I tried really hard to at least semi enjoy it but it was gross. I also ordered the summer chicken salad which was actually good. My son ordered the grilled cheese and he took one bite and refused to eat the rest stating it tasted funny... Which my kid can be a picky eater but a grilled cheese? I didn't particularly  care for the environment it was kind of cluttered together in my opinion. I liked the salad but not enough to go back...  Arrowhead location",

My mistake for going here twice and having the same experience again. They left out some ingredients and when I went up to ask for what was left out, they treated me like I was a liar and proceeded to tell me the exact number of pieces they place in each salad. Um, ok thanks for the education and making your restaurant look pathetic. I guess you owe me 3 tomato halves then, because you gave me two tiny spoiled ones for my whole salad. What a great value. You also owe me a pinch of bacon, a peapod, and a teaspoon of shredded cheese.",

I got the Honey Bacon Club with a Tortilla Soup. 1st appearance after unwrapping the sammich, was,, wheres the meat ? only a couple thin slices of Ham, and few thin strips of Bacon.. (used to Deli places where they overload you with meat portions) and since catered, it had my lovely tomatoes on there ripe to pick n throw to the side... ok, on to the Bread / Panini, exterior was VERY powdered with flour to a chalky texture at times... That being said, Time to eat anyways... The flavors all stood out and sammich very well dressed and could even taste the ham n tiny bacon. Somehow this all evened out on consumption (except the flour exterior).  This was a very good Sammich that if lined, i would definitely get again..   The SOUP... oh boy, this soup wasn't much of a soup, more of a stew, plenty of chicken, tomatoes(yes yum), and the tortilla essence was strong, and actually had a great flavor over all, but hardly any Soup to sip on.. 2 things I would change, Tortilla Soups that i know have some kick, this had NONE... and of course the actual Soup part of Soup, would need to be more than 4 or 5 spoon fulls. Maybe in the restaurant, they had chili, etc to add.. will try again I am sure..   Worth the drive to get ? within 5 miles yes... Over 5 miles, you would need to be filling a craving for one of the items.. Good Luck and let me know what you think.",

I like that I can come here and order lobster bisque whenever I want.. it's hard to find in AZ but it's not super great lol. The grilled cheese was ok too.. my cheese wasn't melted and the sandwich was a little burnt on the outside(as if they put a frozen sandwich in the panini maker). Anyway, as I said everything was OK. They do have a cell phone charging bar which is a nice touch. I will be back to try the other selections but definitely Try it for yourself since everyone's pallets are different. :)",

No soup from a frozen block here or lettuce from a bag and you can tell the difference.  I appreciate when a chain sources locally, that's hard to come by.     This is one of my favorite fast-casual spots, they are based out of my hometown in Utah so I got my first taste of it there.   I stopped in for a quick and \"light\" lunch today but ended up with more food that I bargained for, and for a bargain at $11 for a half portion of their California Cobb and a half portion of the Wild Mushroom soup, and a drink.  They give you a small chunk of french bread and chocolate covered strawberry as well.  My light lunch was a not so light because I ate it all and left full.   They were hopping and the service was quick, efficient, and pleasant and I had my food and was out the door in under 30, so at least I got the quick part of the lunch right.      Another unique feature is their assortment of hot sauces and drink flavoring.  I skipped the hot sauce today but totally got my sugar fix on a big cherry flavored ginger-ale, and topped it off before I left.  Their desserts also looked de-li-cious, but I passed today..   Give it a try, happy Yelping!",

However, I just picked them out & it was fine. Wasn't the best salad I've ever had, they could put more chicken (more bang for your buck). I felt that this place was very pricey and mediocre, Your typical health food spot.",

Yesterday I asked if the dressing is gluten free. I've had the salad several times and never had a reaction but last week I got cross contaminated glutened so I'm hyper aware. I was told that their kitchen is not a gluten free kitchen, but wheat is not added to the dressing. Eight hours after eating my delicious salad I started experiencing abdominal pain. It has now been 17 hours later and I still have abdominal pain.  I am not mad at Zupas. I am mad at myself because the salad was good but not that good. Anyone with gluten issues should not dine here.",

Thank you for helping me serve and please my office and guests.  It makes me look good, too :)",

When it finally opened, it took me a while but I finally tried. it.  When you first walk in, the staff is beyond nice.  I was the only one in there when they first opened, but was greeted by literally, 10 people.  I even made a comment about everyone being there. I felt like a King!  Never have eaten here, I asked what was popular and what was good.  The girl  was great because when i said \"its ok to be honest..\" She was.   She recommended a salad and said I could customize to how I wanted.  There's a place in Chandler that I loved and I recreated the same salad from that place.  She nailed it.  The salad was perfect and when you go pay for your food they even throw a chocolate covered strawberry in with your meal.  How cool is that?  My only beef with the place.. and actually it's not the place is that it tends to bring in the snobby people in.   I had a near bump in with some guy who had placed is cup in front of me.. I had no idea it was there and said excuse me.  He grunted and gave me this look.  Wow.. ok man.  Chill out.  So if you want great sandwiches and salads.  I highly recommend Cafe Zupas.  Love this place and I will definitely be back.",

Sandwich was sliced turkey meat-like you get in the grocery store deli counter. The avocado was not slices of fresh avocado. Instead it was mashed avocado. The bacon was soft with no texture at all.   Then there was the soup. First of all, it was lukewarm. I had to ask them to re-heat it. Maybe it is just me, but I hate the texture of roasted red pepper soup if it hasn't been run thru the chinois. IMHO, it should be run thru the chinois to give it a smooth, creamy texture.   Just an overall disappointing visit.",

Paradise isn't bad, but there's just nothing special about it.   There were several different kinds of sandwiches to choose from. I got the chicken salad and it was delicious. Everyone else really liked their sandwiches too. The salad was also really good. Not your typical garden or Cesar salad. I'm not quite sure what it was but it had chicken, tomatoes, and feta.. yummy. Now we must also discuss the huge dessert platter that was in front of us. It was filled with chocolate covered strawberries, brownies, cookies dipped in chocolate, and more! I've never seen a dessert try like that before for a work lunch. Of course, I had to try a few of the items and they were all so good!  I would definitely make my way to their physical location in the future so that I can try out some other items. And if you're looking to cater for a large group of people, definitely check this place out. Your guests will not be disappointed and it'll make a great impression on them earning you some major brownie points.",

    "text": "Sadly, I LOVE their salads but this warrants a 2 based on missing ingredients. The workers need to slow down and focus on each order. The last two times I have gotten takeout the salads were missing ingredients. The first time it was the Kale and Quinoa. I had to remind the prep girl to put the quinoa on the salad at the end. This time, again I ordered two Kale and Quinoa salads to go......Both salads are missing the cheese. Very annoying when that is a key flavor to the salad. They try and get you to move through the line so you don't see them making the salads. I arrive at work and am entirely disappointed. Sadly I will begin looking for a new salad joint. Bummer",

    "text": "This place is close to my work and after seeing it a few times I decided to go check it out. I have to say I was drawn to it because I'm Polish and zupa = soup. Cafe Soup! Why not, I'm down!  They have a great combo deal that I'll always get for lunch. You can pick two choices from either half a salad, half a cup of soup, or a sandwich. And then you go on down the line and run into their giant delicious deserts and you realize you're in heaven! Big thick brownies and giant slices of heavenly looking cake. And as a bonus even if you don't get a desert they give everyone a chocolate dipped strawberry as a small treat. That makes me love them all the more really.  I have to say that I haven't sampled all of their soups and sandwiches but from what I have tried I have to say the mushroom bisque is to die for and if you love grilled cheese you HAVE to try the Ultimate Grilled Cheese sandwich.   The service is fast, they have many people working behind the counter so you never get stuck waiting and waiting and waiting for your food to be prepared. It's a great choice when you need something quick and don't want to resort to a fast food drive through.   All in all Cafe Zupas is one of my staples if I'm having a lazy lunch day and want something delicious!",

Cauliflower soup... omg. Delicious. I talk about it still. I had the strawberry salad and soup combo. It was an easy 8 bucks. My sister and Mom had some other stuff, I was way too proccupied with my delicious soup to give notice. And it came with a dipped strawberry. heaven.  Is this place a chain? It is such a good chain if it is. Everything was great. My only complaint is that they're closed on Sundays. I hate establishments that are closed on Sundays, I think it's dumb. I drove my whole family here one Sunday afternoon, all excited to introduce my husband to the delicious selection and they were closed. ugh. We're going tomorrow. Maybe that will ease my bitterness of the Sunday thing and cause an extra star to be added.. we will see.",

Drinks are also excellent - yes its a fountain server a la any other sandwich place, but Zupas has Italian Soda syrups nearby that you can pump into your drink, turning a coke into a Strawberry Cola, or a Ginger Ale (I have not seen this on soda fountain before) into a Raspberry Ginger Ale. Kids giving you trouble?  Got an iPod handy?  No problem - they even have docks and screens for the little ones to watch their favorite movies while you eat in piece. All in all a great place for lunch. Fair warning to weekend lunchers - this place is closed Sundays",

At first, I thought Cafe Zupa was a Mexican place or just a regular sandwich restaurant, which it is but, upon entering into the place I was immensely surprised by all the hip as I walked in, seeing how overcrowded it could get for lunch hour. LoL  I was also taken away by the choices they have for their salad bar and how fresh/colorful it all looked and their variety of sandwiches and also, their soup selection. Every bite was salivating worth it, plus to add the touches of their dinner roll bread and dipped strawberry and I just love love their selection of fountain drinks with their freshly made healthy drinks. WOW, so delicious and their customer service are always FRIENDLY and COURTEOUS.  I think since my co-worker has brought me here a little over two months ago - I have probably brought my family more than 4 times, lunch here is like at least once a week, and i've also used them for catering for our company meetings and EVERYONE just loves the salads, sandwiches, and all the added bonuses that came with their box lunches.",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 4.5/5 Happiness - 3/5  Zupas has been our go-to sandwich fast-casual place since we moved to Arizona. The food is just excellent. Everything tastes fresh, and there is a wide array of food (Asian flavors, American flavors, Latin flavors, and in the winters - stews and chowders)). You can get a salad, soup, sandwich or a choose-two combo, that is actually affordable (choose-two is a hair under $10.00). The salads are fine, but a little bland. So I usually go with a sandwich and soup. And the soup is absolutely the star, they always have layers of flavor and a very generous amount of stuff in the soup. Every order also comes with a delicious fresh roll and a chocolate-dipped strawberry.  The best thing is that my kids love it, and it's healthier by far than the typical fast food fair (i.e., nuggets). They go crazy for the chocolate-dipped strawberry - which I gladly prefer they eat to french fries. And you get a big bank for your buck (i.e., a choice of two of either soup, sandwich, grilled chicken strips, or mac and cheese - plus the free strawberry).  They have a fun soda bar with plenty of Italian syrups you can put in at no extra charge (as well as fresh cut lemons or limes).   The only reason Zupas misses five stars is the service. It has consistently diminished as I've been here. It is now taking me about 10-15 minutes to get through the line, which is ridiculously long for fast-casual dining. The last few times I have been, I have had to ask them to re-stock something (i.e., napkins, utensils, butter for the rolls). And they definitely are not as friendly as they used to be.",

I was trying to explain to her that I was being charged for somethings hat I didn't get and she wouldn't listen she just kept trying to get me to pay for it. She got into an argument with me. UNREAL! I ended up getting the bottom of a bowl of soup and it wasn't even filled to the top. When I addressed it, she took my bowl and said she would have to get my food from the back. I've never seen that at a Cafe Zupas before. I've literally been sick all day and night since I left. I don't know if she put something on my food or if I have food poisoning. But,  I'll never come here again. I go out of my way to drive 30 minutes here because I like the food. But, will never come back due to lack of customer service and now possibly being poisoned! The owner needs to take a good hard look at this.   Update: I am still sick to my stomach. Running to the back to get a new batch is one thing. But, she had already done that. She just gave me the bottom the first time and the second (after I brought up the situation) she had already refilled the soup. Therefore, there was no reason to go to the back. She was doing it out of spite. She never tried to make my experience better. She was outright rude and trying to provoke me. I called the store to speak to the GM, Taneen (at least that's what I was told her name is). Two days later, no returned call. I called again yesterday, no answer. Great lack of customer service and checking on a customer who was made sick by your store to see if they're okay. This is ridiculous.",

So yesterday (Nov 6, 2018), after maybe a year's absence, we thought we'd visit again for lunch.   Horrible. SUCH a dive to the bottom.   Service has been dumbed down to a pre-school level. Staff could not answer simple questions about ingredients.   My wife ordered Bistro Braised Turkey panini and a salad. I ordered a turkey sandwich and their seasonal soup special, German sausage chowder. We decided to share a Passion Fruit brulee.   My receipt said \"Cuban Grilled Pork panini\". My wife is allergic to pork products. Since the sandwiches look similar, I checked with the idiot at the cash register: \"We ordered turkey, but that looks like pork. Would you check?\" He glanced at the sandwich, said: \"It's turkey. They made a mistake on the slip. It's not pork.\"   Guess what: it was pork. They made the wrong sandwich, and the idiot at the register misidentified it. My wife took a bite or two, set it down, spent some time in the bathroom.   For my part, the chowder was WAY over-salted. Over-salting is a common failing here -- but this was truly exceptional. Made, perhaps, with sea water?   They served my soup in a paper cup. I said, No bowls? They stumbled all over themselves explaining that they had run out. But strangely, there was a whole pile of dirty bowls on the returns counter next to the soda dispenser. It was there when we arrived, and still there when we left.   G0d knows what was in the passion fruit dessert -- a yellow gel of Play-Doh consistency and some over-sweet chemical from U.S. Flavors & Fragrances, maybe, but no passion fruit. (I'm from the tropics. I know passion fruit. And this, my friend, ain't no passion fruit. Not even close.) Even between the two of us we couldn't finish half of it.   I read a whole bunch of reviews here before I wrote this one. Particularly the responses, which I looked at back to 2013.  Every reply is slick and PR-crafted to promote their imagined \"excellence,\" but not one addresses the actual issues except to say \"We will take this up with our Camelback location.\" Except, apparently, either they don't ... or Camelback doesn't listen. Or care.",

Since I'm Muslim (halal only), my options from sandwiches are the carb avocado melt (I ask them to remove the bacon) or their ultimate grilled cheese. I love both, just depends if I want some seafood or not.   Their soups are delicious as well. You can never go wrong with getting the ultimate grilled cheese sandwich with tomato basil soup.",

The sandwich had cucumbers, sprouts, tomatoes, roasted sweet red peppers, and greens. The sandwich wasn't really big on taste, but it was good enough for the price.  The mushroom bisque was bland, I had to add salt, pepper, and a couple of different Tabasco sauces to get it to where I actually wanted it, and it was surprisingly low on actual mushrooms...I think I had maybe 2 mushrooms in the entire bowl.  I will say that the Pomegranate Coconut Water Green Tea was awesome, I'll go back there for this alone!  The meal here wasn't \"bad,\" I would just describe it as being meh. I would put Cafe Zupas on the same scale with Panera, a couple of steps above hospital cafeteria food fare. Nothing to write home about, but decent enough to put something healthier than average in your belly.",

I didn't like the small tablespoonful of everything they sprinkle on. Seems a bit skimpy and had to double down. It was tasty and quick!

Well Zupas let me down they cut down the salad add ons, there is basically nothing to really make a create your own salad.,but.....the sandwich is still delicious along with everything else.. ZUPAS NEEDS TO BRING BACK ALL THE ADD ONS FOR THE SALAD... As for the service of the employees was excellent they were professional and friendly and they were very knowledgeable about the station they were at  and the place is very clean but.... By the soda fountian the floor is wet gotta be careful walking to and from there... And that is the reason for my 3 star. Thank you Zupa Employees for all the work and effort you all put into making the customers happy your all appreciated by my family and I... Thank You again",

The place was quite slow so I am sure the staff was bored but the chatter, cursing and loud voices were very distracting. I was with my parents, wife and 2 kids. I am glad my kids could not understand what they were saying because I would never want them to repeat it. Just a disappointing experience and dinner.",

I don't know mabye they are charging for water know. But you can't expect me to belive that the tax was $5.51. For my pick two I got a sandwich and soup. The sandwich was the crab avacado melt. It was absolutely horrible I do not recommend this to anyone. The crab lacked any and all flavor. The bread was warm but bye the time I sat down the whole sandwich was mushy it was so repulsive I could only take a few bites. Know for the soup I orderd the lobster bisque which claims to have real lobster carrots tomatoes celery onions and fennel LIES LIES LIES. all it was and tasted like a tick pasty broth like the  consistency of gravy. In all honestly the flavor of the soup was okeay but was very upsetting that None of the Ingredients you say are in their are actually in their. And to top it off they changed their bread slices witch were awsome to this cheep dryer out bland flavorless roll. They also have employs handling money then touching your with out changing gloves come on know that's just discussing I don't want other people germs on my food. My office always has zupas cater I'm going to make sure out next office party we take our business elsewhere along with my family and friends. Such a shame I really used to enjoy going there.",

    "text": "Soups and sandwiches are a simple, satisfying combo. When I spotted this place in the Camelback Colonnade, I had no idea what type of restaurant it was. Since I was starving and wanted something healthier than the pizza my boyfriend kept suggesting (NYPD is always tempting).  I figured anything with the word \"Cafe\" in the title might have something nutritious?   Upon walking in this brightly lit restaurant, I could tell it was a chain..but I don't mean that in a bad way. Like the other reviewers, it reminded me of Paradise Bakery. They have a standard list of sandwiches and many soups to choose from and everything comes with a chocolate dipped strawberry.   The staff is super friendly and helpful, no complaints there.   I ordered the Vegetarian Sandwich and attempted to order the Cauliflower soup. Sadly, they were just about out of the soup I wanted, so I opted for mushroom instead. What I liked is the numerous amount of soups that are vegetarian friendly. (Comparatively speaking, Paradise's super delicious tomato soup isn't? Imagine my disappointment finding out that.) Anywho!  Boyfriend ordered the Asian BBQ pork and tomato basil soup. Both of our meals came out quickly and were super delicious. The vegetarian sandwich is a pretty easy peasy sandwich, tough to screw up unless you're using gross veggies.  Side note? The soda fountain is pretty cool. While I rarely drink soda, I definitely enjoy a coke here & there. They have the option of adding Italian syrups to your soda! Instant \"Italian soda\", if you want to call it that..they did. I don't know if I really agree.    The only \"meh\" part of the meal was the chocolate dipped strawberry. I didn't find it all that impressive-the chocolate had a weird flavor. It was free there, so I can't knock them too much.",

I gave this location a 3 stars because I love the food, it's always fresh and the restaurant is clean when we go in for lunch which is why we keep coming back.  But good lord, the customer service is downright terrible every single time. Previously We called to see if we able to place an order over the phone in advance because there were a few from the office looking to order and thought it might be easier, they told us no that we would need to place a catering order and the next one available was 1 hour and 45 minutes away.  We didn't want to cater because we all had separate individual orders so we thanked them and hung up. Flash forward and we're actually in the restaurant and once again they tell us we need to go place a catering order and wait 30 minutes? We just wanted to order like normal, so we politely refused and did just that and ordered individually.   Today when i went in, the man at the start of the line asked me what he could get me and when I went to start ordering he interrupted to start talking to the coworkers gathered in a huddle next to him and ignored me. Then goes back to me almost annoyed that I'm standing there. I'm a little taken aback but whatever, the next guy asks what I want I tell him cashews and he tries to put pistachios on my salad and I politely stop him and say \"no, sorry, cashews\" in case he didn't hear me correctly. He replies \"right\" and looks at me like I'm dumb and still tries to put pistachios on my salad so I say more loudly, \"Not pistachios, cashews\". This earns another look.  I'm finally done getting my order heading towards the door and two gentlemen are standing there shooting the shit, one of them half assedly opens the door for me and as I'm saying thank you he lets the door swing shut on my shoulder. He goes \"Oh sorryyyy! Anyway\" and goes back to his conversation.  I'm blown away at the lack of customer service they provide here. Probably won't go back for awhile.",

    "text": "It was okay, a bit inconsistent. I got the lunch combo - soup and salad. The salad was called \"nuts for berries\" or something along those lines, and it was very strange. It tasted like cereal. How can salad taste like cereal right? My lunch date was very skeptical when I described my salad in that manner, so he tried a bite and his response was \"wow it does taste like cereal\". Strange and not in a good way.   But the soup I chose was good - Wisconsin cauliflower. Although I did not see any cauliflower in my soup, the cheese taste was really great. This earned the place 2 stars.   I gave them a 3rd star because they give you a chocolate covered strawberry at the end and that made me happy.   I probably would not return here though.",

However, living in Central Phoenix I tend to favor a less \"corporate\" feel in a restaurant's ambiance. That's probably the only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars. Also, the parking is not the best because they are sharing a lot with Last Chance, c'mon!   Aside from that, here are all the things I enjoy about Cafe Zupas:  -The entire staff is friendly. Every person smiles at you, and is kind. I like that. -The food is great and fresh. I have tried a few of their salads and sandwiches and have never been disappointed. In fact, when I'm craving a \"good\" sandwich I come here. Their panini's are hot and full of flavor (I was in tasteful heaven eating my turkey spinach artichoke panini today).  -It's a nice plus that a chocolate covered strawberry comes with any salad or sandwich.  -I respect that they're closed on Sundays.   All in all, this is a solid food establishment, and I will continue to be a return customer.",

They always have about 10 choices of soup every single day that you can choose from and you can be sure that your favorite is always one of the ones offered you don't have to wait for a particular day to get the soup that you like!   I would like to give a special shout out to the manager, Shane, he is so personable and helpful and friendly and makes every time I visit this restaurant such a pleasure! I had surgery a couple of weeks ago and I called the restaurant to see if I could make my order ahead of time and send one of my kids inside to get it and he told me that it wasn't necessary, he came out to my car, took my order, and my credit card and then delivered my food to my car in about five minutes  Thank you very much Shane for always going out of your way to make your customers feel so important and so special!!!!",

The salad (strawberry fields with chicken) was so good. Had a great balance. I went with the Wisconsin cauliflower soup as well. What a great choice. It was a great blend of cheese and cauliflower. Yummy. Thanks again Shane, I know my soup was made from scratch that morning.   My daughter got the pesto sandwich and it was great and the Cobb salad looked mighty yummy as well. I'd recommend this place for sure.",

They have so many different sandwich, salad, and soup options. I chose to order the combo where you can choose 2 of the following: a whole sandwich, half salad, or half soup. I ordered the turkey spinach artichoke sandwich and half of the chicken enchilada chili soup. I was impressed with the service! When ordering, none of the employees rushed us for our decisions. In addition, I haven't seen this anywhere else, but they allow you to try the soup before choosing one! (The lobster bisque was also delicious).  In addition to the sandwich and soup, you get a piece of bread and a chocolate-covered strawberry. Honestly for ~11 dollars, it was a good amount of food. I would definitely revisit this restaurant! My only complaint was the cashier. She counted my change wrong and instead of giving me an even 10 of change, she gave me 9.99 when I was trying to get rid of coins. A mistake can happen to anyone, so I don't think much of it, but would just caution them to pay attention when given cash!",

Now I understand they are a business and want to make money, but I'm not going to be nickeled and dimed for every single item. Their new menu \"showcases\" these amazing protein bowls as an option for the Try 2 Combo, but at the top it says it's $1 extra for these - yet on some of the items it also shows $1 extra (I've learned that's for steak items). I can't deal with shady businesses that don't bother to tell you, \"that's going to cost extra\" (shout out to Chipotle for their transparency!!!)  I expected to pay about $20 for my 2 meals and get to pay and see three $1 up charges. I questioned it and then get Shane, the jerk of a manager (had an issue before where I had to deal with him on the phone, and he pissed me off then, too!) Well, Shane didn't disappoint in person either, he was just as rude as he was on the phone. Sadly I have gift cards there, and I don't even want to go back with FREE money because of all the headache and disappointment they provide.",

The girl who seemed to be in charge was very rude and dismissive about telling me that it wasn't possible, she didn't even bother to turn around from her cleaning to tell me so. I tried to explain the situation to her despite the pain in my mouth, and she simply did not care. I ended up just paying for two containers as separate items and it cost me about $5 more. I would have even been just fine with it if she had apologized for that being the case, or even turned to speak to me. Just left me with a really bad taste in my mouth.  I will add, that the person who was actually serving me was very nice and polite and seemed bothered that he wasn't able to do anything to help.

    "text": "Ever been to Paradise Bakery? It's the same thing ...at least to me.  I got the Thai Chicken sandwhich and half Thai salad. FYI - the half salad is HUGE! I felt rushed to order, so if I knew the Thai salad came with iceburg lettuce, I would've passed on it. The Thai chicken was ok, had a slight kick. I didn't like the huge bread, it almost took over the inside flavors. The order comes with a chocolate covered strawberry and a slice of french bread. WAYYY to much bread in the meal.  It was okay atmosphere, pretty up to date. But why the hell is the drink fountain in the middle facing the other side of the room? I thought I lost my coworker when she got her drink. I didn't see where she went. LOL  This place is egh. I grabbed a to go menu so next time I go, I can take my time looking it over and try something different before I get there.",

My husband and I weren't even hungry but we decided to share something just to give it a try.  We had the soup and salad combo which at half off cost around $4 and some change!  We got the White Bean & Vegetable soup because it was both gluten free (hubby) and vegetarian (me).  It was very tasty.  I wasn't expecting much and really liked it.  We also had the berry salad.  It had blueberry, strawberry, raspberry and pomegranate as well as finely chopped cinnamon almonds and a lemon poppy seed dressing.  It was really good.  I didn't think the chocolate dipped strawberry was that great.  Didn't taste overly fresh to me.  But the slice of bread that came with the soup was DELICIOUS!  I would go again.  And will be even happier if they have fresh brewed iced tea.",

    "text": "I've been eating here occasionally for years because it's in my neighborhood, and while I like the healthier options and variety, there are some things that consistently bother me enough to write this review. First, the first employee I place my order with should enter it in a system for everyone else on the line. Don't make me repeat my order three times to three different people along the line. This makes the line slow, adds room for error, and annoys the customers, especially when they're ordering for multiple people. Second, stir the soup up better before serving because it's often not hot enough and/or you don't get a decent amount of the ingredients sitting at the bottom of the pot. The tomato soup is way too sweet by the way. Third, more often than not I find the portions chintzy for the price.",

If you had to compare it to something, the closest I'd say is Paradise Bakery. Differences: large and creative dessert selection, better soup selections too. The desserts aren't bakery style, most of the offerings were brulee, mousse, and fruit tarts. It has more lighting and modern feel to it as well.   The sandwich offerings are pretty similar. The only reason I gave it four stars is the turkey cranberry sandwich I had was great, but the cucumber on it made a bit of an odd combination. Also the chocolate hazelnut brulee was more like a mousse, but still delicious (and very rich).  It was pretty slow most of while we were there, the staff were very friendly and everything was clean. We're looking forward to eating here again.",

The sandwich bread is soft, and complimented well with sprouts and cranberry sauce...perfection!   The clam chowder was not too thick or watered down, was the right consistency with the right amount of ingredients. The restaurant is clean, spacious and well designed. The beverage counters are away from the check out counters and complete with shots of your favorite berry flavor to add an extra kick to your drinks. Last, they have a nice selection of desserts for your after meal delight. First time here, but will be my new favorite.  The salads are unbelievable!",

The comparisons to Paradise Bakery are spot on, but each one has their niche. I liked that there were essentially make your own salads available, and everything in the salad area looked fresh and yummy. The half soup + sandwich combo was great, but too much food for me. I would LOVE if they did half a soup and half a sandwich. Oh, and the meals come with a chocolate covered strawberry on the side. I had what was essentially a grown up grilled cheese sandwich with tomato soup, and it was really good. The tomato soup came with orzo, but it was a tiny scoop of it and the orzo didn't add much so I'm kind of glad I didn't pay extra for it as an add-on.",

All other soups pale in comparison. It's delicious with an Asiago crouton.  The sandwiches we've tried are all good, but none of them truly stand out. That's the only reason why I'm giving them 4 stars instead of 5. The Mediterranean sandwich they're currently featuring is pretty yummy.  I love their soda fountain. They have a variety of flavored syrups, some of them sugar-free, to make your own Italian-style soda. I love Sprite with a bit of raspberry, strawberry, and/or blueberry.  With their you-pick-two meals you can get a half size soup, whole sandwich, and a chocolate covered strawberry. After a couple of trips the hubby and I figured out that one meal was plenty for the two of us. This makes it a very wallet-friendly eatery.",

    "text": "Sandwich. Salad. Soup. Yum! Yum! Yum! I noticed Cafe Zupas before they opened, looked it up online, and was excited to try something new in the area. Since then, I have been several times, trying different menu items, and each visit has been great.  - Yucatan Chipotle Chicken Salad: I really like this salad. I ask to add corn. Fresh and yummy with a little bit of a spicy kick. Win. - BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich: I read somewhere that this was the most favorite sandwich, and I can see why. Tender meat and a great sauce, balanced perfectly with the slaw and soft Ciabatta bread. Win. - California Turkey Sandwich: I don't like sprouts, so I got it without. Pretty simple, fresh and yummy. Win. - Turkey Bacon Avocado Panini: It was good, but not great. It seemed a little too soft. Like the heat of the sandwich made the inner side of bread mush. Meh. - Tomato Basil Soup with Orzo Pasta: Not a fan at all. I love tomato soups, but this one was just odd. Weird flavor, weird texture, way too salty. Bleh. - Wisconsin Cauliflower Soup: OMG delicious! I hate cauliflower, but I tried a sample, and it was awesome. I've heard that cauliflower cheese soup can taste just like potato cheese soup, and it did! Win. - Yucatan Chicken Tortilla Soup: A little too salty, but I still love the flavor. A little spicy, and the glob of guacamole, squeeze of lime, and tortilla strips help balance the salt. Win. - Chicken Enchilada Chili: Tastes like enchiladas in soup form. I love it. Win.  Bossman is one of the pickiest eaters I know, and he has fallen for the Honey Bacon Club Panini (without tomatoes) and the Tuscan White Bean and Vegetable Soup (although he said this is also a little salty - even for the man who puts extra salt on EVERYTHING)!  The fresh bread that comes with the soup is delicious. Slightly crusty exterior and soft inside. And who can complain about a chocolate dipped strawberry? Awesome touch!",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to participate in Cafe Zupas Pre-Opening event last week, and I have to say I was impressed!  The ambience was cool, and included comfy booths and a 'bar' seating area with ipod docks and a place to set your laptops.  The staff was friendly and helpful, and allowed me to sample several different types of soups before settling on one.  And the food:  Delicious!  I actually loved it so much, I went back the next day to try something else, and everything I tasted was fantastic!  The first day, I had the Yucatan Chicken Tortilla soup (with sour cream, cheddar cheese, guacomole, and tortilla strips on top!) and the California Turkey sandwich (turkey, avocado, tomatoes, sprouts, cucumbers, mixed greens, muenster cheese, and ranch dressing).  Both were absolutely amazing, and I also got a chocolate dipped strawberry on the side, which comes with any soup or salad.  For dessert, I tried the cheesecake, and managed to eat half before feeling like I was going to explode.  it was divine.  The next day, I went back for more and tried the Chicken Enchilada Chili (made with red and green enchilada sauce) and the Turkey Bacon Avocado grilled panini (with muenster cheese and honey mustard).  For dessert, I sampled the Mixed Berry Creme Brule.  Day 2 was also awesome.  In addition to everything I already listed, I sampled other soups, sandwiches and salads that all tasted equally as delicious.  For example, the Wild Mushroom Bisque is next on my list to eat, since the sample I had left my mouth watering.  The Lobster Bisque, Shrimp & Sausage Gumbo, and Thai Lobster Curry also tasted superb.  As for sandwiches, I'd like to try the BBQ Pulled Pork next....or the Turkey Spinach Artichoke grilled panini.....or the Ultimate Grilled Cheese.  So many choices!!  I also heard amazing comments on the Nuts About Berries salad, the BBQ Chicken salad, and the Pina Colada Chicken salad.  Basically, this is now my new favorite lunch place, and I can't wait to try everything they have to offer!  You should definitely check it out!!",

    "text": "Unsanitary food handling!  Went through the line and when I got to the cashier stand, the person assisting me was named Edgar. Edgar was also the person putting the strawberries in the bags and slicing the bread. He helped the person in front of me - who happened to be another employee. He took her cash and gave her change and then without changing the gloves he was wearing, grabbed the bread and sliced a piece as if he was going to put it on my tray. I told him I did not want that bread nor the strawberry and that he needed to change his gloves.  Edgar looked at me with surprise - not knowing what I was talking about. The lady in line behind me also told him that he needed to change his gloves. I then explained that it was unsanitary to handle money and then, wearing the same gloves, handle food. I told him I know longer wanted the food and asked to speak to the manager.  Edgar was very nice during this process and went to get the manager.  A minute or so later a young lady came through the doors and stated in a loud voice to Edgar \"What do you want?  I was on the phone with my boss!\"  Edgar then looked at me and said this customer would like to speak with you.  Tantine (the manager) looked at me and asked me what I needed. It was apparent that she lacks in basic customer service skills! I explained to her what happened and she just kept shaking her head and saying the word yes - as if this is a routine practice.  Tantine was very nonchalant about the whole situation and stated that Edgar was still in training.  I asked her twice for her bosses name and she refused to give it to me on both occasions - stating that the bosses don't like for their names to be given out.  Perhaps that's because no one wants to be held accountable for the lack of sanitary food handling processes at this restaurant?    With so much news about people getting sick because of poor handling of food and overall sanitation not being up to standards, you would think that there would be more vigilant training conducted and certainly more empathy on the part of managers. Maybe there is elsewhere but certainly not at this location!",

You can't  just get plain oil and vinegar....only several sugar sauce options.  I went with the herb vinagerette and was mortified by how sweet it was.  They then give you a white, processed roll and a hard chocolate covered strawberry....so basically I ate none of it. My mistake, but I had no idea.  People seem to like all this as there were people in there, but not happy with my sweetened experience.   I went to their website, and of course any detail is not available...I'm sure because it's all sugar and preservatives.  Yuck.",

I am usually disappointed in lobster bisque, but this actually had the lobster flavor and small bits of lobster. Good salad, nice drink selection and Italian ice flavorings for your beverage, gratis. Portions with a salad and small soup were perfect! We got 2 choco covered strawberries-is that something they just do? I don't remember ordering them, but yum. It's an order at the counter place, and carry your food to your table, but the guy behind the counter saw that my mother was using a walker and volunteered to carry the tray of soups over for us. They have an outdoor seating area too. I am adding this place to my list of yummy food spots. Very reasonable too!",

You are handed a menu when you walk in and people stand around the line entrance figuring out what they want.  Once you know what you want, you can't just order it.  You have to walk through a hurried line where seemingly every person on the way asks you what you ordered or if you want what they have to offer.  You tell them what you want then at the end of the line, a disorganized pile of prepared dishes sits at the end of the line when you are again asked everything you ordered and expected to remember what the name of your sandwich, salad, or soup was called.  I agree with the other reviewer about how stingy they are.  For me it was the \"upgrades\" that I have an issue with.  None of their soups come garnished.  Want tortilla strips on your tortilla soup?  That's an extra $.69.   A Tablespoon of orzo pasta in our tomato soup?  $.69 extra per scoop.  All in all, their food is good, but these issues make me go here 1 out of 10 times I think about it.  Throw the crazed parking that Camelback Colonade offers and it's just not worth it any more often than once every few months.",

I brought that to the staffs attention, and they argued with me stating that was the correct amount. I mentioned that I have been there many many times before, and had always had a full container. They continued to argue with me. Really? they argued with me on a $34 bill over half a ladel of soup they have always put in there before. Needless to say, we used to go there weekly- been 6 months and have not been back since. Zupas, you may have tasty food, but there are plenty of places that value their customers, and you are not one of them.

So they complained while the servers were giving the soup because we were getting so little.  The workers were firm and said that this is the maximum amount we can receive in a bowl.  Seems silly to not give another half-scoop if your customers are complaining??",

I thought it was odd, so I moved on to the next order which requested extra tomatoes, to my surprise I was told they \"couldn't do that\". So I said \"charge me for the extra tomatoes\", I was then rudely told the register doesn't have a way to charge for that. Other people that were in line hearing this were shaking their heads, anyways I finished the rest of my orders and took my employees their sort of filled orders. The sandwiches were lacking in flavor, were small and looked like a car had ran over them. The soups were also lacking in flavor, tasted watered down. The ironic thing is I wanted to change it up and treat my employees and they just wanted Blimpies, I should've listened. They would've gotten their extra tomatoes and Mayo (what sandwich restaurant doesn't carry MAYO!!!!). I should've just left in the first place after the rudeness, but I had waited a long time in line because of the slow service. Needless to say, I will never return and don't recommend this food and service to anyone.",

I think the concept is similar to Paradise Bakery Cafe.  You place your order at the different counter stations, either salad, sandwich, or soup. However, they don't have a coffee station, wish they would, but do have a dessert counter.  They all looked so sweet & delicious!  A plus is while waiting in line, they give you different soups to sample.  I tried the Thai Lobster Curry soup, it sounded better than actually tasted for me.  To be safe, I stick with the clam chowder soup.  It was rich and good flavor, but loaded with more potatoes than clam meat.    All their soups include fresh bread and a chocolate-dipped strawberry.  You get to choose 2 combo for $7.99.  The sandwich came as whole not just half along with the soup.  Overall, an excellent spot to get a quick lunch/dinner.",

I came back another time while getting tires across the street and asked to taste two soups before ordering: too salty.  I believe it was the chicken tortilla or some variation of that and the Wild Mushroom.  Two times/two times too salty...no way.  Listen, I'm not buying soup unless it 's good, someone there is not tasting the food.  And if you watch the chef shows, that's a critical mistake.  SOMEONE HAS GOT TO TASTE THE FOOD.

Really how long did it take to train her to \"push and not pull the door open\"?? I would suggest other companies seek alternative catering needs. If this place can not recognize who brings in their profits. They really need to be relocated and bring in Jason's Deli, or Paradise Bakery who does accommodate the bulk of their business.

I tried the Tuscan white bean soup and my wife tried the cauliflower. They were both so salty we couldn't make it through half the bowl, there was no garnish on either soup and little to no flavor. We split the ultimate cheese sandiwich - also underwhelming, salty and reasonably bland. The beverage selection was poor unless you like soda and the staff seemed oblivious to anyone or anything around them. The best part of the experience was only having to lose $12 on the ordeal and the highlight was leaving.

    "text": "Tried this restaurant for the first.  Arrived around 1230p and there was a bit of a line.  Problem is, the line moves at less than a snail's pace.  I waited for over 20 minutes to place a quick salad order.  I opted to create my own but the girl who was making the salad assumed it was another type.  She added ingredients I did not want.  She did offer to remake but I had waited so long in line, I just told her to keep the extra ingredients on the salad and then told her what I actually wanted.  Much to my dismay, they charged me for the extra ingredients.  Salad was good but felt they should not have charged for their error.  I went to their website to let them know but there is no contact us option.  If you are in a hurry, avoid this place as it takes a long time to eat there.  Not worth the effort and I will most likely not return.",

The food was delish (the Nuts About Berries salad and the Honey Bacon Club) although the portions seemed a little small for the price. My only complaint is their Clam Chowder has onions in it. Yuck! Bonus points for real brewed tea and Italian flavorings for the soda. The layout is efficient, staff courteous, and interior design appealing. We'll be back.",

    "text": "This location sucks!  They have an employee that opens the door for you and is so blasted annoyingly fake trying to make you feel welcome. Then I ordered the Mushroom Bisque to find just a couple of pieces of mushroom in it. Who wants mushroom soup with no mushrooms??  What is the point? The soup looked grainy so I'm not sure if they used sour milk or what?? The salad my daughter ordered wasn't dressed enough and her sandwich was stacked so that the meat and toppings were only in the middle of the tasteless sandwich.    So in other words, you only eat and taste bread until you get to the middle of the sandwich.  How hard is it to make a sandwich???  In addition, the strawberries lacked chocolate.  My daughter thought it was just her strawberry and then I gave her mine and it was the same.  We normally order the soup and salad and this was the first time to try a sandwich.  This was probably not the location to try it since it was probably tasteless due to how it was made.  Just guessing............",

That being said, the food was great.  We each ordered a combo- all of it was great.  Samples of soups aren't advertised as another reviewer said.  I may go with this next time.  The mushroom bisque was SUPER.  Now that we have the ordering down (similar to Paradise baker- not sure where to order what) we will be back.  TASTY!",

It did not taste fresh despite their claims that all soup is made from scratch daily. The sandwich was terrible! The turkey was cheap, packaged, thin and filled with preservatives. The sandwich was made panini style which I was not expecting. What made it completely gross was hot avocado in the panini. Ick! My total was almost $9 WITHOUT a drink! Don't see the greatness in this place. Will not return",
