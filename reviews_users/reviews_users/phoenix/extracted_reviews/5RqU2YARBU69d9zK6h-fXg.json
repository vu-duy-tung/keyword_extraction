I had their mac n' cheese and it was delicious! Also, I had a happy hour beer for $4!  The place has two levels, where the bottom level is where people socialize and the upstairs is where people work. I LOVED that there were plenty of plugs for my laptop! It's a big plus when I'm looking for a coffee shop to work at.  I would recommend to friends :)",

(Btw i usually dont do this)  I come here any time from like 6pm-2am when is not so hot outside!  Ill start with the food and drinks. I ALWAYS get the mac n cheese and when im feeling wild, i try the mac of the day! The mac n cheese is a must try! They have a large selection of beverages but i stick with Lemonade. Lemonade and Mac is my go to when i come here.  Second but most important is their customer service! which most restaurants lack on. They have the friendliest employees! always smiling always in a good mood and they always make you feel like youve known them for years!!!  The only bad thing about this place is that its pretty hot at times idk if the ac doesnt work but it can get a bit warm in there specially around this time a year. But the night employees make you forget about the heat with friendly conversations and good attitude.",

I hope service gets better because that burger was so great. If I have a ton of time on my hands I wouldn't mind waiting for it again.",

The live DJ or band is a major plus! Usually, there is someone different performing every time I go. I haven't tried the food yet, but I will be sure to add the fifth star if all turns out good.

The first time the barista didn't know what Nutella was. -a fine ingredient for a new twist on a cafe mocha.  The second time the frapuccino was amazing.  The third time the cappuccino was terrible.  And served in a 12oz glass made with 4 shots (seriously?)    I also noticed Paella on the menu,  Odd for a coffee shop.   How about making better deserts,   or way better pastries and muffins? Or better yet,  add Pizza or Cornish Pasties to the menu!  And as a lover of finely crafted cocktails, is it True that the speakeasy section is only open 4 hours a week?   Seems like a silly waste of space.    Above all,  I wish you could bring back Amsterdam!",

You have to get there early to have less of a struggle to log in. Which is odd because a year ago I never had an issue. I typically study outside during the winter months I try to get a seat inside. The lighting is terrible. Very dim lighting on the 2nd floor which is dangerous because the 2nd floor has steps that you can't see.  I can live with dim lighting,  but what has been keeping me away from the Grand has been the WiFi. There have been several times that I come in, order my coffee, sit down and the WiFi doesn't want to work. I don't expect the staff to be IT specialists but I really wish they would fix this issue. I love this place and would like to return as often as I used to. I LOVE studying on the patio, but I can't afford to keep leaving because no WiFi.",

He stated \"the kitchen is closed guys I'm really sorry.\" Which was not impolite. However, a hello or some type of greeting would have been appropriate. We were not offered a drink or anything, the conversation went no further. Other customers had drinks. I don't know if we were just not welcome, or nothing was available.  The stars are for the ambiance. It was really cool! We walked through several rooms to get to the counter, and it would deficiently be a cool place to eat.  Unfortunately we will not be returning.",

The atmosphere is awesome, super grand (haha) decor, kind of a dark, old timey vibe.   They always have an awesome selection of beers, the mix drinks are super tasty, and they also have a lot of cool things going on with their non alcoholic drinks. The lavender white mocha is delish and I love love loved the rose lemonade, tho it can be a bit too sweet for my taste depending on who's making it.   4 stars rather than 5 because I've come here several times to do some studying and their WiFi never works for me. I guess some people have no trouble but for some reason I'm never able to connect, when I asked they said that just happens for some people and oh well basically.",

We ordered our food, some tacos, and we were told our food would come out in a few. Well, time kept passing by and our food was nowhere to be found. When we went to the front to ask them about our food, they said they forgot to put in the order or something like that. They apologized and said that the tacos they had made were for some managers. Okay... awesome.... what about your customers? It literally took them an hour to bring us our food.  My friend wanted to leave after they told us they forgot about us, but we decided to stay because we were starving.  I know sometimes people can forget things, but when your customers are hungry and have waited for an hour, do not say your managers get served before us. Just don't.   Overall, the quinoa taco was actually pretty good.",

In fact, the menu seemed drastically cut down, and the selection is just okay. Nothing really stands out anymore. Additionally, the floor servers (?) used to run your food to you, but now you pick up your own food from the kitchen counter. Not a bad thing, just a very noticeable difference. Finally, the AC upstairs is basically non-existent, so it's damn hot. Still love to hang here, but pretty disappointed about the changes. For that, I take back a star.",

    "text": "There are two things which Downtown Phoenix arguably has too much of.  Pizza and coffee.  There's a restaurant serving pizza around every corner and there's a coffee house around every corner (remarkably, not one of which is a Starbucks).  Let's face it, we all know pizza has no ceiling in America.  But increasingly it seems like the corner coffee house doesn't either.  To be fair, there's plenty about The Grand that differs from the numerous coffee houses in Downtown.  In fact much of what you find here is radically different.  I actually came here to meet up with a local organization for a Facebook event, but took a little time to peruse as this was my first visit.  The Grand occupies one space in what (until recently) was a row of nightclubs along Central Avenue just south of McKinley.  Amsterdam nightclub occupied this space for years with a couple of other nightclubs next door (both of which are still open).  Now this space is Downtown's newest 24/7/365 coffee house.  With relatively few 24/7 businesses Downtown, this is a welcome sight.  The space is enormous (at least 10,000 square feet) including a sizable outdoor patio on the north side of the building.  The Amsterdam space could pack in hundreds and so The Grand can at times feel pretty cavernous with a lot of unutilized or underutilized spaces.  According to the owners the inspiration behind the interior was that of Grand Central Station, with various time pieces and a menu board substituting for a train schedule.  That qualifies as different I'd say.  Up until recently the menu was pretty limited to coffee, booze, and baked goods.  Of late they've been slowly rolling out an all day food menu covering breakfast foods all the way through late night munchies.  I will say however that they're still a little disorganized on the food front.  Between the food menu, coffee menu, baked goods, and booze list, I feel like The Grand probably should change their business model to that of a full scale restaurant rather than a coffee house.  When I got in line up front to order my food, there was no menu to look at other than the one (and only) menu at the register.  There was a couple of folks in front of me and each (understandably) took well over a minute to look through everything and put down their order.  For a place as large as The Grand, it would be wise of them to instead just have hostesses find them a table and use waiters and waitresses to take people's orders.  Hob Nobs has struggled with a similar problem and it was partly responsible for a bad experience I had there.  After looking over the full menu, I went with their house made burger named (appropriately enough) The Grand Burger.  Also got a glass of New Belgium Blue Paddle Pils.  Total cost including tax came to $15.  The specs on the burger: ground short rib, white cheddar, a bacon-shallot gastrique, arugula, garlic aioli, and tomato with a brioche bun.  I was a big fan of the gastrique and the bun was toasted perfectly.  Tasty burger, though for $10 I was kind of disappointed it didn't come with a side.  At this juncture it seems like they're still feeling out the food phase of this place.  They're completely good to go as far as their coffee and the booze selection at the bar is pretty impressive (including more than 20 beers on tap, a dozen wines by the glass, and a fair number of cocktails to choose from).  But as I mentioned earlier it seems now as though The Grand is a full scale restaurant masquerading as a coffee house.  I get wanting to maintain that coffee house feel, but there's nothing wrong with just being a good go-to 24/7 restaurant.  With time, hopefully they'll get the logistics fine tuned.  I'll give The Grand credit for taking a big gamble with a 24/7 business that seems truly unafraid to take risks with their food and drink menu.  I hope the gamble pays off.",

    "text": "The Grand checks so many boxes for a downtown food/drink establishment, especially in Phoenix. The location on Central is amazing walking / biking / light rail territory. It stakes a big claim across from the very busy Phoenix Public Market and its Saturday farmer's market. The building is so beautiful inside and out. So much to explore, and is great if you want to read or work, and just as good if you want a night out on a gorgeous patio, or in an intimate sitting area upstairs. The food and drink selection is great, delicious, and priced very well. I have come here several times for a myriad of reasons.  However, just out of my concern for wanting to preserve good things when they come through Phoenix, ESPECIALLY a decent restaurant, Cafe and bar like The Grand: the service is always at least, a shit show. It's clear that there is a poor communication among it's many moving parts. I can't imagine how cumbersome that must be to navigate if the aim is to provide at least par service. Food always comes out at different times for every guest, even on the same ticket. Drip coffee once took us 30 minutes to receive. Staff tends to avoid eye contact, or any contact during this time, instead of some reassurance or communication that everything will be coming at some point.  So why do we go back if the service is a huge question mark? The food, drink, and atmosphere are really excellent. The menu is well designed. I just want to try and stick it out and hope the kinks work themselves out for a place with SUCH promise. Some evening and bartending staff are exceptionally attentive, so that's nice to see. It's unfortunate that all anyone has to say about the Grand is that service and communication are a giant question mark on any given day. I wish this place well and bid it adieu.",

It tasted like noodles and milk, there were other yummy looking things on the menu so I won't hold that against them (i have this thing about mac and cheese... it's complicated). My friend got fish that came in naan which she loved. Anywho, I had always hoped to find an awesome place like this here in Phoenix. A bar, resto, and coffeeshop all rolled into one, complete with a not-so-hidden speakeasy and connected to a full on nightclub that goes into the wee hours. Did I mention they also have a community stage? The staff is super cool too! The GM, John, is an absolute gem! He took us up to check out the speakeasy since it was open to the public that night. Once inside we were introduced to Nicholas, the bartender. He was fabulous! Funny, friendly, and makes a damned good drink. I can't wait to go back and explore The Grand a bit more.

They've got coffee, tea, and pastries to help you start your day or carry you through the afternoon, and then they've got a full bar and beers on tap to help you celebrate having made it through the day. The outdoor area is gorgeous, and I totally love the fountain that they have out there, and then for the ONE COLD DAY in Phoenix a year, they've got plenty of heaters outside to keep you warm. It's only a matter of time before this becomes the next \"in\" thing in Phoenix. I come here all of the time to work on a book that I'm writing and to enjoy a pastry and some chai tea.

Food was barely decent: I had the BLAT and the egg white was runny (undercooked) while the rest of the sandwich was just so-so.  My mom's scramble lacked flavor or character. The self-serve water was clearly from the tap and tasted moldy. Coffee was not anything special, which is immediately a bad thing for a coffee house. Overall, an average person could have cooked a better meal given the ingredients available. Service was lackluster in a disaffected hipster way.  The patio was in need of sweeping and table wiping (there was a cigarette butt on the table and another one under a separate table as well as other bits of trash, for example).  I would totally eat out on their patio again, if I could bring my own food and drinks and a rag to wipe off the table beforehand and didn't need anything from the staff.",

The avocado fries presentation --a handful of slices of battered, deep fried avocado on a large bare white plate and a plastic ramekin for the condiment--made the $7 dish look especially cheap. The server also failed to offer amends when the service shortcomings were pointed out.",

I've been coming here regularly since it first opened and it's been really fun to watch it evolve over the past year or so from a hidden gem into a very popular place for what seems like a mixed crowd of both locals and people visiting. While everything I've tried has been good, their prickly pear lemonade and white chocolate lattes are my favorite. Everything on their food menu is beyond delicious- especially their mac and cheese, which they mix up toppings everyday!",

It was minutes from Crescent Ballroom, which was so convenient. This place is beautiful! Big patio, quaint bar, cute upstairs area and they served restaurant quality food 24 hours a day. It was 2am and the food was incredible! I had a delicious, quality burger and Mac N Cheese. Also, they had a coffee bar with pastries and donuts. I gave this place a 5 stars for my first experience. However, a group of my friends and I came back to this place a second time at 1am and they no longer served food late night. In addition, they took the Mac N Cheese off the menu, which is a staple. We ended up leaving and going down to The Welcome Diner who serve until 2am! Had an amazing experience there, the food was sooo delicious and I loved the vibe! Definitely a spot to go to if you need late night food. Hopefully they bring the food back late night at The Grand. I've never heard of any other quality restaurant staying open 24 hours and felt that it really made them stand out. My group of 8 friends were really disappointed with the experience after I had talked it up. Unfortunately, we won't be returning unless they bring back late night food.",

Sure it's the middle of summer, but I see this as a marketing/quality issue. I tried a muffin and it was stale and bland, I honestly can't tell what kind of muffin it was. There is entire campus a block south of this place and customers will walk here if they have a quality product. Service was okay, no complaints but I wasn't particularly impressed. With so many great choices nearby they have a lot of work to do. On the plus side the interior is great and patio looks promising. I'll be back in a month to see how it progresses.",

First sign of trouble is that ordering must be done at the counter, right at the register so if you don't know immediately what you want, it's awkward to block the counter while deciding.  The paper menus are dirty and wrinkled with fingerprints and food stains on them.   After ordering, we were told that we must stand and wait there for our beverage order because, even though we were given a table number, they only deliver food to the table, not beverages.  Ummm,  okay. We ordered the mac and cheese of the day and two Yardbird sandwiches.   When the food was brought, the server apologized for the long delay and we were dissapointed that the orders were not as described.  The mac and cheese was a small portion for $9.00 and was missing the critical ingredient of bacon that was supposed to be in it.   The sandwiches were missing listed ingredients, the chicken on my sandwich was dry and chewy, there was no sauce of any kind and the cook had opted to add raw jalapenos to the sandwiches which were not supposed to be there.  Big Change. They did refund us the $ for the mac and cheese but the whole experience was unpleasant.  I would return to have a beverage and enjoy the decor but I would not order food there again.",

They serve alcohol, coffee, food and baked goods. The food was just eh, but the croinut was amazing. I ended up getting another because it was so good. I keep dreaming about it and will go back just for that sometime soon. Definitely recommend this spot.",

We had a mac & cheese burger and buffalo chicken sandwich, which were both delicious and hit the spot. They also had a great beer list. We decided to grab a coffee too to prep for the drive and ordered the iced lavender white mocha in their biggest size. What we got was practically a jug of the most delicious iced coffee drink I've ever had. The ambiance of the place was great too. Seriously amazing, would highly recommend!",

Waitress takes order and gets us coffees and pastries and leaves never to return.  My wife tracks down utensils and napkins - all why two guys\"working\" the bar, who ignore us without a hint of recognition, have a nice chat.  Breakfast never comes - we eventually discover it sitting on the kitchen counter. Cold eggs and bacon really hit the spot.  5 more minutes pass with the uneaten plates before us when waitress cluelessly asks \"how is it?\"  Girl apologizes - explaining they got \"swamped.\"  Frankly, she was working the coffee machine but that's no excuse to ignore customers from whom you took an order.  The bar guys, after 45 mins of accomplishing nothing benefiting their employer, then turn around and for first time say \"Can I help you?\" Apparently that's the appropriate way to greet previously ignored customers. Owner - I'd consider some personnel changes.",

I waited over 40 minutes for just the regular Mac & Cheese. When I finally asked the staff when mine would be ready they said \"it's right over there, I'll bring it to you\".... so when I finally got my food, it was luke warm at best AND some of the noodles were either over cooked or not cooked?? I couldn't tell which one other than they were crunchy. So I'm going to assume not cooked properly.   The only reason I sucked it up and ate what I could without complaining to the staff was it was Friday and it appears there were only two floor staff... TWO. That is absolutely ridiculous for a Friday and a day where most people have it off to observe Veterans Day. I felt bad complaining when I could see that they were doing what they could with the limited help that they had. Shame on management for not staffing more people and shame on the kitchen staff for serving undercooked noodles...won't be coming back.",

The atmosphere is probably better for nighttime - it feels dark and slightly dingy, not a good cafe vibe. All of the tables could have used a wipe down. I had a medium iced latte which was huge (24 oz?) and quite good. The food was disappointing. The BLAST sandwich (BLT with avocado and Swiss) was not made with quality ingredients. The \"swiss\" tasted like processed American cheese and stuck to the roof of my mouth. Avocado was a smooth premade spread and tasted like mayo. Bacon was precooked and dry. The beer-battered fries were served crispy and hot, but tasted exactly like regular fries. Would not make it a point to return.",

The Grand is certainly in its infancy stage but, if the coffee is any indication of what the final will be, they may just have a winner.   The Coffee House and Front Bar take up just a small portion of this large building. There is also a large patio with a window to the bar.  I attended an event here that included a complete tour of the large party rooms. There are three (at least that I saw). Excellent opportunities for large company or family holiday events.  The interior design decorations are large scale and one-of-a kind. Collected by the owner from NY to AZ. My assessment of the design would be \"large-scale eclectic.\" Antiques, modern, country, old world . . . a little of everything. But it all seems to fit and is very welcoming. He definitely has an eye for the unusual . . . and, yet, it seems homey and very comfortable. And, most of all . . . FUN!  The event I attended had food prepared by their chef. It was excellent. And the alcohol drinks on their menu board sounded fun. Just like the rest of The Grand Coffee House. Definitely worth a try. Watch for the Grand Opening coming soon!",

The atmosphere is what gives it a higher(ish) ranking. Good music, friendly employees, lots of table space to do work/paint/draw/ whatever hobby of yours you can do on a table. The thing that knocked it down is the price of drinks and food and the fact that you have to pay for the WiFi with an overpriced and honestly not that great almond milk chai. With that being said, I've heard the coffee is decent and if coffee places are your go to place to do work, this is a pretty good place to go. And apparently there's a room upstairs dedicated to like \"finding yourself\" or something and that spooks me just a little bit but go try it out if that sounds like your thing",

Special mention: the steampunked bike rack.  *** (3 stars) for cocktails, coffee, bartending staff and value (you are paying for location & ambience).  * (1 star) for food & food service (and that's being generous). Over-cooked burgers unappetizingly presented with wilted lettuce, house special bacon & chive mac and cheese that arrived with NO bacon, child's chicken tenders so over-cooked & dried out they were inedible. And the server seemed annoyed at every question (where can I find silverware?) or request (does this have bacon in it? Can I get bacon in it?), and getting the simplest things wrong (can I get a box? and being handed a bag).   I'd consider future cocktails on the patio - but I value my digestive system, so that's a hard pass on ordering food.",

Beautiful gates, waterfall and outdoor seating. Once inside yet again I was impressed. So much to see that my eyes didn't know where to check out first. Even the water that sits free for anyone needing to hydrate was beautiful. That however is where everything went downhill. I ordered a few different coffees both hot and iced, a tea, a banana bread , and two boxes waters. The iced coffee was bland, the hot coffee wasn't very hot, and the bread was hard as a rock. I was bummed. Service was just as bad. The employees were more interested in each other than helping take our order. The place was  pretty empty as is was early in the morning so that was sad. I even came back a second time to see if my experience would be any better and I was yet again hit with coffee that was just plain awful. Bummer.",

Such different flavors so creamy and herbal and just a perfect combination i got it with soy milk so it was even better. But that drink and the atmosphere here is worth 4 stars. The bar looks cool and so did the food, which I will try later. Also the fact that sanctum their hidden speakeasy-ish bar is here means that's their cocktail program has to be good, I'll try that too.

You can lounge inside on the ground level, or upstairs, or you can choose to sit outside on the balcony, or outside under fairy lights. Either way, the views are spectacular and are lovely to take in. A couple of people were lying down on couches and others were studying and doing homework, while others were chatting. It is a chilled vibe, and I  really enjoyed the atmosphere. (So much so that I spent 4 hours with my friends here!)  The coffee itself is more expensive than Starbucks, and is not nearly as strong, but the drinks are good. I had a Caramel Latte and it was sweet enough to be enjoyable without feeling like I was going to get diabetes. My friends had a cold brew (which was not as strong as they would have preferred, but still good) and a Mocha Latte (which was good but tasted more like chocolate than coffee). The only complaint we had was that there was a ridiculous amount of ice used.",

First of all it was the only coffee shop open before 7am - why no one in Phoenix needs coffee before 7am on a Monday I don't know.   We had amazing breakfast sandwiches, the aioli made it. Great lattes and tea selection. Didn't try it but completely intrigued by their Fruitty Pebbles latte.",

However, the service has consistently been subpar. Several times, the ladies working the counter have attitudes and are rude. One time in particular, one of the gals did not want to help us and then gave us an attitude for asking questions about the menu. Come to find out, she wanted to hang out with her bf in the corner (who also worked there) and eat food. On a separate occasion, one of the ladies working the counter was rude because we didn't yet know where we were sitting before ordering. Sorry, but not everyone figures this out before ordering and if that's an expectation, perhaps post it. Don't take that stuff out on the customer, that's your bad homie. Sometimes the music is good and sometimes it's super bad.",

Having never been in before we had a couple questions about if the place was open seating, where the menu was at, etc. the employee acted like he couldn't be bothered even though he was not doing anything at the time since it was fairly quite with little crowd there.   Complete turnoff when you go to a new place trying to give them hard earned money and a staff member acts like they could give a damn.

There are various rooms and balconies to explore, some of which are hidden away in unexpected areas.  There's even a huge ballroom where it feels like you're in a castle in Transylvania.  The florescent bar menu (they serve both alcohol and caffeine) is clever and fun, and my iced mocha was perfect - not too sweet, and comparatively priced with other coffee houses in town.  The large size of the place makes it so you can be close to the action (aka the bar) if you'd like, or you can have a quiet corner all to yourself.  I can't wait to come back and explore some more!",

The kale and blue salad is a great vegan option ( I'm not vegan, next time I would add meat or cheese). The salad was lightly dressed and the right amount of all ingredients that were present.   The really exciting part of this place is the atmosphere. It's HUGE with all kinds of different seating areas. Awesome patio. It's decorated in a very steam punk sort of way.   I think if you haven't checked this place out you should definitely give it a go!",

It used to be spectacular and really have a lot of delicious options!  HOWEVER, it seems recently everything has changed. They have slashed their menu and taken a lot of favorite items off. We used to SWEAR by the mac & cheese, which was definitely the fan favorite of my entire 15+ group of friends and work colleagues, but they've taken it away :( So, last time we went, we just got french fries. The girl at the counter gave me 2 different order cards, which made finding my food confusing, and I ended up waiting 30+ minutes for french fries. I continually went downstairs to check and had to ask after a while, since they weren't busy at all. The staff overall seems to have changed and they aren't the most helpful or friendly.   This used to have a great ambiance, with great music, employees, food, and drinks. Now, it seems to have lost every aspect that used to make this place different and great! Music is subpar, employees have been rude, almost all food items are gone, and our typical drink orders have been mediocre at best lately.  Honestly, I think our group will start meeting elsewhere, as we've tried going back probably 5+ times and each time has been met with complete disappointment.",

The object is to bring you a wider variety of burritos based off of size, price, and ingredients used by using a 5  scale. So without further ado, here is the breakdown for the breakfast burrito at @thegrandaz :  As you can see this burrito is bursting at the seams with freshly scrambled egg, but the True hero here is the corncob smoked bacon! The bacon was thicc -that's right with two \"C's\"- packed full of flavor and laced throughout every bite. The red skin potatoes offered quite a bit of mouthfeel but could have used a little love in the form of seasoning. The tortilla was fresh and grilled on a flat top to melt the cheddar cheese and seal all the yummies in.  Overall, if you're looking for a breakfast burrito that tastes truly homemade, then head down to @thegrandaz in downtown Phoenix to pick up this little darlin for $8.50  I give it /5",

This place has LOTS of seating area indoors, outdoors, AND upstairs. There's a good amount of outlets all over the place for your electronics. They are open 24/7 and since I'm a night owl, the time I've spent here is mostly late nights. The indoors is mostly pretty dark, but there are patio areas outside so if you are working here at night, it can be nice outdoors (yes, even in this AZ heat).  I usually order the iced mocha latte with soy. I've never tried any of the food items here, so I can't speak for those. There is a parking lot east of the coffee shop, but it's pretty small. My backup parking spot is across the street by the Phoenix Public Market, which is not a far walk at all.   Recommend this place. Love it. I will keep coming back as long as I live in Phoenix!  P.S. Make sure to check their website or social media accounts. Some nights, they have different types of events going on so if you're coming here to get some work done, it might be good to check out what they have scheduled first (if any).",

The cold brew and lemonade were made right after we paid, but the white mocha took forever to make. The rest of us were sitting outside and I remember going back inside looking for my sister because she hadn't come out yet. When I went inside I saw that her cup was still on the bar off to the side and we had to ask the worker about the drink, and they apologized for forgetting the drink. The drinks were okay, but for the price, I would have rather gone somewhere else, but since we were visiting Arizona for the first time we wanted to try it since the reviews were good. We didn't get any food, so maybe the food here is better than the drinks.",

The Patio is very chill but very dark with a bar that accessible inside and out. After looking over the menu we decided to order the Tacos. I ordered 3 avocado and my fiance ordered 3 Asada.   As we received our tacos the plate was hot but not so much our food. The tacos were lukewarm on both of our plates. When I began to eat my tacos I was not impressed with my avocado tacos neither was fiance with his asada. I wish the tacos were as good as the price. If in the area I will definatly make another stop in to have a coffee or a beer because I did like the vibe of the place. I'm not to sure if I would try the food again.",

Also when ordering the staff was not helpful. I told her it was my first time here and I would order when ready. Although she was patient she did not have an attitude that would make me want to come back. Customer service upholds a reputation of any business for that reason of many I won't come back.",

What it doesn't tell you is the kitchen closes at midnight on weekdays and 2am on weekends.  Plus, their espresso is made with burnt beans.  Their pastries would have been great had they not been slightly stale and nuked to rewarm them. Some of their staff are great and others just going through the motions. Shout out to Hollywood for his attention. Plus it is dark and funky but if you want to read or use their wifi there is no place with enough light. I won't be going back.",

The cocktail menu had no standouts and really poor counter-only service (We were ignored so long that we contemplated leaving). They also have a speak easy upstairs, that we were told had a 25 minute wait and a two drink minimum, with \"high-end\" $20 drinks.  Yeah... I don't get it. There was a \"band\" tooling around on stage until 11PM, that was really a barefoot girl and her guitar singing songs she didn't rehearse on-stage, sometimes with a guy and sometimes just her.  Overall, it was a below average bar, but perhaps you'll have better luck trying it out for coffee during the day.",

Great lavender teas, and fantastic servers. They do have a small but well-executed selection of food, and yes they do have libations. I love that it's next door to a live band venue so that you can hear the musicians play at night. Good luck finding parking space here though, but the positive is it's very close to the light rail.",

    "text": "What a unique venue! I may have visited Amsterdam in the past which is what this coffee shop used to be, but regardless, the atmosphere is a trip! I love the steam punk-train station vibe going on here (as another reviewer described). I agree with that description!   I was hesitant to review because I didn't actually have coffee here. I had a Smoke and Cigars cocktail. Don't judge me since I had this on a Monday night but holidays are rough!! It kicked my butt! It was probably one of the strongest scotch drinks I've ever imbibed. I'm fairly certain if I had been fighting a cold the alcohol in it would've surely killed those germs. I'm thinking next time of sticking to an Old Fashioned, my usual.   Back to the atmosphere, there are 2 stories of areas to sit and enjoy coffee, or a cocktail in my case! There is a large outdoor area too so this place is great for large groups. I guess several literary groups meet here once a week or so!   Parking is on the north side but you have to come from south to get to the parking area and stay in the super left lane on the left side of the tram tracks to get there so it is slightly confusing, but at least the parking area is free once you do find it. One way streets make coming here a little more adventurous.",

Over the course of the past 2 weeks I've had to wait over 5 min or so for someone to take my order let alone acknowledge me. There's only really 2 people there that actually remember me which is sad. Seeing that their never really that busy when I'm there. So today as I sit in my normal spot without even have ordered. I watch from a distance as the only girl serving people is still engaged in a conversation that has lasted over 10 min. That's 15 min. That I a paying customer still hasn't been acknowledged. Not only is she not aware of her surroundings she's taken the liberty to use a cooler as a chair at the window bar. If I was the owner of this establishment I would fire her on that accord alone. I don't pay you to sit! Lol..it also seems like if I was to border alcohol I would get immediate service. Seeing that's the only clientele she's engaging with. So as I walk out now unserved to another business that's willing to except my hard earned cash. I challenge Charlie the owner to rectify the situation or I will assume that my business or anyone else that cares business is not needed for your establishment...it suxks because I really do like this place too..

It's a nice open environment. You could definitely make friends and meet new people or have a drink or something to eat. It's chill and I like the vibes here.",

They have a full service bar if that is what you are looking. There is seating for large groups, individuals, and couples. Upstairs and outside is slightly quieter if that is what you are looking for. Definitely come check out this place for great love music and chill DJ music as well depending on when you are here.

The coffee was PERFECT and the pastry selection made it very hard to choose only one (so I chose two, a slice of quiche and a zesty lemon vanilla cupcake!) There was a live music show in the ballroom and it was amazing. This is a must try venue. I was totally happy with this place and will definitely be back!",

Their brunch menu starts at 10am and you order food and drinks at the counter. There is no clear line and they probably need more people available to take orders. We got the breakfast sandwich and the BLAT sandwich, house fries, and a peanut butter cookie. I also had some cold brew coffee. The breakfast sandwich was Super yummy; seriously order it! The BLAT came out with out the fried egg, which is a critical part of the sandwich, but they were more than willing to fix it. House fries with aioli were very good. BLAT sandwich was disappointing. My peanut butter cookie was also disappointing: dry and a little overdone (brownish black on bottom). Customer service is friendly and accommodating, it just seems like they need to iron out a few kinks in how they do things in order to speed up service and make it more efficient. Atmosphere is great! Big open space, friendly people. Will be back!",

It's also a perfect spot to have some bites and be social. The drinks are reasonably priced as is the food. I highly recommend their \"Grand Burger\". The avacado fries are also good, however be prepared as they have a little heat to them.  The staff is extremely friendly and inviting. In particular the bartender, Zoey, was helpful in providing menu suggestions that matched my tastes.  She also makes a really great Moscow Mule.  If you're looking for a place that has a lot to offer The Grand exceeds that endeavor. Outdoor seating, indoor lounging, great coffee, full bar, delicious menu, chill vibe, awesome staff.

    "text": "My newest Downtown Phoenix love. From the outdoor patio to the beautiful interior to the diverse menu and coffee drinks, The Grand offers me everything I would want from a casual study/lunch/dinner/hangout spot. The menu might seem a little pricey for what The Grand offers, but let me assure you:  the portion sizes make it worth the $$. I ordered $3 french fries and felt like I had fries for days. Also the staff has been so good to me. I would continue coming back just to interact with the friendly baristas and wait staff.   What really makes The Grand my favorite place though is the upstairs study lounge. The tables are wonderfully equipped with plenty of outlets and desk lamps, comfortable seating and your food is delivered right to your work space. How can it get any better? Where there is reliable wifi, plenty of coffee, and the ease of ordering a full meal, that is definitely an ideal workspace for me. Did I mention The Grand is 24 hours? I really wouldn't mind pulling an all-nighter here.   Some downfalls would be the weekend brunch menu ~ that is all they will serve during the weekends, so don't expect to get your favorite sandwich and fries combo on a Sunday. Also parking can be a hassle, but they do have their own parking lot!! It just fills up fast if you come on a busy day, keep this in mind!!  Great place, great location. Way to win my heart, The Grand.",

    "text": "I'll start by saying I have always loved this building, am a huge supporter of local businesses, and rarely leave negative reviews unless something is totally over the top.  When we need a change of scenery from our office, we'll work from various coffee shops (Jobot, Lux & The Grand have been our top 3). It's typically 3-5 of us, and we spend $$$.  Well apparently The Grand is under new management (ownership?) and it sucks! After purchasing a coffee drink & donut for $9, I was greeted with new signs about \"laptop-free zones - please study upstairs\" and \"this table reserved for paying customers\" (duh) and new signs on the large COMMUNITY tables saying they're reserved for parties of 6 or more.   So we (begrudgingly) went to a table upstairs. Something is very obviously wrong with their HVAC unit/AC, as it sounded like we were working on a train, our table was literally shaking, and at one point it got so loud and clanky that I seriously thought something might explode or catch on fire, with debris and/or smoke coming out of the vent over us when it finally stopped.  So the 3 of us took our expensive coffee drinks and went downstairs, sitting at the large community table we often sat at pre unfriendly signs, and near a power source. At this point there were maybe 6 people tops hanging out downstairs, with numerous empty tables.  Then Mr. extremely rude, striped shirt Manager walks up to us and asks \"Are you expecting more people? Did you read the sign? These tables are reserved for parties of 6 or more people.\"  I told him we weren't moving because there weren't any parties of 6 to be seen anywhere, he should worry about his about to explode AC unit, that I think the signs and new community table rules are ridiculous, and that he should pass my thoughts on to the owner while I finished my $9 donut & coffee.  So dear owner, you are located a block away from an urban university campus. The area is also full of professionals such as myself who have plenty of expendable income, large networks, and may not want to \"study upstairs.\" This is both ridiculous and insulting when I'm buying your mediocre $5 coffee. This WAS a community and feeling like your new manager is babysitting me (as a 40 something woman business owner) is unacceptable.  We will be taking our business to the friendly establishments where we feel appreciated (or at minimum not harassed) moving forward.",

The vibe is cute and chill.

Uber or get a ride so you can enjoy drinks and not worry about parking and drink your drinks! We can back in the morning for breakfast/lunch and it was beautiful!

I've been to three other coffee shop/bars in town and this one might be my favorite so far. I loved the vintage decore, there was plenty of seating (inside and out), it has two stories and a nice craft beer list. Oh and a happy hour. My pint was only $5.   This might be a stretch but it's kinda like the Disneyland of coffee shops. Not so much as bright and colorful, but tons of cool things to lool at. So hopefully you're not easily distracted.",

I come here to study with a mocha and sometimes some food but whenever they jam the music like it's a clubhouse... at 8 in the morning, I can't get anything done. In conclusion, sometimes it's perfect, other times, it's a nightmare and The Grand has no intention of changing that.",

It was spicy and \"meaty.\" The blue cheese cut the spice well. I didn't feel like the cucumber went with the other flavors. I would have liked a side of fries, but wasn't offered any (only realizing it was an option after watching others get their food) and ended up going back up to order a huge $5 basket.  My friend got the avocado toast and a white chocolate mocha. She was a bit disappointed with the toast--the avocado was brown. The Grand seems like a good place to work and grab a light bite.",

The gentleman that took our order also is the one making the drinks, it took quite a bit waiting in line and waiting for our drink, but it's one guy handling it all so I understood.

They were more than willing to coordinate with me and having their help truly meant a lot to me.

Once classes were out for the summer I didn't come as regularly because I didn't need to study. Also, it's unbearable to be in The Grand during the summer because of the lack of air -- how can you not have a/c in Arizona?  I came in for the first time since summer last week and was met with a menu half the size, prices marked up a bit and no hummus platter. I LOVED the hummus platter and I would get it every time I came in because it was their ONLY vegan option. Their fries aren't even vegan.  I ordered the avocado toast ($8.50... come on) and asked for tomato instead of egg. I don't think they make their bread in house but they should stop ordering it. I couldn't finish the toast (sadly, since I paid too much for it) because it tasted rotten.  Now let's get to today. I ordered an Arnold Palmer with black tea. Repeated my order 3 times when asked what I ordered and still got the wrong drink. I won't even bother asking for a new drink since the girl taking my order was rude and short with me. I tried asking her if there were any vegan options and she just brushed me off saying some $10+ burger was the only thing. The lack of vegan options and customer services (+ no a/c) makes me never want to come back.",

The food here is pretty darned good, but almost every time I've ordered it takes almost an hour to get simple dishes, to the point where I rarely get food anymore. Every time I talk to regulars this is their #1 complaint, which is echoed by the other yelp reviews.   Definitely come here.",

Thinking it would be wonderful for my Niece Jasmine's baby shower, I tried to contact them by e mail for over 2 months before I went in person and talked to the ratty haired blond in charge of events. I wanted to have a Gold Coast Theme Gentlemen's area for the father and his party and then a separate area for the mother and hers reminiscent of the 1900s New York Society events. Well I was told NO and given the brush off like I wasn't even welcomed.  Well, I made other accommodations and as a result I would never recommend this place again. There are so many there alternatives that rude treatment like I experienced is never ok. The staff there was disgraceful! If I could give it less than one star I would.",

    "text": "Hey-o rebuttal review any one? This'll probably be one of my first \"serious reviews\" so I'm making it a plan to counter a bad review to compensate for lack of Jest. (Guess which one?) LET'S GO! Just left Grand. As always, the baristas are great, the service is prompt and the employees never hesitate to check on how things are going. Ordered myself the usual (never disappointing) iced chai along side (you guessed it) AVOCADO TOAST.  The zest to the avocado was tasty and felt like a real pallet cleanser. Couldn't find it in myself to complain about rising avocado prices, being as though that's an actual issue, especially for businesses like the grand. Everyone's gotta profit. I don't mind. I just want the cado. Didn't bring my kid (mostly because I'm 19 and don't own one) but even if I did own a child, I'd make it a point to teach it how to drink water without making a mess AMIRITE LADIES? Any-who, sat at the big round table upstairs. It's great for students like myself, equipped with charging ports for laptop and phone! It IS Pretty wobbly but I'm more of a problem solver and just pulled the ol \"righty tighty\" on it and adjusted the wobble. I'd like to point out that Grand does an amazing job of being versatile and diverse enough to serve all walks of life. They seem to be opening up a cool new portion downstairs for sorbet, have an upstairs for studying and the outside seating is amazing scene for a night at the bar. (Or I'd assume. What do I know? I'm 19) If diversity isn't enough to sway you on over, take note that Grand continues to be one of the largest/ more spacious coffee/bar joints I've been to in the metro area. That goes a long way with me. :) thanks Grand, for the kick ass service and the kick ass Cado.   Xoxo- Aysia (I miss us. Call me some time?)",

I was assured it would be okay, but it was served with bleu cheese dressing on a brioche bun, which I can't eat. I sent it back and got avocado toast with the egg removed. However, the bread had butter on it. I already felt like such an annoyance I just stopped eating (luckily didn't experience any health problems) and left. To top it off, the Bell's Two-Hearted IPA I ordered was sour and clearly something was up with it. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because others who don't have health restrictions might have an easier time.",

They have a reverse happy hour and a mini menu for late night sessions.  There is so much space around it's ridiculous and you can spread out as you need to.  They also have plenty of places to charge up, upstairs as well as down.  I have mostly come at night since my hours are off and the crew I've encountered have been super friendly and accommodating.  The only reason not for 5 stars is it can be sorry of dark in the joint.  I don't know how it looks during the day and they do have lamps but it does get a small feel of romantic setting.  Also they play music super loud all night.  That won't stop me from coming though, I can bring headphones to down out the sound and enjoy the space.",

The coffee, bar, and general store are excellent, staffed with lovely and friendly people that genuinely like working here! Always a good sign. For coffee, I've had a \"Butterscotch Latte\", and \"Lavender White Mocha\", and both were excellent! Breanne (bre-an) was the barista and she is very sweet and patient. I was told the baked goods come from a local bakery, Barb's Bakery. I'm always happy when local businesses support each other.  The general store is cool too. They told me the owner brings in really neat items, I for instance saw marble candle holders which were as grand as well, The Grand! haha and I snagged them! Excellently priced as well.   I've always loved The Grand for its atmosphere and drinks and especially its speakeasy \"Sanctum\" where you can enjoy The Grand's live music from above on Friday and Saturday nights. I only recently came back to try the food and it was not as great as its bar scene unfortunately. I had \"The Grand Burger\" but the bacon was not cooked all the way. I also had the \"Caramel Apple Waffle\" but it tasted cheap, I was hoping for a much richer batter like Matt's Big Breakfast's (across the street) Belgian Waffle.   All in all, I'll be back for the coffee, and drinks on the weekend, but I don't think I'll be eating the food anytime soon. Maybe I'll try something from the baked goods case near the baristas but probably won't venture beyond that.",

It has a hipster, steampunk, study/work area, coffee vibe. That is the only way I can explain it. It is 2 stories and is very open and spacious. They kept the chandeliers from the bar before it, which I love! The coffee and bar area are down in front as soon as you walk in. They then have a ton of different tables on the first floor with plenty of space to work or study; a small kitchen tucked into the back and a small area in the very back that has bottles of different drinks for sale. In the center is a staircase that leads to upstairs. This area is fun. There are a lot of different tables, couches, and chairs for you to relax and read, study or work. I really enjoyed the concept since it is right by ASU, so it gives students an air-conditioned place to study or work.  I had a business meeting here, and it was a great mix for everyone. They have a small menu of food, so we were able to snack, coffee of course for everyone and alcohol for after the meeting. We were here for about 3 hours, and it flew by. We had enough privacy to have our meeting and enough options to mingle, catch-up and get some work done. If I am down in the Phoenix area again or need to plan another meeting out there, I think this is now my go-to spot. Only downfall, small parking lot and you have to drive around the block to get to the parking area. Do not do what I did. It is a one-way street! (insert face into palm) I have had bad luck with that intersection haha! I wish I would have found this place sooner.",

I had the pleasure of meeting D'Andre who was the chef and made me feel like I was eating food he was passionate about, and no qualms about it he should be proud of his work.

Their draft beer selection is awesome (especially for IPA lovers) and the patio is so cozy and shaded and spacious. We had our 2 year old with us and the guy who rang up her creamsicle asked if he could make her a chocolate milk on the house.

There was no seasoning on the burger what so ever and the onion rings were not cooked all the way. I did like their coffee and pastries but I'm almost certain they buy them from an outside vendor. Such a bummer for such a cute place, they really need to step it up when it comes to the food if they're going to want to keep this place around. If I'm paying $15 for a burger, at the very least I expect it to have some seasoning on it.   Also, the two girls working the kitchen were rude and non-attentive to most guests I saw them interacting with.  Save your money and go to PHX Wilderness or Angels Trumpet Ale House, they for sure will not let you down.",

    "text": "The Grand deserves all the stars out there, because it is just what it's name says...it's pretty darn GRAND.  I am so thankful I was introduced to this place. A 24/7 coffeeshop/eatery/outdoor patio/study atmosphere/hangout/bar place! Seriously, what can get better than that?  Ambience-   Inside: I'm the type of person who likes a little background noise while studying so this place was my ideal arena. I came here on a Sunday afternoon for a good two hours, ordered a flat white and sat at a table and peacefully studied for the GRE. There's an upstairs with more privacy and enclosed areas with lighting and smaller tables for one person. The downstairs has larger tables for group hangouts/group study.   Outside: You can sit at the large wood bench-type seating at the outside patio that is SHADED and beautifully surrounded by plants and trees! I always love to see the anomaly of greenery in AZ (although I do love the desert vibes as well). There are also small tables and chairs to sit at outside.   Food/Drinks-  The food menu is diverse ranging from burgers, mac and cheese, salads, and soup. The coffee menu is pretty unique but at the same time standard with your cold brew, latte, etc.  Alcohol Bar: They have a decent sized bar right when you walk in and I noticed on the Sunday that I was there that couples and groups of friends came in to grab a drink at the bar and leave soon after to continue day-drinking. I mentally took a note of doing that with a group of girl-friends one day, too. Great idea! ALSO, their drink menu is super fun, they have strawberry basil margaritas!? say YUM.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND: I'm excited to go back to this place at night for a night-cap, but also to study some more and order food. I think this is the perfect place for people who are hiring to take their interviewees here if you are giving more of an informal interview. You can grab either/both coffee/food/drinks and sit down in a more private table upstairs or if you need a little bit of noise, sit downstairs!  Pics on Instagram: @deeps.eats",

    "text": "I stumbled across The Grand on my recent desert sojourn, and I am frankly shocked by the number of negative reviews on here. If I lived in Phoenix, I would patronize the The Grand daily.   The coffee is some of the best I have ever had; it evoked the memory of the high quality cafe con leche I used to get when I lived in Spain. To use an analogy, The Grand's coffee is to Starbucks coffee, as Starbucks coffee is to gas station coffee.   The food is good too. I had an opportunity to sample both the breakfast sandwich, with their house aioli, and the Grand's take on the BLT (the BLAST). I recommend both unequivocally.    Good coffee and good food make a good cafe. What makes The Grand great is its combination with beer. Such a place like this does not exist in the national capital region (if it did, I hope that I would've found it by now). The Grand actually has good craft beer (I'm specifically thinking of Wren House Brewing, which I was unable to find anywhere else while I was in the desert).   As for my fellow Yelpers' complaints about the internet, there did not appear to be any issues when I was there. Plenty of people were whittling the day away on their laptops.",

As always, I got my chai latte, here with almond milk and almond syrup. I enjoyed good flavor, just the right amount of foam and the perfect temperature. Weirdly, though, they gave me a disposable cup when I didn't order to go. Save a tree, Grand staff! This was so good I've already returned for it once. Staff are friendly in the mornings and the donuts are delicious, especially warmed up.  Outside of breakfast, my order of avocado toast was sadly disappointing. It felt like there was no seasoning at all. You can make an amazingly flavorful toast with just smashed avocado, a sliced boiled egg, and some greens, but you have to involve at least salt and pepper.  Finally went for a drink last night and I was disappointed again. It was still early on a Friday night and they weren't busy by any means. The cocktail menu looks great, but I spent $15 on a drink that mostly tasted like soda water. Looks like this place is relegated to being a breakfast stop only.",

I recently came back to your establishment within the last week, expecting the same freshness n brightness with the food, but to be honest, I was much less than impressed! Seemed like frozen vegetables left out to thaw and water logged. Same for the meat! I honestly felt embarrassed bragging to my friends and family in the area how amazing the food was at this restaurant for them to tell me, it seemed like fast food quality... not sure what changes you have made but please go back to ur summer time quality!",

I definitely recommend this place for meetings , studying time, or just catch up with a friend .   The location is pretty tricky to find.. the \"light rail\" separates the location, and \"the one way\" ,  tricks me into going to del Soto coffee shop down the street instead ...

Large tables, plenty of power outlets (and I mean plenty!), and too many nooks and crannies to hide yourself in to count.  The menu is fantastic any time of day. You can get a scotch & cigar and 4am in the morning -what a treat! I recommend trying the \"Mac of The Day,\" which is a different take on macaroni each day. (Some have included: pot pie macaroni, buffalo chicken, etc)  I really enjoy the bar options as well. Plenty on tap and specialty drinks. It's the only place I've been able to find a good lambic/sour beer (coming from Chicago where they are plentiful, I've been sad!)  Service is a little slow times, but that's to be expected with the large interest in this place.  Check out some of the pictures too. This place is BEAUTIFUL, both outdoors and inside. 10/10, if I had a coffee shop, this is exactly what it would be.",

When I arrived, I found it a little difficult to park because it's located on a one way street ...so for everyone trying to park, make sure that you go South one street to pierce and then turn into the small road to the left side of the light rail so that you can turn into their parking lot. The place has very cute decor, with clocks showing the time  in different parts of the world(you know, grand central themed). They have a loft area upstairs and ample seating downstairs (the perfect place to hang out and study or chat with friends). The staff were all friendly and helpful. They source their coffee from infusion coffee and tea in Tempe and get their chai from David Rio. Essentially the drinks here are like the drinks at infusion Coffee and Tea (aka delish), but far closer to my house (even better). They also have a full bar and many beer taps (a variety of local and nonlocal craft brews at a decent price point). Their happy hour right now is from 11 to 7...most excellent. I know I will be making many return trips to Grand Central and recommend you do the same!",

Was listed as having egg, white cheddar, aioli, chives, on a buttermilk bun. It came with regular cheddar and bacon. I told a barista I think I got the wrong sandwich, as it didn't list bacon and the sandwich I received didn't have chives or white cheddar. She had me go grab a menu and show her what was wrong. Umm, okay. So she offered to remake it. Round 2 all I got was eggs on a bun. No chives, no white cheddar, no aioli. I didn't have time to wait for them to screw up a third time, so I left. I'd understand if you messed up a complicated order with a lot of customizations, but how can you not handle the standard items on your menu?",

The decor is like a steampunk train station and the seating area is open and offers a few different levels along with a large outdoor patio.

And while its spacious, two-story layout is so expansive that it's underutilized, Grand Central is stylish, comfortable, and most importantly...  ...my new favorite day-drinking spot in the valley.  It feels like a bar more than a place to indulge in caffeine! Don't get me wrong, the coffee I've had has been decent. It's just that first you'll notice a giant chalkboard of rare drafts above a bar with plenty of seating--indoor when you want a quiet place to feel classy, and outside when you want to light up, bring your dog, or have a large, raucous group. A nice roast may be an afterthought.   As of right now, it may be a bit unfinished. There's not much of a menu (outside of the beer), and the patio could use a bit of upkeep. But it's such a vast and relaxing atmosphere I can't wait to come back.",

I ordered two Impossible Burgers; both topped with vegan cheese, one with sweet potato fries, and another with regular fries. I also ordered the Buffalo Bites. The Grand is not what I would consider \"vegan aware\". It seems they are getting aligned with the vegan trend and good on them! The food was well prepared and delicious. The fries were wonderfully long and cooked perfectly. I'm not quite certain the buns were not coated in butter to toast them. Ambiance is industrial dark. The counters are beaten copper topped, and tables of dark wood and a metal gear covered with glass. It seems to be used by the community as a quiet spot, with little nooks to sit, enjoy music, and work on one's computer. There's also a \"general store\". I will be going back for more vegan food and ask that its prepared all vegan. I give them 4 stars for being unique, going vegan, and having great chefs!",

Even in downtown most places are $6 and $7 already ticks me off, so $8 is outrageous. When 1 beer costs as much as lunch there is a problem. Sorry, but because of that I won't be returning.",

However, Grand Central offers a better experience in my opinion. Coffee shops can be cramped or crowded but this is not the case with this new gem. There is are upstairs/downstairs/patio areas and a decent sized bar.   The decor is modeled after (you guessed it) an old school train station. The owner has obviously dedicated a lot of time, money, and effort to convert this space. Stop by and check it for yourself.   Getting to it can be tricky since it is positioned on the west side of Central. Be sure to be in the furtherest left lane on Central to get to it or you'll be blocked by the lightrail.

Like a junkie, I tried to chase that first high by ordering the same: Kale Cauliflower Curry, and house fries.   The server brought both dishes at the same time. One glimpse at the lack of fries told me I would be left alone to sweat through my withdrawals.   The kale and cauliflower bowl held up, but I definitely tasted a downgrade. That's what made me look into the kitchen. Ohhh, different chef.   How dare he send out a dish of fries that was kids' portion. No, actually kid's portions are larger than what I got - it was more like a toddler's portion. The server hesitated to return the fries to the kitchen and I seriously thought he was going to justify the amount.   That's when I got a bit snippy and pushed to have them taken off the table. I could see feelings hurt behind his eyes so I assured my anger wasn't directed at him and he took the dish back.   More fries arrived a few minutes later, but it wasn't the delightfully seasoned heap that I received on the first visit. These lacked the seasoning and appeal. These fries were sad. Yes, SAD. That's what I told the server.   When I ate through a few on top, I found bits of something resembling fried meat (maybe bacon).   So to this cook, on that night -- in the annoying tone of D Trump -- \"You're Fired.\"",

The onion rings and fries are always a solid pick; large quantity and always tasty. Plus there is a 10% discount for students!  So why 2 stars?   I ordered the Caprese di Pollo sandwich and it was awful. The chicken was way over-cooked and tasted like a rock/complete rubber. The bread completely fell apart the minute I picked it up. The only taste was the overpowering amount of basil. It's pretty hard to butcher a sandwich but somehow the Grand did just that. Though I'll be back for the Grand due to their nice atmosphere and good snacks, I won't be ordering any main menu items like sandwiches or burgers.",

    "text": "So you don't have to be Einstein to figure out that you order food up at the bar\\counter,  they give you a number and bring it to your table. So don't go in and sit down then get mad when no one shows up to wait on you and smear them all over Yelp. Sheesh. Went in after 8 on a First Friday, they had what seemed a limited menu so I ordered a chicken Caprese sandwich. It was well built and tasty. Not excited that fries or a side are not included. I ordered the fries, and they weren't ideal. Soggy.  Love the decor and the large space, a variety of areas to sit to fit every mood: the bar, patio, sidewalk, quiet table, etc. I think that's what really makes the place, plus the fact it's open 24/7! Noticed the fryer really stinks up the place though, after sitting inside and eating, our clothes smelled like old fry oil.  Maybe we were just too close to the open kitchen this night. Don't worry, we'll be back to check it out again.",

    "text": "Great space and friendly staff.....no problem with the drinks (usually), but I never seem to have luck with any of the pastry they sell.......it always seems to be stale!!   They would be able to build a better business if they disposed or donated the pastry at the end of the day and start over with fresh pastry the next morning.  I think the cupcake I had today had to have been 3-4 days old.......dry and disgusting!",

    "text": "Really cool coffee shop and bar.  For those trying to describe the decor it's steampunk with a bit of Gothic thrown in.  Really interesting and we'll done.  Service was great and friendly.  Not too busy yet but hopefully that changes.  Definitely check it out for something a little more interesting.  The music is basically trip hop.  Low key and chilled out.",

    "text": "I just came here for the first time tonight with my friends from college and they've been here a few times before I have. I am a full time student and I also work 30 hours a week so today was the first time I was free to come and join them. I still had some of my subway sandwich so I started eating it while I was drinking my coffee. 3 of my friends were still ordering while I was at a table with my other friend that hasn't been here before yet wither. The chef (BALD GUY) came up to me and my friend and yelled, \"there is no outside food or drink allowed.\" I immediately apologized and said that I didn't know it wasn't allowed. Then he said, \"you guys were here last week.\" After that I got upset because of the way he was talking to me and my friend but also because he assumed I was here with them last week when it was only my first time here. He could've asked me nicely to put my food away but decided to be rude and abrupt to me. Very bad first impression and I am never coming here again. This place deserves no stars at all but I had to put one. Bad customer service.",
