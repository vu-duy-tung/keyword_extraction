    "text": "After reading a lot of the reviews, I can see why it was rated lower due to the \"wait.\" We went on a Wednesday night and were told we had a 20-minute wait and almost decided to find another restaurant.  We could see the restaurant was PACKED and decided to stay.  I'm very glad we did, because the food was very good.  They started with the salsa and tortilla chips- which was so FRESH, it was still warm and crispy.  I had the 3-tacos with different choice of meats, which were all very good.  Our server was very friendly, and offered suggestions on what to eat.  The only thing that I found may be an issue (but not enough to take away a 'star'), is the use of 'skulls' in the paintings and other decor of the restaurant, which may be a little scary for young children.",

Whether table or bar service, the wit is extremely long and the staff does not seem to have a sense of urgency to greet customers, take orders, refill water/ drinks, bring chips/salsa to tables. The staff is very friendly just too laid back in my opinion. This is an easy problem the owner can fix by stressing superb customer service to the staff.",

The street tacos were also way heavy on the onions (I know street tacos have raw onions; but they shouldn't be overpowering). The homemade corn tortillas fell apart they were so soggy. I'm talking so soggy you couldn't even pick them up. The fillings were good but had to eat them with a fork and spoon. Margaritas: decent. Three of us dined with one drink each, a shared appetizer (the guac) and had meager main courses (the street tacos) and the bill including tip was over 110.00. Kinda steep for a meal where tacos that are that pathetic.",

    "text": "I have been spoiled at the other location in Phx.  We had the conchita pibil I think is what they call it not sure but it was great there so we happened upon this place in Scottsdale and thought we would give it a try.    I got a chicken burrito that was ok but I would never get it again if I did happen to go back.  My husband got a 3 taco plate which was either $3.50 a taco or 10.00 for 3 and when it came out it was shockingly small next to my burrito that was just a regular size.  My husband says they were approximately 1-2 bite tacos and honestly that is not an exaggeration.  He finished his $10 tacos in 10 seconds flat still starving and asked to see the menu again.  He has never had to order another meal after eating a meal before just to satisfy his hunger.  This time we tried the appetizer I think it was carnitas that was soaked in coca cola or something.  It sounded good but it did not taste good.  The meat was extremely fatty and some pieces overcooked and tough even black.  I took 2 bites just to give it a fair shot but no just not good and he felt the same so the waiter was nice enough to take it off our bill.  The manager came over and we told her how we felt in the nicest way possible.  She thanked us for the feedback and then told us that she hoped we would try them again even after we said honestly after this experience we wouldnt be back.  Maybe we just made all the wrong choices.  Who knows?  I guess we won't find out.",

However, the other tacos did not fare so well. The carnitas and the carne asada were overcooked. The flavors were good, but the meat was dry.

Its a cute little Mexican Food place, gives off the normal ambiance, but what makes it a little cooler and catches your eye when your walking by, is their large patio area. They have a few outside tables along the side of their building and a larger covered area out back. Set up perfect for the weather we have been having lately. As soon as we stepped inside, everyone was very kind and helpful, this was our first visit, so they told us a little about the restaurant, the menu and their drinks.  We stopped by for just a small quick bite, so we order 3 small tacos, the carnitas, Al Pastor and the Carne Asada and oddly some mimosa's to go with them! Who said you can't have tacos and mimosas for brunch!?? LOL! Our waiter was very nice, informative, and attentive and actually made our morning better with how friendly and smiley he was. They always say if you smile at someone, it rubs off! It definitely did and he really helped make our morning! I feel awful for not remembering his name  The tacos were small which we knew going in, so if you are hungry I would order a few, but they were definitely delicious! The meat all tasted good, the onion and cilantro was all fresh, tortillas were fresh and warm! Great tacos!  Wonderful food, wonderful staff, cool place, had a great time!",

The guacamole is really the best in the area as far as I am concerned.   The house margarita was very good, made with fresh juices not bottled. If you are into Tequila the Queen does not disappoint, there is a large selection of fine spirits to taste.   The taco menu is the most interested assortment of tacos that you will find in any upscale Mexican restaurant in the country. Go ahead and try to beat this selection, WOW. Seriously? As a Chef I am thrilled to be able to get tacos here that are better than what I can make for myself. What a fun place.   The Conchinita Pibil is made in the traditional Yucatan style and is melt in your mouth delicious.   The Huevo con Chorizo made with Longanisa is outstanding and the egg was perfect as well as a nice surprise.   My friend loves the Salmon y Mango which is Smoked Salmon with diced Mango and Pico de Gallo   The Carne Asada and Chile Relleno Taco is a revelation. Wow.   We had the Tres Leches cake for desert with really good coffee. There are many other dishes that I want to try so I need to go back like, once a week.   Love this place. The outdoor patio was very nice, the evening weather was warm and there was live music. Our server was very nice.",

    "text": "Dined here when out of town since we were looking for a good Mexican place in a neat place to dine with our younger cousin. Barrio Queen it was!  Our dinner experience started out with us waiting a while for the waitress to come by. Long story short: good (albeit pricey) food, neat ambiance, AWFUL customer service. The latter is enough to make us never come back.  We ordered several entrees and one of almost every taco to share. Really good chips, salsa and guacamole. My favorite tacos were the nopales and rajas tacos - great for vegetarians and for gluten free people like myself. Their horchata was also really good - although $5 per glass is REALLY steep, even for Scottsdale standards.  After slow service but an otherwise pleasant meal, we gave our waitress our credit card to pay our check and that's when the %&*# hit the fan. We waited for over 20 minutes for them to come back with our credit card to no avail. It wasn't until we looked over and saw about 5 people with flash lights and knives in a commotion, including our waitress. When she saw us looking over, she finally came over and told us she lost our credit card since it had fallen and got knocked under a large generator behind a wall. Accidents happen, sure, and we would have been TOTALLY UNDERSTANDING  had she apologized and said they were trying to get it out, however the first thing that came out of her mouth was, \"so I'm sorry, I'm going to need another form of payment\" to which my husband responded he would like to pay with the credit card he gave her. She then became upset and said it was an accident, and got even more mad when we asked to speak with a manager. At this point we have been sitting there for over 30 minutes.  We were heading back home the next day and having to potentially cancel the credit card on which our rental car was on and flight would be a great inconvenience, and could not wrap our heads around how neither the manager nor the waitress thought this was a big deal or how they could not conceive why we were upset. They asked us to \"come back later\" as they continued to look for the card but asked that we put down another card for them to charge in case they did not get it out. In hindsight, we shouldnt have done this. After going down the street for some dessert they finally called us to come pick up our card. No apology again, no nothing.   With so many good Mexican places in Scottsdale, no need to visit this place that seems to completely disregard customer service. First and last visit here - which is a bummer considering their food was pretty good.",

Margaritas are good and some are great. If you can get the Barrio punch if your not into standard Margaritas. Extensive list of tequilas.   My two choices for tequila are Casa Noble anejo and Revolucion 100 proof. Bartender was cool both times.  Update after we finally eat there.  Once again, BACANORA!!!!",

    "text": "If you love authentic tacos, not just the ones from taco bell or filibertos, then you will love the taco menu at Barrio Queen. The taco menu consists of 20 different types of street tacos to choose from. And you can try one of each if that is what you wish, or order all of the same kind. It's up to you, which is what I love about it. One of my favorite flavors includes the Salmon y Mango taco, with chilled chunks of smoked salmon, diced mango and pico de gallo, served on a tiny corn tortilla. Delicious! I also tried the Carne Asada taco with fresh orange and garlic marinated grilled beef, topped with diced onion, cilantro and avocado., as well as the El Pastor taco with chile and spice marinated pork topped with diced onion, cilantro, pineapple, and salsa borracho.  Tacos is not all they serve either. Their menu includes enchiladas, tortas, burritos, quesedillas, and more. Barrio Queen serves up some authentic Mexican flavors while adding in their own rendition of spices and other ingredients to stand out from the crowd.  If you haven't tried this place yet, you need to. Excellent food! And don't forget to order their Barrio signature guacamole made table side - chunks of fresh avocado, pomegranate seeds, diced red onion, and maybe one other ingredient I can't remember. AWESOME!",

I asked if you had specials she said yes we have drink and food specials.... I asked if she could list the specials and she hung up in my face.... I have called back 4 times and the phone has picked up and then the call ends. I called from my friends phone with a different area code and the same girl picks up the phone no problem! We asked to speak to a manager 5 TIMES and she said it wasn't possible and that they were too busy... Finally we just hung up....  I had just convinced my friend to go to Barrio Queen over Loco Patron for Cinco De Mayo!!! I literally was telling him how awesome this place was and how great the food was and you display this kind of service?? Thanks Guys! By the way I posted this exact same post on your Facebook under your Cinco De Mayo pictures you were posting.... The ones that actually made me want to come and enjoy your establishment..... Customer Service is the BASIC skill of any hostess or employee that deals with consumers... Maybe it's time to have a talk with yours.",

Apparently my taco Tuesday special came with a very solid case of food poisoning! I am so totally disappointed, and I don't think the memory of this will have me back over there any time soon... I had the carne asada, pollo y chorizo, chorizo and the fish one (pesca-something) and one or some combination of them had my stomach in pieces an hour later, and with my head in the trash can by 4pm. Ugh, Barrio, why??? We were so good together",

    "text": "Very disappointed in our experience at this location. I have been to the Gilbert location once and it was okay. We were a larger party of 9 or 10 and called ahead but apparently they don't do reservations. So we arrived and waited about 45-50 minutes which was okay. While waiting we ordered drinks and some of us waters which we had a good experience with the bar staff and closed out with them as it is their policy. Once we got to our tables our waiter came around and asked for drink orders. Some of us ordered water and never received it. The waiter asked about ordering appetizers and we asked about the chips and salsa since in Gilbert they brought it to our table right away and the waiter told us they don't normally give us chips and salsa which was odd because every other table around us had chips on their table. The waiter then asked which one of us would foot the bill for the chips and salsa as if it was such an odd request.   Then when it came time to order the waiter was upset at one group who had moved over one seat for three members who had shown up a little late which we let him know that we can help with any confusion and he seemed to be upset. When it came time to order he was sneering at one guest who didn't quite know what they wanted to order as if we were wasting his time.   Once our food arrived I have to say I was really disappointed. The tacos were somewhat small and cold. My boyfriends burrito was good though.   The most frustrating part is not once during the hour we sat there did we ever get water. I had an empty glass and asked twice for water and nothing. We asked another employee who was cleaning tables who finally brought us waters. After speaking to a manager he mentioned that it is not their policy to give guests water which seems so odd for a restaurant. The waiter just ruined our experience with his attitude and put us all off of this restaurant. There are plenty of other Mexican restaurants that I will visit over this particular one again.",

I questioned the empty tables and her excuse was they were waiting for people to show up from their page. I asked how long do they give for a customer to show, she said 10 minutes. I said the tables have been empty for 40 minutes. She gave me a blank stare. I'm guessing they were short on servers, but she wasn't giving up that info.  Not returning!",

Also, there weren't enough avocados in it and they put pomegranate on top... unique but I wasn't a fan. Chips were also a bit stale. Still enjoyed my evening, but food was not quite as good as I remembered the first time.    Still loved the ambiance and unique taco menu with all the diffident options.

We planned to go to Frank & Lupe's but they were closed by the time we arrived in town (which turned out to be a blessing - see my review of Frank & Lupe's). On a tip from the hotel concierges, we went to dinner at Barrio Queen in Old Town Scottsdale and we ate a fabulous meal. The Margaritas were delicious. The Pozole Verde and Albondigas soups were to die for. Very fresh and flavorful. For the main course, we ordered a mix of tacos (the fish and carne asada tacos were the best), California enchiladas (which were fantastic) and slow roasted pork. Everything was great, our server was friendly and the service was great. The next time we are in town, we'll eat at Barrio Queen (and not at Frank & Lupe's).",

After being sat on the patio immediately we noticed shortly after, the patio began to fill up. It is a large restaurant so one would assume they would have a staff to match... WRONG! We were sat for 15 MINUETS before we were approached by our server. Our chips were stale, my sangria was WAY too sweet I couldn't even have more than 3 sips but the enchiladas I ordered were...ok. I probably won't be back. It really did seem like a cool place though... maybe just a bad night? Womp-womp!",

I had high hopes for Barrio Queen but must confess I was left less than satisfied.  I ordered the guacamole, the corn off the cob and the chili verde plate.  The guacamole was beautifully presented but the flavors were off--too acidic--and I was thrown off by the sweetness of the pomegranate.   The corn had promise but the texture and the color made me think it was frozen, which was really too bad since fresh corn is in season.   The chili verde was ok, but if you're looking for the traditional chili verde flavor, you might be disappointed.  All in all, it wasn't a bad meal it just didn't wow me.",

Two friends got a margarita and said they were good. I ordered the chile relleno with vegetables and a side of potatoes. I think the best way to describe it is that the flavors weren't melded together - the chile was full of vegetables, and it was really spicy, but it wasn't really a cohesive taste. It also lacked any cheese, which was pretty disappointing in a relleno. It was basically a bowl of intensely spicy (like four glasses of water spicy) chopped vegetables, kind of a ratatouille that I finished eating with the chips at the table. The potatoes were good at helping to cool down the spice. I don't mean to sound like a gringo with the spice, but it was really intense and unenjoyable.  Our service was okay - it was the beginning of a busy Friday night but our server wasn't very attentive, I had to ask for refills multiple times, he brought me the wrong side even though he helped me pick it out, he just didn't seem interested in helping us. After two \"meh\" visits, I'll look elsewhere for Mexican food in Old Town.",

    "text": "This is my second visit to Barrio Queen. This time for lunch. As in the first visit - I wasn't really impressed. (supposedly one of the top 25 Mexican restaurants in the country?) The tortilla chips seem to be hand made from their own, but for just dipping salsa the chips are too hard and thick. Also the salsa is colorful and looks great - it is actually quite bland in flavor.  Now on to the tacos. I ordered three.  1. cochinita pibil (house signature taco). The pork marinated in citrus was a good attempt - but there seemed to be a heavy cardamon or cinnamon spice lurking in the background of the marinade that dominated the flavors. I like the taste of slow roasted pork but the marinade killed it. 2. carne asada chorizo y queso.  Grilled steak was tasty but the Chorizo was burned. Last time I ate here same thing with the Chorizo? I am a chorizo fan and burning chorizo adds a bitter finish - like eating charcoal. 3. Camaron - I wouldn't know if the shrimp was any good since I was brought a fish taco (pesado) instead. I tasted Tilapia - not the fish I expect to be served in an upscale Mexican restaurant.   When I brought up the fact that I was served the wrong tacos to our server, her response was pretty much nil. The same as her tip.  Won't go back - I can pretty much guarantee third time would not be the charm. Also, I have had better, more authentic Mexican food all over the valley - I do not understand how Barrio Queen receives national recognition.",

Typically the deal is choose 3 tacos for $10; however since happy hour started at 2pm today, the happy hour deal included 2 for 1 pork tacos so I had 4 tacos today but they were mini sized.   House margaritas were included in the happy hour specials so my friend and I enjoyed our margaritas with are street tacos galore.   We also ordered tableside guacamole, which had a unique blend of jalenpenos, citrus, cilantro, lime, pomegranite, fig, and cotija cheese. However, this guacamole came out prepared and not made table side. We were confused by this since we saw a table close to us have their same table side guac actually made table side. We were disappointed by this.  Although our waitress was so friendly, we seldom saw her except when we first ordered and long after we had finished eating. I get that we were being lazy on a Friday enjoying margaritas and eating, but it would've been nice to see her a little more so we could at least get water refills. I had to ask one of the guys busing tables to get us water, but he only got one water for me and not for my friend. I just expected more for service when being on this side of town.   On a plus side, the small but delicious churro dessert was excellent as recommended. Only 2 churros on an appetizer sized plate with 1 half cut strawberry drizzled with a sweet sauce come with this dessert, but it was a way to get a sweet tooth fix without being overly indulgent.   My hubby and I got much better service with amazing food at their heart location Barrio Cafe, so I will most likely return there instead of here next time.",

Perfect potion and a flavor you haven't tasted at any Mexican restaurant.  The guacamole is made table side and has a sprinkle of pomegranate seeds. Absolutely appropriate and adds a crunch to the dish.   This is NOT your ordinary mexican restaurant. This is a a restaurant and a meal fit for a Queen... A Barrio Queen.",

While this was definitely the place, unfortunately, it wasn't the time and I stuck with just the one.  I like a good traditional margarita - tequila and lime on the rocks and nothing else, but the El Tamarindo on the menu talked me into upping my margarita game. Tequila, tamarind juice (I think), (fresh) lime juice and Tapatio hot sauce. The straw is coated in a tamarind paste. Lick the salt, bite the tamarind, drink the margarita - it's so good! Sweet, spicy and tangy all in one sip.  They've also got 400+ tequilas. GOOD LUCK!  Our service was super poor, but thanks to the other servers for picking up the slack of ours. She was super friendly! ...Just never around or available.",

The food (what I had) is not bad at all, but then it's not cheap. It certainly didn't blow my mind; nowhere close. I think this is just the place you go for a date or to drink alcohol and to see and be seen. If that's your priority, then you'll probably be plenty satisfied. Then again, that would make you a narcissistic bleach-blonde sock-puppet incapable of good taste.   I certainly got the feeling from the waitstaff that I was being ranked, and when the bill was not adding up quickly enough, their attention drifted away from me. I kinda hate that, especially since I worked in restaurants, and I know that tips are a self-fulfilling prophecy most of the time.   Anyway, not hitting them too hard, because everyone just managed to do what they had to within a slim margin of error. No real complaints.   Enjoy those margaritas, sock-puppets!",

    "text": "We're here to judge mostly on the food itself, so that's why I'm giving 3 stars (otherwise I might do 2). Overall, pretty much everything we ordered was on the level of pretty good to really good. I had the mole game hen - the mole was tasty (although I'm confused why they used such a small bird basically whole on a dish where the sauce is the main component - either break down the bird or use larger pieces of chicken. It's about the sauce!). We ordered a number of appetizers, tacos, entrees, etc, and pretty much everything was good. The one exception was the Tacos al Pastor, which were not good at all. Tacos al pastor is my barometer for mexican joints, and this one totally failed; it was drenched in hot sauce and the marinade for the overcooked pork was just not good. Oh and they used pineapple out of a can.  There were a number of stumbling blocks that unfortunately seem institutionalized and not just a one-night fluke kind of thing. For example, I tried to order the Cochinita Pibil - the very first thing on the menu and an item with a \"try this\" next to it - early on a Saturday night, and they were out. How are you out of one of your main dishes at the beginning of a Saturday night???   Now on to the real critique - margaritas and tequila. First of all, our waiter tried to talk us into a really expensive tequila to use in the margaritas. I get it, they want you to buy it, but come on, what's the point in really pushing us? We're not drinking it straight, the tequila doesn't have to be great.  But I could get over that if it weren't for the sheer lack of tequila overall that they use. Our waiter informed us that they use 5 shots of tequila (you only pay for four though!) in a pitcher of margaritas (6-7 glasses). That's right, for $32, you get 7 margaritas that have less than a shot of tequila each! Let's do the math: 5 / 7 = 0.71 shots per glass. 0.71 x 1.5 oz per shot x 40% alc = 0.43 oz pure alc per glass. 0.43 / 8 total oz = 5.4% alcohol! Let me repeat that, for $32 you get a pitcher of margaritas that has BARELY MORE ALCOHOL THAN BUDWEISER (5% ABV). A True margarita should have 12-20% alcohol. What the deal here?  Overall, the food is pretty decent, except the tacos. Just don't waste your time drinking.",

We were disappointed right away: the chips were thick, tough and tasteless. The salsa looked beautiful, but had almost no flavor. The guacamole was only fair (the avocado was mostly tasteless but we didn't downcheck them for that; avocados vary a lot). Everything looked fresh, but had little flavor. (How do you remove the flavor from cilantro and the heat from jalapenos?)  Normally I would go for the carnitas, but with pibil, al pastor and pollo mole on the menu, I was torn. I went for the mole even though I assumed that the butterflied chicken breast it was served on would likely be overcooked (it was); the mole itself was better than most, however. The beans and rice were decent, though under-seasoned and not as flavorful as we would have liked.   The carne asada enchiladas were only fair. The meat was chewy and lacking in flavor. It's served with beans (decent) and vegetables (which we tasted and left uneaten).  Service was unremarkable, probably because the kitchen was soooo slow (on a Sunday afternoon and not particularly busy). Sadly, we won't be back.",

We were then told by our server that they no longer offered anything on the drink menus. Why the tease?  Their taco menu, though extensive, was overwhelming and superfluous. Our table tried some of the more exotic tacos such as the cactus and some mushroom thing. Both were next to inedible. The mushroom taco in particular was one of the worst things I've ever put in my mouth. The chorizo taco was good, but not $2.75-for-two-bites-good. We tried some of the other menu items and the inadequacy in flavor was only compounded by their egregious pricing.  I would not consider coming back and would not recommend this place to anyone. Go to a real taqueria instead.",

First time was when they had just opened and will admit, it was a bit of a mess but the food was still tastey. The taco list was a bit overwhelming. But this time, my husband and I went on a Saturday afternoon and had a GREAT experience. In fact, because of my high alert due to the not so great reviews on Yelp, I paid special attention to those diners that were leaving (as we sat near the door).  I observed and overheard their attitude and comments to the host. I did not hear a single negative comment or see a single look of disappointment.  In fact, it was the opposite. Diners were expressing how delicious the food was with hearty \"thank you, we will return\", \"will you take our picture in front of your \"barrio queen\" painting?\" and my personal favorite \"can we speak to the manager to let him know how great our experience was...our server was awesome!\"  We ordered the Pollo y Chorizo Tacos to share and they were yums! I would probably order JUST these and a house margarita - which were also very tastey. In addition, we order the Elote (bowl of corn, cannot recall the exact menu item name) and the mexican style fries that are listed on the appetizer menu, again, sorry I cannot recall and cannot access the menu on their website to reference. Our server was attentive and knowledgable, the atmosphere less hectic than the first time around and the menu has been refined to be easier to read and not so over-the-top as far as choices and number of items.   This may quickly become our new place for street style tacos and margaritas. We have to check out Taco Tuesday for SURE very soon.  Run don't walk to Barrio Queen for a cool atmosphere, a refreshing margarita and some tastey Pollo y Chorizo Tacos!",

We started with an order of tableside guacamole for $12. We thought it was just average and there was no offer of the optional customization we have seen at similar restaurants (onion?, no onion? lots of jalapeno?, etc).  Tacos were on special so we had three each at $2.50 a pop. We mixed them up and sampled steak, shrimp, pork, chicken. Our clear favorite was the shrimp- seriously, they were magnificent. The others were just about average.  Our dinner ran around $39, which wasn't too bad. But honestly, I expected a little better quality.

The menu is online, expect typical pricing, but appreciate their generous pours.  The chips were fresh and salsa is mild.  I took pity on my friend and didn't request the habanero upgrade.  Takeout was our choice for dinner.  I was impressed with the bartenders' multitasking and laser focus to ensure every special request (extra dressing, etc) has been met.  The burritos are enormous!  The Barrio Pollo was exceptional, melt in your mouth heaven.  The chopped salad was also impressive!  This is a fun night out, great place to bring visitors, and is also in a beautiful area for an after dinner stroll!",

    "text": "So far my visits to Barrio Queen have been pretty darned good. This was my first time to the Scottsdale location. As with my time at Desert Ridge, we were able to grab a nice spot on the patio. While it wasn't overly chilly that evening, having the patio heaters on was nice. Service was quick; two of our party had already gotten their drinks when we arrived, so once we sat down drink orders it took no time at all to get ours.  Our server was pleasant and helpful in explaining on of the drinks.  I will say that while the house margarita is good, after having them several times now they don't necessarily stand out over and above other places and the serving is a bit small in my opinion. I may try other concoctions next time just to get a better feel. I mean, one needs to be thorough in exploring tasty drink items.......  The tacos I ordered were tasty and just hit the spot. The Camaron is becoming a favorite, with delicious grilled shrimp; as is the Barrio Pollo taco. T had the \"Death's Door\" margarita, which had quite a kick to it, spice wise (to briefly get back to the Margarita situation). Tasty and while a little strong, \"heat-wise\" for my liking, one I'd recommend you try.   Overall the setting of this Barrio Queen is great, located as it is in Downtown Scottsdale. The whole area is great for strolling, shopping and at this time of year soaking up the great Holiday lights and ambiance. An enjoyable time and recommended.",

He only made short comments on what we wanted, and if someone took to long (a child !) to say what they wanted to eat or drink he would just walk away to the next person and not come back until he was called.

I have actually made it myself multiple times but it's pretty hard to find pomegranate when its not in season. We ordered it out today for a change so we can eat it at home, and though I have always thought $14 for guac is a little pricey the amount has always satisfied and filled us up. Well the amount they give you for take home is insane, it is in a 1/2 lb container. I think it's an absolute RIP off and I will not return now due to that fact.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Barrio on a Saturday night based on our hotel recommendations. We arrived and was told the wait was an hour. No problem at all. We ended up waiting for 45 minutes which was great.   We were escorted to our seat and our waiter arrived. It started to go downhill from there. Our waiter was extremely dry and I take it he must have been overwhelmed.   We started with the table side guacamole at $14. At first I was like nope to $14 guacamole but then I saw the portions and we went with it. The guacamole was really good and it was topped with pomegranate. I thought it wasn't going to be good but I was pleasantly surprised. That's what earned them 2 stars.   We also ordered 2 house margaritas at $8 each. Once it arrived I took about 3 sips and it was gone. Definitely overpriced for the oz received.   By now our waiter hasn't come back and I have to flag him down for napkins and to let him know we are ready to order. I ordered the Queen Enchilada add shrimp and my husband had the Carne Asada Burrito. We also had the corn as well.   Before our meals arrived my husband ordered a sangria and more chips to finish the guacamole. Our meals arrived and my food was cold. Not luke-warm but cold. The cheese had settled and it just wasn't good. Not to mention the shrimp was put on top of the enchilada, the 5 shrimp I must say. Now my husbands meal was hot and very good. The waiter came back and I explained what happened. The manager came over and offered to remake my meal and put the shrimp inside. By now it's late and after eating off my husband's meal I'm not hungry. Plus my husband never received his sangria or our chips. My order came out and I took a couple of bites and was done.   I had high expectations for this place after reading the reviews and the recommendations but was disappointed during our stay in Scottsdale.",

I wish we'd saved our money. First of all, our waiter was indifferent at best. It took him at least 15 minutes to greet us and offer a drink. Once he took our orders, he went MIA, never checking back to see if we needed anything nor offering a second drink. We ordered 2 appetizers, the black bean dip and table side guacamole. Both were terrible. The bean dip seemed to be a bunch of beans floating in their juices served with burned tostado like crackers. Our waiter made our dip and it too was awful - somehow he made it runny, like with water and it was absolutely tasteless. For almost $15, I expect my guacamole to be tasty. Our entrees were good, but by then we just wanted to leave. A total disappointment of a meal.",

So last night we dropped $1300 at another place - so if I was the owner here I would be upset that my employees don't want to take business.

They were not flavorful, the cheese wasn't cheesy, the pork was not the typical carnita pork. We later had Mexican at our resort and it was exactly what we hoped Barrio Queen to be...",

Chicken Mole was not the best I've had but still very good.  Tacos?  Oh yeah...mix & match baby!  I got the second most expensive margarita and it was better than my wife's most expensive margarita...so I had two!  Outside seating was nice.  Be forewarned...NO RESERVATIONS.  We had no trouble getting a table for 4 though the place was plenty busy.  Solid 4 stars.",

I knew coming in that they only had black beans instead of Greasy refried beans and at the same time the enchiladas while tasty are not what I call the typical just cheese enchiladas with red sauce. I don't know, they have this other stuff on them. They also got bonus points because there was some kids selling candy in here and after we mentioned it to the waitress she must have told the manager who came over and apologized. Sitting on the patio was really neat. People walking by And just great to be here.",

    "text": "I've never walked out of a restaurant in my life...until I visited Barrio Queen. Saw the decent reviews on Yelp and thought I would ignore the strongly negative ones.  ...I was wrong. This was the worst customer service I have ever received. When we were seated, the table was not set. We poured over the menu and made some decisions, only to realize that no one had come by our table, whereas it seemed like the other tables were being served. We waited about 10-15 minutes, before another waiter came over and saw us and asked if we had been helped yet. He said he wasn't our server but he would find out what was going on and if he could get us some drinks. About 5-10 minutes later, someone came back with our chips and salsa and water. He never introduced himself as our server and just walked away, so we assumed that he was just someone helping out.   We waited another 5-10 minutes and no one came back.  Finally, I decided that I had had enough and got up and walked to the hostess stand to ask what was going on. They said they were short on servers. We said that we hadn't been helped and just would have liked to have an explanation as to what was going on instead of just being left to sit there. They could have even told us when we were seated. The person who apparently was our server came running in saying that he just delivered us our drinks and saying that everything was fine. They didn't try to fix anything besides offering us free nachos multiple times...so we decided to leave and had a great dinner at another nearby establishment where we were served right away.",

When I arrived it wasn't clear where to go to pick up my take out order, it is the bar.  But there is no designated spot.  I first had to stand in the area that was supposed to be kept clear for the wait staff, just to get the attention of the bartender.  He then passed me off to a colleague who printed my receipt, then walked around the counter to hand it to me to verify my order.  I also had to sign the receipt in the air, which was a balancing act.  The Nopalitos tacos were very plain and tiny.  The side veggies had too much liquid pooled at the bottom.  The ice cream had mostly melted by the time I got home, which is no fault of the restaurant, but it did taste off.  The churros were dry, slim and impossible to cut through with the plastic knife.  I liked the  filling.  The melted chocolate tasted funky.  Overall, I was disappointed by the food.",

The patio is comfy but nothing memorable.  Don't get me wrong...it's not bad.  But not 5 star worthy.  The service was great when we were there and it's always been great for me.  No complaints there.  I was joking that if you need to see the waitress for something, just drink all your water.  She was so efficient at filling water, I didn't remember seeing her most of the time. And I go through a lot of water.  Table side guac is the best.  Love the twist of the pomegranate arils. Other than that, it's basic but that's the best kind.  We also got nachos for an app.  Ok...don't expect a pile of goop all over your chips.  It was white cheese and I believe carnitas on top. May have been green chili on top?  Not exactly what most people think of as loaded nachos.  Fish tacos were just OK. A battered lump of fish.  Just not that interesting.  Three stars feels kinda like a slap after I say I love some things about Barrio Queen. I love old town in general I guess.  I'm trying to rate it as if it is not in old town.  I can't bring myself to give it 4 stars. It's not authentic Mexican food which is fine.  But it's just not memorable to me.",

    "text": "Opening day: as a reviewing patron, I always feel a bit guilty to fault a restaurant for poor service or inconsistent food on such a tough day. It's ballsy for the operators of Barrio Queen (motto-\"comida a toda madre\") to take on the day after Christmas to open at this Scottsdale Waterfront location, most recently home to the long-suffering Metro Brasserie. Given this brashness, I opted to proceed with drafting the following first impression.  As a trial run, my partner and I decided to just order three tacos apiece. There are over 50 combinations of taco filings to choose from, with some ingredients (e.g., barbacoa, lengua (beef tongue)) available only on weekends. All meats and tortilla are made in-house, according to our waiter--impressive.  I opted for al pastor, nopal y chile verde (cactus and pork), and champinon y huevo (mushroom and egg). The pastor was very tasty and tender, but the fresh pineapple chunks were a bit distracting: the fruit was definitely not roasted with the meat, as is typical for authentic pastor, and a little caramelization was all it needed. The cactus and veg were slightly pickled-tasting and delicious, though the chile verde a bit dry (my partner had a similar experience with his colorado). The mushrooms, sauteed with shallots and topped with a salt-and-pepper egg, were awesome. Despite the \"street taco\" sizing, I was satisfied with three as a heavy snack because the toppings were so generous. For this same reason, though, I gave up on trying to gingerly lift the dainty tortilla discs up to my mouth and pulled out the knife and fork.  As mentioned, first days are difficult, and to my chagrin, the tacos came out haphazardly over the course of about 35 minutes. After our meal, I had a hankering for something sweet, especially because the restaurant window and menu characterized BQ as part panaderia, I peeked in at the display counter next to the front door; alas, the shelves were mostly bare and looked more like a prep station than bakery display. Overall, I am excited by the storefront take-out window, though: it reminds me of the cafeterias you see in front of Cuban restaurants in Miami. Maybe it will be a go-to place for late night cafe con leche and croquetas. Here's to hoping.",

We asked Ron, the server, what he would get. He quickly told us about the Pollo a la Coco and the Chiles en Nogada.   The Chiles en nogada has apricots,pecans, golden raisins, onions, garlic, chicken, red wine all in a roasted poblano pepper. Served over a almond cream with a pomegranate garnish that will make you wanting more! The plate was small, but the flavors and richness made it special.   Pollo a la Coco was a Pan seared spice-rubbed chicken breast topped with goat and menonita cheese, saute of onion and roasted peppers all in a pinon cream sauce that is just good!   Next time we visit, I want the sample all the tacos or just a plate of the Chili Verde!  Will be back with our pup and sit on the patio for sure.",

And by terrible I mean YUCK, EWW, \"Are you serious?!?\" terrible. From start to finish, everything was bad.   We ordered an appetizer no onions...it came out seemingly floating in onions. Ok, no big deal, mistakes happen...Then we ordered 3 tacos each. So we're talking a 6-taco chance to pull together a decent taco...yet not a one passed. My mango in my salmon mango taco was literally green and hard (so under ripe I'm wondering how they even cut into it). The cactus in our cactus tacos was cold. The tortillas were also cold and couldn't possibly be any smaller. The fried fish taco tasted like lukewarm grease and frankly I can't recall the 3 remaining tacos we ordered because everything was so bland, meh, and unmemorable.   The only reason this places gets any stars is again the ambience. Who knows? It might be an ok place to go for drinks (I probably won't bother finding out)..just DON'T ORDER ANY FOOD!",

The salsa struck me as watery and odd. The tacos -- I got a variety -- were OK, but I definitely have had better (including at Blanco at Biltmore Fashion Park). I probably wouldn't return.",

    "text": "Upon a recommendation from our concierge, we went here for lunch on Cinco de Mayo.  They don't take reservations but we were able to get a table outside without waiting.  It was a hot day but there were misters helped a little. My dining companion and I shared an order of 3 enchiladas suizas, beans and rice.  The food was excellent. It's very different from your typical Mexican food but in a good way.  It was delicious.  The service, however, leaves A LOT to be desired. It was inexcusable.  Our server was too busy doing other things (non-server related) and totally ignored us.  We finally had to flag him down.  He never bothered to ask us what we wanted to drink, or bring us chips and salsa until we asked.  He didn't offer to refill our drinks, never checked to see if we enjoyed the food or wanted anything else.  To top it off he didn't return the credit card after we paid the bill.  I can admit that it could have been the cashier's fault but still he should have looked to see if he needed to return a credit card with the receipt.  Finally, on our way out we walked right past the server.  We said goodbye to him and he turned away from us and didn't say anything.  If you expect people to come back to your restaurant you should hire staff who will help ensure that happens.  A bad server ruins a great meal - and your reputation.",

    "text": "Lots of potential. A good location and a comfortable patio. The bar has very limited seating so the patio is the place to mingle. On the positive side, the menu is original and edgy. There is an amazing variety on both the food and drink menus to choose from. Portion sizes are small (think 3 bites per taco) so be adventurous & try several things you wouldn't normally order.  Service is the weak link here. Believe what you see in all the reviews - the wait staff & kitchen aren't ready for customers yet. I was there on a Monday afternoon at 3pm. Plenty of open seating on the taceria side and plenty of staff. Everyone was friendly and made me feel welcome .....but too many mistakes to overlook. Knowledge of the menu needs to go beyond pronunciation. I look for the servers to have tasted the menu & be able to give helpful insight. Not happening yet. No offer for water, simple margarita took several reminders & still came out after my second taco order. The marg still came out before silverware & a napkin which I requested 3 times.  On a positive note, the staff brought me an extra taco & later an extra margarita - explaining that both were over-runs that would go to waste. I think they just felt bad for dropping a few balls. I will definitely be back but i am going to give them some time to work the issues out. In the mean time, Canteen off Mill Ave in Tempe is a good alternative for a taco & tequila fix with good people watching.",

    "text": "As with many places in Scottsdale, especially in old town Scottsdale, which is very much a \"survival of the fittest\" sort of place for restaurants, there was at least one prior culinary resident of the location in which you will now find this establishment. It was a restaurant with a focus on New Orleans style cuisine and more on the higher end of fine dining while Barrio Queen definitely, while still having that sort of old town Scottsdale polish from being in an area filled with high incomes, it also has a more casual New Mexico/Arizona sort of feel that I think is a distinct positive. It also has quite a bit of outside seating which unfortunately was filled up when I went by with friends around 3 pm, and so we ended up being seated inside which, at the same time, gave me a chance to watch the operational capabilities of the servers and waitstaff.  First of all, and this may have been due to some sort of festival going on in old town Scottsdale, but the workforce seemed stretched a bit thin relative to the amount of customers. My table ordered drinks and app and then the drinks were finished and...no waiter....I finally got up (and this is why the inside table was good) and just ordered from the bartender directly to get a fresh set of drinks. So, don't know if this was a one time thing or or a more common experience for diners but something the management of Barrio Queen needs to watch. I will note that the bus staff was quite helpful and nice to see how they worked to sort of fill the gap, keep the table clean of used glasses and dishes, offered to bring fresh silverware, etc.  First off, the drinks, the regular margarita is okay and $3 a glass during happy hour and you can get Sangria (red and white) by he pitcher for about $20 and same for the margaritas. I wasn't overly impressed with the sangria roja and my friend had the suave made with jalapeno infused tequila and fresh fruit juices, not my thing but an experience. Overall all cocktails were between $8 and $12 which is a fairly reasonable price for this area.  As for the food, for the appetizers we had the choriqueso, which is sort of a Mexican cheese fondue with crumbled mexican sausage. The chips are not corn chips but fresh fried quartered slides of tortilla that stand up well to the melted cheese dip. We also had the guacamole, which tends to be of a melange of guacamole and red onion and about $6. I would raise the price a bit and provide more guacamole and honestly, wasn't too jazzed on the guacamole recipe and think they might want to check out the guacamole at Mucho Gusto in Tempe as a comparison, which stands out, for me, as a significantly better mix and also, the chips at Mucho Gusto, for whatever reason,  a lot better.  We did have the family style entree which is for two or more and comes with unlimited supply of epazote black beans (quite good, big thumbs up), mexican cole slaw (seems like it had lettuce and tomatoes in it, more like a soggy salad, not really my favorite but good for you), and the these small, fresh made, street taco size corn tortillas and wow, those are amazing....they are fresh made and taste like it and to me, that is a real stand out that you don't see at other places. Canteen on Mill, which mades great street tacos, doesn't have one's like these and the fresh made corn tortillas are worth a visit, I give big kuddos to Barrio Queen for offering this sort of fresh authentic fair.  Finally, for the entrees, we had the mole, which is shredded chicken in a mole sauce. My friend who loves mole sauce said it was good but overly oily, whatever that means, but I thought it was doesn't though I'm not a big lover of mole. We also had the barrio pollo, which comes in a cream sauce with green peppers, I thought that was good, though the chicken was in strips, not shredded, which would have been better. Finally, we had the cochinita pibil which is slow roasted pork with pico de gallo and pickled onions and it was fairly good.  So, back to the review, 3 starts because well, at this experience, the wait service just wasn't all that great and it may be my only experience since a restaurant I do love, the herb box, is within walking distance but I think that over time as long as management is self-reflective, this place may continue to improve. I'm looking at Alex F's review from 02/23 and see he went when they were not busy and the service was still not great. Well, if they don't get the service situation down, especially in the highly competitive market in which this place is located, in a year or two we might all be reviewing whatever new eating establishment has taken the place of this one, such is the life of restaurants in old town Scottsdale, and boy will I miss those little fresh made corn tortillas.",

We started out with the 'made in front of you' guacamole.  Very good and the pomegranate seeds made it.  The chips were very crunchy and made in half moon forms for scooping.  I had a beer and it was ice cold served in an ice cold mug.  We each had a variety of the taco options and all of them were good.  These tortillas were about the size of the cardboard coaster my beer was sitting on and were filled with great ingredients, served hot and full of flavor.  I would recommend lunch or dinner here any time.  Next time I will dive into a margarita or one of the 500+ tequila options available at the bar.",

Did he think she was interested in him or he would get lucky?  After waiting a long time just to get some water and chips, we ordered the overpriced guacamole which seems to be a favorite dish there. The waiter was disgusted that we wanted that. He tried convincing us to buy the nachos instead. He lowered his head, sighed and said he would make us guacamole. He had no desire to make it. Threw in minimal ingredients and served it to us without stirring ingredients together, the avocado was lumpy and there was no taste to it. After he stared at my wife's chest for a while, we ordered food and the house margaritas. Food was bland at best, no seasoning or correct spices, bitter. The margaritas were so strong it numbs you from the horrible food your eating.  Truly I think Taco Bell is a much classier place with better food than this dump. Do yourself a favor and go down the street to Diego's! Now that's a great Mexican  food restaurant.",

Its actually comforting, in my opinion, to go to a mexican restaurant and know that you are not going to be served these extreme portions nor leave stuffed and ready to explode.

I ordered 2 tacos. The waiter was nice and attentive enough. The guacamole with cranberry was delicious and I love their chips.  Well then the tacos arrived.  The tacos were SOO small (the rim of a drinking glass approx). They were served on a small appetizer plate with no side. We didn't expect it, especially for 350 each. You would think the waiter would give some guidance to inform new patrons of the size and/or recommend a side with the meal.  We were told after the fact \"they're street tacos\". The food was definitely tasty but underwhelming and we left hungry. I can go to several places for same taste, authenticity, same price and not feel hungry when I leave.  After the meal, the waiter brought the check, no flan, no birthday wishes, no mention to the fact of my request when we first arrived. Will I return? Nope.",

The menu said the guacamole was created table side, but the truth is that you have to order the large size or it just arrives already put together from the kitchen. It arrived with ridiculously large chunks of avocado which meant we either got a chunk of avocado on our chip or all of the other ingredients, but it was too difficult to get both combined on a chip. They charge for chips and they were very average - not worth paying for.  My chicken enchilada was tasty but arrived with some chunks of chicken parts I prefer not to see let alone put in my mouth. The serving staff is friendly, but our server was inattentive despite the fact the restaurant was fairly empty. I saw one of the staff act like he was going to kick a tray filled with glasses out of another server's hand - not very professional! I live in Scottsdale Old Town and love to find local places to dine, This might be fine for a tourist just passing through, but I will not be returning as there are too many other restaurants in town that deserve my support.",

What drew us in was the sign outside announcing their $3 tacos and $3 margaritas during happy hour.  This was a great find.  We had a few tacos, 2 of which were the happy hour special that day and one extra -- one was salmon & mango which my bf said was amazing, another had cactus in it, and mine was pulled pork if I remember correctly.  Both the food and margs were amazing.  The bartenders were extremely friendly, one even gave us a bunch of recommendations of bars to check out while we were in town.  The only reason it doesnt get 5 stars from me is because it closes so early.  It seems like so many restaurants in this area close by like 9 or 10pm, which is crazy to me because Im used to not even going out to dinner until 830 or 9pm.  Regardless, we're going to try and stop in again before we leave.",

With that said, the quality of the other dishes was sub-par.  The pork was so tough it was almost beef jerky like.  The chicken was dry and flavorless.  The Fish on the tacos was soggy and cold.  The server was so overly pushy with trying to get me to buy the most expensive tequila for a margarita that I just changed my drink order to water.  Overall, for the prices they charge one would expect well seasoned, properly cooked, and overall nicely plated food.  That's just not the case.  It's been bland, tough, cold, dry and disappointing every time I've tried it.  This place could do so much better and really be a great place to eat with a large group of friends or on a romantic date.  The kitchen doesn't seem to care and the wait staff just wants to up-sell and is not very knowledgeable with questions about the menu.  I gave Barrio Queen two chances, and will not give it a third.  I can not recommend Barrio Queen at all.",

Service was great too, especially since they treated our 21 month old son so well!!!",

The last time I was in this area was 2004 and it was certainly not this large. Fashion Square did not exist so my apologies if my directions are off a bit.  Anyway, this place was great!  Food was perfect size for lunch, I had 3 for $10 tacos which are street tacos with your choice of taco. There were about 15 choices to pick from. You can add rice and beans for about $3.00 extra, but I chose not to. Chips are homemade, and the salsa was great! LOVED the salsa! We had seats on the patio because it was a gorgeous day out. They had heaters out there too. Great spot and reasonable pricing.",

I guess you 'can' get chips if  you order the $10 table guacamole, but what if you don't like guacamole??  Maybe this place it just to 'trendy' for me...

The enchiladas with shredded chicken, another with mole, topped with fried eggs and sided with beans and potatoes.  Delish.  My partner (a serious mole fan) raved about the sauce.

We sat at the table facing the entrance with the Jose Cuervo mirrored sign, stylized hood cover from a car, and three tequila certificates.  The Don Julio print on the paper place maps seemed to indicate that there was some descent tequila served at Barrio Queen.  We enjoyed the simple three margarita with the Don that arrived in a plastic Pacifico pitcher.  My daughter had a cheese and mushroom quesadilla. Thick with cheese, mushrooms, and onions she got past the blueness of the blue corn tortilla and the onions, and consumed all of it.  The guacamole came chunky, spicy, and highly recommended by our waiter.  We polished it off quickly, still hungry.  Near our seats were black and white Barrio Queen shirts and food stuffs in cages.  The draft from the door was cold and unrelenting as patrons entered and exited.  Within site of our table was a Frida Khaloesque painting that had been Barrio Queened, a monitor with a slide show of employees, ingredients, and food, and a bar with pastries, caged liquor, and beers on tap and in a refrigerator.  The primary item, fifty of them, are fancy street tacos.  Each is a single, but everyone's order comes on their own plates.  I highly recommend the barrio pollo y chorizo.  The chorizo was really good.  The chorizo y al pastor was good and the cameron con coco was okay.  Four tacos and some of an appetizer seemed to be enough for a meal.  Adding some dessert was too much.  The churro was something to behold as it was topped with caramel and ice cream.",

Our server came to greet us pretty quickly but I take it that might have to do with the fact that we were one of three tables outside. In any case, he was very attentive throughout the hour or so we were there.  We ordered four drinks that were a little pricy but worth every cent. They were amazing! This was a few weeks ago so I can't quite remember exactly the names but they were delicious. Fresh ingredients and a good amount of booze.   The server made the guacamole table side and it was awesome. Figs, fresh avocado, apricot, chives, tomato among other ingredients made an awesome end result.   I give it a 4 star review because even though we didn't have a full meal, given what we did have when we were there, everything was great. I'll definitely have to give it another go around for dinner just to solidify the rating as I have a tendency to be very forgiving. :)",

I had originally been to the original barrio cafe located off near 16th street and Thomas and very much enjoyed the signature pork (piblis). Barrio queen however, provides for a much roomier ambiance with a relaxed feel. The guacamole they prepare in front of you is some of the best I've ever had (pomegranates included). The horchata at barrio cafe, best I've ever had. This time around I ordered the Arizona burrito, a green chili pork burrito. The tomatillo salsa verde on top of the burrito was sweet with a medium to mild heat, very excellent, and the pork was packed with a lot of flavor. The chili it was slow cooked in didn't pour out and wasn't too runny either, each bite with the salsa verde and the green pork chili was a perfect combination. Had I not been entirely too stuffed, the house French roast coffee with chocolate patron and white chocolate Liquor would have been a must",

The spot itself is perfect for lazy weekend outings on the patio or crowd around with the happiest people at the communal tables and bar. Staff is always personable and I often wonder if they are sipping from the wall stocked bottles of tequila. Hey why not?  I think my big appetite can never eat enough here. Have the guacamole table side. Ask for extra jalapeno if you want a kick with some more sprinkles of pomegranate to ease the hot level. I love it so much, I recreated this recipe at home. The tacos are served on really tiny tortillas and it never fails that make a hot mess on my plate. With their 3 tacos for $10, I highly suggest ordering a 6-pack which would barely put a dent in your flat abs. Trust me. I always go with the carne asada, al pastor, and the carne asada huevo. Who refuses egg on steak? Seriously. Here's an insider scoop, ask for their tequila passport if you sit at the bar. For every tequila you try, they let you collect stamps to ink your drinking adventure. Drink up, tequila is their happiness. I won't judge since I probably may be sitting right next to you with the biggest smile from ear to ear.  I will say I was surprised that for Taco Tuesday, they did not have a lot of specials that made it my go to spot for this weekly type of outing. I guess I expected them to entice me to stay longer, at least til closing time.",

There was something on the menu for everyone and the food was delicious and plentiful. Not to mention reasonably priced. Where else can you get 3 tacos for $10 in downtown Scottsdale?!  Several of us chose 3 different tacos off their long list of options, other chose one of the burritos or a salad. No one was disappointed. Don't forget to order the house specialty, guacamole made table side!   My only complaint was they seated us right by the front door and we all felt the summer heat without a breath of air. Watch where your seated and enjoy this jewel of Arizona.",

We got the table side guacamole, and for $10.75 it left a lot to be desired. She really didn't mash it up so it was extremely chunky and very hard to dip chips in - so we just mashed it up ourselves. It was also quite under seasoned, so it was more on the bland side.   As for the tacos, I got the al pastor (pork with pineapple), carne Asada chorizo azul (beef with chorizo & blue cheese crumbles) and the Pescado (beer battered fish). The Pescado was definitely my favorite - perfectly crispy fish and great flavor. The other tacos were great as well, but JEEZ they are small. I can't believe they charge that much for such a small taco!!   Nonetheless the food was pretty good for the most part, but I definitely wouldn't pay full price for those itty bitty tacos when there are a ton of other places you can go!",

He was pleasant and friendly, he checked on us regularly, he was knowledgeable about the menu, and he even gave us a 10% military discount when he noticed my husband was paying with a military credit card. The chips and salsa were a standout and the street tacos were all good. The beef and pork tacos were especially tasty.  The food we ordered was only slightly hot so we ordered some grilled jalapenos to spice it up a bit.  We were also impressed with the cleanliness of the entire restaurant, including the bathrooms.

    "text": "Cinco de Mayo a NoGo! Arrived at the restaurant just before 8 and parking was tough but we did find a spot after once around the block about 3 spots from the front door.  No wait to get seated but the seats given were far from great, half our meal had the booth next to us with their heads inches from our food and drinks (eww!) and the table didn't offer much room in the way of space for the appetizer, the salsa and chips and our drinks.  All had to be cleared away before our entres arrived.  The salsa isn't very fresh tasting, rather salty and watery at the same time.  Some bites had heat and others were lackluster... can't see how this is anything special that keeps patrons coming back.  The tortilla corn chips while likely made at the restaurant were boring and seem way too 'mass produced/uniform in shape'. We had plain or as the waitress called it 'traditional' iced tea as our drink order and the one refill while appreciated as it was long overdue (nearly impossible to see our waitress after she took our order, bus boy brought all our food) was now Mango in flavor.  The next refill was once again 'traditional'.  Consistency is a big issue for Barrio Queen when it comes to food. (see next paragraph). My order was the Enchilada, California with Shrimp.  6 shrimp added to the regular order was a good value at $1 a shrimp for 3 of them were plump and of good size, 2 were 'eh'/ ok and the last one half the size of the 3 good sized ones.  The 3 enchiladas filled with cheese were of a good flavor but also small in portion seeing as 1/4 of the entire plate was zuchinni and 1/4 black beans (which when plated were hidden under most of the zuchinni although they were of good flavor).  Presentation is sorely lacking and that's sad as we first eat with our eyes when dining out.   My companion had 5 of the various tacos and that was enough to fill his belly but also the choice of 4 on one plate and a 5th on another a bit confusing as if the reason was running out of room surely they might have chosen the one and only very wet taco to go on the plate by itself instead of bleeding out into the other 3 on the plate, many of which had good flavor but were quite 'dry'. Service was not impressive.  Seated quickly, drink order taken by Claire fairly promptly we watied for the actual iced tea, placed our appetizer order, when that arrived our entre order did not see our waitress again until time to place our dessert order (and she wasn't too enthused to offer it to us, did comment about not having fried icecream being the most common request and than no sopapillas either)and we watied almost 20 minutes for the churros even commnting aloud that maybe she went to Mexico to grow the cinnamon herself?  Most of the service was provided by the bus boy who I hope gets a portion of the gratuity as he alone earned it.  The quickest service from Claire was in getting the check when given our credit card.  Overall we aren't likely to return as there wasn't much special about our food or experience.  Certainly wasn't the festive occasion we were hoping for.",

It was really cool to see her bring up a cart full of guacamole ingredients and mash them together to make a nice, chunky guac.

We were halfway thru our dinner and the \"manager\" comes up to our table and asks us if we can move to a different table because he has a reservation for an 11 top coming in 30 minutes and he was wanting to use our table to push together with another table. I said well if you knew you had a reservation why would you sit us here at this table and allow us to order and start eating if you knew you needed the table for a reservation? He didnt say much else. He was not friendly and it put my friends and I in a very awkward position. On top of all that he didn't even offer to do anything for us because of the inconvenience he caused. My friends and I are all in the food and beverage industry and i would have never interrupted a table while eating and spending good money to tell them id like for them to move to convenience a reservation that i already knew was coming. If i absolutely had to do that i would certainly offer that table a round of drinks or something for the inconvenience and hassle. That was their mistake for not looking to see where they were going to put their reservations for the night. Our server Jessica was great though and we told her that the manager needs to learn better people skills and he shouldn't be managing a restaurant speaking to customers the way he did to us. Needless to say, we won't be back and won't recomend this place to anyone else.",

    "text": "This is my favorite place for tacos! I will admit I don't have as much experience with taco trucks or smaller home in the wall taco shops but those aside I think Barrio has the most delicious and diverse menu for tacos. The menu probably has over 20 + different choices and you can mix and match which I highly recommend to try a variety as so many are good in their own right. My favorites personally are the tacos with huevo (overeasy egg) on top, steak and pork tacos are amazing too. If you don't want a taco the burritos are as big as your head - and full of yummy ingredients. The fries are bad in my opinion but it's a Mexican place so what do you expect. I'm also very particular about margaritas and I've always had a great one here regardless of flavor. Another warning is the ceviche is boring and definitely not worth ordering. The salsa and table side guacamole are a must though! The chips are homemade- thick and crunchy. The decor is colorful and sometimes they have live music. It's a good place for groups or showing visitors a good time. It's not too casual and would be a fun first date location as well.",

    "text": "I will start this review off by noting that this review may not be the most accurate - please note I have not had real mexican food for about 2 years and my review may reflect this since I have been direly craving mexican during that period entirety.   We came here on a Saturday night around 9pm. The restaurant itself is dimly lit and was bustling with customers. There were a few tables at the bar and maybe 2-3 tables in the main restaurant area. The waitress seated our party of 3 right away in the bar area. The noise level is reasonable. Perhaps not the most quiet for a 1st date, but definitely good for a casual 3 date dinner. They have a full service bar and have comfortable seating. The decor is also extremely unique with green chairs and wall paintings.   The service itself was lacking. We waited about 20 minutes before anyone even took our drink order. Our server didn't even come out, it was a kind bartender who noticed that we hadn't been served and offered to take our drink orders and find our server. Following that the service was okay as the kind bartender offered to take us on.   We ordered the fresh guacamole as an appetizer, I ordered 5 tacos as my entree and we ordered the churro ice cream dessert. The guacamole was prepared table side and was delicious. It was a bit unusual as it had pomegranate and I was a bit skeptical, but it was very tasty and rather enjoyable. They also provided us fresh chips and salsa. The chips were a bit soggy, greasy and stale. However, the chipotle salsa was fresh and delicious. My tacos were amazing. I ordered a brisket, Cameron (shrimp), carne asada (steak), fish (not fried), and el pastor taco. All the tacos were well seasoned and the meats were well cooked. The fish and shrimp had a special sauce that well accompanied the seafood. Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the tacos. The dessert was disappointing. The churro did not taste authentic and the ice cream was a sad small scoop (though I took a good picture that made it look good). The cost of dinner was a little pricier, but not outrageous. Each taco was $3 and the guacamole was $12.   Overall, I would say the tacos were tasty and fantastic and the guacamole was unusual, but delicious. The ambiance is unique. The dessert was disappointing and I was rather disappointed in the service. The value itself was not bad for a sit down restaurant and may be a decent date location. I may come back, but Arizona does offer a number of other delicious Mexican options as well so I wouldn't go out of my way to do so at my next visit.",

I wanted tacos, was pushed to enchiladas with shrimp ($18), and a spicy Marg--a must have according to the waiter. I didn't even finish it.   Service was cold, unfriendly, and absolutely abysmal. It was so slow! Another service pet peeve, my food was presented at each table, \"is this yours\" style, before it got to me. I hate that!   So disappointing, I left frustrated and felt taken. Thankfully I found Diego pops which I honestly misjudged as a flash in the pan millennial Instagram place. Turns out, they back up their food with awesome service. Barrio, you could be awesome, please get it together.",

    "text": "The original Barrio Queen has always been our go to on Stetson in Scottsdale.  We always try to stop in when we are in town.  Our last trip we arrived just before noon and expected to have to sit outside or wait.  BQ Scottsdale has always been packed  at lunch during the week.  You could have shot a cannon through the restaurant and not hurt anyone.  We were quickly served and handed the menu and then the shock hit us.  The prices have not creeped up as one would expect but are off the charts.  The fresh table side guacamole is $15.00.  Avocados are expensive but they have not increased that much. We skipped that tradition.  The tacos have increased in price and 4-5 are now considered \"specialty\" tacos and hit you at close to $5 a pop. For newbies to BQ...these are 3\" diameter tacos with a tablespoon or so of meat.  My hubby had 3 non-specialty tacos and I had the short rib enchiladas.  The food is still good at BW Scottsdale!  I ordered a margarita and forgot they place it in a small \"rocks\" glass full of ice.  It is not in a typical margarita glass.  So the half cup or so of liquid is gone quickly.  Good margarita but...my bad as I forgot how small they were.  Get a beer!   Service was ok. Not spectacular.  Service was friendly and fantastic when we first discovered BW Scottsdale back in 2012-2013.    Sadly...we won't be back.  There are too many other great and reasonably priced restaurants in the area.  I am not sure why the menu prices have jumped so much compared to other restaurants we frequent in the same area.  My only thought is we are paying  for their expansion.  Two new locations opening besides Deer Valley and Gilbert.   So I give 4 stars for the great tasting foods.  3 stars for the service. 3 stars for the skimpy margarita. 2 stars for the increased prices.    Hint...craving fish tacos?  Try Coconuts!",

    "text": "It's just ok to meh.   This was a recommendation from the hotel staff...I'm not sure they understood what I was asking for because what I described is not what I received. I spent a good chunk of my life in Chicago and the Pilsen area had some of the best Mexican food (I am drooling thinking about it) ...your meal would always taste like if your grandmother was hispanic that she was in the back lovingly preparing your dinner for you (I am Asian ha)...this was NOT it.   There wasn't anything really horrible about this place but there wasn't really anything good.   I am very OK with paying a premium for great food...this place seemed to be a little overpriced for something you can get anywhere, there wasn't anything really miraculous about the taste or presentation.   A lot of people eat with their eyes first and my plate was messy and looked like leftovers from someone else's table. My meal smelled weird...similar to something to dirty socks (that is the best descriptor I can think of) ...and it tasted over cooked in some areas of my meal and undercooked in others...and it was way over sauced.   *I did love their chips and salsa those were great.   Our server wasn't nice but wasn't rude either...he had little to no personality. He was just there to get us our plates of food. I have had more personality from someone who was making my meal at Chipotle.   When you pay the prices they charge you expect a certain level of everything...service, atmosphere, and great tasting food...you may want to pass on this place if you are looking for the triple threat.",

    "text": "Barrio Queen was one of those places that I ended up dining at on the spur of the moment. Usually when I go out with friends or a group of co workers I like to do some research and plan it out but then again spontaneous visits are too also fun.   Originally the plan was was for my co workers and I to eat and drink at a rooftop venue that was within the same vicinity of Barrio Queen.  When we arrived there we were told that the food selection was limited and served more as a tapas style type of place. With the recommendation of Barrio Queen we all proceeded over to request our table of 12! The outside patio area is what caught our eye because the weather was beautiful and the scenery was great.   Once we were seated, our waiter came over to take drink orders and recommended some of the \"best seller\" margaritas.. in the meantime they brought us out some pretty stale chips with salsa and after bringing it the servers attention a fresh batch were brought out. As an appetizer we ordered a couple of Queso dips and fresh guacamole. Both were awful and it was really disappointing..   Once the drinks arrived umm I was a bit disappointed to say the least by my watered down margarita that he recommended and began to wonder who actually voted this drink as a \"best seller\" because I beg to differ.. I don't think anybody really liked their drink that night and we weren't trying to be a difficult group so we just didn't order another round. With seafood in mind I ordered one of the recommended Shrimp dishes and that actually turned out pretty good. Overall the experience didn't leave me with a feeling of ever really wanting to return.",

Gourmet salsa for your home made chips to start off, along with a guacamole recipe that puts all others to shame.  We had the carne asada for our main dish which was simply the best I've ever had!!  This was also the best margarita I've ever had since it was made with top shelf tequila and fresh lemon and Aquave juice (no sugary mixers!) - YUM!!  Special shout out to our server Jose who went above and beyond to ensure we had the very best experience!!  Thanks Jose!!",

The best part of the meal was the red menudo; I hadn't had a bowl for years and this was really great and spicy.  The tacos were itty bitty and a little dry, I would have liked some sort of sauces on them.  This place is overpriced in my opinion but I had a nice experience.  I would recommend coming here for drinks and apps only, you can find better entrees elsewhere.",

    "text": "OK I just HAVE to write a review for this one... because   IT WAS SUCH A LET DOWN!!!!  Wow, this place..... what can I even start with?  I have been wanting to try this place for a while. I then read a blurb in Martha Stewart Living (magazine) about it and said: ok, well I just have to try it out. We went around 6:30 on a Saturday night. What can I say about my fellow diners.... what a mixed bag. Some people in sneakers and shorts, others in what looks like prom dresses from Forever 21 with enough make up on, if it were to melt with the 100 degree heat outside-you would need floaties to float in it. Diners taking selfies and a million pix of their messy entrees to post on Facebook. So it's not really clear how to dress or what to expect.  Anyway, we arrived, had to wait, obviously, no reservations taken. The 2 hostesses were actually very friendly. A little tip would be that that front bar IS VERY WARM... the rest of the restaurant was cooler. We were directed to the back bar to have some drinks while we waited for a table. It was a nice solution. SO... The female bartender summed us up real quick, so we got the 'colder shoulder' treatment since it looked like we weren't going to order 10 shots of tequila. Really... after her taking our menu (we were the ONLY people at the bar at that point) while asking 'You don't need this anymore, do you?', there was no way I was going to order anything else from her. Come on people... is it that hard?  We were seated, we had a pleasant waitress. She had a few other tables, 2 that had either 6 or 8 ladies, so that means our 2 top wasn't going to get prompt attention. It is what it is. She was still nice, friendly.  We ordered tacos, and you know what, they were so VERY VERY average. Like REALLY just average. I think I might have had better tacos at EVERY OTHER PLACE I have ever had tacos in my life. I am not joking about this part. I even followed the waitresses recommendations and got 3 different ones, 2 being house specialities. My friend did likewise. She even left half a taco on her plate.  I am just wondering if there is another Barrio Queen people rave about, cause it can't be this place. CAN IT???? Despite the tired decor and so so service, and mixed bag clientele.. you think maybe the food can stand on its own. Well, it can't.",

I can't wait to go in for their Taco Tuesday to try more!",

    "text": "I have been to Barrio Queen once before and the last time, I ordered three tacos, all of which were very tasty and that had distinctive flavors  This time, I ordered a variety of tacos and was a bit disappointed.  All of the tacos are street style which means they are smaller than your typical taco.  Not necessarily a problem.    On this occasion, The first taco I ordered was the Suadero Azteca, which is a taco that has shredded beef.  The taco was very plain and the salsas did not add much to the flavor.  I then had the Al Pastor and the Carnitas, which were fine but did not really stand out to me.  The last taco was the Shrimp Taco.  When Barrio Queen says \"Shrimp Taco\", that literally means all you get is one shrimp.  I have had plenty of shrimp tacos in my life and this was ridiculous.  Who puts just one shrimp on a taco?  I motioned for the waiter to come over and asked him, \"Aren't there supposed to be more shrimp here?\"  He replied that they just put one \"large\" shrimp on the taco.    On the plus side, the waiter and everyone there was very friendly.   I may actually go back and order something else but my advice to anyone reading is to definitely pass on the shrimp taco.",

The bar tenders were friendly and efficient and we couldn't have asked for a more beautiful night to sit outside.  The food and drinks  were also delicious. We tried the house margaritas (lime and strong), guacamole (the pomegranate seeds were a perfect touch!), and a variety of tacos. We are only upset that we live out of state and can't come here weekly. Busy, fun atmosphere with yummy food. We will definitely be back if we are ever in the area again.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped by on a Taco Tuesday after work. We made it just in time for happy hour and decided to sit outside on the patio. (It had rained earlier that day so it was really nice out.) To start with, we ordered a half order of guacamole and two house margaritas. Since it was Taco Tuesday, all tacos were $2.50 (normally they are $3.50). There are tons of taco options and range from exotic to traditional. My husband ordered the crispy fish, Barrio Pollo, and Suadero Azteca whereas I ordered the Barrio Pollo and Chorizo, crispy shrimp, and carne asada.   Our guac and drinks arrived first. The guacamole was good (it had dried cranberries in it) but nothing to write home about. The house margaritas were really good - fresh lime really made all the taste difference. Almost as soon as we finished the guac, our tacos arrived. We dug in eagerly and were soon in taco heaven. Crispy fish taco was similar to other ones we've had, ditto on the shrimp. What really stood out were the Pollo tacos - regular and with chorizo. The chicken was marinated in a delicious sauce that was really addictive.   We overhead a waiter telling another couple that he eats the pollo tacos five days and week and if he left Barrio Queen on bad terms, he'd wear a disguise just so he could come back and eat the pollo tacos. My husband and I totally agreed - we agreed so much we ordered another round of pollo tacos (two apiece) to satisfy our addiction. During the second taco round, I ordered a Limon Y Coco margarita. (Coconut tequila with lime.) Oh my... this was the best margarita I've ever had. It was delicious. Even my husband agreed and tried to steal my drink. We both can't wait to come back for more pollo tacos and coconut margaritas. Watch out!",

Enjoyed the good-sized glass of white sangria throughout the meal.   We shared and enjoyed the table side guacamole that had pomegranate seeds! I've never had guac like that and it was delicious.  There could have been a little more for the price but it's still definitely a must order.   I had 3 tacos- Barrio Pollo, Pescado, and some carnitas thing that my server recommended. The carnitas was flavorful, tender and moist. The Pescado was really light and crisp.   We finished off by sharing churros.  Didn't expect it to be filled with caramel which was a yummy surprise but next time I need to stick to my guns and order the tres leche cake.  Favorite!!  Our server was attentive but not overly so, and was helpful with suggestions. Also, we're all obsessed with the decor.  I want their studded skull from the entrance in my house.",

We arrived and were surprised at how beautiful the place was, for some reason I had expected something less high end. Anyhow - being a warm night we sat outside to enjoy the ambiance.   The restaurant was quite busy - our server was a young lady who was quite curt. She lacked any warmth at all - she seemed as if everything was an inconvenience.  Traditionally, Mexican restaurants serve salsa and chips and it seemed to be the case here.  She asked if we wanted to start with Guacamole  - a house specialty, we didn't. Instead, we said, can we just have salsa and chips instead? She said, \" Yah, I'll bring you some\". but seemed genuinely irritated by it.  Bear in mind, this is after upselling us to 2 signature $15 margaritas  ( 30 USD) . Every time she walked away from the table we were like \" what is up with her?\"  I ordered a California burrito ( a vegetarian one) as did my hubby - and despite the amazing reviews online for the food they were decidedly average. I have definitely had better.  I came prepared to be wowed by the food, but the average food combined with the snarky server had us both wishing that we had gone elsewhere. I have had much better food at San Diego Taco Stands- with happier service too.",

The young man in the red t shirt at the entry told us it would be an hour and a half wait, even though there were many empty tables.  He had a haughty, arrogant attitude, as if he was doing us a big favor letting us wait for a table. When we asked about a seat in the bar, he sort of waived a hand and said that they have a bar and maybe we could find a seat.    When we were finally seated, the food was ordinary at best.  I also dislike the decor.  The Mexican \"day of the dead\" festival does not make for a pleasant dining experience.  Why do they not take reservations? The \"host\" was keeping the list on a small hand held computer.  Its the twenty first century people!   So, if you enjoy being treated with contempt, being kept waiting a very long time, and Looking at corpses and skeletons while dining on mediocre over priced food, this is the place for you.",

All of this would have been fine and I would have moved on with my night. But I am more sick than I have ever been after eating their food. Nothing tasted spoiled, but my stomach is not happy at all. Definitely would not recommend and if a friend wanted to meet here, I would request a different restaurant.",

We decided to try it again tonight and were sorry that we did.   Our chopped salads were literally LESS than HALF the portion size given in the Gilbert, AZ location and they very sloppily assembled. We also ordered carnita and chicken tacos, to-go, for our daughter. They put JUST meat on single corn tortillas and charged us $11 / 3 tacos.  Taking the time to drive down to the Gilbert location will result in a TOTALLY difference experience. Hope they see this and make improvements in Scottsdale. This is typically a GREAT experience everywhere else. We're rooting for you Scottsdale...!",

The service was friendly and attentive from start to finish which is always a plus when in Old Town!   When coming to Barrio Queen, ordering their guac is a MUST! They make it right there in front of you and the secret ingredient is pomegranate seeds! It is so tasty! Everything that they put in it is fresh and it shows. I also love their salsa that comes complimentary as you sit down. For lunch I ordered their Mexican Caesar Salad {it had a fancier name} with chicken and really enjoyed it. The dressing was delicious and had a great tang. The chicken was also seasoned to perfection. However, I found it a little weird that the bottom layer of the salad was a GIANT piece of lettuce. It was super hard to eat because you had to cut it up into smaller pieces. I would prefer the whole salad to be chopped up. The highlight of the lunch was their Paloma!! OH MY GOSH - it was made with fresh grapefruit juice and oh so tasty! I would absolutely order it time and time again.   Anywho, we had a great experience and due to the size and location, it makes a great place for groups!",

The queso is a preview of all of the pork and Chorizo tacos that they drain zero of the grease out of before serving. The 3 taco meal is a great option to try a little bit of everything, but be forewarned the grease in the beef a pork meals turn off the otherwise good flavor.",

They have fantastic drink and food specials for happy hour and I would highly recommend it if you are looking for a good spot in the Old Town area.  Our food was pretty standard Mexican fare but nothing to write home about. They do make the guacamole table side but do not ask you what you'd like in it which pretty much defeats the purpose of table side guacamole in my opinion. I also tried the roasted elote and camaron taco. The taco was good but the elote was a touchy too spicy for me, not something you usually get from elote!   The best part of Barrio Queen is the ambiance and the service. Both were spot on and made it a perfect place to relax for drinks and food. Just don't go here expecting gourmet Mexican fare.",

We would have spent a lot of money and have never been treated so bad. We would have walked and not paid after the way they treated us but would never leave the kind waiter holding the bill.

Another couple was sat next to them, they had their order and drinks brought right away. My in-laws still have not been greeted, then when they said something and they asked for a manager the hostess brought a waitress. The waitress had an attitude and said \"I guess I can help you, what do you want?\". When they tried to leave the manager came out and comped them their starter but sat them away from all other customers so they couldn't be heard if complaining.  This is outrageous! In 2015, in Arizona we have to worry about my daughter learning about racism at such a young age. A black man and white woman cannot be served like everyone else? I will never eat here and I hope no one else does either. An establishment like this should not be allowed to be in business.",

The Waitress was very nice, quick, and helpful. The food was nothing out of the ordinary, I had carne asada, I think the carne asada at the local drive in is better. I was a little let down. Except for the guac- the $10 guac is fantastic.",

    "text": "From our experience on July 5, 2014 I would say Barrio Queen is a good restaurant, and would recommend you try it.  We arrived just before 6 PM and were seated immediately.  We were brought their great chips, bean dip, and water right away.  Our server was right there with menus and asking for our drink orders.  The service continued to be perfect for the entire experience.  All three of us loved our dinners.  I had \"Chilies En Nogada\" ($24).  It was probably the best dish I've ever had at a Mexican restaurant.  This is one of their \"signature\" dishes.  Treat yourself.  You won't regret it.  My wife had Suizas Con Chorizo Enchiladas ($15.50) and it was very good too.  Our friend had the Arizona Burrito ($11), which she said was good too.  I had their Reina Sangria which was one of the better Sangrias I've had ($8).  The Dos XX Amber draft beer was only $3, which is a good price for a beer these days.  Overall we liked everything about the Barrio Queen, except maybe the Mexican music, and that ugly industrial concrete and bare pipe ceiling.   We would go back.  In our opinion the food is a cut above most Mexican restaurants.",

Which I find bizarre coming from someone in the service industry. The wait was longer than expected, which I understand but when we arrived back no apology for the wait. Once seated we noticed a big back bar that could of been perfect while we waited but we didn't know this being from out of town. I brought everything up, as I think I would want to know if something like this happens at my restaurant and the waiter offer our waters to go. At the same time he kept offering to buy the table next to us drinks if anything didn't turn out well. I will never come back to this place and don't recommend.",

Unless the expectations get crushed, then I just need to recalibrate.  Tuesday night in Scottsdale, and my hosts brought me here for a feed.  This is an extremely clean, decorative and exciting restaurant with a menu to match.  The table appetizer was a plate of nacho chips with a black bean dip, deep and rich in flavour.  We started with the guacamole, made tableside.  Big chunks of avocado with cilantro, jalapeno, lime, onion, tomato, this was not a green puree.  The unexpected was the dried cranberries added in for a tangy sweetness.  Sometimes they use pomegranate seeds-delicious!  For a main, I had the tacos, which was a tough decision since they are available in more than a dozen different variations.  I tried 4 different tacos as a sampler.  When they arrived, I thought they looked a bit small, sort of how a slider looks compared to a full burger.  But they filled me up just fine.  I could have ordered more at $3.50 a pop until I was as stuffed as I wanted to be.   But there was dessert.  I ordered the Choco Flan, a dense custard on top of a chocolate cake with Mexican chocolate drizzled over the top, and finished with crushed pecans.  This was an amazing dish!  A big win!  Now I need to lay down and rest...",

Made table side (not sure what's so awe-inspiring about that but okay). Our server topped it with craisens... Weird. Never had guacamole with craisens. Nor did I like it- who's idea was that?! I took them out. Flavor wise, it was a little bland (I guess that's why they add craisens???). But I love avocados so I ate it. Huge complaint about the chips. Get a different style. They were so hard and thick that it was not pleasant. :( again, I like avocado, so I ate it. I ordered their summer special salad which consisted of spinach, jicima, tomatoes, etc. Was pretty good. No complaints. Not like anything was wilted or soggy. Just a regular ol salad. My friends were all about taco Tuesday- with 3 street tacos at $10. Albeit for street tacos, it's a bit pricey. But we're in \"Snotsdale\" afterall. Why other reviewers scoff at the price when they know Scottsdale is over-priced in everything, beyond me. Go to Glendale if you want 3 for $6. They looked tasty and the consensus was that there were in fact, tasty.  Barrios fooled me though. I decided to order the \"Skinny Chola\" margarita. It tasted great, but I am convinced that it's \"skinny\" because it's half the size of a regular margarita yet the same price. Well played Barrio Queen... well played.  While it was decent, the only time I'll come back is if friends decide to come here.",

I requested that no one can eat the chips but the server said that's the only kind of chips they have.  Live Guacamole : for 11 bucks, Just one avocado worth of Guacamole. We already ordered live guacamole before chips and salsa arrived and have to eat Gauc without the chips as chips were super thick and hard to chew. Main course portion size is so small, my 3 year old ate the Adult serving and was still hungry. The sauce was so watery and was running in the plate.  Service was good and quick.  Will not go there again or recommend this place.",

    "text": "A friend and I went here last night (it was a Friday night). We arrived at 8:30pm and were told it was a 20 minute wait for a table. When we were finally seated (around 9pm) about half the restaurant was empty with multiple empty tables, which I thought was a bit strange seeing as they had not only us, but other people waiting.   We ordered the tableside guacamole which came with cranberries in it, and was lovely. I prefer the guacamole at The Mission though, because they ask you how spicy you like it and it is more tailored to your preferences, at Barrio Queen, they just put everything in and make it in front of you. We both ordered 3 tacos from the menu and the Paloma cocktail. The cocktail was nice, a little syrupy, and too sweet for my taste but overall not bad. The tacos were very small, but nice. I love spicy food, and so does my friend but we were floored on the carne asada y chile taco. I think it burnt about half my tastes buds out of my mouth and was quite unpleasant. The jalepeno in it had been roasted and none of the seeds had been taken out so it was like eating fire. As someone who never has problems with spicy food this was a massive surprise. The one taco that stood out the most and really impressed me was the chicken and chorizo barrio house special taco. It was truly incredible and given half the chance I would eat about 10.  The one thing that put me off the most, was the ambiance. While the location and decor was nice enough, and somewhat what you expect from a Mexican eatery in Arizona, for the price of the meal I thought the decor was a bit down market. This place lacks sophistication, which is reflected in the patrons who get very drunk and loud, while there are crying babies at the next table. So if thats the kind of mood your in, go for it. But the claims that this place is Mexican fine dining is False.",

We came here and made a reservation with a 35 minute wait for a party of 7 people. We were taken to a table within 10 minutes, our server was Kerby and he was phenomenal!   We were well taken care of with food orders and drinks never empty. I had made cupcakes as we were celebrating 2 birthdays that evening and they gladly stored them in the back refrigerator for us. Such a great experience for what we had been through. I highly recommend this place.  They have great chips and salsa, highly recommend the green chile enchiladas and their house margaritas are really good as well. Thank you again and we will be back for sure!",

We ran out of water on 3 occasions and our server was nowhere to be found. I requested sour cream to come with my meal and it didn't make it.  Our  server didn't manage to check on us until after we finished our entire meal. What did show up was a charge for sour cream on our bill that I didn't notice until after we had already paid.

The servers were definitely aware of the problem, with our server going as far as to crush one with his foot and say \"He's gone now\". Something about giant roaches and squashed bug bodies next to the table ruined our appetite. Really completely inexcusable and should be immediately addressed by the health department.",

    "text": "God bless Taco Tuesdays and the genius who invented the concept. I went on a Tuesday night for that very reason because it's hard to pass up a $2.50 taco.   Their taco menu is quite extensive so whether you love carnitas or fish or veggies, you will likely find something to tempt you. I tried the nopalitos and huitlacoche y champinon, which had mushroom and other veggies. They were pretty small tacos and I've had better nopales elsewhere but for $5 total, it's hard to complain! I particularly enjoyed the veggie taco as the earthiness of mushrooms always plays well with the queso fresco. My friend and I ordered the table side guacamole, which had pomegranate seeds throughout. The chips were pretty good- homemade, crunchy, and fresh- and they were generous on the avocado. Even with a margarita, the total bill was about $15. Not bad for a dinner out! Being from the taco capital of the US, I suppose I may be snobbier about my tacos. But hey, Barrio is a great deal with a good atmosphere and totally worth it for Taco Tuesday!",

We showed up and were told the wait would be 15 minutes and they were dead on, no complaints there. Once we sat down we had to chase down a waitress for our waitress after sitting for 15m and having no one acknowledge us at our table.   Once we got our service I found the food ehhh. Salsa was good but I've had waaaay better in Chicago. The Tacos came highly recommended, again, ehhhh. Frankly, this close to Mexico I expected way better.

He pointed out that Barrio is really similar to The Mission as far as quality and taste, but way more affordable and I totally agree!   I usually start with the house margarita, which is very good and reasonably priced for a cocktail.   Then, (even though we didn't get it this time), we usually get their Barrio Guacamole - it is SO good. They usually put pomegranate seeds, cilantro, cotija cheese (I think lol), and some other stuff in it that makes it amazing. If you don't get the guacamole, they do give you chips & salsa when you're looking at the menu, and they're amazing, too. The salsa isn't too spicy, and super tasty, and the chips are way better than the ones that come in a bag. You can tell they're actual corn tortillas that have been cut up and fried. We usually eat the whole bowl before our food even comes haha.  As for tacos, every time I come, I pretty much get the same three - Camaron Asado, Pescado, and Pescado Asado. The fish is always really fresh and I love the queso fresco and Barrio aioli they serve on top. I should probably try something different since it all looks so good, but I love fish tacos and they have some of the best. :)",

We had 3 different kinds. I had the vegetarian with the grilled cactus and one with grilled shrimp and the other with grilled chicken. I recommend the watermelon margarita to drink! The chips and salsa have a nice heat to it. Enjoy!",

Friday night is really busy for restaurant with 30-45 minute wait for any table in restaurant. The hostess is standing right outside the front door to take your name/number at which they will text you once your table is ready. Once we sat at our table the waiter brought chips and salsa(hot), the chips are fresh! I ordered Chicken Suzia without chorizo. I must say the jalapeno sauce on top of the enchiladas was AMAZING! My friend ordered the Chicken mole enchiladas and she raved about the mole sauce.  It's safe to say I will be back at Barrio Queen maybe for less crowded night.",

Although the servers are fantastic; the quality and freshness of their fish tacos have suffered.    I was at the Barrio Queen in Desert Ridge yesterday for lunch and the fish tacos at this beautiful location as well, were superb!  Everytime I eat at the Desert Ridge location, the service AND food are consistent.    With this said, Barrio Queen in Old Town, you've got to step up your game...I've already decided not to step into your restaurant again.  After a few visits and experiencing the same lack of freshness and quality, was enough to drive me away.  However, I DO appreciate the serving staff and the hostesses. Impeccable service and attentiveness to ones needs.  They should definitely be recognized!",

They have a specific food menu for HH (it's not something like \"1/2 off appetizers\" or something like that), and I actually liked it when restaurantes do that. There's about eight things to choose from and everything I've tried is delicious.   Last time I came with three people and only split two things (the taquitos & chicken quesadilla), and along w/the chips and salsa this was plenty of food. I REALLY like the chips & salsa at Barrio Queen. It's a chipotle type salsa & the chips are kind of thicker (and round). They're pretty filling, which is why we only ordered a couple apps. The quesadilla was pretty thick and filled with quite a bit of chicken & cheese and the taquitos were delicious.   Barrio Queen has good beer, wine & margarita deals during HH as well. The beer selection isn't real extensive, but does the trick.   I've only been to this location for HH, but I've had lunch at the one in Gilbert as well & can say that tacos at Barrio Queen are yummy (I'll save that for the Gilbert review though).",

I personally ordered the Barrio Pollo taco, Camaron taco, and the Camaron Asado taco - they were all very good. Definitely a \"three bite\" taco and not as fully loaded as other places in the valley. The Old Town Scottsdale location has tight seating quarters. Our server was excellent and the decor is so fun! I'd recommend this restaurant and would definitely eat there again.

We sat outside on a chilly evening but they had tons of space heaters so we were more than comfortable. We also had a fantastic waiter who was just all around pleasant and quick.   Our waiter recommended the El Don margarita since he said it was a popular option, so our entire group went with that. It was strong but delicious!   My sister's finance HIGHLY recommended the Chiles En Nogada and to be honest I may not have picked it off the description alone since I didn't know what to expect. It was absolutely amazing though. It was so incredibly different and the combination of chicken, apples, pears, dried apricots, golden raisins, walnuts, and onions served in a pepper and topped with almond slices, pomegranate and queso was just unbelievable. It was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. Even just writing about it right now makes me wish I had this dish in front of me at this moment.",

My Meghan L. is leaving us cacti-huggers for the land of cheese curds!  :(  So how was Barrio Queen?  Minus the fact that you're paying Scottsdale prices for tortillas the size of a tennis ball [what even...] and $10.75 guacamole consisting of one avocado, the food is pretty good!   I had the Chiles en Nogada which is a, \"Chicken breast, dried apricots, golden raisins, onions, garlic, and red wine in a roasted poblano pepper, served in almond cream sauce with pomegranate, queso fresco, and cilantro garnish.\"  It also came with a side of chipotle mashed potatoes and calabacitas.  I can't recall any pomegranate seeds in my dish but it wasn't missed.  I was too busy eating bite after bite of the best stuffed poblano pepper ever.  And that cream sauce!  I could barely resist the temptation of picking up my plate and licking every last drop of sauce.  The chipotle mash was also very savory and creamy with a nice hint of chipotle flavor.  Calabacitas is a vegetable side dish so yummers!  I also tried Mr. W.'s Cochinita Pibil.  Slow-cooked banana leaf pork marinated in sour orange and achiote paste?  Count me in!  The tortillas were so small though.  It was smaller than my palm, about the size of a tennis ball.  They give like a huge mountain of meat but three of the tiniest tortillas ever.  Mr. Dubs ended up eating his entree with chips like a pseudo nacho thing.    So while the ambiance and atmosphere in the restaurant is gorgeous [but man is dining al fresco craptacular when it's both hot AND humid] and the waiter is charismatic, I'm not sure I'll be back to this location.  I think their Gilbert location is calling my name!",

    "text": "After reading the reviews my friend and I decided to try this place while we were in town. There was a 20-25 minute wait, despite there being several open tables inside and out, but we figured we'd just walk around the neighborhood.  They texted us about 20 minutes later. We were initially seated outside but being that it was still 93 degrees at 9pm, we asked to be moved inside. I ordered 3 street tacos with a side of rice and beans. Clearly, I didn't read that the rice and beans were an extra $3 EACH. I've never in my life heard of paying $6 for a side of rice and beans.  My 3 street tacos were $10, teeny tiny and lacked flavor. The camaron asado taco only had one, yes 1, undercooked shrimp in it that I couldn't even eat. The al pastor taco, which is usually my favorite, was flavorless and the meat was unevenly cut. It remained on my small plate. The carne asada taco also lacked flavor and had more toppings than meat. My friend ordered the carne asada salad and left about 80% of it on the plate. You would have thought that would have been an indication to our waiter that it wasn't good. We were tired and not in the mood to complain.  He came back to check on us once before dropping off our check. I was shocked he didn't even ask if we wanted dessert. Being that everything else was subpar I'm sure we wouldn't have ordered anything anyway.  Needless to say, I was left thoroughly unimpressed especially after hearing how good the Mexican food was in the area. Besides the nice artwork and decor, this place left much to be desired. Don't waste your time or money.",

It was a busy Thursday night, but they still seated our table of 7 (we did not have a reservation) within 45 minutes.  I had the chile verde, which was absolutely fantastic. The rest of the party  had a variety of different tacos and said they were all great. The servers were great, they offered separate checks for our large party and were attentive throughout the meal.",

This is a hip restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating. We settled in at the bar and Giovanny was a watchful bartender.  He made me the perfect jalapeno margarita.  Not too spicy, but very tasty. The chips and salsa were brought quickly, and believe the reviews, the salsa is delicious. I ordered the enchilada suiza- such wonderful complex flavors. My dinner mate had the Cochinita pibil which he is still raving about. This place is as good as it gets.",

We saw an open bar in the back on a somewhat busy night where there was a 20 minute wait for 2 people. Relieved, we saw the bartender watching tv bored in the back bar and we promptly sat down....that's where it ended. He straight up disappeared. It was like he didn't want to work, and the second he saw us he went to the back. For what....no clue. After we waited 5 minutes- FIVE- for anyone to come out and even greet us, (no, we weren't even greeted) we said screw it and got up and left. I worked as a bartender all throughout college, and guess what, I'll pretty much never go back to this restaurant.",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Billy Ocean - Caribbean Queen)  She served me drinks during Happy Hour And all heads turned cause it was Patron In one bite of her dish I knew the rating and the name yeah Ah they said I was the Yelper they wanted to tame  Barrio Queen Now we're sharing the same drink And Bo Bites I'll rate them number one No more hunger on the run  Barrio Queen is located in the heart of Old Town Scottsdale.  I've heard many great things about their food and I was even here for the Yelp Elite event gathering.  Though I only reviewed the event itself; I had to come back to do my own review.  Needless to say, I was not disappointed. I came here after an art and wine gathering with some friends.  The wait for our seating wasn't too long and overall the place was popping!  On one side a full bar and the other another bar with dining area and patio.  The place we decorated with a Dia de Morte theme and old Mexican style setting.    I shot for the House Margarita to start as my mates order some appetizers -- Barrio Guacamole; which is made right at your table.  Fresh avocado and pomegranite to your thick and chunky style guacamole is definitely a treat and delight in my book!  I would recommend everyone to start with it!   I was debating on a street taco since I had it during the Yelp Elite party and found it pretty darn tasty and street indeed.  However, I shot for the Torta with their signature dish Cochinita Pibil; their award winning banana leaf wrapped and slow cooked pork with sour orange, pickled onions, and pico de gallo.  This torta had some pop!  Warning! The green chili atop is extremely butt kicking hot.  Taste at your own risk!  Overall I think you can put the pulled pork in a torta or a tortilla cause it would have worked.  It was that just darn good and delicious!    In the end, Barrio Queen was a hit and I would definitely welcome and recommend this gem anytime to anybody. - Enjoy!",

Our server recommended it and called it a life changer and damn it really was the best taco I have ever had.    Our server recommended it and called it a life changer and damn it really great!   The other tacos had interesting titles, but seemed bland & boring.....Ehhh?   That why this is a 4 star review.  Barrios also has 3 jars of tequila, mescal & jamaica which they keep displayed.  We tried the tequila and mescal and they were wonderful!  The Tequila & Mescal were unusual & good.  They liquors are hard liquor, so be ready for a strong drink which one should sip and savor.  NOT flavored but infused with the actual peppers.  The pepper Tequila was quite hot.  If you like spicy, this is perfect for sipping on a cold night.  It warms you from within.   I am no connoisseur.  I just like bold in your face flavors.  Barrios has bold flavors if you stick with these recommendations.",

Really tasty and a little bit of spice. did a variety of tacos. Their taco menu resembles a sushi menu in that there are probably like 20 or so and you check off how many you want. Pulled pork, the cameron or shrimp tacos in beer battered victoria were awesome. Even have a pork taco that has cactus grilled in it. Salsas were great.   tacos are nice size but not too big. Get a bunch of them and enjoy. They have all the mexican beers in bottles and draft plus looked like a ton of tequilas.  Quick Tip!!!!  If you go in during the busy winter season, if they say they are completely booked ask if you can grab a table that needs to be cleared before the next reservation. Quite a number of people arrived at 5:40pm for example and were told if you can be done by 7pm then you can have a table right now as opposed to waiting 2 hours.   Not sure why some people claim the service here is bad or give it poor reviews because servers suggest drinks or apps. Thats what they are supposed to do!.",

I had a hard time deciding what to get after that because everything looked good, but I went with a chicken quesadilla, which was good but I wasn't terribly fond of the chicken. My husband had their famous pork dish where you make your own pork tacos. He wasn't a fan of the chipotle mashed potatoes that came with it but I really liked them. I would sum up both the food and the decor this way: it's called \"Barrio\" for a reason - it has a local, authentic neighborhood feel. Everything is colorful and unique. I knocked off a star for the service. We came around 4:30pm, well before the dinner rush. It turns out that their service majorly lacks at this time of day - after we were seated it was several minutes before our drink order was asked, and we had to flag our waitress down to order after that. Also, we ordered the large size of guacamole, which on the menu is said to be \"made table-side\". Ours came pre-mixed with toppings already on it, so I just assumed that table-side service was not actually something that they did.  Well, turns out that once the restaurant became more full, they were mixing table-side guacamoles all over the place. I felt a little cheated out of the experience. This disappointed me but I would definitely come back here and try again.",

We then got escorted to our table and while walking through the restaurant we noticed cockroaches on the wall. Our group was a little uneasy about seeing these things run around and mentioned it to the waitress. Her response was that the door was open and there was nothing they could do about it! Sorry but I sit on a lot of patios in old town and other places don't have them running around and if they did it would be an issue they would address not just say sorry nothing we can do! She talked down to us at the table and said it was just something we had to deal with. After discussion we decided this was just infuriating and the manager came over to which we expressed our concerns. He apologized but still didn't seem too concerned with roaches in the restaurant. He offered us a gift card to come back and try it again which we will on a different day but it is disappointing we were told all this before and then it all actually happened.",

The tacos were good, although some might find them quite small, they were the perfect size for me. The homemade chips brought to the table were mostly good, but a few were still a bit soggy or greasy. The service was great, and they were very gracious when we asked to be moved inside as we were too cold on the patio. This.was our second weekday lunch here, and we'll definitely be back.",

No longer does your food swim in melted cheese.  We had the guacamole made tableside - a little cilantro and dried cranberries make it really special.  They make their own corn tortillas which make great chips.  We shared a plate of cheese enchiladas.  The side veggies were done perfectly - cooked but crisp.  the black beans had just enough sauce.  But the best was that enchilada sauce, which they also make themselves.  A smoky flavor - probably chipotle chilis? At any rate, loved the food.  Service was not fussy (Sunday noon in the summer) but good.  had  a nice glass of chilled white to go with our food.  We will definitely be back.",

We were immediately seated by our waitress, Ivette(sp), and were given a complimentary appetizer. The booth my wife, six children, and I sat in was perfect. I ordered the Barrio Pollo Burrito...OUTSTANDING! The quality of the chicken was superior. The horchata is the best I have ever had and the genuine service Ivette provided was top notch.

Our experience didn't start off so well, as we waited close to 10 minutes to be acknowledged by one of the bartenders who both seemed to be ignoring the 6 or 7 other people at the bar and were both working the well. After finally being greeted, we waited another 5 minutes for our drinks. 15 minutes for two beers is a little much!  However, things got better when we were seated. Our server was very friendly and knowledgable. We ordered the corn appetizer and table side guacamole. The guacamole was delicious, but I wouldn't order the corn again. To be fair, I was expecting it to be as good as a similar corn dish served at the Elote Cafe in Sedona, but it didn't come close. We ordered about 5-6 tacos from the taco menu which I would give an overall rating of a 7. The unusual ingredients and combinations were fun, but I thought the overall execution was just ok. I'll be back for the guacamole though.",

Nothing special there. Got 3 tacos. I the queens specialty,1 smoked salmon and 1 chicken. I took a small bit of each. The beef tasted odd. The Salmon was gross. Chicken one was terrible too. I ordered some pico de gallo and it tasted old. Mom had beef taco and it was unedible. We sent our food back and went next door to The Herb Box and had an excellent luch.

I have to say, that a power hungry, teenager with bad attitudes should not hold the power to seat paying customers. The barmaid was just as snarky and rushed us as we ordered, and then got our order wrong. When we asked her to correct the order, we got nothing but attitude. Also, I prefer not to be served by restaurant workers with sleeve tattoos--just a personal preference of mine. As for the food, I ordered a chicken burrito for $11 and I didn't recognize the meat insider, it may have been pork, or poorly flavored dark meet, chicken. Also, the server looked at us as if we had three heads when we asked for chips and salsa, as offered by every other Mexican Restaurant in the world! They don't offer chips and salsa, but force $12 appetizers on starving customers that just waited over 30 minutes in the 85 degree heat!",

She put all the ingredients in and stated mushing everything around with a spoon and served it to us with huge chunks of avocado still in there not mushed ! I proceeded to try to mush it myself as much as possible . Flavor of guacamole was mediocre . Way too much lime and just tasted bland. I should have just held off on ordering entrees at that point but we decided to order anyway. WRONG CHOICE! I ordered brisket burrito. Super salty and the meat had zero flavor . They drench it in sauce and it still doesn't mask that meat taste. My partner ordered the mole enchiladas and also were not good! The drinks were good and that's about it!

It seems like a good place from the way the restaurant looks, their menu, etc. but it's not really worth it. We were told we would have two waiters, and that didn't seem to work out well. One of them decided to point out to me that there was a fly in my food and flying around my face. THAT'S THEIR FLY. Flies in THEIR restaurant and the waiter has the nerve to point out to me that there's a fly on me. No apology. The tacos are TINY. You'd have to order AT LEAST 6 of them to feel full, and that would run you $20. The carne asada was tough and not very tasty. The brisket, however, was rather delicious, especially with the tomatillo salsa. Also the tamarind agua fresca was good, but it was $5. My girlfriend ordered the azteca enchilada, and everything on the plate was soggy. Soggy beans, soggy vegetables, soggy enchilada. I asked for a water towards the end of the meal and never received it. This place is nothing but a tourist trap. I could have had better tacos at Chipotle. Take your money elsewhere.",

We ordered drinks at the bar for what we thought would be a 20 minute wait, but we were seated quickly and carried our drinks to the table.  The staff picked right up and moved our group of 8 talkative people right into appetizers and then entrees.  They were patient, attentive, friendly and extremely helpful with the menu.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner the last night we were in Arizona. We were seated relatively quickly although the restaurant seemed very busy. We were seated outside, and although it was very cold, there were propane fueled torch heaters that made it feel like I was sitting next to a fireplace. Super toasty and warm! Our server was awesome! I asked him to turn on one of the torch heaters behind me since the other ones' warmth originally didn't reach me. Although I was the only one really seated in that area, he was glad to.   The salsa here is super fresh and flavorful. We cleared out the tortilla chip basket pretty fast. Salsa. Our waiter told us Guy Fieri dropped by for an episode of diners drive-ins and dives, and I didn't feel any of those vibes here, but maybe it was because I was sitting outside?  I tried the Pollo en Crema Verde at suggestion of our awesome waiter. The chicken was juicy and although I generally don't like Mexican food flavors and spices, I actually thought the cream sauce was very tasty and kept dunking my chicken in it. The highlight is definitely the chipotle mashed potatoes. I just want a bowl od that alone!   Entree portions are huge. If you're not that hungry, there's enough food to split!  tl;dr chipotle mashed potatoes are delicious, crema verde sauce is creamy goodness. sitting outside for dinner feels like eating next to a toasty warm fireplace thanks to the torch heaters. Service was very on point, helpful, and made good suggestions.",

I understand that they specialize in tequila (over 300) but only one bourbon was still a disappointment. That said,  the margaritas are just incredible- highly suggest that you try one. The guacamole is prepared table-side and is oozing with freshness. I had 5 of their tacos as an entree (pork, salmon, chicken, cactus, and one other ?)... they were very good. 5 tacos may sound gluttonous, but they each can be eaten in 2 bites. All of the food was very fresh and you got a sense that it was prepared with care. Overall my party of 7 had a great meal (dinner) while sitting outside on the patio. If definitely suggest that you try this place for a fun, relaxed dinner with a seriously stiff drink.",

If you order the tableside guacamole, the Mexican french fries, the street tacos, or the all-time favorite Arizona burrito, it is a five-star restaurant. They have the best Carne Asada tacos in Phoenix. If you order anything else, expected to be three stars.

    "text": "We had lunch yesterday, Christmas Eve, at Barrio Queen in Old Town Scottsdale. This was our 2nd time to eat there. To our surprise, it was very disappointing. For starters, the basket of tortilla chips placed on the table were thick and extra greasy. The accompanying salsa was really good, but the tortilla chips took the joy out of it for us, leaving a layer of shiny grease on our fingers that looked like we had been chomping on fried chicken legs.   My wife ordered veggie tacos for lunch. The plate came with three tacos, each beautiful but not much larger than a postage stamp. They were more like happy hour tacos, but about three times more expensive.   I ordered a veggie poblano pepper in a great sauce, but the dish arrived with a flattened, submerged poblano looking like a scrambled mess with no visual appeal. It tasted good but looked confused and unappealing. To make matters worse, this veggie dish was about the same price as the options with beef, pork, shrimp, or chicken.   So at the end, we wound up with a tab that seemed expensive considering what we were actually served. The service was just okay, not especially attentive or friendly.   There are numerous restaurants nearby that are commendable where we plan to return often. Sadly, this is not the case with Barrio Queen in Old Town.",

We got a couple drinks, a couple tacos, the green chili pork with chips, and the huitllacoche quesadilla. The tacos were tasty, but a little dry, and maybe not the most exciting tacos, but good. We were not fans of the quesadilla... not sure if that had to do with neither of us having had huitlacoche before, so I can't hold that against Barrio. The green chili pork made up for any other shortcomings.... this stuff was sooo delicious, savory, maybe slightly spicy, falling apart meat, cheese... it was great. It was even great the next day as leftover after sitting in my car for a couple hours... that's pretty impressive stuff. Prices at hh were reasonable. I'll be back!",

I parked myself at the bar and ordered a Victoria (which is my favorite Mexican beer) and some guac to start.  The avocado in my guac was not mashed but was actually chunks of sliced avocado. I don't know how I feel about that but that did not stop me from finishing it off with the awesome chips accompanying.  Their list of tacos is vast and pretty cool. They're $3.50 each or three for $10 (they're $2.50 on Taco Tuesday) I had the Carne Asada, Pescado and the Suardo Azteca. All three were delicious by the Suardo Azteca was my favorite with Carne Asada, Chorizo and Bleu Cheese. AMAZING!  There were so many more tacos on the list that I wanted to try but after these three and the guac I was full. The bar was full and the bartenders were very busy but friendly.   They also have burritos, enchiladas and tortas on the menu. So I have to come back and try other great looking stuff on the menu. But I definitely plan on being a regular on Taco Tuesdays.",

Barrio Queen was a pleasant surprise. This is definitely a higher end Mexican restaurant. It's not necessarily fancy but it's fancier then a divey Mexican food spot. You can get three tacos for around $10 and the tacos are delicious! They aren't your average tacos and there are about 12 different ones to choose from. The tacos are tiny but they are filling. We each had three tacos and then enjoyed the pork queso dip as an appetizer. We left just full enough without going into a food coma.    I really enjoyed the atmosphere. They have two bars, with the one in the back being much larger. There are several tvs in the bar to allow sports fans to watch a game. I noticed several specials for happy hour pricing. I love their drinks, especially the punch and a margarita called Limon y Coco which is a delicious coconut pineapple juice. It's truly like drinking a vacation and all I need to do is sit on the patio with one of the drinks in my hand and I might as well be in Cabo! The punch was incredible and definitely a must-order if you like girly drinks. The patio comfortable and feels like you're in a big city and the interior is comfortable as well.   This restaurant is definitely worth checking out to enjoy dinner and drinks. There's a reason it gets so crowded during the busy times of the year!",

    "text": "OK, let's start from the beginning. I claim to be a Mexican food expert, so it's hard to impress me, specially outside Mexico.   So I've been refusing to visit this place for ever since I'm tired of trying Mexican places that claim to be authentic and are just overpriced lame imitations.  But since today I was in a great mood and wanted to try something new (and had to eat in the Scottsdale area) I finally gave this place a try.   The service was super friendly, on top of their game and pretty knowledgeable. Five stars for the service!  The food was great in general, but let me go dish by dish.  1. Guacamole. Well, it's not authentic but it's tasteful. The cranberries or whatever they put are unnecessary and mine was on the spicy side, which I appreciated but not everybody likes it so be careful.   2. Chips. Super tasteful, thicker than normal.  3. Steak taco. Mmmm, nobody would miss it if you skip this taco.  4. Suadero. Not 100% authentic but pretty tasteful.  5. Al pastor. Nothing to do with the real thing. Can easily be skipped unless you don't care if it's a freestyle pork taco which tasted ok.  The tacos are medium-small.  6. Cochinita pibil. This was the highlight of the night. Pretty close to the real thing, great taste. Will go back for that for sure!  7. Shrip Barrio. Open quesadilla with shrimp. Tasteful and different.  8. Shrip with avocado. Meh.  9. Tres leches. Again, not authentic and barely OK.  10. Flan. Delicious.  11. Agua de horchata. The real deal. Super tasteful!  Bonus. I asked for a sample of the mole. It was well executed, thick, tasteful. A little in the bitter side, but again, mole can be cooked in thousands of ways. I definitely will try a mole dish soon.  Price was fair. Not cheap, not expensive.  Great decoration!  Cheers!",

I don't understand why they sell themselves and their guests short of a better meal by not using \"taco holders\" for lack of a better term. The tacos are served flat on the plate, and by the time they get to you they are soggy and fall apart as you try to pick them up. I ordered 4 Tacos and ate 3 with a fork and knife for this reason. However, this is my only gripe, and it's a shame since the tortillas are clearly home made. The content of said tacos was fantastic. The cochinita pibil was very authentic and juicy. The pork chile verde and nopalitos were very good as well. Overall I would be back.",

    "text": "We were really looking forward to trying this place! The outside seating area looked cute and the smells when you walked by were divine. Unfortunately, this place did not live up to our expectations.   Once we were seated, our waiter came and took our drink and food orders and said he would be back with waters. (In the 95 degree heat, we really were looking forward to that cold water!) About 15 minutes had past and we still had no drinks. Another server stopped by and asked if we had been taken care of. I told her yes but asked if she could bring us some water and check on the drinks. She came back quickly with water and said that our drinks would be up shortly. About 5 min later, she brought us our drinks from the bar. 2 minutes later, another waiter came and brought them again but took them back when he realized we already had them. Uhhh confusion much? No one stopped at our table again except to bring our food, which was like so-so. Nothing special. Our waiter passed the table about 5 times and not once asked \"how is your meal?\" or \"can I get you anything else?\". When we were handed the check (not by him), he stopped by to say sorry for the mix up with our food and drinks. Uhhh if he was hoping to regain the loss in a tip, that was too far gone. The other thing that reallllly bothered me was the fact that the hostess literally was watching our table the ENTIRE time we were there. She walked around and passed our table once every 2 minutes, at least. Non stop. And was taking notes on an iPad as she would glance over at us. It felt like they were waiting for us to go so they could seat someone else. It was awful and made us feel rushed.   Terrible service, awful hostesses and the food was eh...with so many other options, I wouldn't recommend this place.",

I'm happy to say that whatever they did to make changes now works. The menu is strategically different than The Barrio, and that works, too. My peach margarita was delicious, and my tacos al pastor were the best I have had. (I do understand that for some people, the portions may not be filling......so order a side dish or start with an appetizer.) No problemo.  Everyone at our table was very happy with their dinners and we are looking forward to sitting on their sidewalk/patio when the heat subsides. I'm also hoping they will have some of the same musicians that perform at the Barrio.",

    "text": "My 2 cents: WTF kind of mexican place does not serve salsa?    We met a group of 10 here for a bday dinner/ drinks patio thing on a Saturday night.  I was looking forward to trying it after looking at the menu online.  I first ordered a skinny marg and liked that just fine.  We had a few apps, guac that was nice but not better than Gallo Blanco or the Mission, and a few quesadillas.  When I flagged down our server to ask for salsa with our aracherra quesadilla, she looked apologetic as she explained that they do not serve salsa, just Tapatio in the bottle.  Excuse me?  It's like the chef's saying a big F You!, my food is so good it doesn't need salsa.  I can assure you though, it was definitely lacking some flavor that a well executed salsa or two could have provided.  I felt cheated.  I will go to a place based on their salsa appeal alone.  It's a crime akin to a sushi restaurant saying they do not serve soy sauce, it just doesn't make sense.    The service could have been a little better, but it was a Saturday night, and we were a big group keeping them busy with cocktail orders, so it was forgivable.  I did ask for the consolation prize Tapatio which never came.  Although I am admittedly salsa obsessed, even others in my party commented on how weird the salsa prohibition was.  Especially my friend who ordered the aracherra tacos, he thought they were dry and were definitely missing something in there.  Four tacos also came out on one plate, with no side plates, even though two different gentleman ordered them.  When we asked the food runner about it, he said everything was \"family style\".  You know how dudes are with their food, especially when you are sitting at opposing ends of the table and don't really know each other \"family style\" well.  I teased my friend seated next to me that I hoped other dude washed his hands before handling his tacos in the family style melee, but I digress.    The highlight of the experience was the Michelada I ordered with Modelo Especial which was made perfectly.  Probably one of the best I have ever had.  I ordered a second one, and this is definitely something I could envision myself coming back for, maybe during happy hour.  I know we didn't try any of the more complex dinner items, but really - I just can't get past the salsa ban so I doubt I will in the future.",

At the price point and with all the hype that Barrio Cafe gets, I was expecting more. We started with the Bloody Mary's - with no garnishes - as the the bartender told us he was out of them at the bar (but never went to the kitchen or asked other waitstaff for more. BTW - we were the only ones at the bar).   We moved from the bar outside to the patio where we ordered guacamole. It was basically 8 chips and two tablespoons of guac on a tiny salad plate - not sized to share for an appetizer in my opinion. The menu was extensive and taco \"sushi-style\" menu was cool but pricey. We went instead with the carnitas burrito. It was drier than expected and lacked flavor. It sure doesn't stand up to the carnitas burritos at America's Taco Shop or Gallo Blanco.   I hope this restaurant improves as it is a nice addition to the Scottsdale waterfront area. But we unfortunately won't be rushing back or recommending it.",

Service is the worst in town, employees have bad attitudes and don't care, always understaffed, didn't have small bills to give change from the register, dirty bar, dirty tables, undercooked cold chips, no attention from bartenders as drinks run out etc etc etc. I don't know what happened internally here but it's not the same as it once was. What was one of my favorite spots has become a sinking ship. Based on the information the employees readily complain about in front of their guests about management and staffing turn over I'll be surprised if this place makes it much longer. It's a sad thing.

    "text": "I visited Scottsdale for a week (never been to Arizona before).  I arrived on Sunday and stopped in Barrio Queen for lunch.  Service was very friendly and on point.  I was by myself and sat at a table.  My waitress took the time to actually talk to me even though she had many other tables she was waiting.  I ordered off the taco menu (very extensive with many different choices).  I liked that it was almost like ordering sushi where I had to mark what I wanted on a paper menu.  Food came quickly and service was with a smile.    I liked the place so much, that I returned later in the week (5 days later to be exact).  This time I came for dinner and sat at the bar since I was again eating alone and I hate taking up a table when there are bigger parties that could make better use of said table.  As I walked up to the front door, I was greeted by the hostest.  She quickly pointed out that she remembered me from earlier in the week.  I thought this was very impressive since I had only ever been there once and I'm sure she sees a ton of people coming and going while seating people.  As I said before I sat at the bar.  Bartender was very friendly.  He was talkative, but not overly like some bartenders tend to get...where it sometimes gets annoying.  He suggested a beer for me to try since I wasn't sure what I wanted to drink and I'm pretty open to trying new things.  He even took the time to give me the history of that very beer brand.  As I was looking over the menu, a waitress that was not even working my area stopped and looked over my shoulder as she was waiting for drinks from the bar.  She made a few suggestions for things I should try and pointed out what her favorites where.  I didn't even ask and here the staff was going out of their way to make my experience a  good one.  When you work in any industry, customer service is the KEY to success!!!  I did take her advice and ordered a chicken dish that she had suggested.  I REALLY loved it!!!  I will definitely recommend Barrio Queen to others visiting the area!!!",

    "text": "Thanks to Chow Bella, my friend Lori saw that this place was opening Monday and we decided to go that night to check it out. We planned on being there by 6, and I was a bit worried. Old Town. Day off for many. New place by Chef Esparza. Luckily, we got there just in the nick of time, as the place started to get pretty busy. Looking at the menu was a little overwhelming, as there are dozens of different tacos to choose from. Yes, there are other things on the menu, but the tacos are the selling points because of the variety. I brought the menu home with me just to write this review, because we sampled so much ! (It's ok, it's also a take-out place and you can take the menu. I am not a crook. HAHAHA!) We started with the elote, which you can get in a cup. It was delicious! We polished it off and ended up ordering another one later in the meal. The tacos we had? The flank steak with an egg (of course), barrio pollo y chorizo, carnitas, cochinita pibil, camaron, and camaron con coco. We also had the green chile tamale. Everything was tasty and wiped out in seconds! Here's where the final star for the review got taken away: Service. It started out great, but after the first half hour, it seemed as if we were forgotten. It was getting pretty busy, but with a chef who has so much experience, and a grand opening, the staff should have been better prepared. We had also ordered some things to go, and it took 45 minutes to get that. Luckily, the manger was really apologetic (and super cute!) so we didn't feel like total losers. It also would have been nice for Silvana to thank the people who came out. We saw her a few times showing people her other new place next door and even congratulated her, but we basically got a nod and that was it.",

We enjoy Barrio Cafe so have given this place three chances and each has been worse than the prior visit. In our latest trip we had three servers each of whom seemed confused and untrained. The first person shows up and asks if we have questions about the menu and then -- when we ask a few -- tells us he cannot answer them because he is new and needs to get someone else. The next server then takes our order and proceeds to be oblivious as our entrees show up (about an hour after order) ten minutes before the guacamole and chips appetizer shows up. He was not aware of this though as he was apparently too busy standing around ignoring the few tables he was tending. He then disappears and we get a third server who insists he take our plates when we are still eating multiple times until we have to tell him to go away. The staff seems untrained and not to care at all.   As to the food it is by no means bad but far from what you expect from Barrio Cafe's management team. The tacos (we ordered several flank steak and vegetarian ones)   are tiny, tasteless and overpriced. The guacamole appetizer was a small portion of avocado overloaded with salt and with a handful of (overly fried) hard as a rock chips. The chicken mole burrito was OK. The best item was the kids steak and corn dishes.  Go to Barrio Cafe, or anywhere else, and ignore this place.",

First of all the location is great, if you don't drive like me the bus will drop you off about 5 minutes away or its just a short bicycle ride from downtown Tempe. Couple of drawbacks but I know this is because they just opened. They didn't have a Tequila list so I had to rely on the waitress to pick something for me. It worked out great because it was delicious. The second is that the portions are a little small but the prices are more than affordable so I can fill up on other things that are on the menu. I started with the vasito. Delicious and tangy! I had two tacos, one was the barrio pollo and the cochinita pibil. Both were very spicy. I like this but others may not. Both were beyond perfection for me. My boyfriend ordered the huitlacoche quesadilla, the \"Mexican truffle\" and the al pastor taco. The 'dilla had just the right amount of wonderful cheese. I ended with the flan. It was very tiny and not enough for two people so you might want to get more than one if you're planning on sharing. I left very satisfied and extremely happy that I finally found a restaurant that can satisfy my craving for delicious, affordable Mexican food.",

    "text": "I knew that going to a new restaurant on opening day would have some hiccups in service and possibly food preparation. That said we decided to try Barrio Queen for lunch today. The idea of ordering at the window and having a seat outside was a nice idea for a lunch on a sunny afternoon While ordering it was evident that the woman taking our order was very unfamiliar with the extensive menu.  No problem! We persevered and slowly went through the menu items and got the order placed. The server was very friendly and apologetic for the time it took. this was not a big deal.  It was time to pay and off to our table we went to await the fantastic sounding food we ordered.  W ordered 4 tacos 1 salmon y Mango, 1 Chorizo, 1 Barrio Pollo and 1 arrachera y relleno.  We also ordered what we believed what we believed would be the star of the day, The masa azul quesadilla with Huitlacoche \" the mexican truffle\" .  The 4 tacos arrived and where each truly unique and different. I also didn't get the same plate representation that DAVID L. posted and didn't get side dishes of sauces. (I know HICCUPS) While they were delicious the arrachera y relleno seemed to have lost its relleno.  Oh well opening day hiccups, not something to worry about as it was still very good.  Then came the Huitlacoche quesadilla. We have had huitlacoche a few times and really like its flavor.  The menu describes the quesadilla as served with quesillo cheese, sauteed onions, roasted pepper mix and of course huitlacoche.  When it arrived at our table the server identified it as a quesadilla champinon.  We asked her about the huitloche and she corrected herself and said thats what we had and she misspoke. Upon examination what we had was a quesadilla containing cheese, sauteed onions and button mushrooms. No sign of the pepper mix or the Huitlacoche.   My husband returned it to the window and the woman was very sorry and said she would get us what we ordered.  She took the quesadilla.  A few minutes later she came to the table and said what we had was huitlache.  When we disagreed she offered to get the manager.   The manager came to our table and he told us what we had was huitlacoche.  My husband told him we knew what huitlacoche was and that it was grown on corn and was a purplish black color and that our quesadilla was only onions, mushrooms and cheese. No huitlacoche or anything that resembled it.  His only reply was that is what huitlacoche is.   He then said he wouldn't charge us for it.  Nice since we had already paid! he then said he would get it taken care of.  We finished our margaritas and left never seeing him, our $8.00 or our incorrect quesadilla again.   Based on the quality and taste of the tacos I would be glad to recommend this place, however after the conversation with the manager I can not return.  He was confrontational and actually insisted we had something that we clearly did not and implied we just didn't know what we were talking about.  Since the server had taken the quesadilla we had nothing to show him.  As far as I am concerned that management mentality will not work its way out the like the service hiccups probably will.",

We spent $10.75 for table side guacamole, it was horrible, it was one avocado, pico, and pomegranate seeds, then doused in like juice, the avocado was not mashed it was chunks... We could barley eat it. We ordered the 3 tacos for $10 and they were bite sized. The server was very negligent of our needs and made us feel very unwelcome... I would not suggest this place!

You can order any of their 20 street tacos for only $2.50 each and they have a variety of drinks for $3 each, I'm in!    I typically get 3 different tacos for a variety but can only ever finish about 2 of them fully.  I get the pollo, carne asada and chile relleno (it's delicious but very spicy so beware).  For the price the tacos are amazing, don't be afraid to experiment, after all they are only $2.50!   The service is hit and miss depending on your server.  My favorite is Veronica, she is sooo sweet and knows the menu like the back of her hand.  She really makes the experience so much better.    I have yet to try any entrees, I think the tacos are the best deal on the menu and i dont want to stray away from them.  It is interesting that the chips and salsa are $3, but if you are with a group, they amount to about $1, so just think of it that way! :)   P.S. With the right server, you end up with bottomless chips and salsa so the money is well spent!",

I asked for options that were Gluten free and Dairy free. Barrio Queen, please educate yourself on this topic. We sat at a bar booth for dinner, ordered table side guacamole for two. Let me just say this is my first experience EVER ordering $11 guacamole and it not being made at the table! Instead it came out in cubes with some pomegranate seeds sprinkled on top. There was no salt, no lime, no mashing, no nothing, but the sweet waitress \"threw some salsa on the side, just cause\". Wow..thanks, feeling \"special\" After our guacamole we order some Pozole, which I will give them credit for, it was good. We also ordered street tacos, 3 for $10, or 1 for $3.50. My fiance ordered the Huevo con Chorizo, Suadero Azteca,and the Nopalitios. The Nopalitis was good, but the rest were luke warm, no salt and pretty much an epic fail at trying to make a Mexican taco. Our waiter recommend I try the Salmon y Nopal taco and Huitlacoche y Champion taco. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOH.MY&s=e51333289de4d89694c660117daae82bcacef02fb0bc5ff261a720d9db5b7652\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OH.MY</a>.CRAP. The salmon taco smelled like the seafood market in Chinatown. I had one bite and passed it off to my old man, he can eat about anything and find some sort of appreciation for it, but not this sad salmon taco. Mushroom taco, was lacking even the flavor of the mushroom. How one achieves that is beyond me.  The margaritas were decent, I recommend just having those and some \"cubed\" guacamole.",

    "text": "As long time friends & fans of Barrio Cafe, my husband and I were anxious to determine whether the downer reviews of BQ were for real...It's hard to believe that Silvana would allow her name and work to be compromised. Alas, after our visit today at lunch, we were very relieved to enjoy a very nice meal that represented Silvana well. We ordered three wonderful tacos (fish, chicken y chorizo, and shrimp), chile verde, a mole tamale (the mole was AWESOME) and some very tasty guacamole. My husband is a chile verde connoisseur (which means he eats it a LOT) and said the flavors were rich and complex, and better than traditional chile verde. The black beans that came with his chile verde were *clearly* made from scratch, with an unmistakably homemade flavor.  I have yet to determine if we are salt deprived or if restaurants in general err on the side of less salt -- it is a matter of personal taste -- and with a couple of dashes of salt, the flavors of our meal delighted us.   For full disclosure, we did not have any alcoholic beverages (loved the water with thick, juicy lemon slices...mmm!)  and found that the price of lunch was very reasonable, considering our \"full\" factor when we were finished. My husband and I had been to this location when it was a French bistro (which I really did not like, mostly because of the ambience/layout of the restaurant) but Silvana has done a fantastic job of creating a fun, stylish, and festive atmosphere. I'm looking forward to visiting again!  PS As for the naysayers like Jordan -- who I believe sat behind us at lunch (the guy bitching about the size of the tacos before he even ordered one?) -- sometimes people just bring their unhappiness with them wherever they go...If you want a \"big\" taco for $2, Taco Bell awaits you...",

Bartender was excellent and we had fast service. I ordered the Arizona Burrito - Very Tasty!. However... My friend ordered the 3 for $10 tacos. He asked how big they were and they said street taco size. 3 should do it. When they were served the tacos made us start laughing. The tortilla was about 3\" across. No kidding they were honestly one bite each. He did think they were great tasting though.We also ordered a tres leche desert. Very average.  One bloody maria, one soda, a burrito, 3 tiny tacos and a desert. $40 Plus tip. Won't be my first choice of places to return to but it is downtown Scottsdale....",

Only rule is we only go to locally-owned family restaurants. Last night it was Barrio Queen in Scottsdale and the food was incredible. Drinks list had about 60 different tequilas, so that was the starter along with Negro Modelo beer on draft and queso fundido (Mexican fondue + chorizo) with chips. I had their amazing cochinita pibil - slow-roasted pork (14 hours) marinated in sour orange and achiote chili paste, and served with pickled sour orange onions and pico de gallo, plus arroz verde and frijoles negros,,,,,,,, Damn it was good. Meat was from the heart of the roast with strands of tender pork 3-4 inches long; amazing flavors and tender as a lover's kiss. Finished off with flan & excellent whisky/caramel sauce, and after ordering coffee and heading to the men's room, I came back to a plunger pot of excellent French press waiting for me. That is a great finish. Nice Joynt - TVS said he's be taking his wife there soon",

    "text": "I LOVE this place. My friend and I came for AZ Restaurant Week last month and everything was so delicious, I couldn't wait to go back. When another friend of mine suggested Barrio Queen for my belated birthday lunch, i was super down! While I couldn't have their yummy margarita (boo work day), I wholeheartedly enjoyed everything I ate.   The bean dip and chips they provide is solid. Then, of course, you have to order the guacamole! They'll make it as mild or spicy as you want and table side! Big chunks of avocado, freshly chopped peppers, pomegranate...SO GOOD!  My friend ordered the Pozole and seemed really happy with it. I ordered 3 tacos: the Cochinita Pibil (which they're known for), the Relleno, and the Camaron. I love me some shrimp tacos so the Camaron did not disappoint. The Relleno is pretty much carne asada with a roasted jalapeno at the bottom...spicy and fantastic! The Cochinita Pibil is marinated pork and it was so juicy and yom yom yom.  The customer service was also top notch. A woman (possibly the manager) came by and asked my friend if she wanted a to-go container for her Pozole. My friend said yes, but then our waiter came by and took her bowl. When the woman came back with the container, we realized he wasn't taking the bowl to transfer it to the container. The woman felt so bad she offered to have some more made to put in the container. My friend didn't want to put anyone out, so she politely declined. Then the woman offered her guacamole to go, to which she said YES! It was really so kind of her to go above and beyond like that for a simple mistake.   Oh and they surprised me with the Flan for dessert for my birthday and it was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.com&s=ac71b33d32e90570e9c0d70edf9b4cac5f20e98e10501794c62801370f5dd3f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.com</a>.

After we were seated, we didn't see anyone for a quite awhile, but when he walked by, I jokingly asked him if he would be our server and he took us on and had a good sense of humor about it. 5 stars for service! The meal was very good. Our party tried a variety of dishes including the Carnitas Michoacanas and the Cochinita Pibil. There wasn't anything outstanding about the dishes, but they were well-executed. The best parts were, oddly enough, the black beans and the hand-pressed corn tortillas. The other two in our party seemed to really enjoy their tacos, so perhaps that's the stand-out dish here. I was just happy to see a local restaurant doing so well on a Wednesday evening and I'll definitely be back to try the tacos.",

For appetizer we had the guacamole, which they made at the table, always a plus.  The combination of spices, pomegranate seeds and avocado was excellent, a bit too much lime juice as it was kind of runny, but was still very tasty.  For the entree, we had the 3 tacos for $10, and went for the pork, which came highly recommended by our waiter, who was very good.  Carnitas were excellent, chorizo also dynamite (we actually had the chorizo with a fried egg on top, awesome) and the brisket was also excellent.  Fish was good, but not as good as the pork or beef, stick to the pork or beef when you go there, they are much better.  For dessert we split a churro, which was incredible, came with a caramel dipping sauce that was to die for.  Overall the food was excellent, price was reasonable and service was good.  Only thing preventing this from getting 5 stars was that the Guacamole was a little bit runny and the service at first was slightly slow, other than that, dynamite.  I'd definitely go back.",

It took 20 minutes for him even to speak to us. The side table guacamole had no flavor and the rest of our food was horrible. To sum it up bad service from the minute to get the restaurant, bad food, expensive drinks and food.

Friends from back home had recommended this place and the wife is half Mexican so  I figured they knew what they were talking about and they surely did! The first day we came here for lunch, arrived about 11:30 and there was comfortable and prompt seating. We had the Carne Asada salad and it just hit the spot after our flight, arrival and getting settled in.  We then came back deliberately early on a Saturday night and by 5 PM there was a line out front, the hostess was already taking reservations on her iPad at the door, and she said she would phone us when a table was ready. She said 35 minutes and it was 35 minutes on the dot. Both times that we went to Barrio Queen our server was Phillip. He was prompt, professional, friendly and  informative when we asked him the usual touristy questions. For dinner on our second visit, we had one order Chicken Enchilada Mole and one Camarones (prawns)  al Mojo de Ajo (estilo Guaymas) and both were delicious. Even the chips and salsa were fresh and tasty. This obviously popular place manages the crowds very well. The bar on our evening visit was all  but stampeded with diners waiting to be seated but somehow the bartending staff smiled, jammed and everyone got served promptly. It seemed like the patrons were very happy, to include the staff, so that says a lot about what appears to be a very prospering enterprise.",

    "text": "I have ordered delivery from Barrio Queen twice. The first time we ordered both the Caldo Tlalpino (Chicken Soup) and the Pozole Verde.  Both were good, but such tiny portions that I thought it must have been a mistake.  $8 and $9 respectively for barely a cup of soup is ridiculous, no matter how good it is, and both were very flavorful.    We also ordered  the Barrio Pollo burrito, which was quite good, although slightly underseasoned.    Although the prices are so high, we decided to give Barrio Queen another try, this time leaving out the insanely expensive soup.      We had the guacamole, which was decent, somewhat bland, but insanely overpriced for the small amount. For $10.75 we were expecting a portion large enough to share,  but it barely satisfied two of us.  We definitely would have wanted more, were the accompanying tortilla chips not thick and almost too hard to bite through.    We had a side of veggies, which was mostly zucchini and corn, completely unseasoned. Along with that we ordered the Azteca burrito in anticipation of the \"delicately slow-roasted beef brisket\".   Instead we got a pile of flavorless chewy strings.   But the best was the part where we suddenly began pulling hairs out of our mouths.   The burrito was literally loaded with human hair.  Can you hear us gagging?  I am still gagging as I write this review.  I complained about the food through the review function of Door Dash, the delivery service, which quickly responded with a credit for our next purchase and a promise to forward the complaint to the restaurant, so we waited for a response from Barrio Queen, but none has been forthcoming.   That does not indicate the kind of customer care and concern for quality that one would expect from an expensive restaurant like Barrio Queen.    Not recommended if you like to receive value for what you pay for, but highly recommended for those who enjoy chewing on long greasy strands of black hair along with your bland and overcooked highly priced food.",

Guacamole tableside is another must order.   The reason I dont give it 5 stars is the service. It gets super crowded and it can take a little while for things to get moving. Last time I was there (this only happened once) we had to flag the hostess to even get a waitress. While this has not been my experience every time, it sometimes is a little slower than I'd prefer. But to be clear, this is NOT a barrier to going. Food more than makes up for it if its a little slow!!",

As someone who's loved the original Barrio Cafe for the decade or so its been open, Barrio Queen is a worthy addition to the lineup. For those who are used to the original, Barrio Queen is just as tasty, but has a little more room and better parking.  Whether you go for the three tacos for $10, the Cochinitas Pibil torta sandwich, an enchilada, quesadilla or anything else on the menu, you will likely be happy.  Because it was my birthday, we also decided to try the desserts. I thought the chocolate cake was delicious and my coworkers liked the churros.  I haven't been there at night, but I hear the margaritas and other drinks are tasty as well.  My only complaint is that they seemed a little understaffed at lunch. One waitress seemed to be handling the whole place and as nice as she was, she was a little overwhelmed so at times we had to try and flag her down for service.  All in all though, Barrio Queen is one of my favorite restaurants in Downtown Scottsdale.",

Before we went I called and asked if we were ok to bring our own cake to sing and celebrate for my sister.. This is where I'm annoyed and give this restaurant 1 star so I call and they say \"yes sure but it will be a $5 charge per person.\" So let me get this straight, we are bringing a cake and you are charging me to cut it? I even asked if I could bring my own plates and cut it myself and they said if I did that it would be a $3 charge per person. This is just so dumb to me, there was 15 of us and i couldnt believe they wanted to charge us to bring our own cake! We ended up going and not taking a cake, food was ok. Nothing special, and we ended up spending over $300 dollars. Service was ok nothing great and I definitely won't be going back!",

    "text": "My fiance was raving about this place at lunch so we decided to try it for dinner. We love mexican food and wish there was more around Scottsdale. This ended up being a weird experience for us! Let's start from the beginning... Go up to the hostess and ask to sit outside as its a perfect night.  She apologetically shook her head no and explained there were reservations coming to fill the tables we saw open.  No big deal right, so we sit inside where we were lead to a corner table by the window.  After about 2mins I noticed the AC was blaring. I figured I could stick it out, not like it is 110 outside yet!  After looking at the menu which was explained to us the sangria sounded refreshing. Come to find out you have to order a $29 pitcher or a single cup that happens to have jack daniels in it. I don't know too much about sangria, but I know I don't like jack and couldn't get the kind in a pitcher by the glass... I ordered the Arizona Burrito it came with green chile pork or red with cheese and enchilada sauce on top. I ordered the green chile pork. After ordering our food the cold becomes a bit much.  I look over and a plant by the door had leaves blowing the AC was so strong. Not wanting to complain we ask our server if the air could be turned down a little.  She reports she has to ask the manager to turn it down.  She comes back and reports the manager said it can't be turned down but told his we can move across the way and it's still her section. My wine finally arrives not long after we moved, less frigged area by the way!  The food wait time was pretty average. First glance at my burrito there was green sauce on top, no big deal as I ordered green chile right...as I cut into my burrito the meat was red chile...thinking maybe they mixed up my order as my impression of what I ordered is green chile pork on the inside and red sauce on top of the burrito, I think maybe I read the menu wrong or maybe they meant salsa verde is green chile sauce. IDK! regardless, not wanting to complain and starving I ate it! quite delicious with just the right amount of spice! Halfway into my burrito I pick up the next bite and hear a HUGE shatter in my head...my fiance asked 'was that a bone?' shocked I shake my head no! spitting everything out of my mouth into a napkin I see a piece of PLATE! i bit a piece of plate and even broke off a piece! checking my teeth I was relieved to not have broken any! We call the server over who apologizes we know its not her fault.  She said she let mgmt know.  She came back took my plate, offered to give us dessert which we refused, said that never happens, and asked us not to not ever come back because of this! needless to say our meal was comp, and the manager never did come over. hopefully he was in the kitchen alerting the staff about the bottom of the plate rims which according to the server protrude and are fragile... what a dining experience, and after all was done I was still hungry so we went and O got appetizers somewhere else! More disappointed about how it was handled with Mgmt...who gets plate pieces in their burrito!?",

Most of the complaints appear to center around the place being overly busy (really?) or the service being poor. While the service certainly wasn't fantastic-our waiter disappeared on occasion and came off as cold, though he warmed up as the night went on-I don't think it warrants dropping the star rating. Started with the guacamole, which is overpriced but excellent - chunks of avocado with pomegranate seeds, fig, and a few other fresh items thrown in for good measure. I ordered the street tacos and each one was better than the previous - got the conchinita pibil, suedo azteca(brisket), and salmon y mango. The brisket in particular was incredibly tender and flavorful. They are on the small side but also stuffed with filling so I was satisfied after 3. My wife and I also split a coffee press, which was some of the best coffee I have ever tasted and cost us $3 for about two cups each. So, while the food may be somewhat expensive for what get in terms of size, it's also fresh, flavorful, and unique.",

    "text": "I am a huge fan of Barrio Cafe.  Yes, I agree the service can be snooty on occasion, but the food is awesome!!  I was thrilled, but a little worried that Silvana was opening not 1 but 2 restaurants in downtown Scottsdale.  She was also supposed to pen a spot in Gilbert, but I guess it fell through due to lease negotiations.  Anyway, I ate at the fancier Silvana's on a Sunday afternoon.  I sat at the bar.  The restaurant was empty except for the patio which had some tables occupied.  The bartender was sweet but inexperienced.  She gave me a basil infused margarita with no basil - ha ha.  It took 2-3 tries to fix it, and it was just okay.  The menu was confusing as there was a set of menus outside, but what I received inside was different.  Couldn't tell if serving lunch/brunch or both.  I ordered the enchiladas Silvana.  It took a long time to receive and the bartender said it was because they shared a kitchen with Barrio Queen and they were slammed.  They arrived eventually and were lukewarm but tasty.  This place would do a great business if they just imported the menu from Barrio Cafe.  I witnessed a fight among servers over tables.  Young female waitress being bullied by older male waiter (reminded me of the NYC Little Italy waiter).  I was happy to hear her hold her own!  The following week I went to Barrio Queen for lunch and sat at the bar.  I immediately noticed the cramped environment.  The servers, cooks, etc. seemed crammed in this space.  The restaurant was kind of warm, which is a little disconcerting given it is Jan. in AZ.  It's only going to get hotter!  I ordered a glass of wine, and received a carafe with no more than 3 oz. of wine!!  It was a little tiny, baby carafe.  Very cute, but not for $9.  I ordered a couple of tacos, but the server needed me to repeat multiple times and then point to them on the menu.  One came out right away.  The second one came out about 15 min. later.  Strange.  Flavors were good, but the cochinita pibil had too much pickled veg and juice spilling out.    My advice to Silvana would be to just combine the 2 restaurants into one reasonably sized space, convert the menu to a combo of the taco shop//Barrio Cafe favorites.  It seems a waste to have the fancy space sit empty while the taco space is packed.  Now I understand why my enchiladas at Silvanas were cold--no one from Barrio Queen is trained to expedite the food over to Silvanas--pretty bad practice given the premium prices at Silvanas.   Train the staff, figure out the logistics of having staff and customers move around without bumping into each other.  And last, please explain why there were 2 bags of Tostitos behind the bar?!?",

    "text": "After getting a mention in USA today, I decided I wanted to try it out while visiting in March. That discussion with family turned into a group of 22 of us going on a Monday evening. 22 is a very large group, but WOW they could not have screwed it up more. It took my parents over 90 minutes to receive any food from the time we sat down, while others had already finished their tacos and entrees. Orders came out with the server constantly confused with who gets what. We had pitchers of Margaritas that seemed to have zero alcohol. I thought this place was supposed to be known for their eclectic tacos. Seriously average. It gets worse. The waiter tried to screw us and charge us $56.00 per pitcher due to premium liquor that we had cleared stated we were not interested in. The manager took $400.00 off our tab, but still wanted to tax us and auto-tip us based on the original amount. Maybe the experience was so bad for all of us that our opinions were jaded, but not one person in our crew was impressed by the food.",

I cannot tell you how disappointed I was when 10 of my best Taco Tuesday buds arrived and were refused service as they were closing the restaurant at 8:00pm on a Taco Tuesday night.  I would understand the economics of this had the restaurant been completely empty; however with 25-30 patrons at various stages of service, my group of 10 at the door, and a party of 4 walking in behind us - I was confused and embarrassed. Never  before have I experienced such poor customer service.  What a disappointment to see such a fine restaurant derailed by such poor management. It was nice knowing you Barrio Queen.",

I had the mariscos relleno and it was delicious - only a little spicy with a tasty sauce and plenty of crab and shrimp stuffing. The mashed potatoes were delicious, but I could do without the calabacitas (veggies). The carnitas were lean enough for a very picky eater and the tortillas looked great - he ate them all before I got a chance to snag one.",

    "text": "So to celebrate Cinco de Mayo last night my wife and I were eager for a margarita. We decided would try Barrio Queen. We had been there before late at night and really liked it. We bring the kids, 14, 10, and 5. Okay that's a little risky but it's not a quiet place and my kids are pretty well behaved and they want to celebrate too. So it was an unusually perfect night out out and as we walked up at 6 pm there were lots of spots on the patio. We asked for a patio seat and we're told 30-45 minutes. Kind of a surprise but okay. So after 1:15 we are still waiting as party after party arrive well after us and fill up the patio. We finally said we would sit anywhere and eventually get seated at an indoor table. We get one of those tables down the main aisle with a booth bench on one side and chairs on the other. Not perfect for a family but whatever. Just got worse after that. Can't find our server, then can't get our drinks. Takes another 20 minutes just to finally get a margarita. Finally order. The food comes in bursts with some of us finished eating before other food arrives. Our table side guacamole appetizer gets served after we are all done eating our entrees. It was bizarre. Seemed deliberately kid UNFRIENDLY. Worst service I have had out in over 10 years and we eat out frequently.  To give you an idea, I have never written a negative review until now.  What a bummer.",

When the tacos finally arrived the person who delivered them informed that one of the tacos (pork carnitas) which is one of their specialties was not available and that I needed to reorder with my server. By this time everyone in my party had their food. The server told us the kitchen did not inform her they were out of the carnitas. I reordered but 30 minutes later I still did not have my order and so we cancelled it. Took another 15 minutes to get the check. Very poor management! No teamwork! The server is the victim of poor management. The food that we did get was good. Several people were asking for their servers and two managers were running around trying to respond, but they were very disorganized!",

Were there not enough servers?? Actually no it seemed as if there were an abundance of staff around.   We ordered off the sushi style taco menu.... we ordered a total of 9 different tacos.  Not only did we not get the right tacos, but our waitress couldn't even tell which ones were which.   As soon as she left a busser came over and asked if he could remove any plates....are you kidding me?  We just got our food.  In the end the chorizo overpowered many of the other flavors and the tacos were mediocre at best.  Definitely not worth the $3-4.00 each price tag for a three bite street taco, especially when you've waited almost 45 minutes for them.   We also ordered a fondue appetizer which actually turned out to be a wad of overly stringy cheese with some sausage and mushrooms mixed in... totally impossible to eat and clearly not what you would expect a fondue to be.   Don't get me wrong, I LOVE food and I especially love Mexican food, but for the price (and knowing the chef from barrio cafe) I expected much more.  I will NEVER go to this restaurant again.",

What I particularly loved was while they were making the table-side quac the server made us feel part of the process. Asking how spicy we wanted it and showing all of the ingredients as they were added. We did end up switching servers part-way through, but the same high energy service we received at the beginning was carried out through the entire dinner. My only suggestion (hence the 4 star opposed to the 5 star), is that once we had finished the first basket of tortilla chips we were not given a second. This was only an issue for the fact that there were 4 of us and half a bowl of guac left. We did end up receiving a second basket after we asked. Other then that the night was exceptional! Keep up the good work!  Unfortunately, I cannot remember our first server's name, but the second was Ronald. With this top notch service this restaurant will remain in business a long time.",

    "text": "Really disappointed experience...me and my boyfriend went there for dinner this past weekend. We got there around 7 and we were placed on the waitlist because it was really busy, we got a text message saying they would let us know when our table was ready... we waited until 8pm and checked back with the hostess she told us that we weren't on the waitlist, my boyfriend showed her the text message and they gave us a table literally right next to the door. I understand they are a busy place and it's a weekend night but I am really disappointed by this place the guacamole was subpar, the food was ok not great. The customer service so bad our server was more attentive to the table of four next to us and it took them so long to get anything to our table. With that being said if you are looking for some good tacos well priced guacamole and excellent customer service I'll save you all some time and go to (Diego Pops or Loco Patron) down the road even Mr. Mesquite street tacos  overall way better and worth the price.",

    "text": "We came to this restaurant as travelers from Portland, having been raised in California, looking for a decent Mexican meal. However, we were on foot and none of the four-star restaurants were in reach, so we decided on the lovely outdoor patio of Barrio Queen.  I concur with the 3.5-star rating. If I only had the chips, salsa and guacamole and my Margarita Brava (jalapeno-infused), it would have been a 4-star. Unfortunately, I selected the Queso do Cabra salad as a healthy complement to my indulgence. I liked the mixed greens, which were fresh. The idea of the roasted corn and poblanos was a good one, but the vinaigrette was bitter and didn't go with the salad and the goat cheese seemed like an afterthought. My husband had three tacos, which he said were good and are definitely more the direction you want to go if you visit Barrio Queen.  Their patio is lovely and there is a lot of foot traffic nearby and few cars, so ambiance was a definite plus. Service was good.",

It did not disappoint, but as often is the case when one revisits places that have been elevated to legendary status in one's memories,.. somehow the place did have the same buzz happening. Then it was fresh and trending, almost felt like it was ready to undertake a national expansion, now it's just a good dependable restaurant,.. which is a good thing, right? Right! So I recommend Barrio Queen for good food and good times.",

The chicken enchiladas were also delicious and the margaritas are authentic with lime juice, no sweet and sour mix here! We sat outside on the patio which has heat lamps so it was comfortable for the winter and there was live music which made it a great evening! We will definitely be back and try the other locations!",

To start with I ordered the Cocktel De Elote - grilled corn cut off the cobb, topped with butter, mayo, cotija cheese, valentina, cilantro and lime , this reminds me of when my kids where younger and chasing some dude on a bike with cooler for some corn. But its all grown up now and no longer in a cooler. This appetizer is great! Love the flavors! I could make a meal just out of this!  For lunch I went with 3 tacos for $10, I ordered one carne asada taco and 2 Barrio pollo tacos. The carne asada was tender, it was topped with diced onions, cilantro and avocado, and the Barrio pollo taco was diced chicken, caramelized onions, roasted poblano peppers with a spicy cream sauce topped with queso fresco. Both of these tacos where delish!      This was a great meal, service was excellent too! Look forward to coming back.",

Many different options for tacos they are street tacos so there pretty small considering the price. But definitely worth it in my opinion. Ive come here many times with friends and I always got tacos except for one time. My date decided to get the Sonoran dog. I mean for one who gets a hotdog at a Mexican place, none the less I tried it considering my date was unpleased. I wasnt a fan of the taste or the hard bread. Also the fries that came with it were dull. Leaving on a high note, I highly recommend this place for traditional Mexican foods tacos, burritos,enchiladas, tortas  etc. avoid the Americanized options. Great service, great food, 4 stars for the brick breaded sonoran dog.",

You won't find greasy and tasteless refried beans and rice here.  Instead, you'll find amazing dishes with delicious sides like calabacitas and charro beans.  My daughter ordered the carne asada enchiladas and said they may be the best enchiladas she's ever had.  The rest of us ordered several different tacos and they were all delicious.  EVERY SINGLE ONE.  We didn't order alcoholic beverages this time around because we were driving, but we had other options.  The agua frescas are refreshing and yummy.  I went with the hibiscus flower flavor and really enjoyed it.  Delicious chips and salsa are always a giveaway that you're in for a treat and that was also the case at Barrio Queen.  Because it was a beautiful spring Friday evening, we chose to sit outside on the patio.  Great decision.  The ambiance was perfect.  The service was quick and friendly.  We couldn't have asked for a better experience.  Can't wait to return and try something new!",

It's a great spot and there was a guy on harmonica doing some Stevie Wonder on  the patio, pretty cool.This place has a great vibe with a casual upscale feel.  The service is right on here and friendly, chips and salsa and drinks were served right away. I ordered soup and two tacos each time. First I tried a cup of Albondigas soup, which is actually small bowl and very good. the fish tacos were great. Today I tried a cup of Caldo Tlalpeno soup, it was very good with pieces of chicken, vegetables in a broth with chunks of avocados floating on top. A shrimp and a fish taco, both very good.

I have been to barrio Queen several times and I didn't realize how much I disliked it here.   3 stars for service, 2 stars for food, and 0 stars for value and there is no rounding up. It's a rule. This has nothing to do with money but the quality and taste to how much...here we go.  So my buddy is in town from out of state and we decided to go to barrio queen instead of the 3000 other Mexican restaurants in Arizona (just mentioning that we have choices) and he also drove 20+ minutes to meet me and was out of his way to come here.   The service was fine and probably the best part of the trip even though it was still...eh. A little slow but the gentleman was nice. He was a tad busy on the patio but also didn't really watch the tables he was serving. Nonetheless he was let awful and was good.   The chips and salsa are fine. I honestly have made my own salsa and it was comparable and the chips were big and greasy.  I order the queso dip with no mushrooms. Came out correct. However this Cheese I felt was not melted enough nor was the chorizo very tasty. The hatch green Chiles were fine, but again the cheese was not anything I was running home about. And it was $11. There is nothing special about this to be charging $11. It makes no sense to me.  I order the carne Assad's burrito with beans on the side. Good came out correct which is always good. The beans were flavorless and nothing special about them and I am glad I got them on the side and not in the burrito. I think they do that to fill it up and not put as much meat IMO. So the burrito is $15. Again nothing special at all and no excitement about the flavors or taste. It was just whatever. I have had way better burritos for half the price. My friend orders the enchiladas and said they were good I didn't try them so I can't comment.   The bill with tip for 3 items no drinks mind you, only water was $55. Tell me how on earth is that even right??? $55 for a subpar lunch and decent service. I mean I literally could have went anywhere in old town that has way better food and service for $30. Diego pops or corn agaves is down the street. I've been to both and barrio Queen doesn't cut it.   I won't be back honestly unless someone demands it and is going to pay. Sorry BQ I am not a fan anymore. Too bad, I just don't enjoy bad meals.",

We tried the barrio pollo, camaron asado, cochinita pibil, and carne asada y huevo tacos. My favorite item, by far, was the carne asada y huevo, in which the fried egg added a nice twist to the taco and enhanced the carne asada flavor to take the taco to a whole different level of bondad!!! Kudos to the chef who came up with that idea! Their queens cooler margarita was quite tasty as well, but the rest of the tacos and the elote was a wash. Wish I could give this experience more stars, but hopefully when I come back next time and try some other items, I'll be blown away!!!",

The Jalapeno margarita and their award winning skinny margarita were both top notch. I had the street tacos (Carne Asada, a fish taco and chicken taco)...absolutely fantastic!

I lucked out since there aren't many places open before 3PM in Old Town Scottsdale during the week and this was one of the few restaurants open at 1:30 PM. We started with the papas on the appetizer menu, at the recommendation of our server, we mixed the corn and pork - WOW!!!   I had the 3 tacos for $10. You can mix your selections. I picked the grilled pescado, pork chili rellano and the barrio pollo. All were very good. The pork with the chili was a pleasant surprise as it was SPICY!!! I love spicy food and this did not disappoint but I was told that it is just the luck of the draw, because it all depends on the jalapeno they put on the taco. If you like spicy though, I highly recommend trying your luck.  My six year old ordered the hot dog off the kids menu, it came with choice of a side. She chose the rice and kept raving about it (this child doesn't like anything).   The server was great. Yvette was very welcoming. I highly recommend this place.",

They put pomegranate seeds in it which was surprising at first but I really liked the unusual addition! They also have really good chips, which can make or break a Mexican restaurant experience for me, pun intended.   Next I did the three taco deal. I tried the Cochinita Pibil, Carne Asada, and Pescado tacos. I wish I spent more time eating them because I'm not proud to admit they were gone within minutes. Granted they are small street tacos, they are packed with flavor!   Between the chips w/guac, an amber dos equis on draught, and three tacos, I was smitten (as my Zach would say).

The lime juice was especially overpowering. I did enjoy the crunch of the pomegranate seeds.  California enchiladas: Not a fan of the five chile red sauce, which had a smoky/spicy flavor and not much else going on. The inside of the enchiladas reminded me of the cheese inside a mozzarella stick after it's been sitting there a while. I'm all for vegetables, but the side of zucchini didn't have any special flair and just seemed kind of random.  Churro: Queen of the barrio, as far as I'm concerned.

The guacamole is made fresh, table side, and depending on the time of year includes fresh pomegranate seeds (or craisins when pomegranate is out of season). It seems that the only time people are disappointed is if they stray from the a la carte tacos and look towards the entrees which tend to be a bit pricier and not as good of a value. It can be a bit pricey unless you're there for taco Tuesday or happy hour, but, is still a more affordable and almost as great of an option as somewhere more \"upscale\" in Old Town like The Mission.",

The tacos are really tasty, and are the only reason I go back, because their service is certainly nothing to return for. When they first opened I figured they were still working the kinks out with their servers. Since they opened in 2012 and it is now 2014 and the service remains the same, if not worse, I am led to believe they just don't care that their servers are absolutely ignorant to how to serve people as well as being ignorant to customer service skills. From sitting at a table and waiting over 10 min to even be asked for a glass of water (only after I complained, mind you), to the same server continually getting portions of my entire  parties order wrong on several different visits, to absent waiters who act put out when you have to keep asking for things because you've been waiting for an extended amount of time even when the restaurant isn't busy....one can only conclude that they don't care about their customers as they keep these incompetent imbeciles employed at their establishment. If the tacos weren't so tasty I would certainly never return.",

    "text": "I was really excited to try out Barrio Queen having been to the Barrio Cafe and loved that experience. I especially raved about the guac to my friends and we all agreed to go there for Cinco de Mayo. Overall the food was average, the drinks decent but the service was AWFUL. We got there on May 5th at about 3pm. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived but was packed by dinner time. The good stuff: they do have great happy hour specials with 2 tacos for $3, $3 drafts and $3 casa margs. And that's about it. The rest of the menu is pretty pricey, both for drinks and for food. The conchinita pibil is delicious and certainly worth it's reputation. The tacos were pretty tasteless and very dry (like \"eating jerky\" dry). No matter what some of the servers say, they actually do have salsa there so get either the red or green, it makes the tacos so much better. The casa marg is OK, but hardly a stand out. However the red sangria is really tasty. They put a mango puree at the bottom and it's light and refreshing without being too sweet. One of my friends is really into tequilas and the restaurant stocks over 300 varieties. She was really happy on that score. Unfortunately the service was terrible and turned what should have been a 2 hour 'drinks and dinner' event into a 5 hour saga. Bottom line, there are too many other places in the Valley that are really good, reasonably priced and have consistently good service. I hope they get their service issues sorted but it will be a long long time before I ever end up back there.  The service *sigh* If it weren't for the bizarre service I would probably have given this place 3 stars because of the sangria and the conchinita pibil. Anyway, the hostess was MIA when we arrived to the restaurant and it took almost 20 minutes just to find her. We then sat at our table for 15 minutes before our server finally came over.  So the first thing we ordered was the guac and chips. I've had the guacamole at the Barrio Cafe and it is awesome. The guac at Barrio Queen was almost all onions tossed in a little bit of avocado. We also watched, perplexed, as the tables after us all had their chips and guac prepared table-side, with the option of customizing the ingredients. We were not offered this option so I asked our server if I had ordered the wrong appetizer. She said that she had been too busy earlier (when the restaurant was empty) and just had the kitchen \"throw it together\" for her. We asked if we could have some salsa to go with our guac and she said they didn't make salsas at the Barrio Queen. What kind of Mexican restaurant doesn't have salsa? Turns out the 2nd page of the menu says that they have bottomless salsas. We asked a different server and he brought out a red and a green salsa. FYI, they do not have a chips & salsa app but they do have little sides of salsa which we weren't charged for. I guess the trick was to ask for salsa *only* because if you use the words 'chips' and 'salsa' in the same sentence they'll tell you they \"don't do that.\" So bizarre.  It routinely took half an hour from the time we ordered a round of drinks until they all arrived. When we asked how the drinks were coming along several times they told us that the keg was being changed out. OK, I admit I don't know much about beverage distribution but I've never heard of margaritas or sangria being served from kegs. We had to flag people down to get our water refreshed, no one ever offered. They also wouldn't clear away empty glasses or plates unless we asked. At one point we had 13 empty glasses on the not-very-big-to-begin-with table.  When our food arrived we noticed that the plate had chorizo tacos, not the carnitas that we ordered. The server said he knew that(!) but the servers had been told the happy hour tacos were carnitas while the kitchen had been told they would be chorizo. We started to say we didn't want chorizo and he just walked away. We flagged down our actual server and he said we had to keep the chorizo tacos even though no one wanted them. He did eventually apologize for the mistake and we got the carnitas tacos and at the happy hour price.",

Then to the food:  The salsa was good but the tortilla chips were the thick, extremely hard kind and I felt like my teeth were gonna break.  For an appetizer we ordered Vasito de Elote, which is fresh grilled corn cut from the cob, served in a cup, topped with butter, mayo, aged cotija cheese, Valentina hot sauce, cilantro, and lime.  It was delicious, but a very small portion.  Then my bf ordered Chile Verde which is slow cooked pork with garlic, onion, peppers and tomatillos served with flour tortillas.  He was very pleased and after having a little bit, I agree that it was delicious.  On to my choice which was the California enchiladas.  They're basic cheese enchiladas and I had them served with calabicitas and rice.  It wasn't necessarily bad, but it wasn't very good either.  The rice was bland.  It's hard to explain what was wrong with the enchiladas.  They were simple cheese enchiladas but not very cheesy and red enchilada sauce poured over the outside.  Just not cohesive, I guess is the best way to put it.  The best thing this place had going for it is that it was a beautiful day here in February and the patio had delightful ambiance.",

When my better half asked for a shot of beer to calm the tartness the bartender suggested adding more of the grapefruit soda....What? Total sour belly result and $28 later a lesson learned. Always disappointing when you know you could have made a better drink yourself at home.",

The highlight was a side order of the Barrio Papas that had the corn, goat cheese, salsa, etc.  That easily could have been my meal and I would have been happy with that.

I understand the energy ego and effort that went into making BQ special and it seemed no expense was spared but the honeymoon is over. Still a great location with numerous top Tequila choices and a some funky attractive people on Staff but wow...the thrill is gone. Management seem pretty stressed out here and the trickle down results in slightly above average service, food and the impression that the Corporate Accounting office had invisible GoPros watching over food costs and who knows what else. I guess it's hard to duplicate the love formula of Barrio Cafe forever or maybe the next project gets the special attention.  Sad indeed.",

    "text": "This is hard for me to write. We loved this place. Went there a few times a month and always had a great time. There were occasional hiccups, but there is everywhere. However, this last time we went, about a month ago, left me so upset and annoyed. We went for happy hour, had a great time, really liked our server and everything. He let us know that his shift was finishing up and we settled up with him because we were done ordering and just finishing up. Our bill was $73 and change. We wrote in a $20 tip on the line and my boyfriend wrote the total as $103 and change. Our server came by and grabbed the check after we had signed it. After he took it I realized that we did the math incorrectly and it should have been $93. I gave him the benefit of a doubt and didn't track him down thinking that he would do the right thing and close it out with a $20 tip. However, when it posted to my bank account it drew for the $103. I was rather insulted because $20 on $73 is a fantastic tip and we were still sitting there when he closed it out. He could have come back and asked us what we meant. I called the manager a couple nights later when it had posted on my bank account and explained what happened. She was very responsive and said that the GM would call me the following day. She took my side saying that he should have closed it out with a $20 tip. Needless to say, no one ever followed up with me. All I wanted was my $10 back. We've spent hundreds of dollars at barrio queen, always taking VERY good care of our servers, but we can't say we will go back. What a shady thing for a person to do, scam an extra $10 out of me. This entire thing has just left me shaking my head.",

The outdoor seating is pretty spacious and the food and drink selection are pretty good as well.  The decor is pretty neat as well but the overall setup of the restaurant is odd but not bearing on this review.  The chips and salsa were spot on for a quick treat and the Menudo (served only on the weekends) was AWESOME!  Can't say that I usually go for that first off but it didn't disappoint.  The bar manager \"Lost\" (seriously his name) was primo and super helpful in describing what were key items on the menu along with suggesting some great pairings.  I'll definitely be back for more action!",

It was incredibly flavorful and tender and was topped with really yummy veggies. Definitely get your own of this if you are sharing. The fried fish and fried shrimp ones were tasty too. This is a great place to try inventive tacos, but can get a little pricey. I think you need to ask for chips and salsa here, as they didn't bring us any without us asking, but once brought, it was tasty :)",

    "text": "Between food poisoning and poor customer service, I had an absolutely horrible experience at Barrio Queen. My boyfriend and I decided to visit here for some drinks and food on New Year's Day. After 10 minutes of being neglected at the first bar (where only one other person was sitting) we decided to move to the other bar where we were finally able to sit and order. My boyfriend had ordered something off the entree menu, which was good, but not worth the 18 dollars we spent on it. That night my boyfriend woke up around 2 am violently ill, waking up every 5-15 minutes to run to the bathroom. I had only had a small bite of his food, and found myself feeling nauseous all night just from that. When I called the next day to inform them, the manager Lucas was very apologetic and said he would have his boss call me to see if there was anything they could do.  I don't typically spend a lot of money on food but we had spent 100 dollars between food and drinks that night. When the director of operations (I believe his name was Chev or Chef) called me the next day, all he cared to say was that everything was up to standard and that there was nothing he could do for us. He claimed his temperature logs were accurate and that there were no other claims so it wasn't something he could help with. He stated it was probably a bug or the flu and that his food was not the cause because everything was \"up to standard.\" He seemed to care more about defending the quality of his food rather than attending to a customer that got very ill from it.  I've had food poisoning before and know what it looks like. Jolting up in the middle of the night to throw up, and then to be repeated every 5-15 minutes afterward until halfway through the next day, is not common for the flu or a bug as the director of operations tries to claim.  After wasting 100 dollars this visit, and hundreds of dollars spent here before with larger groups, I will be sure that I never visit here again.  The only pleasant people I would like to give credit to are the manager Lucas that I spoke with and our second bartender Ryan. They were both nice and good with customers.",

We both left very disappointed and hungry.   First we tried the El Rey Vasito de Elote which we were anxious to try since we've had this dish before in another restaurant.  This dish came out in a smallish cup and it was served with nothing, no chips.  I guess we were supposed to eat this with a spoon like some kind of corn pudding.  This dish has always been served with chips at other places, why not at the Barrio Queen?  Must say, it really wasn't that good and we didn't finish it.  We both ordered tacos and they were just ok.  Such a rip off these small 3 bite street tacos.  These tacos were served with 2 salsas...if you can call these 2 small containers of the most watered down \"salsa\" I've ever seen, and absolutely no taste, no chunks of tomatoes, peppers, nothing.  I find it funny the runner who brought out the salsa warned the red was spicy.  This place will be a hit with tourists since it's in a prime location.  The tourists can have this place, we will never be back.",

For starters the chips were very thick, and some were chewy as they were not cooked through.  I miss the bread and olive relish served at the cafe.  I had the chicken mole enchiladas, very little chicken, mostly cheese with a good but not great mole sauce.  My kids had black bean burros with rice, the burros were ok but the rice tasted like it was out of a box, no flavor and seemed like an after thought.  Wife had fish and shrimp tacos which she said were flavorful but too small to pick up without falling apart. The service was good but did not make up for the poor cuisine. In my opinion there are way too many excellent choices in this town for mexican food, I sadly will not be going back to Barrio Queen.",

The chilaquiles....paying the price we did for basically a plate full of chips lightly covered in salsa. Have I mentioned how pricey this place is?!

I ordered a moscow mule and it was great. Most of the table ordered burritos and they were HUGE. Extra $3.50 if you want rice and beans on the side of any dish.   I ordered the grilled fish tacos. Oh Man. Four tacos was not enough! Haha! I could have eaten like four more! Note to self for next time! The \"Full Size\" Nachos is def. enough for a whole table to enjoy oooh and they had Pacifico in Bottles! All great things.   I would def. return to Barrio next time we are in the area!",

Between us we ordered  a variety of tacos; Carne asada, suadero atzeca (brisket), carnitas,  pork chile verde y rayjas,.  I could not taste the difference between the carne asada and the brisket. The pork taco was more fat then meat. Terrible to bite into something and feel a gelatinous mass suddenly in your mouth.   To top it off the brisket taco was so soggy that when I picked it up liquid literally poured out of it onto the plate. The pork taco was also soggy.    The soggy issue occurred on both plates",

Once we got in, it took a while for a waiter to get to give us our chips and salsa and ask what beverages we would like. He eventually came over and asked what we would like to order after 25 minutes of being there. (Also, the chips didn't have any flavor and were hard) Our waiter didn't do a good job at making sure we had a re-fill on our drinks and chips and salsa, he would only stop by our table once every 20 minutes. The food took a while to cook so I expected it to be good, but boy was I wrong. I asked for a burrito with cheese and meat only and they added beans and everything on it. My mom's food was cold and my sister found a nat in her quesadilla. It was not worth the wait and money.",

Not particularly crowded with many open tables,  still 20 minute wait.  No problem since beautiful evening.  When 20 minutes became 25 or 30 without getting a table,  when we asked about the table we were greeted rudely and with disdain.  Since our visit was to introduce friends newly to the area.  Hope to recover throughout dinner. ..had to get our own place settings after 20 minutes and following appetizers....  The food is the saving grace.  Upgraded the rating from 2 stars to 3.",

It was super strong and had too much tequila in it, but I wasn't going to complain!  We started out with one of their specials, barrio papas. It was basically French fries with corn and cheese. I wasn't too impressed and wished I ordered the elote instead. I was surprised this was their \"especial de la casa\". We also got free chips and salsa. Salsa wasn't anything special.  What I did enjoy was the tacos. I had the Cochinita Pibil which was delicious. The pork with the pickled sour orange, pico de gallo and oranges hit the spot for me. The carnitas weren't bad either. I was told they are marinated in coke!   I wasn't particularly wowed by the restaurant as a whole, hence the 3 stars. However, I'd love to come back and give it another try!",

The chips and salsa were really good and complimentary, which is always nice! Our server was great and so friendly. I definitely want to come back and try more dishes and also a margarita!

For some reason, I've never stopped in until now. I was craving some Mexican food and saw that Barrio had amazing reviews from some of my favorite Yelpers! So I knew I had to go in and check it out for myself.   They have a special July menu with new drinks and entrees. My date and I both decided to order off that menu to try their newest specialties! I ordered the Camerones Ranchos and my date got the Trio of Tamales! Both dishes were incredibly rich with flavor and seasonings! You could tell how much effort they put into picking the freshest ingredients and cooking them with care! The shrimp in the Camerones Ranchos was the star of the dish! It complimented the spicy red sauce very well.   What made Barrio stand out so much besides the large assortment of food, was the welcoming atmosphere. The hostess got us in very quickly despite it being a crowded, Friday night! And our server was very patient with us as we looked over the menu trying to decide what to get! If you come in anytime in July, I highly recommend checking out their special menu!",

They call themselves Mexico City Soul Food - and while I had no idea what to really expect, I loved the atmosphere, the service and the food!  They have great cocktails to start your evening off right!  The drink menu alone is impressive, with specialty margaritas, cocktails, wines and more.  They even have a warning on the menu for a drink called \"Death's Door\"!  Their food menu has a large assorted Mexican food, but everything seems to have that extra love and flavor profile that kicks it up a notch.  I think I counted 25 types of tacos alone!  I tried the Carnitas, Pescado and Cameron tacos with a side of Rice.  The flavors were amazing and food cooked to perfection!  I would've loved to stay for dessert, but time was against me.  So I will need to venture back again to continue trying items on the menu.  They also have a great Happy Hour Menu!  Monday through Friday 2pm to 6pm.",

Both places have completely underwhelmed me.  The price you pay for what you get is absurd.  the flavors are OK at best and the menu is just meh.  I don't know what it is about this place but for a Mexican restaurant of which there are hundreds in AZ I can say that there are countless other choices I would pick over going to this place again.  Completely over rated and over priced.  Avoid at all costs and do some yelping for a different Mexican establishment in the area as you'll be happy that you did",

My photos just do it justice. The house tortilla chips were also warm which was a nice touch on a colder night.   This place is great for drinks, dinner and groups.

(2-6 pm We started out with their guacamole-freshly made at our table with pomegranate seeds, it was so fresh and good, l loved the flavor. Also had the Queso Fundido-Melted Oaxaca cheese topped with chorizo, sauteed mushrooms, roasted poblano peppers served with corn tortilla chips. That was great too. I do think they can improve on their chips.  Their were so many choices it was hard to choose! 3 of us ended up getting the Barrio Style Protein bowl-we got beef instead of chicken, romaine lettuce, Mexican style rice, black beans, pico de gallo, sauteed onions and poblano peppers, soy sauce and lime juice topped with queso fresco and a friend egg. It was very flavorful and fresh. Our other friend had different tacos and we tasted his charro beans which were super good! My husband and friend had the Casa Margarita, they were only $6 at happy hour and they were really good. Not too sweet. My friend and I had the Barrio Poloma (pricier at $15)-Maestro Dobel Reposado, salt, fresh grapefruit, orange and lime juice, and Mexican squirt. They were really good, flavorful and not too strong.  We sat outside on a beautiful day. Enjoyed everything!",

The $3 HH house margarita is solid, although they may try and up-sell you into a \"nicer\" one. If I wasn't there during HH I would have probably listened, but hard to justify the $5 more for a normal one.   One of our tacos got switched out for another one. No biggie, it was delicious anyways, but would have been great to have what I ordered.   Location on the patio is really nice. I don't know if I would ever want to sit inside unless it was summer.",

We have heard stories about the service at the Barrio Queen but let me tell you, our server was very knowledgeable, helpful and attentive... even standing in as a camera director for us! He also makes a mean guacamole!  This definitely is a must. must. try. item. The guacamole is hand-made at your table and by far the most surprising and delicious guac we have had. What makes it so special, the dried cranberries. Yep, you heard us. They are a sweet touch and made this guac a real stand-out. Our only regret was the chips, they are home-made as well, but a bit thick for our taste.  Next up, the tacos. If you love some street tacos, this is definitely the Happy Hour for you. With over 30 tacos listed on a check off sheet (similar to ordering sushi) there is certainly something for everyone here. The tacos are organized by category; chicken & seafood, pork, beef, vegetarian. For Happy Hour Barrio Queen selects two of the tacos and offers them at $3/2 tacos, which changes daily, the remainder of the tacos vary in price from $2.50 - $4.50. Happy Hour runs daily from 2 - 7 pm every day but Monday (they are closed on Monday for the summer months).

Needless to say we were shocked and after waiting15 mins for the hostess to try to clear us a table at 4:30pm we walked out.",

I asked for a spicier salsa than what they brought us waiter said they didn't have anything so he gave  me minced jalepenos (no heat!). I'm glad I asked someone else and they brought me something delicious and fiery! Husband's street tacos were ok (huge, selection though) and definitely on the smaller side (again, compared to what we get in Texas). My Carne Asada entree saved the meal - delicious! Covered in chorizo and served with veggies and black beans. Service was sufficient but confusing. Multiple people came by to take our drink and dinner orders multiple times.",

This ended up being our plan B and apparently, not a great one. My friend spoke very highly of the food here and I was rather excited, considering this was my first night out in the city. We started with a few margaritas which seemed pretty decent and certainly packed quite a punch. We ordered coctel de elotes to start off with and they were alright as well. Again, nothing to write home about. We moved on to the entrees and I decided to get pollo con chorizo and nopalitas tacos. My heart sank when I saw the size of the tacos! They are literally bite sized portions and unfortunately I was unaware that these were not substantial by any means. Flavors were mediocre at best and my chicken taco came without any chorizo... yet another disappointment. I have an obsessive need to order flan at Mexican restaurants and judging by the quality of the rest of the food, I should've known better. Against my better judgement, I ended up getting it anyway and that turned out to be the worst part of the meal. Non existent caramel sauce and the pudding was tough as leather.. what a terrible let down. I had had a couple of pretty strong margaritas by this time, which certainly helped deal with the disappointment. Would I consider returning? Meh.. maybe as plan C.",

    "text": "Barrio Queen, you had me at guacamole made freshly before your eyes at your table side!  A friend and I stopped at Barrio Queen for dinner during a recent trip to Scottsdale as we were craving some Mexican food (when in Rome, right?). We happened to be in the very cute downtown area and walked by this spot with its cool artwork, and figured we may as well give it a shot! And boy am I glad we did.   Right off the bat, service was excellent as we were seated quickly and our server was very personable, attentive, and ready to answer any questions that we had. For starters, we opted for some chips and guacamole and let's just say that decision set the tone for the evening. As previewed above, they make the guacamole fresh before your eyes on a rolling kitchen table type contraption. It was awesome! I love me some guac, and as you may have guessed, their home made version did not disappoint.  For my main course, I opted for three of the freshly prepared tacos that appear to be their calling card to some degree. Specifically, I went with one each of the barrio pollo, salmon con mango, and pescado. All came out wrapped lovingly in fresh, hand pressed corn tortillas. Though the tacos were a bit on the small side, they were all bursting with flavor and packed with fresh ingredients. I would definitely get the tacos again if I ever happen upon this spot, and perhaps be more adventurous and opt for some of the tacos featuring cactus. Before coming in here, I didn't even know cactus tacos were an option!   Drinkwise, they offered a wide array of margaritas (apparently they have a Margarita Monday where margaritas are half off) along with your typical standard Mexican brews and a smattering of wines.   If you find yourself in the downtown Scottsdale area, give Barrio Queen a try!",

There are fabulous paste-ups on the windows of black & white Madres.  Another mural inside has the Dia del Muertas skulls.  Small skulls encusted with sparkle are at the cash register for purchase.

But while it was super tasty it was quite hard to eat with the chips because the carnitas came in huge pieces that hadn't been split or cut up.  Both of us figured if this is an app to be eaten with chips, it should be user friendly...but instead we had to use our forks, cut it up on our plate, and then scoop it up with the chips.  Annoying.  The two of us went for their 3 street taco plates so we could try as many flavors as possible.  I had the carne asada chorizo azul (but was given carne asada...grrrrrrrrr), bario pollo, and pescado.  The bario pollo was my favorite because of the huge poblano pepper at the bottom.  It was quite flavorful while the others were so so.  If you go for the first time, it is totally worth it to try the 3-taco plate and get 3 different types so you can try as much of the flavors as possible...I highly recommend going this route!  Now as for the service, it wasn't so great.  Our waiter was one of the most crankiest and lack luster servers I have ever had.  We even tried joking with him and striking up conversation, but he wasn't having it.  He was also not so good at showing up to refill our water glasses or ask if we needed anything else.  We noticed he was this way with all the tables in our section in front of the bar.  I can't remember his name because I think I tuned it out out of annoyance.",

My husband is a green chile verde connoisseur and he's always impressed with the flavor of the chile verde and quality of the carnitas. When the weather's nice, I love the patio and having a cocktail. Their drinks are always made with fresh juice and agave nectar which makes the 1,000 tequilas they have behind the bar taste even better!  You haven't lived until you've had Cochinita Pibil. Order it. Eat it. Love it! Then come back and order it again!",

    "text": "Definitely worth a try if you are around. I'm torn between a 3 and 4 star review. Here's why:  Good: Torta, guacamole (sort of) Less good: Chips, guacamole  Good torta's are always hard to find and this one was among the best I've had outside of Baja.  Guacamole is made table side and is fresh and flavorful...but we were left with a bowlful of huge chunks of avocado, like basically two big pieces of avo. Had to crush it the rest of the way. No, not a life-ending problem, but just sort of weird.  Chips were flavorless and seemed day-old. Bummer.",

It's located in a square setting in downtown Scottsdale, so we sat outside enjoying the evening scene.   I ordered the carne asada enchiladas and I'm not kidding when I say they were the best enchiladas I've had. I was a little worried with the red sauce, as I'm usually not a fan of red sauce. Totally blew me away. I need to find a way to get these in Vegas. My friends ordered the carne asada burrito and a variety of tacos; needless to say we all walked away completely stuffed.   My only complaint was the lack of service. Our waitress was completely overwhelmed and not able to service us properly. I never got a second beer and it took a couple asks to get chips and salsa. I hope this isn't common there.   Will definitely come back in the future!",

    "text": "First time at Barrio Queen today. Had lunch with the family. Although they were very busy on a Saturday early-afternoon, we were seated quickly.   We all ordered the $10 three-taco special. You can mix and match from 18 different tacos. I ordered a carnitas taco, one al pastor and one carne asada con chorizo azul. Between the four of us we ordered 16 tacos (they are traditionally small) and we got 15 different kinds.   Chips and salsa arrived: both hand made which was a nice touch. The chips were hot, thick and just the right amount of salt. The salsa was thick with a little zip.   Kinda went downhill a bit here. My wife is allergic to onions but the server said \"no problem.\"  My daughter said she didn't want her tacos garnished with extra cilantro, (just a taste preference) and the boys had no changes. My wife's tacos had onions, my daughter's tacos were buried in cilantro and I received a wrong taco.   The server did her best to make good on a bad situation.  She quickly brought hot, new tacos and gave us flan for dessert on the house. Nice remedy but I would have rather had it right the first time.   On to the food:  the carnitas taco was good. Nothing earth shaking but tasty. Very spicy tho. The al pastor: awesome. Tender, sweet, spicy and just the right amount of char on the meat. The carne asada con chorizo azul: epic!  Tender, good char, great seasonings. Bleu cheese on a taco? Genius. I highly recommend the carne asada con chorizo azul. Next time I will probably get two of those and two al pastors and have a siesta later.   Fix the ADHD issue in the kitchen and, Madre, you'll have a winner.",

We got seated at a very small table in a very noisy area. We didn't have enough room on the table for our drinks and chips & salsa so gave back our waters. We were served water by the hostess after about 10 minutes. We were extremely disappointed with our noisy small table and almost walked out. Our server finally took our drink order 15 minutes after we were seated, chips & salsa arrived shortly after. We got drinks in 5 minutes. Server still hadn't taken our order so I proceeded to ask the hostess if we could move to a booth in the bar area. She was very accommodating. When we got seated in the bar we told bar server we wanted to order right away because we had been waiting so long. He took order immediately and food arrived in 10 minutes. We both requested our sauce on the side and when entrees arrived they were exactly as ordered. We had different servers throughout the meal however all were helpful and accommodating. Food was delicious, quantity and presentation were good.  Food and bar drinks were a little pricey however this was Scottsdale. If we returned we would definitely ask to not be seated in the noisy section by the door.",

Highly recommend the tacos (3 for $10), street corn, and table side guacamole.

However, what you can expect is a different take on old classics served in a hipster environment.  I met a colleague here for dinner and I ordered:  Guacamole, $10.75  Vasito de Elote (Grilled Corn, Butter, Mayo, Cotija Cheese, Tapatio Salsa, Cilantro, Lime), $5  Carne Asada Burrito, $15  Margaritas, $6  The Guacamole i served table-side and is very good.  It's rich, so if you're not sharing it, order the half portion.  The Carne Asada Burrito is also very good.  When I asked the server \"What's a specialty here that I must try?\", he said the Vasito de Elote...which is a Grilled Corn appetizer.  I followed his lead and tried it...it's amazing!  A rainbow of flavors explode on your taste buds when you eat it....Sweet, Buttery, Tangy, with a little Spice...yum!  The Margaritas here rock.  Very tasty...I think I put down 5 or 6, I can't remember.  Good thing I wasn't driving.  Overall, it was a very good experience.  It's definitely on my rotation to take clients and colleagues.  The only downside to this place is the parking.  Parking is no bueno, but that's a problem everywhere in Old Town Scottsdale.  Return Factor - 95%",

To start our evening we waited about a half hour as we had thought it would be worth the wait. We were greeted by a hostess that could have cared less to say hello or even wait for us to sit down. Next, our waiter comes and doesn't even ask if it's our first time. He then proceeds to ask if we want drinks and we inquired about the drinks they had, he rolls his eyes and we then said we will just get waters to start. Clearly he had no patience and did not care to walk us through the drink menu. When he came back he asked if I liked margaritas and recommended me to the \"award winning\" margarita and the other two in our party ordered beer. The drinks came and WOW $11 for a watered down margaritas... what a joke. Smallest margarita I have ever had. Could totally understand if it was a house marg but a specialty one for $11 coming in a small glass, you have got to fix that. Rip of for sure. Now this is where things go from worse to even worse. We all ordered three tacos each, not even 3 or 4 minutes later our sub par tacos arrived. Holy buckets, they were cold and soggy. We asked for them to be heated up (server rolled eyes again) then received them back where they were thrown In the microwave (fn gross) like really? You couldn't spend all of two minutes remaking the tacos to make things right. Yet, your server doesn't even ask if it came out better or offer any form of apology for our cold tacos. The chips we received prior to dinner were stale and hard (hurt our teeth) and clearly other reviews agree with that. Save your money and go somewhere that isn't going to rush you through the meal and where they care about the customer satisfaction.",

Entree's:  We had several street taco's, the chop salad, the enchiladas suiza.  We had six different taco's, the best was the Conchita Pibil.  We also had the Carne Asada y huevo which was great, Cameron asado which was ok.  We also had the barrio pollo which was excellent, the pollo deshbrado which was good, and the Saudero Ateca which was also good.  Dessert: We had the churro and buenelos.  Churro was to die for with the carmel and pecans and ice cream!  We went on a Sunday night, it was busy, we were seated quickly, sat in the bar, service was decent, could have been a little more attentive.  I would eat here over and over.  Recommend a reservation!",

I had to ask for chips and salsa, the chips are large clumps of garbage, and the salsa is flavorless much like the rest of their overpriced food, and to think, I walked around hungry for 2 hours before deciding on this less than classy joint. The wait for a table was 1 1/2 hour, couldn't find a seat at the bar for at least an hour. No one has time for that when they're hungry!!  The hosts walk around yelling their reservation names, and if that doesn't make your cringe, they also go out on the sidewalk yelling out their reservation names. But hey, let's get back to the boring food here. Their ice tea tastes like sh**! I think I'm going to be sick.  The plates come with black beans and no rice. I've never been served a plate of Mexican food without refried beans and rice. This place flat out sucks. I'm convinced that there's no such thing as good Mexican food in the Phoenix Metro area. I've lived here for 5 years now and just about every Mexican food place out here SUCKED! I hate this Sonoran garbage. Eating cardboard would be more flavorful than this crap. Can't wait to go back to Texas. This sonoran BS leaves a bad taste in my mouth.",

The restaurant has a nicely shaded patio which was great to be able to sit outside in June! Really enjoyed the guacamole made table side as it had the cranberries that really gave it a twist!  Servicewise?? Beers took forever to get to the table and once delivered, were incorrect. The patio misters were on full blast and by the time we left, the back of my shirt  and my head was soaked with water. I have never blow dried my head at a restaurant before but cant say that now! Several tables made mention of the heavy mist that was to go off at 8p but we were still in a London fog a 815pm.  The chicken burrito was good but I rushed through it so I could leave and dry off. Guess we should have changed tables and moved inside but not all of us were getting the free shower and that was never offered to us.",

I choose to do shots of a reposado. Clase Azul 22. A rich full aroma with a nice smooth mouthfeel that leads to a full body. Slight hints of caramel vanilla and very little alcohol burn. Super satisfying. Produced in Jalisco from the highlands in the heart of Mexico.   My chaser, Victoria beer 5. Copper color with a gentle taste and a smooth, crisp finish. This beer has an authentic history and is a kept secret. Newly arrived to the States maybe no more than a year, this beer has become my favorite Mexican Import.  The staff and I are warming up to each other. Colton and Ron keep me company, they are great. I see Chef Silvana and ask for a moment and introduce myself. Chef Silvana graciously sits with me for a few moments and I begin to learn what I need, to order 5 distinct tacos. I order them one or two at a time.   #1 al pastor, marinated pork with pinapple slice 2.50. #2 arrachera con champinon y huiltiacoche, grilled flank steak with sauteed mushrooms and diced shalot and huitlacoche, the mexican corn truffle, an earthy and somewhat smoky fungus. 4. This was my favorite taco. #3 nopal y chile verde, cactus and pork green chile. 3.  #4 milanesa y salsa cruda, breaded pork with raw chile lime pickled salsa. 3.75 #5 arabe, marinated pork with cucumber salsa on a flour tortilla. 3.50.  I'm ready for Chef Silvana's homemade gourmet pastries made daily. I have a chocolate cookie and a flaky lemon filled roll. 5. both absolutely delicious.  My service was excellent but this is not unusual for me. Pure Mexican ambience and trusted receipes that come from all over the Mexican countryside, it doesn't get any better. Thank you Chef.  Feliz Ano Nuevo, feliz y prospero Ano Nuevo mis amigos y amigas.",

Lime juice is freshly squeezed! I saw them at the bar squeezing it  for my micheladas, which was also good and only $4. Suizas enchilada- $15 The smell of them reminded me of my nanas homemade corn tortillas And the Tomatillo sauce on it was just the right spicy! I will def go again!

Food is over priced, not that great and small portioned (I dont eat huge portions) I got a chicken caesar mexican salad because I was way too temperature hot to eat anything else. The yummiest part of the salad was the grilled chicken.   My friend got a arizona burrito. She said it was alright.   Overall I may have just been too hot but this restuarant wasn't that great.",

My favorite aspect of it is that the menu has a lot of options on it that one might see in a Mexican restaurant in Mexico.  Yes, there are the usual burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and salads - but also other dishes that are common on menus in Mexico and not just the Tex-Mex flair (but don't misunderstand me - I love Tex-Mex, it's just nice to have something different once in a while).    I had the pollo milanesa.  It was the usual breaded boneless chicken breast but added a layer of chorizo to add a spicy element to it.  I quite enjoyed it.  My friend had a salad that she liked.  The portion sizes were generous.  The chips that came before were good and the salsa that was served was tasty.    All in all, a nice treat in Scottsdale!",

(The pescado was the only dud I found; that's mostly my fault because I don't love fried food.)  I've also had the Cochinita Pibil torta and the half order of the guacamole... both amazing.  It tends to be on the expensive side so I opt for Taco Tuesday where you can stuff yourself full of tacos, chips and salsa, beer, and margaritas for less than $20.",

That said, we tried Barrio Cafe at the airport and had a rockin' meal with great, albeit slightly wack, service.  Quality control folks or maybe the Scottsdale crowd just doesn't know the difference :)...",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here for dinner after being told there would be over an hour wait for Culinary Dropout (sad face). We'd always been curious about this restaurant-apparently it had won some sort of \"Best of 2012\" award-Although I was a bit apprehensive that it only has 3 stars on Yelp. Everything's subjective I suppose.   We had to wait a bit here as well, although not nearly as long. I was super excited to see salsa dancers and a band performing in the outdoor dining area. We ended up being sat at the table right next to where the band was playing. I was a bit worried about that...I imagined having to shout my conversation or order to our server...thankfully the band wasn't obnoxiously loud.  Our server was super friendly and helpful. I ordered the red sangria and my boyfriend ordered the margarita. The sangria was very delicious, however the margarita was so-so. Not the best I've ever had, although I don't normally drink margaritas.   We both ordered the tacos. I don't know what I ever expect to receive when I go to a nicer restaurant and order tacos. I looked at the menu and thought \"Wow, that's some really inexpensive tacos! What a deal! 3 should be good for a meal!\" I also thought the same thing when I went to Distrito (except they were pricier there). Well..the tacos we ordered were the tiny street tacos. Boo. And 3 was hardly enough for a meal! Ha. That's not a knock on them, it's my own ignorance for not ordering 6 as a meal, like the menu suggested. There just wasn't many fish or vegetarian items to choose from on the menu, which was surprising to me-I just didn't want to settle for a quesadilla! I ended up getting 3 different kinds of tacos: Salmon y Mango, Pescado, and the Nopalitos (just because I was curious to figure out what the heck cactus tastes like).  I can't quite recall what my boyfriend ordered..at least one was Carnitas. Our tacos came relatively quickly! I was really surprised considering how busy it was. They were really tasty. I enjoyed the Pescado one the most, however the cactus taco was quite an interesting experience. Not bad, just not my cup of tea. We also received salsa for our tacos, but both the green and red salsas were much too thin for my taste. Afterwards, we were still hungry so we ordered chips and salsa. The salsa that came with the chips was miles better!   Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience. The atmosphere with the decor and live music was very enjoyable and our server was extremely friendly. The food was decent. I would probably go back another time just because the service was quite good.",

    "text": "I truly anticipated that Barrio Queen would become one of my favorite restaurants upon walking in. Awesome decor and concept with the taco menu resembling a sushi menu where you mark off which you'd like to try. Then we met the waitress & it all went downhill from there... Just the thought of this place makes me sick now!  I ordered a martini & after tasting it, my entire table of avid tequila drinkers decided that there was tequila in it. No big deal, we'll just order another one, right?! Wrong. The waitress was so rude and sarcastic stating that there was NO tequila in it, in fact she made it herself. Okay?   Ordered a round of tacos, they were fine. Nothing inspiring. Ordered tableside guac, they didn't make it tableside for us but they did for a nearby table. Chips WAY too greasy. We were still hungry so we ordered chicken enchiladas. They were cold, disgusting, and here's the kicker... I found a long dark hair right in the middle... VOM! We were clearly done at that point, and when we politely showed the waitress the hair she says, \"That's so weird, I don't think there's anyone who even works here with long dark hair...\" Hahahahaha! At a mexican restaurant?! *Cue 5 different employees walking by our table with long dark hair before we leave* Laughable. She didn't apologize or comp anything for us. Had she done that, I might have tried Barrio Queen again and given it a second chance but since the service was so incredibly poor and the food totally subpar I won't ever waste my time again! If you want amazing mexican food try La Hacienda at The Princess or The Mission.",

That's pretty much where the good parts end.   The menu is confusing, and while the waitress was nice, there was an attitude of annoyance while she explained the menu. The service was a bit slow, and the $10 chips and guacamole (salsa comes in two very tiny little portions on the side) lasted about 3 minutes. The tacos were billed as street style. My dad and I each ordered three. They were customizable, but very basic and bland. It's literally a raw tortilla and some kinda warm meat. We left feeling hungry :(  On a side note- if you are bringing children- I hope they aren't picky eaters. I think they had three items for kids, and no beans. My daughter barely ate her quesadilla, and mostly ate chips.   Over all it was kind of a bummer. It's not awful, just not good. It's also pricey. $120 for four adults who left hungry.",

    "text": "First, I love Cafe Barrio.  The experience has always been top notch.  Unfortunately Barrio Queen completely missed the mark.  I didn't want to like it, I wanted to love it!  Wet arrived about 7 last Friday night.  My partner was very excited because he loves CB.  I liked the interior, it was fun, playful and half-hazzard like CB.  Mike didn't like it, he thought they were trying to hard.  Our friends from Denver liked the interior well enough.  The experience... the waiters, servers, staff all looked busy, looked is the operative word.  The restaurant was less than half full and the staff looked harried and rushed.  When we got to our seats on the patio we all thought what a great night, beautiful weather, fun exciting place and we know the food is good at CB so it should be great here.  We playfully talked to our waiter... which I guess was the wrong thing to do.  Our friends love to laugh and flirt and push boundaries, our waiter was short, abrupt and acted offended.  I reminded him that he was working for tips, then he conveniently remembered he is/was in the service industry.  We had to ask for water repeatedly, and finally our waiter said \"I told the buss boy to get you water...\"   Unfortunately this sums up the waiter experience.  The bus boys were standing at the end of the bar talking... all night... which explains why we waited for thirty minutes to get water.  We ordered the choriqueso and the guacamole for appetizers.  When it came out the choriqueso was a monster bowl of cheese with some spicy sausage which was tasty if a bit overwhelmingly large.  The guacamole was surprising, it came in a very small bowl.  Usually at CB they come to the table and make the guac table side with flourish and panache.  Then I noticed that two tables were there the quac was being made table side... I looked at the tables to see what the difference was and it was glaringly obvious.  Not one of the four of us had boobs.  Then I looked at all of the staff, excluding the two women at the front desk who were wonderful by the way everyone else was male.  The servers went out of their way to make the quac for the tables with ladies but the tables with men we got a quarter order of guac made in the kitchen... reverse discrimination or homophobia... either option sucks.  Unfortunately it didn't stop with the guac...  For dinner Mike ordered the enchiladas de pollo.  I ordered off the \"sushi\" taco sheet the cochnita pibil tacos (great idea, love the concept). Our friends from Denver split the 16 de septiembre chiles rellenos.  Mike was disappointed by his enchiladas, they were not very flavorful and the plate looked like a Chopped Chef threw everything on the plate just to be done in time.  My tacos were as expected, similar to CB good flavor but the same IronChopped Chef ran out of time on my plate.  The chiles rellenos were the highlight, the chef took time to make sure it looked great.  The boys from Denver loved it.  Dessert... the same chef who ran out of time plating Mike's and my plates also ran out of time and I think some ingredients for the churros.  At CB they finish the plate with some ice-cream which (I know it sounds funny) cuts the sweetness of the caramel.  It was sorely missed.    Unfortunately when we left Mike and I said to each other that the food and the experience was not worth the drive or money (we live by the Biltmore) and if we wanted the food CB was a better bet.  It is a shame really, it is a great space, in a really nice area but it misses the mark by quite a bit.  Our bill was just over 120 for the four of us.  Yes I had two margaritas which were good but 120 plus tip?  Two apps, three entrees and two desserts... 120 plus tip for Mexican food?  CB is worth it BQ... not so much.    I truly hope they can get the staff trained to be as professional and friendly as CB to all patrons not just those with boobs.  Yes, Phoenix is more diverse than Scottsdale but great service should extend to all patrons regardless of mammary  glands.  I also hope they can get the kitchen staff to take time, slow down and make the food look great (especially when the restaurant is only half full).  The flavors are mostly there, the plating enhances the experience and visually adds to the food.",

    "text": "Oh, have I tried so hard to like Barrio Queen, more than once, with the same poor outcome...  I went here for my birthday, and I'll try to keep it shorter than my 3 hour wait, even though I was told it would only be a 30 minute wait, an hour at the longest, and people were sat before me that had arrived after me. But they apologized...finally....and did make it up to my party and myself and thankfully the food was good. However, they made an impression and it was bad, but I tried to overlook their obvious lack of service, gave them the benefit of the doubt, good food will always win me over.  So, I considered this experience a fluke (very nice of me...) and I decided to go again on a slow Tuesday and give them a new chance. I ordered a margarita with no salt, what did I get? Salt...and mind you, we were at a booth next to the bar, and our server was the bartender and it was slow. I proceeded to order items, which I had ordered before, that were actually good the first time. Imagine my surprise, when the food I received looked like someone had just thrown random items on the plate with guacamole that was already turning brown as compared to when it came neatly presented to me and looking so tasty and fresh the first time. I inquired: had plating changed? Was there a problem with their avocados, produce, etc? The server said no, I pointed to the obviously wilted and browning ingredients- I was getting frustrated. I continued through the remaining sloppy dishes, while the manager decided to sit at the booth next to us and chitchat apparently with some business buddies. Who's commentary of every girl that walked by was extremely distasteful instead of keeping an eye on the kitchen and watching quality control. I was not asked for a second drink until the meal was finished, our water was never refreshed even though our glasses went empty halfway during the meal, and obviously not asked how our meal was/went. I tried, I really did...but lack of customer service and inconsistent food quality will have me avoiding this place even if I was starving and desperate.",

Lots of flavor and interesting ingredients.  And the margaritas are out of this world.",

This is a casual place with authentic homemade food, so you have to respect that things will take time. They have an outstanding tequila selection and the food was delicious. We had choriqueso for an appetizer- large portion, great for sharing, fresh chips and guacamole, one taco each ( street size, a la cart) and churros for dessert. We tried a couple of their margaritas- absolutely delicious!!!  It was great to see the Chef talking to every table and listening to customer feedback about the food. She mentioned that the menu is a bit overwhelming to those who are not familiar with the fare. I agree, but the descriptions of each item were perfect and the servers were very knowledgeable. it is truly a unique experience to dine at a place like this.  I would like to try their happy hour so I can taste more items.",

    "text": "Went to Barrio Queen for lunch today.  I live in Chandler and was meeting a friend from Cave Creek so we wanted to meet somewhere in the middle.  I got a lot of recommendations to try this place and read the reviews on Yelp.  It sounded great!  Parking was easy... it was a Saturday afternoon but the underground garage had plenty of spaces and it's free.  We had to wait about 15 minutes for a table to sit outside.  It is unseasonably warm right now and unfortunately our table had a lot of sun so it was kind of hot!  But, it was a nice patio and I liked the overall feel of the place.  Our server took our drink order and I think she brought me a Coke Zero instead of Diet Coke.  After she came back I told her I didn't think it was a Diet Coke so she brought me a new drink which was correct...however it took a while for her to come back with it.  The food was ok.  A little pricier than I would have liked for what you actually get but I guess that's Scottsdale.  I had the Carne Asada torta that came with fries.  The fries were steak fry style (which I am not a fan of) and they had some kind of seasoning on them that I didn't care for.  The sandwich was actually very good but nothing I would go back for.  My friend had a salad -Aguacate Tomato Mango.  It was more like a plate of wedges of Avocado, Tomato, and mango...no lettuce or anything.  It looked good if you are into that but it wouldn't have been enough of a satisfying meal for me.  My bill with tip came to just under $20 and in my opinion, that was more than I thought it was worth.  It wasn't horrible and I would give it 2 1/2 stars but Yelp doesn't let you...so \"Meh, I've experienced better\" would perfectly sum it up.  I think I would have given it a better review if we sat in the shaded part of the patio and if I had ordered the 3 tacos for $10 plate...the tacos are supposed to be good.",

    "text": "After hearing great things about this place for several years my wife and I decided to try it for lunch.  First of all, it is much smaller than I had imagined.  As you enter there is a bar to the left with 5-6 stools and 3 booths.  To the right there are maybe 12-15 tables and a couple of booths and several high top tables in front of another bar.  It was too hot for us to consider eating outside but there looked to be maybe 8-10 tables on a patio.  The place is decorated in very kitschy Mexican, with lots of paintings of death masked people on the walls, etc.  The first thing we noticed was the enervating noise level.  It was so loud what with the music blaring, metal carts being rolled around, and other background noise we could barely hear each other across the table.  The acoustics are none existent.  The tables are right on top of one another, so there is no element of intimacy and you hear every word of what your dining neighbors are saying.  Unfortunately, we had a loud laughing guy right next to us who obnoxiously guffawed at everything his table mates said.  The extremely narrow tables are all set up so there is a chair on the outside and the inside seating is a continuous booth.  The tables are so close we had to slide ours to the side to let patrons at the adjoining table in and out and even then one old lady's big butt slammed into me so hard I thought she was falling on me.  Delightful way to start a meal.  The menu seemed interesting with a wide selection.  We passed on appetizers and my wife ordered the bacon wrapped hot dog while I ordered the Californian enchilada.  It is cheese filled for $10 but shrimp could be added for an extra $4.00.  I opted for the additional shrimp.  My mistake for not specifically asking how the shrimp was served.  When my plate arrived there were the three enchiladas with three small shrimp casually tossed on top of them.  Poor me, I had just assumed the shrimp would be placed INSIDE the enchiladas, chopped up and mixed with the cheese, as I've always had them before, not just adorning the top of the enchiladas.  $1.25 per shrimp seems a little pricey, even for Old Town Scottsdale.  Oh well, one is never too old to learn to ask specific questions.  The enchiladas were good, but nothing special; I'd rate them a 2 out of 5.  I've had much better at other Mexican restaurants.  My wife really liked her hot dog, which is a funny thing to have on a Mexican restaurant to begin with but she liked it.  As our meal was served I asked our waitress how much the chips and salsa cost, as we had not looked carefully at the appetizer section of the menu but had noticed the tables around as all had them.  She stated that there was no charge, but you had to ask for them to get them.  Oh, never had that happen before. Over all, I don't get the positive reviews and all the hype about this place.  This is obviously a trendy Scottsdale place du jour, but I wouldn't recommend you waste your time or money here.  BTW, service was good, water and tea glasses filled frequently and a nice waitress.  If you know anything about quality Mexican food there are dozens of better locations in and around Phoenix.  Don't jump on the bandwagon and go here.  I think its more for tourists who mostly experience Mexican food at Taco Bell.",

    "text": "I have eaten at Barrio Cafe in Phoenix, which I like but I love Barrio Queen. This place is amazing, if you are looking for a nice blend of creative dishes with a hint of authenticity, this place is it.  The place is very nice, great location, I suggest reservations if you are going on a weekend night as it gets busy.  They are very accommodating to large parties, the most we have had is 6 but I have seen larger parties of 10 or more.  Guacamole is great! Made at your table, with figs and pomegranate, a creative take on guacamole. I have the tacos, pollo tacos are awesome.  Perfectly marinated.  My husband prefers their menudo (only served on weekends) or shrimp tacos.  We ask for the same server every time, Miguel, he is AWESOME.  Very friendly and attentive wait staff, considering how busy the place gets but given reviews about service, we like to stick to who we know.  Miguel knows us on a first name basis and knows what foods we like, he makes it a point to make recommendations based on our likes and dislikes.  Which goes a long way in our book!  They have a new manager, which I had never met the prior manager but the new manager made it a point to introduce himself to every table and check on everyone.  We sit, enjoy a chelada and eat food, surrounded by friendly people, can't beat that! Again, you have to have an \"open\" pallet, it is not your run of the mill \"authentic\" Mexican food. It is an original interpretation of Mexican dishes.  I have seen some mentions about no salsa, there is salsa, homemade roasted chili salsa, it's good and I have had it served with my chips.  Also, the statements about no sides, such as beans or rice with your tacos, that is correct, there are no sides.  That has not bothered me, I can order 3 tacos and feel fed and full , but if your someone who needs to feed an empty pit, 3 street tacos are probably not going to do it for you.  I have taken my sister and her husband to dinner, my sister loved it, her husband had a torta and did not care for it but admitted it was a bit \"too creative\" for him.  If you want authentic, homemade, simple ingredients Mexican, I recommend Casa Reynoso in Tempe. P.S. their (Barrio) margaritas are darn near perfect! They also serve Victoria on tap, which I don't see too often.",

It was clear that the restaurant wasn't that busy because of all the empty tables but she told me and my husband \"It's going to be an hour wait so I'm not sure if you want to wait\". One way or another I WAS going to eat so I happily said \"That's ok we will wait :) \" 20 min later we get seated. What an hour that was! But on to the food!! We ordered the Queso Fundido. Not so great. Chorizo, mushrooms and peppers are delicious but the cheese was so thick that we couldn't even dip the chips in to scoop them out. We also ordered 3 tacos each. Pescado asado, El pastor and carne asada with chorizo. All delicious, especially the unique in house made tortillas. El pastor was complimented well with the pineapple, might be too dull without it and the carne asada/chorizo was a little dry but the salsa helps. Also they were alot smaller then i thought. Overall it was an ok place.",

    "text": "Tried Barrio Queen on Wednesday. I have very much been looking to a new location from this chef and to see lights on again in the space formerly occupied by my beloved Metro Brassiere. I am not a tequila drinker (yes, lame, I know) and the only options on the menu were margaritas and beer. I asked the waiter if there was anything else and he recommended a cosmo. It was $15, which I think is a little steep, but it featured Grey Goose and was amazing, not too strong, not too tart or sweet. Definitely a pleasant surprise for a Mexican restaurant. My friend and I split the guacamole, which seems to be the same pomegranate seed-speckled variety as featured at Barrio Cafe, and just as delicious. We did the combo option, which allows you to pick from a list of 6-8 entrees and comes with black beans and a cabbage slaw. The beans were mostly pureed/mashed - the flavor was great but I would have liked a little more texture. The slaw was also a little bland, but the cochinita pibil and chile verde were awesome. The cochinita pibil is, again, the same or similar to the recipe served at Barrio Cafe and is my favorite item there. The chile verde had some good spicy kick to it, but not so spicy that it overwhelmed the flavors. They played awesome varied Mexican music in the background, the servers were attentive and friendly, and the sparkly bronze-colored seats, big jars of aguas frescas and other decorative touches make for an attractive comfortable setting.   The waiter carefully packaged our leftovers, and I made huevos rancheros with my leftover beans, cochinita pibil and chile verde. If it's possible, they actually tasted better after a day or two. I will definitely be back.",

Was feeling frisky and ordered a couple of their top of the line margaritas, not sure what I was thinking ($15 ea!) but boy were they good. Had some sort of \"special\" where the drinks came with a couple of souvenir shot glasses (as-if I need them but guess it was to make one feel better about the price of the drink!) When we split a third margarita later, had to negotiate for another shot glass. Sheesh.  Asked for some chips and no free chips. that always irks me (especially after having just ordered a couple of overpriced drinks). So ordered chips along with the house salsa, sort of interesting flavor but very watery to the extent that it wouldn't even stay on the chips - the chips we had to purchase. Disappointing. Went ahead and also ordered their guacamole (advertised as \"made table-side\" - but it's not). Very very good. Not the typical mashed style - huge chunks of avocado. If you're an avocado and onion fan, you'll love the guac.  I ordered the Barrio Pollo burrito, very tasty. My Sweetie ordered tacos, don't remember which but she enjoyed them.  Overall, we agreed the food was good, but overpriced ('course, it's located in Old Town $cottsdale so I guess that's the norm).   Wouldn't go out of our way, but if in the immediate area might come back.",

That should've been a cue to get up and leave, but we decided to give it a go.  My hubby had the chicken enchilada with chili verde sauce.   Nothing worth noting, but he said it was good.  My little cutie pie had 2 shrimp tacos.  Mind you, each taco had ONE little battered shrimp in there for $4.75.  Flopping the hard corn tortillas about, he didn't feel that he was playing with his food because it was inedible.  So, for two pieces of medium sized beer battered shrimp came to $9.50!   I was in the mood for a big bowl of menudo and taco al pastor.  The marinated pork was delicious.  I should've had a couple of that instead.  The menudo already had the red chile in it and chock full of tripe and hominy.  Hubby and son just glanced over to make a weird face at me right before I put a spoonfull in my mouth.  The good comforting flavor was there and so was a whole cup of salt.  I squeezed more lime in it to see if it will lessen the sea water.    Our server came and I told her that I just can't eat the menudo.  She looks at the bowl with her hands around it and asks \"What did you want me to do with it?\"  She just gave me an attitude like it was my fault it was salty.  \"Well, if you squeezed lime in there, it brings out more of the saltiness.\"  What kind of bullshit was that?  I told her to send it back because it will give me high blood pressure!  In place of that horrible soup, I got the arrachera taco which dried my toungue up even more.    I don't think I can give this place another chance.  I will, however, try Barrio Cafe someday.  It will surely be a better experince than this one.",

That's after you've waited and waited for one of the empty tables. Then there is the completely incompetent, rude and totally unprofessional staff to round out your miserable dinner.",

The heat of the peppers sneak up on you but the flavor was fantastic. Only thing keeping it from a 5 is the tortillas are tiny so they can be difficult to eat.   Their Barrio Pollo Burrito is the best chicken burrito I have ever had. 6 of 5. That sauce is incredible. HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT.   Finished with the tres leches. It was more fruit and whipped cream than tres leches. The bites of cake I had were tasty but skimped for their strawberry counterpart. 2/5.   While the food came out reasonably quick, the service is at a more relaxed pace. That being said, I always had drink in my glass and my waiter made great recommendations and was very attentive. 4 staff members asked how things were and quickly rushed away plates. It was a pleasant dining experience.",

    "text": "I personally loved this place. Since we are in the Scottsdale area for a conference I wanted to try something authentic and native to the area. I'm so happy we chose this place. I had the 3 tacos for $10.50-ish. They were tiny but still so full of their delicious toppings and filled me up just fine along with the chips and salsa. They had a huge variety of taco flavors. I had the Cochinita Pabil (which they're supposed to be famous for), the Barrio Chorizo Pollo and the Carne Asada tacos. Loved each one of them for their unique, awesome flavor. I'm a huge fan of chorizo.  My friends all got different things on the menu and were pretty pleased with their choices. I tried the menudo. It had good flavor. Was a little spicy, but otherwise good.  The entrees are a little more pricy (around 20 bucks a plate) but there is plenty on the menu you can find for 12 bucks or under.  My only gripe with the place in general is that there was no unlimited chips and salsa. Only the first serving is complementary for the table. We were a little bummed by this, especially since the salsa was fantastic in my opinion.  Overall, great place. Loved it. Would love to come back if every in the Scottsdale area!",

It took a good 15 minutes before a waitress even acknowledged my party. Then another HOUR for our food. There was only four of us and the restaurant was not packed. How long could it  possibly take to make a couple of burritos and carnitas? After the hour long wait, two of the plates of food came out cold.   My carnitas were delicious the second time they came out and were hot, but it was hard to enjoy my experience with such lackluster service. I will commend them, we complained and of course got the complimentary dessert.   **Side note** The guacamole is over priced. I paid $10 to have an avocado poorly mashed up with a spoon and a few other ingredients mixed in. For $10 I expect more effort and MORE GUAC. Such a rip off.   The food isn't even authentic.",

    "text": "My fiance and I have been there a handful of times for lunch, brunch, dinner and drinks.  I have read some of the other reviews and frankly, I am surprised by the non-5 star rankings because Barrio Queen is one of the few places in Phoenix I will drive across town for.  I love to bring my friends and family to Barrio Queen.  Meal:  They just recently changed their menu but their taco options have practically stayed the same.  I almost exclusively get tacos and one of the draft beers . . . especially the Breckenridge Agave Wheat.  Margaritas are also a sure bet too.  Taste:   Perfect, perfect, perfect.  Too many \"fancy taco\" places through out the valley think the more crap they throw on the taco, the better it taste but in reality, it just falls short.  Barrio Queen seems to know exactly the point where if they left something out, it wouldn't be enough and if they added one more spice or thing, it would be too much.  The other thing they do well is taking authentic Mexican food and adding a modern/contemporary twist.  A lot of places try to do just that but what ends up really happening is a dish that lacks any sort of real identity or cohesiveness.  10 out of 10.  Value:  When it comes to the entrees, portion sizes are great.  Tacos, however, are slightly over priced. . . but they always have some sort of special going on with their tacos. They have great happy hour deals and I never leave hungry from this place.  4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness: Service at Barrio Queen is excellent, especially for Scottsdale.  Most servers and bartenders in Scottsdale seem to be \"too-cool-for school-pissed-off\" 20-something year olds, but the team at Barrio Queen is incredibly friendly.  They aren't afraid either to make recommendations and is very attentive.  9 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  The architecture and music work well for the type of vibe they are going for.  I used to live in Brownsville, TX, which is on the border with Matamoros, Mexico . . . and the music reminds me so much of living in the Rio Grande Valley.  4 out of 5.  Overall:  If I was wanting to try a new place prior to hitting up the bars in Old Town or looking for a new place for Sunday brunch, I highly recommend Barrio Queen.  And whenever I bring friends or family from out of town to Barrio Queen, they absolutely love it.  I would recommend parking in the parking garage just behind/below because on street parking is a pain!  27 points out of 30, 5 out of 5 stars.",

The restaurant was pretty crowded but there was no trouble with seating our party of 8 on the fly. First thing on the table was chips and salsa. Chips were really hard and crunchy, salsa was mild with a slight bite. Yum. The menu has really nice selections. More of a contemporary mexican vibe. We started with the nachos chingones. Good but not over the top. For my meal, I chose the enchilada   suizas- pulled chicken enchiladas, garnished with chorizo and a green jalapeno tomatillo sauce. It was delicious with a really nice bite. MAY be too spicy for some but I like heat in my food. There were 8 in our party, 3 ordered the same dish, one ordered carne asada enchiladas, 3 went with a mix and match of tacos and one had a beautiful and interesting dish named chiles en nogada- a pepper stuffed with chicken, apples, raisins, pomegranate seeds and more. Overall, I really liked this place. It's  been on my local restaurant bucket list for a while now. I would go back.",

From the incredible breadth of taco options to the drink menu, this place has quality food and a great atmosphere. It's a tad expensive, but worth it.   Our group started out with some table side guacamole as well as chips and queso. The guac is pretty unique-  it came with dried cranberries in it.  I definitely recommend it, but the portion is a little small for a large group, so maybe order 2! You won't regret it. The queso came with chorizo on top, and I am a vegetarian, but the other members of my party thoroughly enjoyed it! We ordered two pitchers of sangria- 1 red and 1 white.  Both options are phenomenal, and come in a glass with a sugar salt rim....such a delicious touch.    We loved our server, she was kind and offered great advice on ordering! I highly recommend the restaurant; it is fantastic.",

Especially refreshing during the hotter season. The plates alone are not very spicy but you can request chiles tatemados to help spice up your meal as well as extra salsa verde which is on point. This location offers a pleasing atmosphere. The waiters are amazing! Very friendly as well as maintain a great communication between different staff to make sure we received all requests quickly rather than having our main waiter take care of everything.

    "text": "I love Barrio Queen's happy hour.  It starts at TWO!! and lasts 4 hours, AND is offered on weekends!! Admittedly, I have only really eaten off the happy hour or apps menu. But when in rome, why stray from the tacos? They're PERFECT! At 3 for $10, I almost always order two fish tacos and one shrimp. The beer battered fish is so delicious and tasty and so perfect to enjoy with thier margaritas. Despite other reviews, I argue that three are plenty to fill you up if you are looking to spend $10 on tacos, it is exactly what you should expect.  The tableside guacamole is a bit of an unnecessary presentation, but the end result is all we care about right? And Barrio Queen delivers on its guac! The pork dip appetizer is also very tasty, but a little too much fat for my tastes. I'm not a superfan of pork.   Regarding the service --- be nice, and they'll be nice back.  You can tell some of these folks have been around the block and are not a fan of catering to Scottsdale's elitist jerks.  But when you are friendly, smile-y, and honest -- you can be promised excellent service with a smile.   The ambience -- sit outside, just do it!! It is beautiful out there, there is usually live music playing nearby on the Cowboy Ciao corner or right at the canal.  Its just great to people watch and be watched by those who wish it was thier own taco time. Bring a coat in winter, and you'll still be happy. I've waited twenty minutes at the bar just to be able to dine outside. This is one of my favorite patios in old town.  Crowd is a total mixed vibe. Partiers still awake from last night right next to the snowbirds from Michigan, alongside a few baseball players and trophy wives. I've been fortunate that for the handful of times I've been here, I've never once seen any children of the annoying age group that make your meal distracting and keep your voice hushed.  I have no idea why Barrio Queen has ever been rated with less than 4 stars. Yes, I'm fairly easy to please when there is great outdoor seating and guacamole, but still - I think all around it is a great spot to check out and spend a few hours drinking house margs and munching on some tacos. :-)",

Their tableside guacamole is some of the best we have had. It is a little pricey, but my experience has been that you usually pay more when it is prepared tableside. My husband ordered the Barrio Pollo Con Chorizo tacos which he thought were excellent, and I ordered the Pork Chile Verde Y Rajas tacos. The menu description of the Pork Chili Verde tacos says slow cooked tender pork, poblano peppers and green tomatillo sauce. Topped with cabbage, diced red onions and fresh cilantro. They sounded perfect and, in fact, were very good EXCEPT they were incredibly SPICY! Poblano peppers are generally mild. I am guessing that jalapeno peppers were used by mistake as my mouth and throat were burning! The pork was amazing. The place was very lively and loud. A bit too much so for us. We were seated indoors. We would go back, but try to pick a quieter day and time if possible (we were there on a Thursday around 5:45 p.m.) and would try to eat outdoors the next time.",

I got seated immediately outside (low 60s was warm for me in December), and had a very friendly server who helped with some suggestions.  I went with a variety of three tacos - Cochinita Pibil, Camaron, and Carne Asada y Huevo.  All were very tasty, and the homemade chips & salsa were good too.  Of course I needed to wash it down with margarita, and that was excellent as well!  I definitely recommend!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that Barrio Queen is my favorite restaurant and that I dine at the Scottsdale location usually once a week - sometimes more - and have been going for several years.  I love the up-beat, yet relaxing environment with a great patio space and am addicted to the chips, margaritas, tacos, nachos, and more.  I always request a table outdoors as even in the summer, the charming Barrio exterior atmosphere is worth the heat and food has never let me down.    Despite my love of this restaurant's atmosphere and tasty treats, I feel compelled to give it 3 stars at best due to my constant frustrations with the seating and service.  Almost every time I go to this restaurant, I know I'm in for a 30-45 minute wait for a table (regardless of whether I show up at 5:15, 6:30, or after 7 p.m.).  This wouldn't be a problem for me if the restaurant were legitimately full and servicing other customers or if the restaurant took reservations.  However, there are almost always at least 10-15 tables that are visibly empty when I arrive and there have been multiple occasions where I've waited a full 45 minutes only to be seated at a table that remained empty throughout the whole duration of my wait.  There seems to be a consistent and devastating glitch with their table-turning to the extent that I'm sure they're scaring away dozens of customers with long waits when they have open tables.   When I finally do manage to get seated, the table service has proven to be inconsistent.  There have been months where many visits in a row, I've had attentive waiters that promptly bring water and chips and salsa.  However, there have also been many visits where I've waited at my table without any staff acknowledgement for over 15 minutes and finally had to get someone's attention.  The point is, you never know what kind of table service you're going to get - I'd say it's a 50/50 chance of good vs. terrible and ultimately wonder if changes in management may have something to do with the inconsistency.   The kitchen on the other hand is always up to par - the food comes very promptly after you order it and is extremely consistent.  I've probably ordered the same dishes around 100 times and never had a disappointment.    In short, I will keep coming back to this restaurant because I love the food, but the inefficient and inconsistent customer service is a major frustration to me and a serious limiting factor for this restaurant.  I would say check it out, but be prepared to wait for no good reason.",

Sadly, the smoked salmon taco is no longer. In its place I revisited the cochinita pibil, which was probably the best of the bunch. The carne asada with a fried egg was excellent.  I enjoyed the huitlacoche but I wonder if it's violating some culinary guideline to combine something mushroom-esque with actual mushrooms. The grilled shrimp was great - sort of a lighter version of blackened - but disappointing in its quantity (one.)  Overall, Barrio Queen continues to excel at the basics while developing intriguing juxtapositions.",

Even the chips and salsa were top notch, which were complimentary. Our server Erik had great recommendations, which we took all of them. I had the Chiles En Nogada. After my first bite, I was already ready to give this restaurant 5 stars. It was a roasted poblano pepper filled with chicken, apples, pears, dried apricots, golden raisins, walnuts, onions and garlic. Covered in an almond cream sauce, cilantro, queso fresco, and pomegranate seeds. It was served with a side of chipotle mashed potatoes and veggies. The entree was $22 but well worth it! They have tequila on a 50% off special daily from 2-6pm. I ordered one and the server suggested getting it \"sangrita\" style, which meant it came with 2 chasers to sip along w/the tequila. One was a house-made Bloody Mary mix, the other was a pineapple/jalapeno/ cilantro house-made mix. It added to the already amazing experience. I can't wait to go back!",

You see, I love me a good taco, and with over 60 to choose from I was very pumped.  However, Barrio Queen just fell a little flat for us. We ordered the cochinita, the carnitas, milanesa reggie and chorizo y pollo. Of the 4, the chorizo y pollo was the best. The cochinita, while good, didn't quite hit it out of the park for me (I LOVE cochinita) the carnitas was super dry, the milanesa, which is breaded and crunchy, was also dry and lacking overall flavor. Good, but not great and not what I had hoped for.  Then we ordered the green chile beef and the tlacoyos. If you're unfamiliar with tlacoyos they are....well.....similar to arepas? Not really sure how to describe them but they are generally awesome and while these were OK it, again, wasn't what I was hoping for. Very little chicken with the dish and the tlacoyo's themselves (the little cakey/tortilla type thing on the bottom) wasn't substantial enough. But how was the green chile beef you ask? Salty. Very, very, salty.   $37 bucks in all before tip just added to the disapointment. I really hope this place does well, and I do plan on coming back to try more of the tacos but overall...disapointed.",

    "text": "In a Gist: This is truly a \"meh\" experience. The food is average given the price range. The ambiance and service are also not features to scream about either. Given the fact that Barrio Queen does not take reservations, nor does it call you when your name is up on their wait-list, this is simply not worth it in my mind.   Accessibility: Drive and park. I was in Scottsdale for one night so I don't know what public transit/walking to this place is like.   Ambiance: Meh. It's really nondescript. They have a pseudo industrial feel going on with bottles of tequila in metal framing throughout the restaurant but that doesn't really do it for me.   Service: Meh again. They were more or less on top of their game but my water did not get as much attention as I'd like. If I were to lump together putting our name on the waitlist, going to another bar, returning 45 minutes later (we were told it was a 45 minute wait) and finding that we had to wait another 20 minutes because our name was called and we weren't there, then this would be downgraded to a \"nope\". I realize they expect us to sit there (and perhaps spend money at their bar which had not room for us to stand at) but most places call you (as in phone call) when your name is up.  Food:   I had three tacos for ten dollars. As others have mentioned, these are small tacos. I'm talking about two normal sized bites per taco. Unless you're only slightly peckish, three is not enough. The tacos are also unremarkable. Edible, acceptable but nothing special. Since I was still a bit hungry after my three tacos, I ordered the flan for dessert. Also meh. Perhaps I'm holding it to too high of a standard (my last flan before the one I had here was absolutely superb). Worth the 6 dollars I paid? Maybe. Maybe not.  Overall Assessment: It should be fairly obvious from my review. This place is the epitome of \"meh\". Nothing exceptional. A general let down and waste of time. I regret not having stayed at Second Story Liquor Bar where we had drinks while waiting for our dinner as well. The food and menu looked much better than the Barrio Queen (I know it's not the same style but this isn't going to quench any desperate Mexican food urges).",

The burrito my husband ordered was seriously amazing--some kind of pulled pork that had fresh flavor and delicious sauce.   However, our service was seriously lacking. We waited forever for everything, and she forgot out $11 table-side made guacamole. She wasn't around, so we had to ask a server at a nearby table where it was, and when she finally came to make it, she just kind of rushed through it and slammed it on the table. We asked for moderate spice and the guac was totally flavorless. The ingredients were of good quality, and I actually thought the addition of pomegranate would have been nice if we weren't essentially given a flavorless bowl of avacado hunks.  I ordered the fried shrimp tacos, which were completely average. I ate one of the three and gave the rest to my husband.    I should have known better than to order dessert, but I did it anyway--mostly because I was still hungry from not eating my tacos. I ordered churros, and it took half an hour to get one. freaking. churro. The server came up to us to tell us she was scared to come to our table because she knew it was taking way too long, and complained that she didn't know why they weren't done because all it took was for them to dump it in the fryer. When it actually got to the table, it was completely overdone. I didn't finish it.   Hubby's food and margarita were solid, mine was mediocre at best, and the service was bad. I would give this place one more try, but I was pretty disappointed because it was recommended by several people.",

I like spicy though so I would definitely recommend it  House margarita- they use Maestro Dobel, which is a pretty good tequila, especially for a house margarita, so I would also recommend this one  Food: I had the Carne Asada taco (not recommend) - it was pretty dry and one time I bit down and it felt like I was biting on sand so I almost gave up but decided to have another bite... felt like sand again... so yeah, not a fan.   I also had a Camero Asada taco- they were tiny shrimp and only two in the taco but regardless, it was a tasty taco.   Service: We sat at the bar so we had great service but I can't speak for dining room service.   Not the worst, but not the best. I might be back for drinks but probably not to eat.",

The grilled fish was equally uninspiring. Overall, not going to hurry back",

    "text": "Unbelievable, simply put. This place, along with their other locations in the Valley, is absolutely the best Mexican food north of the border. The decor is a traditional Mexican cantina, yet a bit more refined. While it has the great Mexican theme, it's not tacky and overdone like a lot of places. The waitress was very friendly, and the service was prompt. She did a great job of refilling waters and chips.  The homemade chips and salsa are to die for. I could literally order just four bowls of it and be satisfied. The homemade chips have a great crisp and are light and airy. The salsa has a great kick with tons of fresh ingredients.  I was feeling like a salad, which was excellent. Tortilla strips, beans, corn, house carbs asada, greens, and goat cheese. One of the best salads I've ever had. Others had the tacos, which were probably the best tacos they've ever had. The quality of ingredients is great at this place, especially the meats and veggies.  Overall, I can see why this is one of the most popular places for Mexican food in all of Phoenix. The Scottsdale location is great if you don't want to go to the original in downtown Phoenix.",

They even added in pomegranates- tasty!  The drinks were delicious especially if you like tequila!

Side of sour cream, avocado and refried black beans. Taste of everything was fantastic. Chips needed salt but were good. Salsa on the table was smoky and not too hot. Beans were seasoned well but an interesting dry texture. Will be back for more! And want the fresh Guac and an enchilada next!",

I called ahead and was told they did not take reservations. We decided to come anyway and was pleasantly surprised to see open tables on the patio and no line. However when we checked with the hostess she said 4 people were ahead of us. We found out there is a waitlist. Holding a table for people that are not there is called a reservation people. Please get your policy straight or we will not be returning. Thanks for response Lauren. I forgot to mention that we waited for over 40 minutes and there were at least 4 open tables for 20 to 30 minutes. I think enforcing your 10 minute customer response time is the issue. Not sure the hostesses we're willing to do that.",

First off the chips and salsa are quite good and still free and the $6 mug of Horchata is worthy because of it's unique creaminess.     As for main courses, my chicken mole was good enough, but did not reach epic levels due to just basically a lack of flavor. It wasn't spicy, but wasn't sweet either, so it just fell kind of flat. The other entree was more warmly received and that was the brisket enchiladas with a green sauce blanket. The meat was shredded and free of fat. It's always nice to eat a meal outside and this time of year, you can gaze at the Xmas lights while dining as a bonus.",

The happy hour margarita was so small that it was gone in 3 sips and the queso fundido that accompanied our drinks was a mass of sludge.  Our dinner was served within 5 minutes of the appetizer and was very disappointing. The carne asada burrito was more beans than steak and the three street tacos were lukewarm to cold with only one corn tortilla instead of a double which made it impossible to eat without breaking up all over the plate.  Our server disappeared after the appetizer and it was an effort to flag her down for a drink refill. The table water could benefit from filtering as it has a bad taste- a problem when your drink is empty.  Overall it would seem that this restaurant is in the tourist area of scottsdale and can deliver a less than stellar experience.",

Complimentary: chips and salsa The chips were too oily, but the fire-roasted salsa was tasty.  Appetizer: Table Side Guacamole  Fun tableside service. Nice and chunky guacamole. Our avocados weren't as ripe as they should have been, but still delicious.  Entree: Tacos The 3 tacos for $10 is a great deal. They have three vegetarian taco options on their menu that appeal to a variety of taste buds: El Taco Verduro, Rajas, and Nopalitos. The Nopalitos is made with cactus, and I was very skeptical, but it turned out to be my favorite of the three! Wish the taco tray came with beans, but they didn't. They only have vegetarian beans at their restaurant! The rest of the menu has tons of vegetarian options as well.  Also, extra points for marking their menu with vegetarian option. Overall, I would return!",

The Queso is not your traditional Queso dish and came with mushrooms, chorizo and grilled onions. I like the Queen Enchilada dish with shrimp. It's super creamy and filled with assorted cheeses. My husband loves the red sangria because it's super sweet.   This is a nice place to bring out of towners so you can show them the beautiful riverwalk and take a walk around Old Town before/after dining.",

The three stars comes from the atmosphere. We came on a Friday for dinner at 530 (vey early) and were sat at a two seater against a wall next to the bathroom, inside. There was zero elbow room, so I got bumped into every 15 min or so by a waiter or a patron.   Every two seater was jammed in like an airline attempting to squeeze every single dime out of the space it has.  I can empathize with this, but I would have much rather waited 30 min and had a table with elbow room than got seated right away.   Additionally, the chairs were outdoor wicker chairs, despite us being inside. Might sound nit picky but in 100 degree weather, with shorts on, no women wants to sit inside on a chair that is going to stick to you and leave marks on the back of her legs. Especially when there were chairs with cushions available in the other sardine like spaces.   Sorry not sorry, but I would not recommend this place.",

In my opinion, if I'm spending $15+ an entree at a sit down Mexican restaurant, I want FREE chips and salsa. This place brings it. Not only are they free, but the chips and salsa are homemade. The salsa is the kind I like to just eat with a spoon, it's so good. It's roasted and not too spicy but super full of flavor. It's the best.  We ordered tableside guacamole and loved the quantity (totally share size for at least 4) and the addition of pomegranate seeds on top, but I was hoping for a little more flavor. It was mostly just chunky avocado and some additions. I also like to be asked if I like it spicy (I do) and this guy seemed either busy or disinterested.   I ordered some enchiladas and you could totally tell the red chile sauce was made in-house. I've made my own at home and it tasted just like it. They use dried red chiles and sometimes they can't get it perfectly pureed and there are a few flakes of rough skin-- that's how you know it's fresh. It was MY FAVORITE.  My husband went with a burrito and also loved it.  My only regret was not getting there a bit sooner for a Happy Hour margarita, but otherwise this place was flawless. It also helped that we were seated outdoors on the most perfect summer evening that wasn't too hot. I'll rectify the situation soon, don't worry!",

    "text": "Really interesting place. Packed. Definitely figure out a way to avoid crowds if you can.   The food: we had the table side guacamole and chips and salsa and queso fundito. We also had their version of the skinny girl Margarita-which was delicious. Not too much salt.  Dinner was kind of a mixed bag-I had the chicken mole which was served cold - I think it was supposed to be warm. Overall the flavors were good and I enjoyed the little tortillas that came with the meal.   Fish tacos were a little fishy.   The rest of our party generally seemed to be enjoying their dinner.   This place is a little over hyped but it is solid and I wouldn't wait in line for it.",

    "text": "2nd time to Barrio Queen, 1st time at the Gilbert location, 1st. time here at the Scottsdale location. We came here for Restaurant Week to take advantage of the Sweet $33 offering. We  arrived on a Saturday at 5:30 since they do not take reservations. We were greeted and seated right away. There is a different feel between locations, Scottsdale more intimate and homey feel, Gilbert big and more commercial feeling.  At first, I thought service was going to be a disaster as we sat at the table for about 15 minutes with whom I thought would of been our waiter snubbing us, until we got the Host, who then took out drink and dinner order. Then out of the blue Adrian our server made our table side Guacamole and it was smooth sailing there after... thank you Adrian  We ordered off the Restaurant Week $33 Menu, Drink: Casa Margarita, 1st. course: Barrio Guacamole, 2nd course: Cochinita Pibil, 3rd. course: Churro. All the food was served in a timely fashion was delicious and our waiter, very attentive. On the side we also wanted to try the MX Chicken Soup which was also very good.  Scottsdale location atmosphere we loved, food excellent, service very good once our waiter for our table was established.",

I came with some friends and we were sat at a half booth half regular chairs type of table.  Chips and salsa are complimentary here. Their chips were different than typical tortilla chips, so if you're in the mood for something different then try them out!!  They do have kids menus FYI!  They had a taco special where you got three for a discounted price. They do not however have combos where the beans and rice come with the tacos. Those are an extra charge of $3 for each side. Beans and rice are separate sides. The portions are larger than normal, I was definitely full!  Oh, I also had an amazing blueberry margarita drink in a tall glass! I don't remember exactly what it was called but it was amazing!! It was flavorful and just the right amount of sweetness. I will probably come back here as it is in a convenient location! My drink was the best part :)",

This is a much larger restaurant,  with cool decor but too many chachkies for sale. The waiter was patient and attentive. Our only complaint regarding service was that another person brought us a menu of specials AFTER we had already ordered! It would have been nice to see it before!  The Carnitas Michaocan was plentiful, but not very flavorful. Disappointing for a whopping 20 bucks! It didn't even come with any tortillas. The ones I ordered on the side were three baby street taco tortillas.  The loaded fries appetizer was good. I would have rather had that for a meal, to be honest.   The kids had the Carne Asada tortas. They each ate very little, but said it was good. Who knows, really? The rest of our party had street tacos. Very expensive at 3 tacos for $10 and extra for any rice and/or beans. The Carne Asada and pastor had a pretty good flavor.  The chips and salsa were good. The iced tea was weak. I recall the Phoenix Cafe having a great passion or fruit tea. Not here.  I don't know that I will come back to this location. For what you receive, not worth the high price.",

I had the white sangria which started out tasting very sweet but was still very strong. The chips they brought out were great, crispy and salty with just a touch of grease. The salsa on the other hand was rather bland. I started with the elote appetizer which came off the cob which I loved, but the hot sauce was a little strong compared to the cayenne pepper to which I'm accustomed. I loved the selection of tacos and while the 3 for $10 price tag is steep compared to any decent taco truck, I thought it was acceptable in a sit down restaurant. The al pastor was excellent but the pescado taco was a little plain. I would go back if I were in the area again and would be interested in trying their happy hour.",

    "text": "First off i have to say that I love the food and environment at Barrio Queen. Whenever I get in there I always have a great time sitting in or outside. The reason why I am rating Barrio Queen 3 stars is because of the wait! Now I know this place can get very busy because of how popular it is but most nights there is only one hostess managing a huge crowd of people outside. Everytime I go there we are quoted from 45 minutes to an hour. Ok that's fine my boyfriend and usually just walk around and look in stores and wait. Now it has never been during that time frame.  It has either been 15 minutes (yaaaa!) Or 2+ hours....Honestly we never know what we are going to get so we always put our name down at another restaurant and see which one comes up first.  The nights that we have gone have really needed at least 2 people manage the hostess job.  What has happened in the last two times we have gone is that the hostess tells us that she might have a seat for us. So instead of writing our names down she is going to look and for us to stand off on the side. Now when she leaves there is just a random line of people waiting and newcomers anxious to get their name on the list. By the time she is coming back she is getting trampled by people just showing up to get those name on the list. Without talking to the people in line she adds newcomers names to the list and by the time she gets back to us the wait has now increased 45+ minutes.  This situation  will happen each time she checks a table or seats someone....  It is just crazy sometimes and I have probably only been able to eat there about 1/2 the times I have went to eat there.",

It's in a terrific area... trees were adorned with lights. Since I am a woman with the attention span of a fish... ooohhh look at the lights......  ........  ........  ........  Okay, I'm back. We sat in the patio and I really enjoyed it. My man-friend is smittened by their Limon y coco - this is a margarita made with coconut infused tequila... it was okay. I'm not a fan - to make it a little \"authentic\", there were like grinded up coconut pieces which made it gritty(?). No thanks! I ordered the paloma which was a grapefruit, lemon/lime and mexican squirt (yes, we went to town with the jokes). OMG!! This was so terribly tart and tangy... I put two packs of raw sugar in it and I ended up leaving 3/4 of the drink. What a waste of $11. We did order the original and chocolate flan. The chocolate was way too decadent... I prefer the original.",

I like restaurants that differentiate themselves from the rest. Everybody at our table like their dish. Carne Asada burrito and enchilada's all tasted good. We sat outside, it was nice and quiet. Great atmosphere. Flowers smelled good on the patio and everything.   Only thing was that the waiter forgot to bring water that we asked for and my wife was choking from the chips and salsa and I asked him if he could bring out a water for her. And he said \"Oh thats right! Well let me just take your orders first while I'm here\"   ...Moment of survival...  Maybe he thought I would just let her have a sip of my beer, I don't know but shes 4 months pregnant so it came down to let her choke or give the fetus alcohol. And I chose choke because I had a feeling her chance of survival was higher if we waited for water.",

The tacos were something like $3.50 - $4.00 range and based on the size seemed like they should be maybe 75 cents.    All in all:  Good food, but it's way overpriced.",

A server came out after about 5 minutes and introduced himself, but then another server came and told him that she didn't think that was his table so he left....and then about 5 minutes later a different server came out and took our drink order.  The longest wait was from when we were seated to us getting our first drink.  After that things came out much more quickly.  That said.....drinks were good.  Margaritas were strong and only $3 dollars during happy hour which is apparently all day.  We had the tableside guacamole which was really good.  It was also Taco Tuesday so all tacos are $2.50 instead of $3.50.  I tried the napolitas (sp) which was ok.  It kind of tasted like green beans to me.  A bit on the bland side.  I also had the smoked salmon with mango taco.  That was good, but in my opinion it would have been better with un-smoked salmon.  The mango on it really helped freshen it up though.  My cousin has a burrito and she said it was great and as for the sauce that was on top....well, she wanted to lick it off her plate.  Enough said.  We also shared the flan which, although I am not an expert on flan or anything as I've only had a bite of it a couple of times, it was really, really good.  All in all, I'll definitely go back.",

French press is used and the coffee inexpensive as you are supplied with a full pot. Everything we have tried is excellent. I would strongly recommend trying this eatery.",

    "text": "Barrio Queen is a more or less tranditional Mexican restaurant, done in upscale tones, and set in a fairly nice part of downtown Scottsdale.  About half of the tables are outside with views of the shops and, depending on the time of day, people walking by.    The thing that distinguishes Barrio Queen is that they have talent in the kitchen.  Everything we tried was a surprise, usually a good one.  This is a magic restaurant - nothing is what it seems.    For example, the Menudo is actually a much harder to find and exotic dish - Pata y Mondongo - tripe and calves' hooves.  Served in a slightly spicy tomato broth, it is exceptional.  Then there is the Chile Verde, a large portion of remarkably tender chunks of pork with a few onions and chilis, cilantro sprinkled on top, and just enough broth to keep it moist.  Nearly a meal in itself, it is a far cry from most chiles you will get in restaurants.  The Chiles en Nogado is a stuffed chili with a mixture of chicken chunks, dried apricot, onion, and garlic.  The surprise here is that the other ingredients listed on the menu were present, if at all, in only tiny amounts.  The result was a dish with good but simple flavor, lacking the complexities it should have.  The sauce was a overly-mild cream sauce with a couple of slivered almonds and added nothing.  Still it was enjoyable for what it was, just a bit disappointing for $22.  The only real miss was the Tres Leches dessert.  Once more a surprise but this time a very bad one.  This is really strawberry shortcake with just enough condensed milk (or something) to make the flavorless pound cake into a mush resembling bad oatmeal.  If not for this, I could have given Barrio Queen five stars.  HINT:  This place is busy even on weekdays.  If outside seating is not attractive due to heat, cold, wind, or rain, you very likely will have to wait.  As far as I can tell, they do not take reservations.  Parking can also be a problem.",

Also the bartender is bomb as hell. I can't remember his name, but super attentive and helpful. Sat at the bar both times and had the same bartender.   I am from Texas (San Antonio) originally so always love some good Mexican food. I love their tacos and their margaritas. I've had the following items:  Cocktel de Elote - so yummy and just as I would expect Elote. I ordered it as a side when I got tacos.   Barrio Papas - I got half and half of the toppings. I will be honest the Elote style topping was better. But I enjoyed the topping more than the fries. They are steak cut fries and just more filling than anything. Not super yummy for the amount of fullness they give you. Didn't care for the pork green chili topping much at all.  3 Tacos (Al Pastor, Barrio Pollo con Chorizo, & Carnitas) - Al pastor is a go to for me and it came out great. wasn't too saucey at all. The Barrio Pollo con Chorizo was recommended by the bartender and it was AMAZING. If you love the flavor of chorizo it's a must get! Carnitas I don't usually get and this reminded me why. They are usually dry and flavorless.   Suizas Enchiladas - the second time I went this was recommended by the bartender and he said it was his favorite by far. I was TOTALLY impressed and blown away by these enchiladas. Again you get the enchiladas topped with Chorizo which I love and hadn't had any where else!! It is so damn good! You can taste the cheeseness melted also. so freaking yummy!!",

There are all kinds of knick knacks displayed that you can actually purchase.  The service was good, the food was good.  I ordered a variety of authentic tacos-not the typical taco bell meat cheese sour cream type.  Think more like fresh orange and garlic marinated grilled beef, over roasted jalapeno and quesillo cheese relleno, topped with diced onion, cilantro and avocado or maybe spice rubbed chicken, caramelized onions and roasted poblano peppers in a spicy pinon cream sauce, topped with chorizo and cilantro.    Bring Barrio Queen to the East Coast!!",

    "text": "Once was in the Barrio, now in the boardroom  fortunately.  I made it out, but the memories of where I came from and where I am have never left and remind me daily of the difference between success and failure.   Before I go on too long, the bottom line is I would recommend taking a pass on Barrio Queen.  Prices are a bit steep based upon the quality and presentation of the food.   I also found the staff a bit pretentious in asking if I wanted change from my $100.00 bill for a $52.00 check.   I note this because conceptually Barrio Queen tries to make the right choices for the most part. but comes up a bit short, as in the narrow difference between success and failure.   Barrio Queen is conveniently located.  When my wife, daughter and I dined the restaurant was clean with attractive decor and intriguing menu items.  The one issue I have though with \"trendy\" Mexican restaurants is the use of black beans and the omission of pinto or other types of beans historically consumed by natives of Mexico and Central America.  We were told by the server that the restaurant does not serve rice and only black beans True to native Mexico.   I found that a bit odd based upon my knowledge, travel and consumption of Mexican and Latin American foods based upon many factors, including travel throughout Central and South America.   I found the tacos to be decent but with no sauce to add to compliment the presentation and the guacamole to have 1/4 avocado size chunks (perhaps intentionally) with minimal flavor.   The one thing Latin food should have is flavor.  Some of my best meals have been in dives and dumpy looking restaurants.  Unfortunately, Barrio Queen comes up short in the food category, beautiful setting but below average cuisine and certainly not worth the price.",

    "text": "We went here on Taco Tuesday ($2 tacos), mainly because the first restaurant we wanted to eat at was closed.  We were greeted by our server, who immediately tried to push alcoholic drinks on us.  We came here at lunch time on a weekday, so I wasn't really in the mood to get hammered, but we did order some aguas frescas instead (Horchata and jamaica, it was either 5 or 6 dollars).  They were a hefty price, but it was served in a very large glass.  My horchata was OK, it had decent flavor and was fairly refreshing.  The jamaica was very concentrated, so if you like a lot of tangy hibiscus flavor this is the drink for you.    We ended up ordering a variety of tacos, but not before our server tried to push some guacamole (Around $6) on us.  We didn't really want any at first, but she insisted that it was some of the best guacamole ever and was one of the best appetizers in the house.  Soo.... we begrudgingly accepted, since we wanted to see what the hype was about.  When we got the appetizer, it was in a tiny little bowl, and covered with pomegranate seeds.  It tasted OK, and was made with fresh ingredients, but I can honestly make fresh guacamole like this at home with bigger portions for way cheaper.    The tacos were small, like street taco size.  They came on a single small corn tortilla, and were piled high with filling.  I would have liked to see them use 2 tortillas on top of each other for stability, because I couldn't really hold the tacos in my hand to eat them.  Because they were so full, and the ingredients were a bit juicy, they would fall off while the tortilla fell apart as soon as I picked it up.  Sadly, I had to actually eat most of the tacos with a fork and knife like a gringo.  I do appreciate the generous amount of filling that was in them though, but at taquerias I've been to they typically double the street taco tortillas for this very reason.  As for the ingredients themselves, they have some unusual ones here you won't find at other Mexican restaurants, which I appreciate, but on the whole I didn't find the tacos too great taste-wise.  I had some huitlacoche tacos, a first for me, but the whole kernels of fungus-infected corn popped in my mouth as I ate them with a gooey, mushy texture on the inside, with not much flavor.  It wasn't too pleasant of a experience taste and texture wise; I felt like I was eating a bunch of pus.  Perhaps if they were chopped into smaller pieces rather than whole kernels it would have tasted better, since a big kernel on a small taco can overwhelm the whole dish.  Additionally, our server was fairly attentive, as long as there was something for her to push on us.  But, when it came time to get the check, she was no where to be seen, and we had to wait a very long time before anyone came over to our table.    So the mixture of very pushy service combined with tacos that were memorable in all the wrong ways make me hesitant to try this restaurant again when I can get really tasty Mexican food for way cheaper at other places in the East Valley.",

It's very eclectic & the cages they keep the top shelf tequilas are pretty neat. The drinks were delicious. I had a michelada & the BF had a Paloma. Our bartender was really sweet & efficient. I want to say her name was Melissa (cute blonde chick). The food great. I don't normally like black beans but their's were awesome. Only problem with this place is their guac. When I think of guac I think of a paste sorta texture. Their guac was literally chopped up avocado & tomato. Also lacked some lime & salt. Despite the guac I'd come back.",

Pibil and Chicken plates are great if not feeling tacos, and guac is must every time. Chef Sylvania is pretty damn brilliant with the flavor combos here.",

    "text": "Great Mexican food + Sugar Skull makeup = super fun night.  This was my first time and Barrio Queen and I'm addicted. I was able to enjoy this great October night out on their patio in Old Town Scottsdale. Tonight was a Day of the Dead theme party which they will also have on Nov 1st and Nov 2nd (2014) with live music and face painting for a fun and festive celebration.  Food was Ah-mazing. Mainly I am speaking of the tacos and churros. The chips were tasty and the guacamole was okay, it wasn't bad, but I felt like there were a lot of other ingredients mixed in that it became hard to taste the avocados. Another appetizer, the Vasito de Elote, consisted of grilled corn kernels that are severed in a cup, topped with butter, mayo, cotija cheese, Valentina hot sauce, cilantro, and lime was good, but anything topped with butter is better.  I also sampled the Ceviche Salad, which wasn't my cup of tea, but that rarely is so don't let my opinion skew yours. Okay so onto the tacos, I tried the Al Pastor (marinated pork topped with diced onion, cilantro, fresh pineapple, and red salsa) and the Huitlacoche y Champinon which is packed with mushrooms, shallots and garlic topped with pico de gallo. Both were so good and I love mushrooms and am still salivating over these tacosl - so flipping good. Oh and the churros? Not only are they fried and rolled in cinnamon and sugar to perfection, but THEY ARE STUFFED WITH CARAMEL (or maybe it was butterscotch, I couldn't tell, but it didn't really matter!   Being that this is a Tequileria, I had to try a couple of their margaritas even though tequila isn't my favorite (mainly I have to say \"bye\" to whoever I am with because my autopilot gets switched on). I ended up trying the Limon y Coco Margarita first since it is a coconut flavored tequila and it could ease me in - man was it tasty. I love pina coldas and thus reminded me of that, but melted, and not as sweet, I wanted another to order another one, but also I went for something else. That being their Casa Margarita which was still flavorful compared to other restaurant house margs I have tried and I recommend it along with the Limon y Coco.   The service here is wonderful and I would come back just for that reason. Staff is friendly, fast, and efficient. Something that I don't take for granted.   The bummer is that they do not take reservations and with the size of the restaurant you may have to wait awhile for a table if you come during prime time hours. Also, for what I am used to with Mexican food, these prices seem a bit higher. On the plus they do have great specials if you are able to catch them. I will be back",

    "text": "It appears that the service kinks have been worked out as our server was very attentive and the food came out quickly. Guacamole was tasty and fun and tacos were innovative and delicious. I don't want to argue the point of whether Barrio Queen aspires to be authentic street food or Mexican fusion, consensus at our table was that it's a bit of both and the experience was so pleasant that honestly we don't care and we will return soon.  Of note, automatic chips and salsa at the beginning of the meal would be a nice touch and more opportunities to add serious heat (habanero, serrano, jalapeno) would have been a wonderful adjunct.",

    "text": "Full review to be blogged:  With service efficient and gracious, one of many servers arrived with my first course - the two for $3 Happy Hour taco pairing of Nopal and Barrio Polo, plus a $4 addition entitled Champinon, huitlacoche, y cotija.  With the Nopal a downgraded version of the egg topped item on the standard menu served only at happy hour and featuring tender cactus with a bit of salt and pepper plus queso fresco atop a four inch corn tortilla I started with it expecting it to be the most mild and as anticipated, it was quite bland.  Moving next to better options, the Barrio polo featured the same warm and tender tortilla topped with chicken, onions, green chilis, and hefty cream sauce plus Oaxaca cheese while the corn smut iteration proved to be by far the most complex and balanced of the trio, the woodsy mushrooms and aromatic shallots heavily perfumed by the huitlacoche.  All in all a good start, but certainly not the best I've tasted and skewed far to the left in terms of cost/quality.  Curious as to how the pork at BQ stands up to others in the valley I next opted for the carnitas appetizer but was instead served a carnitas taco - cheaper at $3 compared to $9, but not what I'd asked for.  Not really wanting to make a fuss and figuring I could save the stomach capacity this was another decent taco - fatty pork with ample notes of marjoram, thyme, and garlic served with a light accompaniment of onions and cilantro...2 good bites, but nothing to write home about, especially when compared to what arrived with it.  Presented along with the carnitas, the \"El Rey Vasito de Elote\" is apparently a signature dish and as much as one may find it hard to see corn as a signature, this is pretty darn good.  Described on the menu as sweet grilled corn in a cup topped with butter, mayo, aged cotija cheese, tapatio salsa, cilantro & lime at a cost of $5 what made the dish really shine was mostly the corn and the cotija - sweet, savory, and smoky at once with just a bit of acid to meld all the flavors.  Served solo and meant to share this dish is also offered over fries, but for my money it was best taken by the spoonful alongside other plates or wrapped in a warm tortilla, free on request.  For my final round of savories I went with one of the weekend specials and an order from the 'masa' section of the menu and having expected more small plates I certainly got more than I'd expected from both.  Beginning first with the later, a dish called Tlacoyos arrived with three mashed corn fritters topped with smoky chicken, black beans, salsa verde, oregano, pickled onions, cotija cheese and lightly sweetened cream.  Having expected something more akin to a traditional corn fritter form the $9 plate what I really liked about this open-face interpretation was once again the balance - a composition of flavors and textures akin to the Elote but tilted further to the savory yet finishing with light sweetness imparted by the cream.  Moving to the biggest dish of the night the tripe and hominy soup entitled 'menudo' arrived in an enormous bowl and at a cost of $5 it was simply outstanding.  Featuring a rich tomato stock rife with offal, bones, tender hominy, and myriad spices plus a quartet of onions, cilantro, lime, and pimento pepper with which I was free to further season as I like this was a portion easily big enough for two but so good that those who love tripe should probably just order one of their own.  Still with two and a half hours before dinner at this point my server again stopped by and after perusing the dessert menu I decided to end the meal with another duet, one a must order anywhere I see it and the other a must order at any Mexican restaurant but at $6 a piece I should have probably just ordered a margarita, entree, or another half-gallon of menudo instead.  Beginning first with the rice pudding - a small bowl of relatively standard white rice with hints of cinnamon and orange subsequently dotted with golden raisins and curls of cinnamon plus, reportedly, \"Vanilla Kahlua sauce\" it would be hard to find a less flavorful dish containing such ingredients and with the rice cold and clumpy all I could do was wonder if I'd received the previous night's leftovers - a suspicion more or less confirmed when I tried the three milk cake, a dense and dry pound cake parfait made palatable only by the berries and most certainly not by the cream I can only guess came from a ready-whip can.  As a further note, where both dishes were advertised to contain nuts - specifically pecans, none were detected in either.  Not one to complain except in the setting of egregious service or truly disastrous food I sat for a while with desserts unfinished watching the game still pondering how I'd spent so much on so little that impressed.  Best new restaurant?  Um - sure - for corn and tripe.",
