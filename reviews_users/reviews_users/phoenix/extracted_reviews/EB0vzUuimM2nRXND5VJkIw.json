Every place is a little different in how they adapt the sushi without rice, so I'm never sure what I'll get, but after the initial confusion, the chef was great. The rolls I ordered were perfect and delicious, exactly what I asked for! Also, happy hour runs from 11:30am-5pm with great options and prices.  Definitely found my new favorite sushi place!",

    "text": "As long as Mido exists they'll have a customer. Very peculiar that the best sushi in town (in my opinion) is also the cheapest. Don't order so much at once if you can't handle their odd policies regarding uneaten food. And keep in mind that they usually have only one employee on staff who is a native English speaker. I get the sense that a lot of the more negative reviews simply boil down to miscommunication.   Here's the rundown for newbies:  1) Walk in. If a table is open, point to it and ask if you can sit there. If there's a wait there's a wait. Generally not long.  2) Disregard any papers they give you that aren't yellow. The yellow form is all you can eat.   3) clarify if your whole table is all you can eat or if only some are.  4) Tempura is free if you ask  5) Don't forget to order hand rolls.   6) Don't assume that the food will come out slow if they're busy and definitely don't assume it'll come out quickly if they're not (I know).  7) If you're expecting their signature sushi boat platter thing, ask if they can put your order on it. Otherwise if your order is small they may just put it on a standard serving plate.   Enjoy and be prepared to abandon all your other sushi spots.",

The whole time, I saw the young lady bring out small bowls of soup to the other tables but never once to check on our bowl of soup. Time went by and still nothing.  We told the younger girl to bring us the check and to remove the soup. She must not understand how to cross something off the bill because she came back with nothing change. At the end another older lady took care of our bill and made it right.  I don't think we will be going back.",

I took my neighbors to dinner here last Friday night as a thank you for watching my dog while I was in Las Vegas for a week.   The service was excellent.  We never waited for a refill.  We were brought the check as soon as we needed it.  And, the server put up with a lot of interesting conversation whenever he happened upon it (and laughed with us).  The value was phenomenal.  Where else can four adults and two children start with miso soup and crab salad, eat a gorgeous platter of sashimi, a tempura appetizer, sushi until they are filled and a scoop of ice cream PLUS have sodas and wine for $121 pre tip?  My only suggestion to AYCE newbies is to order the more expensive rolls first.  We just put all our rolls on the first sheet and we got the cheaper rolls like California roll and spicy tuna out first.  Then after a good amount of time, they brought the smaller, more expensive Pancho topped with spicy tuna and the soft shell crab rolls.  It is not a big deal if you have an unlimited appetite, but you might as well get the more pricey rolls with AYCE.",

Overall, the experience is well worth it. Especially if you get to hear the birthday song.",

Our waters were barely filled. Our orders were forgotten, and I ended up finishing my entire meal before the rest of the table got their food (I ate very slowly, and gosh, I felt so bad for my friends).   We could tell that the limited amount of waiters were trying hard to keep up, but the owners need to hire more waiters because not nearly enough attention was given to the customers.   As for sushi options, Mido Sushi had the typical variety of sushi that could be found in other places. They have an all-you-can-eat option for around $21, and bowls, bento boxes, and sashimi to name a few.   Bottom line: okay sushi, pretty bad service, but some pretty good deals assuming you're doing the all-you-can-eat (if you can eat a lot, of course). I personally wouldn't recommend the place until they step up their customer service.",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying that the very first sushi experience I had was at a little restaurant named Sushi Hama in Tucson years and years ago. I LOVE sushi and the first time I had it I was instantly hooked (they have this specialty roll- the \"Pancho roll\"- named after the owner). They've since opened several locations and are under new management. Whenever I go back to Tucson I make it a point to stop by this place. (P.S. If anyone reading this makes a pit stop in Tucson- check this place out [or at least the Yelp page]).  So, the other day my bf and I had a craving for sushi and wanting to try a new place we stopped in here. As I'm looking through the menu I see a \"Pancho roll\" and a \"Tucson roll\" on the menu. I immediately light up and ask the sushi chef behind the bar if a Pancho works here. Sure enough the former owner of Sushi Hama is now here! I don't know if he owns this place or not but he still makes THE best sushi! The Pancho roll was just as good as I had remembered it being and the experience brought me back to the first time I'd had that roll many moons ago. We ended up getting the all you can eat which comes with the familiar salad w/ sesame oil salad dressing, miso soup and edamame. Every roll we had was delicious and Pancho even made a special extra spicy tuna roll for my bf.  I am so happy to have accidentally stumbled upon this place and I tell you- I will definitely be hitting this place up when I need my sushi fix!",

    "text": "This is my go-to spot for sushi in Arizona. Being a native Californian, Asian American, and mild sushi snob, I have to say that the all-you-can eat here is the best bang for your buck I've seen. For $20 in Cali, you might be able to gain entry into one of those AYCE Asian seafood buffets, where the freshness of the fish is sacrificed in the name of variety.   But at Mido, it's all about the fish. I mean, when I'm feeling ambitious I'll enjoy their crispy tempura basket beforehand. And I wouldn't miss the Japanese red bean/green tea/mango ice cream at the end. But the real star of the show is the nigiri. The quality & freshness can waver from visit to visit, but even on a bad day it's pretty good. I tend to like their salmon, hamachi (yellowtail), and white toro (fatty tuna) the best. Their rolls are good too, but I can never bring myself to order them. Maybe because I can hear my Chinese father's voice in my head, telling me to shovel as much of the expensive stuff into my stomach as I can.   Still fresh in my memory is the Sunday night when our whole party could've sworn they had just flown the fish in from Japan and delivered it straight to our table. Rich, melt-in-your-mouth goodness that's only ever been topped by my days going to Sasabune in LA with my sugar daddy/foodie friend.   Fun and sweet sushi chefs too. One time they heard I would have to drive 1.5 hours back home, and they sent me off with a free Diet Coke!",

The all-you-can-eat is great and comes with your choice of tempura or gyoza appetizer and sashimi for 2. SO GOOD, the white toro and salmon are our faves! It's always fresh and cold, never warm sushi! It's not one of those uber-trendy places, which is great from our point of view (we hate Snobbsdale). It's GREAT quality and the amount of fish you receive is definitely a generous amount! If you're not into all-you-can-eat, they have a really generous happy hour that extends until night time, not just for lunchers. Oh, did I mention $6 sake bombers all the time? Holla! lol",

If I had to give this place a ranking on the list of all the sushi establishments I've visited it would definitely fall towards the bottom of my list for taste and quality.  It started off with edamame (and not very good edamame at that), miso soup (lukewarm at best) and a small salad (consisted of lettuce, sesame dressing and a piece of imitation crab).  I had hoped the sub par openers wouldn't be a sign of things to come, but unfortunately that turned out not to be the case.    I was attracted to the idea of Mido Sushi after seeing that they have an all-you-can-eat sushi option for $19.99, and many of the reviews on here stating that quality did not suffer as a result of endless rolls.  Now that I've been here, I will say that the all-you-can-eat sushi option would be great if you were looking for quantity rather than quality.  However, if you could be satisfied with just two or three rolls I would say there are better options out there that wouldn't cost anymore than Mido's all-you-can-eat option.  Since my eyes are usually bigger than my stomach, and I prefer higher quality sushi than I had here, I'll probably find a better option in the area next time.",

The place was not totally full last night when we got there as a party of 4.  After articulating our order several times, we ordered appetizers, drinks and 4 dinners.  Everyone in my family was served their dinners (no appetizers) except for me.  I did not say anything until I noticed a table of 4 that sat down after we got there were served drinks.  I asked our one of many servers (never had one consistent server) when we might get our drinks.  She said sorry they forgot them.  Still waiting for my dinner and the appetizers.  My family is almost finished eating.  I then finally ask about the appetizers and my dinner to which I was asked, \"what did I order?\"  Needless to say they forgot my order and also the appetizer.  finally after 40 plus minutes my dinner arrived and when it was brought to me, the server said. \"Tuna roll with 11 pieces of Sushi instead of 10 pieces because they felt bad about all the problems\"  That was very humorous as any other place would have probably taken if off the bill.  So here I am eating by myself while the rest of my family are finished when finally, the appetizer arrives...........the greasiest absolute worst Tempura I have ever seen served anywhere!  I need to keep going to the place I have been going for years and NOT go to a place just because it is close to home and I want to help patronize my local businesses.  I will not go back unless I hear they have gotten their act together service-wise.",

It's about 40 miles from my home and I try to go about once a month, if I lived closer, I'd go more often, it's that good.  The Owner Pancho is always so friendly and nice.  The only reason I gave 4 stars though, is because sometimes when it's busy the waiters/waitress aren't all that friendly and it takes them a while to get to our table, which is understandable, because I know how it is in the food business. But about a year ago they all used to be really nice.  Go there on your birthday, and they'll dim the lights, play cute \"Happy Birthday\" music and let you blow out your candle on wasabi:)",

There's no real creativity (except for the disco balls during \"happy birthday\", seriously, uh yes) and it's fairly generic fare. The 2 stars are really for the fact the service was Johnny on the spot for edamame, miso and salad. The main fare though, just plain lacking. You're better off heading a mile or 2 down Ray over to Ra.",

Nonetheless, the food has always been tasty and an extra treat with the small salad and edamame appetizers that come to each table.  Chance the server is also excellent and a pleasure.    What has drug the star count down from 5 to 3 is my last visit for a Saturday happy hour ended up with me 3 hours later puking on Chandler Blvd at a stop light.  No doubt it was food poisoning that lasted a few hours.  I'm not a big fan of vomiting especially from bad food.    I realize that you take certain risks when eating sushi but in a nutshell............ bad fish just CAN'T HAPPEN!    To reiterate, I've eaten at this establishment many times with no ill affects and loved it but...........eater beware.",

The first thing that was obvious is that the tempura/gyoza, sashimi offering is quite large.  It's a full plate of tempura with 5 or 6 vegtables and two shrimp.  The gyoza had five pieces.  The sashimi plate had 5 or 6 different fish with 5 or 6 slices each.    However, the taste and quality of the food was just so so.  The tempura was soggy rather than crispy.  The gyoza was oily.  The sashimi plate didn't have a lot of flavor.  I ordered Unagi, Albacore and the Mido roll.  All were ok, but not must haves.    The service was excellent and everyone was friendly.   Although I had left over food, there wasn't a charge.  Great place if you are on a budget and starving, however if you want quality sushi and willing to pay for it, I would look elsewhere.",

    "text": "I found this place a year ago, by driving by. During that time I was not a huge sushi fanatic. The most adventurous thing I would eat was shrimp tempura rolls. And avocado rolls. I was really craving avocado, so I went in and checked it out. I've tried many many avocado rolls at sushi restaurants, but Mido had proven to be #1. The avocado is always fresh, and the roll is delicious! After my first visit I was hooked.   Since I found this place I go at least once a week. My sushi knowledge has expanded and now I can say I eat real sushi. I got over my fear of raw fish, and take pleasure in ordering all kinds of rolls. The ingredients are always fresh. I have yet to be disappointed, and I'm a regular. They always start you off with a miso soup and a salad. They're super tasty. The salad has ponzu sauce, which you can also order a side of for your meal.   Their prices can't be beat. It's very hard to find good quality food for a low price. They offer a 50% happy hour menu with lots of choices. Happy hour is all day mon-thu. They also offer all you can eat sushi for about $22. I usually am way too stuffed to be able to eat enough to justify it, so I stick to happy hour.  I have not once gotten sick eating here, which I can't say the same for other sushi restaurants. I always come back to Mido.   Very friendly staff, I love coming here and will continue to bring family and friends to Mido. Everyone I've brought has been amazed at the quality and prices of the sushi. Great place! Keep it up!",

There is no one in this restaurant speaks a single Japanese word. But that's not the problem. When it comes to costumer service and food, you literally want to stab yourself with the chopsticks. The waitress rushed us to take order, and she came three times in less than 15 minutes.   After ordering the food, they just drop the plate on the table. Since the soups and salad was free, I won't complain about it, but I have to say they taste horrible. The sushi was so poorly made that they even forgot the most essential ingredient: the rice vinegar.  Yes the sushi was half off, but I didn't expect the quality of the sushi half off. Of all the sushi place I went to, this restaurant is the only one has no idea they are doing the sushi wrong.  Then here comes the big play of Mido sushi's costumer torturing game. I have never had such a boring Tepan chicken. There is no caramelization on 360 degree views of the chicken breast cubes. Yes, chicken freaking breast cubes! The most boring part of chicken ever. And they cost me $16 just for that huge chunk of tasteless bird. I beg you please change the name if the food you are cooking is not the dish on the menu.  Thank you for worsening my already 7 hours tiring trip.",

The staff is awesome (an Asian guy in his early 20s and a middle aged Asian lady were working during the times I've come in), food is crazy cheep, food is tasty, AND I didn't get food poisoning.   As far as quality of the food, you're paying for something that SHOULD BE rated at half a star BUT you're getting like, 3.5-4.5 star quality. They have all you can eat menus, happy hour at basically all hours of the weekday, and already cheap prices.  To give an example, my friend and I came here, got 7 platters of sushi (stuff like Vegas roll, California roll, etc), 6 piece each (I think). And we paid 23 dollars (before tip), of course.  It's not fine dining, so don't take the love of your life here if you're about to propose -- you'd look cheep as hell.  They have some actual Japanese food here (Their food is way different in Japan in the same way that Panda Express isn't real Chinese food), but most of their food is \"American Japanese food\".  Seriously. Amazing stuff and totally worth a try.",

First and foremost, everyone talks about the happy hour, the happy hour is the entire time they are open. So its really not a happy hour, just discounted items 24/7. In addition, the happy hour menu, isn't that great, I came to eat rolls because my bf was craving just sushi rolls, but every roll I saw had cream cheese. Cream cheese is in my opinion a cop out, it gives the sushi a creamier taste without using more \"expensive\" avocados and it is awful because it completely covers up all other flavors in the roll. Many of the rolls were deep fried as well. We ordered a couple of rolls and some nigiri, the fish didn't taste fresh and many of them had a weird aftertaste to them.  I like americanized sushi and rolls, but I like them to be done well and this place didn't execute it well at all. In addition, we got the tempura and the shrimp had no flavor. It just tasted like breading...   I wouldn't recommend this place at all, I think chain sushi places make better rolls than Mido.",

    "text": "Mido is the perfect sushi place because it's exactly the right balance of quality and value.  We eat there whenever we want decent sushi - we know we'll get a good product for a good price.  Every meal starts with a salad , miso soup, and edemame.   Why are people complaining about these?  They're free!  And they're good!  Simple, but still very good... and free.  We usually get the All-You-Can-Eat for $20.   I have the tempura appetizer and BF gets the gyoza appetizer.  Both of these typically come out after our first plate of sushi.  That's just how it works at Mido - accept it.  That doesn't mean the service is bad, it just means the sushi came out really quick.  The tempura is wonderful and I really appreciate that they have a large variety of vegetables - bell pepper, carrot, two kinds of sweet potato, mushroom, broccoli, and asparagus (!) - in addition to two shrimp.  The gyoza is pretty standard but the dipping sauce is great and they're always perfectly pan fried.  When it comes to sushi, we mostly stick with nigiri.  The toro, snapper, yellowtail, and shrimp are all really good - fresh and clean tasting.  The salmon is WONDERFUL.  The sushi chef puts a little tiny bit of wasabi on each piece (there's a tip for all the people who mix wasabi into their soy - don't overdo it at Mido).  And the Unagi, which is my favorite, is perfectly done every time.  No pin bones, not over cooked, but not cold either.  Delicious!  As for the rolls - well, I love the rolls at Mido because it's one of the few places where they'll make them without avocado.  I'm allergic and the Mido chefs are always accommodating.  We try different rolls almost every time we go in.  They also have a couple I've never seen anywhere else, like the Gyoza roll.  I've seen a couple complaints about the staff, but we've never had an issue.  Even when they're super busy, they make an effort to serve everyone quickly and politely.  And if you sit at or near the bar, a sushi chef will throw you a hot towel and speak some Spanish to you - very fun!  To sum up - go to Mido if you want to eat a lot of good sushi and not spend a ton of money.",

However, on walking in and smelling a fowl smell and then being given a salad which consisted of iceberg lettuce, peanut oil and soy sauce dressing, I knew this would be interesting. The fish was not fresh at all with a very pungent odor and inconsistent cuts on mounds of white rice. The eel was so thick and long it created an odd consistency in my mouth. I moved on to the rolls which were subpar at best and then gave up tossing cash on the table to get out of there and go find something to get the God awful taste of old fish out of my mouth. I am disappointed to say the least. If the locals see fit to give it 4-5 stars, so be it. I will drive 4-5 hours to Midori Sushi in LA, as should all of you! Educate your pallets, Chandler.

Luke warm, limp lettuce topped with a flavorless ginger dressing. It's only saving grace was the tiny, yet delicious, piece of crab on top.   The sushi was mediocre and definitely not something to write home about. The only roll worth mentioning was the Mido Roll, which was rather delicious.   I won't be back, even if the prices are temping. Check out Sapporo in North Scottsdale. It's got the best sushi in the valley.",

    "text": "I don't care what any of you say, this place is the shizzle!  I've been to a LOT of sushi joints in the valley and none of them really have FANTASTIC sushi, merely different price points and presentation, neither of which make these places any more appealing to me.    First off, I tend to favor little hole in the wall joints rather than big fancy pants chains that are trying to be cooler than they really are.  Second, it's the best sushi you can get a a reasonable price.  Third,  if the service is good, that means I WILL be back.  Chance was our server this time, and was so witty and on the ball that it sealed the deal for our return.  We actually discovered Mido by mistake and couldn't have had a more fortunate accident!  My group ordered a number of the, um,  strangely named rolls, some of which were pretty damn delicious, others may not have suited my taste but were interesting nonetheless.  The first experience proved to be comical and appealing for reasons beyond the food;  the Ha Ha (HOT) roll being \"a little warm\" as an understatement, the sudden fear that the place may turn into a karaoke bar later in the night, and the look of pure raging hatred on the face of a hip Japanese teen when his birthday ice cream was brought to him with a candle and a song.   Fortunately no one ended up a burn victim,  nor is Mido a were-karaoke bar and the kid was not successful in his efforts to use his mind powers to induce cranial explosions in both his mother and father.  Since then, we tend to go there at least once a week (or more) and make it a point to go there anytime someone is celebrating a birthday!  Keep in mind that I live in central Phoenix and drive all the way to Chandler to go munch at this joint.  Since Zen32 closed, there isn't anywhere closer that I enjoy nearly as much.  Can't beat the price for all you can eat sushi, either.  Not even crappy sushi buffets can touch the $20 deal, which includes appetizers, dessert and a plate of sashimi that would run $40 anywhere else.  The three sushi chefs are unique on their own.  Pancho heads up the pack with a friendly attitude and good humor.  Definitely makes you feel welcome and can entertain you in a great deal of different languages.    On a final note, If it's your birthday, be sure to opt in for the free ice cream and let them know it's your birthday!",

Without even ordering the waitress brought us miso soup, salad, edamame and a tray of sashimi. Also, we asked for free hot tea and spicy mayonnaise. We ordered different rolls, but the major upsetting thing was that they add baby carrots that smelled like they were chemically treated to almost all the sushi .We had to physically remove them from every single piece of sushi.   It was a lot of people in the restaurant and only 2 waitresses, So we had to wave and call them to our table a lot of times. In the end we asked for red bean and mango ice cream. I think it's better to pay a little more, but have better quality and service. I will not be coming back here, for sure.",

We were greeted when we came in and seated where ever we wanted. There were not too many people there yet but it was a little early still. Very nice staff. Very friendly and helpful. All you can eat sushi for $20 is hard to turn down. I never know what rolls to get so my girlfriend made the selections. We got a Vegas roll, a Dragon roll, a Mexican roll and a Philly roll. They came out pretty quick and they were good but a few of them had a carrot in them. I have never had sushi with carrot in it. Never. I have had sushi from a few different places. It almost seemed like they ran out of something and decided to substituted carrot instead. Just as a filler. So it wasn't great but it wasn't bad either. Kind of disappointing after all of the great reviews. I might be talked into going one more time and see if the carrot disappears but if it doesn't then I think I am good with going somewhere else. I have been to better places and sure it might cost more but I would rather pay for quality if that is what I have to do.",

I decided to check with Yelp and see if there are any Japanese places close to the office so that I could have some miso soup for lunch.  This idea led to the following:  \"Mido Sushi!\"  \"Yes, do you have Miso soup?\"  \"Hello?\"  \"Do you have miso soup?\"  \"Mido Sushi!\"  \"DO YOU HAVE MISO SOUP?\"  \"Soup?  Miso?\"  \"Yes.\"  \"Hello?\"  \"YES!\"  \"Mido Sushi!\"  \"MISO SOUP!\"  \"You come get!\"  \"Ok.  Hello?\"  \"Click.\"  *from the next office*   \"You're having miso soup for lunch?  Sounds good.\"  So the miso soup was inexpensive. I got basically a quart for about $1.75. The broth itself was pretty good but it had minimal tofu and no scallions or other garnish.  Average miso at best but when you have the flu it works well.",

Well today after completing my purchases, I left the store, and noticed this Japanese music playing over the outdoor sound system.  Sam had reminded me of a sushi restaurant a few doors down, and I decided to give it a shot (since I need a few more reviews before achieving # 100).  I plopped down at the sushi bar, and scribbled a mark next to 'spicy tuna roll' and 'asparagus roll'.  I was immediately handed a salad topped with crunchy tempura batter.  Noticing some kind of potential shellfish in the salad, I inquired as to the identity of the mystery ingredient.  The sushi chef replied that it was red snapper.  Having been given the 'green light' to consume the dish, my taste buds exploded with flavor.  The dressing was creamy and spicy, a pleasant surprise.  I was also brought a smaller 2nd salad (which contained imitation crab meat), a bowl of miso soup, and a small offering of cold edamame.  The sushi was just OK, but the abundance of free appetizers made this sushi order seem more like a bento box.",

    "text": "Proof that quantity doesn't trump quality, no matter how good the deal is.  $20 for all you can eat sushi is an impossible deal to pass up.  But take my advice and spend an extra $10 to $20 somewhere else, eat less, and be happier.  The rolls at Mido are infused with much more rice than necessary for the consumer, but just enough that the restaurant saves money on the expensive protein and fills up the customer faster.  The fish is also not very good quality.  Want to avoid the rice?  You can get a massive sashimi starter if you ask.  Don't.  It is the worst pieces of fish I've ever had.  Also mind boggling are the rolls that are on the regular menu that are not on the $20 deal.  Many of them are cheaper than the al a carte orders of what's on the all you can eat menu, but for some reason, they won't let you have these without the up charge.  Probably because they looked tastier than what's actually served.  Having said all that, I really wasn't surprised.  What was I expecting when I was paying so little?  But what really got me down was the service.  The staff is friendly, but horribly disorganized.  I was with a group of 11 and we ordered on three separate tickets.  We figured that they would bring our orders on plates that coordinated with those tickets.  We figured wrong.  They brought everything out on big boats with little rhyme or reason as to what was placed on what tray.  With some confusion, we had to ask or just taste in order to figure which roll was what.  We then explained to the server that some in our group had dietary restrictions so it was important for our next round of orders that we got we ordered on the ticket we ordered with, so that someone didn't accidentally eat something they shouldn't.  The server seemed fine with that, but when we made our second order, they once again just made a big mishmash out of it.  Thanks for listening to a simple request.  One thing that was pretty fun about Mido was the music and lights that play when there was a birthday.  Once I finally figured out what was going on, it was a lot of fun.  Way better than an annoying birthday song by the staff.",

    "text": "This is my first review and I just had to share my experience at Mido Sushi. First let me point out we went here on Christmas and we wanted to try a new place. Not many places were open for Sushi and online it said they have happy hour from 5-7.   We get there at 5:30 and right away they come out with miso soup, some ice burg lettuce in a bowl or sesame seed dressing and cold edamame. Little did I know that the complimentary food was the best tasting item! Server came by and I have a LOT of patience for servers because they don't get paid much and live on tips.   We order and she suggests a roll that was 50 cents more than the roll we have ordered at other places. She suggests the crazy roll. We get the crazy roll, two California rolls with masago, salmon sashimi and yellow tail sashimi.   The food comes out. The guy that comes to pick up some napkins and straw wrappers literally rubs his crotch up against my bf's arm and says nothing. The server never came to check on us. We had to flag her down and there wasn't busy. The crazy roll was disgusting, there was a lot of wasabi on the sashimi. I never complain but I told the server I couldn't eat the crazy roll and it was horrible ok so she decided to take it off... Thank god because it was $10.50. Oh and did I mention that it WASN'T happy hour today because it Christmas. That's the dumbest thing I have ever heard. Most people don't even go out to eat on Christmas!   So we are still hungry and I make the big mistake of ordering something else. I must be a slow learner! I should of just left. So we order the \"calamari\". When the \"calamari\" came out of the fryer and the guy from earlier comes out with it and throws it on the table. I about lost my cool but I was now making a joke of this place. I'm looking at this awkward appetizer and my bf and I are looking at it and looking at one another. We say at the same time ...What is that? Did they bring us the wrong order? It looked like 3 fat burnt chicken fingers! And then came with a sauce that tasted like BBQ sauce. What a joke. I have never ever seen calamari in that form! And I'm a sushi junkie I been to a lot of places. I never complain. I watched my bf cut it into pieces like he was slicing up a chicken finger. He attempted to pour salt on it and dip it in soy sauce. He had about 3 bites, brave guy! Later his stomach was hurting.   Total charge $33. I had no change so I paid with a $50. She brings my change a $10 bill, $5 bill and a $1. I'm so ready to leave and now I'm sitting there deciding do I leave a $6 tip or a $10 tip. I think fast and leave the $10 tip. It was Xmas and I believe in good karma. I will never go back there or ever refer someone there not even an enemy or my dog. I have no idea how that place is open. The food is horrible and the service is lacking big time. I'll stick to Sakana or I sushi or anywhere else.",

The worst thing about Midosushi is deciding between mango, azuki, or green tea ice cream (which comes with the all you can eat!).

    "text": "Mido came to me highly recommended by some friends of ours. By the end of the night he was apologizing to me, when it should have been the restaurant staff.  Our evening started smoothly enough, we had a party of 10 and they seated us promptly which was good. The waitress who came around the first time didn't understand my drink order the first time I gave it, so I repeated it and there was no further issue.  Then came time order sushi, our party was doing the all-you-can-eat deal, so we asked for separate ordering slips so we could keep the tickets separate. The waitress did not understand what we were describing to her and became flustered and panicked (English was not her first language) because they apparently keep everything on one ticket typically. Which would normally be fine, but I needed to make sure my own orders were clearly segregated because I have an avocado allergy. So the lady summoned another waiter to us and I had to explain that we wanted to keep the tickets separate and why, it was no big deal.  We ordered sushi, and for my two sons we ordered chicken dishes off the normal dinner menu. While we waited, a sweaty glass was fumbled by a combination effort of the waiter and my eldest son trying to rescue it. Nevertheless, broken glass and ice water covered my boy and our table. Waiter came back with towels to clean up, it wasn't really clear that it was anyone's fault, just frustrating.  Then our orders began to arrive. Our entire table of 10 got all of their sushi, but my boys' dinners were missing. My younger son is 3. We weren't about to eat in front of him.  HALF AN HOUR goes by and we don't have any staff visit our table...for drinks, to check on us, or anything. I flag down a girl who wasn't our waitress and try to discreetly tell her we were still waiting for two dishes for my sons.  The waiter came back a moment later and said he was sorry and that he forgot them and they'd be out in a few minutes. I was without words.  When their dinners finally arrived, my sushi had been sitting on our table for 40 minutes, and was considerably closer to room temperature than I would have liked, but I made my own decision not to eat while my children waited. The food was pretty good, not the best by a longshot, and some of their rolls are made in ways inconsistent with dozens of other sushi restaurants that I have frequented in the past. If this review were solely for the food, I would say 3.5-ish stars.  Our second order of AYCE Sushi takes a little bit long, but by this time the restaurant is crowded, and I can literally see how fast and frantic the sushi chefs are working, so I don't cause a fuss.  When the last order finally arrives, we sit and chat for another 15-20 minutes or so while no staff visit our table, we flag someone down and request the bill. Then, gold strikes and some other woman who we hadn't seen yet before comes to our table with a notepad, asking every person what they ordered before we could get the bills for our party. I bit my tongue and complied and rattled off everything I ordered, not mentioning the unacceptable delays for my childrens' dinners as I was confident someone had brought it to their attention already. But the question remained; Why were we telling them what we ordered? It wasn't \"OK who had the philly roll, ok and who had the sake bomber...?\" etc, it was \"what did you have?\" as if she had no idea and nobody wrote anything down from our original order or that the tickets that we deliberately asked them to separate so they could, you know, make this part easier for themselves, had disappeared.  Then came the bill. Full price charged for the order, even the late forgotten meals, plus 18% gratuity added on.  I walked straight to the cashier, pointed at the gratuity and said three words clearly and softly. \"Remove. This. Please.\"  I gave him my card, signed, and left.   I am beyond pissed and I am not going to return.  TL;DR: - First waitress had a panic attack over keeping my no-avocado allergy order segregated from others - Glass of water broken onto our table and my sons. - Forgot my kids' orders-were 40 minutes late to our table. - Wait staff visits to our table infrequent, often had to ask for other passers-by for assistance - Completely clueless about what our table ordered. We had to tell them everything we ordered as if the original order tickets were lost - 18% auto-tip added on when it not only shouldn't have been, but I should not have been charged for my kids dishes after having to wait to eat. - Never going back. This is not a 4-star establishment.",

I like that they automatically bring out salad, miso and edamame, although the edamame was cold and unsalted. The Sprite was good too, nice and refreshing. That's where my good comments end.   I found this place on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurants.com&s=92a32e879a8bc9bad14f389149e0a62a99ba27f54b2dca87b4d713cffa7973a9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurants.com</a>, and after checking out reviews on Yelp, I bought a $25 gift certificate for $2. But of course, you can't use the GC with their all you can eat option or with their happy hour prices. Since their happy hour goes until 10pm, and all the sushi is half price at happy hour, there's really no need for the GC. I probably spent the same amount I would have spent during happy hour anyway.   So my daughter and I go in and sit down. They don't seat you personally, they just tell you to choose a table. A couple walks in and sits down after us. We wait awhile for someone to come over and at least give us menus. Nope. I guess I was looking for too much. However, they did go over and greet the couple that came in and sat down after us -- brought them menus and drinks and everything! So someone finally comes over with our salad, miso and edamame, and then takes our drink order and gives us menus.   The food comes, and like I said, the food was actually pretty decent, which makes this 2 star rating so unfortunate. While I'm eating my sushi, my throat becomes parched because I've run out of Sprite, and no one has come over to offer to get me more. I start trying to get their attention, yet no one will even look our way. About 10 minutes later, one of the waitresses walked by -- not to check on us, just to be clear -- and we were able to grab her attention to get me another Sprite.   I would not go out of my way to go here again. However, if I happen to be in the area, am in the mood for sushi, want a good Sprite, and am mentally prepared to deal with the foolishness they call service, then I may try this place again.",

On the plus side the sushi prices are cheaper than the surrounding restaurants, which based on other reviews brought me here. I didn't have a bad experience, but I don't think I'll be back.",

I'm leaving this spot a better review than expected because of the great service and All You Can Eat for a decent price.",

It's 23.99 per person which isn't too bad when you think most rolls are about $10 each and if you get 3, you're getting your money's worth. The fish is fresh and the rolls are definitely not small so you don't feel like they're trying to skimp on the quality and quantity which is nice. I think the main sushi chef is typically there and he'll say things like \"oh chimichanga!\" and give you a nice \"Oi!\" when you walk in and this place is just cozy and friendly. I can't say anything bad at all! So glad to have found a spot like Mido!",

We sat down and the waitress approached us saying \"Just so you know we close at 9:30\" and I said \"Okay, thank you\". She came back around and said \"Just so you know, we are going to rush you.\" I looked at my friends and they were super confused and kind of annoyed she would say something like that. Since this is the place I had brought my friends to, I felt kind of responsible, and so I spoke up. I said \"oh.. well we can go somewhere else if you'd prefer. No one wants to be rushed...\" THEN. She replied in a super snooty passive aggressive tone, \"well, be nice.\" I tried to keep my cool and looked at my friends and they looked appalled that a server would say something like that to a customer. I know the owner personally, since I am a regular.. I walked up to the bar and said \"hey Pancho, our server is kind of rubbing us the wrong way.\" he said don't worry about it and to order something. i asked if there is someone else that can take care of us instead, and he said yes. I sat back down and tried to tell my friends it would all be okay, but they were appalled. We all decided it would be best to leave. I got up and said to pancho, \"i guess i'll see you here sometime with my family....thanks.\" he said goodnight and we left. so, this isn't panchos fault obviously, but if i were him  i would tell the super rude server \"you can go home if you don't want their money.\" needless to say, im never coming back here and neither is my family or friends. the good prices aren't worth feeling uncomfortable at a restaurant.",

Hostess was gracious and owner behind the sushi bar. This place maintains a highly dedicated following with locals. All you can eat option is $22...easily the best deal here given you will hit that cost basis with two rolls. Add a single starter to that and you are at $27 bucks...so go with the all you can eat. Serenity is not the name of the game as the birthday music and color lights really destroy the chi. The quality of the fish more than make up for it. Well balanced rolls and fish with enough rice to fill you but not excessive rice. Tempura, guyoza and shumai are included in AYCE. PRO TIP: non roll options here are served as two pieces. So if you write one, you get two. Just like Little Ceasers. So I wanted two masago but got four. My gal wanted two but got four. So she ate her two..... and you-know-who gets to eat six of them. These are fishy goodness but too much of anything is just too much of anything...Sushi chef missed part of our order....the unagi. The one thing on the menu that is limited to one per person per order. However we were so filled with what we ordered we were glad this did not come. All in all a good experience as good as any other sushi stuff-o-rama. Creativity is good here but sushi is sushi. Appetizers of fried calamari were the best in show. We had a couple of pieces of roll left over and the waitress didnt freak out and make us pay. We will be back many times.",

    "text": "Awesome sushi! I've been looking for a good sushi restaurant in the Chandler area. This one is my favorite so far. The price is good (Happy Hour 50% off sushi/maki essentially all the time except for Friday, Saturday night, and Sunday), you get free miso soup, salad, and edamame -- and the quality is great. Rainbow roll is my favorite. I had a sushi combo a few weeks ago, and it came with mackerel... usually I don't like mackerel because it's got a strong fishy flavor, but this was really fresh and mild and delicious. I would get it again in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "Note I used to come here alot since i was introduced to it 2 years ago. I brought friends and family here numerous times because we enjoyed good service and half way decent sushi but being AYCE it was one of the better places to go. Do not go here if you are expecting spectacular sushi remember it is AYCE. Just know I have never had an issue with them until yesterday. My family went there for Valentines day and know that they have been here before and loved it. This was one of the most horrible experiences that could have been. None of the cooked food or food that was ordered for the children, came out including the soup. They brought out the Sashimi and all of the cold sushi which was fine but when asked where the cooked food was they refused to make it until all the sushi was finished, and continued to bring out the sushi. When asked again about the rest of the food so the people who didn't like the raw food and kids could eat it ended up with the waitress ended up telling us they would not bring it out and that we were going to be charged for whatever was not finished. Now I understand charging for what was not finished but to just bring out what you are able to get done first and not bringing us the rest of our food is unprofessional and unlike what they have done in the past. After this experience it was decided my family will not come back ever again and I do not plan to bring anyone here for such horrible service. I need to find a new AYCE sushi place with half way decent sushi now. Sad because I really loved coming here and was actually here a month ago with my friend.",

We tried 4 different types of rolls and the mixed tempura and thought everything was just okay. The best thing was the dragon roll but thats pretty hard to mess up. I usually order a baked roll of some sort when I hit up a sushi joint (ca roll topped with some sort of baked seafood with dynamite sauce) and theirs was really disappointing. They really skimped out on the baked topping. The fish was average, too. I probably wont be back since there are a few other sushi places that I feel do it better.",

I lived walking distance from it for a time and I remember the location never being able to stick to a format. Prior to Mido, one restaurant after another fell over time. Mido isn't going away anytime soon from what I see.   The amount of food you can get at this place is fantastic. They start you off with a salad, miso soup and some edemame that is cold and unsalted. Edemame served that way wasn't ideal for me in my first visit, but it sure is a welcomed sight now. You get all this stuff before you even decide what you want to drink. They used to give you a 2nd salad that was an amazing serving of spiced tuna over a bed of lettuce, but those days are long gone.   The sushi has always been a great combination of the traditional along with Pancho's \"special rolls.\" If you are more in to some of the deep fried rolls (like my brother in law is) this place has you covered.  The service has never disappointed and the free Mochi iced cream is a nice touch I see other Sushi places starting to adopt.   The overall experience has always been positive going to Mido. Best place for the money hands down.   Do it.",

The sushi is always good and the prices are fair.  They now have half off happy hour twice a day.  And all you can eat sushi for 20 bucks.  Each meal is served with fresh Miso soup salad and edamame plus Green tea, Red bean, or Mango sorbet to finish your meal  complimentary, if you started with that at other sushi bars you would be in 10 dollars deep before you got to your meal.  Some of their best rolls are, Mido roll- inside is tempura shrimp, avocado, and cucumber and is topped with spicy tuna tempura flakes and ponzu sauce.  Ray roll- Inside Spicy Tuna shrimp tempura and cucumber topped with avocado and ponzu sauce.  Over all great value, good food, relaxing atmosphere.",

They have a good deal as well as I my sushi came with edamame, (sic) miso soup, salad, and green tea ice cream. We ate alot and for 2 of us it came to about $30.  I liked that alot.  The chefs and the service were very friendly.  I had a Ray Roll which was alvacado, spicy tuna, and in fact is was some of the best sushi rolls I ever had.  So why only 3 1/2 stars?  Well this will sound weak, but I just wasnt in love with the decor. The lighting is too bright and the place looks like it would just be average.  The presentation is also done on fast food trays.  It just seems for sushi that good that the ambience would go along with it.  So anyway... Try this place out.  It works very well.",

I've tried more sushi places than I care to count and Mido is by far the best. They have the best fish in town. Their all you can eat for 20 bucks is very attractive as well. I did find Sunday dinners are the freshest.  I always do the all you can eat because I get the sashimi plate. The chefs are great. If you're lucky enough to know the owner (like me!), you'll get all sorts of perks. Sashimi, items not on the menu, experimental items, it's a great perk.   The rolls are delicious, sushi is fresh and food ample. Restaurant is clean and servers can be slow when its busy but they are attentive. They used to have high turnover but for the last year or so, they've had consistent staff so good on them!  All meals come with edamame, sesame salad and miso soup. If you do all you can eat, they give you ice cream for dessert as well.",

The fresh cut rolls were pretty good I recommend the usual popular ones like California, Philadelphia, rainbow roll etc.  Service:when we first got there it was pretty empty. Maybe 3 other couples. We got seated in the corner of the restaurant near the bar so I figured Oo awesome were close to the sushi bar, that means we're getting our food quicker... Not. We ordered the first round and it took about 20 minutes to get it to our table(keep in mind there were only 3 other couples. We did 3 rounds and between each round it was a 20-25 minute wait. It got busier as time went on but the long wait seemed ridiculous.  And that's all I have to say about that.",

I've been making the pilgrimage here for several years and each time it's been consistently good. All-you-can-eat sushi, made to order, with a variety of different rolls included along with soup, salad, edamame -- and sashimi and ice cream for dessert if you request them.  For non-sushi eaters (poor things), they do a great job with tempura, gyoza, and teriyaki chicken and beef. They also have a wide variety of drink specials (sake bomb for $6.00!).  The staff is efficient and friendly. And if it's someone's birthday, the disco ball gets lit up to celebrate!",

    "text": "I've been coming here for at least 8 years now and usually do the ayce sushi which has a ton of different rolls you can choose from! It's nice that the ayce option includes tempura, a little salad, miso soup, a plate of sashimi, and ice cream for dessert! Just a warning, the ayce is not ayce sashimi but includes a plate that scales with however many people you have. It is unfortunate they raised the price from 19.99 to 21.99 because now the cost is 25+ with tip and tax vs. A price south of 25 which makes me feel like it's alot more expensive even that's it's just $2 more! Most the rolls here are pretty good and I enjoy the dragon roll, caterpillar, Pancho, mido, and soft shell crab roll amongst many others! I would not recommend the avocado roll cause it's literally just avocado and rice... My challenge when I get the ayce is to order enough to get the sushi delivered in a boat, and while many attempts have been made, only a few have come to fruition!   This used to be my go to sushi place but then I discovered Akita sushi which has a 11.99 lunch buffet, however it is a bit far from chandler(it's in Scottsdale) and it doesn't come with sashimi for lunch. If it's your birthday they have a disco ball and flashing lights that come out that's always fun!",

Personally this is my major sticking point as the price of most sushi A La Carte can get expensive before you're even satisfied. So as a general rule I don't go to Sushi joints unless its AYCE and that is what my review will focus on.   The Salmon and Albacore are great, very fresh and melts like butter in your mouth! They have lots of good standard Sushi fare, Tuna, Spicy scallops, crab and eel, and some more unique stuff like Ikura (Salmon Eggs) Squid and Octopus. Most of their rolls are variations on some classics and they sometimes aren't too different from each other save for one or two ingredients, the roll selection is still great.   The place is always crowded even during lunch but during evenings you will have to wait in like for up to 20 minutes, even for a bar seat. seems like everyone else knows its that good and at such a steal of a price.  The overall waitressing is fine, though if they are busy it might take a few minutes to refill your drink.  and the time from getting your sushi varies from how busy the place is to what kind of sushi you got ex. Barbecue Eel usually takes five minutes longer than most sushi as its cooked.  Overall the value is great, the food is worth the trip to the south chandler area. service is satisfactory. This is our go to place for nice dinners out to having lunch with friends. highly recommend.",

They had a all you can eat for $25.99 deal so we decided to try it. We ended up ordering four rolls and two orders of eel nigiri. We were excited for our rolls but all of them left us leaving the restaurant unsatisfied. Also for an all you can eat menu, you would expect all you can eat. The eel nigiri was the only good thing we had ordered cause it was warm and pretty large but unfortunately there was a limit which was one order per person so like what? Hence why we only got 2 orders. There was nothing wrong with the service but I would say the food quality wasn't there.",

All the rolls were good but I have to say that the nigiri was really good all the fish was fresh and it was about twice the size that you normally get elsewhere.  Getting drinks was a bit slow but other than that it was a great find that I will be going back to often.

Great sushi options, I'd definitely recommend the cone shaped sushi (apologies, forgot the terms) and you can't go wrong with any typical choices. The food tastes good and they make the perfect ratio of ingredients vs sushi rice, making the most out your experience instead of stuffing you with mostly rice (to get you full faster I'm assuming). The staff there are great and will keep you satisfied. Keep in mind, the kitchen will close earlier than closing time so they will ask you for any last requests when that time comes. Yet, they were very patient with us when we stayed a little over 30 minutes finishing our meals, we didn't feel rushed! Overall, I definitely recommend this place over the Phoenix and Scottsdale equivalents.",

The owners daughters are always so nice when they greet customers and I love family owned mom and pops restaurants. Great blend of neighborhood feel with the right amount of professionalism! Love it!",

More likely than not, we'll opt for the all you can eat option for $20/ person.   With that comes with miso soup, salad, sashimi, your AYCE picks, ice cream and with a special frequent customer request, this awesome pan seared, naturally fatty sea bass belly and salmon cheeks, which are AMAZING. Not a taste for everyone, kinda bizarre for most. But this will be well appreciated by traditional Asian taste and PERFECT for me. Loyalist here.",

Going for lunch or dinner is easy and quick. They have plenty of seating, even for larger groups. The sushi come out in large boats that are great for sharing amongst the table. If you're alone the sushi bar is a great option, although it can get crowded between your drink, sushi, and sides.",

    "text": "Okay so I made two visits here, so far. And yes, I will be going back.  Visit #1 - Dinner time I wasn't sure what to expect. When you first enter, they acknowledge your presence and ask you to seat yourself. A server then comes and takes your drink order. I ordered the green tea, which, by the way, is literally green. It is yummy. So, then another server comes out with Miso soup, crab salad and green beans. These come with any order for free. So after eating the yummy free stuff, I was ready for sushi. You can either order by the roll, or get all you can eat for $19.95. So, since I was ordering 2 rolls that added up to $18, I went with the all you can eat. I ordered the Vegas Roll, Soft Shell Crab roll and the Crazy Roll. They were all very delicious. And they staggered the delivery of the rolls. I was with my kids so I got them some ice cream. No complaints about the service or food!  Oh and when you get the all you can eat, you get a free appetizer. So, I picked the dumplings which they serve pan fried.  Visit #2 - Lunch time So, my expectations were set to order a couple rolls that cost around $12. Well, wouldn't ya know it they have a lunch time special where all rolls are half off. I ordered 5 rolls for $20 (lunch was for 2). They have special menus pre planned for the all you can eat and half off lunch specials, but if there is a roll that isn't on the list, for the most part you can ask and they will make it. Just make sure to tip the chef. I ordered my usual rolls plus the dragon roll. Yummy!",

    "text": "I trust Yelp... so when I see 4 stars, I think \"alright... that's going to be good!\"  Four of us went during their happy hour (which is really the entire day Mon-Thurs) at 7 p.m. and shared 4 rolls.  It came with complimentary soup and salad and a plate of semi-warm edamame.  The soup was pretty much just a broth and the salad was a watery-asian dressed sampler.  The sushi?  It just was not quality.  And the thing is -- I am NOT picky with sushi!  But I sat there eating it and immediately thinking how it distinctly did not taste fresh.  By no means was it awful, but the one fried roll we ordered had a particular taste that made me feel like it had been reheated.  You know when the dough of something freshly fried is crispy and crunchy?  But if you reheat it that item later the crisp is a lot softer?  That's what it felt like.  The service wasn't any better either.  The one great thing that really blew me away was that our total came out to $15.  For FOUR!  That's a little over $5 each for dinner.  So at least the price reflected it.  But honestly, I don't care to pay more for sushi because that is one thing I don't want to risk not being fresh -- raw fish.  When I left I made a silent prayer that my stomach would not be regretting this later.  Fortunately, I am not sick and totally capable of writing this review 12 hours later.  My overall take: Meh.",

    "text": "Most sushi places end up with a bill with around $15-30/person depending on how much you order or where you go.  Unless you are going to be planning on eating a second dinner or drinking a lot, usually you need more food afterwards to settle your stomach.  Mido sushi has all you can eat $20 sushi.  I have been to places like this, such as Todai.  The significant difference between Mido and Todai is that they ask you what you want to order and it is freshly made.  The all you can eat also comes with a soup, salad, tempura, edamame, hot tea, and ice cream (get the mango, has a few chunks of real mango).  I didn't waste too much space other than the sushi, and that is what I recommend if you want to get a bang for your buck.  I think between the 4 of us, we ordered around 25 rolls of sushi.  As much as the sushi was excellent, the service is a hit or miss depending on the mood of the servers.  I think last night was a good night, but I have heard they can be crabs.  I also heard they actually ask you why you don't tip at least 15%.  In my opinion, even though tip is very standardized, I still feel you have to earn your tip.  My standard is 20% for far exceeding service, 15% for great service, and 12% for average service, 10% or sometimes less for poor service.  When we entered, they had a disco ball and some music playing for someone's birthday.  They should have had the \"Celebration\" theme song after the amount of sushi we chowed down!",

A great price yet the quality is what you pay for and the menu is restricted to the first two pages for sushi rolls along with some nigri selections.  It comes with a cup of miso soup (terrible) and a side salad (iceberg lettuce with their house dressing), choice of gyoza or tempura (very greasy) and a few ice cream selections. There are restrictions on eating everything you order (including the thick rice served with your nigiri selection) otherwise you will be charge for it.  If you don't want the all you can eat sushi then they do have a number of different sushi rolls to choose from around $8.50-$9.50 a roll. You can order a large beer and small sake for $6 so if you just want to grab a drink, then go this route.  I had better hot sake but it's more economically to get the sake bomber if you want a large imported beer (rarely can you go wrong with bottle beer).  I gave this restaurant a 3 star, not for the food, but the service was friendly and it was minimum wait time on a Friday.",

    "text": "Years later and this is still my favorite sushi place. The hubby and I just had another fantastic dinner here last night and so I thought it was time to write an update.   My favorite fried rolls are the Las Vegas which has a ton of flavor and comes with a yummy sweet sauce drizzled on top and the calamari roll which actually is not fried but the squid inside is. This one tastes really great if you add a little dollop of sirracha hot sauce to it. I usually try to limit us to either one or the other so that we don't get too much fried in one meal so last night we went with the calamari and also our other usual maki. The one with the three different kinds of fish (Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail) is delicious. You get so much fish and it is always such good quality and so fresh tasting! I also love the Tucson roll and last night we added cream cheese to it just to make things a little more interesting. It was perfect! I am a huge shrimp fanatic so this one is just really tasty. I also like to order the cucumber roll. My husband does not eat cucumber so I have to consume the entire roll myself but it is just so fresh and light that this is not a problem. I love the crunch of the cucumber... and it goes so well with wasabi and ginger flavors! Just delicious.   To top it all off, they still include salad, miso soup and edamame with every meal. All this food plus two ice teas (mine was green tea and soooo good) and the bill for the two of us came to about $15. All the rolls were from the half price happy hour menu, which they have now extended to 10pm on Mon-Thurs. Just amazing prices! The place is so casual and comfortable that is has become my favorite place to go when I get home from work too tired to cook. And the staff is so friendly! They really know how to treat their regulars well.   Next time you are in the area and in the mood for sushi, skip all the gimmicky chains or glitzy, expensive sushi bars and come here for some down-home good food and great service.",

First of all, knowing every other time we have gone it's been busy and we have to sit at the sushi bar, I called ahead to make sure we could have a table--sure, no problem. Next, however, they did something I thought would have been impossible to explain over the phone-- I requested pre ordered adult beverages be delivered to our table upon arrival, to surprise my fiance for his bday celebration (he's not one to go out of his way to order an adult beverage while we out, so i took the liberty of doing it for him [insert evil laugh here] ) and they did just that...right on queue :)  Ordering and receiving was a breeze as per usual, and everything was fresh and delicious. When it was about time to bring the check, our server attempted to ask if we wanted dessert to celebrate, but fiance was on the phone....next thing we know (he had hung up by this time) disco lights are flashing, Asian techno music sounding similar to happy birthday was playing on a speaker above us, and out came our server with some mango ice cream w/ a candle in it. To top it off, the entire restaurant was clapping and she shot a confetti popper in the air too!   This was by far the best night we've had in such a long time, and we owe it all to Mido! THANKS AGAIN!",

The service is great and the sushi chefs are HILARIOUS! if you go in, tell them its your birthday! you will LOVE the surprise!  The place inside isn't all that great, and the servers have a difficult time understanding what you want. The 19.99 all you can eat deal is amazing though! Make sure you order sashimi if you're trying to get any fish at all... because like I said earlier, their rolls are more rice than anything!  Always remember, you get what you pay for!",

Seafood quality has been superb 99% of the time. I was served some uni once that tasted awful. I mentioned it to the server yet I was still charged and no apology was given.   This would be five stars but for the uni experience, and also on occasion, the rice amounts increase (with a corresponding decrease of the seafood portion) when doing all you can eat and ordering A LOT of food.",

The kama is crisp on the outside and lusciously velvety goodness on the inside.  The sashimi is divine and melts in your mouth.  The salmon rolls are quite tasty too, if you're in the mood for sushi.   On the other hand, I'm not  a big fan of their non-salmon sushi, and the seaweed salad is a little underseasoned.    Anything fried is good though - soft shell crab, tempura, etc.    There's all you can eat for $20, but with almost every hour of every day being half-off happy hour, there's always a good deal to be had here ;)  [Additionally, they have listings on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> too]",

For my friends that don't eat as much as I do the happy hour menu works great. Great quality product, I have found it always consistent. I eat mostly sushi/sashimi and occasionally a roll. I do wish they had a wider variety of fish to sample and uni is usually in short supply. That being said even the higher end joints have sure cut back in this economy.   I like the costumer service, no not the fastest in the world. Pancho makes sure the food gets out, and if it isn't correct he'll fix it.   Drink prices are good if you like sake and beer, which I do. Sake Bomb large beer/small sake ($6).  This is your 5 star (working middle class) sushi bar.",

Being a petite girl, I don't have the stomach capacity to make proper use of their All You Can Eat deal, but if you're a person who can eat a lot, do it. During busy dinnertime, the service isn't great - you're going to have to flag the waitresses down for your order and check, though they're good about refilling drinks - but I would honestly chalk that up to Asian custom, since in my experience, waiters and waitresses in restaurants overseas are not big on hovering at your table. Going during lunch time is a treat, because then the waitresses are nicer and the chefs take good care of you. I really recommend this place if you're looking for some quality sushi on a budget.  Do take the time to chat with the chefs if you're sitting at the bar and ask them what they'd recommend (so much variety - try new things!), because they're really nice and helpful and might even treat you to a new bite or two.",

Sushi in the desert is an anachronism at best and good sushi is usually an often spoken but rarely achieved thing.  Mido delivers very good sushi. When you combine that with the all you can eat option, you have a great experience.  Most all you can eat sushi is a horror or a test of wills between you and the chef as to whether you can out last his infinitesimally slow delivery.   Mido staff are cheerful and the chefs are adept at providing tasty well done rolls and sashimi quickly without fuss.  If you are jonesing for some very tasty sushi and a lot of it, I highly recommend Mido",

At the end, of you have enough room for it, you get little cold cup of ice cream which is always a nice little treat! I've had both the mango and the green tea flavors, both delicious :)",

I lived in Asia for quite some time and I think it's one of the few places in Phoenix that is comparable. Always been very grateful that they take such good care in preparing the meals as well. We live right behind Mido's now so we still order to go from them more than a couple of times a week when we don't go in. Hands down my favorite place to eat.

They have an okay selection for AYCE - mostly cooked rolls, I would prefer more fresh rolls. I don't know if its because I didn't ask or because they don't offer it but I don't think they have handrolls, I would totally like one or two!  Some of my favorite was the mido roll and the dragon roll. The rolls are decently sized with not too much rice. Their nigiri though is a little heavy on the rice. Spicy scallop is a big no because its cold cook scallop which felt a little weird.  I feel like I don't eat my monies worth for AYCE but I just love the idea of getting ALL the sushi I want.   Sashimi is also available on AYCE but only limited to a portion per person.",

    "text": "LOVE THIS PLACE. Are the happy hour rolls as extravagant as Akai Hana's HH? Debatable but leaning towards no. However, because Akai Hana is so far from my little Tempe residence, Mido Sushi is the answer to my (sushi) prayers.  Happy Hour is Monday-Thursday ALL DAY, and Friday-Saturday from 11:30-5pm. Because I'd never get my money's worth for the $23.99 buffet, I really appreciate their happy hour menu, where all rolls are 50% off.  My boyfriend get the buffet while I order a la carte from the HH menu, and life is good.  Service is super fast and the venue is nice. It's not a super bougie restaurant but much nicer than you'd expect from AYCE.  At first sight, the Pancho Roll is disappointingly small. But when I actually tried it, I discovered what the hype is all about - IT'S GOOD. The Las Vegas roll was decent, but not as good as Sushiholic's Vegas roll.  Mido Sushi is definitely going to be a weekly staple for the boothang and I. We're still sitting in the restaurant and we're already planning the next time we want to come back.  So pleased to have found this sushi joint. I'm planning on trying the Dragon Roll next time, and a handful of other rolls caught my eye.",

I was never asked if I wanted another beer. Which to me is something all servers should do.   The rolls were okay. They tasted as if all they had was cream cheese and cucumbers. I've had better at buffets.  It's strange that they have carpet throughout the restaurant. I'll go back since it's close by. Maybe I'll check out happy hour next time.",

    "text": "At 24$, I don't recommend getting AYCE unless you can eat a lot. The sushi here is OK. The chefs are Korean so unsurprisingly the sushi looks and tastes more like Kimbab, which might not be a bad thing since this means a greater fish to rice ratio, whereas other places have a lot of rice and no fish.   Service is also OK. The biggest con is they require you to put everyone's order on one sheet of paper. When I asked if we could separate them, the waitress was reluctant and said the orders would come out at different times. So when the food came out it's hard to remember who ordered what. Also our order came out wrong with some nigiri missing. After reordering, it still didn't come out after waiting a long time so we canceled our order after being told it was still thawing. Overall I would probably come here once in a while since they have a good amount of fish.",

I was amazed and incredibly happy with how great the food was and the price can't be beat anywhere else!!! We got 6 rolls of sushi, REAL wasabi (most places serve \"watered\" down wasabi to save on money since it's so expensive), fresh ginger, one black iced tea, and one green iced tea and it TOTAL it cost us $25.66! With a tip of $5 the whole meal cost us $30.66 in total and I. WAS. STUFFED! Not only was the food amazing, but the staff was sooo nice and incredibly attentive! My drink was refilled 3 times and I never saw the waitress come by and fill it she was so quiet and fast about it! The other not flattering reviews seem to be talking about soup, salad, and other meals you can get in the restaurant - and I can't vouch for those items as I've only had the sushi - but it IS called Mido SUSHI and I can honestly tell you the Sushi is fantastic! Plus i would like to mention I don't like raw fish and there are still a TON of options to try that does not include raw fish....even on the Sushi menu....plus you can't beat ALL DAY happy hour Monday-Thursday! I can not recommend this place more highly!!! I will definitely be coming back here...soon!",

Meal comes with salad, miso, and ice cream to finish it off (green tea is my favorite).  Be sure to order the sashimi plate prior to your rolls.  You will not regret it. Best cuts of a variety of premium fish all served atop a bed of shredded radish. The staff is very friendly. Be sure to tip your sushi chefs handsomely at the end of your meal. By the time you finish your meal, you will agree that they earned it! This place can get very busy and they do not do reservations. Please plan accordingly! It is well worth the wait. :) They do have happy hour and serve standard dishes if you are not into sushi.",

    "text": "I think I found my new \"go to\" sushi place.  I visited Mido with my husband the other day based on a friend's recommendation and I am so glad I did.    My husband and I both had the all-you-can-eat sushi for $20.  As Jared said, the sushi quality is not out of this world, but it is solid (good).  Definitely a great deal for the price.   It is comparable to Takamatsu's all-you-can-eat, but I think I prefer Mido.  Like Takamatsu, the sushi is made to order and not pre-made, which is a huge plus!   There is a large list of rolls you can choose from and the buffet also comes with:  Edamame Miso soup Assorted tempura or gyoza (I recommend the tempura) Sashimi platter (If you love raw fish, do NOT miss out on this) Ice cream (mango, green tea, or red bean)  All the above is brought to you.  You can also ask for fixings for Korean style sashimi lettuce wraps (ssam, samjang, chojang).  If you love spicy, garlicky, fresh, crispy, food, I highly recommend it.  Oh and for dessert, try the red bean paste ice cream at least once.  You won't be disappointed.  All three flavors are really good, but the red bean one is the best in my opinion.  The flavors are really delicate with a hint of what tastes like rose water.  Seriously, it is really good.  Refreshing too.  A great way to finish off a great dinner.     I'm not sure if you can forgo any of the above, and I will mention that like other all-you-can-eat sushi places you will be charged if you do not finish all the food you ordered, which makes total sense.  Waste is not a good thing.  So, I recommend you take your time, just order a few things at first and order more once you finished what you have already ordered.  All-in-all this is good food and great service at a very reasonable price.  Everything about it, from the enthusiastic greeting you get from the sushi master/owner to the the generous and delicious offerings for dinner, tells you that this is a place with heart.  The priority here is to make sure you have a great experience and it totally shows!",

Tonight - White Tuna Albacore, Octopus, Shrimp Roll w it's head fried, Squid Salad, miso soup, edamame, and my nemesis Uni!  I can't handle Uni -- the texture really throws me off and the taste of the ocean from a slimy gushy slab of Sea Urchin is not fun for my palate!  Everything else works, definitely loving the Octopus with a thinly slice of lemon on top - Yum!  Plus, gotta say my all time favorite is the fried shrimp head -- Yes, Andrew Zimmerman would be proud of me.  Service was excellent.  I got a tip of the hat from the Sushi Master -- I hope that's a good thing.  Overall they were attentive and quick.  The decors were traditional Japanese and what you would expect from a small sushi joint.  Definitely, think an anime flare would do it some good haha!  Dragon Ball Z, Gundam, and some Escaflowne would give it some up to date generational kick! - Enjoy!",

The all-you-can-eat menu is extensive and really anything you could want, same goes for the happy hour menu. If you are not some sushi purist or elitist get their vegas roll it's deep fried seafood heaven on a roll definitely recommend it. Their rolls are rather large. If you are not very hungry (sushi in general never tends to fill me if I order a la carte) one roll per person can actually make an impact at this place where most other restaurants will require much more.   Why not five stars? Well it's a value proposition not a hip date place or cool place to meet up with friends. Service is great though, just not the ideal atmosphere.",

Our server had a very negative attitude and rarely came back to check on us. my server took away my tofu bowl when I was still working on it. I'm not sure if I will get a better experience if I go back again, but I'm not sure I'd go back just because of the service and the feeling we were rushed. Overall service is 1-2 stars.  Bottom line is maybe it's just isolated experience but although my food was decent, the service really killed the night.",

    "text": "I went to this sushi bar last week for happy hour with my mother directly after work due to rave reviews. While the sushi was pretty good and I liked the sushi chefs, the overall customer service was HORRIBLE!   I walked in and stood at the front and the waitress was leaning against the sushi bar across the room looking at me. She didn't walk up to say hello, nor did she direct me to an available table. So after standing around for a few mins I walked over TO her and she looked and spoke to me like I was disturbing her. I had to ask for a menu and she simply shook her hand towards the dining area when I asked for a table.   I eventually sat down at the sushi bar and waited for my mother, we ate, enjoyed the sushi but the salad (topped with a small strip of fake crab meat) and edamame (sp?) left much to be desired. When we finished our meal, oh and no one checked on us either, we sat there for 15-20 mins and no one acknowledged us. We were sitting right next to the kitchen doors so the waitresses had to walk past us to get to the rest of the customers.   I'm not sure if I'm the only customer that received this kind of treatment but I did notice the waitresses being pleasant to the people around us. As well as walking them to available tables with menus in hand.  When we paid, I wrote a note complaining about the service and intend on speaking to the manager, but I doubt that would make any difference.   I will never visit this sushi place nor would I recommend it to my large social circle.",

We had 3 options: 1.- happy hour menu 2.- all you can eat menu ($25 per person) 3.- regular menu  The only caveat is the \"all you can eat\" option has rules: -No take out - left over food will be charged - cant share with this option   We opted for happy hour specials since we were on a crunch time to get to the movie theater.   The service and the food were both amazing! Cant say enough good things about this place.  I had tea, a gyoza sushi roll and the deep fried asparagus & crab meat roll. Highly recommend!",

If you really want to have AYCE sushi and you don't have any other options unless you drive far, then this place will be fine but don't get excited.  This is no joke, they have a machine that makes the nigiri rice and the pieces are too big and condensed (machine compressed), mind you the fish you get is of good portion but the rice is huge. Serious, you'll see two machines that tower over the sushi bar.  If you're a sushi snob I would not recommend this place to you but if you just want to feed your gut with average fish and lots of rice than this is the place for you. Note picture, thick cuts but condensed rice underneath, smart tactic.  The sushi chefs and all the servers seem very nice, they have Soju, Saki and beer.",

Solid 4-stars for the sashimi but 3-stars for the nigiri and rolls.   First of all, the sashimi was crazy good. We're talking thick cuts of good quality fish that is still glistening from the freshness. The salmon with all the beautiful marbling alone was spectacular. David K K. told me about asking for sashimi and I was so enraptured with the salmon that I forgot to ask for the gochujung and lettuce wraps. Amazing. As for the nigiri, the yellowtail wasn't bad but get that red snapper away from me. That snapper snapped back. I couldn't even bite through it! This place does utilize the method of putting a huge hunk of rice to fill you up. It worked. I was so full off of one round. I will say the rice seemed to be seasoned fairly lightly.  All in all, it's a pretty solid place that gets the job done. $25.99 for AYCE. Go in and enjoy the sashimi plate, just don't expect too much with the other cuts of fish. I would come back for the sashimi but pass on their nigiri and maki rolls.",

    "text": "This restaurant is located fairly close to home so it's a convenient place to stop when I'm in the mood for sushi. I've been a fan of Pancho since he was head chef at Sushi Hama in Tucson.  Pros: I arrived in the early evening on a Saturday as was immediately able to find a seat at the bar. My initial orders were ready within about the next 10 minutes.  The most obvious difference about this restaurant compared to most other sushi restaurants we visit is the noticeably larger portion sizes of the fish and other ingredients relative to the rice (see photographic evidence below). I suppose some sushi aficionados will argue about the pieces of fish needing to be the proper size, thickness, etc. when preparing nigiri. However, for me it's the sight of a nice, large slice of well marbled salmon on a ball of rice that really whets my appetite.  The maki rolls are also very generous in size as well as quantity and variety of ingredients.  All of the fish tasted as fresh as one could expect at a sushi restaurant in Arizona.  Cons: Although the consistency of the rice was very good, I would have preferred more sugar and vinegar seasoning.  The price for all-you-can eat is a bit higher than most other sushi restaurants we visit regularly. However, given the generous portions I would say it is still worth the price when we're in the mood to treat ourselves to some good sushi.  Photo Design By: Billie Z.",

The service is always quick and friendly and the family working the restaurant has a wealth of experience. They started in Tucson with a similar place and are now in Chandler. The fish is very fresh here and the favor is a ways in tact. I'm a fan of octopus and normally this is a good indicator of the calibur of sushi that is being served. Typically it can be tough and gummy, but at Mido, never an issu. When you're leaving Pancho the head sushi chef is sure to close the visit with his signature. \"Thank you very much!\"",

Starter for all - cold edamame.  We prefer a nice hot batch.  Cold just tastes like a beanstalk. Now we never go into a new place ordering tons Incase, good call in these situations.  1) Gyoza (deep fried pork dumpling) was awesome and crunchy (which u don't see a lot of and was nice tasting) but could barely find the meat.  It was attached to a fresh spice! Mostly chestnuts I believe.  Dipping sauce, about a tablespoon for 6 small pieces.  Just tasted like vinegar.  2) California roll (now it's $3 so don't expect much) the nori was edible so good on that, but the Kano/crab was fishy.  If it was real makes sense but it was probably the fake crab in that case ????  It was light of veg but what do you want for $3!  Out of banana tempura....(sad face)  First and last time for us.",

    "text": "I took my daughter out for her 17th birthday with some of her friends. We eat sushi often and wanted to try a new place. My daughter requested sushi for her special lunch and Mido was also recommended to me by a friend. I called ahead to see if I needed a reservation.  The woman on the phone said yes and took my my name as \"Josh\" when I told her Jocelyn. I was under the impression that this would be a slightly more upscale establishment than we were used to, so to my surprise,  it was anything but. We walked in the door and the place was completely empty! Not sure why I needed that reservation I had called in just hours earlier. One of our friends was already seated so we just joined her. We were immediately bombarded with menus and order sheets. We had not even sat down yet. The waitress was not friendly at all, asking repeatedly for our drink order while we were all trying to say hello to each other. We put in the order for drinks and thought we could chat for a sec. Nope, interrupted another 3 times wanting our order.  We ordered the calamari as an appetizer. And a various assortment of sushi and an udon bowl. The calamari came out looking like chicken strips. Hmmm I had never seen calamari like this. It was ok, very chewy. Our main course was delivered shortly after. It looked like sushi but the tuna was a dark orange color. I have always experienced a nice bright pink/majenta color.  We all began eating and soon found ourselves looking at each other in disappointment. The sushi just was not flavorful. It was bland and seemed just not to taste right. It didn't smell or taste like it was rotten. We couldn't put our finger on it, it just wasn't good. Our lunch was pretty much over. None of us finished our food. They had our plates cleared in a matter of seconds not bothering to ask how the food was. The establishment was run down and old looking.  One of the girls got stuck in one of the bathroom stalls due to the lock not working properly. We really couldn't leave fast enough. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",

Now to explain why not the full fantastic five stars. If I could have given them an extra half star I would. I would have wanted to see more nigiri  or sashimi than California Rolls. It did taste pretty amazing, something I don't often want to admit about California Rolls. Kinda like being in the closet about liking science fiction movies or video games.  Now I know I ordered Boat, it's a cheesy move, but it's Boat..!!!....BOAT.!!..it comes on a Boat. Oh, and yes I consumed it all on my own with pride of a conquering overlord. This was entry level Boat it's level Boat 1, hopefully in the coming weeks I'll defeat the game bosses and level up to Boat 4 while playing hidden levels of miso soup and teriyaki chicken.  There's always gonna be the folks that say \"I don't eat sushi here in the valley, it's just not fresh.\" Exactly and if it was even in a coastal city, you would be paying a small fortune. Well it has been said by Sushi Master Yasuda that there's no flavor in fresh fish.  I'm fortunate where I work it's convenient to deviate here for a delicious meal after the grind is finished.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been coming here for 10 years. That's all the way back to when we first started dating. A lot of great warm memories there; including getting my roommate hooked on sushi there. We got married through our years of eating there. The head chef was and is still polite.       There is a big but coming and here it is. Over the years, they began to get slower with their service. And not just on Saturday prime nights but lunch time when there was pretty much us and another couple. A lot of times they would forget the order all together or replace an order with someone else we didn't order. And sometimes, we would have multiple waitresses ask if we had wanted to order long after placing a order with another staff member. Last night was no different. I will admit and man up that I misread the menu and ordered double the nigiri. I totally deserved to pay the extra but not over $57 more for roughly half an orders worth left over. KEEP READING. If you put a 1 on the AYCE menu for sake aka salmon nigiri, it actually means two pieces. I thought it was one for one. Honest mistake there. I ordered 8 White albacore, 8 yellow tail and 8 salmon nigiri and a roll of Philadelphia roll plus whatever my wife and friend ordered. So what I actually ordered was the Philly roll plus 48 vs 24 nigiri that i thought I had ordered. I finished around 30 Nigiri plus my Philly Roll and then some of my wife's and friends plate. This means there was 18 nigiri left, 7 pieces sashimi. Not nearly a whole order. Here is where it was out of my hands. Instead of getting the 8 orders of Salmon Nigiri which I know I definitely ordered as I did the other 8 Yellow tail and white tuna, the salmon was replaced by more white tuna and yellow tail. That was the first mistake. BIG mistake given we wwaited and it finally came 40 minutes later and wrong. The sashimi came out last. For years, they usually serve it first. I had to ask twice for it to be served. The chef behind the counter (not the main head chef who greets you in Korean, again nice guy and very polite - the other older chef) was rude and kept muttering things under his breathe in a harsh tine while looking at me. His attitude was terrible. This was right after I had asked for the second time and after about 40 minutes of waiting there for my sashimi to come. We get the bill and they charged us $57 dollars more! that is about 3 AYCE amounts more and the left overs we had (as stated earlier above) was not nearly that price. I think it was outrageous to charge us half an orders of sushi (again look above for leftovers) at 3 x the amount. I could have easily slowly put the sushi and left overs in a napkin rolled it up and threw it away in the back of the bathroom, but that is not the kind of people we are. We are honest and have been coming there for years. At the same time, do not use that opportunity to severely abuse over charging a 3 -10 year customers that will not come back again. That is abuse of power. Again I mentioned that I made a reckless mistake, but whoever decided to charge us half an orders worth leftovers at 3 x the amount, you just abused all three of us and shame on you for that. There really is no way to fully make up for this, but if you (as in whoever was the executive decision maker in over charging us that absurd amount) have any decency as a business, refund us at least 2 whole orders worth. This is the kind of thing that promotes dishonesty because the next person that reads this will probably just throw all how ever many pieces of sushi away and not deal with the potential overcharge. They will instead lie, and that is wrong, but that is what this situation reinforced. I will still say that if I did it over again, I would still be honest. The question now lies, how will you somewhat make up for this atrocious taking advantage of us as customers? Completely unacceptable.",

All the reviews say it comes with other stuff but ours just came with salad and soup, no appetizer or ice cream. The sake was good but not great, the other times I have had it, they were really smooth and good and this just wasn't. I am by no means an expert or know one sake from another but this was not like the other ones I have had. I wouldn't go back here on purpose. There is a lot better tasting stuff around.

Generous cuts and the guys making the sushi are very friendly.  If they could improve the decor a little, and get more consistent with service, they would be 5 star for sure.",

We opted for ayce which we thought would be a good deal, but the menu was somewhat limited. Kids under 12 were their age plus $2 so come prepared for that. Adults were $24. I got sick after our first round... not sure what I ate, but my stomach started hurting pretty quickly. Besides that, the food was mediocre at best. Even the miso soup didn't have any seaweed or tofu. The best roll I had was the pancho but I didn't eat my $24 worth for sure. Staff was nice and bathrooms were decent (I know cuz I had to frequent several times). And the place needs some energy! Turn on some music or something. Definitely won't be back.",

    "text": "I wish I could give Mido a higher review. I used to like coming here; it has a GREAT value; happy hour all day on weekdays; free miso soup, salad, and edamame with your meal; pretty decent sushi, like the Pancho Roll; and really friendly chefs. I used to really enjoy Mido as a family restaurant with a nice atmosphere.  So I took some friends with me the other day when I took a trip down there. Some of friends were guys who love sushi and can eat a LOT, so they got the 20$ all-you-can-eat special (which is a really good deal). It was a disappointing experience. The sushi was very sloppily prepared and the quality of taste was none too great either. This would have been excusable, because for 20$ all you can eat, you can't really expect 5 star sushi every time. However, our biggest complaint was with the service.  There's a waitress there, an older Asian woman, who was very abrupt and brusque. Some of our friends arrived a few minutes later then the rest of us, and she took a long time coming back to our table, even though the restaurant was empty. So the rest of us had our appetizers, edamame, soup, and drinks; she came back a few times to see if we were ready to order our sushi but paid no attention to the newcomers who were lacking in drinks or any of the other stuff. Finally, when we were giving her our sushi orders, I politely pointed out that our friends hadn't gotten their drinks yet. She replied rudely, \"Yeah, I know, I already know that,\" and just walked off.  Okay, not too big of a deal. So she brings us our stuff and my friends order their first round of all-you-can-eat-sushi. They finish it off and we're given the same ticket that we marked our orders on the first time. My friends thought this would be confusing, so when they were writing down their second orders (on the same ticket that still had our first), they put darkened circles next to the second orders. The waitress took the ticket without looking at it or pausing to confirm and just whisked off.  Lo and behold, the order she brought back was the exact same rolls they had ordered the first time, not the ones they wanted to try for their second round. When we told her what had happened, she responded with extreme impatience and annoyance, pretty much just blaming us. Our friends didn't really want to eat the same rolls they had just had, so they asked her what they should do, because they were also hesitant to waste it. She said that we should just eat what we had ordered, so they were forced to eat the exact same rolls a second time.  So then they ordered a third time, because there were still rolls they wanted to try and they had paid for all you can eat. When they told our waitress that they were ready to order a third round, she acted as if we were being absurd for wanting more. She was even ruder and more abrupt and snatched the ticket out of our hands. The more sushi we ordered, the more irritated she seemed to get. Are we not supposed to order all you can eat for the all you can eat deal?...  Anyway, it was just a really unpleasant experience because of the service. The sushi was just okay, 3 stars at best, but there is a good variety of rolls at Mido that we unfortunately felt unable to try because it was like we were being persecuted for wanting to order more. Every \"round\" of ordering was only three or four rolls, two per person, so it wasn't like we were just marking up every roll on the list and stuffing our faces and eating the restaurant out of house and home. We never want to go back here, which makes me sad, because I used to really love Mido.",

We were greeted right away with a good waitress, but somehow I found her voice was really annoying! The food came out after 10minutes and I was disappointed with the sashimi! It wasn't as fresh as I expected. The soy sauce tasted very weird and too salty. By far this is not the most decent sushi restaurant I've experienced.  Kabuki and Masa sushi are still my best choice so far.",

Actually, I saw one of the guys who was making the sushi cut into an avacado, and I guess there was something about it he didn't like so he threw the whole thing away.  Heck, I think I would have at least looked further to see if there was some part that was good.  So point being that they don't pass off bad food.  I'll definitely go back if I'm in that area.

The value is phenomenal, where can two people get miso soup, salad, beans, tea, ice cream and sushi rolls all for under $20?   I've tried the same at Say Sushi in my hometown of Maricopa and can't do it for under $40 or more for two.   All you can eat is available but I find that ordering individually is more economical.   Great atmosphere for a quick lunch or a large party for dinner.   The waitresses are Asian and I find that suitable for the restaurant. Some reviews on here complain about them. I don't have any issue with them they have always treated me nice and done their job well.   I will keep coming back.",

The $20 all you can eat deal is absolutely amazing the pieces were large and fresh and the chefs do a great job of spacing out your order (make a large order and it comes in manageable fresh waves rather then one big platter thats half warm by the time you get around to it). The head sushi chef (and owner) is personable and very funny and asked me and my girlfriend a bunch of questions and sliced us off additional pieces of whatever my girlfriend enjoyed without having to put in another order as she is more picky on her types of sushi then I am.

My wife's disease generally limits our options, but we can still have a delicious meal for very cheap: we recently got 16 pieces of salmon nigiri (8 orders), 1 Rainbow roll (probably too much cream cheese), and the Hamachi Jalapeno roll (damn good) for about 30 dollars total...that's a steal.  lastly, the service is always impeccable. They are great about separating gluten free items and bringing out gluten free soy sauce and getting our orders in promptly.   I can understand why some people don't like this place...but if you stick to what they do well you will have a fantastic time.",

    "text": "Location: it is located in a huge plaza with plenty of parking. The restaurant is relatively clean and organized. You can either seat on tables or the sushi bar.   Service: Their service is pretty good. We ordered all you can eat sushi. Waitress checked on our order at least 5 times to see if we wanted to order more or not. When you need some things - such as refill for tea or extra napkins, they will not avoid eye contact and get you what you need asap.   Food: for approx $23 per person, you can eat different variety of sushi. The meal includes edamame, miso soup and small salad followed by as many rolls as you can handled. We stuff our face until we couldn't eat anymore. The Unagi sushi was absolutely delicious and is the must ordered item. The tuna hand roll wasn't my favorite but I am glad that I've tried it. The rest of the rolls are fairly decent.   Rating: overall, I think the quality of sushi are pretty good for $23. I will definitely come back here again.",

We only order 3 rolls and a couple sashimi. I cancelled it. Honestly, sushi was decent, service was decent but their sushi chefs are TOO SLOW!!!! After I complained, they were nice enough not to charge me for one person but I left unsatisfied, hungry and regretting spending $72 at this place.

First i walk in with my son who is now 11 months old.   Stood there by the door for a while until someone i asked how many...I asked for a table for 3 and a baby. Which normally mean highchair. I was told to sit in a empty table by the wall.   I sat down. After alittle over 15 mins, no high chair, no water, no menu... I admit the place was busy and packed. But that is no excuse for not even looking at the customer and asking for a drink.  Another 10 mins or so passed, i finally got the highchair and got to order drink. Not hard, hot tea and water.  Hot tea came by another waitress but no water...  Even after my dates came, we waited another 20mins or so to order!  I got to the restaurant at 7 and got to order at 8:10ish! Not only that, we never got miso, salad or edamame which is included in the all you can eat.  I asked for the soup twice for my son, nope... No soup. The sushi arrive and we ate most of that since we waited so much!   Then she gave us the check no questions asked... Really? You wanna take our money after non existent service?   I will not be going to mido ever again.",

Service: Quick and kind Price: $21.99 per person for AYCE on the AYCE list Taste: Some of the fish had a nasty taste as if it were a bit old... such as the scallops. ALSO an important part to note is that... they have a HUGE rice portion on their sushi. Ive had sushi all over the places in California and Las Vegas.. however seen nothing similar to this place. The rice portion is so big.. if you eat like 3 pieces its similar to eating a FULL bowl of rice.. while other places i visited had rice portions a length of my pinky finger, so please be aware and order LITTLE BY LITTLE. Miso was also very bland, it just tasted like water with miso inside.",

    "text": "I've been going to Mido since 2009 maybe, and I'm just now remembering to do our long-term relationship justice with a proper review. Whenever I think to grab a hometown bite, Mido immediately comes to mind.  Mido has really been there for my formative foodie years, seeing me grow from an unversed teenage eater with an unhealthy exclusive inclination towards Las Vegas rolls into a sashimi fiend that can pick up a table with a pair of chopsticks. In all seriousness though, Mido was my first introduction into AYCE sushi and is one of the very few places that I can frequent without a smidgen of regret. I haven't had a single bad experience here over the past few years and Pancho always puts out nothing but the best in quality.   If you're doing AYCE, come hungry. Delving in can almost feel like a strategy-based system (\"How am I going to eat all of this? Will I need to go a pant size up after this meal? Do I have an extra hour to spare for the food coma that's sure to come?? Was I sent here by God to eat all of this food?\"), but just grab your faves early on and pace yourself. The Dragon, Orange, and Pancho rolls are pretty standard in my orders and never fail to impress. Pancho's even sent us a boat of just sashimi on occasion which, while indulgent, has really solidified my love for all things sushi.  I'm surprised to be reading up on a few mixed reviews on this place, since I'd be hard pressed to find another place in the valley that offers a dining experience with the same quality in food and service as Mido. Most definitely in my top 5 favorite places in Zona, if not anywhere.",

Their deep fried and special rolls are tasty and savoring. The nigiri rolls are good but I could tell that the ahi was previously frozen and not as fresh as I wanted it to me. Believe me, I'm from hawaii and I know what fresh fish looks and tastes like.  Most of the workers are Japanese. They are very welcoming and the chefs at the bar are really funny. However, we did have a server name Brian than was really passive aggressive to our group. Be careful if you have him as a server, he might add a smart/witty remark about your order.   Overall I rate them a 4 because of the environment and authenticity. It's really hard to find a japanese restaurant that has japanese people as owners.",

The baked scallop roll is warm and flavorful, the sashimi is usually fresh and the udon has bouncy noodles. The tempura is crisp and delicious as well. I've also had a wide range of their rolls and they all taste relatively good for sushi in Arizona. The all you can eat is a really good deal since you can get 3 rolls and make it up as it is only $19.99. If two people get it you can get a sashimi plate with a variety of fish.

The second time I went was my birthday and I ordered the all-you-can-eat sushi for $23.99! It was amazing! I ordered my favorite sashimi, nigiri and a couple rolls. I think I ended up ordering just over $30 worth of sushi alone so it was worth getting the all-you-can-eat. I was almost uncomfortably full. My boyfriend got the chicken yakisoba both visits and loved it. There was enough food on his plate for three meals and the price was very reasonable. The service is decent. They check on you just the right amount without ruining your date night. This is without a doubt my favorite sushi spot in the valley.

And we weren't offered ice cream at the end of the meal either.  Also, although it was advertised as $19.99, it's really $21.99.  Not a big deal, but I did scowl slightly at my receipt.  Unlike other days, they were very prompt about getting our second round of sushi, and this, I fully appreciate.  I guess in summary, don't expect anything other than what you order, but if on the off chance you do get a sashimi plate for an appetizer and ice cream for dessert, you're in for a treat.",

The happy hour menu for sushi is pretty extensive, and a lot of specialty rolls are included. The rolls themselves are a large portion of fish and vegetable. The quality is pretty good, especially for the price.  We ordered 6 different rolls and left very full. Even the basic rolls such as tuna and salmon have a lot of fish in them and are pretty large, compared to other sushi restaurants where your basic rolls have a tiny amount of fish, and are pretty anemic looking compared to others. We had 2 deep fried rolls with jalapeno, and they were perfectly crispy, with a nice spicy kick to them from the fresh pepper. We also tried a deep-fried chicken roll since it sounded like a pretty unusual roll. It was also delicious, with panko-crusted chicken wrapped in rice and seaweed.  The free salad, edamame, and miso soup is a nice beginning to your meal.   Service was cheerful and friendly. Drinks were refilled promptly as needed.  I'd love to come here to try their $20 all-you-can-eat deal. One of these days I'll head on over to pig out on their tasty sushi!",

Fish is very fresh any role topped with salmon is vibrant and you swear it was just swimming upstream in Alaska.  I wish some of the rolls like the spicy tuna would have a sliver of cucumber inside of it for some texture outside of that The entire meal was it a winner.

No.  But is it pretty good/decent?  Yes.  They have a decent happy hour if you aren't interested in eating more than $20 worth of sushi.  They also have a full menu if you or people in your group do not want sushi.    They do put carrots in a few sushi rolls, which I found to be odd, but I just ask them not to put carrots on anything and is cool.    If you go during a busy time or a large group, service can be slow.  But I usually go for an early dinner, so it works out for me.",

For $28 including tip you get wave after wave of a wide variety of sushi/nigiri/sashimi options they have as well as hot tea. If you choose this route I recommend the Mido roll and the Dragon rolls as they were ones that stood out from the generic other rolls we tried. Spicy jalapeno yellowtail was disappointing as the yellowtail was a mix of mayo, sriracha, and lackluster fish. The nigiri here was disappointing as well as the ones here are an example of quantity over quality. Do note that you won't be getting some of the better stuff they have when you order from the AYCE model.   A la carte I had a better experience as I chose the soba sushi dinner combo. The spicy tuna donburi and soba that I received for around $18 was massive as well as tasty with each entree coming out in one of those giant bowls they use for Pho or Bibimbap. My dining compatriots got the ramen and sushi/unagi and their bowls were just as big. (Though looking at the online menu I can't seem to find this amazing combo of food)  Sorta funny that some previous reviewers said this place is an all-japanese restaurant..... Place is full Korean owned lol (Which is why you'll see more fusion rolls and not some of the Japanese staples like the negiyama roll)  So yeah decent food that will fill you up and one of the few places in Phoenix that will do AYCE sushi.",

There is no limit to how much nigiri you get with the exception being one order of eel per person. Also you must eat the rice, not just the fish, and you also get either tempura or gyoza included. When you arrive you get a small salad, a miso soup and some edamane. Have been here 4 or 5 times now and have always gotten good service, quality sushi, and left full and happy. Here is what I got my most recent trip  Round1: Salmon, tuna, white toro, masago, eel, and a Vegas roll.   Round 2: Yellowtail, snapper, and albacore as well as a CA top Rainbow roll, and a haha roll.   The rolls were okay but honestly the star of the show is the nigiri. White toro is my favorite.

The miso soup was overly salty (this is sometimes due to keeping the soup over 48 hours-it happens to me at home)  and the salad dressing on the salad had a burnt taste to it.  All four persons at our table noticed this.  The tofu dome sushi roll was a tasty, filled with tofu, imitation crab and avocado.  It is a shame that the pork katsu was over done and dry for it was very good our last visit.  The gyoza was oily and lacked flavor.

The rolls are pretty standard fare, but they're consistently good.  The chefs are very friendly and do a nice job, however the wait service can be a little...confused at times.  We've had 3 different people serving us up front, but then we have to hunt someone down to put in another order or get our check.

    "text": "I really don't expect much from strip-mall sushi places in the east valley.  They are basically a dime-a-dozen and are generally just blah.  However, this place is the exception.  The first thing I noticed is that the inside is huge for a sushi place.  It is very nice and very well kept.  It doesn't look sticky and gross like some other places.  The entire staff is very friendly however our waitress disappeared 1/2 way through our meal which made getting my diet coke refills difficult.  They should really hire some more waitresses because the place gets pretty busy and with only 1 or 2 waitresses working the floor, they tend to get overworked.  Our party of 4 ordered a ton of sushi and I was amazed how fast it was put together.  I only saw 2-3 sushi chefs and the place was busy so they must be pretty awesome.  They have a great selection of sushi and everything we ordered looked to be very fresh and was delicious.  While we didn't order the always-popular all-you-can-eat sushi special; I do want to try it when I'm feeling gluttonous.  Their all-you-can-eat sushi menu seems pretty robust and has probably 30 different rolls on it.  I mean for $20 you really can't go wrong especially with the quality sushi this place seems to deliver.  I hope to return soon.",

The food is ok, nothing fancy here and you can feel some flavors here and there depending of the roll you're getting. They have happy hour during lunch and later too which is a nice option if you don't want to go with the All You Can Eat.  You'll get a miso soup and a tea ice cream as dessert which is a nice touch.  When it gets packed, it can be hard to get a good service however if you are at the sushi bar you'll get things quicker.  All in all it is a place to try at least once if you feel a bit nostalgic from the 70s.",

The place was pretty busy, so we were greeted at the door by a friendly woman, and seated at the Sushi Bar.  Hot towels were carefully tossed to us (as part of the \"show\").  The friendly Sushi Chef interacted with us right away, and took our first order for the $19.99 All-You-Can-Eat deal.  Salads and Miso Soup were brought and drink orders were taken by waitresses.  Sushi began appearing right away, and kept coming until we were sated. They do use large round pieces of carrot in their rolls, but I believe this is just their style, and not a 'cheat.' I didn't feel there was an inordinate amount of rice in the sushi.  It was all fresh, tasty, and plentiful, without delays reported by others. Service was friendly and efficient.  We'll be back!",

No.  But, is it fresh enough for me to crave it and drive 40 minutes (one way) just to go eat it.  Yes.    You can do an all you can eat \"man v. food\" style sushi deal for $20 (If two or more people at your table order this, you also get a sashami platter for free).  Or you can do a half off happy hour menu that is pretty good.  Plus you get miso soup, salad, edamame and hot towels.  If sushi isn't your thing, they have a great tempura selection and large portions for hot dishes.  Great for those who are sushi lovers, and those who just want to stuff themselves silly.  Time to see how much sushi you can really eat.",

    "text": "Been here a couple times now and have to say I really like this place. Not because the fish quality is amazing or the rolls are great but because it goes everything well. Nothing is really outstanding but the price and the rest is just solid For a $20 price you get miso soup, salad, edamame, choice or tempura or gyoza, ice cream and all you can eat sushi. That is a great deal and the sushi list is huge featuring a ton of specialty rolls and nigiri. I have never left this place not feeling like I got more than my moneys worth even on nights where I ate light.  As for the food like I said it is solid but not spectacular. The fish isn't bad but isn't out of this world either. It's just good. Unlike some other AYCE places I am not afraid to try things on the menu here and venture out and I am a bit of a fish snob and won't do that unless i feel comfortable with the level of quality at a place. I have found some things I am not a fan of her but nothing i felt was bad quality or stale. I am a big fan of a few of the specialty rolls who's name escapes me but I think it's the mido roll and the ahha roll. Also i like there spicy scallop which I don't like most places.  The services is also good here and the place is clean. You really aren't going to go wrong for the price and really worth the try. Only reason I withhold a 5th star is because the fish is just average and at a sushi place that is my key grade. Of the AYCE places around though this one is a solid pick.",

I had read that as you come inside, they throw you a hot towel for your face (kids were looking forward to this too!) but the only thing that hit me was the cold slap of reality - it just wasn't very good.  My second star was for service - they were friendly.  But the meal was not that great - the sushi was very plain, and little too close to room temperature for my taste.

ALL DAY......... so I did the math and it was cheap to just get the happy hour price then to pay 20 each person. Now on the weekends that deal makes more sense. Now if u don't eat what u order they will charge u what u didn't eat. That is if u left a whole roll.. I personally would not go again.",
