The black pepper chicken is amazing and it took approx. 20 min for my food to arrive. Simple healthy fresh food. The portions are huge if you order the dinner plate for $7 or you can go for the bowl with is $5 ( still plenty of food). Customer service is also on point.",

The salt and pepper squid is great... try the Hong Kong style chow mein with pan fried noodles, it's very well done.  These guys are masters with eggplant.  I see people buy things at Mekong (meats, seafood) and bring them in with them and the place here will cook it up.  Very cool.  You can't beat the prices, either.  I usually go here with a friend or two, and 30 bucks gets us enough food to all take home leftovers and have a second meal.  It's a place that would rival some of my favorite Chinese dives in LA and San Francisco (and that is a big compliment in my mind).  Great place and I'm glad to see that so many others appreciate it too.",

Excellent food with a huge menu to choose from, awesome soups and noodle dishes and ridiculously inexpensive!! I knew the place was authentic when I walked in and saw items on the wall written in English and Chinese. The ulitmate confirmation came from a friend of mine who lived in China for many years and he told it me it was just like the food he ate while there. I have been going here for 5 years and have been exploring my way through the menu and have yet to be dissapointed.   The ambiance is very simple ad it can get loud, but the food, the staff  the drive (for those not in the East Valley) are SOOOOO worth it!!  GO!!!",

After the training I asked her if she had found any good Hong Kong style restaurants and she recommended this place. I'm glad I asked.   We were greeted at the door and water arrived right away. Super friendly. Excellent, HUGE menu. Here the American and Chinese menus are combined, so there is no need to ask for the \"secret menu.\"   We ordered two Hong Kong style chow meins, one chicken and one seafood; egg rolls for our son; spicy dumplings, spicy sauce chicken hot pot; and Kung Pao beef for my stepson. Everything was just great.   This is a little family run strip mall place. Nothing fancy. Nothing pretentious. Just my kind of place--good food, good service, and good prices. Highly recommended.",

It was busy but we got menus within 30 seconds and our food arrived less than 5 minutes after we ordered it.  We had the spicy chicken wings (really salt and pepper chicken wings) which were fantastic and the the spicy dumplings to start.  Excellent.  For mains, we had a spicy shrimp dish and the eggplant spareribs, both delicious.  Our waiter checked back in with us four or five times to  refill our water, ask us if we wanted anything else, etc.  The staff is very friendly here.  As others have pointed out here, it's a Hong Kong style diner, meaning a kind of cheap, no-frills, \"let's grab some food on the way home\" kind of place with Cantonese comfort food (joke, chow fun, rice bowls) and Chinese interpretations of western dishes.  If this place were near my office, I'd have lunch here everyday.  Alas, it is not.    It's also just crazy cheap.  Appetizers run $2.21 and the entrees all top out at $7.72 with a generous selection of one-dish meals at a flat five bucks.  Hard to beat that.",

They did not put ay sauce or give me a side of sauce for my sweet and sour chicken, and the orange chicken was mushy and plain.

I enter Chinese restaurants with the understanding that I will be indulging happily in high calorie meal but when your dish displays a separated layer of oil, it makes you lose your enthusiasm. For the third dish, the steamed chicken was tasty, accompanied with the wonderfully pungent garlic/ginger side.  I hope to write a better review next time...............I'll pack some Rolaid's.  ;)",

My favorite is towards the back of the menu for the hong kong style dishes. All dishes are reasonably priced with wings and appetizers from $2.50-4.50 and main plates from $4-8.00. Portions are huge. When my fiance and I are feeling lazy and not trying to spend too much money, we drive 5 minutes and come to Asian Cafe Express. The best deal (imo) is the family set dinner for $25.50. That includes a vegetable plate or soup, white rice ( $2 extra for fried) and then 3 entrees of your choice. For $25 it feeds us dinner, and then lunch for another few days. Easily enough for 5-6 people in my opinion.",

There's no shortage of vegetarian dishes, and  any of the meat cuisine can pretty much be replaced with Tofu.  Everything, I order here, was delectable and utterly packed with bits, there was no scrimping on the meat substitute.  If you are a pescetarian, there is a lot of fishy edibles in the menu at reasonable prices too!  My carnivorous friends have also assured me that the meat menu is equally amazing.

My main dish was around $4, FOUR DOLLARS (and some change). The portion was also great, I had leftovers. The orange chicken had a savory crisp layer and reminded me of another great Chinese Food restaurant located in the Chinese Cultural Center off 44th Street in Phoenix. I definitely recommend.",

This week it's a crispy chicken dish with country style sauce. It turned out to be one of the best chicken dishes I've ever had - really juicy and tender, with crispy skin and covered with a savory spicy sauce. This was one of two dishes we ordered and came a bit later than the other one probably because of extra time needed to crisp up the skin in frying, but it was worth the slight additional wait. This place never ceases to amaze and delight me.",

Well, this place didn't fall behind in any aspect.  The Chili chicken dimpling is very good. The fried dimpling was average. The fried Shrimp was crispy and flavorful. The Chili salt chicken wings were excellent! The black pepper chicken over Brown rice was very good as well. Overall, very good food and service!   Great job being the first Hong Kong style cafe in AZ! I would definitely come back if I'm in the area.",

You can swap the vegetable dish out for a soup. I love their eggplant and spare ribs dish - eggplant is always soft and fill of flavor. Another good dish is the crispy noodle dish. The restaurant is a little dirty and I'm too scared to check out the bathroom, that's the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. There's also free parking outside, which is a plus!",

After cooking almost the same things for myself for a good three months I decided I needed a change of flavors. The service was fast and attentive as I was seated immediately on a Sunday during lunch hour. I ordered the Chinese Beef Stew Noodle Soup. The herbal taste of the soup was overwhelming in the beginning, but my taste buds must have gotten used to it after a few sips... so I guess it was okay? The meat and noodle was good. Overall, the noodle soup was decent and until I find a better spot this will place will suffice if I am having any Chinese food cravings.",

The staff is friendly and eager to assist in your dining experience. The place has round tables, and wooden booths. There's pictures of their dishes through out the walls, along with a small TV up in the corner. The menu is vast, so do take your time pursuing it. We got the family style meal with 3 main entrees that included rice and vegetable lo mein for $35.00, They do not have fountain drinks, so be prepared to pay for an extra refill on soda. There is take away, but I firmly believe you get more food dining there then in the carry out. It is between light rail stops and near Mekong Plaza.",

The quantity they give you is very generous, def made to share. and their prices are the cheapest in town, without cutting into quality.  I have tried many of their dishes and have enjoy most of them.  If you're new to chinese food, just look at their pics on yelp and order from there. thats the easiest way.  My only complaint is the food is a lil greasy.  Especially their stir friend stuff, its not an alarming amount, but it isnt the most healthiest amount.  But over all this place is great, and the service is fast too.  all my togo orders take less than 10 mins to get  Pro: -cheap prices -generous portions -authentic  -taste greeeeeeeeeeat -fast service  Cons -greasy food -ran down looking store.",

Patience is rewarded though! Usually the quality of the food has always been top notch; but like all good restaurants, you need to know what you like or you might end up with a meal unsuited for you. The fried rice is the bomb, and comes in too many varieties for me to list here; including those that you would not find on an Americanized Chinese Food Menu. The only thing that I would say is a draw back is the new egg rolls, the egg rolls were at one time a must have but the new supply is forgettable at best. If you like Chinese food then you must try this place, but I would say to do so before 5pm otherwise you will get caught up in the crowd.",

    "text": "This restaurant is so underrated! My favorite lunch and dinner spot gives me delicious and inexpensive Chinese food. One time, I brought my Jewish friend over to this restaurant. It was an unforgettable experience for her and every time she visits, she would ask when I will bring her back although I could just always give her the address and she can just drive back but I don't know why. She lives in Tempe.  I like the rice bowls the best, very affordable. A $4.50 orange chicken rice bowl fills me all day. Sometimes when I'm not too hungry, I will have some leftover and be excited to heat it up after I get off work.  Enough with the American oriented Chinese food like Panda Express but heck cheaper, you can also order authentic Chinese (Cantonese) food here. I ordered some delicious roasted pork and fried fish before as well.  Did I not mention their fried rice? The fried rice isn't too wet or too dried. I hate sticky and wet fried rice. This restaurant has none. I love the combo one because it has seafood, beef, pork, and chicken all together. I can't decide and don't have to so I pick all of them in one dish - the best of worlds. Their lo mein is hallelujah. One plate is huge and cheap. When I eat, I pay a lot of attention to the flavor, price, and size. This lo mein has everything I ask for. There is nothing I can take a star or two off for because the customer service is food. They serve food quickly. The area is clean enough. This is not a fancy restaurant so I don't expect a high class service.",

The wings were sopped in garlic and butter. The teriyaki beef and Hawaiian Beef tastes like they had the exact same sauce. The eggrolls were fried too long and full of cabbage with little meat.

We've been here a few times now and we almost always get the same wonderful waitress and she always remembers our order. Our waiers are always refilled and we never need to wave anyone down to try and get another refill, unlike other places we've been to.  The food is also delicious! It's so authentic and full of flavor, and you don't have to wait too long for your order. Also, the pricing is very reasonable especially for the portion sizes they give. My boyfriend and I always pay around $15 for both our meals together, and we leave with very full bellies.  We would recommend this place to anyone looking for an authentic Asian restaurant in Arizona. The place is low key and not high end, but if you're really looking for authenticity and great flavor this is the place to go to. I always get the kung pao shrimp and my boyfriend gets the Mongolian beef and we both love it.  Thank you Asian Cafe Express for being awesome!",

Most of the time you walk in and nobody says a word to you so I've learned to just seat myself. When the waitress finally gets over to your table they are very nice. However, the time it takes for you just to get your food and drinks is a bit too long. It seems to me that it is an understaffing issue. There is usually only 1-2 servers when the place is packed.   Just a heads up the regular portion size is plenty for me to be full and have lunch leftovers for the next day.",

    "text": "Pros: Fast service, extensive menu, very inexpensive, large portions. The food came out so steaming hot that my eyeglasses fogged up. Menus are in English and Chinese and Chinese speakers were picking up \"to-go\" orders so this looked like a good sign. Cons: I ordered orange chicken with brown rice. The sauce tasted odd, the rice was fine, but the chicken was dried out (to the point that much of it was impossible to eat) and the sauce and the breading on the chicken had an odd metallic taste. I could not finish the food as I was feeling queasy about half way through. I continued to have this unpleasant taste in my mouth for about another hour (even with drinking copious amounts of water to rinse out my mouth). I really wanted to like this place based on other Yelp reviews and the fact that it is locally owned and not a chain, but I really cannot recommend the food here.",

    "text": "Why oh why is Asian Express not closer to me? I would eat here so much more.. with it's incredibly affordable, vast options, and authentic deliciousness. I had the combo chow fun, and it's very rare that anybody gets it right (as far as I have tried previously anyways), and it was spot on. Sauce proportion was perfect ratio with amount of noodles and meat. Noodles had the right amount of stickiness and not stuck in annoying chunks.  The second time I came here, I ordered the combo fried rice with hot and sour soup. I wasn't really feeling the soup since it tasted overly sour and Americanized, but the fried rice was perfect, I love the amount of oil used so that each grain is separated and not bunched up and mushy like a lot of other places.   It was quite embarrassing how I (gulp) left my wallet in the car like an idiot though. I apologized profusely and said I would leave all my personal belongings (including my purse and iPhone) with them if they would allow me to quickly grab my wallet, that was sitting in my car 10 feet away from the store front. They had no problems with it, and even insisted that I don't need to leave my belongings with them.. how trusting of them. As I came back and paid for my food, they told me not to worry about it.   Not only does this place deserve 5 stars for their food, but 5 stars for just being great people.",

    "text": "I've been to China three times now and spent fourteen weeks there in total, so I definitely know what Chinese food should taste like. Asian Cafe Express is the most authentic Chinese food I have found in America. The restaurant itself reminds me of how many restaurants are in China, from the pictures of the dishes on the wall, to the spicy sauce sitting on the table. The dishes seem to mostly represent the styles of Southern China and Hong Kong, which makes sense because most of the staff comes from those regions.   Even better than the authenticity of the food are the prices. A specialty bowl consisting of a menu item and rice only costs $3.98. That's fantastic considering how satisfying the meal is.   If you want to taste authentic Chinese food without having to pay for expensive plane tickets, check out Asian Cafe Express. And if you can take the heat, order the Kung Pao Chicken!",

    "text": "So I'm not sure why, but it's been exceedingly difficult for me to find a good Chinese restaurant in AZ.  I guess I'm really spoiled with NY spots.  I used to have a place that knew exactly how to fry the tofu and substituted tofu for any dish that was made with meat.  The portions were large and came out to $5.75.  I find AZ Chinese Restaurants either don't cater to vegetarians at all, are too \"shi-shi\" or don't have good lunch specials.   And they never put broccoli in the dishes, what's up with that????  Now, out of all the places I've gone to this one came the closest to giving me the flavor I needed.  If you're a vegetarian, they can modify many dishes to suit your needs.  The hostess was very helpful!  Because of this, I am encouraged to go back and try more things.  No lunch specials for veggies tho.  I ordered a large size of Kung Pao Tofu with brown rice.  Yay for brown rice!  This is the FIRST place out here I've found that has it!!  The Kung Pao was a bit spicy for me, but that's how it's supposed to be.  I ordered it because it was the closest thing I could get to General Tso.  Their portions are large and the service was great.",

    "text": "Asian Cafe Express shares the same Chinese name as the Cafe de Coral in Hong Kong, and boasts itself as \"Arizona's 1st Hong Kong style cafe serving authentic Chinese, Southeast Asia & Western influenced dishes\". Over 300 dishes are found on the menu, ranging from the classic Hong Kong style baked pork chop rice to the Americanized sweet and sour pork. Even Hawaiian roast pork appears on the menu. Despite offering a wide selection of Chinese dishes, Asian Cafe Express lacks the \"outstanding factor\" since it is a \"jack of all trades, master of none\" restaurant. This type of restaurant serves nearly everything in an ordinary fashion and neglects to specialize in any particular dish.  I came to Asian Cafe Express for a weekday lunch and the restaurant was packed. Most of the guests were eating ACE's $3.98 special bowl, a one-item Americanized rice bowl (kung pao chicken, teriyaki chicken, sweet and sour pork, etc.). I summoned the Cantonese waiter and ordered a baked pork chop rice. He told me I would have to wait 45 minutes to 1 hour for this dish. LOL, who has that long to eat lunch? In nearly all HK cafes that I have been to, only 10 to 15 minutes is required to deliver this dish to my table even when the kitchen is busy. All the ingredients are generally pre-processed such that the rice just needs to be stir-fried and the ingredients just needs to be baked to melt the cheese before the baked pork chop rice is served. Unfortunately, this preparation is absent at ACE, likely due to its low demand. A 60 minute estimate suggests that the pork chops had not been cut and fried, the vegetables have not been diced, and/or the rice has not been stir-fried or cooked. Basically the dish is cooked from scratch.   Alternatively, I ordered the Fresh Tomatoes with Two Eggs and Beef since it was guaranteed to be out instantly. It arrived in 20 minutes. This rice plate is considered as a basic and classic HK over-rice dish. It was acceptable, the egg was fried crispy on the corners yet not burnt, an attribute that even some HK cafes in Southern California neglect. The tomatoes gravy was not as salty as I expected and beef were tender and cooked properly. However, my biggest concern was the rice that was used. The rice texture was poor. It resembled a very loose rice pilaf rather than Jasmine rice. Rice pilaf is highly uncharacteristic of what is served at a traditional Hong Kong style cafe.  To complement the rice dish, I also ordered the daily soup - a carrot and Chinese vegetable soup. It was probably the best Cantonese old-fire soup available in Arizona. Unfortunately, the soup was very oily and contained a lot of MSG. It definitely does not pass the home-style quality test.  Finally, I ordered the HK style coffee with milk tea (yin-yeung), to complete the HK-cafe experience. The young waiter informed me that it would take over 30 minutes to prepare, because he had to boil the water and then steep the tea. I received the drink in a soup cup (LOL). I could tell that milk tea and hot beverages are not ordered often enough for the restaurant to order mugs. The yin yeung was prepared with the HK-style procedure, mixing coffee and milk tea in equal proportions, but the milk tea was prepared in an odd way (red tea was mixed with a dash of 2% milk). Overall, the taste was acceptable for Arizona standards. At least better than some places in LA, which give you 75% coffee, 25% English tea, and condensed milk.   Asian Cafe Express offers authentic Cantonese dishes on their menu but I think some of the proper ingredients are lacking in Arizona, so the dishes cannot be prepared with the same standard as those found in Hong Kong or even Los Angeles. In Arizona, ACE is considered one of the best HK-style restaurants, but in LA, the restaurant would not survive for more than 6 months.",

    "text": "Best Chinese food in the city... and thee WORST service in the state!  That's the best way to sum up this place. There isn't much that isn't said already in the vast amount of reviews for this place... Now I HATE bad service. I've been known to walk out or ask to see a manager if I get shitty service, but this place has such amazing food, it kind of works itself out.   The first time I came here, it took over half an hour for the waitress to ask us what we wanted to drink (!) and then it took another 45 minutes for them to bring the food to us after we ordered. And what I hate is that the servers all have this American Diner from the 60s attitude like \"yeah, yeah, yeah... I'm coming, I'm coming. Whaddaya have?\" Geez, some fucking service with a smile please? In dining here a few times, this doesn't let up... even when the room is HALF FULL it will STILL take forever to be waited on and it will STILL take forever to get your food, I suggest bringing in some tacos from JITB as an appetizer. Also, protip: if you act like you're in a rush or suuuuper annoyed you'll get faster service; something I picked up on when some regulars at the next table over told me and my friend they do it all the time.   Do NOT go here if you're in a rush, it's going to take at least an hour to dine here aaaaand about 15 minutes to eat all the delicious food!! My favorite meal is the Egg Drop Soup to start w/ Orange chicken & Hawaiian beef for the meal with egg friend rice HOLD the onions. perfect meal, less than $30 with enough left overs for a healthy midnight snack... okay 10:30PM snack!",

So, I like to order a lot of things when I first visit a place.  Monday, I ordered Szechuan Spicy Water Boil Fish, Chili Salt Chicken Wings, Peking Pork Rib, Salt & pepper squid and combo chowfun.   It was so good that I went back on Wednesday and tried the orange chicken bowl and combo fried rice.   Most asians NEVER order orange chicken when they go eat chinese food. But I dare to try after seeing the picture.  BEST DECISION OF MY LIFE!!!!!!! Their orange chicken is AMAZING! better than Panda. Also, its only like $4!   Price, portion, and quality of food is Amazing!",

    "text": "Short story: Looking for a cheap lunch that's just OK? Come eat here.   Long story: Ambiance: typical hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant reminiscent of the type Chinese restaurant that you would find all over New York City.  Service: excellent!! The servers and waitresses were always walking ensuring that my drink was full, and making sure that all my dining needs were met.  Food: I ordered pork eggrolls, hot and spicy bowl of soup, and the house special lo mein. All of the foods came out piping hot, and looked beautiful. However, all the dishes lacked the flavor and spice i usually associate with Chinese and szcehchuan  style cooking. The eggrolls, although crispy, lacked the pork flavor that I was looking for. The soup was hot and had plenty of high-quality ingredients, but it was not particularly sour and hot testing. The lo mein had plenty of chicken, beef, and shrimp. It also had that smoky panseared flavor that is characteristic of a good tasting lo mein, however, it was still somewhat bland.  Cost: two pork eggrolls, huge bowl of hot and sour soup, and whole plate of house special lo mein came to a total of $11.50!  Verdict: Asian cafe express is a great place to go if you want a quick cheap lunch; however it is not particularly the most flavorful Chinese food I've had. I'll come back and try something else before I cast my final judgment or recommendation.",

We got the hot and sour soup, preserved egg and shredded pork congee, satay beef, and minced pork and eggplant with garlic sauce. What we did not realize was how big the portions were! We were only able to eat less than half of all of the dishes.  I found the minced pork and eggplant with garlic sauce a little greasy, and I wish it had a little more pork. The congee could have done with more preserved egg, and the satay beef could have been spicier. That being said, those are just personal preferences.  I was incredibly happy with the service as well, and I am definitely coming back again in the future!",

A little more oily and just not right.  It is our favorite meal there so we shrugged it off.  Tonight we went again for the black bean chicken and seafood over rice.  While service was fast, the meals came separately.  The seafood came first and looked yummy.  The fish cake however, tasted sour and we removed it from the dish.  The black bean dish was extra salty and somewhat oily.  We were very disappointed with both meals despite the fact they give you a huge plate of food.  Sorry ACE, we will have to search elsewhere for good Chinese food.",

Love the variety of foods they have here and many things I don't know, so I will have to learn.  I got to practice some Cantonese, which was great.  I'm used to ordering from places like Saigon, Tao Gardens, Mekong for Cantonese food, and some of the dishes are a little different than what I know.  However, I'm game to learn.  It's been more than a year since I really dislike going to Tao Gardens and their food has changed to not be good.  So, maybe Asian Cafe will be its replacement.  Only drawback for me is that it's a little far.  My husband isn't convinced yet, so maybe we'll have to have an extended family dinner here where we can order a lot of different dishes and he can try many dishes.  It was just him and I when I ordered, which I couldn't order that many dishes for 2 people for take out.",

What's  really great are their  portion sizes where you get the most bang for your buck.   This is not a fancy pants restaurant  but a family owned restaurant. When they get busy it's  sometimes hard to flag the sister team  down but the food  is always  good.   We like to order their:  Crispy Salt Pepper Tofu- this always comes steaming hot and they are so addicting!  Orange Chicken- I usually stay  away from this type of food but their's is actually good. Other similar sweet & sour items on menu ( Hong Kong Sweet Sour Spareribs, Peking Spareribs)  Combo Chow Fun or Beef Chow Fun- The combo chow fun  has  bok choy, squid & shrimp we order it with the  light gravy. Wish they put more soy sauce. Beef chow fun is good and has wok hei! That nice noodle char.   Drinks: Hong Kong Milk Tea & Taro coconut drink. Hong  Kong Milk Tea is always good  has strong flavor red black tea and condensed milk. Taro coconut is my fave here with real taro bits and tapioca!  You'll  see lots of people ordering take out or coming in groups because their family-style portions are great! We love to take visitors here to show warm hospitality. We are definitely regulars!",

From the sound of the name,  you wouldn't think much of Asian Cafe Express.  However, they do a very nice job of putting out some authentic Cantonese food.  The taste and flavors of their dishes are not exactly what we have come to like, but everyplace has there variances according to the cook.  Still, both times we have come with 6 or 7 seven people and have ordered enough food for double that.  Both times, the food was very consistent and I have no complaints about anything.  The girls there work hard and are pretty quick considering only 2 of them handle the whole restaurant.  Prices here are very reasonable, even for Chinese food.",

I was with a large group of people, and half the table ordered the family set.   I ordered the Fujian style noodles that came in a broth--it was delicious! I wolfed it down, as I did the red bean drink. I had never had a red bean drink before--I loved it so much I had to order another one to take home.  Also for take out, I ordered the Amoy noodles, Yang Chow Fried Rice and orange chicken. The fried rice and orange chicken was really good, but the Amoy noodles were lacking the tang I'm used to. I probably won't order the Amoy noodles again, but there are a TON more dishes from the menu that I'll be going back to try at Asian Cafe Express!  The service was also very prompt and nice. The food came out quickly, and the prices were more than reasonable! The portions are also generous. They closed at 9pm, but with our large group we were chatting away til 9:30pm. We didn't realize they were closed! They never rushed us and were very nice! We were taken aback when we walked out and saw the hours of operation, and definitely appreciated how kind they were.",

The food has good flavor and there are a lot of Canton people there all the time, so you know it's really authentic. Rice plates are the best value for your money.

We ordered the northern set dinner and a plate of boiled dumplings.   The dumplings were good but the skin was broken and falling apart, so they were boiled for too long. The flavor was there but it was overcooked. The northern set had egg soup, chicken, pork, shrimp, eggplant and garlic veges. Overall, everything was tasty and came out hot and fresh. The soup was good but a little generic, the spicy chicken was very good and so was the garlic veges. I love the eggplant and that is one of the reasons I wanted to order the Northern set but the pork that it came with was a little weird. The pork with the eggplant tasted either dry or overcooked and it was very tough. Both the chicken and shrimp dishes were good as well. Overall, everything was good and the food came out pretty fast. And the Asian Cafe Express was pretty authentic as well.   Overall, its a pretty good Chinese restaurant with decent prices. The menu was pretty long, so I highly recommend choosing a set meal because it does get a little overwhelming.",

It's totally chaotic most of the time, the place could be cleaner, the portions are large, aesthetics are not a priority, the menu is extensive, it's cheap, and the food is consistently good to very good.  This is solid 4 star food with prices from yesteryear.  The fried squid is about $9 for a large plate, and is perfectly fried and seasoned.  The seafood chow fun is delicious.  It comes with a light sauce, the noodles are well executed,  the seafood is fresh and plentiful and it's a huge bargain at under $10.  Sometimes it could use a little more salt, but that isn't a problem to me.  The Chinese style soup noodles with Shanghi bok choi, shrimp and pork wontons, and egg noodles in a pork broth are delicious and another bargain at under $8.    The prices here are so reasonable I hardly look at them, amazing for yours truly, as I am a foodie bargain hunter.  Some might find the food here a little bland, but remember this is basically Cantonese food, one of the least spiced of China's eight schools of cooking.  ACE will always turn the heat up if you ask.   Overall, this is a solid Chinese restaurant with many Asian patrons, a good sign. The food is consistent and the prices are easy on the wallet.

I am happy I discovered this restaurant actually _before_ they received (many) coveted New Times Best of Phoenix awards. They serve probably 1,000 different dishes, some cooked to order, and include Hong Kong Style. I would eat here everyday if I had the chance, and it seems many people agree. It is always a joy to eat here.",

    "text": "After shopping at Mekong the family decided they were hungry.  I thought we were going home, but NOPE!  So checking to see what was nearby I spotted this place with 4 stars.  And it was just across the street!  So we put the groceries in the trunk and walked over.  From the outside it looks pretty ordinary.  A neon sign tells you that you are there.  It was very crowded when we walked in, but a booth was open so we grabbed it.  Within 10 minutes there were even more people and some had to wait for tables to open up.  I figured this was a good sign.  First impression:  slow service. Dive.  Shabby interior and it took a while to get the menus.  Extensive menu. Lots to choose from.  Which is cool.  It took a while to go through everything.  Even then it took a while for them to take our order.  They probably need a third server, at least during dinner.  The wait was unreasonably long.  Once ordered it took a reasonable time for the food to show up.  At least assuming they are cooking it fresh (which I'm assuming).  The food:  big portions, simple but good flavors  I can't really rave about it.  It was good.  We were all happy with our choices.  Mine was supposed to be spicy (it had the red pepper symbol on the menu), but it really wasn't.  It was still good, though.  Was this \"as good as it gets\"?  No.  I could probably go to 4 stars if we hadn't had to wait 20-30 minutes to take our order.  It only took 10 minutes to go over the menu, and they didn't check on us at all until at least 20 minutes.  Food was tasty, and portions were large, but the wait was excessive.",

Black pepper chicken: has a very flavorful sauce and is delicious over rice.  Fried rice: generic, I know, but still one of my all-time favorites.  House noodles: also very flavorful.  these pan fried noodles have a great sauce and come with meat and veggies!  Overall, not the classiest restaurant, but it is extremely worth it for the price, especially on a college student budget!  It's also accessible from the light rail, and right across from the asian market, which makes the location rather convenient.",

They carry Hong Kong traditional menu items such as Chinese Broccoli, Thousand Year Egg Soup, Hong Kong styled fried rices and noodles, and a bunch of other things as well!

It's a pretty basic looking chinese resto off of Phoenix Asian strip (I meant along Dobson, for some reason most Asian resto/market concentrated along this street..don't ya think?). Food quantity is good but quality? I think they can do a bit better, hence the four stars. Service is so so depending how tired the servers are (don't blame them, looks like they're there erreday from open to close) but they always box your leftovers for ya so can't complain! Overall, I definitely recommend this place. Try their wings, black pepper chicken, fish & bokchoy, combo xo fried rice, crispy ribs chow mein with black bean sauce and the coffee milk tea with boba! :)",

    "text": "Mmm ACE, you are aces! You know a restaurant is good when you crave them MONTHS after visiting them. I had the chance to spend a wonderful day with my Foodie Bear and a friend. I don't normally venture into Mesa, but he convinced me to go to dinner with them at ACE. I'm SO glad I decided to go!  When you first walk in, you'll notice the place isn't much to look at. As most of you foodies know, never judge a book by its' cover! We were warmly greeted and we sat down to review the HUGE menu. They offer your run of the mill Pan Asian cuisine but then they offer various authentic dishes that will make you melt!  Since I had never been there before, and I will eat pretty much anything that doesn't eat me first, I allowed Foodie Bear to order the food! When the waitress came to the table he immediately ordered the baked pork chop. I don't know if she even got out her greeting. The Bear knows what the Bear wants! Apparently this dish takes a while to cook. We also picked the Peking pork ribs, I believe some orange chicken, and an order of fried rice. As an appetizer, I tried a spring roll.  I could see the boyish glee on FB's face while we waited a short time for our food to arrive so I knew I was in for a treat! The food started to arrive and we dug in. Oh my goodness the flavors! The baked pork chop was amazing. It really reminded me more of a simple Italian dish than an Asian one. The parallels between the two countries' cuisines were really highlighted in this dish. A nice tomato based sauce, tender pork chop over a bed of white rice. It was very well made! My favorite were the Peking short ribs. They had a semisweet glaze over a lightly battered, tendered piece of meat. Careful of the bones! Their fried rice was nice and smoky flavored, a sign of a seasoned wok. I didn't try the orange chicken as I was full to the top, but it smelled great!  I frequently think of my visit to ACE. I can't wait to return to try another one of their many dishes. I can't wait to find another craving!",

If it's your first time going there you might think to yourself, hmmm, so I order off the wall menu? They do have an expansive menu that not only has chinese food but also food from Singapore, Japan and Thai variations. I'm pretty much a simple guy to please, so chicken with vegetables is my choice. The chicken comes out tender and they use breast instead of thigh meat that a lot of other chinese places use. The vegetables still has that crunch to them and not the overdone limpness that you get at some places. The service is always excellent and quick. If you can get past the looks of the interior and just base it on the food, ACE is the Place. (I couldn't resist)",

We were expecting it to be in peanut sauce but was far from it. We wont be getting that again but we also paired it with Chicken Fried Rice which was a whopping 5 dollars. I'm not going to lie, this Fried Rice was the best I've ever had. I definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for authentic Chinese/ Hong Kong style cuisine!!!

My wife and I live in Prescott Valley, and there isn't a Chinese restaurant there that deserves to be called Chinese.  Waaayyyy different story here.  They have an AZ Menu for those used to \"Americanized\" Chinese food and the Hong Kong menu for the REAL DEAL.  When we arrived at 2:15 p.m. the place was jammed and thankfully, most of the patrons were Chinese!!  That's the first \"tell\" that you have a good place.  Secondly, the Hong Kong Menu had 4 times the number of pages than the AZ Menu - -also a good sign.  My wife and I ordered 5 dishes, which amazed the waitress.  After we explained about where we lived and that there will be a takeout order as well as the leftovers, she was very happy and understood.  We had the crispy tofu, steamed chicken with vegetables, beef stew hot pot, combo chow mien and beef with XO sauce.  Everything was fantastic.  The sauce that came with the crispy tofu was a house specialty and really added a lot to a normally bland dish.  We used the same sauce on the steamed chicken, which was quite tasty by itself.  Beef with XO sauce was initially spicy, but tamed down the more of it you ate.  The  beef stew hotpot - one of the best I had anywhere and  the combo chow mein was above par.  We did have a large amount left over, which was packed to go with our added order for beef stew noodle soup, wonton noodle soup and Yangchou fried rice.  Haven't yet tried those, as it was only yesterday that we went.  However, I have no doubt that they will be even more delectable, as soup only gets better with time.  We will definitely be back.",

The great thing about this place is you can try so many things because it is cheap cheap cheap! Only $3.98 for a huge bowl, think two meals, of meat and rice. I liked the chicken egg rolls. I could hardly distinguish between the orange chicken and spicy chicken sauces, but the chicken itself was good. White rice cooked properly, also good.  The thing I was most looking forward to was my veggie lo mein. Sadly it was literally drowning in soy. Other than that, well prepared. I ate it cold the next day and it wasn't bad. I would get it again and ask them to go light on the sauce. The staff is super friendly and sweet. The atmosphere is nonexistent. Probably will choose takeout next time.

Asian Cafe Express, despite its very Amercanized name, is as close to authentic as I can ask for in Phoenix. Just to check, I ordered something that only an HKer would love and know (and order): beef innards with ho fan. I'm not even sure if it's offered on the menu under one of their HK-style noodle dishes, because once I found out the staff spoke Chinese, I ordered it in Chinese. The tripe/intestines were braised in the authentic way and definitely tasted authentic; the broth came with both chives and scallions, which is also pretty authentic. I do find their selection of noodles limited as I wanted silver-needle noodles, but I understand that might be too much to ask of a place that's not even in a proper Chinatown setting. For $5.10, I got a giant bowl of noodles that I couldn't even finish. I'll definitely go back and try a few other dishes to test this place's authenticity but for now, it gets my thumbs up!",

It's hard to please all of us at one place. The food here though, everyone loved!   We did the family style dinner which had more than enough food and super cheap! We got the orange chicken, sweet n sour chicken, Mongolian beef, Hong Kong shrimp as part of the family dinner. It also came with lo Mein, fried rice and white rice. That was all part of the dinner and was delicious! We loved their dumpling appetizer and it came with 10 of them!! All of their sauces were absolutely amazing.   I had been saving my salt intake for this, so if your sodium intake was high (and if you have to watch it like I do) don't eat here until you're low.   Sadly it's far away from where we live.

The eggplant and spareribs are really amazing.   The eggplant absorbs the garlic sauce really nice!   The veggie chow fun had a delicate flavor and the veggies were cooked just right.

I came here for the first time yesterday after remembering a co-worker recommended it once and decided to give them a try. I was really craving some crab rangoon and around the Valley, I just can't seem to find decently made rangoons that are priced for what they are worth.   Their crab rangoons (or crab puffs) are 2 for 2.25, which I felt was pretty steep, and even more so when I got them and they aren't bigger than a quarter, and when I got home, realized they weren't even filled. I got three orders which equals 6 crab rangoon and I basically paid for fried wontons! I also asked for fried rice and received white rice instead.   The food is good, I'll give them that though I'm not sure if I'm willing to come back and pay for fried wontons. I will shop around elsewhere.",

For appetizers I had the veggie rolls and fried onions rings which were delightfully perfect. For my main meal I enjoyed the curry chicken fried rice which requires no need for a description of its deliciousness. I shall return to this cozy laid back place.",

If you do go, please do not order those fake Chinese food like orange chicken. Kindly ask the waitresses and they would gladly give you some suggestions. You can also look at the wall for the food with pictures if you don't know what you are order.   Service: The waitresses were very nice. They were short-handed when we got in but the service was great nonetheless. They were checking up on us every 5-10 min.   Overall: This place is my go-to spot for some really good Chinese food. This is located in Mesa and I live in Avondale. This should describe how good the food is at this place. If you give this a try, you won't regard the quality of the food from this place.",

    "text": "Asian Cafe Express, or ACE, hasn't changed much over the last few years. Located in a nondescript shopping center in Mesa, the interior doesn't get much better than the outside. But you don't come here to be wowed by the interior design, even if you do think the plastic lobsters on the wall are pretty cool, it's all about the food.  Open the menu and within a few pages you'll see typical Chinamerica offerings, such as sweet and sour, lo-mein and fried rice. But keep turning the pages and you'll find some serious real deal Chinese food.  The best value is the Family Meal ($21.29), consisting of three large items, rice and noodles. This is a feast that can easily feed four or more.  Even more impressive is what the kitchen can do with fresh seafood. Across the street from ACE is Mekong Supermarket, an Asian grocer that has a massive fresh seafood counter. Diners can purchase fresh seafood from Mekong, then take it to ACE, where the chef cooks the catch for around $8 per item.  Our party of seven arrived at ACE with bags full of goodies we were greeted and seated, then a brief consultation began. We had purchased live seafood from Mekong's water tanks, including crab ($8.99 a pound), clams ($7.99 a pound) and two lobsters ($9.99 a pound). We also chose a large wide mouth bass ($8.99 a pound) that was cleaned by the Mekong fish monger.  Starting with the bass, the chef simply steamed the fish, then topped with a sauce of ginger and fresh spring onions. The fish was sublime -- fresh, meaty and tender without a hint of fishiness.  The clams were also steamed to perfection with a light sauce of black beans and spring onion. Each tender mollusk was a joy to eat with slight saltiness from the black beans.  Our crab was treated with a dredge of garlic, salt and pepper, then deep-fried. The chef was spot on, making a contrast between the luscious crab meat and the wonderful seasoning. While the crab was still in its shell, it was hacked up into more accessible pieces.  Finishing the feast, we \"oohed\" and \"aahed\" as our lobsters were brought to the table. Both lobsters were chopped into pieces, then stir-fried with green onion and ginger and served on top of a bed of crispy pan-fried noodles. They tasted as good as they looked. The lobster meat was so sweet and delicious I wanted to lick the plate clean. A bonus of flavor was hidden as the juices from the lobster were absorbed by the bed of noodles.  This was such a pleasant experience that I'd let the chef at ACE take the wheel for an evening of delectable surprises anytime.",

    "text": "This is another spot I ended up visiting with colleagues for a work lunch, having been much hyped before hand. There's really only two ways things can end up after that, either blown away or totally underwhelmed, at least in my experience. Long story short, it was the former.   While the place is small, unpretentious and definitely has a somewhat \"vintage\" look to it (or \"dated\", depending on whether or not you're the half-full or half-empty type), you can tell right away by the number of occupied tables and the continuous stream of people picking up take-out orders that this place is legit. A little further reading of the crowd will tell you that many of the people in there are regulars, based on their interaction with the staff, and that's typically a good sign.   The menu here is diverse, to the extreme, and you get a weighty tome handed to you when seated. There aren't many pictures in the menu, but they are literally dozens of them lining the walls of the restaurant, showcasing many of the dishes larger than life and in all their delicious glory. I was a bit overwhelmed by the massive menu, but if you find yourself in the same boat, take a look around at the walls for some of the more popular items. This is where I landed on my choice, their Yin and Yang fried rice dish, which comes with chicken in a tomato sauce and shrimp in a cream sauce.   The dish was excellent and perfectly cooked, and looked surprisingly close to the stock photo on the wall. It's actually quite a bit of food and the dish is deeper than it looks in the picture, so if you go this route, you'd best be hungry.   We did also sample a few of the appetizers on our visit, including the egg rolls, dumplings and crab puffs. All of it was fantastic and we actually wanted for more, despite the fact that we originally thought we'd ordered too much. It was that good!  I will admit the service pace was a bit below my expectation, but given how busy they were and the apparently small number of servers available to work the room, I can only really ding them one star for that, and I'd probably only do half if I could.   Overall, really great tasting, authentic Hong Kong style food in a small, no-frills, authentic setting that makes for a great lunch spot. It's too bad it's so far away from mainstream Phoenix, but it's definitely worth the drive if you're within reach. I will definitely go back next time I'm in the area.",

It took about ten minutes to get a table, but it took almost double that time to get a server's attention just so we could order. It was infuriating. We were told they were short-staffed, but it was hard to be empathetic when everything was so inefficient. When we were finally bought water, our server asked if we were ready to order and we were, so she was about to take our order when she noticed another customer waving her down. She hesitated, then asked if she could just go fill their waters. I stared at her, slightly appalled, and didn't respond. She left anyway and she proceeded to walk around the entire restaurant, refilled water cups (missing some customers), returned to the cashier counter, back to another table, back to the counter, took a sip of her soda, opened the drink fridge, put straws in her apron, and just waddled behind the counter. Oh, she still didn't return to take our order. Before I could get really upset, she sent another server to our table. Thank goodness. This server was very nice and actually seemed happy to be at work.  Spicy Salt Fried Pork Spare Ribs ($4.99): Fried pork spare ribs sauteed with garlic, green onions, special sauce, and chili oil. A bit salty, but otherwise tasty. The batter on the ribs was crunchy and the meat was tender and very flavorful.   Mapo Tofu with Minced Pork ($5.50): The flavor was different than what I'm used to or prefer, however, it was still really good. Nice kick of spice and the tofu was silky. Delicious with white rice.  Yang Chow Fried Rice ($7.75): This style of fried rice is the most similar to the Chinese-style fried rice in Hawaii. It wasn't overly salty and the rice was good. The ham was a little odd though. I would have liked char siu with the shrimp, peas, carrots, and egg.  Chow Fun with Pork ($7.75): The noodles were really good - perfectly chewy and worked well with the thinly-sliced pork, bok choy, and light sauce. Great flavor and seasoned well. We all really loved this dish.  Beef and Bok Choy ($7.75): This was supposed to be beef with Chinese broccoli, but they ran out (sad). The beef was very tender and the bok choy was cooked perfectly. The sauce was also very flavorful. Besides being slightly salty, it was a great dish!  Once we were fed, we were all in much better moods and momentarily forgot the the bad service in the beginning. Also, the service wasn't so terrible for the remainder of our meal. Not that we saw any of the servers often, but when we really needed water or rice, we were able to get their attention quickly. They also insisted on packing our leftovers for us which was nice. Overall, service was okay; rocky start, but finished strong. The prices are crazy cheap, especially for the quality! We were floored that our meal was under $40 (pre-tip). The five dishes filled us up and we had enough leftovers for three more meals! Bottom line is that if I lived in the area, I'd definitely stop by for my Chinese food fix. Also, if the restaurant is packed, maybe order take out.",

    "text": "Ok so decided to try this place out after reading all the reviews. Its sort of secluded in a empty plaza, a small hole in a wall i think but damn the food was gooooood! The family deal i got was 3 items to choose from and literally u choose any 3 ala carts not the ones they put together and if u want shrimp items its $2 xtra or fish items add $4 xtra. But they have a wide selection of food to choose from ala cart , lunch n dinner specials n some not even on the menu but they can cook it. I ordered the salt n pepper pork chops not on the menu but they cooked it cuz i seen that someone put it up on yelp n i showed them. It was ! The best chinese restaurant i found since i moved to Arizona, far from me like 30 minute drive but damn worth it...small venue so i can see it gettn packed fast but its worth it. The prices r fair n the portions is enough. Service was pretty good also. And if u like picture menus its all over the walls of the restaurant cuz sometimes u just wanna see the food. The fish with balck bean sauce was awesome! We had tons of left overs not like all the other chinese restaurants ive been to in PHX those r weak n portions suk ass. This place is worth trying if u are in the mesa area, and there is a big asian grocery store across the street at another plaza that u can buy asian stuff. I'd recommend this place for sure and I'd deff make a stop if im in mesa area again..outstanding food!! 2 thumbs up from me..",

Maybe everybody should visit QC reflexology before coming here. :-))  As soon as you walk in, one can tell this looks like a restaurant that serves an  AUTHENTIC Chinese foods.  I found a table and sat myself, however, it took over 6 minutes for a server to stop by. Then it took another 10 minutes for my ice tea and the menu.   It took another 20 minutes or so before my food started to show up on my table. The service was slow (took one star).  The food was great! Some of it reminded me of the foods I had tried back in Singapore. I ordered the following:  Fried Rice Steam Chicken Hot & Sour Soup Clams with Black Beans Special Noodle Soup  You can also bring your own Seafood and they will cook it for you. If you want, you could go across the street to Mekong and purchase Crabs or Lobster and bring them to this restaurant and they will cook it for you. I am going to try that.  Service is very slow so be prepared for it or do what I did, visit QC reflexology first, then you will be very relaxed.",

So finally, I did.  I have no idea about authenticity, but I do know it was delicious and cheap.  It was pretty crowded on the day we came in, but we found our own seat and waited a few minutes before menus were brought to us.  There are about a billion choices, all of them priced well under 10 bucks.  This place simply cannot be beat for value.    Absolutely clueless about what to order, I stuck with what I knew, and got the Orange Chicken Bowl, an egg roll and a can of soda that only cost 92 cents.  Our food didn't take too long, and my egg roll came out first.  It was so tasty!  It was packed full of good stuff and the sauce to dip it in was quite good.  My Orange Chicken Bowl came out in the shape of a plate.  I thought that was odd, but who really cares.  The orange chicken was really good.  It had a bright flavor and the sauce was just thick enough to cover the chicken properly.  The fried rice was the best fried rice I have ever had.  I still think about it actually.  I would definitely love to come back to this place, especially since it is right by the Light Rail.  Hopefully I will be better prepared to order something a little more adventurous next time.",

Flipping through the menu you can find Taiwanese food, Cantonese food, Shanghainese food,  and a myriad of others. This aside, however, Asian Cafe Express does a spectacular job despite its identity crisis.  The Cantonese food in this restaurant is fantastic. It's been a long time since I've been able to find some great food in the area, but this place knocks the socks off anything I've had.   The Taiwanese food in this restaurant is sub-par, but still acceptable compared to the other restaurants in the area given the fad of Americanized Chinese food.  Aside from my criticism of the Taiwanese food, this restaurant does a fantastic job both with the food and service. The decor is nonexistent, but I personally do not expect anything spectacular having come from Asia.",

They offer everything from fairly pedestrian Americanized Chinese food (lo mein, orange chicken, rice bowls) to authentic Hong Kong-style menu options.  Portions are plentiful and many dishes are seriously budget-priced - you can get a rice bowl for about $4.  My favorite dishes are tofu with black mushrooms and the veggie chow fun.

This place is one of the most filthy, disgusting, unsanitary places we have ever eaten.  Don't even get me started on the bathrooms, they are worse than most gas stations I've seen.  We were uncharacteristically ready to walk out the door before our waters even came.  However, we've been to places that weren't the most beautiful to look at but had wowed us with their food so we decided to give it a try.  We were already there and with 4.5 stars averaged with almost 200 reviews it had to be great, right?  Wrong!  We started with pork egg rolls (they were o.k.) and hot and sour soup (yuck).  We then ordered  different entrees including orange chicken, Kung Pao chicken, and chicken fried rice.  The only thing that wasn't completely nasty was the orange chicken but it certainly wasn't the best I've had.  The rest of the chicken was rubbery and full of fat/tendons.  We brought three other people with us and we were all staring at each other in disgust.  We will NEVER step foot in this place again!  The reviews have to rigged, it's the only explanation.",

Could of cut that down by half at least, was trying to drain the oil out.  Spicy Pork Noodle (on the wall pic) -- sweet and not very spicy, you'd like it if you're a fan of thick round white noodle dishes.  Salted Fish, Chicken & Tofu pot --  best of the bunch.

    "text": "First off, if you like ambience and decor, don't go here. If you like good Asian and Pacific Rim food, then do go here. These people do not, and I mean do not, f**k around with the good food they serve. What they lack in service, sometimes you got to wait longer than it takes to grow the food, they more than make up in what they do right and thats make good food from their respective origins. To boot, you always have enough to take home, now I know its american to over eat and one serving can serve an entire Vietnam family, but its good, to have some great lunch the next day. Tip: When you go in and see one table, get it. Smile at the lady, maybe even slightly bowing and make for that table. It can get crowded. Oh, and lots and lots of TOGO orders here for those who like TV or children with their food, hence the wait.",

    "text": "umm....no...this place is definitely not for us....  I've read all the positive reviews and was totally excited to try this place today.  We've been craving really good Chinese food that would satisfy our spoiled pallet from Cali.  \"Inexpensive, great food, nice service\"...sounded nice...  First of all, yes the service is really nice.  They were very relaxed and ready to serve you.  The order took around 15min for a take out which is pretty fast.    Second, the price....yes it is on the cheap side but is it really that inexpensive?  For example, compared to Phoenix Palace, most typical menu items are maybe ~$2.00 or so cheaper...but if you ask me, you are compromising the quality of the food for that few dollars you are saving.  Third, the food....OILY....really...OILY.   *Chili salt chicken wings = 5 pieces for $2.99.  Good price, dry, bland, not worth it. *Orange chicken = burnt, drowning in dark sauce, couldn't tell where the meat was... *XO sauce beef =....we found....6 pieces of beef slices and the rest was corn starch and onion mush...with orange colored oil all over. *Bean sauce chow fun with squid = this was the only ok dish.  Tons of squid which was cool, but not much chow fun at all...and again, oily.  Overall, we didn't like it.   Are we gonna go back = NO Maybe try again someday? = NO  *Location = good, right across the street from Mekong Plaza *Food = the extra $2.00 is so worth it at other restaurants. *Service = very nice *Decor = very plain",

    "text": "We ordered the family style dinner and it included 5 entrees, lo mein, egg fried rice and steamed rice for $34.99.  The twice cooked pork, sweet and sour pork and orange chicken were all fried and no vegetables.  These dishes were fantastic however, I didn't realize they do not include veggies so that was a major disappointment.  The chicken chow mein with crispy noodles would have been my favorite however, there was a communication problem when ordering.  I wanted it with chicken, celery, onion and bean sprouts only.  The waitress asked if I wanted bok choy and I said \"yes\".  She then said \"no bean sprouts?\"  So I said \"I want the bean sprouts instead of bok choy if I could only choose just one.\"  When the dish came out it was only chicken and bean sprouts.  Total disappointment!  I then realized that she was trying to say they don't have celery but have bok choy instead.  Chow mein is not chow mein without celery.  I loved the flavor of the sauce the chicken was amazing and the crispy noodles were the best I've had in a long time.  The broccoli beef was great.  The beef was flavorful   tender, and it included plenty of broccoli.  I would order it again.  The lo mein was fantastic and the egg fried and steamed  rice were good.  I see why so many people go here because we got soooooo much food for the price and it was overall good and I would definitely go back however I would order something else that wasn't fried and had veggies. If you like fried food and no veggies and get literally a PILE of food and have a PILE of food to take home with you, then this is the place to go.  Do not try to special order here or you may not get what you are asking for.",

But if you're looking for a clean, decent, VERY inexpensive Chinese restaurant with good food and friendly service, this is the place!  It's in a strip mall right next to a Subway deli if that gives you an idea of the ambiance.  It's usually full of Asian people which is always a good sign to me.  There are zillions of items on the menu, and while we've only tried a few of them, we have yet to try something that we didn't think was delicious.  The Beef Chow Fun with gravy is my favorite, but we also like the Chicken with Fresh and Black Mushrooms.  Sit down, or take out, you can't lose in this place.",

They have 2 menus: one with authentic Chinese/Hong Kong style food, and another with American \"Chinese\" food (eg. egg roll, orange chicken, beef broccoli, etc etc, which are what the low rating reviews were describing. why would you even eat American food at a Chinese restaurant anyway) You can buy your own fresh seafood from the Mekong supermarket across the street and this restaurant will cook it the way you want it (which is awesome because this makes it so much cheaper than seafood at other Chinese restaurants with their own fish tanks)",

I bumped it down due to multiple bad visits were the food was cold and/or soggy(ordering what I have always ordered: Orange Chicken special bowl and egg rolls).  With that said, I have always loved this place from the first bite!  While its interior is a bit dated, the food is fantastic and well priced.  Its so good that my positive visits out weigh the negative visits.  I could be wrong but I believe they were training a new chef at that time.  I would greatly recommend that people come and try some authentic Chinese food. (coming from someone that has visited china)",

    "text": "Finally! A well priced chinese cafe style place in Phoenix that is actually good!!!!!  To start off, don't expect a fancy setting or anything. It's straight up, no frillz asian style cafe decor. It's in an excellent location as it is across from the Mekhong Plaza, however, it's kind of hidden inside this plaza so you would have to look hard for it.  When you enter, you have all of their featured menus plastered on the wall. Awesome- shows nice pictures of the dish, name and price of it. It's good for folks who may not be familiar with certain dishes and would like a picture of what they are ordering.  The 1st thing that caught my eye was the Hong Kong menu. They actually served FRIED MILK!!!! For all those that wonder what the heck is fried milk, it's basically solidified milk and then they use flour to coat around the milk and fry it. It is a really interesting dish, probably not for everyone as the taste is probably more of an acquired dish. This dish however is really complex to make, so I was somewhat sceptical that they can make Fried Milk at this cafe. When the order came in, I was really surprised by the quality of it. The flour was not too thick, the milk inside was still soft enough and when you bit into it, the flavored gushed into your mouth. I loved it! Dip the fried milk into the sweet mayo dip and you have a winner!  I also ordered another great dish, Smooth beef with egg over rice. Their beef was perfectly fluffy ( I can tell they use the Baking Soda to soften up the meat first as the texture of it is very uniquely soft) and the thick white sauce with egg white was the perfect mixture over the rice. This dish was cheap, only $6 for such a large dish.   Their entire menu was generally from $5-9, so lot's of options to choose from. I am very happy to know this place exists and that Phoenix is slowly getting up to speed to the Los Angeles Chinatown quality.  Highly recommend this cafe if you want some good sized asian food at a budget price!",

I'll tell you what, I'd break my longstanding policy again because this place rocked my world.  Yes, it's a hole in the wall from the outside (and a little bit on the inside) but I've been around long enough to know that those places are usually the best.  This Hong Kong style Chinese food was hella cheap and totally delicious. I tried the orange chicken bowl (which was less than 4 bucks and freakin' enormous.) Plus some appetizers. I don't recall the names (sorry) but the bottom line is I tried a lot of stuff and all of it was divine.

My favorite, surprisingly, is the salty fish chicken fried rice. I don't normally order fried rice in restaurant and tend to go for authentic flavors. But, this fried rice is authentic and flavorful. Their hot pot dish with tofu and fish was also a must have!   I have not try it yet, but I heard you can also bring fresh seafood that you bought from the market (with recipe) to them. They will prep and cook the items for you with a small fee.   Can't wait to go back for some fried rice and seafood!",

Its Cantonese cruisine, fried with a wok and oil, definitely a little greasy.  I think they have decent american chinese food, like kung pao chicken, chow mien, terriyaki chicken bowl.  But what makes they stand out would be their huge menu of cantonese and asian food.    The owners are adventurous and would try making dishes from other countries other than HK, like they have their take on Hainanese Chicken Rice found commonly in Singapore and Malaysia.    I don't feel the quality of the food was compromised in anyway due to their lower price.   But due to their huge menu and having a large crowd, sometimes the standard varies a little.  Also, when the owner Michael is not cooking, sometimes his assistant makes a little different tasting dish.  I do recommend what I know.  Instead of Terriyaki Chicken, try their Curry Chicken Meat Rice, Instead of Mongolian Beef, try their Xo sauce Beef or if you dare to Bittermelon with Beef over rice.  Instead of Chow Mien, try their Beef Chow Fun.  Instead of Orange Chicken, try their HK style Sweet and Sour Pork.  Instead of a couple of meat dishes, try their Hong Kong style Grill, where U can order like 2 meats and they give u a soup, rice or spaghetti all for like 7 bucks.",

I'm from a place highly populated with Asians, Vancouver BC. Therefore I'd like to think I know good Asian food as I grew up on it. This place is up there with the best I've had. Mostly Hong Kong style cafe food. Hands down my favourite fried rice in the world is served here, salted fish and chicken fried rice. It might not be for everyone as the smell is very fishy but it's so delicious! Can't forget about the Hong Kong style milk tea! This place is truly a gem. The prices are great and the food selection is amazing. If I didn't live so far away I'd be way more often.",

Love Mongolian chicken! Spring rolls and red chili chicken wings are amazing appetizers!

I believe in diversity and humanity and because that person was not Caucasian or Asian; or even Asian like the family/people who work here, they didn't help them and was very rude to them for reason. This a family oriented place and this is a poor example to display to kids and other guests. I mean it's 2016 but some people are stuck in ignorance...This ruined my meal because the person did nothing and should have been treated like any other customer.

    "text": "My family is from Taiwan, and we visit our relatives every few years or so.  This place reminds me so much of Taiwan -- it's as authentic as it gets, people.  Even the restaurant is kind of grungy, which is exactly how most of those less expensive restaurants (but the most delicious, of course) are in Taiwan.  It's a hole in the wall that focuses on their flavors.  This place is perfect.  Every time my family visits me in Phoenix, we carryout from here.  You know this place is good because so many Asia-natives come here for food -- oftentimes, you hear more Chinese spoken from the tables than English.  Now, the service isn't superb.  It's actually kind of slow, but that's because they're always packed and so busy.  This is not five-star service.  If you're expecting five-star service, you may be better off dining somewhere else.  With that said, the food is spectacular.  My personal favorite is the stir-fried eggplant -- it's cooked with pork into this salty, sour mixture, and it's just mouth-wateringly good.  Their pan-fried noodles are delicious, as well, and I recommend any of their green vegetables, too.  Their XO beef is a favorite of the family.  The prices are phenomenal.  You can feed my six-member family almost two meals or so for about $50.  Their family deals can't be beat, so if you're catering for a family dinner or just a stay-at-home night with luxiouriously tasty Asian cuisine, this is the place for you.  If you're going to carryout, however, I recommend you call ahead.  All in all, if you're only interested in Americanized Chinese food, this probably isn't the place for you.  This stuff is authentic and just soulfully delicious.  I would highly recommend this place for its price, food, and overall value.",

    "text": "Friendly service, good portions, decent authentic Chinese food.  Highly recommend!  This little hole-in-the-wall has a very extensive menu spanning several different regional cuisines of China.  If you have a hard time deciding between the many different options, there are several different combination meals that will feed an army for a very good price.  We were in a spicy mood, so we ordered the Spicy Set Meal ($34.99), which included a large bowl of Tom Yum soup, 4 meat dishes (Satay pork, XO beef, water boiled fish, Szechuan chicken), and deep fried tofu in spicy oil.  Out of all the dishes, my favorite was the XO beef, which had a nice deep flavor with very tender beef.  The other meats were also very tender, and were actually not too spicy compared to the Tom Yum soup.  While the meat and the tofu was nicely cooked, the flavors of the dishes in general were just OK.   We finished all of our sizable bowl of soup, and attempted to eat our massive array of dishes, to find that even after eating as much as we could, it looked like we didn't even make a dent in any of the entrees! (A testament to the amount of food they give you in the combination meal)  Service was very prompt, and very friendly.  I'll definitely be coming back to try more of their dishes, especially the Hong Kong/Cantonese style dishes vs. the Szechuan and other spicy style dishes I had this time.",

We had our menus closed and were waiting to spend our money.   Alas, the Chinese wait staff served the Chinese customers who came in after us, so we ended up leaving and spending money elsewhere.   If you can wait more than 26 minutes to be checked on, and tolerate differential service that appears based on skin color and appearance, maybe this place is for you. It's not for us and I've removed it from my restaurant rotation. We'll have no problem finding solid Asian fare in this town.",

I ordered over the phone for pickup. I arrived promptly on time and the place was packed. It appeared five people were working the tables and front cafe with only one person who was manning the register area. There were several people waiting at the counter. One lady was waiting for pick up and it appeared she had been there a while. Finally (after about ten minutes with NO ONE even acknowledging us) she finally asked someone to give her her food. They helped her and moved on while the rest of us are left standing there. After waiting another five minutes I asked a lady to help me out.   Got my food and headed home, had to reheat my food. I had ordered Mongonlian Beef, Fried Rice and steamed dumplings. Decent food and for a good price (my total meal was under $10 and it was probably enough for two people) but the service was really bad. I shouldn't have to wait 15 minutes to pick up my order. Not sure if I'll be back here.",

I read the reviews on yelp before I went hoping this would at be acceptable Asian food but instead I got flavorless noodles, tofu and cabbage.  3 leaves of cabbage isn't vegetables.  The entire meal isn't worth $3 let alone $8.  The service is terrible, the food horrible, over priced and bland.  Maybe if you don't know how to make the noodles or fry tofu you could be tricked into thinking they gave you something of value but the same noodles are $.50 across the street at Mekong, the tofu $1 and I am fairly certain the cabbage they would give you for free.  I called once we got home and they defended their product.  I will never go here again and I suggest you do the same. I actually opened this yelp account today just to write this review.",

I tend to look for Chinese take-out to eat in my hotel room. I feel too pathetic to sit in a restaurant all alone eating so would rather work while I eat.   Found this place with the help of Arizona local on Yelp. I was really not prepared for what I found since as I was driving to it, it seemed to be a largely Hispanic area I was driving through. I was worried I was going to find a place specializing in Chung King Chow Mein or another Westernized equivalent. Much to my surprise, I found a strip mall small restaurant with good parking and a hodge-podge of visual food images on the wall with some really authentic stuff. This, coupled with a fairly busy kitchen and wait staff hustling to chop tofu and serve tea in a dining room that really had no decor but was full of Chinese people and my interest radar went up immediately. Panda Express this is not.   The first few pages of the menu do have all the standard Western favorites but towards the end, you are rewarded with a \"Hong Kong\" style menu and it has a lot of great stuff on it. Scrambled eggs and Bitter Melon, Chicken Fried Rice with Salted Fish, and great looking seafood dishes too! Upon placing an order, I sat and waited and could hear the kitchen staff yelling things at each other in Chinese (just like in Hong Kong) and knew that things were going to turn out all right.   This is a great little find with affordable prices and large portions. In addition, the authenticity is awesome for being in the middle of the desert southwest! The staff was very friendly and clearly hard-working. It is now on my list of definite recommendations when in the PHX area!",

We had the pork egg rolls, the pork dumplings, and the chile salted chicken wings.  All delicious!  For the meals, we had pork fried rice, beef and broccoli, and the Hong Kong Chinese broccoli and beef.  Again, all was delicious!!  You get a ton of food, so we were able to take some home for leftovers.  Wonderful place to eat!",

Has taken me 25 years of living in Phoenix to find Chinese food of this quality and authenticity. They are incredibly friendly and very quick. The place is very simple and if you are looking for elegance, go somewhere else. If you are looking for quality food at really good prices, you will never be disappointed here. My nephews also live in New York and love to come eat here when they visit. We usually get the $30 Family Meal which is three entrees and rice and lo mein. Numerous options, incredibly polite people, excellent food, great prices. Give it a try it and if you don't like it write and yell at me!  I forgot to mention that without fail, I always get the black pepper chicken. I end up sharing half of it with whomever I am there with as it is one of their best dishes. If you like spicy in a flavorful way, highly recommend you try the black pepper chicken.",

    "text": "A very unique chinese restaurant. The menu was very authentic and it had a ton of dishes that were specific to certain regions in China. The menu catered to groups of 2 all the way up to large groups or party's. They also have an option for you to bring in your raw seafood and they will cook it for you. We tried the hong kong style chicken chow mein, pork fried rice, steamed dumplings, the beef egg soup, sweet and sour pork, and beef with broccoli. The noodles were perfectly crispy and the sauce/gravy was very flavorful. The rice was tasty and you got a lot of the mix-ins so it wasn't just rice. We ordered the sweet and sour chicken but they brought pork which was fine since it was still good. The steamed dumplings were very good and the dipping sauce was yummy. The beef was tender and the vegetables crunchy. The soup was very filling and unlike anything I have ever ordered at a chinese restaurant.",

The shredded pork with sour vegetables soup is just the way I like it, salty, sour, and savory. The bitter melon beef is savory, rich, and slightly bitter. I'm torn between the salted fish and chicken fried rice and beef with lettuce fried rice -- both are wonderful. The short ribs in black bean sauce are slightly sweet and plenty savory. An iced coffee with milk tea on a hot day is great. Don't eat here expecting Imperial cuisine. But you might see the owners' kids seated at a table doing their homework -- or helping take orders. What a gem this little restaurant is.",

It serves up authentic Cantonese fare in a no-muss no-fuss manner. Essentially, the food is like experiencing a home-cooked meal in Hong Kong.  Particularly good are the Hong Kong style rice plates, the hot pots, and pan fried or soup noodles. The bitter melon and taro dishes, like the congees (rice porridge), are off-the-beaten-path of most Chinese eateries and are also solid.  True, you won't find fish/shrimp tanks or hanging roast pork/BBQ ducks here, alas, and the menu description of brown/light sauces don't exactly scream sophisticated.  But the food is tasty -- and especially good given the portions and prices.  Be prepared to wait when they get slammed. The service can be hit and miss in those moments, but the staff is earnest and kind.   The place is as tried and True as any Chinese restaurant in town.",

Take a look at the picture- it's overflowing w/ red beans + it pairs well with the food. Also, try the Yin Yang drink (milk tea & coffee).

I ordered Japanese BBQ pork noodles soup. My food came about 10 minutes after ordering.  When I saw my food at first, the portion wasn't big, but once I started eating, I was wrong. Lots of pork and noodles. I wish they put some veggies. However, the broth had enough seasoning as well as pork.  The service and staff were okay. Nothing great. The prices were very reasonable.

I totally understand your misjudgment on this restaurant because you don't know what the real Chinese food is like. The only good thing about this place is the portion. They do have a decent size of portion, but other than that, nothing! I seriously doubt if chef had any training in cooking at all. Any immigrant from China fresh off the boat can go into their kitchen and cook a better meal. We were party of two and ordered their combo meal which had three entrees and one stir fried vegetable. We ended up finished half of the food and didn't bother to box them as they are really worthless and tasteless. The food tasted like any cheap Chinese buffet so you can get a picture of what's their food like!",

The food is super authentic, everything tastes just like my mom's food (perhaps a tad saltier on some trips), and the value is insane. I've come with as many as 8 people and spent less than $100 total for dinner + a ton of leftovers. Usually we'll get one of the family meal variations and add on a few other dishes depending on the size of the party and/or what everybody feels like eating. A must-have dish that we always order is the salt and pepper squid, fried perfectly on the outside and soft on the inside with a little kick to it - I'm not ashamed to say that I usually scoop up all the little fried bits that are leftover and eat  it with rice.  Staff is always super friendly here and ordering is easy, even in English. Service can be a tad slow at times because there's usually only one or two servers working the whole restaurant, although the food comes out very quick once your order is in.  I was a little worried they had changed the menu based on another review here, but I'm happy to report that isn't the case as of June 2018.",

Well priced, and great food.  Service is usually quick and polite as well.  Not many options for those with egg allergies as they use egg in their meat marinations.

    "text": "I have not had other Chinese or Asian cuisine in the Phoenix area so the review is in comparison to the Bay Area and the reality that there is a relatively small Asian population in the area. The waitress (most likely owner) was really sweet. She recommended a stir fry with bok choi, beef, chicken, shrimp, tofu, and shitake mushrooms. Basically the kitchen sink. We also ordered gai lan sauteed with garlic and salty/peppery deep fried chicken. The stir fry and veggies were a bland version of traditional chinese home cooking. The fried chicken which is normally very salty was a mixture of sweet and savory. The cold milk tea was decent.   As previous posts have mentioned before, the decor is nonexistent. It looks like a Subway with the booth seating except the color palate is pink.",

Our tilapia was steamed with scallions, ginger and cilantro. Thank you for leaving the face on our fish. To some it's creepy but to us it was necessary. Our catfish was fried and seasoned with just the right amount of spice with tasty crunchy bits at the bottom of the plate. Our lobster was amazing! I don't recall the prep style we selected but it was painfully delicious.  We also selected a noodle option and steamed rice to accompany our meal.  A very very good meal prepared by very good people.  See you soon!",

I've had traditional Chinese food in chinatowns in San Francisco, New York, Philadelphia and elsewhere, and I can tell you that Asian Cafe Express is a real stand-out.  No, it's not Cantonese or Sichuan haute cuisine, but I'll take the authentic, traditional Chinese home cooking of this place any day.  Great food at absurdly low prices.  Everything I had was excellent.  In most traditional Chinese restaurants, low price = small portions and/or very poor quality food.  Not here.  What a great place.  I knew I was in for a treat when I walked in.  I was the only non-Asian patron.",

Finding a great Chinese restaurant in AZ is seemingly impossible.  After four years of searching, I started to give up.  Through the help of Yelp, I found this place and decided to give this place a try.  I pretty much get the same two items every time I'm there, combo fried rice and beef satay egg noodle soup.  I will also experiment with one other item from time to time.  I've never been disappointed and on average each item is only $5.00 and if it's just yourself or sharing with one other person, there will be plenty of leftovers.  Great food with leftovers for $10.00!  Also, I'll get Tapioca with Boba from time to time and that's great too.    The service is also very good here.  Always attentive to needs (like refilling water cups) and the food comes out quickly enough and well prepared.  It's clear that English is a second language for the waitresses, but I've never had any problems.  Yes, the place is a hole in the wall and a bit dumpy, but the food makes up for it 100 times over.    The place is a bit far from me, but I do make my way out there at least once a week and I haven't gone to any other Chinese restaurant in AZ since discovering this GEM!",

The food is so good.  If you're going for the ambiance, you won't find it.  The restaurant is something out of the 60's 70s or 80s with plastic on most of the chairs (other than the booths).  But, I could care less.  I'm not really focusing on the design -- it's mostly the friends I'm with and the food I'm eating.  If you're looking to spend $10 on food that will likely last you three days, it's a bang for your buck.  Check it out and you'll see.",

I never had to ask for more water because they were always filling my glass without interrupting my conversations. The food options are extensive! The menu has a lot to choose from, and I like pork dishes the most, so it was nice to see that I had options when it came to those. I ordered the 10 dumplings for $2.99, and I had them make them with pork. They are a great deal. They may not fill up someone who has a large stomach, but they are the perfect amount for my tiny appetite and my wallet. I also tried the twice cooked pork, and it was good. It reminded me a bit of the kind of food one might get at Panda Express in terms of texture, but the redeeming quality was the sauce. It was sweet and spicy, and it really made the dish. Overall, this is a great Asian place that offers a lot of options to choose from for a good price. I'm definitely going to miss being able to walk down the street to eat here now that I've moved!",

I've dined in once and gotten carry-out twice and each time the food has been fabulous! I highly recommend the Creamy Chicken and Corn Soup (disclaimer: I add a little salt to it), Chili Sauce Chicken Dumplings (these are actually really salty - which I like), Beef and Vegetables with Brown Rice (SO good), and Boba Tea! The menu can be a bit overwhelming at first (as there are actually menus within the menu...if that makes any sense!), but now that I know what I want I don't have to worry. Haha. I'd be interested in trying other dishes, but seriously, the beef and vegetables are so delicious I can't bring myself to stray from them yet. I've even had leftovers that tasted better the next day.

My father had been eating at Gourmet House since the 80s, and I grew to love it as well, although it was a bit of a drive from where I lived. When he told me the owners sold it and opened their own place in Mesa, closer to my digs, I was pumped. He told me the menu was different, and I became worried that my favorite, Hunan Beef, would not be on the menu. Unfortunately it's not, but I still ask for the Hunan Beef every time, and lucky for me they are happy to oblige.   The menu is huge, gigantic really, with a whole section on Hong Kong style cuisine. I regretfully have not yet tried as many items on the menu as I would like, since I always want my favorites, but this would definitely be the place to branch out and try something new. Baby bok choy greens with garlic sauce, hot and sour soup, fried rice, Mongolian beef, sesame chicken, lo mein, all the classics are delicious! Very inexpensive, including lunch bowl portions of favorite dishes with rice for under $5. My friends who are now in San Francisco curse me every time I send them a photo of the food with their telltale plate design.",

He had the Japanese Beef and Broccoli and I had the Chicken fried rice. I'm not a fan of cooked broccoli so I didn't taste his. But it sure did look good. He said it was delicious. My fried rice was some of the best I have ever had. The portions for both of us were huge, so we brought the rest back to take home with us. The place doesn't stand out from the street view, so you have to be in the lookout for it in a strip mall. Not a huge place, especially when we saw the lunch crowd come in a fill the place up. But, it's not so small you feel cramped either. Prices were reasonable and lunch for the two of us was under $20.",

    "text": "I so miss Asian Cafe Express. I didnt realize how much i would miss it since moving away over a year ago. I would dine here once a week some times more. The food at Asian Cafe Express is delicious, portions are very good and prices are great. Looking at their menu i see they raised their prices a little. And its still a great bargin.   For drinks i usually ordered taro coconut w/ tapioca.  For my meal i would generally get bok choy with black mushrooms or double mushroom with bok choy or with mixed vegetables. And the use whole black mushrooms not sliced black mushrooms or tiny pieces,whole ones. I make this point because ive been to some restaurants in my new city and i havent found one chinese restaurant that offers black mushrooms and if the do they slice them up into halfs or small pieces.  I would also some times order ginger green onion w/fish fillet, chinese broccoli.w/fish fillet. Or just and order of bok choy or chinese broccoli. They never over cooked the vegetables and the vegetables were always in abundance. Yum!  Reguardless what you order at Asian Cafe Express if it includes vegetables you can rest assured they will not be cheap or mizerly with the veggies the will give you a generous amount of veggies (not over cooked). It wont be just some tiny broccoli florets and carrots. And the vegetables will be mixed in throughout your whole plate.   The atmosphere at ACE is relaxed its not at all pretentcious or posh. Simple, clean and not worried about designer tables or posh art on the walls. Working class, builders, laborers, any office workers. Comfortable for all. Great place for very good food.   Im still searching but so far i havent found any thing as good as Asian Cafe Express in my new home.",

    "text": "Interesting. I have been wanting to try this place out for quite awhile. It is located in a older shopping center that is missing the main grocery store. Easy to drive right past. Inside is a no frills situation but casual. There are colorful pictures on the wall of some of the exotic dishes to point at when ordering which I did. In addition there are more specials written in Chinese hanging on the walls.  Giant selection of food to choose from with both American and Hong Kong style menus. I was mainly interested in the selections that I have seen in Chinese cookbooks that I own that are not written in English or poorly translated. I have been here a few times now for lunch.  Started off with some Spicy Dumplings and then tried the Szechuan Spicy Water Boil Fish which was really tasty. They make their own hot sauce and have it in a jar on the table for extra heat. Also tried the XO Sauce Beef stir fry once with Chili Salt chicken wings on the side which was good. Today the Black Mushroom, Fish Fillet and Tofu Hot Pot with a couple of egg rolls on the side. I think I'm hooked on Hot Pots. Giant portions of food for a reasonable price.  Check out their web site for the dish of the week.You can actually bring your own seafood and they will cook it for you. Nice!  Service is friendly and quick although I get there when they open. Place can get a little dirty at times in certain areas. Just need a little touch up once in a while. Good thing the Wok is really hot. See you there next time. CHOP CHOP!  3.5 Stars",

Unbeatable. Two can eat a large meal and have two full leftover meals for 25 bucks (that's with a $5 tip). Don't let the noisy and somewhat uncomfortable first impression turn you away, the service, value and quality are unmatched in my experience. Any fried chicken, orange, generals, any lo mein, rice, egg rolls, spring rolls you really can't go wrong here. Oh, and don't let me forget that the menu is longer than a Tolkein novel.. GET DOWN!",

We ordered the egg fried rice, chicken fried rice, vegtable low mein, the mongolian beef, an order of egg rolls and crab puffs and it came to $26 and some change.   They had the food ready in about 15 minutes and that was with 3 orders ahead of ours! The food was ok. Lacked in flavor on everything but it wasn't bad. I just put on some more salt and I was good. The beef was more onions then beef but my husband said it wasn't too bad. The fried rice was pretty good, just needed some more added salt.  I love boboa so when I saw they had it I was excited but they don't have any flavors of tea. Just a milk tea that to me tastes like coffee. Good but not what I wanted.   All in all if we are in that part of town and wanting some chinese food we might stop in again. Worth a try though!",

I had some items from the AZ menu like the Chicken Broccoli & Fish Fillet and got to try the Mapo Tofu from the regular HK menu. The service could be improved however as it does take a while to sit down and order some food. Other than that though the food does come out quickly. There was an instance where after ordering some take-out from them I was waiting for at least 15-20 minutes, they realized that the ticket was left on the floor. It didn't bother me much since they seemed very busy that night and also I wasn't in much of a rush. At least they were very apologetic about the situation and offered me to grab a drink from the fridge free of charge.  I thought their Mapo Tofu was very good and the portions were larger than expected. The Chicken Broccoli was not too bad and I thought it was decent compared to some other places that I have been to. Fish Fillet could have been better but it was still satisfactory. Overall I would definitely make my way back there considering how great the prices are for everything.",

I understand that the dish that I order isn't something that is usually on the menu at chinese restaurants but they should still know how to make it, everyone else has up until now. I asked them if they could make general tsos tofu and the lady at the register said yes. I was given a tray with tofu and general tsos sauce and white rice on the side. The dish didn't come with onions, broccoli or anything. It was just tofu, the sauce and rice. I asked for the sauce to be spicy and it wasn't and it didn't even have much of a taste to it and to make matters even worst I'm pretty sure there was little tiny pieces of chicken mixed in with the tofu. It had a different texture and taste from the tofu. I'm a vegetarian, I can't be eating chicken!! It was 10 bucks for one of the worst dishes I've ever had. The tofu was way too soft. I asked for fried tofu! Every other chinese spot makes the general tsos tofu crispy not super soft like this place did it. Horrible chinese food here. I'm from New York City and I know good chinese, stay away from this place!",

They are very kind and work very hard to make you happy. I've dined with acquaintances who don't necessarily have the best manners and nothing can take away the smile and generosity of the wait staff.  I haven't ordered anything that disappointed but were maybe a bit out of my taste or comfort zone. I keep a running list of what I have and have not ordered because there are so many options.   My always order or go-tos are:  Ginger with green onion tofu fish fillet Hong Kong sweet sour pork rib Braised mushroom with tofu and bok choy Salt and pepper fried squid And anything with XO sauce (this is a little light on the spice but nothing some extra chili oil from the table can't help)",

    "text": "This place got fantastic reviews and I DON'T KNOW WHY. The staff was very friendly and the service was quick but I thought the menu choices seemed rather lacking for such raving reviews. My husband is Chinese and we eat a lot of Chinese. We came from living in the San Francisco Bay area and are very familiar with very good Chinese. His mother also makes Chinese at home.  We ordered the family meal which comes with rice and lo mein. I also ordered the hot and sour soup and the vegetable spring rolls. The hot and sour soup was bland and rather tasteless. It was also very thick and gummy. This spring rolls were like they came out of a package. The other dishes we ordered were beef with broccoli, chicken and vegetables and tofu and vegetables. I saw pictures on other reviews on this site that showed gai lan and there was nothing like that on the menu I was offered. So perhaps I was given the white people menu.  Sadly we know that there are good Chinese restaurants in Mesa and have been reluctant to try new places because we have a couple of places where we can get OK Chinese food. With such rave reviews I thought for sure that this place would be an easy place to pick up something on my way home from work.  When I am looking for an authentic Chinese food restaurant I expect to see lots of sauteed vegetables, especially bok choy, gai lan and cabbages. This to me seems more like a garden-variety bad white people American Chinese food buffet. I wish I didn't have to leave such a scathing remarks as the staff was quite nice but I just feel that the quality of the food that I was served was poor and the taste was very in authentic.  I am also quite sad because it seems like several of the reviews are not accurate and the pictures appear to be taken by a professional so I suspect that these were hired by the restaurant in order to put good reviews.  I hope to find a better restaurant to find real authentic Chinese food in Mesa soon.",

My friend and I were visiting the Phoenix area last weekend and I had Asian Cafe Express bookmarked.  We made our way and ordered from their VERY large menu.  My first impression was the cleanliness of the restaurant.  The front door and windows were really dirty.  OK, I get it, not really something that effects the meal.  I made my way to the restroom, which is also used as a storage room, and it was dirty.  That automatically makes me wonder how clean the kitchen is.   We ordered, after taking at least ten minutes to review the lengthy menu.  I appreciate having options but they are all over the place.  I copped out and ordered sweet and sour chicken with fried rice and an order of pot stickers.  My friend ordered the asian noodle soup.  She used to have this soup when she lived in New York.  My pot stickers came out and they weren't even the quality of the frozen pot stickers you can buy at Costco.    My S&S was bland and the fried rice was dry and unappetizing.  My friends soup had large pieces of pork (which is a good thing) but it wasn't BBQ pork and had no flavor either.  The portions are large but if the food isn't appealing, it doesn't matter.  Reasonable prices, large portions, questionable cleanliness, food that isn't edible = never going back again.  It doesn't happen often, but my Yelpers let me down this time.",

The number one rule of dive diners is: \"Go Where The Locals Go\" Sure enough, police cars, local diners and Cantonese is the main llanguage spoken. Look at the pictures on the wall and point, or better yet, ask the people seated what they recommend!! I wanted pork and eggplant, shrimp with lobster/black bean sauce and sure enough, they cooked it right up.  No. The eggplant is NOT on the menu. I'm guessing a few other items I'm used to eating probably aren't posted as well. If you've had Cantonese cooking in LA, the Bay area, Seattle, or in the Islands, you need to go eat here.  Asian Cafe Express is located in Mesa on Main and Dobson. Expect to wait a bit if you have a large party. Otherwise, they will cram you into any space they can to get you seated. If you're reading this review, you'll see quite a few 5 stcases from other elites. You'll also see some 1 and 2 star reviews. Yup. Local diners will occasionally miss the mark on customer service, communication and ambiance.  Go see for yourself. You wont be disappointed.",

The decor is not the most lavish, but it's the best around when it comes to food. There are tons of dishes to choose from! They seem to expand their menu from time to time to keep our visits fresh. However, if you feel a little overwhelmed and don't know what to order, I recommend bringing a handful of friends to order the \"Set Dinners.\" The owners have already grouped a variety of dishes that nicely complement each other and they sell it as a 6-course meal. It will feed 6+ guests easily. I have been coming to Asian Cafe for about a decade now; the food is consistently good, and the service is outstanding. My parents and siblings come from the Guangzhou/Hong Kong area, and this style of Cantonese food is an important part of our cultural heritage. These days, intense and spicy Northern Chinese joints have overtaken the subtle elegance of Cantonese food. I truly appreciate a restaurant like Asian Cafe Express that expertly promotes the cuisine of my roots in America.",

Asian Cafe Express is definitely one of those restaurants that will at least alleviate some of my hunger pangs for Asian food, after moving over from Los Angeles in good ole' Southern California, where Asian food abounds in the San Gabriel Valley. It is not the best-tasting Chinese food that I've ever had, but it will suffice, since there aren't nearly as many options here in Phoenix.  I've been to Asian Cafe Express a number of times already, and there seems to only be the two usual waitresses who are busily serving a ton of patrons. This place definitely can get packed, but the food is served rather quickly. The service isn't super top-notch, and the decor isn't the most modern, but I can excuse that, because the food quality and quantity is decent. I also often speak to the waitresses in Cantonese, because they tend to understand me better when I order specific items or have particular questions about the dishes. One qualm I do have about the take-out food is that the abundant sauce from the dishes tends to spill out from the take-out box and into the enclosed bag, so it can get quite messy when taking the food out to eat.  All in all, I definitely will return with a hungry appetite!",

I had tried this place before, but only for a light snack while my tire was being fixed. It looked intriguing enough that I kept it in the back of my mind for quite a while. Unfortunately, the decor kept me from rushing back (I don't have many adventurous foodie friends).  I should state now that the owners are the former owners of the Gourmet House of Hong Kong -- so I'm sure most of the food here is done in the Hong Kong style. (But I don't know much about Chinese regional cooking).  The other night we decided to check the place out for dinner. I am glad we did.  We ordered chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, pepper beef, orange chicken and a chicken rice bowl for the kiddo.  The service was spectacular -- our waitress (one of the owners) brought crackers for our daughter to eat (after dinner we went to the Asian supermarket across the street and bought a box of the crackers) and was otherwise wonderful with us. Some of the best service I've had in a very long time.  Physically, the place is bland. It's not home-y, but it does remind me of hole-in-the-wall faster food places abroad.  The food, on the other hand, is fantastic. Like I said, my food companions are not very adventuresome (chicken fried rice, sweet and sour chicken, orange chicken). I tried the pepper beef on suggestion by our waitress.  Every single person (including the three-year old) was blown away by the taste of the food. I really can't say much more.  It's very convenient to the Sycamore/Main Light Rail Station -- this should be on every foodie/light-rail rider's menu.",

    "text": "I've never tried this place before so I went for the first time last night. I ordered a beef dish, fried rice and crab wontons with cream cheese to go. The place was packed, but it had a dirty feel to it and a lot of dirty dishes were stacked in tubs behind the counter. What really disturbed me, though, was that while I was waiting for my food near the register, I had a full view of what was happening in the kitchen since there was no partition. Right in front of the entrance, the cook took out three huge blocks of boneless, frozen chicken parts onto the counter. After sitting they'd thawed a few minutes, I watched him feed them through a deli slicer, into small blocks, presumably to be thawed and cooked up, fat and all. I did not get the impression that the meat was or would be carefully inspected before being cooked. I know a lot of restaurants probably prepare meat that way, but the mass qualities of untrimmed meat I saw being served made me really lose my appetite. When I got home, my wontons smelled really fishy (like they'd been cooked and sat out for a while) and the sauce on my beef was just slimy enough that anything left of hunger quickly fled me. So basically I spent $13 to eat a carton of rice. Their prices are not cheap enough to warrant visiting this place over a quality establishment. Will not be returning.",

The curry sauce was from a mix and not at all spicy, but the potatoes in the dish were steak fries that were worked into the sauce. Overall I liked it, but probably wouldn't order again. My partner got the beef lo-mein which was quite greasy. After conversing with the people who recommended the place, apparently they only go there for the wonton soup, so I think we will try that next time, and maybe one of their $3.79 plates.

As a Vegetarian it is sometimes hard to find restaurants I can go to without feeling like a burden by special ordering dishes. I noticed there was a number of dishes I could order here which is always nice.   We also tried their Coconut/tapioca drink which was amazing, and more importantly for me not overwhelmingly coconut tasting. I wish I could have tapioca in everything now! It was very filling, so don't order if you have a small appetite! They also brought it out in a plastic to go cup with a lid and straw which was nice since we were able to take it with us.   The only complaint I have is that the rice came out in an uncovered bowl, which meant it got a bit dry as it sat there, which was kind of annoying but not a big deal.   As for groups, it is a small place, with maybe like 8 normal 4-6 person booths, and like 6 or so 4 person square tables so I don't think they could handle too big a group, though not really sure as I only got one look at the dining room.",

    "text": "Ok... so I know I only went here a few days ago.... but hey! I'm sick and in need of lots of asian soup. So the BF and I went here tonight to get some cheap foods and it just didn't measure up to last time. We got the chili dumplings and I thought they were just ok.... I couldn't taste the meat over the chili, so I didn't really like that....the pork flavor is the best part! Next time maybe I'll go for regular pork and veg dumplings. The BF, however, really liked the dumplings so to each his own. We also got a spring noodle soup due to its cheapness and simplicity. Well now I know why it is so cheap. First off, I was expecting an individual sized soup... like a cup, cuz it cost 2$, but no... it was a giant bowl! Normally I wouldn't complain, except that the food inside the bowl wasn't very good or flavorful. The noodles were like thick spaghetti.... mushy and flavorless. The broth was also quite bland.... just a bit salty. And that's all there was. So, I know it's probably my fault and a misunderstanding, but I thought even though it said it had no meat and no veg,  it would still have some kind of seasoning. I wish they would serve a really good flavorful broth with more delicate noodles.... still no meat or veg.... for the same price... and just make the portion a normal portion for one person. Anyway, it's not that big a deal, I just wouldn't order that item. We also got the black bean spare ribs which were ok, but not as good as the other day when I tried my friend's spare ribs.... maybe due to them being busy. I think they just put too much black bean sauce on today and it made it kind of salty. Soooo tonight's visit gets an 'ok' but since the other day's visit was so good, I evened them out and went with four stars.",

Granted, it's not THE BEST food i've ever had, but it's good, and did i mention how cheap it is? I think almost everything is under $6. It's fun because the menu also offers a bit of a variety of different asian cuisines.   i recommend the beef stew curry. mostly because it comes in its own little mini wok, which is SO FREAKIN CUTE! oh yeah, it tastes good too.",

I was not disappointed!  This place serves up the best Chinese food in Arizona, easily..... and for CHEAP.  You would be hard pressed to find a dish over $7.  Do yourself a favor when you get the menu and just skip the first three pages until you start seeing \"Hong Kong Style xxxxxxxx\" and start there.  They have truly authentic Cantonese / Hong Kong style cuisine with dishes I have never seen anywhere else.    I have had probably 8 different items there so far and each one was AMAZING.   Try something out of the ordinary, you won't be disappointed.  Also, you have to try a Chow Fun dish.  It's a MUST.  I have never tasted Chow Fun as good as they have it.... it's crazy how good their Chow Fun is, no joke.  Two words of caution..... sometimes the English translation of the items is not exactly the same as the Chinese translation... obviously the chef uses the Chinese translation, so do yourself a favor and confirm the choice with the waitress.  For instance, their \"Black Pepper Sauce Chow Fun\" is actually Chow Fun with Black Bean sauce with green peppers.  Not a big deal since everything is excellent, but just so you know.  Second word of caution.... you WILL get addicted to this food!  You have been warned.  :)",

I've had the Japanese bbq pork with egg over rice dish (I think that's what it's called) and, while I didn't have high expectations for it, it was surprisingly good.  The Wonton Noodle soup is probably one of the best dishes here.  Might be on the salty side for some, but that's how I like it.  The Singapore rice noodles (can't remember the english name so I'm improvising) were pretty good as well, in all it's curry-noodley goodness.  Overall, you can't really go wrong with this place.

The Mongolian beef, for example, leaves a little tingle on your lips, but it never feels hot.

However, for $3.33 they gave me a huge amount of spicy chicken, which I barely could finish (but wasn't going to waste!) As far as value, this kicks the kung pao out of Panda or any chain Chinese...   There are so many dishes here it would take a year to try all of them.  I like americanized asian, but if you love authentic chinese they have that here as well, as everyone around me was eating things I have never seen before...  I'm never going to Panda again.",

Pages and pages of menu items, but most of the time I just get something off of the first page - the \"special bowl.\" It is a pretty decent amount of really good food for $3.98. There are about 15 different options on this all day, every day deal and I have yet to be disappointed. I got it to-go for the first time today and I think they gave me even more than when I eat there as the standard sized to go box was overflowing with rice, chicken, and vegetables. Check out the appetizers, too. 10 steamed dumplings for $2.99 is practically a meal in itself! Do yourself a favor and check this place out!",

Their stir fried chow fun (rice noodle) is good, the boys tend to Really enjoy hunan beef. They also have this specialty fried rice topped with dry fish flakes.

I got the sweet and sour pork once and it wasn't as good,; a bit more dry, and one time I tried the egg rolls and crab puffs and both were amazing.

He told me that I had to try to this place as it was one of the best places he had Mongolian Beef--ever! At first I could not find the restaurant and thought that maybe it had closed. But, after driving past the Subway and looking up I finally found it. I was extremely hungry and walked as quickly as I could to the back where the check out counter was. I had to wait for a few minutes as the wait staff was running around trying to fill orders in the cramped and crowded dining area. The dining area has about 15 tables and depending on how many folks are sitting at the table you may or may not be able to get by. Finally one of the waiters acknowledged me and I ordered the large shrimp and vegetables, which with tax only totaled $8.50.   I decided to take a seat and immediately a waitresses acknowledged me and tried to hand me a menu. I explained to her that I was just sitting waiting for my order--she smiled and moved on. The restaurant is very small and packed full of people--but for the price and food it is worth being a little cramped. All of the food on their tables looked amazing. I waited for about 10 minutes for my food and it was so worth the wait. The shrimp and vegetables were lightly covered in a white sauce and it was all piping hot. There were large chunks of broccoli and carrots--unfortunately you could barely see the 10-12 little shrimp floating around; but it was a great meal. I will definitely be coming back in a couple of weeks to sit in and enjoy their food.",

The food is SO good and everything tastes like it is perfectly seasoned and it's almost like you can taste the flavors of the pans they use with this light smokey taste a well seasoned wok produces.  The veggies are always fresh, meats are perfectly cooked and coated with layers of flavor.  That's it!  It has layers of flavors that makes this place a one of a kind place.

You must have heard that the Chinese restaurants here in the U.S are very different from the restaurants in China. The food they have, is very similar to my hometown, Guangzhou, China, which is the south. Their menu also has north, east, south (sweet) and west (spicy) China style food. Very impressed! If you have some friends want to try out Chinese food, you should bring them here. They have some combos, you can choose different kind of favor. I usually order the one which is Hong Kong style combo. It comes with soup, fried rice, chicken, beef, and fish. A lot of food right? Do you think those cost $50 or above? No, they are like $34 - $38. If you are looking for a romantic place for a date, that is the wrong place. This restaurant does not have dim lights like P.F. Chang. They are just like a typical Chinese restaurant. They have bright lights so you will be able to see what kind of food you are having.  Usually they are busy on the weekends. One time I had to wait 20 minutes to get a table. 20 minutes is not that long, because the servers are fast. And they are very friendly. I don't think they are rude at all. They don't have serious faces, unlike other Chinese Servers from other restaurants. They will smile and take your order. Yesterday I got out of class very late and I was very hungry. They close at 9:30 PM and I got there at 9:15 PM. I asked them if I should take to go, they told me to stay! By the time I finished, it was 9:50 PM. They did not give me any attitudes at all the whole time. Even though they told me to slow down and take my time. I was really appreciated.  Overall, I really like this restaurant, and I recommend you guys to go there. Like I said earlier, they have many different kind of Chinese food. You should invite your friends to go with you and order a combo, so that way you can try different favors. One of the best Chinese food restaurant in town! Worth to try it out.",

I asked if one is still able to bring in raw food from the market to be prepared here, and I was told yes- good to know!  Very friendly service, but I must admit I was there w/ friends related to the owners.    Clean atmosphere and very bright inside.  The tables are a bit too close to each other, I thought, but nothing that can't be adjusted if one asked the management, I'm sure.  On my next visit, I will have to remember to ask about omitting cornstarch as I did break out due to food allergies.  To those w/ MSG (monosodium glutamate) allergy, no worries here as the kitchen does not use it.    BTW, I couldn't find what I had cravings for (crispy Mongolian beef over noodles) on the menu, but after speaking w/ the matron of the house, Mrs. Leung, I was able to eat something close to it.  I did find the dish a little too salty, but it was still good.  I liked the crispiness of the noodles, as well; However, the leftover noodles didn't reheat well.  I suggest to eat your fill at the resto, or share w/ friends (which I did, but I still had some leftover)...    Hope to go back soon!",

    "text": "This is my single favorite Asian restaurant in Arizona at this point in time. I have been coming here for years and it is amazing how they can make such delicious food at the prices they do. They put all other asian restaurants to shame IMO.   But, the best part of this restaurant is that not only do you get great food. But, you can feed a family of 5 for 25 dollars. Here are some tips on how to get the most out of your ACE experience.  Here is how you ACE.  1. Invite your friends(The more people the cheaper the bill when split) 2. Order the family dinner for 3-4 people or special family dinner for 5-8 3. Substitute the white rice for egg-fried rice for a dollar more(That way you get a large portion of fried rice and a large portion of lo-mein to share. 4. Choose your entrees-Everything is good, so order what you like, but, their menu can be a little intimidating. Some recommendations I would give for first timers would be:  Orange Chicken Twice Cooked Pork Salt & Pepper Squid Mongolian Beef Yin & Yang Fried Rice Black Bean Squid Vegetable Curry-Feel Free to add meat of your choice Kung Pao Shrimp  5. Enjoy delicious food 6. Split the bill 7. Laugh at the fact that you just had some of the best asian food ever for a mere 5-7 dollars",

When we came to pick up the order, every table was full and there was a line of people waiting to pick up their food.    We ordered chicken fried rice, chicken lo mein, pork egg rolls, orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken.  You have the option of two different sizes of each item wen ordering.  The small sizes are plenty big and we had so much leftover food.  The orange chicken and sweet and sour chicken were both really crispy and the lo mein was loaded with chicken and veggies.  I wish they delivered, but since they don't, I guess I will have to brave the crowds because it's the best Asian food I've had in a very long time.",

This is as authentic as you can get without all the frills of ambience.  EXCELLENT food!!!!   The wait time usually takes awhile, especially if you go for a late dinner (after 7pm).  It gets so busy that the waitresses are running and don't have enough time to bus their own tables. So often you will find lots of dishes piled up on one table or you have to sit and wait for the table to be bussed.  BUT, if you can live with all of that, you will find THE BEST CHINESE food that is WORTH THE WAIT, and WORTH THE CHAOS.   The menu goes on forever.... With so much to choose from, you will be happy for the wait - just so you can get through the menu!  One more thing - if you catch your own fish, or buy it from the Asian Market across the street, bring it in and they will cook it for you!!  I highly recommend the Salt and Pepper Squid (or S&P Chicken too) as an appetizer.  It's pretty salty but OH SO GOOD!!  So many good things to try here!!",

The staff was friendly and got our order in fairly quickly. Then when we opened the menu, all 3 of our mouths dropped when we saw how cheap each of the items were. We were already loving it! We ordered the Chili salt chicken wings, dumplings, salt and pepper fried squid, and orange chicken with fried rice. I honestly cannot tell you one bite I did not enjoy. I usually run into problems with this style of food because, let's just say I really enjoy salty food. And usually food associated with this type is really sweet. I was so happy to taste how flavorful each bite was!!! Again, raving about this place to all family members and friends.  Definitely will be back :)",

Stopped at this restaurant - the food is terrific!  We had a stir-fried spicy eggplant rice and the Singaporean noodles.  The \"wok-air\", interpreted as the temperature and the strength of the gas cooking, made the food taste fresh and crisp.  We came from Hong Kong and later stayed at Seattle, so we are picky about Chinese food, and I gave this place a 4 stars!  Interesting side story - the chef was talking in Cantonese with one of the local patron.  He said he's only cooking with olive oil and how healthy it is compared to vegetable oil.  Thought it's worthy to mention for those who are worried about bad greasy Chinese food - this place isn't one of those.",

The waitresses are some of the nicest people you will ever meet and know me and what kinda of food I like and keep in mind to my family's food allergies. The food is authentic Hong Kong Style cooking as you are going to get in Arizona. They have a wide selection of dishes that has something for everyone!      I must say, this place needs a bit of an update with the interior or maybe just even a bigger restaurant. They have such a huge fan base that I think they would benefit from increasing the inside or reorganizing the inside of the restaurant to seat more people. There have been times where I have waited quite a while to even get seated because they were just so busy! Which I would recommend either eating somewhere else for the night or come back in a few hours so that you do not have to wait so long. They get very busy around dinner time on the weekends, I recommend for the best experience, to go for lunch during the week because there are very few people during that time. Other than the wait time, this place is absolutely amazing! I highly recommend giving this place a try!",

I will be back to try other foods - that night was just poor judgement on my part with my food choice! Love places with good customer service!",

ACE is very humble and casual which is what I prefer. The massive menu was a red flag but everything we tried there is great. We have been there 3 times but we ended up ordering the same 3 items every time because it was so good. I'm still not sure how they provide such great food with such large portions at such a low price point. Luckily, we need to drive a good 30min to get to ACE. If they were closer I would be 400lbs",

This place is a nice size restaurant, mostly Asian clientele, and you could tell they are satisfied regulars. I was referred here, came with 3 friends, and we were so impressed. The menu is so huge with food from many regions and Hong Kong. There was so much I wanted to try, I will be back regularly to do so. We had noodle dishes, egg rolls, soups, dumplings, Chicken and pork dishes, we ate enough for 3 meals. Everything was so great. The waitress spoke English but with a little difficulty. She was so cheerful, friendly, pleasant and came back when she could despite the huge crowd at 8 PM.  It was the best 20 minute trip I took since moving here.",

    "text": "ACE makes my favorite beef chow fun, EVER.  I've never had a dish I disliked here up until last night. Hawaiian BBQ beef! Wow, not what I expected at all. I was expecting grilled beef slices (think bulbogi) but what we got was sliced up meat (similiar to the look, consistency and taste of pot roast) covered with teriyaki sauce. Umm, for reals? Never would've I imagined. But that's what happens when you take someone who is not too familiar with Chinese food and you do the everyone choose one dish and we'll share route. It was so bad I had to comment, \"When you go to a Chinese place, order Chinese dishes.\" lol.  Anyway, no worries beef chow fun made everything better.  I've been here numerous times now and have enjoyed everything else I've had. Some of my favorites include:  -Beef with Scramble Egg sauce over rice. -Salt & Pepper Squid -Salt & Pepper Chicken Wings -Orange Chicken -Baked Pork Chop spaghetti -Mongolian Chicken -Fried Rice -Lo Mein  I haven't really ventured towards their more traditional chinese dishes but some day I finally will. I saw stir fry pickled chinese mustard that really intrigued me. It's one of my favorite homestyle dish. But I'll save that for a solo meal because it has an acquired taste.  Oh and their taro coconut tapioca drink is yummy. It reminds me of a taro dessert my mom would make. It's creamy, coconut milk with taro chunks, sweetened and with little clear tapioca pearls.   *Also, their menu stated that they will cook fresh raw seafood for you. You just have to bring in the receipt alongside. It's $5 each dish and you can choose from a long list of sauces/styles you would like to have it prepared. Very convienent with Mekong Market across the street. Yummm... I think I may have to return with a lobster to have them make me lobster with gravy over e fu noodles.",

Although sometimes the packaging can get messy they really try their best by double boxing it and putting a small plastic bag around those. A large item can easily turn into 3 full meals, and a regular into 2. The Mongolian chicken is a bit sweet but the fried rice is amazing and the white rice isn't sticky which is how I  prefer it. I would keep coming back if I could.",

We chose the fish fillet, orange chicken, Salt and pepper pork chops, pepper beef and short ribs in black bean sauce.   Each dish was excellent and actually seemed larger in quantity than before.   This restaurant is always packed with Asians which is a great sign meaning that the food is great, inexpensive and fast.  One of my other favorite dishes is the chicken curry but today I had to pass and wanted to try other items.   Will drive 25 miles in a heartbeat to dine here because of the quality and price.

I hope that you all have a better experience. This is my first negative experience there.  *Update. I received excellent service from a local burger joint.

I ordered the  fried squid with steamed white rice. The squid was deep fried and had a strong taste of the grease. It had so much grease; as soon as I took my first bite I had grease left all around me lips. I took 2 more bites and I was done. The steamed rice was so dry to the point that it had obviously been over cooked.   Since it was my lunch time time , I ordered it to go. Took 15 minutes to get this \"fried calamari\" and as soon as I got it I was on my way back to work. Wish I had the opportunity to take it back and replace it, but how could I ? I was already at work :(   Idk why the reviews are so high, I'm hoping is because no one only really orders the squid or I'm hoping is because people dine in instead of to go and they get better quality meals. Whatever the case might be, the quality should be served to anyone regardless if the meal is to dine-in or to-go.   I Lost around $10 but they Lost my interest.",

Since it is a hike from our home and we didn't know when/if we would be back, we tried a bunch of food (and will have leftovers for a million days). The menu was huge and somewhat strangely disorganized. Make sure to look all the way through so you don't miss out on the yummies in the back. We ordered:  Kung Pao Chicken/fried rice General Tso's chicken/brown rice Veggie Chow Fun (dry) Crab puff ($2 for 2 large poofs) Spicy chili chicken dumplings(4) 2 sodas  (all for $28!!)  The Kung Pao was tasty, spicy and the veggies cooked perfectly. The chicken was a good quality. The only negative was that the peanuts were placed on top after the dish was prepared. The general's chicken sauce had a kick and the crunch and taste of the breading was unique and yummy. The chicken meat wasn't all the greatest quality (a lot of dark meat, untrimmed gristle) but served its purpose. Bummer that no peppers or veggies come with General's as elsewhere.  I was offered either wet or dry chow fun and went with the recommended dry (stir fried in soy sauce). So glad that I got the veggie version. Perfectly cooked and the subtle sauce on the flat rice noodles was fabulous. The crab puffs(2) were clearly homemade, which we appreciated but they didn't have much flavor. No crab to be found and missing that slight sweetness that I enjoy in the puff elsewhere. Hubby enjoyed the dumplings (4) and saved the sauce for his dish (I didn't care for the sauce but the dumpling was cooked really well). They give you cans of soda (thus, no refills) and the food comes out super fast. This is usually appreciated but it came out at the same time as our appetizers, which didn't give us a chance to ease into our ginormous meal.   Due to the freshness and low cost of the food as well as wide variety of options, we would come back but try something different.",

After looking around for a while with our puzzled look and talking to the big group who was waiting before us, we ended up seating ourselves! About 3-4 min later the waitress looked at us asking how many we were and she got us the menu. A min later another waitress served us water. They gave us some time to look at the menu and waitress returned to take our order in a few min. We ordered the family (3 main course) meal which includes any 3 entrees you want, white or brown steamed rice and noodles, and to our surprise, for only $25.5! We thought the dishes must be small but to our surprise, all dishes were almost platter size! Wow, what a good deal we thought. We ordered Kung Pao Chicken, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Beef with Broccoli and white rice. we also ordered an appetizer of spring rolls which was only $1.99 for 2 pieces, not bad. Our favorite of all dishes was the sweet and sour chicken, a 5 star dish in our opinion. It was crispy and the sauce was coating it perfectly, non of this really reddish pink sauce I don't like. We basically loved it! The rest was to us very good. We enjoyed the food and for this amount of money, this was a great experience. We saw everyone leave with boxes, and so did we. They actually pack them for you on the table, very nice.  The reason why I had to give it 4 stars rather than 5 is because only one dish was 5* quality to us really. We will be going back for sure and will definitely order the sweet and sour chicken again. A very good find we believe!",

Old school Chinese food that blows away any of the popular grab and go chain restaurants, and defiantly more affordable.",

If you come in before 7pm it's the best time because it's not super busy, food doesn't take long but unfortunately the service does. But it is not the servers fault it is because they're short staffed and the place gets so packed that there is a line at night. I give food and service 5 stars but I give 4 stars to management. You guys should really hire more people to help out at night instead of having two people take care of a packed restaurant, poor girls are even checking people out and are running around like crazu. I come here all the time before 7  pm and it's amazing, highly recommend the beef lo main!",

Their menu is huge so we can always order something different. Their crab puffs are the best and the Chili Sauce Dumpling are absolutely delicious. Our other favorite appetizers are the fried shrimp, chili salt chicken wings, and chili salt spare ribs. You won't be disappointed!  I think my favorite entrees would be their orange chicken (of course!), but there general chicken is also really good if you like spicy. We don't order their beef dishes much, but their seafood dishes are pretty good. I would recommend the shrimp in lobster sauce. I think all of their fried rice is good.  The most important thing about Asian Cafe Express is that they are affordable for lunch or dinner. Their lunch bowls only run about $4.15 without tax, appetizers are between $2-$5, and entrees are no more than $8. They even offer dinner specials if you want to order multiple entrees!  Oh, they also have boba milk tea... Yum!",

As is our normal routine, when I am not invited; I act as the chauffeur service and drop her off  on campus, and make myself scarce.  Since I already know how long these symposiums go, and she would be famished by the time it was done, I figured I would stop by one of my favorite Chinese restaurants in the area and order enough food for the both of us for the next two days.  Hence, I stopped by my friends at ACE. Li stopped to say hi, and asked where my wife was. I told her that she was at school, and I am ordering for the both of us. Some for me to consume here, and the rest would be for takeout.  I ordered the Salted Pork Chop, House Fried Rice, Minced Garlic Choi Sum, Chicken Curry, and House Special Pan Friend Chicken Lo Mein. I sampled a few of them, and had them pack up the rest.  As always, this place is authentic, unassuming, and simply delicious. They never fail to impress me. And the service? Well, I come to this place because they know me by name, and they are always glad that I came! (cue Cheers theme song)",

The food is inexpensive and they offer so many different options for singles, couples, and groups. It is small and you seat yourself. The food is delicious and I have to rave about their homemade wontons! They are stuffed with pork and shrimp and they are very fresh tasting! It was pretty busy for a Monday night, so I am guessing the restaurant has a lot of fans!   My one complaint is that the waitress originally spoke English to me and Chinese to my friend, but after a few minutes she quit speaking to me entirely and would only ask my friend what I wanted to eat or if she should ask me certain things. Definitely a little uncomfortable since I could have answered for myself, but I got over it.",

I came here years ago, forgot about it, and assumed they were no longer there. Have had a hard time finding good Chinese food in the valley. Drove around looking for one last night, and found this one again. LUCKY ME!!  It was early in the evening, so we didn't expect the crowd we found when we walked in. This place was packed!  Fortunately, the three waitresses, that were serving the entire place (!) were amazing. And whoever was cooking in the back? Must have had a magic wand....  The food came out super fast. That was a good thing, because I was hungry enough to eat the arm of the person next to me. That was also a good thing, because the portions were HUGE. And the prices were fantastic! We had Mongolian beef, sweet and sour pork, Kung pao shrimp, and sweet and sour soup. Three starving people ate until we were almost bursting, and took home enough for another meal for all three of us.  I couldn't recommend this place more. Bring all your friends! Wait! Don't! Let's keep this place just our secret for now. Love this place , wish I could give 10 stars.",

I've been here several times and tried several of their dishes like their fried rice, black pepper chicken which is really flavorful. I recently tried their bean drink which I was amazed at how good it was. (I am adventurous with food, so this drink may not be of everyone's liking)",

    "text": "I had my first visit to ACE yesterday (1:30 pm'ish) and here are my thoughts. The ladies which run it are extremely nice and quite efficient.  The egg rolls and the dipping sauce didn't have much flavor, but we're still decent.  The Kung Pao Shrimp with peanuts on top was phenomenal. Lots of veggies, plenty of sauce, and a good amount of shrimp.   The salt and pepper fried squid had an unusual smell to it. I am not sure if it was old oil, or just the seasoning they use. For the amount you receive (tons) the price is extremely fair. I was torn on this one because it kept pulling me back in for more, but still had an unusual smell to it.  The orange chicken was lightly breaded and had a mild flavor to it. Not much sauce on it. Average for orange chicken as it goes. I still think Lotus Garden in Apache Junction is the best for orange chicken.  The rice was on the clumpy and very slightly dry side. Not so far that it couldn't be salvaged with a little sauce. Not sticky and clumpy, dry and clumpy. Unusual considering I rarely ever come across that in a Chinese restaurant. Even more so considering how busy this place is and the turnover on rice should be super fast.  The seating is, anywhere you choose to sit. They have a good amount of tables. They have pictures on the wall of all of their dishes. Not stock pictures, but of the actual dish They made. They have a self serve condiments area you can use to get any extra you may want without the need to wait until someone is available to ask for it. I do like this because if I am in a hurry I like to get things myself.  I tried the taro coconut tapioca drink. It was perfectly sweet. If you do not like pulp type items (or tapioca beads) in your drinks you will not like this at all. I don't mind it at all. The straw was extra wide and was easily able to accommodate the pulp and beads in the drink.  All in all I still give it 4 stars. I know that the variety of dishes they offer is awesome. I am eager to try some I haven't come across before at Americanized Chinese restaurants. I will be back for sure.  Update: Having now tried 14 or so different dishes I have to revise down to a 3-1/2 stars. Great variety. But average in taste for most dishes.",

I must say, I am very happy with my meal. I've been searching for a place like this near my work for a long time and I believe I have found it. As I said, I've tried many different places and I'm usually disappointed, but from the first bite to the last, I am very pleased. I purchased the Mongolian Chicken and it is amazing. Very flavorful, a slight heat (not overwhelming as far as I'm concerned), but the flavor profile all comes together very well. I will definitely be adding them to my lunch rotation. I'm so excited that I finally found a place that I can trust to order from close by where I won't end up disappointed when I order something random from the menu.",

You really feel like you are in another country when you step inside. The place is very dated with pictures of the food covering the walls. Chopsticks in a cup on the table and hot chili oil in a squeeze bottle. The menu is one of, if not the largest Chinese menus I have ever had the pleasure of holding. This place cooks things I have never even heard of. If you have not been here you are actually doing yourself  a disservice.  The portions you get are gargantuan,  no other place in the whole city gives you that much food for the money. You will just have to come here to even comprehend that, and I'm serious. I have never once been able to finish my food. Food taste is extremely fresh and as far as I can tell, authentic. The baby bok choy alone is worth coming for, and it's in a lot of dishes. If you like Chinese food, this needs to be on the very top of your list. Very highly reccomeded. I will be coming here for many years and thank the lord I found it.",

Is where I ate some rice (Asian Cafe Express!) I could not get enough (Asian Cafe Express!) Don't forgot about my spice! (Asian Cafe Express!) I had to Yelp away..........  Cheap good Chinese style cuisine from all parts of the China!  Sha-wha!? No it's Shu Mai stupid!  Anyways, came here with 6 friends and we were going to do it the hard way; everyone order something, but instead we saw the Family Style Dinners.  They had every region: Hong Kong, Northern, Szechuan, and even Spicy!  Not sure where the spicy region came from, but we decided against it this time around since one of my buddies is wimp when it comes to spice.  Along with the Family style comes with fried rice, white rice, and chow mein.  Our 5 sides we order were XO Beef, Mapo Tofu, Fried Tofu, Calamari, and the last dish was Chicken, but not sure what it was called!  My bad peeps!    Overall my favorite was the XO Beef and Calamari.  Just enough spice on the beef dish while the calamari was perfectly seasoned and breaded to a crunch munch!  Service was friendly and fast, but the place was definitely a dive!  In the end, the bill came to about $50 for 6 people, but we couldn't even finish -- Fail! - Enjoy!",

Note #1: The menu is very confusing, it's not organized very well. If you have a Mandarin or Cantonese speaking friend or family member, I'd suggest bringing them so they can order their favorite dishes.   Note #2: This is a Hong Kong style restaurant. So order Cantonese style dishes.  Here's what we got for $24 including tax and tip: Garlic or Schezuan Eggplant Seafood Pan Fried Noodles Mongolian Beef  The eggplant was good, but way too much chili oil was added. There was a puddle of oil on the bottom of the dish.  The seafood crispy noodles - eh, I've definitely had better, and I was disappointed that it wasn't outstanding because this is a signature Cantonese dish. Maybe the Beef Chow Fun would've been a better choice (another signature Cantonese dish).  The Mongolian beef - American dish, so it tasted pretty American, but nonetheless, it was tasty :)  Rice is complimentary I believe, and the waitresses were VERY attentive, they kept topping off our waters.",

The $4 \"Americanized\" bowls of Chinese food are a SMOKING good deal. I was astounded by that, and the fact that you can even bring your own seafood in and they will make it to your liking - Black Bean, Szechuan ect...  I just personally wasn't too too impressed by the food I got. I crave authentic/quality dishes, but I ended up with a pretty mediocre one. The Shrimp were super small, and they loaded me up with onions (I get it, hit em with a cheap ingredient in excess). But I don't appreciate paying 9-10 bucks for onions and small shrimp.  Another point off because they don't serve beer. I like a nice crisp Tsing Tao when I am enjoying Chinese food.  Overall - If you want authentic, and frigging delicious WITH beer and fresh seafood? China King (Alma and Ray) or Hong Kong Gourmet (Rural and Ray) are better options.   C+",

Did I mention $1 and eighty some odd cents gets you 2 chicken egg rolls that taste like it was dipped into the fryer a couple dozen times?!  For the same exact price, you can get 3 steamed or deep-fried chicken dumplings!  I hate to sound like a cheapskate but I am just the informant!  If you grow tired of those neighborhood Chinese buffets, come here for a change as you can easily spend less than $40 for 5 people on a family-style dinner set.  If you want to go a la carte, the highest item is $7.  Lunch specials run around $5-6 for a full plate of big portions!  If you cannot decide or just have trouble translating visually what is in the menu, simply gaze around the dining room as they have a set amount of food pictures to go along with text and pricing.  In fact, first time I ordered here was from the wall!  It was this Japanese BBQ Pork Chop over Rice + Egg!  Overall, I would say the menu offers the usual plus more unique, atypical items that is worth trying.  That particular aspect is my second reason why I enjoyed this place.  One caveat that seemed consistent with my experience was the length of wait for your order.  They are not the fastest but your appetite and wallet will walk out immensely satisfied.",

I do know that their stir fried fish with yellow chives was so delicious that we returned a week later to try the Hong Kong fish which we also loved.  After a small bowl of preserved veggie and pulled pork soup, one order of fish was perfect for two adults to share for lunch w/o leftovers.  We drove about 25 miles on each of two visits and will be back probably with friends in tow.  They will think we're nuts to drive so far but that's what we snowbirds like to do.    Across the street there is a huge Asian supermarket.  What a surprise!  Each aisle has ethnic specialities from a different country.  I wouldn't know how to prepare them even if I could read the labels but it's very interesting.  Who knew there were so many Asian people here in the desert?  A lot of them seem to like the Asian Cafe Express too.  It won't be long til our next visit to ACE, the place with the wonderful Hong Kong chef.",

Now that you know that I will tell you this is one of the best Chinese food meals I have ever had. We had just returned to Phoenix from a long vacation and we knew there was no food in the house. So I Yelped and we decided to visit Asian Cafe Express.   We all chose a meal but then decided to get the Family Meal. You can order 5 different entrees in addition to white rice, fried rice and lo mein. We ordered orange chicken, kung pao chicken, general chicken, sweet & sour chicken, and kung pao beef. I don't like deep fried or heavily breaded food so I didn't try those three but my kids were very happy.  The kung pao dishes were awesome, slightly spicy but I added more, tender chicken and beef and crunchy veggies, slightly sweet. The fried rice was so yummy - veggies and eggs.   We were starving and ate a lot and still brought home at least 6 boxes of food. We had it for dinner and a bit for lunch the next day.   The atmosphere is fine, not fancy, the mall has maybe one other business in it. The service was great. Definitely worth the drive for us.",

    "text": "This is the best take-out Chinese food in the East Valley. Great prices, enormous portions, reheats well--this place has the works.  My favorite dishes are the dry veggie Chow Fun and the Kung Pao. When I eat in, however, I usually don't go for these dishes. You see--there are two menus here, the AZ Menu and the Traditional Menu. The AZ menu is basically like every other take-out place, it has your General Tso's chicken, Mongolian, Kung Pao, Orange Chicken, etc. That stuff is great for take-out. The traditional menu is HUUUUUGGEEEE and CONFUSSSSSSINGGGG but once you figure it out, there is so much incredible stuff on there. The stuff I ordered off this menu wouldn't have done well as take-out, but I'm sure there is stuff that does well as take-out off this more traditional menu.  My suggestion is when you are craving Panda Express, remember Asian Cafe Express and order take-out from here instead off the AZ Menu (don't forget some Powerade). If you're trying to sit down and eat some good Chinese food, pick up a traditional menu, roll some dice and choose something that sounds even remotely appetizing. Then, enjoy. This menu is where the good stuff is at. Plus, the dining room is filled with Asian people so that has to be a good sign (seriously). There are pictures up on the wall if you need an idea of what things look like.",

Their service is pretty average, and their ambiance below average (like any authentic Chinese place...) Unfortunately, if a \"good\" Chinese place actually had nice interiors, I'd dock OFF a star for the lack of authenticity, haha...  I came here the first time for their porridge/congee, since not too many Chinese places offer the dish, and it's one of my faves. Pretty much everything I've ever gotten here was really tasty, and we've been back a good number of times.  I always recommend this as a great local eatery.",

    "text": "Asian Cafe Express gets five stars because it is the ONLY take out Asian food I ever get.  I've tried other places, and nothing compares, so when you find something this awesome and affordable with the best twice cooked pork in the world, you don't stray.   I keep an Asian Cafe Express menu in my kitchen drawer and I mark each thing I've tried with a smiley face, a sad face, or one of those faces that just have a line for a mouth (those ones represent \"okay\").  May I note though, that nothing is bad, it's all about personal preference, the stuff that got a sad face was never because it was bad, it was just because it wasn't really my bag.  The twice cooked pork is arguably the best thing in the world.  I would put this twice cooked pork up against five star restaurants, that asshole with those cooking shows on Fox, or maybe even some Eastern religion's God.  I get it every time I go there and when I leave this city I will travel great distances to have it again.   Also worth traveling for is the General Chicken w/ Sweet and Chili Sauce, this has just the right about of sweet and spice with nice, well cooked, perfectly prepared chicken stuffed in one of those awesome Asian take out food boxes.  In fact, all of the chicken dishes are pretty good, that goes for the fried rice too, ESPECIALLY the pork fried rice which I would shower in if I could.   I've tried most of the appetizers as well and my favorites are the Chili Sauce Dumplings and the spring rolls.  There's nothing fancy about them, they're just always the perfect companion to your meal.  The only complaint I ever had was with the Chili Salt Chicken Wings which, while still better than a lot of gross shit I've had, were SOOO salty I could hardly eat them.   Also notable the Lo Mein, the totally affordable and always delicious Family Dinner Pack in which you get an obscene amount of food for 20 bucks, the adorable and prompt staff, the way they give you large orders in boxes so it's easier to carry, the seeded Chili sauce they provide on all the tables, the consistency of it, and also the twice cooked pork.   I'd probably dine in a lot more if they served beer or liquor but that's not their fault, that's my Grandma's fault cause she is an alcoholic and my Mom says it's genetic.",

    "text": "Just got back from eating at Asian Cafe Express.  I went there strictly based on Yelp reviews.  Here is my assessment: Portions=5 stars Pricing=5 stars Service/friendliness=4 stars Food taste= 2 Based on the above, they deserve 4 stars all things being equal. But things are NOT equal.  The taste of the food is what should drive the rating of a restaurant assuming that they don't throw the food at you or spit in your soup.  Other than that , it is taste, taste ,taste.   I was not impressed with the taste of the food.  I have been to NYC Chinatown restaurants, San Francisco's Chinatown, LA's Chinatown, even Paris' Chinatown so I know what good chinese food is.  This is not it.   People's judgement gets clouded by a low price and then suddenly everything tastes great.  You will note that most of the reviews make reference to their low prices and maybe that's why that have all those Best of Phoenix ratings.  People rate restaurants not only on taste but overwhelmingly based upon getting a good bang for the dollar.  This is a case where the bang for the buck reigned supreme.  AND... by the way, they said their toilets were not working.  Isn't it illegal to operate a restaurant without have toilets working properly considering that the restaurant has a capacity of at least 90 people?  Where does the staff go pi-pi?  Just asking....  Anyway,  Food is rated a two and this geeser isn't spending gas to save a few nickels on food.  I would rather pay more for half the portion and feel that I have had a DELICIOUS and DELECTABLE meal.  My husband on the other hand................",

    "text": "My boyfriend was the person who took me to this place because he dubbed it as the best hole in the wall for chinese food. lol  This is one of the places that he loves to go to where the food is really good   ***  Now I have been here a few times and I want to be honest to those who are seeking a really good place to eat good chinese food.  Don't expect to imagine this place as a fancy restaurant or any place that is spic and span with cleanliness on top - because it's NOT that type of place. However, it is a hole in the wall place where you can enjoy your food and look beyond the appearance of this tiny eatery.  Looks can be deceiving so think of that before you decide to eat here.  The wait time to be seated is always going to take more than 20minutes because this place is popular it will always be BUSY and when I mean busy I mean you walk through that door and people will stare at you for a bit then resume eating. There will be tables that are not cleaned and few of the workers there will be sparse due to trying to maintain and do their job  There will be a long or short line consisting of  people eating for two to a party of 4-6 standing in line to eat OR doing a take out.  If you can not be patient and wait, then I recommend you go eat somewhere else.  The same applies if you are ordering there for a to go. If you are calling to place an order to go - good luck because the workers do not speak clear english just to warn you again.  If you are seated, you will need to have patience to wait for more than 15 minutes until someone can come over to take your order. If you feel offended that most of the customers are chinese and are served first before you - don't take it to heart. That is just the way of things and again you are here to enjoy yourself and the food.  If you have kids, I would go look elsewhere because the wait will be long and majority of kids will start to fidget and want food due to being very hungry. If you are patient and if your kids are patient enough then it is worth eating there.  These are all the factors that I have noticed when I come here with my boyfriend. There is nothing that can be done about it except for being patient and waiting for the food to arrive. For me, it is worth eating there unless we decided to do a take out and relax at home with our food.  Again, I express if you really want to eat here you must have an understanding and be patient :)  I do suggest this place if you meet what I wrote above because the food is worth it :)",

    "text": "Today I was having an Asian withdrawal as it had been quite a while since I last ate Asian cuisine.  I was in Apache Junction and did a Yelp search.  I could not find a place so looked in Mesa and Asian Cafe came up on top.  Being hungry I said this is it.  Was I disappointed for driving so far?  Not one bit.  The menu plunked down in front of me was like a telephone book...thick with many pages.  A quick flip through the pages told me what I needed to know.  The tough part was to not order the old standby....Kung Pao Chicken.  No, today I decided to order the more difficult dish to make; the Mongolian Beef with egg fried brown rice.  The Mongolian Beef was perfect in every way.  Every morsel of meat was tasty and most important tender and this is the hardest part for most Asian places.  The brown sauce had just the perfect level of heat that was consistent throughout the entire dish.  Also the right amount of onions as well.  I did not want to stop eating and I ordered the regular dish which was enough for 2 people.  I can't imagine what the Large dish would be like.  The egg fried brown rice was perfectly done and again the best fried rice I've had in quite a while.  A no time during this meal did I feel any need to add more heat.  I also had the \"Regular\" Hot Sour Soup.  This is one dish I have the hardest time finding to be perfect my way.  I don't want it watery but just the right thickness and it was.  I want spring onions and most don't have it.  This one not only has the spring onion but a regular onion as well.  Since I could not eat all of the food presented I took it home and had it today for lunch.  It was every bit just as good as it was in the restaurant and that is also a first as most Asian dishes loose a lot when reheated.  The last interesting note to make is.....there was no fortune cookie with the tab.  This was also a first and I believe that is because the Asian Cafe Express is a True Hong Kong style restaurant where I don't remember getting a fortune cookie.  Would I go back?  In a hearbeat.  This will be my go-to place for Asian food as the menu is extensive.  A place for \"good eats\".",

Had the Kung Pao Chicken, Mongolian Beef, Sweet and Sour Chicken, Fried Rice and Lo Mein with Hong Kong Coffee and Milk Tea to drink. Everything was very tasty but I would say the sweet and sour chicken was the weakest dish as the sauce was warm and made the breaded fried chicken a bit mushy.  We ordered from the Arizona style menu (Americanized Chinese food) but they have an authentic Hong Kong style menu with all the things I seen in the cafe's in Hong Kong and China while visiting there. Very authentic feeling place and 95% of the customers were asian.  Will definitely eat here again.",
