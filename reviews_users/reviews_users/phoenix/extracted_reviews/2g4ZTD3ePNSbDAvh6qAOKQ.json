I have ordered for myself the cubano torta which is the best torta I've ever had; it is so flavorful with a slow heat from the jalepenos, but the cheese and avacados pleasantly calm the spicy flavors all encompassed in a bread that holds the sandwich together. The pork is not salty and I don't have the heart to try any other sandwich! Several colleagues have ordered the quesadillos, del ray torta (holy giant sandwich) as well as the platillos and I've yet to hear a bad comment. The mango agua frescas are also exceptional, so refreshing! After I move from Phoenix, this will be all I remember from here!! Must try and reasonably priced!",

We did have one issue - last time we went here I'd ordered a steak quesadilla, and it came with beans on it.  So this time when we ordered a steak quesadilla we explicitly requested no beans on it.  This was for a 'to go' order and the person who took the order over the phone assured us there were no beans on the steak quesadilla but made note of it anyway.  when we got home..there were beans on the steak quesadilla.  My daughter and I cannot stand the texture of beans, so that made the steak quesadilla inedible for anyone in my family.  I called to talk to the manager, but it was during dinner rush and he was unable to come to the phone.. so I sent a message via their email contact.    as I said, fortunately the tortas as easily big enough to feed a few people each, so we split tortas and everyone was full...    but why beans on a steak quesadilla?",

But what else would you expect from Los Reyes de la Torta? What you might not know is that their non-torta items are at least as good. Whatever the cheese they use (a white cheese, cotija maybe?) is delicious, not like the cheese used typically at the more Americanized places (which are also good, not trying to knock those). And the aguas frescas are very tasty as well; it's like drinking fruit! This place lives up to the hype so go check it out, but be prepared to wait because it's usually busy even during the week.",

I got the carne asade burrito instead. Which actually means bean burrito with a few tiny pieces carne asade mixed in. That was really annoying. The beans did taste good though.

They are not made from powdered mixes - they cut up the fruit right there and blend it with water, sugar and ice. I love the agua de sandia (watermelon), melon (canteloupe) and mango.  The drinks taste just like the fruit. Just beware, they are big and you can get full just from drinking them while you are waiting for your food.  You can ask for your drink to come in a to-go cup if you want to take it with you even if you eat there.   The food is great! I love the tortas, quesadillas and tacos. I haven't found anywhere else that comes close to the taste and selection yet.   You can call ahead and then pickup your order also.  I love salsa and bachata music and they often play this in the restaurant. They sell tickets to local cumbia concerts sometimes too. This is a great place!  Note: They were formerly called Tortas La Presa. I had gone to some of the other Torta La Presa locations and did not find the same food or drink selection and didn't know why. When I visited the 7th St location we asked and were told that due to a issue with the name and other places using the same name but being different, they had to change it.",

We order drinks with every dinner so no alcohol is kind of a big deal. Other than that we ordered and split the del ray then ordered a quesadilla to go. The Del Ray was fantastic and the Bistec quesadilla was the best quesadilla I've ever had. I would definitely go back for the food.... but come on guys...lets get a liquor license!",

Obviously I ordered the Torta Del Rey and split it with a friend and I was literally still blown away by the size. So many meats and proteins but there is still some a balance that makes this the king of the tortas.   However, I only gave this place 4 stars because Tortas are the only thing they do well (which is a little unfair). The huaraches and the different juices were only marginal and not worth ordering again. Stick to the Tortas and you will not be disappointed.",

My family got there before noon on a Sunday and we did not wait long.  On our way out there was a big crowd waiting so we were fortunate enough to have been seated in less than 10 minutes.  I have seen good reviews on their Aguas Frescas so we decided to try the Lime and Cantaloupe.  Both were very good and very refreshing, the lime reminded me of a lemonade slush.  We had the Queso Fundido with chorizo for appetizer, it came with chips, flour tortilla and pico de gallo and it was delicious.  The queso had the right amount of chorizo, a little greasy but that is expected from chorizo.  We ordered the Del Rey and Milanesa de pollo torta. The sandwiches were huge so half order per person was the perfect portion for us. The Milanesa de pollo was just ok but the Del Rey I really liked.  Avocado, chorizo, breaded beef, pork, ham, hot dog, omelet, refried beans and cheese all in a sandwich.  It was very tasty and there were so many different flavors going on.  It was great meal overall!",

    "text": "I recently visited Los Reyes de la Torta.  This was my second visit, which was definitely disappointing compared to the first.  The aguas here are DELISH!! They make a great summer drink, especially in this AZ heat.  I had the agua de sandia (watermelon), and my boyfriend tried the agua de fresa (strawberry) cremosa.  For the cremosa drinks they mix it with Carnation and sweet cream, and I have to say this is one of the thickest ones I've had before.  We ordered the queso fundido with jalapenos which I was really looking forward to.  However, this was a huge disappointment.  The waitress placed the plate down and I noticed that they served it with tortillas rather than tortilla chips.  I grabbed a piece of the tortilla, and went to scoop up some gooey queso fundido...except it wasn't gooey.  It was a gelatinous, almost solid bowl of cheese.  This didn't seem right to me.  We asked the waitress to warm it up some more, but it came back the same.  After asking her about it, she said they don't serve your traditional queso fundido.  They use mozzarella cheese which doesn't really melt to well...For dinner I had an order of the coctel de camaron (shrimp cocktail).  They are very generous with the shrimp.  Actually that's all that was really in there.  I would have preferred a little more avocado and  to have some cucumber in there was well.  I wouldn't mind giving this place another shot, especially for their awesome aguas.",

Not only did it take over 10 minutes to have our order taken, but then all of our drinks were wrong and they kept bringing extra drinks we never ordered.  Hoping this was a 'drink station mistake', we anxiously waited for our tortas. The would bring one torta at a time, which made it awkward for our large party, and every single sandwich was dry and lacking flavor. The drive through the sketchy area of town to get there, coupled with the subpar/overpriced food makes me not want to visit this place again. Steer clear!",

My only problem is that their closest location to me is 20 minutes from my house; I wish they'd open one closer.  I need them to open one near Tatum and Thunderbird; it would be a raving success.  I've had many of their sandwiches (Tortas), plates (Platillos) and Quesadillas.  I've never had one bad meal.  My friends frequently order their Burros, although I've yet to try them because there's so many other things I want to try.  Perhaps my favorite time to go is for breakfast.  All their breakfast items are excellent but my favorite is their Huevos Rancheros, which is not like any Huevos I've ever had.  It gets very busy around lunch time so I try as best I can to avoid going there from noon until 1:00 pm because there is always a wait.    Their service is wonderful.  Even when they are busy the food comes out fast.  There servers are always rushing around but they take care of the customers and this place is like a well-oiled machine.  Adam Richman (\"Man vs. Food\") did a segment on his TV show here several years ago.  If you haven't seen it, go to their website and it is available to view.

Can't remember what the GF had (some torta - which is unlike her) and I had the pork belly street tacos. In addition to the Valentina's sauce on the table, there was some other one made with chiltepin peppers. EXCELLENT and actually non-gringoized.   I'll admit, I didn't finish the 3rd pork belly taco. It just wasn't crisp enough for me (the meat not the shell), but it was tender. The texture just wasn't suiting me at that moment in time. I think the contrast of the crispness and citrusy flavors of the ceviche was just too much for me to take in on that day. Sometimes you like black and white, other times, you want muted pastels, ya know what I mean? I'm pretty sure it wasn't their fault - so my song remains the same 5 stars.   This place rocks. Staff is fantastic, food is good, and I was intro'ed to a new bottled hot sauce...which I don't remember the name of but theres a pic of it on GF's phone. I'll add it later.  P.s. As many ppl have noted, the tortas are a bit on the large side. They offer mini versions of most (if not all). That's the way to go if you order apps or just aren't into eating a pound of meat..",

    "text": "Los Reyes de la Torta (LRdlT) was my family's 3rd stop in our quest to try Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and Man vs Food restaurants in the Phoenix/Scottsdale, AZ area.  My family loved the DDD restaurants we experienced and LRdlT was going to be our one and only M vs F restaurant to try.  If there are any other Yelpers looking for a M vs F restaurant to eat at in Phoenix, LRdlT must be your 1st stop.  LRdlT is located in a mini strip mall.  At first glance, you probably would question how one of the best sandwiches could be cooked here because the restaurant looked simple and unassuming.  Highly recommend that you arrive around 5pm to beat the dinner rush.  The restaurant is not too big and the secret is out about how great the food is at LRdlT.  If you come after 6pm, expect to wait and you'll be jealous watching the lucky people eat some delicious, mouth-watering authentic Mexican food.  How do you gauge whether a Mexican restaurant has legit food?  Mexicans frequent the restaurant.  As we were eating, the waiting area filled up with Mexican brothers and sisters from another mother.  A Mexican torta is a sandwich with such Mexican meats as carne asada, pollo asada, carnitas, etc.  Adam Richman of Man vs Food fame introduced me to the Del Rey and the King Carlos V tortas.  If you want to accept the food challenge Adam performed on the show, you'll have to eat the humongous King Carlos in 15 minutes.  If you're successful, you won't have to pay the $25 for the sandwich.  No thanks, the Del Rey was more than enough for my overstuffed belly.  If you want a filling and very tasteful samwich, the Del Rey will make you thank Adam Richman out loud.  The Del Rey is comprised of ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, hotdog meat, chorizo, omelette, tomato, onions, avocado, and chipotle sauce, all squeezed between soft, nicely toasted bread.  This conglomeration of meat, milk, bread, and vegetables will satisfy all food groups and your daily caloric intake in just one sitting.  To be honest, I probably could have finished the entire sandwich, but I split it with the wifey to save room for our other food excursions while on vacation.  You honestly can't fathom how amazing this torta is until you experience it yourself.  Ask for the grilled onions and jalapenos, which complement the torta.  To help the food go down, a must order is the watermelon agua fresca.  This will satisfy your thirst.  Why oh why do my best food ever reside in places other than San Diego.  Adam Richman, you got it right recommending Los Reyes de la Torta.  The Del Rey was so worth sacrificing my slim waistline.  Until we meet again Del Rey, I'll be dreaming of how much I enjoyed engulfing you.",

I was only able to consume half the sandwich, you can surely bring a friend to split the meal. I would definitely go back and order this again. They also give you a red and green salsa. The red one is great cuz its got some heat after you keep eating some. Their ceviche is wonderful too!  I also had their flan, but I wasn't a big fan of it. I make my own and mine is creamy and sweet. Theirs is...the opposite.  Our order of water took awhile. The one in the group that ordered Coke got their drink first, probably cuz they paid for their drink...joking. But I ended up requesting to get our waters then they brought it.  Overall, it was a great experience and I definitely need to stop for the Del Rey Torta again and bring some friends.",

I had my torta around 1 pm, it's 10 pm now, and I am not even close to hungry,   This is the place you may have seen in the Food Netowork's \"Man vs. Food.\" I didn't get the monstrosity of a torta featured on the show but instead opted for the El Rey, the first one on the menu.   Whoah. This thing was HUGE. And stuffed with every imaginable sort of deliciousness, from breaded beef,  sausages and ham to fried egg, cheese, avocado and a delectable spicy chipotle mayo sauce.   The perfect lunch for a 110-degree August day in Phoenix. OK, not really-- I felt like I was going to faint a couple of times. But I soldiered on, and was able to (almost) finish the whole thing with the help of copious amounts of ice water.   Oh, it's also worth mentioning that whoever owns this place does not hire anything but the cutest Hispanic girls, all with their hair tied up in perky pony tails.   And like most other cheap eateries in Phoenix, you can make it out the door for under 10 bucks and stuffed fuller than a Tokyo subway train.   Can't wait to get back to the \"Torta Kings!\"",

Most boba places I frequent use powdered papaya flavor, but with this I could actually taste/ feel the bits of fresh papaya they used. I haven't had a good papaya drink in years and this is definitely one of the best ones I've ever had. They also have an extensive menu with items like burros, tacos and ceviche.

I was set on ordering the \" Mexican Shrimp cocktail \" since I had been craving one for a very long time & figured it would be outstanding since this place was featured on Man vs Food. ( I moved here a few years ago so I don't know the hot spots for this item )  I have had MANY mexican shrimp cocktails in my life that were amazing so I didn't even think twice when ordering since its a very easy thing to prepare in comparison with typical Mexican dishes..  Unfortunately I was very disappointed when it arrived. .. its like the cook forgot to put half the amount of shrimp in it!!! It probably had 7 - 8 shrimp in it with barely any avocado either. .it was mostly juice and Pico de Gallo.. ( I ordered the large on too! @ $14+ !!! ) ..VERY SKIMPY!!! I'm not expecting to be over served but I definitely expect a fair amount of shrimp! Out of many many places ive tried this was by far the chinsiest!   The flavor was pretty okay though. .not amazing whatsoever but not bad..It was a very sad night for me since I was really looking forward to finding a place that had great ones.. :(  I highly recommend that people beware of wasting your money on this dish. . On the other hand. ..my husband ordered a combo plate with carne asada tacos , beans and rice and I tried his food and it was delish!   I may give this place another try but definitely not the Mexican shrimp cocktail!!!! I'm on a mission to find a place that knows how to make them the right way and is not chinsey with their portion.  Also....its a restaurant atmosphere,  you are seated and have a waitress,  but NO Chips and salsa brought out to the table :( Definitely another downfall!  I'll go to Arriba's Mexican restaurant or Garcia's when I want great Mexican food! .. the price range is same and you get fresh hot chips with yummy salsa too!",

I got by fix to-go so I don't know about the dine-in experience, although while I was waiting the air got a little thick from the cooking.  I tried the Hawaiian torta, the pambazo and the milanesa (breaded steak).  The Hawaiian was pretty good although the pork element was a little overwhelming. A little off from the Mexican pierna.  The pambazo was too moist and the \"papas con chorizo\" got lost in the other (mediocre) flavors. I would like a kick of chorizo flavor with cubed potatoes, less salsa in the bun, and less lettuce. This was disappointing for me.  The best part, the milanesa torta. It, on its own gets the 4 stars for this place. Tasteful, nice portion (could feed 2 or 3), ripe avocado, jalapenos, nothing not to love of this torta.  It's good to have something from the Mexican kitchen that it's not tacos!",

The service was great, the price was really good, my meal came out fast, delicious and hot.  The torta was stuffed with all my favorite things and came with two different kinds of sauce and a bunch of ruffles potato chips.  I was pleasantly surprised by this place and would recommend Los Reyes de la Torta if you're looking for a creative, huge meal at a low price.",

It took ten minutes to park at the other end of the trashed out strip mall it's located in, and I seriously felt like I might be robbed by the locals I had to walk through to get to the place. It was packed when I walked in, and I asked if I could get a sandwich to go. The trashy looking hostess rolled her eyes at me and said they were filming right now and not making anything. There were a ton of people there for lunch, and people walked in behind me and were seated. The hostess smiled at me and said \"sor-ry\" in a sing songy rudeness I seriously couldn't even believe. I just looked at her, and left.  It's really sad how hostile the place was, and how rudely the staff behaved. So much for a great sandwich. I will stick to 13 north, where the service and food are good, and I don't have to wade through garbage to get there.",

Their signature, Del Rey, is a spectacular mountain of meat (hint: ask for extra chipotle sauce), super-delicious! I also tried the Princessa with chuleta (pork chop), and was pleasantly surprised - a close second! The ceviche tostada appetizer was very good. However, I was very disappointed in the enchiladas - rather dull and flavorless; I didn't finish, choosing to work on my delicious tortas instead. I had similar experience on my first visit with tacos and quesadilla. I suggest you stick with what they're known for = the tortas. These are awesome!!  Desserts are lackluster. Tried the tres leches again and it was fine. The choco-flan was boring, stopped after two bites.",

    "text": "We've been on an Asian cuisine kick lately and decided it was time to revisit Los Reyes.  It was 6:30pm by the time we arrived.  For a Saturday eve, it was fairly empty.  New menu with same items only slightly higher prices.  I ordered the Ranchera Torta with refried beans and hubby had Milanese de pollo with refried beans.  Both were good but I was not keen on the Mexican cheese.  It was not melted and very mild.  We both thought that the excellent taste was off that day.  I would go back to the Notena Torta as that has melted cheese.  We were somewhat disappointed but will try again in the future.  Another visit to Los Reyes.  It was later than our usual hour for eating and a bit more crowded. There were still three or four tables left. Hubby was hungry tonight and decided to splurge on the Del Rey Torta.  I stuck with my order of Nortena Torta.  Why ruin a good thing?  The Del Rey is huge.  Be hungry if you order this.  He finished half of the torta.  He was very satisfied with his hearty meal especially since he can have the other half later.  The Torta is so big it eventually falls apart.  Here is where the fork and knife come in handy.  The bread is slightly toasted and very soft.  Perfect for the Torta.  Staff are very nice  and efficient.  They recognize us by now.  Prices are good.  It seemed noisier than usual with the TV blasting and the crowd of people in the place.  No matter.  We still love it here.  We officially change our rating to 5 stars because the food is so consistently good.  There was more of a mixture in clientele tonight as well.  The word must have gotten out.  Parking is somewhat limited but there is a lot.",

I came here with a big group of people and we all got a variety of dishes which were delicious. The server recommended the del rey torta which i got and I have to say it's really good if you like tasty meated sandwiches. I got the mini size and it was still so big that I could barely finish. You get to choose a side of salad or potato chips with your meal. The size of the torta is huge and they really stuff up the meat so you will definitely be full when you finish the meal.   I also got the strawberry smoothie which comes in a fancy cup and it was good. One thing I wish they could change about the menu is add alcohol to the drink menu. Their drink menu is all non alcoholic and I can see the customers come in families so perhaps this is a family friendly restaurant. But I still if they serve alcohol, they will have a lot of business.  The price of all the dishes were super reasonable for the portion we get. The servers were nice and restaurant is huge with lots of tables. We came in an hour before it closed and stay passed the closing time and they did not complain or rush us. Overall, great place for authentic food!",

There's some amazing tex mex, but as far as authentic Mexican places and taquerias go, it's like you have to know a guy who knows a guy. It's not always easy to find a good one.  Searching for Mexican on Yelp while here from out of town, I see Los Reyes De La Torta is near the top of the list. One look at the menu prices and the photos of the Torta Del Rey, and me and the lady knew we had to check it out.  Of course we both got aguas frescas; I got the mango and she got the strawberry esquimos. Both were served in huge glasses with fresh fruit, hers was good enough she had to have a second.  I had to try the Torta Del Rey and see what all the fuss was about and it was worth it. It came packed with layer upon layer of delicious meat: some kind of breaded beef, pork, some scrambled eggs wrapped around hot dogs, cheese, avocado, and a bit of refried beans.. oh man. It was so good my lady stole half my plate! Not cool!   I got her back by munching on her peluche, essentially a mix of the meats inside the Torta Del rey, but sauteed with onions, peppers, jalapenos and pineapple. Delicious, but we both agreed not as good as the torta.   Altogether it was an extremely filling and tasty experience. There are really exciting and uniquely Mexican flavors in the food here, and Los Reyes De La Torta call themselves the kings for a reason. This place is special.",

WIth many choices and options, we chose the Los Reynas, and we have to say it was delicious......It was just a huge yummy sandwich that was flavorful.  The draw back was it just came with some chips.  Would have been nice with something a bit different, but still a great sandwich.    Bite after bite, this sandwich seemed like it never would end, but thats good so long as its flavorful.  And this surely was flavorful. The nice thing was thanks to yelpers we found this place so next time we are in PHX, definitely a place to stop by and try.",

We're from California and as soon as my husband knew we were coming the first thing he said was \"we have to go to TORTAS LOS REYES\" we've been here since Saturday, today is Monday we're going back home and before we go we had to visit and we weren't disappointed, we are definitely coming back whenever we visit Phoenix. Keep like this and I might move here (mmmmm no I don't think so) But yeah out visit was great I'll never forget the great service we got. Our friend is very picky with everything specially food and he said he's coming back at least twice a month, so this place is definitely great. Good job guys. I'm very proud of my people, we're very hard working people",

    "text": "It's been years since I've been, but last week I got the chance to revisit and I finally had to write a long overdue review.   First and foremost, while it used to be a literal hole in the wall, this place seems to have expanded in both directions to take up more space in the mini strip-mall that it's nestled within. There are larger dining areas now and much more seating room, but the rustic and very much authentic atmosphere has definitely been kept alive. You really do still feel like you've been transported to another place when you set foot inside, and you'd be forgiven for thinking you had stepped in off a street in Mexico city somewhere. There's Mexican music playing and Mexican TV on the flat screens as well. This place definitely scores bonus points for keeping the ambiance as genuine as possible.   To get started on the food, we took in a Mexican Quesadilla, which was terrific. Fresh and perfectly cooked, it was well worth the price and kept us addled while waiting for the main course, but without filing us up and taking away much needed stomach space for what was to come.   As far as the entrees, while the menu is diverse and while they offer all manner of deliciousness, the main draw here has always been the famed tortas. There's a plethora of choices on the menu, and we agonized over it for a while, but ultimately my dining companions and I settled on the Del Ray for last week's adventure, and we were not disappointed!   The Del Ray is made with delicious fresh bread, beef, ham, pork sirloin, onions and omelet, plus some cheese, re-fried beans and chipotle sauce, among other things, and, while it sounds crazy or over the top, the end result is fantastically and sinfully delicious. This bad boy is stacked so thick that it's almost (but not quite) impossible to wrap your mouth around it and take a bite. I ended up copping out and using a fork and knife to piecemeal it (no pun intended).   As you might expect, you really have to be hungry to finish one of these tortas in a single setting, which is probably why they offer a \"mini\" version of most of them as an option. But, seeing as how it's \"go big or go home\", we had all opted for the real thing, and were not left wanting for more. I did finish the whole thing, but I skipped most of my dinner later in that evening. There are no sides other than potato chips with the Del Ray, but it's not as if you would ever need or want for more food than what comes on the plate.   I'm really glad I had the chance to revisit this place after so long, and I finally took the plunge and had one of their famous tortas. It's a bit out of my way, but if I'm ever in the neighborhood and looking for authentic Mexican street food, I will gladly pop into this place again. Absolutely fantastic and not like anything else, certainly not mainstream Mexican restaurant fare. If you haven't been, you definitely have to give this place a try.",

    "text": "For the fun of spending the scorching Arizonian summer, the 4 of us carpooled to the Eastside for the casual \"Adam-Richman-was-Here\" experience.  His image on the front glass wall casted no doubts that this was the place where he had loyally bitten through this legendary Del Rey Torta ($9.50)--the primary purpose of our eating venture that we made 2 orders (1 per couple) of these behemoths.  Additionally, we were voracious & interested for the down-to-earth-looking Chilaquiles ($7) & Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99), plus their Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50) deemed critically appropriate during Phoenix's triple digit inferno.  Speaking of heat, that unrefined watermelon drink lovingly quenched our parched mouths &, particularly, the not-at-all watery & un-syrupy consistency convinced us that it was from a legit melon--just a pinch of sweet to enliven it a little more.  Meanwhile, the Chilaquiles--which (again) the arrangement of salsas & cheeses underneath the fried tortilla chips resembled the colors of the Mexican flag--proved very plentiful, &, from the SoCal's palate, turned out to be quite tasty, specifically their Cotija cheese & perfectly cooked eggs over easy.  The Shrimp Cocktail may look, well, soupy, but there was an adequate, lime-tastic amount of these medium-sized, decent crustaceans for DL, Kurdy, Angela & me to munch w/ the quirkily addicting fried tortilla.  At last, we attempted to dethrone the Del Rey Torta, flamboyantly composed of ham, melted cheese, breaded beef, refried beans, hot dog meat, chorizo omelet, tomato, onion, avocado & (finally) chipotle sauce.  Attempting to open at my widest, I managed to bite probably 3/4 of the stacked ingredients.  Obviously flavor-wise, altogether did equate into candid yummy-ness, & the overall textures were pleasantly soft, tender, & thankfully not unctuous.  However, if deconstructed (b/c we inadvertently let 1/2 of the torta spill on our plate), some individuals--like the beef & beans--were bluntly plain on their own.  In other words, they truly need to be eaten in unison for a king-like, gluttonous feel.  Plus, potato chips were served w/ these Sammies, but the reminiscence of plain old Ruffles left me only focused on the signature item.  Of course you're wondering if we finished the Rey; I believe I annihilated half of that stack.  We finally ended our eats w/ the surprisingly enormous Chocoflan ($4.50), which I honestly didn't care for & gladly permitted DL to finish the rest of it =P.  Service was certainly impressive even for the royals: very pleasant, accommodating, and attentive at their best.  It may be a 3.5-starred feast, but if I am in the mood for that fruit-tastic potion (which comes w/ other fruits & horchata) & a torta, I'd positively come back--this time begging for the traditional or their saucy version called the Pambasos.",

We ordered one to share and I still couldn't eat the whole thing.  The King Carlos V is the largest sandwich I've ever had, and the layer upon layers of food is endless.  There is breaded chicken, beef, ham, egg, cheese, avocado, tomato, lettuce, mexican sausage, mozzarella and it goes on and on.  It is served with chips and by cutting it into smaller bites, I was able to tackle some of it, but eventually, I had to abandon the bun and just pick apart the layers.  I finally surrendered and quite altogether.    The sandwich was really good, the different layers eaten together were good, however, it is just way too much.  There is a large menu with many other delicacies awaiting another visit.  Good service, very crowded, many locals!",

I went last week for the first time in about a year and I forgot how good it is. All I've had so far is the Torta Nortena (with the steak, not chicken) and the steak tacos. Both were incredible, especially the Torta Nortena, which has grilled steak, onion, jalapenos, melted cheese, chipotle, tomato, avocado, and chipotle mayo. It's huge and it's fucking awesome.   I haven't had a burrito here yet, but after seeing what the patrons at the next table had, it's on my to-do list. The burritos were about the size of my forearm and looked delicious. Los Reyes de la Torta may be famous for their King Torta seen on Man Vs Food, but to be honest I'd never get that one. It has way too many kinds of meat and it's total overkill. But hey that's me, maybe you'll like it. Eat this sandwich in under 15 minutes and it's free.

But it's a sandwich on a bolillo roll. Mmm but I can go and sit and not have to make it myself? And it's probably good right? I mean, it was on TV as its in Sunnyslope. So it's probably \"authentic\". And they serve aguas frescas? Si, quiero ir.   Donjay and I finally make it over after church one Sunday with Jon and Amy H along for the experience. Now in True Yelp fashion... I read the reviews and not just write them. And from the reviews I was wary of the infamous Del Rey torta. But.... We order it anyways.   This sandwich is like every meat a Mexican ever cooked piled high on a soft bolillo. The meats were all delicious, but together they made something of a strange flavor. They didn't mix well. The chorizo was really good. Almost overpowering the rest of the flavors. I found myself eating them piecemeal and not like a torta at all. Digging in with a fork and knife. Oh and side note, don't attempt to eat this on your own unless you are Sasquatch. Donjay and I split this monster and it STILL took me about 45 minutes  to an hour to eat it. I didn't finish my side of chips.   My horchata was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>.

To make things even more interesting Adam from man vs food was doing another episode on his show the day we showed up.  I was loving it.  It's kind of messed up how they moved all the regular customers to one side of the restaurant and filed on the other. Anyways, food was delicious and so fresh. They give you a lot of food for the money. We've been here twice and I promised my self anytime I'm in Arizona this is gonna be my first and last stop before I leave Phoenix.  It's a tiny restaurant so be prepared to wait for 15-30 mins depending on what time of the day you show up. It's still worth the wait.",

On my most recent trip I tried the del Rey - my goodness, what a heaping pile of meat.  There was egg, pork, cheese, ham, chorizo, some kind of hot dog, avocado and who knows what else.  I dumped their salsa on top (delicious!) and experienced pleasure through about half the sandwich, then very quickly reached a threshold and now I probably won't be able to eat a torta or any kind of processed meat for about a month without curling up into ball and sobbing.  In past trips I've chosen smaller, less ambitious items and made it through the visit purely in the pleasure zone.  Outside of the entrees, another reason we come here is the aquas frescas -  again, a bit gimmicky in that they are humongous, super sweet and come decked out with garnishes and umbrellas and such.  But they are quite delicious and great to share -- only problem is the wife always orders the regular, and I prefer them with sweetened condensed milk...",

I have lived in Phoenix for over 20 years and I even had a Mexican roommate who made awesome Mexican food all the time.  So I think I know my Mexican.  This was probably my fourth visit to Los Reyes.  My wife and I decided to have Mexican food for Cinco de Mayo.  I tried several new things.  I started off with the Tosada de Ceviche (Shrimp Ceviche) - Awesome flavors - just the right amount of lime/lemon and salt.  YUM!!!  Then I went with the Peluche plate packed with goodies (The steak was nicely seasoned and blended well with the sausage, ham, grilled onions, grilled peppers, pineapple, jalapenos).  My wife got the always amazing Del Rey.  We also threw on a plate of Chiles Toreados (grilled jalapeno and onions).  Everything was fantastic.  Oh yeah - they also have great Aqua Frescas.  We have taken out-of-town guests to this restaurant who also loved it.  My wife and I are surprised that we don't come here more often.    Other items that I've tried at Los Reyes that I liked as well.  Tacos de Cabazea Tacos de Asada Torta Nortena with Steak (Tacos de Lengua - not 100% sure that I have tried it here...)  I reserve my 5 star ratings for only my favorite restaurants - Los Reyes is definitely one of them!",

As I walked in I went through my checklist of pre-meal approval.  x Tasty Aroma x Other People  x People of the restaurant's nationality  x Satisfied Diners And a bonus of being able to see the chefs cooking.   The wait staff was friendly, patient, fast, amd attentive. I split the Torta Del Rey with my Father, my mother got the Sope, and my brother ordered a chicken Quesedilla. Let it also be known that there is an exotic, extensive, and large drink selection including a fantastic fruit selection.   As my meal came 10-15 minutes later I was not disappointed. The torta was huge and split in half, perfect to share. Instead of listing what was on the torta, it would probably be easier to list what was nt in the torta. It tasted like I was eating a farm. I will do my best to list out what was on this monster. Ham, Sausage Omelet, I think chicken, tomato, avocado, onion, and more! As a Jew, I have had a lot of great sandwiches, and this is right there at the top. By the time I was finishing I had to use my fork, for it was falling apart (always a good thing). My mother's Sope was delicious. As was my brother's quesidilla.   Now their drinks were absolutely amazing. I got the watermelon agua de frescas and I am still dumbfounded on how they made this. It looked like they took a hunk of watermelon, put it in a glass, and served it. But the description says there is also water and sugar. It was big, flavorful, and refreshing. I think that the drink is what a desert oasis must be like.   I will highly highly recommend coming here. I highly highly recommend getting the torta del rey. I highly highly recommend getting the watermelon drink. This was one of the best meals I have ever had. I recommend before you die and for your soul to come have a meal here. This was thoroughly good.",

They have a super duper salads also for a great app or as a meal.  But it's the torta's that I come here for!!  Yes they have loads of other things on their menu you can choose from if your not a torta kinda person, but then I would ask; \"why are you here?  Seriously?\"  :-)  The Torta Del Rey is crazy tasy but ginormous!!  You better have a HUGE appetite or plan to share this with a friend.  They still throw everything on this bad boy but the kitchen sink : -)  I would also suggest their Ranchera de pollo o res with either grilled chicken or steak, guac, fresh cheese, chopped onion & cilantro & a chipotle dressing.  or their Nortena de pollo o res with either grilled chicken or steak, onions & jalapenos with chipotle sauce, melted cheese, refried beans, tomato, avocado.    It's all good at Los Reyes De La Torta!!  I hope you give them a try if you haven't already!!  I'm looking forward to my next visit so I can try their new torta, King Carlos V.  It looks AWESOME!!

I am not a fan of Mexican burritos because something about the tortilla ruins it. This places has the most delicious Asada burrito which comes with beans, pico de Gallo, cheese, & avocado inside. They also give a side of cucumber & roasted onion/jalepeno, with lettuce. The burrito has so much flavor! It also doesn't get greasy and make the tortilla soggy. The customer service is always excellent. I love it so much that I haven't tried other things on the menu, but I will.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a sandwich for lunch, and on the Mexican side of flavors, you're looking for Tortas. This place caught my eye when I was thinking of what to eat for lunch the next day since I was in town for a conference. I think this place is definitely a lunch spot and popular among locals as when we went we saw this place pretty packed. The tortas came out pretty fast and let me tell you, the tortas are big. If you get their signature sandwich, the Del Rey, you will get a surprise of a torta full of different types of meats. This restaurant was featured on Man vs Food, and they make it apparent as there's a huge encased poster on the side of the wall.   Let's get to what I thought of their tortas. I got the Del Principe. Why did I not go all out for the Del Rey, their signature torta? When I read it on the menu, it just seems that there were so many flavors in the torta that it just would conflict with each other. I definitely wished that they offered a Al Pastor torta, but to my sadness I was disappointed that there wasn't one on the menu. So, ultimately what caught my eye was the Del Principe  which was easier to make sense as far as what they put in the sandwich. And I was correct when the sandwiches came out, as my other colleagues got a different sandwich I got to check out the Del Rey torta. That thing was massive, but for me it was nice and manageable.   I wouldn't say that this torta was the best I've ever had, as I've had some amazing rotas. I was just a little saddened that they did not offer an Al Pastor as one of the options of meats. However, for what they have and their twist on tortas and style I definitely recommend it if you're interested in trying something new. If you want a ton of flavors all at once I definitely recommend the Del Rey torta, however if you're looking for something simple where you can enjoy it, check the Del Principe out and see what you think. Sadly, I went restaurant hopping so I went to different places every day of the week so I didn't get to try out the other options. I definitely recommend here for lunch and tortas!",

    "text": "My friend Bill and I decided to come down here and check this spot out.  I have had it bookmarked for awhile now, and decided to knock it out this past Friday.    We both went with their signature sandwich, The Torta Del Rey.  I went with a full, and Bill went with a half.  This torta comes loaded to the brim with, to put it blunt, a shitload of stuff!  This thing comes with ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage (hot dog) and Mexican sausage (chorizo), tomato, onions, avocado, chipotle sauce and a smear of refried beans.  Yes, all that stuff comes on this beast!  It is served with a side of Ruffles chips.  Here is how it was.............  Torta Del Rey- Wow!  This thing was massive!  It was incredibly visually appealing!  I took a bite into it, and was pretty satisfied.  Even though there are a ton of meats in this sandwich, you could pretty much pick out each individual flavor.  I liked that aspect of it.  I didn't like a few things either, though.  First, the sandwich was just way too damn hot.  I should have let it sit for a few minutes. Second, I would probably get it without the hot dog and sausage.  They wrapped those up in the omelet/egg.  I wound up taking off the egg pocket on my 2nd half of the sandwich.  Even with the chipotle sauce, it was still a bit dry.  I ate the whole thing, along with the chips, and was stuffed to the brim.  Wasn't great, wasn't horrible.    Overall, I was glad that I made it down here.  I don't know if I would order the Del Rey again.  I would probably try out something else, something more simple like a plain carne asada torta.  I think I almost set myself up for failure though, too.  I have had many tortas from Wash Mobile Tortas down in Tijuana, and those are the best, and my all time favorites.  No other torta can compare. Service was friendly.  The price was a bit steep though, too.  The sandwich was huge, but even then, I don't think it justified the almost $14.00 price tag (after tip) for lunch.  Am I coming back?  Yeah, someday I'm sure I will make it back down here.  I'm not rushing to get back though.  A-OK.  3 stars.",

No alcohol, but let me tell you: the lemonade is awesome so no complaints about not having a margarita with the meal. This family-owned business is all about the food and the attentive and friendly service.   Once seated we ordered some refreshments and, after deciding on our order it wasn't even 5 minutes before they arrived; and the portions were, lets say, generous. Wow. I ordered the Torta del Rey. It's huge. And really delicious. Layers of assorted meats including bacon. Truthfully, I would have had enough with just one half and saving the other for lunch the next day. The price is more than reasonable given the size of the portions. This place is an amazing value for what you get and you will not be disappointed. Check it out. I definitely will return.",

They then top it with Jack cheese, avocado and a chipotle cream sauce. It's incredible.  The bread is super soft and light.  My favorite item here is the orange salsa.  It's sweet with a little touch of heat, I could honestly drink the stuff.  I ate there with a buddy and we went through like 5 of the little dishes, it's insanely good.

We opted for the original Del Rey torta and an amazing Aguas Frescas and Pina Colada. The drinks are HUGE! The tortas are even bigger. The only down side is their Ruffle-like side of chips they serve. I mean can't we at least get some tortilla chips or something. Throw us a bone here.  Other than those horrible chips, everything else is amazing. The flavor of meat in the torta is unbelievable. And make sure to order an Aguas Frescas. So refreshing and so ginormous.

    "text": "I actually liked the atmosphere of this quaint divey restaurant.  It reminded me of my 20s when I used to go to mexico for the day, or even for the weekend.  Growing up in San Diego, the border was a quick 10-15 minute drive.  We came here because it was featured on a television show.  The thing to order was the Del Ray Torta.  So we ordered that and the King Steak Tacos.  I thought the Del Ray was ok.  Each of the meats in it were tasty in its own right, BUT there was too much going on.  Like a pretty girl overly made up or like if you got all flavors of ice cream and blended it all together.  Tastes and looks good but not distinctive.  I took a few bites, was like..OK..yea.. um, sure..its good..another bite..hmph..nod.. I guess i was really trying to like it.  Now the King Steak tacos Suprised me!  A little on the greasy side, they were tasty and filling, with a price that was pretty decent for the amount of food on my plate.  I finished every last bite!  Service was indifferent.  Neither friendly nor unfriendly; They were there to do their job, which they did efficiently.  It was pretty busy, but things came out at a timely manner.  I don't think any of the waitresses eat the food here.  Every single one of them were in great shape, even the older ones.  I was envious.  I would return to try out another torta, and perhaps one of their delicious looking drinks.",

    "text": "For as much hype as this place got from my friends I was expecting some sort of flavor explosion to occur when I ate here. Instead what I got was a wait in a place with limited AC in AZ in the sumer for what was essentially a ton of different meats that weren't seasoned much thrown on a bun.   While the torta I got, the del-rey, wasn't bad it also wasn't fantastic. It tasted like what it was a hodge-podge of meats one would find in mexican food all thrown on a bun. It was hard to distinguish any significant flavors and the one I got the most was that of hot dogs.   I probably would have held this place up a bit higher if I hadn't gone to a torta place near work a few days later and had a very similar sandwich that actually had some distinct flavor and I didn't have to wait with little AC for it.  I might try this again if I lived closer but I am not driving out of my way for this.",

Food (as I'm sure many others did), a bunch of us were inspired to try the Torta Del Rey during lunch one day. This thing is monstrous! The size is incredible, and the taste is out of this world! I ate half of it and had to take the rest with me to eat later in the day.   Other than the epic Torta Del Rey, this little restaurant is just one of those great hole-in-wall places that has the best food in the area. If you're in SunnySlope for the artwalk, stop by this place before-hand and see how far you can get into the King of the Tortas!",

The staff is very friendly and you can never go wrong with any of the dishes you pick. If a torta is a mouthful, their quesadillas with handmade tortillas are delectable.

I ordered the 3 King Tacos for $8.99. You get your choice of chicken or steak, not both.  The meal is served with guacamole and rice or salad. The orange sauce they serve on the side is HOT!

To be honest te torta was just alright. I mean I actually finished it, but I felt like I had to keep eating it to like it more. It was just alright...I wouldn't order it again. I think it just too much going on in the sandwich I couldn't really like it.   Now my wife had the carna asalda tacos and they were very good! I found myself wishing I would have ordered the tacos. 3 giant sized tacos good deal for the price.   I will actually return to Los Reyes. I want to try the chicken torta next time and some tacos too. I wouldn't rate my experience bad here...just average. Hopefully I'll like it better next time not ordering the El Rey!!",

It comes with a great hot sauce (Red or green, with red being spicier.) that makes a great topping for the Tortas too.  The servings are huge and reasonably priced.  A couple could easily split an appetizer and torta.  I wanted to try the 10th anniversary Carlos V food challenge (Eat the thing in 15minutes and it's free), but they weren't offering the challenge anymore.  At $25 for the Torta Carlos V, I decided to stick with the very popular Torta Del Sol and was very pleased with my meal.  I left absolutely stuffed.  If you're looking for a smaller torta, we recommend the Torta Mexicana.  it is similar to a fresh Philly Cheese Steak with guacamole.  They don't serve alcohol.  However, the business is located on an extremely busy street with lanes that close from 4-6pm and I wouldn't order a drink, even if they offered them.",

I was quickly seated by two young and bubbly waitresses.  Did I mention that this place is always packed?!  I found out why!  I started my meal by ordering the Aguas cremosas - $4.50.  I ordered the Canteloupe (choices of  strawberry, mango, banana, papaya, or canteloupe). The fresh fruit was mixed with carnation and sweet cream.  It tasted like a canteloupe shake with delicious condensed milk!   INSANE!!!!

Served with chopped onion & cilantro with garnished salad.  HOLYSHAMADIGIGGIDY!!!!  This sandwich was HUGE, delicious, and insane!   I literally ate only 1/4 of this sandwich.

It wasn't the restaurant's fault we had to wait 45 minutes for our table, but it is their fault that it took more than 30 minutes to get our drinks after we placed our order.  And they didn't even bring us waters in the mean time!  Even though this place is famous for its tortas, the tortas actually didn't look that appetizing.  My friends who ordered them described them as \"Mexican burgers.\"  I'm not really into that, so I ordered the carne asada tacos.  They were tasty, and I actually finished all 3.  The sides of raw radishes and cucumbers were a little strange, but it wasn't bad.  If I were to go again (which I doubt because the wait was so long and there are plenty of other - better - Mexican restaurants in town) I would order the chicken quesadillas.  I tried a bite of one and it was really good.  On top of that it was pretty smoky inside the restaurant due to poor ventilation in the kitchen.  I hate leaving a restaurant and having my hair and clothes smell like smoke/food!",

Menu is huge, lots to choose from, lots of odd stuff I'm not familiar with. Had a full-size Nortena with chicken. Absolutely kicked ass. Great flavor, great bread, all the veg was fresh. I annihilated the whole thing. Loved the grilled onion and jalapeno it came with. They could leave out the dry cucumber slices on the side, though.   Reasonably priced, and the order was ready to go when I got there.   Will definitely be back, though I doubt I would ever dine-in. Not exactly the nicest atmosphere or area.",

I love Mexican.  but face it... we've both been lazy haven't we.  we go to the 'berto's places. we have our favorite Tex-Mex neighborhood joints.  and maybe we got a wild hair and went to La Parilla Suiza for a different style of Mexican food.  but we haven't pushed the envelope, and it's time we did!  so get yourself over to Sunnyslope and try Los Reyes de la Torta.  First of all, brace yourself.... you will not get chips and salsa.  and when you look at the menu, you won't see your fave burritos or tacos offered.  get over it.  your mouth is about to be the happiest part of your body!  they offer a wide variety of \"tortas\" (sandwiches to you, gringo) and like any good sandwich place, you order them with \"The Works\".  At Los Reyes, that means a whole pile of ingredients and they're all suicculent.  Agua Fresca?  Just say yes and name a fruit... within moments, a giant margarita style glass will be placed in front of you containing a smoothie based on aforementioned fruit plus a giant garnish of same.  I ordered the Mango version and cannot remember ever sipping  a more satisfying, delicious concoction, which went perfectly with my torta choice, the Del Rey torta, large enough to pose a serious challenge to Adam Richman on Man vs. Food.  In my case, Food won, but the torta, containing pork, ham, beef, eggs, guacamole, onions, tomatoes, cheese, chorizo, and yes even a hot dog, was a glutton's wet dream.  I suggest you come with a group of at least 6 people so you can order a bunch of different things and share them around. Try this place.",

If you don't know what that means, you probably have no concept of real Mexican food (and FYI, burritos are NOT real Mexican food) and need to travel outside of the resorts in Rocky Point, Cancun, Acapulco, etc.  My wife (del D.F.) and I are here every weekend because this is the real deal.  The tortas are equivalent to (and, in some cases, much better than) those to be found in Mexico City (and yes I can say that from experience).  Their quesadillas, sopes, and huaraches are huge and are on-par with everything we've found in el D.F. and el Edo. de Michoacan.  Not sure how they can mimic the authentic taste of la masa de maiz here in the USA, but they certainly pull it off.  All ingredients are fresh, and the meats are juicy and delicious.  Ceviche is top-notch.  If you do want to Gringo/Norteno out, they do have burritos with green and red chile sauceand flour tortilla quesadillas.  Atmosphere is friendly and clean--this is not gourmet, but not a hole-in-the-wall either.  The original 7th Street location is the best we've found in the entire US--bar none.  The Western location leaves a little to be desired in terms of taste and service.  Plenty of wait staff fluent in both English and Spanish, so be patient and they'll take great care of you!  CANNOT GIVE A HIGHER RECOMMENDATION!!!",

I met Mr. Hottie and Foodie Bear for lunch one afternoon at Los Reyes. I will say that I'm not a HUGE fan of sandwiches, but when it's free, what the heck? I walked in to the strip mall establishment and was met by the aroma of grilled onions and meat! So far, so good!  Once seated, I found my eyes wandering around the menu and wishing I could eat everything on it!  After sipping on a delicious horchata, and pondering the menu, I decided on the Torta el Rey which means \"torta that has everything but the kitchen sink in it\" (loosely translated)! This AMAZING sammie came with breaded thin beef steak, ham, chorizo, fried egg, cheese, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and jalapeno! This is CERTAINLY not something you want to feed a family member who is at risk of kicking the bucket due to heart or kidney issues. Consider yourself warned. I will say that if you eat this sandwich, you are bound to fall in love with it. It's a dangerous, forbidden love, but a love you will cherish nonetheless.  One of the issues I have with sandwiches is the bread. In previous experience, the tortas that I ate had terribly boring bread, or bread that was way too hard. Los Reyes' bread was yummy! It was grilled and and crusty, but not so crusty that you cut your mouth or it's too hard. The ingredients of the torta were all well made and delicious. Everything was HOT where it needed to be and cold and fresh where that needed to be! Perfecto!  So why is that 5th star missing? I want to head back to try another torta to be sure of a 5 star rating!  Looking forward to it!",

I'm not into many Mexican foods, but I do like some tortas and tostadas, etc.  I ordered the Del Rey, so I could get a taste of one of their popular choices.  The order came with chips, which weren't that crispy, but the sandwich itself was probably worth the money already.  I think I would've enjoyed it more if I didn't try to finish it all at once, but I didn't have a microwave in my hotel room and didn't want it to go to waste.  I think half of the sandwich would have been enough already.  So make sure to come when you're really hungry.   The ham was a little on the drier side, but the cheese wrapped with the sausage and the beef was really good.  But I think it's better to share it with someone!",

I had half a regular torta with the tender slices of  beef (mmm...little slices of heaven), avocado,  that pork, all on a white roll. And there's no way I could finish a whole torta. So, from a budget standpoint, it's even more worth the money. Also tried one of their huge huarache, corn tortilla that was snowed on by queso fresco. Anyone who goes must have one of their fresh fruit juices. They have a wonderful variety and it's a nice kick with meaty, not-sweet menu. It's definitely one of those places where there are more natives than gringos, which is a good sign.",

Actually, I've never tried a torta before last night -- and to think, I used to call myself a cultured Mexican food aficionado.  This place is bomb, that's all there is to it. I had the pechuga asada torta (bomb), side of guacamole (so bomb), pineapple agua fresca (way bomb), and half of my girlfriend's estillo del rey quesadilla (SUPER BOMB). The guacamole was some of the best I've ever tasted, although I heard some complaints about an overload of cilantro. Man up, cilantro is awesome.  The prices were a little high from what I would expect out of a dinky little Mexican restaurant, but I guess after you're featured on Man vs. Food you're allowed to overcharge. Or if your food is this damn good.  The next time I go, I'm definitely going to scoop up a strawberry agua fresca -- I tried my friend's, and it was... you guessed it, turbo bomb. It's a little bit of a drive from North Scottsdale, but any man will drive a few extra miles for some good tacos.",

It's nothing fancy.  Expect to see all kinds of people, lots of them, and they are all talking loudly.  This afternoon, when I was there, the place was packed with Hispanic families with lots of small kids, a bunch of older white haired people who must live nearby and their newspapers, a couple of tourists, and a nice kid who said his brother had sent him to pick up dinner.  He had never been there and looked around cautiously at the place until the waitress finally spoke English to him.  Since the place is named for the beautiful sandwiches they serve, I will start with those...  soft buns are loaded with different combinations of ham, breaded beef, pork sirloin, eggs,  chicken, cheese, guacamole, assorted peppers or chilies, tomato and sometimes a little onion... One torta is more than enough for 2 people.  They have taco plates with 3 tacos for under $5.  Their tacos come in varieties you may not have considered before... How about beef tongue tacos? or perhaps beef brains?  For the less adventurous, they have Hawaiian (beef, bacon, ham, bell peppers, pineapple, and cheese) or chorizo.  I like the shrimp quesedillas... also big enough to split. There are a lot of different shrimp dishes on the menu.  I should try a few others, but every time I walk in the door, I can hear the quesedilla calling my name.  They have fresh fruit drinks served in fishbowl sized goblets, and different kinds of fruit cocktail with whipped cream, honey or sweet cream for dessert.  They also have flan in different flavors.  I noticed a good breakfast menu that is served before 11 am, but I have never tried it. I think I would end up going home to sleep off the food if I tried to eat a big meal like that in the AM.",

Ingredients had to be fresh and good quality. Otherwise, the whole sandwich would've been thrown off.

    "text": "While I can't bring myself to give Los Reyes a full 4 stars, I can't say this place doesn't deserve the mad bum rush of hipsters who are flocking to it. Apparently some show came here, ate a torta, and now everyone decides that tortas are THE thing to eat.  The good: - well, they build the right kind of torta. Not your flimsy bolillo, Los Reyes uses teleras which we all know is the only way to build a torta.  - AMAZING milanesa. How amazing? I don't even LIKE milanesa but it was ridiculously good.  - huge plates. By huge, I mean Goliath would eat one of these plates and definitely get the 'itis.   The bad: - weak horchata. It's not homemade. Well, they might make it but it tastes like the pre-packaged kind.  - Carne asada torta is not made with arrachera. If you're going to give me cecina, tell me. Don't call it arrachera and give me tough steak.  - location. Where in the world is this place? I was in Phoenix? I might as well drive to Gilbert. No, nevermind, no one wants to drive to Gilbert. - no alcohol. Don't advertise a margarita and then tell me afterwards that it's alcohol free.   I always start out with 5 stars. I took one off for them messing up my order (I asked for no avocado and they gave me extra avocado), and one off because the carne asada steak wasn't so great. It should be half of one but blame yelp.   Will I be back? Whenever my little aztec warrior princess stomach needs milanesa, I might just drive up here for it. It's that good.",

    "text": "I have been on a quest for good Mexican ever since I relocated to AZ and for the most part what I have found is mediocre food at best. I happened upon this place by reading reviews right here on Yelp. Although I am a fan of Man vs Food I have not seen the episode where this location is featured but apparently many others have. After reading the rave reviews I had to check this place out and let me tell you I highly recommend this joint.   The food: My friend and I ordered Taco's, a Quesadilla and the Del Rey Torta all of which were wonderful. The serving sizes are large. They are not stingy here. The presentation is nice also. The Del Rey Torta is huge and definitely needs sharing. We also ordered the Aguas Frescas in strawberry and mango and they were wonderful as well. If you are in the area definitely check this place out.  Note. This place gets packed. I visited at 11am on a Saturday and people were lined up to be seated. While my party was seated almost immediately service from that point forward was substandard but the food made the wait for service worth it.",

    "text": "I was surprised when I walked in; I had the impression from the exterior that the place was much smaller, and I expected only a counter, and perhaps a few tables. Pleasant surprise to be seated, with a waitress to attend.  The menu alone made my mouth water, just envisioning all the dishes.  I chose the Del Rey Torta, simply for the meat content, which is considerable, and it has egg. You can't go wrong with egg on a meat sandwich.  When the sandwich arrived, I thought perhaps my meal, and my mother's, were on the same plate; it was huge! It could easily feed a small family. Or a large chef. :)  One thing that was odd; potato chips with my torta. I suppose it was ignorant of me to think that a mexican food place would have tortilla chips, but that's what I've been conditioned to expect. Upon reflection, potato chips are a more fitting accompaniment to a sandwich, contents of said sandwich notwithstanding.  The salsa that was served with the meal was phenomenal. Not too spicy, but a nice bite, with a slightly smoky flavor. Delicious!  The sandwich was, as the menu implies, a meat paradise, with egg. I can't recall for certain, but I believe there were 5 kinds of meat, including chorizo. You can't ever go wrong with chorizo.  The prices are very reasonable, even ridiculously low, given the volume of food.  The torta turned out to be much more than I could finish in one sitting, but I think I may have been intimidated. I will have to challenge the menu again, at a later date.  I would recommend Los Reyes to anyone seeking something non-traditional, in the Sunnyslope area. Its location on 7th street makes it equally favorably for those traveling from downtown, even on public transportation.  I will definitely be returning.",

    "text": "Fun!  That's how I'd describe our experience at Los Reyes De La Torta.    Picture it - a lazy scorching hot Sunday in Arizona. We had already met our beer quota for the weekend and needed to dry out.  What to do besides Netflix or DVR?  My fiance suggests a cheap lunch at Los Reyes de la Torta.  Sold!!  Forget the fact that, yes, we DID find out about this restaurant via Man vs. Food.  It just seemed too tempting NOT to try it since Adam actually visited a restaurant in the 602!  We knew what we were getting into - a huge torta big enough to feed two!  We were ready!  Upon arrival - it looked packed!  Although located in what people might describe as a \"sketchy\" area of town, we never felt that vibe.  Just an eclectic mix of people, families, couples, kids, milling around outside.  We thought for sure we were in for a long wait!  Wrong!  First off - the restaurant is actually bigger than it appears.  There were three different sections for diners to eat.  We were seated immediately at a table near the entrance which suited us just fine. We already knew what we wanted.  One Torta del Rey please!    We decided to share it - I knew I just wanted a taste (my body is not accustomed to that much meat at one time).  The waitress took our order in a matter of seconds.  Such prompt, and friendly service!  We knew it must be an authentic hangout because a bulk of the wait staff spoke broken English.  always a good sign - like when I go to an authentic Chinese Restaurant.  I expect the staff to be incomprehensible.  I also look for other Asians in the restaurant as validity.  Los Reyes de la Torta definitely seemed like a locals spot - very authentic - which made us like it even more.  So - within about 5 minutes - our order was up!  And OMG was it great!  Huge torta - layered with meats.  I won't list them because most of our fellow yelpers already have - I just want to say that the flavor was amazing!  Such a good deal and so much meat for only $7.99.  Served with potato chips and two different kinds of salsas (green and red) red being my favorite because it was spiciest.  Very very good salsa.  The awesome thing about sitting in the main area by the entrance was that we had full view of the kitchen.  My fiance and I stared in awe, watching how fast the chefs were able to churn tout the food.  Everything was made fresh - we wondered how many of the Torta Del Reys they actually cook each day! Most people ordered that.  The reason for the four stars is because although the sandwich is HUGE as is - there is an option for extra meat for a cost.  Of course - this is what had been served to Adam in the Man vs Food episode.  There is  a definite difference as to what was aired on TV.  We decided not to order extra meat this time around - and to save that for a time when we could go with a group of people.  Again the torta is meaty enough as is, the extra meat version be fun to do as a challenge with friends.  Overall a super fun time and a great experience.  Fast, friendly service and good fresh food.  Oh - and clean! Super super clean!  That was a surprise.  I've been to enough sketchy Chinatown restaurants and have become somewhat immune to that dirty feeling - but this restaurant was definitely well kept!  They also serve a huge selection of frozen drinks (both alcoholic or virgin) that I want to try next time!  Definitely give Los Reyes a try - or if you want a fun experience - take a group!  The food alone is entertaining enough!",

    "text": "It's now been a day later and I've finally awoken from my food coma to write this review.  I first saw this mentioned on Man vs. Food and figured if it was good enough for a food critic to give a thumbs up, it was worth a shot.  All four of us ordered the Torta del Rey but on the back of the menu I see this extra entry that says \"Extra meat on Torta $4\", so I ask the waitress if what Adam had gotten was a del Rey with extra meat to which she confirmed in the affirmative.  So that is what I order, my less adventurous companions all order just the regular del Rey.  15 minutes later this meat Juggernaut on a plate surrounded with Ruffles chips is before me.  This is the most massive thing I've ever seen and could definitely be a front runner for an eating competition.  The sandwich was about 8 inches long and would say about 5-6 inches high.  It towered over my coke can as I, my friends, the waitresses and many other customers came by to take pictures of this gargantuan meat monstrosity.  Everyone elses torta was cut in half, mine was sadly not but held together with two skewers.  All the layers of meat inside of the torta were succulent and delicious, the size did make for a bit less enjoyable experience since each bite had to be performed in a quadrant so all the available flavors could not be combined but were segmented.  I was probably good with only half the torta, which was about a pound, but goaded by everyone around I put on my Torta Warrior face and finished the other half much to everyone's amazement.  The chips don't seem to go well with the torta, would rather have had tortilla chips to dip in the salsas provided.  Overall a very inexpensive place to eat and for a little more you can probably feed two people off one sandwich.  A must experience for anyone in the north valley.",

Go to Gallo Blanco and its flavored water in a normal glass. Here its a \"big drink\" glass with an umbrella and fruit on the side, a little embarrassing as a guy with his guy friends. Still good, just a word to the wise. It's more like a blended margarita than what I thought aguas frescas was supposed to be (like at Gallo Blanco).",

The staff here are always very friendly and their menu has much more than just the quesadillas but seriously, get the quesadilla. My buddy ordered something else off the menu that he said he loved, and a crazy looking drink that looked like something you could only get at state fairs, but he speaks better Spanish than I do. He said everything was great. All in all, this place has one of my highest recommendations for Mexican food in the Phoenix area. If you got the craving, this place will satisfy.

Nortena de Res o Pollo Torta  On my quest for the best torta in Phoenix, I surprised my guest and picked up a Nortena de Res o Pollo ($8.99). Fill to the max, this sandwich was stuffed with seasoned grilled chicken, onions and jalapenos, melted cheese, tomato, avocado, chipotle sauce with the refried beans slapped on the bun. How could this be legal? All the ingredients mingled together as each bite grew bigger and bigger. We were fighting for the next bite until there was no more. Note to self: order a second one. This is definitely a \"hearty\" meal. The bun was soft and everything remained intact.    Luckily, I called in my take out order to avoid waiting in line because the establishment was completely filled during the lunch hour. As I peaked inside, it was a compact eating area with the waitresses hustling to take orders. We thoroughly loved our meal and hope to try it again in the future.   The restaurant is located in a small mini-mall and parking is available in front. If you plan to visit here, make sure to order any of their 26 tortas because you will not be disappointed.   Los Reyes De La Tora is definitely a contender to be one of the best tortas in Phoenix from us!",

A white rice is served with many of the dishes and I admit to not being very excited when I saw it on my plate but let me tell you; this rice is unlike any I've ever enjoyed before. It is truly fluffy and has a slight sweet/spicy flavor to it. My husband ordered one of the tortas and it was HUGE!!! He and I could have split the torta and still have leftovers! He ate half and saved the other half for lunch the next day! Service is great; very attentive but not smothering. Definitely returning!!!",

I am from CDMX and I can tell you that this is the real deal.  The signature torts in my mind is tie between the ranchera and the nortena.  The crunchy bread with the perfectly seasoned beef, caramelizad onions, avocado, chipotle and cheese just combine to have a stellar party of yumminess in your mouth.  Love the fact that you can order mini or regular size.   The tostada de ceviche and the tostada de tinga to start off as appetizers are also a staple -- simply delicious.  The newly added \"Molletes\" brought back fond memories during my childhood.  I certainly went to a very happy place.  Breakfast served all day with chilaquiles or huevos rancheros round out the menu.  This place is family friendly, taste bud friendly and wallet friendly.  Whenever I am in town, I make it a point to stop by and get my fill of Vitamin T!  #TortaPower",

I know they are famous for their tortas, but it was a late night stop and I didn't want to eat some beastly, 11lbs, torta.  So, I settled on the Bistec Encebollado tacos.    The flavor was spectacular and the meat was tender and easy to chew through.  I hate when you take a bite of a taco and pull all the insides out...   The only downside, IMO, is that I couldn't have a beer with my tacos.  It's not enough downside to warrant a 4 star rating, but maybe a 4.5 star if that was an option.

Next they charged us for extra onion that we had requested not to be put on another plate already, they charged me over a dollar for 2 wedges of lime LITERALLY 2 small wedges. Finally the bill ... we handed her 2 credit cards ( one for each bill) she charged both bills on one credit card... and gave back each credit card with a receipt. Make sure you look at your receipts, the waitress at the front didn't even apologize or tried to fix it she just said \"oh\".",

We were still able to get a table, but they are very close to other tables...unless you want to sit in the lap of another person...  -Restroom is very clean.  -Pay your check with the cashier up front.  -Parking is not so convenient. The spots are very tiny, maybe meant for those Eurpean Smart cars. It's like a normal size parking spot that was split in two...is this to give the illusion of MORE parking spots? Someone parked so close to me, I thought I was going to have to climb into my car through the back window.",

One thing that hit me was how low quality the ingredients were, the meats tasted like they were purchased in the lunch meat aisle at a supermarket, and brand X meat at that. It didn't taste fresh, and in my sandwich's case (the La Reyna) like they used the cheapest sausage they could find. The breaded chicken on the sandwich had extremely sweet and cheap tasting batter on it. Even the egg tasted like it came out of a carton. Perhaps I just picked a poor sandwich, but my fiancee was not a fan of the Del Ray either, one of their favorite menu items.  Since I do not want to focus on the bad, our drinks were constantly attended to, the food came quickly, and for the price vs filling your belly was positive. Then again when you use such, apparently, cheap ingredients it is no wonder they can keep prices low!  It was a unique experience, just to see the massive sandwiches but we will not be going back.",

At first a bit put off by this obvious isolation but quickly greeted by a pleasant young woman who proved both friendly and efficient we decided to stay, outcast or not, and what followed was actually a very impressive lunch at a bargain basement price.  Once (unbeknownst to us) featured on \"Man vs. Food\" it became obvious soon on opening the menu which items were considered signatures and with myself opting for the Del Rey while my mother and aunt went with similar, less gaudy options, plus a pair of icy mixed drinks similar in texture to the Slush-Puppies of my youth but far more delicious; the Arnold Palmer especially excellent with light bitter and a lot of sour without being overly sweet.   Moving on to the food, with each sandwich served on a fluffy and yeasty bolillo roll stuffed with flavorful meat and top quality produce, I can honestly say that every single bite of the Del Ray exceeded my expectations while both my mother and aunt seemed happy with their selections, as well.  Generally not one to order a sandwich as I find them monotonous after a couple of bites the Del Ray succeeded where so many others failed because each bite was slightly different from the last, some smoky, some spicy, some saline, and others creamy and rife with fresh avocado.  Large, easily enough to share, and certainly not for the faint of heart this is definitely the sort of dish that could have flopped and become nothing but a gluttonous mess but in reality, despite all the ingredients, never once did something seem unnecessary or overwhelming to the other ingredients...and as much as restraint probably would have been wise I enjoyed every last bite, a fact that *almost* made me glad they were sold out of their signature King Cake; though the dense \"Chocoflan\" of moist chocolate pudding cake meets smooth, creamy flan was quite rich itself.   With the Del Rey ringing in at a mere $9.50 I find it hard to believe that there is any place in the city offering more interesting Mexican food at a better value, though if there is I need to seek it out...right after I find some dining pals to head back to Los Reyes for Pambasos and Huaraches and some King Cake.",

Over the years, the celebrity chefs that have TV programs, i.e. Guy Fieri, Adam Richman, etc., in my opinion have been right less than half of the time with their suggestions. This one though is a WINNER! We both had the steak with queso fresco and avocado on a Mexican roll... DEEELICIOUS! Score 1 for Man vs. Food.  No alcoholic beverages.",

It's not really a knife and fork type of sandwich either. You get a choice of chips or \"salad\" and I went with the salad. It's cucumbers, radishes, and grilled onion on top of shredded lettuce. Tasty, but it should just say \"fresh veggies\" and not salad! I also didn't like how most of the menu was in spanish. I know some spanish, but not that much! They should have both english and spanish versions of the detailed items.",

    "text": "Being in Phoenix for the summer, I decided to get Los Reyes De La Torta a shot instead of La Tolteca, which is a much shorter drive from where I am living.   Went at about 6:30 on a Sunday evening with a buddie and had no wait at all. Good atmosphere. Had great, prompt service. Our waitress never let our drinks get below half way and was simply fantastic. Restaurant is in a small plaza but does not feel (and is not) dirty or grungy or anything of that sort. I ordered the Del Rey while my friend ordered the beef tongue torta. Both came out in about fifteen minutes just as we ordered them. Once again, very very good service.   The only reason I am not giving Los Reyes five stars is probably my own fault. I got the Del Rey because of all I had heard about it, but probably should have gotten something that is more my taste. However, the sandwich was fantastic, the meat was juicy and tender, and the egg and avocado made it truly enjoyable. No complaints about the beef tongue either.  All in all, if you are in the neighborhood give this place a shot. Great service, very good food, and very affordable. I will definitely try to make the drive again while I am in town.",

After a studying the menu for quite some time, I ordered the Arizona torta along with a Pina Colada drink. Figured this should fill me somewhat.  The Olympics were on tv, which garnered most of my attention, until the food arrived. It probably took ten minutes or so for the waitress to return to our table with our glorious, fancy, fruit decorated drinks and a moundful of torta goodness. One bite of the sandwich= instant fan. The sandwiches are really large, so even half was enough. I will definitely be back. Next time, I will try the chilaquiles with eggs and steak...mmmm",

    "text": "I am just going to piggyback many of my fellow Yelpers here, and say that my first visit to Los Reyes de la Torta, which was for dinner tonight was as good as I have heard and hoped it would be!   My dinner company and I arrived for dinner here around 5:30pm, and the restaurant was busy but we were still seated immediately. Our waitress was at our side ready to help us immediately, and was very helpful and patient with us because we had never been here before. We ended up sitting right under the Man V Food framed and illuminated poster on the wall, and decided upon the Del Rey torta which Adam ate on the show. My guest got a diet coke and I one of the aqua frescas cantaloupe flavor and it was unbelievably refreshing and flavorful. It even came with a slice of cantaloupe on the side of the glass and I could tell the drink was freshly made just for me.  Our dinner, the Del Ray, well, it was heaven on a bun, and comprises of just about every kind of meat in existence including chorizo, ham, beef and hot dog and egg. However, the meat proteins were not too overwhelming and were balanced out very nicely by the avocado, veggies and cheese. Further, the torta bread was awesome, and retained its crispy shell and fresh, spongy inside with each bite. The sandwich was spicy but not hot (but if one chooses to put the chipotle sauce on the sammy, eater beware!). For two grown adult males, the Del Rey torta was a good meal to share with a side of rice and beans (both of which were fantastic as well!). The sandwich comes with ruffled potato chips, and my guest commented that he was surprised it did not come with tortilla chips instead, but both of us thought the salty potato chips actually enhanced the overall flavor combination of the torta and meal in general, and tasted great with the chipotle sauce.   During the meal we noticed dishes being taken to other tables and my guest and I both decided we would have to come back and try the other dishes too, as the ingredients were so authentic and fresh that I am certain all the dishes taste fantastic, as did our Del Rey.   In the end, dinner cost just over $20 including tax and tip and drinks...an awesome deal for the meal and service. Some other posters have commented on this location's lack of curb appeal and overall cultural scenery, but as someone who values food quality more than flash and trendiness, I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone looking for a great meal for themselves, their partner or family night out!!!",

I decided to order the claim to fame giant king cavalier torta. I ordered an agua de pina and it was great and when i asked for chips and salsa the server said they only had potato chips and no tortilla chips.............. (weird)........ Ok- so no chips LOL.  The torta arrived and it was HUGE!!! So I'm all excited about this giant Mexican sandwich but then I realized that I'm not going to be able to bite into it because it's so huge (that's what she said- I know) ok so I split the sandwich in half to only have one top portion half to start ingesting.  There is every animal inside of this thing. Literally.  Ham, pork chop, hot dog, shredded chicken, carne Asada, and fried chicken, and chicken fried steak ( I think?) ok so like the top half started out good but then I got grossed out with all the meat and then took off the fried chicken an chicken fried steak.  Then I threw off the hot dogs.  Then I just decided I was disgusted and just left it.  I honestly thought I was going to vomit on the way home because I just ingested who knows how many calories and didn't even find joy in it.  Oh- and our bill was $38.00 (the sandwich is $20 alone plus I got the agua de pina and a sprite.  I tried it at least? Bleh.",

    "text": "Los Reyes de la Torta has the best Mexican sandwich as advertised. The deluxe torta with a lime agua fresca is just about all you need when you're hungry and want some great food. Not fancy, but it's clean, the people are friendly, the kitchen is open (and again, clean) and best of all the food is really good. The interplay between the meats on the torta are wonderful. The place doesn't look like much from 7th Street - in fact we drove right past it the first time - but turn in and enjoy. Highly recommended.",

They dont serve chips and salsa but u can buy that seperate. Their portions are good size. Good price. No wait time this evening,  depending the time u go (I.e. lunch, early dinner or Saturday evening) they may have a bit of a wait.",

I tried the Del Rey which is thier largest sandwhich, Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo, tomato, lettuce, avocado, eggs and who knows what else was on there. I could only eat half. Now I have never had a Torta before so I have nothing to compare it to, But it was delish, my wife has a burrito which she also liked. Service was excellant, very friendly staff. They were playing Vicente Fernandez videos on the flat screens why we were there for luch providing some background ambience.  For Dessert we had Fresas Con Crema which was to die for. It wasn't on the menu, so just request it.  The only con was the limited parking but well worth waiting to find a parking spot. Can't wait to go back I heard the ceviche rocks.",

    "text": "After reading Rand's review about a month ago, I just I knew had to check this place out! I stopped by Monday after work with a list of items I'd like to try (I looked at their menu online before coming in). I ordered way too much for my husband & I, but it was my 1st time so I had to try a lil bit of everything. I got the following: shrimp ceviche tostada, carne asada burrito, carne asada tacos w/a side of rice & beans, cheese quesadilla (flour tortilla), carne asada quesadilla (corn tortilla, handmade!) \"estilo del rey\" style (meaning it's topped with cheese, sour cream & cilantro) & lastly a slice of chocoflan for dessert.   I had the tostada, burrito & carne asada quesadilla (over the course of 3 meals, btw) & all were excellent! Although, instead of shrimp I received chicken. It was still delicious but I was excited to try the shrimp, next time. The burrito had a lil kick to it & the meat was seasoned perfectly. The quesadilla was beyond amazing, I don't think I can ever eat a quesadilla again w/out getting it \"estilo del rey\" style, freakin yum! My hubby had the tacos, cheese quesadilla & half of my burrito. He thoroughly enjoyed everything & made 2 meals out of it. The chocoflan was chocolate cake topped w/a thick layer of flan. I didn't really care for the flan topping but the cake was tasty, super moist!   Total for all that food was about $33, which I find totally reasonable. I can say that this is one of the top places for Mexican in Phoenix. I can't wait to return & try all the other yummy things they have to offer!",

Super fresh salsa, plentiful lime wedges, And so much steak it was a tough job to power it all down. I mean, I totally did- but it was a bit of a challenge. The rice was only OK, and the beans were so-so. But the tacos were crazy good. They were also quite speedy which is always good when you are on lunch break.",

One in the group said \"I want Mexican.\" Jumped on Yelp and found Los Reyes. 4.5 stars with a boatload of reviews is great. Did not catch the Man v. Food references so that was a pleasant surprise when we arrived (being the food show junkie that I am). Actually tried the same torta that was featured on the show (split 4 ways ... 5 lbs is a lot of torta). I am a torta purist and the the hodge podge was a bit much but in general, tasty. That appetizer was great! Probably would be a 5 out of 5 if I had ordered a more traditional torta ... Who am I kidding, if I am in the area, I'll be back.",

It was like $10 for the torta and a can of soda and it was ready in about 5 minutes.  I have eaten a lot of very random and very no-so-good-for-you food in my day but this torta may take the lead.  As I started to chow down on my  Torta Del Rey 3 things went through my mind:  #1 - wtf am I eating #2 - my wife is going to kill me for setting my diet back 2 years and clogging my arteries even more #3 - how the fu*k am I supposed to eat this thing without getting it all over my shirt and pants.  I am a torta virgin and I think this might have been my first legit torta experience.  I have never in all my life seen a sandwich with so much sh*t piled on.  I took one bite like a normal sandwich then I gave up for fear of making a complete mess of myself.  I stuck to the fork and knife method which worked much better.  Anyway, the taste of the torta is just ok because there really isn't much flavor going on.  To be honest I was expecting an explosion of flavors from all the stuff on the torta but it was just eh.  The hot sauces (both red and green) were great and added to the flavor.    I would go back but would probably not have the torta.  The rest of their menu looks pretty good and authentic but after tasting their flagship cuisine; I'm not expecting greatness.  I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the uniqueness (at least to me) and authenticity of the food.",

The thing is huge, I'll give them that.  BUT it was DRY and lacked flavor.  It had all the bells and whistles.  Unfortunately, the last time I checked bells and whistles (as well as the kitchen sink) don't have flavor.  Neither did this torta.   My fiance is Mexican, and well- we know what a torta should taste like.  This was nowhere close to that.  Not even reaching substandard levels.    Came with chips.  It was to go, so why do they pack the chips in the same container with the hot torta.  Soggy chips!  Yeay, what a treat.    I ordered their king porkchop.  The spice was definitely there, but that was it.  Just a burning sensation in your mouth.  No other flavor.  The porkchop was dry as can be and severely overcooked.  It was like eating cardboard.  Rice and beans weren't seasoned.  Seriously?    And service?  Abysmal.  These girls working the front counter and \"serving\" have got a lot to learn.    What a disappointment.",

A few observations...  - A really biiiiggggg sandwich that comes out of the kitchen reeeeaaaallllllyyyy hot.  Almost too big and too hot to eat. - The hot dogs (or whatever they were) seemed to be of sketchy provenance.  I pulled them off the sandwich. - The avocado/guacamole on the sandwich was very good. - The bread/roll doesn't hold up to the size and composition of the sandwich...I ended up eating with a knife and fork.

    "text": "Here is my honest assessment of Los Reyes de la Torta.  It's a three-star place.  The atmosphere is a bit dumpy.  My apologies to those who think reviews should focus strictly on food, but atmosphere is what I notice when I walk in the door.  Plus, despite the fact that the place was mostly, we were led to the table closest to the restrooms.  Seriously?    The star of the show here is obviously the tortas.  I tried the egg one, which had cheese and a very generous serving of sliced avocados.  This torta was delicious and a great value.  The other one I tried had chicken, onions, and some other stuff.  It reminded me of what they have at the Great Steak and Potato Company.  Not that that's a bad thing.  For the tortas I give 5 stars.    Other stuff:  No alcohol.  'Nuff said.  Greasy potato chips as a side?  That was kind of a bummer.  I was craving tortilla chips or fries or anything a little more exciting than potato chips right out of the bag.  The flan was really dense and tasted like it was prepared forever ago in a huge vat.  Skip it.  You probably won't be hungry anyway after the tortas so don't get tempted by the pictures on the menu.",

They raised the price of it (because they can, I guess... which is a lame reason)  and it's really not a good thing to eat.     It's the sort of thing that might sound good if you're stoned past reason but I haven't been in that frame of mind in a decade or more,   and today even if I was I'd have the good sense to avoid dare sandwiches in general.   The rest of the tortas with balanced ingredient lists are still exceptional.      But the place really is a bit too busy,  so I'll probably not go back for a little while - it's not like Phoenix is short on great Mexican.",

It wasn't the best sandwich I've ever had, or even the best torta, but it was definitely above average.  The Torta Del Ray was packed with ingredients and flavor. It had egg, chorizo, hot dog, ham, beans, beef, pork, tomato, and avocado. It was such a large sandwich, it was hard to eat.    Although it was a massive amount of food, I finished the entire sandwich because it was so good.   The restaurant had an authentic feel to it as well, which enhanced the eating experience.",

I really feel like 98% of the menu is delicious. We love that they always have Mexican music on in the background. and my husband LOVES that there is always a soccer game on TV.

Only complaint is that by the end of the sandwich much of the good meat was gone and it was very difficult to keep it all together ( not quite enough cheese or sauce to hold it in place). Torta was pretty big, but I expected far more mammoth of a creation after reading so many people saying they couldn't finish it.   If you are hungry it is really pretty easy to put away (of course if you get drinks or apps, or eat the generic ruffles chips, you may get full).   Good price for good quality sandwich to go with good service. Four stars!",

However, my SIL asked us to meet them here two nights ago and I am so glad they convinced us to go!    The cameron burro is insanely delicious!  Chipotle crema, prefectly prepared tortillas, so much yum.    I ordered a fancy drink (I think this is a dry restaurant?) and it too me to the beach without the booze! Get the King pina colada, you gotta try it.  My husband ordered the king tacos (with steak) and he loved them.  SIL ordered the same as me, and her husband got another cameron dish that he really enjoyed.    We also got 4 ceviche orders to start and they were really tasty.   They are individual sized and a great way to begin your meal.    If you enjoy Tortas I'm still surr this is the place for you!  They just aren't my cup of tea apparently.  I've now learned that LRdlT can serve up delicious food no matter what you're looking for in a hole in the wall Mexican joint.  One last note:  this place is kid friendly too.

Arrived a little after the lunch rush and we were seated as soon as we got in th door. I order the Del Rey torta and it was more then emought foood... it was held together with two giant wooden skewers and came with two handfuls of ruffless chips.   The took our order and in less then 10 minutes our food was at our table.  We also were served  a red salsa that went get on top of the chips and torta..   There was a ton of meat on the torta and not your low quality stuff but good big sliced chunks of pork, nice and thin and lightly breaded milanesa..egg, chorizo, ham, sliced hot dogs, jalepenos, cheese, avocado, onion...etc etc....  The torta bread is some of the best I have had..  on the 2nd visit I had the Arizona and we started with the queso con chorizo and jalepenos toreados....  Torta was just as good as the one from two days before...  The queso con chorizo was enought for 3 people and they gave you quite a bit of chorizo too.  M only complaint would be the jalepenos...as they were not roasted long enough, out of the 6 we got only 3 were roasted the right way and the other three needed at leat 3 more minutes on the grill.... they were still raw and lacked that roasted taste...  But other thent that this place was legit.....  They havr a Monster 5+ pound torta called the King Carlos V.... during our 2nd visit two of them were ordered by another table and our waitress was kind enough to stop by our table to show it to us before dropping it off....  I thought my torts was huge  now this one was HUGE!!!   Will def be back  when ever I am in the Phoenix area",

    "text": "So... my first time to a Torta restaurant but I didn't get a Torta. I had the shrimp quesadilla with bell peppers, onion and cheese served in a huge homemade corn tortilla. The husband had  a similar dish but half grilled steak and half shrimp, refried beans, the grilled vegetables, and all on top of the huge grilled corn tortilla. Both were absolutely delicious. Plus they served corn tortilla chips and salsa with it all. Our server, Jennie, was great. She brought some old menus that had pictures of the dishes and that helped make the decision. The food looked exactly like the picture. I can't wait to go back. The iced tea is $3.00, just warning.",

It was thinly sliced chicken breast, tomato, melted cheese, avocado and grilled onion and peppers with a special sauce on a fresh hoagie roll. It's a huge sandwich. When they brought it out, I thought there's no way I'll eat this entire thing. Then I did.   I also had an order of chips and guacamole. They were both fresh and amazing. The guacamole was a somewhat spicy, so look out if you're averse to heat. I found it to be incredible.   This is by far one of the best places I've found in the Phoenix area. You've got to try it!",

More than one person came by to make sure that we had the menus we needed to place our order. They have a huge variety of food to choose from! The waitress was also kind and patient enough the help me decide what I wanted.  The aroma in the restaurant was very appetizing. My son kept commenting on it. Our food was prepared and brought to us quickly.  Here's where I think they went over the top. The manager must have noticed that we ordered two items for the three of us. Before we left with our to-go order, he informed us that for whatever reason, they had a red chili burrito that was unclaimed and offered to give it to us... For Free!  We accepted and thanked him for his generous offer. Then, before we left, they gave us a menu and warmly invited us back.  What a great staff they have there! Please stop by this place when you are in the mood to enjoy good food in the company of equally good people.",

They also have a fantastic juice bar where they make all of their own juices horchata and smoothies in house. They also have the usual Mexican sodas. They've definitely expanded their menu from tortoise too many items found in Mexican food. I have always gotten the Tortas and never tried anything else. I think next time I go there I will go with a group of people and get a few different items. My favorite torta is the Delray and if you are alone you should probably just get the mini because the regular size is definitely shareable for two people. Just look at my pictures or anyone's. They do not play around with portion size at this restaurant. Very reasonably priced as well.",

    "text": "I read about Los Reyes on Yelp earlier this year and have really wanted to try it. My boyfriend and I went on Friday and we REALLY enjoyed it! I used to be obsessed with tortas when I lived down in Guadalajara, so I was especially excited. I ordered a torta with chopped steak, onions, peppers, cheese, beans, avocado and more. Delicious! I could only eat half (half is about the size of a burger). I also got an horchata - really refreshing after the spicy-ness of the peppers and hot sauce.   My boyfriend got a steak torta and a Mandarin Soda. He LOVED it. He somehow managed to eat the whole thing!   Definitely want to go back and try more of their food and fresh juices. Highly recommend Los Reyes!!!",

Incredible flavors, piping hot as it just came off the grill, not from under a heat lamp. My wife and I both had the Torta Nortena, it was huge and delicious! Comes with your choice of chips or salad, get the salad! Fresh lettuce, radish, cucumbers, & a grill jalapeno and onion-mouth watering. The menu is huge and I can't wait to go back and try some of the other dishes. A friend that was with us got a platter and had to bring half of it home. The prices are very, very reasonable for what you get. I'll be taking all my out of town friends here. If they thought Chino Bandito was cool, wait until they get a taste of LRDLT!",

I rocked the \"Hawaiian\", my date rocked the \"Mexican.\"   We had a little ceviche tostada on the side, washed it all down with a pina colada and found ourselves in heaven.

I was worried that with being on TV (Man Versus Food, a personal fave of mine) that the food would be more of a gimmick and less of a diamond in the rough. Much to my party's delight, everything we ordered was tasty and well prepared. The neighborhood of Sunnyslope is a bit rough around the edges, but this is definitely a good find and a reason to visit.  For a business/work lunch, food was quick, service was polite and we ate a ridiculous amount of food. I can't wait to try a couple of the other amazing looking tortas!",

    "text": "If only it wasn't all the way up there... i'd be on it like a lush at the FEZ happy hour... margaritas, martinis oh my! Anyways that's how I would describe my dinner outing to Los Reyes de la Torta with my best, Sara V.   She thought of it and I bought it... so off we went after work on Monday night to Los Teyes de la Torta for some Torta goodness. The only Torta I've had prior is at Gallo Blanco. and they Ribeye there is delicious but here we were at Los Reyes and the menu was huuugggge! Sara V. was hungry so we started with an app, the chicharron quesadilla estilo del rey which is with queso, pico, onions, and jalapenos. I got horchata as a drink, and Sara V. got mango juice. Felt tropical and I guess it went with the feeling of mugginess outside. Anywho, the quesadilla was big, and really a meal in itself. For our entrees we decided to split two tortas, they were the Arizona Torta  and the Mexicana Torta - steak, sauteed onions, jalapenos. They were both big in its own right, half a torta is filling on its own.   Sum up our experience, the tortas are really good, altho i can always pass up the Mexicana and try something else. The horchata was alright, nothing phenomenal unlike La Condesa which has a very interesting and really yummy Horchata. Not a big fan of Mexican mangoes coz personally I don't think that they're sweet, Filipino mangoes are still Queen! The quesadilla was yummy, liked it very much. I think it's proof that when more than half their clientele are Latinos is that it's a good torta shop. The dinner was not pricey and I had leftovers but really liked it and will come back soon!",

This place is for sure a \"hole-in-the-wall\" joint, but at the end of the day what matters is the food.  I found the food to be extremely unique with fatty ingredients, but surprisingly not \"fatty\" tasting.  In all reality these sandwiches are HUGE.  I personally ate half of a half of the famous torta and some chicken quesadilla and I was done until the morning.  The aqua fresca was also right on point.  I had the pina one and it was delicious.    To sum it up, I really liked this place.  I plan on going back to try some of the great looking mexican food they have.  We didn't have to wait and the service was just fine.  Give this place a try... it is worth it for the experience alone, but the food doesn't hurt - that's for sure.",

    "text": "Have been here twice now in about a week. If I can make three, I would try it!  Love Mexican food and with Carolina's North down the street from us, it would seem hard to find a place that would give us a good Mexican food fix.    It wouldn't be fair to compare the two though...apples and oranges.  Have never really got into tortas before our visit here and this place is NOT your typical Mexican fast food place.  The atmosphere makes you feel like you are in a real Mexican restaurant.  The wait staff is super attentive and always cleaning up for you.  The food....The food is awesome.  Some simple advice.  Be adventurous.  While you might find some familiar fare, you have to try one of the tortas. They are awesome!  Have tasted three different ones and they were all excellent ( ordered the pork loin and the Alambre de Res...tasted my son's Lengua Torta...hmmmm).    On my last visit I met my cousin there.  He beat us and had already ordered a quesidilla.  That sucker is big enough for three people.  I was stuffed before we even put our order in, He doesn't like to stray from his comfort zone , so he insisted on ordering the tacos.  He also wanted rice and beans. For the most part, everything comes with a \"salad\" of shredded iceberg, grilled onions and jalepeno,sliced radishes, and lime.  When his order came, I think he was taken back by the white rice and white beans that it came with. I wanted to try them, but he does not share!  The  looked good, but I don't think I would order them..only cause the amount of food is already overwhelming. Twice it has put me into a food coma.  Try the agua frescas!  There horchata tastes homemade also...not like the stuff the serve at most places.",

    "text": "After seeing it on Man vs. Food, I had to try this out for myself.  The atmosphere was pleasant, and the food was pretty good for the price, but there was nothing that really jumped out at me.  I had the Torta del Rey, which has a ridiculous amount of food inside: eggs, ham, pork, chorizo, beef, cheese, tomatoes, jalapenos, avocado, and onions (I skipped the refried beans).  And I'm pretty sure there was a plain boiled hot dog in there somewhere.  It's interesting to have all of those meats in the same bite, but none of them really were spectacular.  The best of the bunch was probably the breaded beef, so maybe a sandwich focused on that beef might be a little more memorable.  When I saw that they have potato chips instead of the more common tortilla chips, I figured they must be good.  I've had some excellent homemade chips at several places in town.  But unfortunately, these were just original Ruffles, complete with the preservatives and grease.  For the price, I'd go again if I was in the area, but I don't think I'd make a special trip again.",

This Mexico City style Mexican food was not only tasty but 1 Torta would have been more than two people with a good appetite could eat. I had the Torta Del Rey, filled with beef, pork, ham, chorizo, cheese, a fried egg, and then topped with avocado, beans, tomatoes, onions, and jalapeno. At first I thought it was an unusual combination but I was wrong, it was very flavorful. I will definitely have that again!   The location is in a small strip mall and parking is limited.

It's bigger on the inside than what you expect with plenty of seating. Our server was super nice and gave us ample time. Unfortunately there's no alcoholic drinks but their pina colada & agua de limon was delicious!   We ordered tacos, i got steak and my friend, chicken. Portions were great but they weren't double wrapped with two tortillas so it was a bit difficult to pick up. Flavors were on point though!   I ordered another Torta, but to go. The nortena mini, not as good as the previous one i ordered but tasty! Came with ruffles this go around which will nice to snack on later on.   Highly recommend!!   -------- Girllllllll. This stuff right here is good. I ordered through Uber eats while visiting in AZ & im so glad i did!! Soon as i got it from the driver, i could smell the food through the container and my mouth started watering.   I ordered the del princepe Torta- im so annoyed i got the mini but the portion was good for the price. Be wary, some tortas  come with chips and some come with a salad slaw. Mine came with the salad which was nothing special. They also included a grilled jalopeno and some grilled onions on the side with a lime.   The chicken was delicious!! Well seasoned & the guac on top was fresh and had a good zing to it.   I may just order again before i leave",

This was years ago and now that I live close by it was time to revisit the unique style of Mexico City breaded sandwiches! Located in the Sunnyslope neighborhood of North Phoenix, off of 7th street & Hatcher road. I was not really sure what I wanted to eat since it was in the brunch hour, so the Del Rey Torta was my choice. This \"torta\" is like a breakfast meal, mixed with lunch! Soft and toasted bread, with ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, omelet, sausage and mexican sausage(salchica)  tomato, onions, & avocado! Basically a smorgasbord of deliciousness! I was able to call in the order to save some time picking up and the \"torta\" was very filling! \"",

We showed up thinking we could order some margaritas but all the beverages are non-alcoholic. Maybe pop a flask in your purse - tequila preferably - and pour it into one of those delicious looking frozen juices that they sell. So many people ordered the juices. I wanted one but the sugar intake without alcohol just wasn't worth it to me. Luckily, my husband willingly walked over to the Circle K across the street to pick up a 6-pack of cerveza. I was able to enjoy my delicious chorizo tacos (and 1/4 of his torta) with a cold beer.   His torta was massive. There was so much involved in this sandwich. I don't think I could eat the whole thing myself. It was interesting - I wish the bread was a bit more toasty or firmer because it was somewhat soggy at the bottom. I mean... look at that thing - all those items in it just weigh it down.  Service was friendly and establishment seemed clean. We'll be back to try it again!",

And thankfully, this place definitely knows what they're doing in this regard.  Embarrassingly enough, I didn't even know what a Torta was until my girlfriend introduced to me to them several years ago at their other Indian School location. Although El Reyes de la Tortas serves far more than just tortas, I'm now a bit interested to see how good some of their other offerings are, including their tacos and quesadillas.  In some ways, this isn't really traditional tortas, which my girlfriend repeatedly points out. There's a lot of ingredients packed in to these sandwiches. Some might say even too many ingredients. I've tried both the Del Rey and Arizona, which have so much stuff between the bread that I don't even feel like listing all of the ingredients. Both are great quality and are typically served with a pile of Ruffles chips.   Prices are reasonable, service is quick, and the place was pretty jam packed on the Friday night that we visited.  Honestly, I'm curious how well these stack up against other competing options in Phoenix. I fully intend to go on a torta hunt and find out, updating this review accordingly as needed.  For now, I give them a strong recommendation!",

I started off with their \"Bomba Con Jugo\" (OJ, Granola, Pineapple, Cantaloupe, Mango, Papaya, Strawberry, & Banana Juice). Now that's a fresh juice smoothie! After gulping this smoothie down in only a few sips, I ordered their Famous DEL REY Torta. This includes Ham, Pork Sirloin, Breaded Beef, Chorizo, and an Omelet. Toppings included Tomato, Avocado, Caramelized Onions, and a Chipotle Sauce. If you can finish this entire meal, you are fit for a King. The service was quite slow, so don't think your visit will be a quick one. I was too busy looking over their 20 page Menu that the time went by quickly for me. After hitting Los Reyes, make sure you try Respados Solaris in the same plaza! Both exceed my expectations for Mexican dining off of 7th Street.",

I got the quesadilla and I got it loaded style with stuff on top worth the extra $2.  I guess they are known for their drinks because everyone was drinking a fancy drink.   As we walked out the picture on the window said \"as seen on food network\" and  \"man v food\" so I guess this place is famous and didn't even know it! I'll definitely be back",

    "text": "When in Phoenix, it's a must to have two things- good Spanish food and good BBQ. My friend and I knocked off the first one by visiting this place as it got great reviews. We ordered the beef tongue/lengua burrito and the Del Rey torta. Believe me when I say that the portions are huge because trust me they are. I eat a lot and a mini torta was more than suffice for lunch. The only way that a regular torta would be ok would be if we shared it but there's no fun in ordering the same thing. So, why four stars and not five? Well, the lengua lacked flavor and basically needed to be coated in different salsas to be appetizing. The torta was an intense as it seemed to be- cheese egg various different kinds of meat. Personally, I liked it a lot but I think it's important to also have flavor to it versus overstuff it with as many things possible. Now, I bumped up from 3 to 4 stars because of one thing- the tres leches cake. It's huge but very light and airy at the same time so yes, one person can devour it if necessary :). All in all, I liked this place but can't say I loved it.",

I went to high school in the area and one night my dad and brother wanted to check it out (my brother is a Yelp addict and saw it had amazing reviews). I was skeptical since, driving past, it is your typical \"hole in the wall\" kind of place, but I was not disappointed at ALL. The carne asada burrito is amazing, even the salad it comes with is great. I think my favorite thing aside from that would have to be the aguas frescas, particularly the orange one...SO good. You probably will not regret ordering a single thing from this menu. I've gone back countless times, one time bringing one of my friends who was convinced that anywhere a blonde gringa tried to take her for Mexican food would be craptastic, but she loved it too.",

It's not weird.  It's not even unique.  It's a sandwich.  You put turkey on yours.  They put ham, hot dog, carne, egg, chorizo, guacamole, mayo, and pico on theirs.  Okay, maybe it's unique.  At the very least, it's better than that quesadilla you're ordering.  But go right ahead.  More torta for me!  \"SUNNYSLOPE?\"  Yes, Sunnyslope.  I don't shoot meth.  I've never picked up a hooker.  Yeah, there's a lot of Mexicans.  But I'm Mexican, so maybe I should be offended that you pointed it out.  No, it's not scary.  You don't need to lock your car door as badly as you think you do.

The torta is definitely something to share with another person.   Although the food is not better than the Mexican food I or my mom make, this is definitely the place to go for me when I don't feel like cooking my own Mexican dinner.  P.S. Try the Fresas  con Crema sold in the refrigerator behind the front counter. They are the best I have had!",

So after all that anticipation and making it there, I can tell you she was correct.  This is a great Mexican eatery that I would like!  Unfortunately not yet, I did not enjoy the juice bar.  When I ate there, I was unreasonably hungry that I ordered the most gigantic Torta I have ever seen.  The Del Rey.  Holy heart attack on a plate batman!  I imagine even weeks separated from that meal, that I am still suffering from that explosion of food that I consumed.  And it was so unbelievably delicious that I cannot imagine that I would like to find any justification to repeat that transgression again  So why the 3/5 mark.  I think a lot of the food is greasy.  I would really prefer more heart healthy food to give a rating of great / excellent.  But perhaps very authentic to Mexico.  And I also love that the food is a SUPER value.  That is HUGE.  I hated that I was served potato chips with the meal, but perhaps that is standard with a Torta?  And I wanted so bad to ask the waitress to turn the channel to NFL football - but I did have enough sense that I was in a Mexican place, surrounded by Mexican families, that probably like watching their version of football.",

I don't know why, with all the tortas on the menu, but I just seem to prefer the other menu items.  As always, the service was great, and it was very, very busy.  We had to wait to be seated.    Love this place!",

I am not exaggerating one bit when I say it was the greatest quesadilla she and I both have EVER had! I had an agua de limon to drink and it was amazing! We both had the Ranchera de Pollo Torta and it was pretty good in my opinion, she thought it was just ok. I cannot wait to go back and try more of their delicious food! I have decided that besides the amazing quesadillas and good aguas frescas this place is just average.",

    "text": "Well, right now I am sporting a very large Del Ray baby and have a huge smile on my face. I just brought home some food from  here and it was fantastic! I of course saw this place on Man V Food and had to give it a try since it was not to far from my house. This was my first time trying a Torta. I actually had no idea there was a Mexican style sandwich and I have been living in Phoenix for 42 years now. Where the hell have I been right? Well, I drove over and walked in and was pleasantly surprised. It was a very nice place. Nice and clean, the staff was very nice and helpful. The place was pretty packed and I had to stand in line for a bit to place my order. I ended up ordering a Del Ray Torta and something else I dont know the name of right now. It was a fried tortilla with beans, pork, lettuce and cheese. Both were extremely good. I had planned to take a few bites of the pork tortilla and put the rest in the fridge for tomorrow but that didnt happen. This thing was great and I ended up eating the hole damn thing. I then started in on my Torta. THIS WAS FANTASTIC!!!! If I would have known I would have started with this first. I polished off half of it pretty quickly. I then sat back and relaxed for a minute before starting in on the second half. This was the end of my partaking for the evening. I realized how incredibly full I was and I didnt think it would be a good idea trying to put anymore down there. I am now sitting here trying to type and breathe and not doing well at either.         If you try this place just make sure you remember one thing, don't order to much because you will eat EVERYTHING you order. Then you will not be able to breathe or move. But your taste buds will love you.",

Upon arrival of this beast landing in front of me i downed a tasty coca cola from the recycled bottle. My g/f ordered the torta norteno and pinapple water. the water was very good and tricked me into getting the watermelon water once that was gone. Both flavored waters very falvorful but could be server colder.   On to the tortas....The del ray was exactly what i wanted. So big i couldnt even get a solid bite out of it. All the different elements coming together to form a magical flavor party in every bite. The red and green salsas were very good too and added some spice and kick to the torta. The norteno was a simpler and less beast like torta but was very good as well and would get it next time if im not forced by hunger to order the del rey again.  Overall this place is a hidden treasure in sunnyslope and will now be on my list of go to places",

I was extremely shockingly surprised.  I did not come in to sit down and get the full on experience but some day i can promise you i will be back again to get the amazing Del ray torta. Like the past review by JT M. I am kind of glad i do not live very close to my grandma otherwise that would make me gain an extra 15-20 lbs at least probably.   Before i ordered i was seriously contemplating all these crazy items together in one sandwich trying to figure out if all these things would be good together. But i took the chance and am pleasantly happy with my decision and so is my boyfriend as well.  He would sneak bites when i brought it over to his friends and was like \"theirs a hot dog in here!\" i was like weird ya i know. But its all perfect together. I cannot wait to go back to try all the different agua frescas flavors. especially the horchata because that is my personal favorite. All i know at this time is the food is amazing and i cannot wait to go back.",

All the bragging about how big and tasty this torta is True.  I had a fabulous dinner here that was delicious, quickly served, and very affordable.  You would think that the torta would come with some tortilla chips, but no!  Instead, you get a side order of ruffles potato chips.  It's a great combination with the torta.  After a long day of playing baseball, I devoured the torta and the chips with ease.    There are a lot of interesting choices on the menu and it intrigued me.  I wish I lived closer because I would like to try other dishes.    Los Reyes de la Torta...absolutely the Kings of the Torta!",

My suggestion is go there and experience the food. I have eaten mexican food all over the west from Texas to California and all states between. This was  the best I have had. I loved the menu selections. Not just burritos, tacos, tostadas or a combination of these three. A completely new offerings of items and everything looked good. First go to their website then go. It was hard for me to rate this restaurant. The food was positively a 5. The service was a 4. Not bad service, just not as good as it gets. The store was a 4. Nothing bad just not a 5. So I gave the place a 4. If I could give a 4.5.   Go there. Eat! Enjoy. I loved the new food choices. Definitely going back.",

I knew it was some sort of Mexican drink, but I never really took the time to give it a shot, I guess my disdain for Horchata scared me off from other ethnic drinks, well...Los Reyes de la Torta made me regret my shortsightedness. After trying the Agua Frescas here, I went home and all but prayed for forgiveness from the Agua Fresca God for doubting him...this is one seriously good drink...at least at Los Reyes de la Torta it is.   This place was our back up plan for dinner last Saturday...and quickly became our first choice because our other front runner (Sonora Mesquite Grill) seemed to be inexplicably closed on Saturday evening. This ended up being a blessing though, because I can't imagine having a better Mexican meal than we did at Los Reyes de la Torta.   Right when you walk in, you know this place means business. Open kitchen, great smelling food being cooked up, 'best of' signs posted everywhere, and a packed house with people smiling and enjoying themselves wherever you look.   Upon first opening the menu, we noticed the prices...dirt cheap. Because of this we decided to get three menu items to try, along with a couple of agua frescas. Here's a breakdown of what we tried:   -Pineapple Agua Fresca - Delicious...frothy and natural tasting with each sip filled with a mouth full of mini pineapple bits.   -Lime Agua Fresca - Like a fresh squeezed lime...unbelievable refreshing.   -Asada Quesadilla - We both liked this the most out of anything we got. Fresh and tasty cheese, awesome tortilla, great tasting carne asada, and a mixture tomatoes/beans/cilantro/avacodo...melt in your mouth good.   -Cubana Torta - We are big torta fans, but had to try one here. It was good, but we weren't blown away...again, we aren't big torta fans...so take this with a grain of salt.   -Carne Asada Tacos - Okay, I know we already got a carne asada quesadilla...but we really like carne asada...so we just had to do it. The tacos were pretty good, but I wouldn't say they were spectacular. Everything in the taco tasted great but the mini tortillas they use for the tacos wasn't quite as tasty as the flour tortilla they used for the quesadilla.   ...we left stuffed and satisfied with our meal. The only possible negative thing about this place is that they don't serve chips and salsa, which is a shame. The hot sauce they bring out to your table to go with your meal would go great with some warm crunchy chips.   All in all...this place is excellent. Authentic quality Mexican food for dirt cheap, anyone in the area should definitely check it out. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff. This is a possible 5 star place, just need to go a few more times before it gets 'bumped up'.   4.25/5.",

And a river of flavor busted in my mouth I was able to polish off the full sandwich and then you also and eat a burrito enchilada this time I was very full and I call to check it was cheap as hell if  you're on a budget and you want to eat lots of food come here its fun to take a picture at the front of the store to show that you been to a Man vs food stop",

The Cuban torta was ham and cheese with Chinese BBQ pork, it was good. The burrito although small for a burrito was filled with pollo, salsa, avocados, and beans. This was pretty good except for the size, I would consider this not big enough for a meal. The pollo tacos were ok, simple enough.  But the star of the meal and unexpected winner, which in retrospect probably eclipsed the other meal components was the shrimp ceviche tostada, we got two large and they were incredible. Spicy and fresh and savory.  I could have had two of these and maybe a shrimp coctel. Well I'm assuming the shrimp coctel is wonderful also. Need to come back and try more sea food at this wonderful place.",

    "text": "Man, what I wouldn't give to be elbow deep in another Torta Del Rey right now.   We were half way through our Phoenix/Tucson Man v. Food tour before we finally made it to Los Reyes de la Torta. We arrived after the lunch rush and got seated right away. Everyone was speaking Spanish so it felt like we were in some exotic locale and not north Phoenix.   They don't serve alcohol here but my wife had the Margarita anyhow. It was so good and so was my iced tea. We ordered and tried to make conversation with the waitress but she just smiled and nodded... I really need to bone up on my Spanish.   It was a bit of a spiritual moment for me when she came back and laid that giant torta in front of me. After collecting my wits, I snapped a photo and began looking for a handhold to collect my prize. The first bite was amazing... The bun was softer than I expected and had nice charred bits for a distinct barbecue flavor. The layers of meat, cheese and veggies (the avocado was plentiful and fresh!) provided heavenly bite variety and before I knew it half was gone and I was pleasantly full.   We packed up our leftovers and wandered the restaurant for a bit before our touristy activities caught the attention of the staff. We spoke at length to a friendly staffer (seemed to have owner-like knowledge) and left feeling like a treasured guest and friend of the family.   I miss you Los Reyes de la Torta!",

They cook their food to order so it is definitely not Chipotle fast, thats what makes it so good!  Not your average run of the mill Mexican food place so don't expect the usual boring fare, expect A LOT of awesome tasting food at great prices, and they have kid friendly choices to boot!",

For beverage we had two different licuados, similar to a milkshake, but not as thick.  I ordered the pineapple and she ordered the strawberry.  We ended up swapping, as we liked the one the other ordered better.  Very yummy and would go again to try something else.",

The ranchera was even better, it had a lot of flavor for being a more simple sandwich. I would definitely come back here again....",

    "text": "My husband has been talking about this place since he saw the episode of Man Vs Food that highlighted it. It didn't seem appealing to me, so I have been putting him off.  Next time dear.  Well, relationships are about compromise my friends, so eventually I had to give in and take the boy to Los Reyes. My expectations were not high.  I mean, tortas are sandwiches right?  Why get so excited.  And so what if Adam Richman attempted to give himself a heart attach here, I'm not big on the competetive eating circiut so a sandwich the size of my head is not my cup of tea. The store front is in a run down stip mall.  It proudly dispalys a picture of Mr.Richman.  It's a little skeezy.  I prepare myself for the worst. I have an issue with calling something with no tequila a margarita, or no rum a pina coloda.  So, maybe call 'em smoothies.  I am not impressed by the menu. My husband got the La Reyna.  Now, a little background, one of our most explosive fights to date involved what he calls 'sandwich sience'.  I was packing his lunch, 'cause I'm nice like that, and he instructed me that the way I make a turkey sandwich is completely wrong.  He tried to school me in the ways of 'sandwich science' I gave him the butter knife and told him to pack his own lunch.  When my husband recieved his torta I swear to God a single tear fell down his cheek.  The cooks at Los Reyes de la Torta are certified sandwich scientists.  The way they wrapped the chorizo in the egg was probably the most beautiful sight my husband had ever seen.  His expression trumped the one he had on our wedding day as I walked down the aisle.   His silence through out the entire meal, and the fact that I never got a bite, leads me to believe that the sandwhich was not only well constructed, but very tasty.  I had the alambre de camaron.  It was shredded shrimp, onions, cheese, jalepenos, rice, beans, and tortillas.  And you know what?  I was totally wrong about this place.  Seriously.  This was so good!  Adam Richman, you did me right. Los Reyes de la Torta, thank you for a great meal!",

This is a Mexican place and they do only place Mexican TV I say this because I know some people are bothered by this.  I how ever came for the food. Waiters all speak English very clearly.  I ordered the Torta Nortena. Meat was tender with a lot of flavor. Bread was soft and kept well with all the juice.  This was amazing!! So frickin good I want to go back today!  My Mother in Law ordered a tostada \"american\" style just beans and cheese.  The owner also brought her out on that is \"mexican\" style and gave it to her for free so she could try they difference.  Very NICE!  Portions are more then enough to make you full and you will leave still wanting more. Cost is suprisingly cheap for the portions and how wonderful the taste is. Menu is full of original dishes of their own making and every item has personality.    One of my new favorite places.  I have to drive about 20 min to get there but well worth it!",

    "text": "I'm in Los Reyes de la Torta!  I'm in, Los Reyes de la Torta!  No typos there my eagle eyed friends...I am happy to report that both are (in fact) correct!  Differences without a distinction!  I was reading a thread about over-hyped places the other day, on Yelp.  I wrote something pleasant, but inane and in my haste (doing four things at the same time), I misplaced a comma!  Other sharp-eyed correspondents pointed that out to me...and I'm as grateful for the unsolicited correction as I can be!  After lamenting my typo (and the very fat fingers that I use to type these little stories), I thought to myself \"Donald, why not go to one of these very hyperbolically reviewed establishments and see if you can find that comma\"?  After all, it has to be somewhere.  So, after a busy morning, what with working, building, producing, running, meetings, making money, special \"mommy/daddy time\" with the Beautiful Carin and so much more (you know...\"the usual\"), it was off to LRDLT for a Tuesday Retox.  I met a buddy (who has here been before and raves about this place) and I was hopeful (so very hopeful) that the place would live up to the hyperbole.  I couldn't have taken that disappointment, along with losing my comma.  I needn't have worried...the Del Rey Torta was everything I could have hoped for...and much more!  The whole menu looked terrific and I noticed that the joint was completely packed (even well before the normal lunch hour got into full swing).  Everyone in the place seemed to be happy and enjoying themselves...and why not, the food is cheap and tasty...the service is pleasant and efficient...what more could I ask of lunch?  Furthermore, the aroma coming from the kitchen was heavenly (always the first indicator, for me), so I settled in and ordered the King Torta...with a diet coke.  As my lunch friend says...Sofa King good!  And Sofa King huge...certainly the portions are large enough for a small family to share (I saw multiple examples of people sharing lunches).  But I do not share...if anybody tries to grab my victuals, they're going to hear angry growling and see bared teeth.  Especially when the grits are this good!  On a happy, sunny Tuesday morning, I found that some places really do live up to the hype.  And while it isn't Keen's Chop house, or Boulevard, LRDLT is Five Stars for what it is!  Oh, after lunch...I found my misplaced comma!  \" , \"  Insert it with care!",

I mean, they strike some kind of poetic balance that resists duplication. The sandwiches have a variety of toppings and fillings, and are served on a beautiful bolillo roll. I'm partial to the milanesa (breaded chicken or beef). There's something about the mild crunch of the filling that combines with the smoothness of the avocado and the kick of the jalapeno. Fantastic.  Los reyes also deliver on the beverage front. The make their own fresh juice, so there are quite a few options for aguas frescas, licuados, etc. One thing worth trying is the vampiro: orange, carrot, celery, beet, and pineapple juices. The vampiro will probably cure the most intractable ailment.  The restaurant is also bustling and fun. Servers are friendly and multi-lingual. If you live in Sunnyslope, check the place out immediately. If not, it's worth a trip!",

    "text": "Yet another place I would never have found without Christina P and Yelp!  And it was good.  Really good!  The menu has quite a few recognizable items like burros and tacos, but I opted to try a huarache, basically an over-sized tostada with a thicker, softer corn tortilla and you choose your toppings.  Let's just say it's 8:16 am and I wish I were eating one right now.    They don't serve alcohol, but they do have a great juice bar with many options to choose from.  Of course, that won't satisfy anyone who can't fathom the idea of a spicy meal without a beer or margarita.  But it worked for me.  I will definitely come back if I'm in the neighborhood.  I just need to find a reason to be in the neighborhood now.",

It is a good things I do not live in Phoenix or I would gain about 50lbs on these tortas alone.

Add a Coke from the glass bottle, you know the kind of coke that is made with sugar cane and NOT corn syrup, let's just say it's pure heaven in my belly.  Agua Frescas are delicious as well.  Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Mango, taste like your drinking the fruit itself.  So refreshing and light.  Don't forget the shrimp ceviche especial, at .99 cents, you will want about 10 more of these... will take a picture next time I go. The only downsides, they serve potato chips instead of tortilla chips.  No alchohol, but trust, once you bite into one of these filling sandwiches, those two faults are easily forgivable if not forgotten.",

    "text": "JD invades AZ Day 2:  While researching places to eat on my AZ vacation,  I came across the \"Man vs Food\" episode where he visits this exact Los Reyes De La Torta (LRT). I was really curious, but a bit hesitant especially after that whole Mexico Bakery (MB) debacle (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/mexico-bakery-san-jose-2?hrid=D-vOUl2zj5fBOhbOBHRFjg\">yelp.com/biz/mexico-bake...</a>) --but I sacked up; grabbed my brother-in-law (BIL); headed over there; and ordered two of their infamous Torta Del Rey to-go.  Torta Del Ray- This thing is a beast and makes the massive Torta at MB look like a midget. They really should call it the \"Regadero De La Cocina Torta\" (aka Kitchen Sink) because it's got everything you could imagine--and then some! There's Ham, Pork Loin, Beef Milanese, Hot Dog, Chorizo, melted cheese, Queso Fresco, Chipotle Salsa, Omelet, Tomato, Onions, Avocado, and Chipotle sauce. *Whew!* Now that's a mouthful, both literally and figuratively--and to top it all off they give you a handful of Ruffles chips (in case the Torta isn't enough food for you). The Torta itself was pretty good; I think I'm finding out that I'm not a fan of too much stuff on my sandwiches. I think the taste of everything gets muddled up in there and you get some serious mouth confusion. On the plus side, I really liked their Red Salsa; it went great on the Torta and the Ruffles. If I ever go back I'm definitely ordering one of their simpler Tortas. 3.5*  Horchata- I liked LRT's Horchata; it had a good flavor without the chalkiness that you can sometimes find. 4*  Service & Ambiance- We ordered our Tortas to-go so we didn't experience the wait-staff, but the two people at the front where we placed our order were very nice and friendly. LRT is located in a pretty Ghetto-Fabulous section of Phoenix; upon our first arrival we were greeted by two borrachos chilling in the lot and a couple of other suspicious characters just \"hanging out\". I'm not sure if I'd pay LRT a visit at night, but during the daytime I think it just adds to the experience. 4*  Value- While $9.75 is a hefty price to pay for a sandwich, realistically you can easily share this with at least one other person. 3*   Admittedly, it was a little contrived to seek this place out because I had seen it on a TV show, it was definitely fun to do once. If I lived in the area I seriously doubt I'd make the Torta Del Ray a regular item in my rotation. However, I can almost guarantee that their other more reasonably-sized Tortas would be much better. I'm gonna try to stop in one more time before I head out of town, but until then LRT gets a thumbs up.",

It's a little on the greasy side, but as much as one might expect from a local favorite Mexican food restaurant.   The place is on a crappy-looking strip mall with limited parking. It's not very good looking and the dining area feels slightly cramped. However, the service and food make up for it. I highly recommend!!",

Came here with my boyfriend this past Sunday afternoon after seeing all of the awesome Yelp reviews and it did not disappoint.  The place was PACKED and we waited about 20 minutes for a table.  No biggie.  I'll wait for good food.  We were seated and ordered two agua frescas (one strawberry (for him) and a watermelon (for me)) along with two of their famous tortas.  About 20 minutes later our drinks and food came out together.  I wish the drinks came out sooner (I was thirsty), but again, the place was packed and the boyfriend and I were engaged in conversation anyway.   Tortas?  Bomb!  Agua Frescas?  Bomb!  Definitely a fork and knife kind of sandwich (it's huge!).  I preferred my watermelon agua fresca to his strawberry, but they were both yumm-o. The boyfriend couldn't say enough good things about his torta (he'd never had one)  and I was so pleased to know that I had found the amazing Mexican restaurant I had been searching for since relocating to Phoenix in July.  I'm still perplexed as to why there is such a lack of decent Mexican food here! The menu is diverse and carries many other items besides tortas so check it out.  Also, Adam Richman from Man vs Food came here to film a food challenge episode.  You'll immediately know by the wall sized photos of him strewn throughout the restaurant.  Bring your peeps and an appetite and you won't leave hungry or disappointed.  I can't wait to come back and try more stuff!",

    "text": "At first I missed it since its in this teeny strip mall type thing south of Hatcher. The little parking lot was full so I decided to chance the Wireless Phone store next door, parking at the end, completly ignoring the tow away zone. Living on the dangerous side - that's me! LOL  When I walked in, it was PACKED. Sunday 300pm, guess everyone came in after church. I was quickly greeted by a waitress and asked for here or to go. I ordered out and got the Alambre De Res. I asked her how many tacos come in it and was told an order of three. Only when I got home to find two corn tortillas hiding under the mound of beef. Anyway, as I was standing there to pay, another waitress was handing over these two fruit things, the nosey person I am quickly asked what is that because it looked delicious. She called it a Fruit with Whip Cream, apparently it had sour cream and pecans in it to. So I ordered the Strawberry one as well.  As it was just to crowded for me, I stepped out side, eating my Fruit Cream and waited for my order to appear. I was told it would take 10-15mins which I was fine with because of the crowd it was understandable. After about 5mins I realized it started to get hot and I stepped back inside and grabbed a seat and proceeded to people watch.  There was one waitress who's sole purpose was to answer the phone, taking to go orders and packing them up as they were ready. Another one stood at the cash register and accepted all payments. I saw a man there not dressed in the pink shirt and khaki pants, perhaps the Manager? He would talk with the waiteresses, pointing out things that they quickly addressed. Just made sure everything was running smoothly.  As I waited, I munched on the Fruit Cup - delicious! It had chunks of strawberries and pieces of pecans. Almost like yogurt. When I finally got my order home, and opened the box it just looked delicious...only missing one corn toritlla. What I liked about the meal is that it had a huge wedge of grilled onion and chili, so I could take a bite of that with the tacos. Grilled veggies are the best! The \"salad\" I didn't bother with, I think it was shredded lettuce, could've been cabbage, but since I didn't touch it, I'm not sure. Beans would've been a better side. I munched on the slices of cucumber and radishes that accompanied it. The meat was delicious with the melted cheese on top and with the salsa - a delicious meal it made!  Oh. And all these reviews about it being a sketchy/scary area. Umm..not really..  6/1/14 Update: This visit I got the Mexican Pizza in the appetizer section - delicious! I also got the Alambre De Cameron (Shrimp Tacos) SO GOOD! Filled with shrimp, topped with melting cheese. I didn't want the \"salad\" that usually comes with it and asked for beans instead. Welll...they gave me double serving of rice. BUT! It wasn't the typical Spanish Rice that I do NOT under any circumstances like. It had corn, bell peppers and NO hint of tomato sauce anywhere. YUM!",

I'd like to think I'm a bit of a foodie and was quite pleased to find this restaurant packed and quite renown (thanks, Adam Richman!). There was a wait at around 1:30pm on a Sat, but we asked if we could sit at this one small 2 person table by the kitchen (which was empty) and they let us. We quickly ordered with the help of our friendly waitress, and got these amazing agua frescas (pineapple - YUM!) on top of a pretty authentic meal (see pic). The prices were super affordable, the service fast, and we left very full and happy.",

    "text": "We used to come here to Los Reyes De La Totra weekly. We all enjoyed the food. And one of my friends was a picky eater and he liked it here a lot. My friends always ordered various meat dishes tacos and enchiladas and one would get the steak. Everyone was satisfied and. Finished their meal with a smile. I would order the sopes usually 2. I would get mines vegan. Hmm they were ok. Not outstanding and not terrible either. The reason I was not loving them was because they didn't put hardly any thing on them............ Just beans and lettuce. Would have been more enjoyable if they gave them some love. Tomatoes, avocados, chillies. But no just lettuce and beans .  At least the flavour was good (hand made fresh) not deep fried. Then after going there for several months; they revamped the menu and it included a plate for vegetarians. Which included nopales, beans and I think also a tostada. And I would at times order this and at times get my sopes.  Ahh before I forget...these sopes were not your traditional  small tea cup plate size.......no no;  they were big about the size of a small dinner plate. Also they didn't have the folded in edge like a traditional sope has. These were flat and thick.   Salsas were always good. And if you needed more they would bring you more no charge ah they serve corn chips and salsa no charge. Which is a nice touch especially if your hungry. Gives you some thing to munch on before you get your meal.  All the staff here at Los  Reyes De La Totra. Were all always very friendly, personable and helpful. This is one place I sincerly do miss.",

    "text": "One thing I missed having after living in Iowa is good Mexican food. Finding Mexican cuisine in rural Iowa wasn't difficult, but the range of ingredients, freshness, and flavor often fell short of expectations. On the first visit, I came with fellow Yelpers Angela T, Fia R, and Kurdy S. More recently, I introduced my aunt to this place when she came to visit me. There's plenty of parking in the strip mall. Lighting isn't the best, and the hole in the wall decor consists of tiled floors, large open kitchen, TVs, and a down to earth vibe.   The first thing interested diners need to know is their specialization in tortas. These gigantic subs are known for their size that probably weighs more than 5 pounds. The Del Rey ($9.50) came fully stacked with ham, cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, refried beans, two hot dogs, chorizo, eggs, tomato, onion, avocado, chipotle sauce, and a plate full of potato chips. There seemed to be no end to this sandwich, as I couldn't even finish half of it. In terms of quality, I liked the overall composition, the soft toasted bread, and the apparent shock effect for the amount of calories this beast carries. However, the refried beans could be more evenly spread, and the breaded beef could be seasoned so it has flavor. It was an item fun to have in group situations, and a novelty to cross off my long and never-ending to-eat list.  The Nopales con Asada ($10.99) came with thick slices of grilled beef, cactus, fresh cheese, guacamole, and my choice of flour tortillas. The beef was juicy, fully marbled, chewy, and flavorful. The cactus was a highlight too, but was slightly over-salted. Food again was plentiful. I couldn't finish it all and had to take the rest to go. I'm likely order this again.  The Chilaquiles ($7) came with fried tortilla, cotija cheese, runny eggs, onions, sour cream, and green and red salsa. The combination was delicious, particularly with the thick runny egg yolks to finesse the crispy textures and sharp salsa. The mix of flavors was still not as excellent as the Chiaquiles at Anepalco's, but it is a dish I would recommend besides the torta.   The Pollo Burro ($6.75) came with chunky chicken, refried beans, pico de gallo, cheese, and avocado. The texture was too wet and mushy. El Farolito has a better burrito, where each ingredient is discernible and better seasoned. I don't recommend it.  Another item I would not recommend is the Cocktel de Camaron Chico ($10.99). It came with shrimp, tomato juice, cilantro, onions, and avocado. The ratio was off as the few shrimps were lost in the tomato juice. The support cast could come chunkier as fillers. I felt like I had gone fishing only to come up empty with a few tiny shrimps. Overpriced and it was awful.  These meals would not be complete unless I hit the 10,000 calories mark. So, for dessert, I highly recommend getting the Chocoflan ($5). It's a custard cake, not too sweet, very moist, and rich in chocolate flavor. It was addictive and easy to finish.   For drinks, I liked the Aguas Frescas Naturales ($3.50). I preferred the watermelon flavor to the cantaloupe, and the non-alcoholic King Margarita ($4.50) was also worth considering as it comes with fresh strawberries with a touch of salt in every sip.  The food took some time to arrive at our table and service was very absent unless we flag down someone to help us. Overall, I thought this restaurant offers a good variety of dishes, and portions were consistently out of this world. However, I have also had better and cheaper Mexican food elsewhere. I would consider this a good place to bring out of town guests looking for hole in the wall experiences. 3.5 stars for both visits, I'd be interested in coming back.",

Our server was not only helpful and fast but she was also extremely courteous and professional.

There is a vast variety to choose from. These tortas are not your typical asada tortas you get in other places. The meats are very well cooked and they are served plenty. For all of you that don't like spicy just ask them to omit the chipotle sauce, since it is a little spicy. We will definitely come back another chance we get to travel to Arizona.",

We thought we were being so smart by sharing two items.  Yeah, right.  There was enough deliciousness to feed a small family.  Mango juice... served in a chalice with a big slice o' mango riding on the side.  Shrimp quesadilla... I had no idea that tortillas could be made in that size.  Torta Del Rey... Easily more than 5\" tall and packed with just about everyting that their kitchen can prepare.  I would love to see someone try to bite into this.  We had to eat it with a fork.  Amusing that the torta is served with potato chips - who has the stomach real estate left to eat those!?  The only thing you can do after a meal like that is crash on the nearest couch until you feel human again.  I will be hungry again sometime late next week.  Ay, lo me Encanta!",

The USA torta was good too.   Our waitress was very friendly. Always smiling and making aure we were doing good.   Boo-hoo no beer is sold but its not a big deal, get an  agua fresca or a liquado instead, those are great as well!  Overall you have to appreciate this place for what it is, a local torta restaurant, well worth the trip!",

    "text": "I love this place! I moved here from Anaheim CA about two years ago and I was having a horrible experience finding a Mexican or torta or taco place because most Mexican places I went here in Phoenix is \"Sonoran\"  or \"northern\" style cuisine. They make tortas just like the ones in the D.F. city or Cuernavaca Morelos!!! In addition they have Esquimos, which I love (it's a drink) so I've been coming to place at least once a month. It is in a small location parking and wait time is horrible, but we'll worth the wait, that's why I put 4 abd not 5, they NEED a bigger location.  The outside is not very attractive, I almost didn't go in, there's usually a waiting time to be seated. They make the food fresh so it also takes a while. Do not go when your starving because, it does take time! They also gave a \"kids menu\" the portions on those are a bit big in my 4yr niece only eats 1/4 to 1/2. The tortas comes with \"chips\" aka ruffle looking salted potato chips like regular lays, or a salad consisting of lettuce and a couple of cucumber slides. I loved that this they served the salad with cut lime, ( just like my mother, they must be from the same place) no dressing so I don't have to worry about telling \"NO DRESSING\". If you do go, try one of their delicious natural fruit water, they also have fresh juices.",

Bc this was seriously nast. We ordered the queso w chorizo and that was bomb, I'll give them that.  Our food came out, I had one bite of my chilaquiles and was like ready to spit it out. The green sauce was creepy and the steak was very off in flavor and not seasoned at all. I asked for a to go box and boxed up the steak to feed my dogs.   My friend ordered their torta. She was like 'I can't tell if I don't like this bc it's gross or bc I'm full' I tasted it and was like 'bc it's gross.' she called me today to tell me she tried eating it for breakfast but threw it out bc it was nasty.   We'll be sticking to the torta from Gallo Blanco, bc even though their service sucks, at least their torta is amazeballs.   Seriously some of the grossest food I've tasted. The staff was friendly and the place was clean and packed. I just personally find the food super nasty.",

    "text": "We went to Los Reyes de la Torta last weekend for the first time. I was excited about the food, but wondered if it would be difficult to order and about the standards of cleanliness.   Both concerns were completely unfounded. The staff there were English-speaking and very friendly. The place appeared to be quite clean, too!   We ordered two agua frescas. One was mango and the other was cantaloupe/watermelon on the waitress' recommendation. Wow! Both were so fresh and delicious. Not too sweet, either.   Our sandwiches were the del Rey and the Arizona. They were both huge and served on some really good sandwich buns. I just couldn't believe my eyes when I saw all the stuff they squeezed into both sandwiches! Ham, pork sirloin, chorizo, sausage, egg, avocado, jalapenos, breaded beef-- probably some things I'm forgetting.   Somehow the flavors meld together to create the most savory combination with just a little heat. I had to stop after eating half my sammy due to threat of gastric explosion. Hubby ate the entire del Rey. Guess skinny guys must have a hollow leg where they put giant meals.   I loved my meal. It's the kind of thing you'd see on \"thisiswhyyourefat.com\" but soooooo worth it. We will be going back and plan to blow our out-of-town guests' minds with this place next time they visit! I forgot to mention our meal was less than $30 including tip.",

The sandwiches didn't take long after we ordered, but the few minutes we had waiting at our table were filled with sweet horchata and Marc Anthony music videos.   When the food came, I could only manage to make it halfway through the Torta Nortena, which is a sandwich stuffed with thinly sliced beef, grilled onions, tomato, jalapenos, chipotle mayo, bubbly cheese and fresh avocado. It's a hot mess... and so good you'll WANT to get your hands (and your shirt/pants/neighbor) dirty.  My boyfriend ordered a shrimp ceviche tostada (very tasty) and the Torta de la Reyna, which was enormous and came with everything mine did... plus a zillion other things like chorizo, ham, what looked like a whole omelet, etc.   We used the Yelp app a lot while we were traveling, which is great when you're looking for something like \"cheap Mexican food\" because it brings you to neighborhoods you wouldn't normally check out while visiting. This is how we found Los Reyes de la Torta. I'm sure there are plenty of tourists flocking here after the Man vs. Food shout-out (we didn't know 'til we arrived), but it didn't feel the least bit touristy and I I liked that.",

After I convinced my 10year old that she might actually enjoy the unfamiliar (and get a fresh fruity drink), we stopped in at Los Reyes de la Torta for lunch.  We were seated quickly and a friendly young lady waited on us.  We needed a minute to look over the large selection of items, so she brought us water and gave us a couple minutes.  My daughter wouldn't order a torta, but said she'd try mine.  She selected a quesedilla with guac, and a Mango/Strawberry Aguas Cremosas, which is kinda like a lighter milk shake- not as heavy on the cream. The white cheese was melted and folded between a deliciously buttered and grilled flour tortilla.  Yum!  She enjoyed it, and the drink.  Based upon Rand's review, I ordered the \"Torta Nortena\" with salad.  Iced tea is fresh brewed and good.  The food arrived quickly and was plated beautifully.  This was truly the best Torta I have ever had.  The mix of ingredients was just right, and the bread was divine.  It was a little spicy for my daughter, but she loved the mix of flavors and suggested that the entire family come back for lunch next Saturday.    Servings are larges, so we took home 1/2 a Torta and a bunch of quesedilla, which were quickly consumed by a perpetually hungry teen, who now wants to go get her own Torta.  We enjoyed the atmosphere- lots of families, bustling and lots of energy.  Positive, happy crowd.  The restaurant is in an old-school strip center, but is clean and effort has been made to make the inside cheerful.  We watched some of the prep cooks working and I noted that they used proper safety/sanitation measures at all times.    I can't wait to go back and try some other variations.  My daughter is now a Torta convert.",

We were both really hungry as we hadn't ate all day and it was a good thing because I didn't even finish my plate.    I ordered the cantaloupe agua fresca and the tinga quesadilla.  The agua fresca was awesome full of flavor and even a very nice presentation.  I am a huge fan of chicken tinga so anyplace that serves it gets an A in my book.  This place is another perfect example of that.  The quesadilla  was awesome lots of meat inside along with a great sauce and cheese on the top.    This place rocks and I will be back for sure.  Laura even made the comment this is the first place she has ate at that makes her feel like back home in Mexico flavorwise.",

The Mexicana, carne asada torta, had fresh bread, good mix of avocados and sides making this a great mexican sandwich.  The carne asada was good.  The Pierna, pork loin tacos, were moist and just right.  Good amount of toppings and the salsa was a good addition to the street style tacos.

    "text": "Holy crap, these are massive sandwiches.  On the recommendation of my boss (who very obviously saw this on Man vs Food, despite his denials), I made my way over to this place to try one of their tortas.  The bread is fantastic.  Light, super soft, hearty enough to hold the sandwich together, crusty enough to give you a nice grip, while it doesn't bring much in flavor or texture, it absorbs so much of the flavors of the ingredients.  Usually a negative for me when the bread doesn't serve a bigger role, but when there is so much going on otherwise, I'll make an exception here.  I love the breaded beef.  The meat is super tender and there's a lot of flavor coming from either the breading or the beef (can't tell).  Also, the mexican sausage (not sure if it's just the chorizo) is good spicy.  In the portions they use relative to everything else, it balances out, but you get these nuggets of real heat - much appreciated.  I do wish the house guacamole had a bit more heat it to it, because as is, it acts more as a palette cooler.  Also... fried egg on a sandwich - not new, but  there's something super breakfasty about it in these tortas.  Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but there was a nagging feeling that I was eating breakfast.  Not that there's anything wrong with breakfast for lunch or dinner.  Ambiance inside is very casual and relaxed.  Wait staff weren't the friendliest and I often felt like I was waiting for them to finish their personal conversations.  Food came up fast.  Already looking forward to many future visits and many future tortas.",

Seated right away by a beautifully sweet hostess who was super kind and helpful. The server was sweet and gave her recommendations. Took care of the refills and checked back often. We ordered a side of grilled shrimp (my kid loves shrimp) 12 shrimp for $5.50, that's a great price. A kids quesadilla with rice and beans (the beans were cold and the cheese on top was barely melted but had good flavor, the rice was okay and the quesadilla, well it's a tortilla with melted cheese, can't go wrong). Ordered a bean and cheese burrito with chips (choice of salad or chips with burros) The chips were Ruffles lol. Also ordered the Bistec Burro enchilada style with Red sauce( delicious steak and filled to the max, the red sauce was so good too, my only complaint was it wasn't very hot, barely warm, I want HOT food! Temperature hot) and finally tried the Rachero Torta with chicken (it was good but nothing special, although the guacamole was darn good) Overall, I would definitely eat here again and stick to the Burros, HUGE and delicious and maybe ask them to heat it up more. Good service and huge menu!",

However, I feel that Los Reyes rides on their fame of Man vs Food albiet their torta portions are massive. Nothing here was spectacular to me.  I ordered the Del Rey Torta, from the rave reviews and I do tend to get signature items from restaurants since it should be a representation of who they are. Along with the torta I ordered a horchata.  The Del Rey is a massive torta that easily feeds 2, a half for each person. It comes with a side of chips and in the torta itself it has: avocado, pickled onions, tomato, egg encasing chorizo, hotdog, then cheese, brisket, and fried steak. Bread barely held every thing in and was a huge mess.  The torta had lots of textures, flavor wasn't as flavorful and didn't seem to be cohesive. It was just a lot of meat, cooked different ways in between two slices of bread. The chorizo didn't have that lovely red color nor heat to it.  The horchata was plain chalky, powdering and doused in cinnamon powder on top.  I packed half of my torta home since I couldn't finish my meal, but didn't even end up eating it afterwards. I didn't finish my horchata.  Service is decent. Typical of a family run restaurant, casual but timely. Pricing was okay for what it was, though I would get Mexican food elsewhere.",

    "text": "Los Reyes De La Torta  This locally owned family restaurant serves up very authentic mexican food.  They are famous for their tortas and in particular the \"Del Rey\" which consists of - Ham, melted cheese, pork sirloin, breaded beef, sausage, chorizo and eggs with tomato, onions, jalapeno and avocado. This beast is about 8 inches tall and can barely bite into it. All the different items blend well with each other for $8.99  The Del Rey was featured in Man vs Food and is their staple but other items are very good also.  King Carlos V is the double version of the Del Rey and is brought out on a pallet for $19.99.  The tacos and burritos are also tasty and you will not leave feeling hungry.   We also have had the Mexican drinks aqua fresca which comes in a variety of flavors and which you can't go wrong.  But if you go here the tortas are what you come here for.",

Tostada came out within minutes and was perfection.  Cold, clean, fresh ceviche which was a perfect snack.  Torta came out piping hot and fresh.  Added some salsa and chopped jalapenos and it was perfection in my opinion.  Just a nice clean spicy torta.  Bill was $9 plus tip.    Highly recommend anytime",

The blend of spice, acidity, sweet, and sour turns the food at Los Reyes into works of art for the mouth. I have NEVER had Tortas that taste so flavorful and I've been around authentic Mexican food for over 30 years.   How I miss you!...",

I ordered a carne asada Torta, and was very disappointed by what they brought out. I've had other tortas at taco trucks that had better flavor. The torta they brought out was pretty much just carne asada they had cooked earlier that day and just cut it into half's. Smh not even fresh and it was cold. Overpriced Mexican food which shouldn't even be called Mexican food. Customer service was ok but it doesn't make up for the crappy food, and don't even get me started on the price of a torta it's laughable. Just because you're Location you put a bigger price on everything. I sincerely do not recommend if this place if you want authentic tortas and would really suggest changing the name of this place because they are not \"Los Reyes de la Torta",

We started with the tostada de ceviche and the tostada de tinga with guacamole- perfect . Next was Torta del principe and huaraches con tingo de pollo with grilled cactus . Portions are very big . The dinner was outstanding...the meat had great flavor . The torta came with a raw vegetable side and grilled onion/jalapeno. The cactus reminded me of string beans with more flavor . The table hot sauce was great and they also brought out a Verde sauce and a roja sauce - both awesome! Also ordered a horchata- yummy !   No alcohol served . Didn't try dessert but they sounded good . This restaurant beats out all of the uppity Mexican fusion/artisan/hipster/wannabe authentic places at triple the price . It's the real deal !",

My blank stare must have communicated my intent; I was handed a menu as I was asked \"to-go?\"  Yes, that.   I moved away from Phoenix a few years ago and Austin doesn't have a decent torta place to its name. My usual go-to was on Arizona avenue, but I didn't feel like fighting the 51 this afternoon. So here I come Reyes!  My Arizona torta only took a few minutes to come out and I must have inhaled it back at my hotel. It was packed with meat, tomato, avocado, jalapeno...all the good things in life. I poured on the provided green salsa and went to town. It was 1pm and I didn't eat for the rest of the day. Couldn't! For fear of my stomach bursting. Good, filling, indulgent - everything I need in a torta.",

I ordered a ceviche appetizer; this was the best ceviche I've ever had -- I would come here just for this! For my entree, I had the bistecas y huevos with rice and beans; it came with sides of avocado and Mexican cheese. I also had a refreshing glass of mango agua fresca which accompanied the meal perfectly.

My torta de milanesa had beans and no-where else have I ever had beans in a torta, atleast never in Mexico, place where the torta is king. But this might just be a filling replacing the standard avocado added to tortas de milanesa. Since I noticed that my torta lacked that and the avocado always gives it that extra creamy and tasty kick!!          Also, my standards are high for tortas. I've been lucky enough to enjoy tortas de Milanesa and Cubanas in Currnavaca and Mexico City by Tortas Che and others there!! Those are bomb!!! ANYWAYS!!          The tortas here are not bad, their simply good, but nothing that I would frequent nor crave. The service here was fantastic!!!! No complaints there, we were getting attention left and right, nothing overwhelming, just accommodating and super attentive.         The ONE THING I did love from this place was the Fresas con Crema!! Those were AMAZING!!! That is the reason why I came here in the first place. One of my friends had these exact Fresas con Crema at his place and he shared some with me to try and the Fresas con Crema and I fell in love ever since!!  OH YOU SWEET, SWEET, FRESAS CON CREMA with pieces of pecans!! :) You rock my taste buds!! :)       Yours truly,            Lizeth M. :)",

    "text": "Ok, you want quick and amazing food that takes you to your childhood, even if you're not Mexican? Reyes de la Torta will do it.   I had always heard about this place from the youth I worked with. They said it was amazing. Once I went, I was hooked.   You're going to get a completely different feel from this place. Yeah, it's in a strip mall; yeah, the hostess may stick you and your party at a table smaller than you're accustomed to; Yeah, there is soccer playing on the TVs instead of the news; .. but the food will make you not care about any of those things. Plus, they are always playing Salsa, not loud or rambunctious, trumpet-filled music. This adds to the experience as it makes me feel like I may be somewhere resembling my homeland of Colombia.   When you're asked for your drink order, make sure you ask for one of their aguas frescas... translation: fresh juice. I always get the Agua Fresca de Limon. It reminds me of the limeade I drink when I am back home in Colombia - this drink makes the whole experience worth it.  The chips and salsa are good, although you might want to watch out with the salsa if you're not a spice fan.   Ok, the restaurant is named the king of the tortas ... and you ask what is a torta?? To Mexican people, a torta is sandwich of meat, vegetables and anything else they may throw on there made on a hamburger-style bun - and that is what they're famous for -  that is why Adam from Man vs Food went there. But, I have never had their tortas simply because at Reyes you will enter a homemade-tortilla heaven that is like nothing else. These tortillas are amazing, from their texture, to their slight greasiness, to their taste, they are the best tortillas I have ever had.   So, in order to continue to eat the best tortillas ever, I always get the chicken quesadilla. Yep, it's simple, but amazing. You can also choose to get it \"Estilo del Rey\" which means they top off your quesadilla with more cheese ( white cheese, not crappy, yellow, greasy cheese), sour cream and green onions. That in itself sends this quesadilla into the history books.   Do yourself a favor and check out a truly unique restaurant tucked away in a strip mall just south of Hatcher on 7th Street. Make your way up to Sunnyslope and see what the buzz is about.",

Unfortunately, I did not have the stomach space to partake in the del rey, but I was able to enjoy the milanesa and a giant agua fresca.  My milanesa was great - loved the fresh bread and the thinly battered beef. I forgot what the bf had, but his was even better because it was more saucey. Beware of the free salsa because they are both SPICY!!  I think even better than the torta was the agua fresca. I had the fresa cremosa - strawberry milk and it was amazing! Oh yeah and they have Mexican cokes in bottles too.   The parking lot is a bit small, but there was a guy guiding people on where to park. He was really nice and told us not to park in the neighboring lot or we would get towed.",

I must have made the wrong choice in torta because it was pretty boring - the meat wasn't really seasoned, the avocado was just lumped on instead of spread evenly, and there were no beans like the menu says. I got it without jalapeno so maybe that would have made the difference but overall, I was pretty disappointed. Also, it was just the torta (only slightly larger than your average fast food burger) and a side of radish and cucumbers (???) that I didn't want and some cabbage/lettuce mix I put on my burger myself for over $7.  However, the agua frescas was DELICIOUS.  I would come back and try to make a better choice but overall, a pretty disappointing experience that left me unsatisfied and $12.50 poorer.

    "text": "Does \"Los Reyes de la Torta\" translate to \"gut bomb?\" Because that's what I got there. The food tasted good but man, did my stomach not like me for it.  The boyfriend and I ordered the mushroom queso and a torta to share (these things are huge). I would not order the queso again. I guess we just didn't know what it was. We expected a queso dip for chips. We got a plate full of melted cheese that I guess you put into tortillas. It was difficult to manage and just not really what we wanted.  The torta was tasty, I'll give 'em that. But honestly, it could have been better. We got one with pineapple and chipotle mayo. Could have used more of both. The mayo was almost non-existent. But there was plenty of meat so even though we shared one torta we were more than stuffed walking out of there.   I would give it another shot but only if I was really, really hungry.",

It sounds terrible, I know, but it was my fault for eating too much. There were way too many things on the menu that I wanted to try so I ended up getting the Del Rey. That sandwich is F-ing loaded! I mean, I'm all about excess sometimes with my food, but this thing has almost everything that you could want from a Mexican joint overflowing in between two halves of bread. Ya only live once though so I went for it, and it was very delicious! I've seen a similar torta on No Reservations in Frisco, but never knew that there was one in the valley. I'm glad I got to try it! Now, because of Man vs Food, most people will only go for the Del Rey. I would like to vouch for the quesadillas there though; they were also excellent! Their salsas are great as well, I just wish they had tortilla chips to go with em! Oh, and did I mention the agua frescas?! Amazing!   It's a great little spot and I'm very glad that a tv show can help out local businesses the way that it does. I'm going to be moving a lot closer to Los Reyes, so I'll probably be in there more often in months to come.",

    "text": "I was a little skeptical when a coworker followed our bosses recommendation of  this place for lunch last week; what does a suit know about Mexican food?   Our party of 3 arrived at 1145, a tricky time for Friday lunch. We were promptly seated to a clean table and I noticed the other tables were also getting cleaned quickly. Having worked in the industry for several years, I notice this sort of stuff and appreciate a quickly bussed dining room.   Most of the staff are Spanish speaking but my gringo lunch pals had no problem getting by with their Spanglish and innocent, pleading looks.   I scanned the menu and quickly spotted the \"home make corn tortillas\" for the quesadillas. I asked the server and she confirmed that this was only for the Estilo del Rey quesadillas. I'm a sucker for anything made in house- sign me up! She also guided me away from the pork and told me to get the chicken because it was better. I love having an interaction with someone who actually knows what they're talking about, so much better than a doe-eyed or aloof server saying \"everything is good\".   When my plate arrived, I was really impressed with the presentation. The quesadilla took up half the plate, it was drizzled with crema, sprinkled with queso fresco, fresh cilantro and diced onion. It was served with a side of shredded iceberg and some lime wedges. I'm a firm believer in meaningful condiments, so if it comes with wedges dammit I'm using all of them.   I juiced the limes and went to town. The steaming hot shredded chicken was perfectly cooked, sauteed with onions, spices and dressed with just the right amount of red chili. Slight warning- this is a little spicy but I would rate it close to a Valentino or Cholula-level.   Coworker #1 got the Asada plate; the meat was bland and the beans were a little too creamy for my liking.  I quickly apologized to my quesadilla for straying.  Coworker #2 is a fellow foodie and had the shrimp tacos.  She was protecting her plate like a mother bear over a cub so I knew better and thought, \"next time\".   I've since been back and tried desperately to look at something else on the menu but the chicken quesadilla Estilo del Rey kept beckoning to me.  Soon my love, we will reunite...  oh- and the suit got mad street cred...",

Anyway, I came all the way from Chandler to N. Phx to try this place.   I was expecting a more quieter atmosphere at the time but they were blasting the soccer game. Also chips and salsa are not provided.   The menu has a lot to choose from, I was soo undecided. However, I came here for the Torta del Rey, so thus that is what I ordered. I want to try to carne asada next time. Anyway, I knew it was going to be a huge sandwich. Lo and behold it was presented to me and all I did was gasp. WOW! It was a sandwich plus potato chips as a side (weird).  Let me remind you I am a nutrition student, this is far from healthy....ham, cheese, egg, chorizo, pork strips, etc.  Great tasting sandwich, but I much preferred it with the green sauce they provided. I downed that first half in no time, but I could no conquer the whole sandwich.   Great big sandwich for $9, not bad. Considering I could enjoy the other half later on. I would definitely go back to try the other menu items.",

I liked that there was a slight bit of heat, not enough to send one running for water and not too little that one would want to douse their tortas with hot sauce. Their tortas are served with a side of potato chips. The tortas are a good size. I can finish a whole one when I'm starved, but otherwise, I take half and save it for later since the serving size was a bit much for me. Next time, I totally need to get some sopes since i have yet to find a good place yet and need to check out their Lengua torta. I have to also mention their aguas cremosas, which are delish; it's a yummy drink/dessert. Also, the staff was nice, the prices were good and its a clean lil place.",

I googled \"hole in the wall Mexican restaurant\" but despite the rough neighborhood, Los Reyes is very nice inside.  It is clean and cozy and although I'm a \"clean freak\" I wasn't scared to eat here at all!    We had lengua tacos, cabeza tacos, and pollo tacos - everyone thought they were delicous (especially the corn tortillas)!  We also tried the shrimp ceviche tostada appetizers for .99 which was a great value and very tasty.  My daughter had the strawberry iced drink and the cheese quesadilla and she loved them both.  Usually quesadillas are greasy or dry and this wasn't either, it was really good.  We can't wait to come back here and try some tortas, the chicken salad - which looked delicious, and we'll try to save room for some of the amazing looking fruit salad.  Oh yeah and the taco prices were outstanding -- $6 for a big plate of 3 tacos and a \"salad\" which was lettuce, radishes, cucumbers, grilled onion and jalapeno.  What a gem...",

My personal favorite is the milanesa it just reminds me of my childhood eating breaded steak almost every night for dinner. They use great quality ingredients and they dont skimp out on them and thats what makes this place so great!  Their drinks are awesome too! The agua de fresas is the best thing ever! its so refreshing and tasty its the perfect thing to wash down your torta with.

It's still kind of a dive, but I was pretty shocked to have a hostess seat me, a waitress serve me, and a bar with a random waterfall-like display for food at the prices that I saw online.  A pleasant treat almost as good as the food.  My only disappointment about my meal is I ordered the the tiny torta.  I had the ranchera del pollo; chicken, guacamole, chipotle mayo and cheese.  Very good, and perfect for its price at $7.25, but when I saw waitresses carrying the ridiculously stacked tortas, I have to admit I was hoping mine would be at least close to those.  But I should have known from the short description and cheap price that I was going to get the tinny-tiny sandwich.  My brother ordered a Del Rey.  This awesome monstrosity of a sandwich is stacked with just about every breakfast item you can imagine.  He usually eats healthy, but he enjoyed every bite he was able to take of it (although this was was one of the big ones and he could only manage half).  One thing kind of bugs me for some odd reason.  Potato chips as a side seems kind of random.  I know that tortas are sandwiches, but why isn't a mexican place serving tortilla chips?

    "text": "After much prodding from a favorite client to try this place, my husband and I went on Saturday night.  We were seated right away and for being where it is,  it was pretty OK inside. Our waitress was very nice and attentive the whole meal. I had the king tacos ( client's recommendation) and they were Delicious, 3 soft tacos with really good chicken, I don't know what they marinate it in but moist,  flavorful and cooked to perfection, perfectly sauteed onions on top with just the right amount of cheese. I had the horchata and it was excellent. Husband had the Del Ray of course and it kinda grossed me out a bit but he enjoyed it, I had a bite and that was enough, it was huge so he took half home and enjoyed the rest for breakfast the next day, he also ordered a side of beans and they were really good and not your  typical refried beans,  they were a white bean with a little cheese on top, Yummy. he also had the vampiro to drink, it was beets and other veggies juiced and he loved it, it did look just like blood. all in all it was really good andwe will definitely go back.",

Probably the best mexican food I've ever had. The ceviche was to die for and the steak in the tacos and burritos was so juicy, tender and tasty. We loved it so much we went back two days later!  Would have gone back the very next day, but had to finish the leftovers since they have huge proportions!",

However, all of the hype on yelp and man vs. food was appropriate, as the torta provided a massive yet tasty introduction to pork, turkey, guacamole, and a bunch of other hidden great tastes all in one sandwich.  The carne asada quesadilla blew us away-- HUGE in portion, amazing meat, and super flavorful.  I was also glad to be one of the few gringos in this place.  People were friendly toward us in any case.  Check out the horchata for some authentic aguas frescas...",

My girlfriend absolutely loves this place and I've become a fan as well.     Good food, good prices, good service, I'm there, and I'll be back, again and again.    Their flan is terrific and the selection of tortas and burro's is outstanding as well.     Give this place a shot, you won't regret it, beats the pants off the gringo fast-food establishments like Taco Bell.",

Husband HAD to try the Del Rey Torta (eaten by Adam on the show) and darn, the thing is huge. I had another, which was beef, jalapeno, grilled onions, avocado, chipotle. YUMMY. Wish they had fries instead of chips with sandwiches. Everyone within earshot said this was very authentic mexican food. The platters coming out were massive. The agua frescas were delicious (we had mango and pina). Now, if only I could have had a tecate, life would have been perfect. We had two tortas and two agua frescas for $22. Quite a deal. Prices seemed great, and I would love to try anything else on the menu, which is quite large. We will be back!",

They have nice marqaritas and crappy beer to wash the food down.",

    "text": "Los Reyes has gotten such rave reviews, perhaps my expectations were too high, but I thought that the Torta Los Reyes, their signature torta, was just a glorified Denny's Grand Slamwich with hot sauce. I didn't find the meat that flavorful, nor the sauces. That said, the restaurant is surprisingly nice inside, the service is prompt and friendly, and the mango agua fresca was amazing. Maybe I'm just not the torta type, because for the most part, I'm a healthy eater and avoid beef, pork, and ham. My dad, on the other hand, loved the torta.",

But I have to mention that my greatest dining pet peeve happens here everytime. When I get my hand written receipt, it never has prices on in, not even the tax. I get a list of my drinks and entrees and a total. I do guestimate every bill and it does seem accurate, but that is super annoying. Their menu does state they autimatically add 15% gratituity for parties of 6 or more. Now, I have never been here with more than 4 people and always tip 30-40%. My point is, how would you know if you are being (double) charged for tipping with a large party unless you happened to see that on the menu. I am sure most don't read the whole menu. I will be back, I hope in the next few days = ). I just wanted to give you all a heads up!!",

    "text": "My husband and I are kind of Mexican food snobs -- he grew up in Mexico City and takes grave offense to any kind of bell peppers in his food, which was tough when we lived in Texas.  Because  we've been burned often by Mexican places filling cheese enchiladas with Velveeta and similar atrocities, it's a hard sell to get us to try new Mexican restaurants.  But Man vs. Food (plus several enthusiastic recommendations by our friends) won out, and we had to go to try Los Reyes.  It is amazing!  They have things on the menu I haven't even seen since the last time we visited Mexico City (like alambres) and an amazing selection of food at good prices.  My husband had the milanesa torta; milanesa is one of those foods you think should be easy to make but that can go terribly wrong.  His was perfect, and he had no complaints about anything. They also have an amazing collection of fresh fruit juices, including some of the more unusual mixes like the vampiro.  My sincronizada was terrific.  The service was great, too -- our waitress checked up on us several times, as did the other wait staff.  One word of caution:  the guacamole is really more like just flat out avocado.  It's not bad at all, but it wasn't what I was expecting.  Still, this place definitely exceeded my expectations and we'll absolutely be back!",

    "text": "I admit it.  I found this place through Man vs Food.  It did live up to the hype and not just for the tortas.  But first, let's start with the tortas.  I can only speak for the torta del rey and it was as huge as the one on TV.  The mix of meat along with egg, tomato and avocado was delicious and the taste very unique.  Something that does not get enough attention is their large selection of fruit juices and smoothies.  Since I couldn't decide between all the juice choices, I got a plain old pina colada.  It was really good - not too sweet.  My friend was more adventurous and got some drink named _?_eskimo_?_ - also very good.  Next time I go back, I will definitely try a fruit juice.  They had a lot of fruit in their fridge so it should be good.  Another plus is their 99 cent ceviche tostada.  It is a small tostada topped with shrimp ceviche and a slice of avocado.  Very refreshing and a great way to ease yourself into consuming a torta.  Lastly, the service was good and the inside of the restaurant was bright and clean.  There is no reason not to go back.  Remember to bring your appetite because the sandwich is quite filling.",

    "text": "Wow this place is another hole in the wall gem.  this food is as authentic as it gets.  It was recommended to me by a friend that is from Mexico.  Its probably not exactly like they do it there, but I am told its as close as you'll get up here.  The prices are very fair, and the portions are generous.  You might even need to spit it up if you are not a big appetite.  All the food is fresh, and the service was great.  You know that you have hit the right place for authenticity when you are the only gringo in the place, and Spanish language ESPN is on the TV.  You have to try a torta if you go there for the first time.  I mean the name King of Tortas say it all.  I recommend the agua frescas too, as that was such a great combination with the heat of the food.  I have been there a few times, and both the cuban and carne asada were not to disappoint.  There is plenty of seating, and I did not have to wait to be seated on any of my visits.",
