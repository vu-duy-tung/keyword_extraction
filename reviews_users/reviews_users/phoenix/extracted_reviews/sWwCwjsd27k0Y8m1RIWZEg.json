Everyone at the table enjoyed their entrees (short rib, fish special, chicken).  The appetizers were also great (beet salad, burrata). The only issue was that the server seemed a little pissy, but it wasn't anything that bothered us too much. I would definitely go back.",

The location was about 20 miles away from down town Phoenix located in a ritzy dirt road area that was fairly easy to find. The interior seemed upper class mid 90's. The waiter was attentive and the sticky buns served as appetizers were just as appealing as they were delicious. Would ONLY recommend if the price was lower and the location wasn't a day drive.",

It was quite a refreshing break from all the Mexican restaurants in Phoenix. A definite recommendation!",

You could get around to each winery's station and not be too crowded. That was the best part.  However the food was set up outside and as it got later and darker, no provision was made to light the food stations. You could not read the signs identifying the dish - nor could you see the food. I would have expected the foresight to light it up outside, especially over the food pans and buffet. The food was very good, but we had to use our iPhones to see the food, including 5 or 6 different hummus flavors. It was all finger foods and we could not find napkins to clean up after eating the short ribs and mashed potatoes or the chicken.  Good food, bad planning for a buffet.",

I looked at your website at 11:09am  today and copied and pasted the information from your website that said Happy hour was from 4-6 and the buffet was from 5-6.  I will copy and paste my email to my friend. (Copied at the end of this review)  We decided to meet at 4:30.  According to our watches we went to the buffet at appx 4:58 and there was nothing there.  We visited a while longer and returned at 5:08 and there was nothing but there was a sign that said as of today the buffet was from 4-5.  We went ahead and ordered but asked for the manager, Steven.  He came over but said the website was changed this morning.  I said I copied and pasted from the website today and my friend could not find the email.  I then looked through my sent and found the email.  I asked to see him again and showed him.  I really didn't want him to do anything except acknowledge that we were right...it did say that.  Instead he told me it was changed earlier in the day. I mentioned we came there often with friends and he said people got emails of the time change.  I didn't.  I just wanted him to say he was sorry for the confusion or something...he was rude.  The email is at the bottom of this email.  The food was good but the management is bad.  He should have just apologized and said it should have been changed earlier.

This special event features 11 (count them) ELEVEN American whiskies complete with Alec's excellent instruction. A great night out- including a delicious braised beef ribs and chile pepper risotto. I would give this 10 stars- but for a couple suggestions. Or I would make it 4 & 15/16 stars...  They brought the infamous sticky buns at the beginning - but after much whiskey drinking only the dinner came. I would complement the tasting with some small appetizers. Also I would add a small cheese course and a small chocolate dessert for the end tastings. Great restaurant that I can tell has owners who care and are present. You can ALWAYS tell the difference. Check out the website for a rocking happy hour too.",

The lobster bisque was not great, as here was no real lobster in it and they put too much sour cream, giving it a sour taste all together.  The other option on the christmas menu for a starter was a pear salad which was also just so-so.   The salmon was great and it came with root vegetables hat were all cooked well and complimented the salmon nicely.

The restaurant itself is beautiful and the views of the mountains are awesome.  There is a free parking lot but also the option to pay for valet ($5).  My friend and I both ordered the Kale/arugula salad for starters, 6 oz sirloin for entree, and sorbet (their gluten-free option) for dessert.  We liked pretty much everything about the food and loved the way they cooked the steak (medium rare).  Service from our server left a lot to be desired.  First, when we only ordered water, he offered us \"wine? cocktails? shots?\" and when we declined he sarcastically remarked \"oh.. it's a party over here, really exciting\"  Sorry we couldn't be more drunk for you...?  My friend commented that it was weird to feel peer-pressured by your waiter.    He didn't really say anything else rude that I can remember, but his general vibe was condescending and off-putting.  We definitely felt more welcome and comfortable with the employees who delivered our food and our hostesses.  Lastly, at the end of the meal, even though we were only a party of 2, he added in gratuity.  I don't know if he thought we looked cheap or what, but that did not leave a positive impression.  It was also unnecessary because I used to work as a server so I always tip 20% or more.  I felt like crossing out the tip entirely and just stiffing him, but I decided to not be petty.  My friend and I were laughing about how unpleasant the service was, but in all seriousness it did detract from the experience.",

We should have turned around but had a drink at the bar. We told the bartender the host said we couldn't order food and he said \"that's not True, that's ridiculous.\" As much as he tried to expedite our appetizer, which we did end up ordering, and later our entrees, we should have left before ordering any food. In fact 2 other servers were complaining that their diners had gotten up and walked out, disgruntled waiting for their food.  It's a shame because it's in a very nice area, Paradise Valley, and with such a lovely setting the service should be top notch. The entrees were good but not worth the  wait.",

We completely enjoyed our selections to the last bite.  They included braised short ribs, a filet with crab cake special and roasted jumbo shrimp with risotto.  The heirloom tomato with burrata salad is so delicious.  Having experienced Napa Valley cuisine for many years, the El Chorro is right there in the same class serving great food in the Southwest Desert.  The bartender for cocktails and our table server were top-notch and offered outstanding service.  One issue came up with the hostess that showed us to our table.  We asked to be seated at a table next to a window very close to the table we were given. The dining room was half empty with most customers seated outside on the patio.  She declined our request and told us the table was previously reserved.  We dined for three hours and the table we requested was never used, as were many other tables in the dining room.    To uphold the top level of cuisine and customer service, let alone what we paid (+$300) for three - the hostess staff should always attempt to honor a customer's request and be sure they don't look unprofessional in the end.",

    "text": "10/16/2016  Yelp review Scottsdale, AZ El Charro 5550 E Lincoln Dr.  ~2 mi (480) 964-1851  El Charro is hands down the best fine dining dinner spot in the Phoenix, Scottsdale, Paradise Valley area.  I am a fine dining snob and I have high expectations for restaurants that I plan on eating an expensive meal at and El Charro never disappoints.  Whether you desire a delicious, juicy filet, or flavorful seafood, this is the place to go if you don't mind forking over some cash.  My experience started the moment I walked through the adobe arch reading \"El Charro\" which is a gateway into the beautiful, romantically lit patio that spans around the open, cozy, adobe restaurant in a nice wide L shape. When I went to El Chorro recently, I did have to wait for my table, but I was able to go and sit at their bar area where I was well taken care of as I waited to be seated.  We were seated about 15 minutes after arriving, but my experience at the bar helped pass the time extremely fast and I gladly say out my wait enjoying my time at the bar.  Once I made my way to the table, covered in a beautiful white linen, and sat in comfortably cushioned chairs, I was almost immediately brought a glass of water and was served their famous sticky buns which they serve to their guests instead of bread.  The sticky buns came out a perfectly warm temperature and were so gooey and delicious.  My server was extremely prompt and made sure to get us our drinks as quickly as possible.    I ordered the 8oz. center cut filet, served with parmesan scalloped potatoes, asparagus and pink peppercorn sauce on the side.  This entree totals about $45, but on this particular night I added jumbo shrimp to make it a surf & turf which ran the cost up to about $52.  A price well worth paying in my opinion.  [picture on the bottom of page] The presentation was stunning and I honestly could not wait to dive into my plate and consume this meal as quickly as my body would allow. Everything came out the perfect temperature and I knew as soon as everything on that plate was finished being cooked, they brought it out immediately.   I enjoy my filet medium rare, and unlike most places who tend to go a little too rare when I request this, this steak was perfect.  It was so tender and juicy that I did not even use my peppercorn sauce because the steak itself didn't even need anything more.  The scalloped potatoes were creamy and delicious and came out in a nice large helping. The asparagus was cooked to perfection so that they still crunch when you bite into them but are soft enough you don't feel like you're eating asparagus al dente. The shrimp was extremely tasty and HUGE.  You really get your moneys worth for upgrading the plate to a surf and turf.   My parents were celebrating their 30th anniversary this night, and in order to celebrate, the restaurant gave them a complimentary dessert that included a graham cracker crusted white and milk chocolate mousse. The flavors were delectable and I wished this dessert would never end.    Our waitress, Andrea, was an incredibly nice and a very efficient waitress.  She clearly enjoyed her job and served with poise and class.  She made sure we had everything we needed and I never felt like I was abandoned at my table.    I would give my experience at El Charro ***** out of ***** stars for its comfortable, open atmosphere, incredible and efficient service, and mouthwatering, cooked to perfection food that is consistently good every time I come to the restaurant.",

The inside has sliding doors, so on nice days (or nights), they open them up for a lovely indoor/outdoor dining experience. Food and service are always good. I recommend the flash fried lobster medallions - expensive but worth it. I usually order that for my entree. Sticky buns are served instead of regular rolls with dinner and are delicious. If you're looking for a special place to bring out of town guests, this is the perfect spot.",

    "text": "My hubby and I came here by mistake on a Friday evening. For some reason, I thought that this El Chorro was the same Mexican food restaurant that we used to go to in Tucson, but this restaurant was entirely different. The chicken enchilada dish was only one dish on the entire menu that was Mexican.  Oops, my bad! I guess I should've checked with Yelp first to determine what type of restaurant it was, How cool is it that a restaurant reused what was once a girls' school and converted it to one of the most renowned destination restaurants?!  The ambiance was much different as well. It was more refined, polished, and provided a beautiful backdrop of Camelback Mountain. It felt warm and cozy as well, as though we were entering a nestled mission in the middle of the desert. The patio was very inviting and filled with people enjoying good conversation and food under trees covered in warm lighting. Had I researched first, I might've worn something nicer, instead of our extra casual attire. DId that matter to them? No, they treated us very well! Our waiter James was very attentive and made sure that we had no shortage of their famous sticky buns. The sticky buns are so good that they even take orders  \"To Go\" if you so desire.  We started off with the Pepper Pot Shrimp Appetizer. It was served with rich, flavorful shrimp bathed in a pepper stew that could've been an entree in itself. The toasted homemade bread reached a state of nirvana  in taste once it was dipped in the pepper pot stew mixture.   We splurged and tried the Chateaubriand meal for two. It came with the most tender, meaty goodness of filet served medium rare  (as requested) roasted in the oven and served with sides of a cabernet type red sauce made from the filet's own juices and also a decadent, creamy Bernaise sauce. Roasted asparagus, carrots, and red seasoned potatoes surrounded this platter of perfection.   The chateaubriand meal also came with a dessert. We chose a butter cake with Dolce de Leche ice cream. Forget your typical Sara Lee pound cake. This butter cake puts that Sara Lee pound cake to shame! The cake was neither dense nor too light and flaky. The cake's texture was that of a thicker sponge, but the fork cut easily though the cake like butter. The sweet Dolce de Leche ice cream with the cream cheese, and thicker spongy cake complimented each other quite well.   We were so tired by the end of all this eating that we woke ourselves up with some espresso there and called it a night. After the appetizer, wine, the magnificent Chateaubriand, and dessert with espresso, let's just say our bill was not cheap. In fact, I would definitely call the night done \"on a whim\" one of those crazy splurges. That won't stop us from coming back for more though! Bravo El Chorro for giving us a wonderful night to remember!",

Our waitress was rude, the hostess was rude. Drinks were bad. We called ahead to reserve a table outside for happy hour on the patio at a table to which they said you don't need one it's first come first serve. We get there and it's only at the bar and communal table so we have to sit inside at 4:30 when the entire patio is empty. We have eaten out there for HH before. Maybe this place is fun if you're senile but the cute fountain outside isn't worth the crappy attitudes and bad drinks. Apparently the food is terrible too but I didn't wait around to find out. Don't waste your money or your time.",

    "text": "I was extremely disappointed with our brunch today. Our party of 6 was celebrating a couple birthdays at a restaurant that, in the past, we'd had nothing but praise. The dissatisfaction started with $6 valet parking in a parking lot that blocks off all paved parking for valet. In a town where people wear sandals year round, have to shake pebbles out of your shoes before entering the restaurant isn't fun. Upon being seated, our waitress took a few of our drink orders while the rest needed time to decide. Brought those drinks quickly, then disappeared for a while. Eventually returned to take our order. Decided to try the Tangerine Freeze, a very decent shake, with booze, that tastes just like an orange push-up. It would have been nice had the person that prepared the drinks, also wiped all the ice cream of the outside of the glass so you could pick it up without getting sticky fingers. One of our dining companions wanted the breakfast flat bread, but can't have cheese. This proved a problem because all the flatbreads, every single one in the kitchen, were already prepped with cheese. Fine, orders something else. The omelette special was a ribeye steak with grilled onions and peppers. Came out, and actually looking like an omelette, instead of over cooked unscrambled eggs, a plus, but was barely warm and the steak was completely over-cooked and leathery. The avocado BLT tasted ok, but the bacon was soggy, cold, and far removed from crisp. The biscuit and sausage gravy was very disappointing; biscuits dry and tough, gravy cold and stingy. Most of the breakfasts included an English muffin, which was cold, soaked in butter, and not really toasted much at all. The potatoes where giant chunks of potato that had been deep fried, while seasoned nicely, they also were not crispy, actually almost soggy, and not remotely cooked all the way through. As others have noted, server attentiveness seems to fall off as the meal progressed.   Overall, I don't expect any in our group to return. It's apparent that the remodel a few years ago, not only took away the homey essence, but removed the kitchen from any semblance of providing warm, let alone hot food. An ignoble end, to what was once a great restaurant with an awesome view, and turned it into a restaurant simply going through the motions and charging a premium for subpar food.",

My family usually only goes there for Thanksgiving and Christmas. This Thanksgiving was another wonderful experience. Great food, great service and a beautiful setting.  Holiday lunch/dinner is a set menu with your choice of a beef, turkey or fish.  Since it was Thanksgiving I opted for the turkey dinner served with all the traditional accompaniments; mashed potatoes and gravy, stuffing, green beans and of course cranberry sauce. Also included to start out is a relish tray of mixed fresh veggies, a bowl of candied fruit and nuts, El Chorro's famous sticky buns and your choice of soup or salad. I chose the Waldorf salad to start.   Everything was fantastic!  There was also a choice of three desserts at the end but I just didn't have room so I took my pumpkin pie to go.    Ron was our server. What a nice guy! He made us feel so welcome, we didn't feel rushed (El Chorro is very busy) and he had a great sense of humor. We hope to get Ron again for our Christmas dinner.   Reservations are always a good idea at El Chorro and an absolute must for a holiday. I recommend making reservations at least two months in advance for Thanksgiving, Christmas and Easter.   Enjoy!",

I did take off a star for their bizarre and annoying valet tagging system which was the only blip in my otherwise flawless experience. My appetizers came out quickly and were quite tasty. The main course followed after just the right amount of time. The turkey was juicy and flavorful with perfect sides of mashed potatoes. I followed with cheesecake for dessert which was equally wonderful. This is a pricey restaurant, but I think the food, ambiance, and service make it worth while.",

We like their menu and always find something different to eat that we like.  Last time, I had the Santa Barbara Mussels for an appetizer, which were excellent.  This time, we had the cheese and charcuterie plate.  For two people, it was more than enough.  I thought they were a bit skimpy with the charcuterie they offered and I was not impressed with the cheeses they offered - a blue cheese, cheddar, triple cream and perhaps manchego, which was the tastiest.  For dinner, I had the seafood pasta. Again, it was pretty tasty although they again were a bit skimpy with the seafood.  They only put three mussels in the seafood and clams were few in number as well.  The two other people in my party enjoyed the food more and enjoyed their fillet and rack of lamb..  When we go back next time, I will stick to the mussels for an appetizer and the fillet, and maybe one day, I will save room for desert.  Again great service and ambience on the patio is fantastic.",

We are a decent sized company so we had a room to ourselves in the back of the property. It looked like it was a room that could be used for wedding receptions or any other kind of party. There were several large round tables set up and a full bar in the back. There was an outdoor area too but it was night and kinda chilly so everyone stayed inside for the most part. Another plus was that there was plenty of parking. It's not always easy to find ample parking for a group of 100+.  The evening started with passed hors d'oeuvres that were delish - prosciutto-wrapped scallops, crab-cakes and an onion tartlette of some kind. Whatever it was it tasted good! The staff was very friendly and accommodating to our group.  For dinner I had the shortribs which came with a side of beans and potatoes. It was really good. The meat was extremely tender (melt-in-your-mouth-type), cooked to perfection and juicy and flavorful. Shortribs are not a lean cut of beef but it was worth it. I enjoyed every bite.  One person at our table got a very tough tough piece of fish and they had no problem replacing her meal as quickly as possible without hassle.   Overall, we had a very nice time, the food was great and the staff friendly. I'd highly recommend El Chorro for a corporate party or reception.",

Ah yes, a beautiful poached egg, which bursts when pierced, spilling it's silky, golden yolk.   Ok so now that we've had our lesson, let's put it into practice. My eggs Benedict was served with three quartered tomatoes, very very very crunchy potatoes with no seasoning and two eggs Benedict. One was completely missing a yolk! Bummer. When our server came over, I told him and he brought out a new one, but the yolk was overcooked. Bummer, times two. My friend also had an overcooked egg on his plate.  For the prices they're charging, we should have had four perfectly cooked eggs and well seasoned potatoes. It's brunch, not brain surgery.

You can't go wrong with the steak, always delicious, but the more unique menu choices are also amazing!  Try the lamb or the Stroganoff!  El Chorro is full of charm, great service, and Arizona history!  Don't forget to take a look around and read the amazing history!  Always a favorite!",

    "text": "The husband and I originally came here for a Yelp Cocktail Society event and decided we should come back to try more of the menu since the appetizers were delicious. I received an email regarding their Christmas dinner, which included Lobster Bisque, so the husband was sold and reservations were made.   We sat inside, but the patio looked very pretty and inviting with the lights. However, just a tad too chilly! Our server was nice and helpful and while the restaurant didn't seem very busy, the service was a little slow. (People seated after us received their food before us and such. Not sure where the holdup was!)  The husband ordered the lobster bisque and I ordered the salad off the Christmas Prix Fixe Menu as our starters. The husband liked his bisque and my salad was good. Neither appetizer was spectacular but not bad. For our main course, both of us ordered the Roasted Beef Tenderloin with horseradish potatoes. The beef was tender and the potatoes were good. I liked them together, as the beef needed a little extra spice. The beef alone didn't have much flavor/spice otherwise. (The husband wasn't very impressed and had to order an extra side of horseradish.) For dessert, we both ordered the bread pudding - big mistake. Yes, the portion of bread pudding was huge but it was also bland. It wasn't like any other bread pudding I've had before, more like a thick sponge cut in half. I saw other diners order the red velvet cake and was immediately jealous. (I'm a huge desert person and barely ate this bread pudding.)  Overall, the dinner was okay, but definitely not my favorite. For the price, I feel like we could have gone somewhere else and received a better meal overall.   ***Not being factored into the review, but something I wanted to bring up: The husband and I received 2 gift cards from our Yelp Cocktail Event - completely free. This was a very generous offer from the establishment and much appreciated. We were very excited to come back and to use the gift cards. As we were paying for our meal, we had the waiter check the denomination as we were never told the amount on the cards. Unfortunately, one of the gift cards was blank. I understand that they were free gift cards, but anyone would expect them not to be blank. Just a tad disappointing and hope no one else received a blank card as well! Please note, this is not being factored into the review, as I am only basing the stars given on the food and service.***",

    "text": "This is not going to be a good review. Why?  Because I have been there 3 times and spoke very highly of this place, and from the moment we entered it was a disappointment, not only to me and my husband, but our guests as well. First off it was summer, we normally are in Arizona in winter.  But it was a lovely evening for the patio.  The patio looked quite different, no tables set, no menus, no Ambiance at all.  The hostess was quite rude when we mentioned wanting to sit on the patio. And in her answer of Yes we can sit outside, but she would have to find a server.  That in itself sounded strange.  She could have shared, that to them it's summer and most people want to be inside, but no, she shared nothing but a poor attitude.  So then we decided we were not going to get good service outside and then chose to go in doors. Five o'clock starts Happy Hour, and we were there before 5.  So we sat down.  No one bothered to come to our table.  It's 10 after Five, 10 minutes went by and again, no one.  My husband stopped a busboy and asked if a waitress could come to our table?  When the waitress finally showed up, no apology, and a bit of an attitude AGAIN.  THEN A MANAGER came by and we let him know our feelings.  He came out with some Sticky Rolls as an apology. First off we ordered liquor drinks, Sticky rolls don't go with liquor.  Then we see he returned and gave the table near us the same thing, so no he really didn't care about us either.  The food we always ordered, was Just not good.  We ordered six appetizers to start, everything tasted like it was first frozen, just sad that a lovely place turned so bad in just a few months.  We had just been there in March of 2017 and this was Sept. 2017 was it under new management? New hostess new waitresses Something had to change because the Caring, was missing, big time, and so will we be....",

At El Chorro, diners must apparently accommodate your chef not themselves.   I appreciate that you serve 400 people at once but you should do it one customer at a tine.  And when we were there, the dining room was only half full.  Apparently you disregarded my complaint with an odd offer to have us back.  We left Sunday because there was no one item on the menu that my daughter could have.  Not one thing. And you wouldn't even leave out cheese (which she is allergic to) from an omelette so she could find something to eat.   Because of your unnecessary inflexibility, anyone with or without a food allergy that would like to be in control of what they eat  should avoid El Charro.  It could be toxic.",

It seemed that the chef staff has very little experience in what people want when it comes to a buffet.  No scrambled eggs, pancakes with what looked like thick gravy on them (actually some thick walnut sauce..great for those people with nut allergies)  NO waffle bar where you can dress your own, too much shrimp and shellfish, and the dessert table...SHAMEFUL! Also, just a word to the clueless staff that seats people.  When you see that a person has a wheelchair or walker, don't be stupid enough to make them go through an obstacle course of tables and chairs, and don't seat people with handicaps so far from the main entrance.  When someone calls for a reservation ASK if there are guests with physical limitations before you drag them all the way to Casa Palomares, or BFE.  I told the girl I made reservations with that mother was handicapped, and I guess that flew over her head.  Perhaps a call to the ADA would remedy that.   The banquet room was so small and it seems that not only were guests in each others way, but trying to manuever around tables was like making your way around a giant obstacle course. Next year..T.

(restaurant week menu) - Watermelon, Tomato, & Jicama Salad, Polenta & Vegetable Napoleon, and strawberry shortcake.  (regular menu) - Shrimp pepper pot and Beef Stroganoff   The highlights on the food include the Beef Stroganoff (the fresh pasta and the sauce was superb) and the Polenta & Vegetable Napoleon (beautiful dish and vegetables were cooked nicely). The sauce on the shrimp pepper pot was flavorful but felt there was way too much bread served and would have preferred if the shrimp tails would have been pulled off. In addition, the salad and the strawberry shortcake was nothing to rave about.   Now onto the service. It was hugely underwhelming. For a fine establishment to have their patrons push aside their finished plates (pre-bus) for the staff and not have one our water glasses refilled throughout the entire dining experience was a vast disappointment and inexcusable. Our plates were not picked up until the next course arrived. We do not blame our server since she was occupied with other tables (who all were sat at about the same time) but there were multiple staff members around who completely zoned us out. Why bother when it isn't your table right?   All in all, El Chorro had tremendous potential but we left dissatisfied with the experience and will keep El Chorro off our list of restaurants in Scottsdale. Plenty of other high-quality restaurants to spend $150+ in Scottsdale/Phoenix.",

    "text": "Dant, Dant, Dant, Daaaaaaa! Tada, my 500th review! Yeah and what a fabulous review it will be. This place has been around for years and has a fascinating history. El Chorro is historic staple in Paradise Valley set around gorgeous views of Camelback and Mummy mountain. I have been wanting to go here for 30 pus years but never seem to have gotten around to it for whatever varied reasons. Once upon a time they used to close during the summer. However, now I hear it is under new management and was recently remodeled. Well, for my 500 review I picked their Happy Hour. We all had a great time at my UYE. Sorry peeps for being so early but it goes until 6pm so let's do it again sometime.   it was a small gathering but thanks friends for coming out. The Happy Hour here we have decided is the best Happy Hour in town. The food was delicious and the drinks were a great deal. 3 dollar wine and 5 dollar beers. 5 dollar food plates. We could not believe it! The final bill was very reasonable and we left totally stuffed. Okay well, I did stop at Sweet Republic on the way home but only because I was mad that I forgot to order Chorro's famous sticky buns. Sigh! Oh well, just another reason a return trip is mandated.  We sat on the patio at the community table and met some cool folks from Connecticut with Long Island roots. The weather was great and the company was superb!  Although a bit windy and hot it was cool on the patio with the misters. And seriously, that view! It can't be beat.   For food we ordered a variety of plates off their Happy Hour menu, Chicken Livers ( Not me), vegetable Crudite with Hummus, shrimp ( My favorite), SW Poutine ( I finally tried Poutine), Sliders with fries, and more chicken livers.  (Again not for me-YUK!- lol) My friends claim the chicken livers were great if you like that sort of thing. (Again not for me)   The wine and beer selection is pretty good and great price! We liked the white.   The view is spectacular.   Many return trips seen in my future.",

Went last night for birthday dinner: Atmosphere: 5 Stars Service: 5 Stars Food: 4.5 Stars   Outdoor dining at its finest in Arizona, service was impeccable.  Knowledgeable server, outstanding assistance with wine selection, prompt curious and friendly.  Drinks never empty, food served promptly, and cleared immediately, but never rushed.  Day before they call to confirm reservation and preferred seating; day after they even follow-up with a phone call for your feedback on your dining experience.  Signature sticky buns served timely, warm and delicious.  Wine and bourbon old fashion were great, started with crab cakes which were made to perfection.  Shrimp and beef stroganoff entrees well seasoned, served piping hot and very good, tenderloin was melt in your mouth tender.  I indicted birthday on open table reservation, but did not say anything to wait staff or hostess when they called the day prior; however, we were served a free white chocolate desert complete with candle....nice touch.    If you haven't tried El Chorro, it rates as top 10 food destination in Phoenix, don't miss it!",

We were told this was a staple in Az, little did we know that was until they were bought out about a decade ago. If you have no taste buds left, or still like your food prepared in the most uncaringly sloppy way possible, this is your spot. My steak almost moped at me, even though I asked for a touch under medium. The bearnaise sauce was so flavorless and improperly prepared that I thought that they had gotten it wrong and put a different sauce on my steak. I don't think there was a highlight to the meal, even after making a complaint to the waiter, and sending the steak away basically uneaten he simply did nothing about it and offered us a desert that I tried to decline, and wish I had as it was just as boring and uninspired. Save your money and go to steak44 or somewhere with a pulse. This place is a complete waste",

To start we had the Artisan Cheese & Charcuterie plate, flash fried lobster bites and the crab and tuna dynamite.  They were all great but the best bang for your buck will be the charcuterie plate which pairs well with their Slingshot Cabernet Sauvignon. I ordered the Lamb Loin Chops and they were pretty good but just a little dry.  I should have gone with my initial choice which was the braised short ribs.  My neighbor ordered those and they looked amazing!  The only strange part was that they brought out their famous sticky buns (their house cinnamon rolls) before our entree's. I don't know about you but I like to wait to eat the sweet stuff after I have had my savory entree.  I would recommend it if you are trying to entertain out of town guests and it's also a great place for work get togethers.",

That was the first 'red flag.' In my opinion, a venue cannot feel intimate (especially for a wedding) with that many other people around you.  We sat at the bar to try the happy hour menu. We ordered the twisted deviled eggs, the fish tacos, the perfect storm and the truffle fries. And sadly, we were unimpressed. The deviled eggs were deep fried and the fish tacos were served with a cheap white fish. The calamari was decent, but could have been cooked a tad longer. Which left the truffle fries.. and those were actually good! But it's hard to mess up truffle fries.   I hear the main dinner menu is much better. And they are known for their infamous 'beer burro'. I would be willing to go back to El Chorro to try the main menu, the sticky buns and see the burro. But right now I don't think it's worth all the hype.",

It had strawberries, blueberries, bananas, granola and fresh honey. That was my favorite. The fruit was nice with cantaloupe, grapes, pineapple and honeydew. The bread was ok but a bit dry. I preferred the roll basket they gave at the beginning with the sticky rolls, a scone, and a croissant.  The grounds and atmosphere were beautiful. We explored a bit after and found it was set up for a wedding. I had to share a picture of the cute getaway Jeep!",

We went last night and took a bunch of friends who had never been before and had the most horrible experience I have ever had - potentially at any restaurant. Because of the rain we had to sit at a community table inside near the bar for a group of eight.   The waitress was extremely annoyed and rude that we were ordering dinner at this table even though that is where the host set us up. One would think she'd be excited to have a big table of adults racking up drinks and ordering full dinners. We would have stayed for more drinks had the service not been so horrible.   Even though the food and drinks were great, the service was such a turn off that I will definitely rethink coming here again.",

From palm trees to outdoor fireplaces this is one of the nicest restaurants I've ever seen. I really love how warm and inviting it is. There is an abundance of outdoor seating and with the heat lamps and fireplace it really does keep the temperature nice and toasty (it was a mild 55).   Went into the bar and sat down at high top tables and was greeted with a basket of nirvana in the form of sticky buns. They know they could sell these things, right? WTH? I have never in all of my life been greeted with something so delicious when I sat down at a restaurant table. Go away, Cinnabon, you've been replaced, and handily. Hasta.   Ordered a glass of mediocre wine, Bogle. You can buy this wine for $8 a bottle at Total Wine so I certainly wouldn't pay $9 for a glass, but I wasn't paying, so...it was decent if you're getting it for free!  Anyway, onto the bar menu, which the only thing I ate off of. Ordered the mini grilled cheese sandwiches with three artisan cheeses. One happened to be blue cheese which I despise and waited until the last one to eat it. I asked the waitress, fabulous Rachel, if I could replace this with the brie and she said of course! She then proceeded to bring me a WHOLE plate of sandwiches! For free! You have to love great service! A co-worker got the chicken enchiladas, and while they were delicious, they had a sting to them so be careful! Those were on the dinner menu, not bar menu, by the way.   As we were leaving I asked for some sticky buns to go and Rachel brought a nice sized to go box of them for us. Thank you!!!   I could see spending a lot of time here if I lived in this area. It's beautiful, the staff is friendly (especially Rachel!) and the food is delicious! I would definitely highly recommend and I'll be SO jealous if you go!",

    "text": "Five stars, however, El Chorro deserves more than just lowly stars.  El Chorro deserves a rating system of a different sort.   El Chorro, for all its perfection, deserves a rating system using little baby unicorns decked-out in jewels and adorned with splendid colorful pageantry.  The unicorns would smell heavenly too; a blend of newborn baby and warmed Ghirardelli chocolate. Under this rating system, I'd give El Chorro the highest rating possible.  From beginning to end, the El Chorro experience was impeccable.  Service, ambiance, food, and drink; all were flawless. I even liked the valet for Christ's sakes.  The duck breast was so delicious, each bite had me wishing ducks had more breasts, like dogs. If they did, I'd devour every last one of them. In fact, the preparation was so perfect with its melt in your mouth texture, I'd have no reservations about eating the bill, feathers, webbed feet, private parts, and quack. I've never sampled duck breast this delicious!  For appetizers, consider the tomato and burrata cheese plate. The cheese is velvety smooth and creamy. The balsamic, thick and sweet, likely from Modena and not Milwaukee. The tomatoes come from their garden; red, ripe and dripping with sweet juicy goodness. In concert, these flavors will excite your taste buds, giving them little tiny taste bud boners.   For dessert, try the strawberry shortcake. The chef prepares a wonderfully delicious shortbread cake, presenting it in a small pond of berry compote.  And in the berry pond, a plethora of fresh berries, feverishly swimming about in an ill-fated attempt to avoid my fork.  This is a dessert to behold and I strongly recommend you consume it at warp speed, this so you can steal shovelfuls from your dining partner's plate when she's not paying attention.  Probably the best reason to visit El Chorro, other than the aforementioned is the stunning view of Camelback mountain at sunset. Truly remarkable. I recommend patio seating for the best view.  The next time I visit, I'm bringing a toaster along so I can electrocute myself after taking my last bite. Mainly because I can't imagine life getting any better than this.",

This place is expensive, but well worth it for a celebration. It is great for showing out of town guests what Scottsdale is like.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were enjoying a 2 night staycation for the 4th of July at the JW Marriott next door and saw this place when we were pulling in. After looking into it on yelp I was definitely looking forward to giving it a shot.   We walked up to a quaint spot tucked away with cute twinkle lights outside on the patio. Like most people stated in their reviews it's a cute southwest place to get a bite to eat. Kind of made me think of a grandma and grandpas ranch house.   As an appetizer we ordered the flash fried lobster tail. Note to self: if It says \"market price\" as what it is. Our appetizer was $48. Call us novices, but we didn't realize it would cost more than either of our entrees. The appetizer was good and the breeding very light, but if I'm being honest it was not $48 good.   He ordered the salmon with potatoes and veggies and I got the peppercorn filet. The salmon was glazed and pretty d'lish while the potatoes had some kind of chive sour cream in it. Sour cream in mashed potatoes was good but the chive was pretty overbearing. The peppercorn filet was cooked perfectly and it came with a sauce that I really had no use for because I liked the overall flavor of he steak. The sauce it came with was chilled and In a cute little thing to pour it from. My potatoes were more like a hash and they were DELICIOUS!  Oh and we ordered the sticky buns to go and popped them in the microwave later...yum!!  Overall it was good, but I didn't seem to be as taken back as everyone else. The atmosphere as I mentioned is southwest which can feel outdated and the crowd is a bit older. Being up in PV I think this is a bit to be expected.",

One of the runners brought our charcuterie board appetizer and when I asked what was in it he had no idea, seriously?? Honestly I doubt we will be back with so many choices in the valley.",

My wife ordered the jumbo prawn dinner with risotto n asparagus, first thing my wife noticed was one of her jumbo prawns on display on top of her entree was full of poop right on front street the chef couldn't use a pooper scooper??? My steak was a ribeye for 52bucks that was thin, chewy and over cooked. All of this with no comp of any of it to make us feel at least a little better, don't see us going back for a long time!",

Probably the worst margarita I have had in every way. I had the sticky buns (cinnamon buns) for $5 which were tasty and the best part of the experience. The $7 kobe beef sliders (only 2 for $7) were sad, there was very little meat and mainly just a bun with a tomato slice and pickle. Definitely not a good deal. They didn't come with fries either. $3 domestic bottled beers is nothing to write home about.  All in all I would not go back here for happy hour and probably won't give the full menu a shot.",

Our server Nate went out of his way to make us feel welcome and catered to, and complied with each special request with good humor and quick action.

Anyhow we came for our 11:30 reservations on Super Bowl Sunday prepared for the crowds...nope place was less then half full. Strange, but nice for us.  Anywho, I ordered my usual here, the Huevos Rancheros.  For some reason it's completely different here each time. It was pretty good, not what I was expecting, but good. Wifey ordered the Bacon and Eggs, sadly had to be sent back because her over medium eggs were an under cooked runny mess. Our Server had the re cooked and came out great. We also decided to split a bowl of the Chili Verde. Glad we did since I poured it over my Rancheros to liven it up a bit.  The only other gripe I have about this place is the $5 charge for parking. Just odd since they are not in the middle of down town, but out in middle of no where.  I pull up and the Valet actually says \"you wanna pay me 5 bucks now or when you come out?\"  If it weren't for the sticky buns that are there, I would have told him to piss off and left. Just kinda tacky for an alleged high end brunch place.  But, maybe that's why they were less then half full on the biggest weekend of the year for the Valley.",

I had the huevos rancheros and was pleased though the recipe wasn't what I expected.  My wife had the avocado  BLT and was pleased. The martinis were good though a little overpriced. The wine by the glass was a good selection, a little overpriced.  The valet parking is an aggravation.  It feels like a way to extract a few extra dollars plus tip.  It would be nice to have handicapped places nearby the entrance. No other reason this was not a five star experience.",

The sticky buns are as good as everybody says they are.

From the ease of making a reservation on Opentable to speaking to the hostess on the phone and to being warmly welcomed upon our arrival - it was only the beginning of a great experience.  It was a lovely day today sitting on the patio and we had a a great server (Christopher). We both ordered eggs benedict and they were splendid and prepared and delivered to the table in no time. The legendary sticky buns also accompanied our meal and they were beyond delicious but not  as sticky as I expected :-)  El Chorro also serves dinner which I was not aware of and the menu looked very appealing. I highly recommend El Chorro as a special venue for get togethers, birthdays, family celebrations or just simply as a getaway for Sunday brunch or dinner. Enjoy!",

    "text": "El Chorro has amazing views of Camelback Mountain, and is a solid restaurant with what I would call traditional American fare, but the one downside is the rather exorbitant prices, which I guess is to be expected in Paradise Valley.    I initially came into El Chorro for a drink with some friends, and I always like to browse the menu at restaurants whether I am eating or not...then I saw one of their 'classics' and had flashbacks to my mother's amazing homemade beef stroganoff.  Now days in the land of trendy, fusion, hip restaurants such things are not very typical to a menu, so I had to try it and see if it could even compare to my mother's version.  Most stroganoffs at restaurants tend to be on the very creamy side and my mother's is heavier on the au jus from the meat and flavor of the mushrooms, so I asked our amazing bartender if it could be modified (also because I am not a fan of ultra creamy sauces anyway); he obliged and informed me the Chef was in house that evening and he would go consult him.  The bartender came back with outstanding news that the chef would cook it up himself :)    While my meal was in the 'developmental stage' in the back, I finally made it around to deciding on a cocktail.  The bartender was pleasant and asked about my favorite kind of beverage.  I told him I was a big fan of gin, and he said he had the perfect cocktail for me to try: the French 75.  It was a lovely perfumey, bubbly drink that wasn't too sweet or strong (many gin drinks are heavy on the liquor).  For all you people that think gin tastes like pine needles, you need to try some Nolet's Gin; it is more like an English rose garden.  I wouldn't drink that drink regularly, but it was very delicious, flavorful and perfect for good conversation and sipping.  All of my friends tried it and thought it was amazing and couldn't believe there was gin in it haha!   Then my meal arrived and wow!! It looked and smelled amazing and amazingly like my mom's stroganoff.  My friends even said it smelled awesome and I was nice and shared!  It was a HUGE pasta plate full of yummy egg noodles with tender pieces of beef, and a nice thick caramelized brownish mushroom/onion au jus reduction sauce with a bit of cream...perfect for me!  It was garnished with fresh sugarsnap peas, carrots and one of their yummy rolls!  I ate it along with my friends and wiped up every last drop with the roll.  Definitely the best stroganoff I have ever had in a restaurant!    I will definitely be back for a drink here; the mixologists are wonderful (so good, I can't even call them bartenders).  The menu prices are steep, so I would probably only come here on a special occasion for the food.  But, I must say this would be a great date spot or a place for visitors from out of town because the views of Camelback Mountain and the surrounding neighborhood/architecture are beautiful.",

I called around to several places, and on a saturday night, I was looking at 90 minutes or longer.    A different friend suggested El Chorro and I was able make a reservation for 8pm.  The atmosphere is sensational. We sat on the outdoor patio overlooking Camelback Mountain.  Our server Vicky (or Veronica?) was terrific and really made it a fun evening for us.  I highly recommend the Trout Almondine; it's one of their signature dishes and it is to die for!",

We decided to go for happy hour on a tuesday night and they place was not busy at all, which is totally fine by me. The appetizers and happy hour drinks specials were so well priced we decided to try quite a few things on the menu. The fish tacos were quite possibly the best I had ever had, as well as the sliders. The tuna poke was also incredible. We did get the lightly battered and fried shrimp and calamari, the dipping sauce was good which helped the slightly chewy seafood. I'm picky when it comes to margaritas, and they margs here were spectacular! Our server, Christina seemed very experienced and natural. We ended getting the sticky buns to take home, but they were a little too sweet for me . Over all this place had a terrific ambiance. Be prepared that you may not get to enjoy the beautiful sunset view if you go for happy hour because they have specific seating for happy hour dining. Love!",

Happy hour guests are now confined to one community table , which seats about 10, or the bar.  One cannot sit at the numerous tables on the patio, which the whole reason for coming here.  One can sit at the bar at any restaurant, so there is no reason to come here to do that.    We decided to leave El Chorro and go to The Vig, which has an excellent happy hour.  We enjoyed it!",

They did not disappoint!  Additionally, there was a little butter croissant in the basket which was also delicious.   Things went downhill from there. We ordered the banana pancakes and the huevos rancheros. The pancakes were standard issue. Nothing special. The huevos rancheros were trying to be fancy but fell flat. Also they had cilantro in them and I hate cilantro.   Also the table next to us tried to order the Denver omelet without the ham but were told \"sorry no modifications\". Really???!  Who does that?  That's just bad policy and customer service.   Won't be going back.",

This was our second time visiting El Chorro and this special event was for my sisters 40th birthday. The first time we ate here wasn't great, the food tasted a bit old and my husband was ill afterwards. But since it's such a pretty spot we thought we'd try again. BIG MISTAKE. The food arrived minutes after ordering and tasted like it had been sitting around and warmed up when we ordered it. Our reservation was for 8pm and by 10pm we could see the place was pretty empty. If it wasn't clear to us already we knew it was time to go when one of the staff \"accidentally\" propped the back door open right by our table. It was a very cold night and we all stood up immediately to put our coats on.  This was completely inappropriate and passive aggressive. To be rushed out of a restaurant after two and a half hours is despicable especially when El Chorro is supposed to be \"fine dining\". We will never support this restaurant again! Save your money and buy sticky buns from Trader Joe's instead!",

    "text": "Tucked away in the beautiful Camelback Mountains, El Chorro has become somewhat of an institution and favorite of Paradise Valley residents. Operating as a restaurant since 1937, it's garnered a long-standing reputation for a spectacular atmosphere, high-end dining, and even a popular wedding ceremony location. And after reading many of their Yelp reviews, I expected nothing but great things.    My girlfriend and I were able to be squeezed in for a Saturday night reservation on three hours notice and were absolutely starving by the time we were promptly seated at 8:30pm. The patio itself is gorgeous. On this particularly chilly evening, we were seated directly next to a small gas-fire pit.  Honestly, I'm not entirely sure what went wrong. Maybe it was an off-night with the servers and kitchen staff. Perhaps we were just extending our current run of bad luck with new places. Or, dare I say, maybe this acclaimed little establishment isn't quite what it's all cracked up to be.  Our original (male) server asked us if this was our first time visiting, which we stated that it was. Not that it mattered. He rattled off the daily special and gave us time to decide. After having some time to decipher the menu, a new (female) server came to us and we placed our order.    We decided to start with their Tuscan kale and arugula salad, which was pretty decent. Containing dried cranberries, almonds, red onion, feta, and a lemon honey thyme vinaigrette, the combination worked quite well together. Unfortunately, it was the only thing brought to our table that was worth a damn.  I ordered a medium-cooked filet with bearnaise sauce, while my girlfriend opted for the fire roasted jumbo tequila shrimp. This is, more or less, when things quickly went downhill.    As soon as I bit into my steak, I was taken back by the fact that it was barely even warm. My scalloped potatoes and vegetables suffered the same fate, tasting as if they had been sitting on the counter for far too long. The bearnaise sauce, which was cold, did nothing to help my quest for hot food. I insisted my girlfriend taste my steak, in order to see if maybe I'm just nit-picking for the sake of nit-picking. Sadly, she wholeheartedly agreed with my impressions. As another reviewer points out, I've had better (and cheaper) steak at chain restaurants, which is quite embarrassing to actually admit to considering my intense hatred for chains.  My girlfriend's shrimp, which I also tried, was really no different. Barely passing as lukewarm, it was very hard to make a judgment about its flavor due to the fact that it was cold. I'm guessing the server, who rarely came by to check on us, was distracted and let our food sit out for far too long. What's funny is that in all of our restaurant adventures over the years, there are very few instances where cold food is an issue.  The question is: Do we say something? By this point, it was 9pm and we were both hungry and agitated. Do we really want to wait another 30 minutes for them to remake the food or take it back into the kitchen and nuke it? We decided to just keep quiet.  Looking over at tables next to me, I was a bit confused to see people receiving baskets of their famed sticky buns before being served their actual entrees. I assumed the sticky buns were something they'd bring us for dessert. Another table had a giant basket of bread to boot, so I'm not entirely sure how they pulled that one off.      My Diet Coke was never refilled, despite letting it sit at the edge of the table for a good thirty minutes. I'm guessing they're accustomed to people blowing money on self-serving bottles of wine and champagne. Not everyone drinks, you know?   When our server finally came back and inquired our interest about their two dessert options, I just said we'll just have the sticky buns. Seriously, people, I don't get it. They're basically just cinnamon rolls - no different than the rolls that you can acquire at any supermarket or bakery. It was only later, after reading reviews, that I discovered that sticky buns are supposed to be brought out BEFORE your meal - not at the end! It's kind of their trademark, as many reviewers mention that it's the very first thing they (unexpectedly) receive. What's sad is that, if I didn't say something, we would've gotten the snub. You'd think if they've had one procedure properly in place, it would be knowing when to serve the item that they're most acclaimed for.  I've said time and time again, if your food sucks and your service is lackluster, then your ambiance, no matter how much people may brag about it, suddenly becomes irrelevant.  Sorry, El Chorro. We know what it takes to operate a four/five star restaurant, and it takes a bit more than a pretty patio with mountain views to achieve that rating.  I see this place as nothing more than a waste of money and a waste of time. Not recommended.",

    "text": "We went for Father's Date as this was my husband's favorite place to brunch.  He loves the atmosphere, the view, the sticky buns, and the Bloody Marys.  We went with our daughter, son in law, and grandson.  Unfortunately, we were not totally happy with the service and the waiter, or the food.  The waiter seemed to be \"hung over\" as he didn't have much of a personality and didn't seem to really want to be there.      My husband ordered the special $6 Bloody Mary but didn't really like it.  He loves the one with the giant prawn in it and if he was offered that option, he would have certainly had that.  There was no mention that the bloody mary would not have the prawn from the waiter, but we should have expected no prawn since the price was cheaper than normal.   I had a glass of Veuve Clicquot after asking for the champagne/wine menu.  The waiter brought it over but there were very few bubbles and seemed flat.  At $15 a glass, one would expect lots of bubbles.  It seemed the bottle was left over from the night below.  We sent that back and another glass of champagne was brought out which was more fitting.    My smoked salmon was tasty and wonderful, as usual.  Hubby and son in law got the special benedict with crab and filet tenderloin.  I didn't ask my son in law if he enjoyed his meal, but my husband said he should have order the regular eggs benefit as the beef was dry and tasteless.  Our daughter had a bagel with cream cheese and avocado which she was very happy with.  Maybe because it was Father's Day, the food, drinks, and waiter were \"off\".  Because we enjoy the El Chorro Lodge, we will be back, but probably not for any special occasion.  One positive was the woman who was refilling the water glasses (blonde, glasses).  She was very nice and personable and engaged our grandson in conversation.  We all agreed that we would have loved to have her as our wait person instead of the one we had.",

The quality of service is one aspect of running a restaurant and reflects upon the business. There are many restaurants in the valley that will treat you well. I have hopes that a realistic review will return the restaurant to a wonderful place to dine. Rather than a negative review.",

Nate, our server, took excellent care of us and his advice on appetizers (Shrimp pot!) and cocktails was spot on. The Moscow Mule they served is also delicious! I'd absolutely recommend El Chorro for any group looking for a picturesque setting to accompany a quality dining experience.",

We are only allowed to sit in certain places,  not allowed to push tables together, not allowed to move chairs to a table to accommodate more people at our table. The staff are rude and unhelpful. I was  not allowed to have salt on my skinny margherita. The mountain of rules leaves me cold and feeling as though I am a naughty child in school. Sad that they ruin a pretty place with lousy staff and ALL the rules!",

Decided to try out El Chorro for brunch and was pleasantly surprised by the awesome patio we were able to experience.  The weather was awesome, so it really added to the experience.  Thanks to a reservation, we were sat immediately.  Service was great, our waiter was friendly and helpful... so nothing to complain about there.  I had the tenderloin eggs benedict and the Hubs for the chicken enchilada with egg on top (basically huevos rancheros).  We both also partook in the mimosa.  I really enjoyed my eggs benedict and opted for the half portion.  This was just enough food for me, but I could see it being not enough for most people.  At $18 I really felt gipped.  The Hubs liked his meal, but decided at the end he really wasn't in the mood for what he ordered... would have preferred the enormous breakfast burrito we saw walk by.  At $60 bucks for our breakfast we both walked away feeling a bit disappointed.  The sticky bun is just as fabulous and people say it is, but that and the scenery don't make up for the expensive price tag in my book.  I'm really glad we experienced this gem of a location and of course the sticky bun, I only wish it wasn't so darn expensive...",

My wife's trout was inedible with greasy potatoes,  my stroganoff had tons of noodles, almost no beef and was cold.  My draft beer was luke warm.  The space is a five,  the food is a minus five, so I guess a one is the only choice. Why would anyone waste this great place to serve such below average food? Get a chef who is not lazy and serve a better than average menu and fare. Also, at your prices, bring back the relish dish. By the way, we had an 8:00 reservation and were not seated til almost 8:30, Cooling our heels in the lobby.",

This place is kind of on a island not much going around here but I will say the view. Building and location are beautiful. Of course if you come here everything on the menu is 30 to 40 dollars per item expected . They do ask you soup or salad so remember that extra add cost. But they do offer free sticky buns with every meal and they are very good. Now the salad of the day was , \"fresh and wonderful\" occurring to the table . I got the clam chowder but I'm to happy with the asking if there was no bacon and bingo there  is bacon. The staff did seem a little busy serving so maybe he was in a rush but I feel minus the bacon the soup was okay. Now on to the main course.  Seafood Pasta was okay just okay. I expected a little bit more but it came out pretty and sauce was good but the lobster was tough man. The chicken plate was just not my cup of tea but rib stack with cheese potato was amazing . Best thing on the table. I have to admit I was excited for the meal but if you have the ability to drive there are better pasta opinions but the ribs were worth the tasting . I would recommend the beef stack ribs , if I had that for my meal, I would be very pleased. If you are able to drive I wouldn't make the trip. But if you want a nice date or group area to relax and drink, this could be nice. It's quite the set up. O i forgot they gave my grandma a happy birthday desert which was a sweet for her but the rest of group that eats chocolate seem to of liked it.",

The bus boys and girls did a great job of keeping the waters and other beverages filled. Speaking of other beverages, the margaritas here are really delicious. Definitely recommended. There was a prix fixe menu for restaurant week which some partook of... the food sounded amazing but I wanted to eat light, so I got a salad instead, which was very tasty. The desserts looked awesome too, but again, didn't want an upset stomach on business travel, hah. I would probably come back here if I lived in the area, but I think if I am visiting again I'd want to try other places just to try them all out. Sitting outdoors was nice, btw, but I got chewed up by mosquitoes. D: (they have mosquitoes in Arizona?!) didn't help hearing about scorpions, snakes, and javelinas...I was turning around to look in the brush behind me the entire time to see if anything was going to jump out at me, Lmao!! Fun place to visit, though... and have not had as good a margarita back home!! But yeah desert wildlife, LOL.... not sure I'd be cut out for living the AZ life so to speak. But I digress!!

Hmm, sticky buns might be a tradition but the historic Wigwam had a basket of diverse muffins, with blue corn and jalepenos. Pardon the comparisons but the historic lodge only has a few peers in the valley. Kudos to the landscaping designers for the desert compacted soils for overflow parking; their commitment to a natural setting is also evident with the electric recharging stations!  More about the food: the vegetarian meal has great flavors and the salads are huge standouts: the heirloom tomatoes and hand pulled burrata salad are perfect.  Overall, the menu comes with large doses of carbs (scalloped potatoes, risotto.) Beau enjoyed the pork tenderloin.  Enjoy your drink at the bar with a nice oversized wine glass in lieu of a modest glass stem on the table. Dining room tables are a bit too tight to enjoy the desert view and ambience.   Recommendation: Check out bar & happy hour eats before committing to dinner.",

I had not been in several years so wanted to check out the renovations, menu, etc. We arrived at 4:30 and sat at a table on the patio. We didn't see a server so, after several minutes, I went to the bar and asked for one. When our server finally arrived, she didn't smile and welcome us, was very short when we asked questions, and just frankly had a very snooty attitude. When our drinks didn't arrive in a reasonable amount of time, I went back to the bar to cancel our order, but she was just getting ready to deliver them so we stayed. Again, no warmth or friendliness or apology for the wait. So we asked for the check and went to Sanctuary on Camelback Mountain. Had a wonderful night with outstanding service. Unfortunately, we won't be returning to El Chorro...too many other great options that will provide good service without an attitude.",

Their happy hour is awesome. $2.00 beers, killer tacos, a great burger. I think we spent $25 for the both of us to eat dinner and have a few drinks. It's a great place to take a date or have a romantic night. We are definitely going back.",

I tried to reserve the fireplace area below the TV on the back, inside patio for 15 people for happy hour, where we have sat before many times.  They said that was for dinner only.  How can you eat dinner without a table?  They said they don't take reservations for happy hour, and that is fine but they wouldn't even let us sit out there?  It was completely empty when looking at it when leaving.    We were lucky enough to get one table large enough for us all to sit at inside near the bar area.  The manager and waitress were very rude to our party and told us we cannot save the seats at our table for our group that was coming.  They sent others there to sit with us but when the others realized that we were all one group and had more people come in without a seat, they left and expressed their opinion on how management handled that, which wasn't good.  The manager told my friend that he didn't care if we all came back or not and the waitress told me, after we received one check for 16 people, including a 20% gratuity which wasn't deserved, that she didn't care how many other places accommodated us for separate checks, they don't!  Since when?  They always did.  It is unfortunate as I said because we all loved going here regularly, including Thanksgiving eve, and were always able to sit outside around the fireplace, and always received our own checks for what we separately ordered.  What happened to this place?  Is there a new owner, or new management?  Very unprofessional staff and not accommodating at all!",

Our reservation for 4 was honored promptly and we were seated in a lovely corner table near a glowing fireplace. Once we settled in, our waiter Phil let us know specials of the day and took drink orders. He then brought us fresh cinnamon rolls hot from the oven -which were so good they easily could have been dessert.   Upon looking at the menu we admit to thinking it was pretty boring. Wrong. The choices may have been somewhat traditional, but the presentation and taste were extraordinary.   Shared salads - wedge and Caesar - were ample and had their own twists to preparation. Each couple coincidentally ordered the same entrees, trout and salmon. It was so beautiful that I wish I had taken a photo of my salmon dish. The fish was perfectly cooked and served with a ginger soy sauce on a bed of black quinoa and braised baby bok choy. The trout was served with green beans almandine and roasted potatoes. We also ordered a side of lobster mac and cheese for the table. All dishes were phenomenal.   Then came dessert. We shared freshly baked apple pie a la mode and key lime pie, both fabulous.  However, as good as the meal was it was our waiter Phil who helped to take it over the top. Beyond his excellent and attentive service, he had the ability to let us leisurely enjoy our conversations, and know when to step in if we needed anything - and even absconding with the very last piece of key lime pie for us after being told it was sold out!   It's no wonder this place has a deserved stellar reputation.",

I'm only giving this star rating so that some consistent problem areas might get fixed:  The food runners at the bar just abruptly \"drop\" your food (sometimes you appetizer and dinner within within minutes) and, if you ask for something like a condiment, it's unlikely you'll get it from the food runner. It's also difficult to make eye contact with people behind the bar to ask for what you need, so we usually just figure \"do we eat the food hot, or do we wait to get what we need and eat it cold.\"  Also, I don't know whey this happens, but the bar runners put trays of dirty dishes on the counters or just below the counters where you can see them while you are eating, and by  mid-evening, they are much more interested in inventory and closing up than seeing if you need anything. The bar has gotten much better than it was a few years ago, but still needs help, and it would be terrific if these issues were fixed.",

    "text": "Last week our daughter had her wedding at El Chorro Lodge and the team at El Chorro, led by Lindsey Rendon, did a fantastic job.  The meal began with a crunchy salad and the famous sticky buns.  Guests had a choice of Center Cut Filet, Herb Roasted Chicken or a Polenta and Vegetable Napoleon - all were delicious.  The service was smooth and unobtrusive which was appreciated as there were speeches, songs and toasts.    One of the nicest touches was the care they gave to the bride and groom by assigning a staff member to take care of them from the time the service ended then throughout the evening.  This special person brought them drinks and appetizers while they took photos with friends and family and continued the great service through dinner and dancing.    The venue itself was beautiful.  The ceremony took place outside on the lawn overlooking Camelback Mountain, followed by a cocktail hour on the patio, then on to the reception room.    A very warm and sincere thank you to Linsey and the El Chorro team.  Signed a very happy MOB.",

Anytime we have friends or family in town this is where we take them and the meal and experience always get praises. My favorite items here are the braised short ribs and also the beet salad. I highly recommend and definitely suggest you ask to sit on the patio!",

    "text": "I was at El Chorro for a wedding rehearsal dinner so my review is based on their private dining services and not the normal dining experience.  Upon driving up to the restaurant there is a professional valet that quickly and efficiently gets you out of your car and on your way to a culinary adventure.    Our wedding party had a large private room off to the left of the main restaurant.  While walking over (on a hot and humid day) I noticed several huge mobile air conditioning units to cool the customers on the patio.  I was impressed by them because it's a thoughtful gesture that I haven't seen in many places.  These weren't the cheap (worthless) models.  They were some serious industrial A.C. units and they felt great.  The area we had was pretty secluded and private (away from the regular restaurant).  It had a great patio for cocktail hour.  The service was friendly and professional.  They were quick with drinks and quick to clean up empty glasses.  The dinner itself was magnificent.  We had a party of ~ 40 people but the service and the food was that of a quaint 5 star dining experience.  The deserts were so good I feared a massive sugar buzz so I had to contain myself (see my uploaded photos).  Overall, it was a 5 star experience.  If anyone is considering having a private dinner here (wedding or otherwise) I'd highly recommend it.  Fantastic!",

Our server Stephen was great... he helped point us in the right direction from start to finish. Our favorite's were the Shrimp Pepper Pot and the Trout Almandine. Also, the glass of Rombauer Chardonnay Stephen recommended paired perfectly. Great experience overall.",

    "text": "I honestly have to say we were so looking forward to our dining experience at El Chorro. We had a special family/friends dinner planned for a few weeks now and couldn't think of a prettier locale this time of year than El Chorro  We started by ordering 2 glasses of wine a Cab and a Zin. The Zin tasted a little off and we asked to switch it to another glass of Cab.  For appetizers we ordered 1 Caesar salad to split, a Burrata Salad, 2 cups of lobster corn bisque and 1 bowl of lobster corn bisque.  The soups arrived lukewarm, the burrata salad advertised w/ crostini, it came with none  We asked for the waiter....no one came. I got up to find the manager who said she would send someone right over. She also offered us a free drink or dessert  We just wanted service. Not looking for a freebie.  The soups were taken away and brought back not much warmer than the start minus the soup spoons.  The side of crostini for the salad never came The entrees were now being served.... still no crostini after asking numerous times.  We ordered 1 more glass of Cab to share.... the new waiter didn't know which one we were drinking and took it upon himself to bring us a more expensive glass.  When the bill came we were charged for 4 glasses of Cab not 3 and for 2 Caesar Salads (not split) Brought this to the waiters attention.  He said he would correct the bill and split in 2  When he came back he brought us another parties bill... which was significantly less.  We pointed this out... and he brought us our bill. We gave him our  2 cc's   He brought the bills back charged to the wrong cc's  We finally had to get the manager involved again She offered us a discount and said she would have to adjust each bill. She was now at a point of frustration and taking it out on our party. One member of our party said we should have paid the 'cheaper' bill and left.  This mess is not our fault. The manager said to our guest 'I'm proud of you' That was incredibly rude. She became extremely unpleasant and accusatory   We weren't looking for a comp, a discount or a free dessert. We wanted a nice evening out. We wanted impeccable service   El Chorro was such a disappointment  We have been coming here since the 50's.  We understand progress, price increases. Etc  We don't understand rude, accusatory, nasty, and condescending.  It made for a very unpleasant evening.",

My shrimp were over cooked and the crab cakes were thin. Presentation was nice. Service was friendly and prompt, but I'm not sure if they knew their menu and wines well enough to make good recommendations. Big selection of California wines on the menu. I hear the bar seating and happy menu are great. That's probably where you'll get more bang for your buck.",

It is definately pricier than it used to be under old ownership - pre-remodel, but it is absolutely lovely, the food is above average (not the best for the prices imo) the view is stunning. The service is on point - just enough not too much. We were celebrating our anniversary and they brought us a lovely dessert. Also, hostess called us the day after to thank us for our visit and inquire about our experience. Really nice touch - so easy for a restaurant to do this and go the extra mile, but really no one does anymore. Kudos to the service team.",

    "text": "Amazing patios and service... Meh food  Visited for the holiday and was stoked about eating at El Chorro. After hearing of its long history, quality food, and sticky buns, my expectations were very high.   First, the restaurant has an amazing design-- tons of patio spaces with fireplaces, a semi-private grass yard, old-style rooms with all modern amenities, and all while preserving the historic nature and charm. The western theme prevails through the renovated touches.   Second, the service was top-notch at every turn. We arrived early and they were able to seat us nonetheless. Vicki quickly visited us, took orders, and started to check on us frequently and with an earnest joy. Supporting cast and the waiter from the next table were just as gracious.  Ah, but the food... Our party covered the menu: Lobster Bisque, Arugula Salad, Shrimp Cocktail, Scottish Salmon, Beef Tenderloin, Organic Turkey, Peach Cobbler, and Cheesecake. To the person, all said things were flat on taste. Aside from the sticky buns, nothing stood out. The Bisque was bitter from the sherry used. Salad was par. Shrimp cocktail were well-sized, but standard fare and sauce. The salmon had quality and a great cook's touch on its side, yet left two in our party perplexed by the off pairing with a corn succotash. Two others thought the tenderloin was a great cut undermined by being too raw and being paired with a forgettable gratin potato and completely bland creamed spinach that tasted little like their ingredients. Last, the cheesecake and cobbler were so dull that not a single person of six finished their dessert. And our family craves desserts like Frosty the Snowman likes magic hats!  I'd love to score El Chorro higher. All the pieces are there, except the food. And since it's a restaurant, that's too important to disregard.",

It wasn't crazy busy so don't know why it took 15 minutes for the bartender to serve us.  I was then watching the bartender pouring drinks. At one point, he poured maybe a half shot of vodka into a glass and the bottle was empty. Instead of opening another bottle, he shorted whoever ordered that drink.  The final thing that made me realize this place was a rip off was when I was handed the bill for two drinks at the bar is that they unilaterally charged gratuity. I would NOT have given him that amount because I was not happy with the service. Will never go back.",

If you want to impress people from out of town, let them stroll around the grounds, take a seat in front of camelback mountain, and eat a sticky bun. In fact, just eat four thousand sticky buns. They're the best. For me, it's like a basket of sticky buns and eggs and the view. You don't need more than that.   In fact probably don't order more than that.   They used to be known for their eggs Benedict. I'm not so sure that's True anymore. My mother's dish came out cold, as did mine. I know this was not the server's fault. Joseph was lovely. He's like an uncle now. I will call him every Christmas.   But again. We really weren't there for the eggs. We were there because the weather was amazing and anytime is a good time for a sticky bun. And the restaurant itself is a beautiful place. Great for people watching. And I'll mention the sticky buns one more time for good measure. Be sure to eat sixteen of them.

Really had the intentions to go to the gym this morning but decided to eat leftover sticky buns in bed instead.   My boyfriend and I went for AZ restaurant week and both ordered from the ARW menu. For the first course, we split the Caesar salad and the cheese course. We both wished the lettuce was chopped up but I understand it's for appearance. Instead of normal croutons, they used polenta croutons which I enjoyed but my boyfriend didn't.   For our main entrees, I went with the halibut dish that came with jasmine rice and bok choy. It was a very simple dish. I liked it but nothing about it stood out. My boyfriend ordered the center cut filet. He really liked the peppercorn sauce and it was nicely put together. I remember him saying it was a great cut of steak.   For our final courses, we decided to take them to go because we were so stuffed. We took home the strawberry shortcake and the Chocolate cake. I wish we actually looked at the description or had our server tell us about the desserts. He listed our options but never mentioned anything about them. I was expecting a fluffy light strawberry shortcake with Angel food cake. Or maybe cake-like with pound cake, but when we got home, we found out it was just a biscuit cut in half horizontally with whipped cream and strawberry puree. Not really all that great to he honest. The chocolate cake is still in our fridge but I'll dig into it later tonight. No way anyone can screw it up right? It's chocolate cake!  Service was just average, nothing really to complain about. The drinks did take quite awhile but the server apologized each time. I enjoyed it the first few times we came so it will still be on our list of places to grab dinner or brunch.",

    "text": "For our last night in Arizona and family obligations over I figured it would be a good opportunity to take my wife to an outstanding restaurant.  I made reservations three days in advance on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOpenTable.com&s=c91bdbc3a0ec574526e58696cba3aeccf3c9f0bf51b27a302b229c80b40f42ac\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">OpenTable.com</a> and they actually called me the day before to confirm and check whether we wanted indoor or outdoor seating.  Since it had been so cold the last few days we were there we opted for indoor dining.  A little history about El Chorro.  The main building was an old grammar school.  They added on the courtyard, dining area and gardens when it became a restaurant.  It includes their own garden for herbs, produce for the chef.  It also includes several outdoor fireplaces and a bocce court.  For an appetizer, we started out with a small cheese plate which consisted of parmesan, provolone, bleu cheese & brie with cranberries, dried apricots and candied walnuts.    While we were working on our appetizer out came the famous sticky buns.  They are delicious, not too sweet and definitely worth trying.  For entrees, we ordered the Niman Ranch Pork Tenderloin and the Pan Roasted Duck Breast.  The pork tenderloin came with green chili risotto and butternut squash.  The Duck came with celery root mashed potatoes, pearl onions, brussel sprouts with a pomegranate reduction.  Both were tender and delicious.  Even though having tried Duck previously and not really being a big fan I have to say the duck here was done perfectly and not as fatty as my previous tries.  For dessert, we split a piece of their vanilla cake with carmel sauce garnished with a blackberry and cappuccinos (they were very strong but not bitter as some can be).  This was a perfect way to end our stay in Arizona.  You cannot beat the views.  Next time maybe we will be able to do a weekend brunch and sit outside to enjoy the fabulous views.  On a side note, they even called me the next day to thank me for patronizing their restaurant.  I was very impressed.",

It was enough for the three of us to enjoy a small portion. The patio area is exquisite.  My only complaint is that the last two times we've been forced to sit outside as the inside filled up. This time, I had inside seating but we were booted by a client that reserved the entire inside at the last moment (our guess is that it was a very windy evening, so they switched to inside seating rather than take a chance outside). As it turned out, the winds were not bad and we enjoyed the patio but the restaurant really shouldn't alter seating on a Friday night at the last minute. El Charro, its wait staff and the food, are all 5s if not for the snafus we've had twice with our reservations. We will return for sure and hope for a different reservation experience.  (the warn sticky buns they serve before the meal are a real treat, although they don't really go with the dinners, but imagine more of a very old tradition, which is cool)",

    "text": "Dinner last week - we shared the burrata salad and vegetable Napoleon.  The tomatoes on the salad were hard and flavorless, yet the cheese was fantastic!  Veggie dish: Polenta was cooked perfectly, actually had a creamy texture vs. the typical grainy/corn texture.  Very filling and lovely.  Made a mistake of ordering a decaf Irish coffee -- far from the Buena Vista in SF!  They used whip cream from a can and first time out the coffee arrived lukewarm.   Nice wine list - enjoyed the Etude Pinot Noir.    We ate at the bar and servers were generally attentive.  Overall I would give the experience a 3.5 (I know - not available).  A four is too generous given the tomatoes and Irish coffee.",

I ordered a sandwich with a side of mayonnaise and it must have been from the night before. it had congealed and there was ketchup on the bottom of the bowl (like it had been taken off someones plate and reused) ... It was nasty and did not spread. Once we complained to the waitress we were comped my sandwich but no other apologies made... We spent over $90.00 for 2 adults and 3 children for a Sunday morning brunch (which included 1 mimosa.) Wow... $4 Orange Juices and $10.00 chicken tenders. Don't waste your money unless you are just trying to find a restaurant with a good view.",

    "text": "We went to El Chorro Lodge for brunch the other day and what a wonderful experience we had. There are a lot of reviews already written about this Arizona landmark restaurant so here's another review to consider if you're thinking about trying El Chorro Lodge.  Restaurant ~ they have one of the best dining patio's in the metro!  Great views of the desert and mountains, everything is shaded with umbrella's and they have the misters going full throttle this time of year.  There is usually some light entertainment in the evenings on the patio.  The restaurant is somewhat a \"mission style\" clean lines, exposed ceiling rafters and white walls with some nice art work.  It's smaller inside than what most people might think, so you will most definitely want to use Open Table or call them to make reservations before going.    Service ~ good servers here. Most of them are very attentive to your needs and very accommodating.  There were a few times we saw some of the servers blast past customers without a \"pardon me\" while going to and fro to the patio.   Food ~ WARNING, eater's discretion is advised here!  Yes they serve you  sticky buns throughout the day and they are sooooo good and very addictive!  You'll want to order more but dont!  It will spoil you appetite before you get your main course.  These tasty little buns or goodness will swell in your tummy so just enjoy one (or two) that way you'll have something to look forward to on your next visit.    On this last visit I had smoked salmon omelet with goat cheese, capers and some other goodies.  It was awesome!  It came with a side of hash brown potatoes and toast.  We also had their Creme Brulee french toast and ordered a side of bacon.  This sounded much better than what it tasted.  They use thick challah bread that must soak for a very long time, for this french toast tasted more like and eggie bread pudding.  The apple wood bacon was slightly over cooked but still tasty.  We also had their  eggs benedict which was delish.  You have your choice of proteins with your EB ~ canadian bacon, smoked salmon, lump crab or beef tenderloin and served with asparagus.    El Chorro Lodge has a great ambiance, good food and service.  It is what we expected most of the restaurants would be like prior to moving to Phoenix.  This is a great place to go with friends and family.  I recommend dining on their patio for brunch or a late dinner.  Hope to see you there sometime!",

A short wait at the bar and we were seated on the patio and had a great server.  We had short ribs, seafood pasta and trout almondine with mussels for an appetizer. The seafood pasta and mussels were a bit overkill on seafood, but I am a seafood lover and loved it all.   The new Paradise Valley member of our group (fresh out of college) loved it as well as us older folks and plans to return as soon as she can. All and all a wonderful evening out. We have added it to our must visit in Phoenix list.",

    "text": "El Chorro has been in the valley for decades. This is where the wealthy old tourists and snow birds dine for a good meal in a beautiful setting.  The patio is wonderful, very old west/desert sky elegant. The drink menu is creative and original and changes frequently.  We ate here with a group of 9 and they were able to accommodate us easily. The watermelon gaspacho was interesting and flavorful and spicy. The steak was cooked near perfect for my taste and the au gratin potatoes were off the hook.  The wine list is expansive, many bottles in the $40+ range all the way up to several hundred dollars.  The service, while attentive, is very casual. Don't expect starched shirts and formalities.  The clientele as I stated is typically older, our table by far was the youngest in the restaurant with mostly 40 somethings and a few 30 somethings. Expect a lot of Tommy Bahama shirts and Rush Limbaugh conversations.  We dine here once a year or so due to the ambiance and good food. It is rather expensive so we like to keep it as a treat.  You can't really go wrong here for a nice meal.",

    "text": "This review has to be broken into the tale of two worlds - happy hour and dinner.  First review will be our experience in the bar for Happy Hour and the Second in the dark, dark world of the outdoor dinner seating.  We valet parked our car without a care in the world. It was my wife's birthday so we thought we'd get to the restaurant early and enjoy the happy hour in the bar. Rachel was an absolutely lovely waitress. Our cocktails (party of five) and appetizers were simply a very warm, inviting, and lovely experience. The arisan cheese plate was enjoyable along with the grilled sausage trio. The happy hour buffet that is advertised simply didn't exist. Cocktails beyond their house pours were overpriced as expected.   Overall the experience was very nice and I'd return for this portion of the evening. (but, you might want to read my review of the dinner experience).  ---  After a lovely experience in the bar for happy hour (separate review) we were seated in the outdoor dining area (no one \"got\" us as we requested when our reservation was ready, and they didn't come to our table but asked us to come up to the hostess stand - no big deal but a bit tacky and awkward for all).   (This is very sad as we're Phoenicians for 25 years and have experienced this restaurant over the years)  Our waiter, Eric, didn't seem to want to be there or make our experience better in any way. Eric seemed to have had a bad day and so would our table of five along with my wife, for her birthday celebration.   We ordered directly from the dinner menu as we had just enjoyed app's in the bar. It was obvious that Eric wasn't' pleased with this but he marched off and placed our orders.   Upon delivery (next time we saw Eric), all was just fine until I cut into my $44 strip steak. After some time, Eric stopped by and asked how dinner was. I showed him the steak and asked if it was medium. No, and he took it away. He came back and asked if I'd like another glass of Cab - well, no, unless your manager is buying so I might have it with the steak I ordered. Ten minutes later, when the rest of the table was about done with dinner, my steak was delivered. And, yes, it was cooked to a perfect medium (although, who's hungry after sitting that long and nibbling off everyone else's plates?).   How's my wife's Birthday going? Well, not real well. Did Eric bring the wine, dessert, or anything to enhance the experience? No. I spoke with Alec, the manager, and he simply could not have cared less. His eyes were glazed-over as I explained the experience and lack of response from his staff. Alec was truly the manager of a restaurant that I would never want to experience again. He didn't sympathize, apologize, or even care about me or my family.   DON'T GO HERE IF YOU WANT A GOOD EXPERIENCE! Spend your $ elsewhere.",

While I miss the funky decor of old Scottsdale, I like the updated version also!   We visited on a very chilly night and after a drink at the bar, my husband suggested we have our early dinner outside on the patio under all the heaters. I scoffed. It's really cold. The hostess suggested blankets. So she pulled out cozy blankets to cover our chilly laps! After sitting at our intimate table underneath the heaters, I really didn't need it and enjoyed the moonlit sky.  Our server was Andre and he was great! Attentive and friendly without being too chatty. My husband had the sea bass and I had the pork tenderloin. We also had the wedge salad. Sticky buns yummy as always! Our food was moist, delicious and perfectly cooked. Soooo happy! Only complaint was that our wedge salad (which Andre had divided into two for us) had too much dressing on it. Second complaint was that the food was so good, I overate. My pooch is sticking out as I write.  In our conversation, Andre mentioned that there was a new chef in the kitchen when we said how great our food was. Strongly recommend El Chorro.",

Older place but nice with some absolutely beautiful scenery if you sit in the right place on the patio. It got cold out there, and they put heat lamps on which really helped tremendously. Nice bartenders, too, but beware the drinks are somewhat pricey at $9 for a margarita which tasted like it came out of the Sauza bottled mix.   Had the $12 cheese platter which fed more than one of us as they give alot of cheese, crackers, nuts, dried cranberries on it.  That was a nice platter really. But, all in all, a nice place to go in Paradise Valley, and--when I find Mr. Adequate--we'll be going there as it's verrrrrry romantic in the evening as they turn very few lights on at the tables outside.  Muy romantico...kiss, kiss, kiss! As Ahnold says, \"I'll be back.\"",

We started with the recommended shrimp pepper pot.  It was delicious, but we both commented on how heavy the butter seemed in the dish, and how it could have been lightened up with a little olive oil.  The house salad was romaine lettuce with a sherry vinegarette.  Again, a more modern menu would probably use different greens.  Our entrees were huge - my prime rib was cooked nicely but lacked a little seasoning. My wife had the fish special: halibut in hollindaise sauce.  Again, huge portion, very rich.  Coffee was very watery and reminded me of dinners at grandmas house.  The patio is amazing with beautiful views. The menu a throwback to an earlier generation of \"fine dining.\" it was nostalgic to eat food like this, but i doubt we'll come back.",

I had an out of town guest and before they left, I thought to make an Open Table Brunch 9:15 reservation for a party of 4. Early because my guest had a flight to catch, but I have to say it was really nice, the brunch crowd wasn't there yet so it was very peaceful and very enjoyable. The service was excellent.  Of course we had classic brunch cocktails: Bloody Marys as we munched on their delectable Cinnamon Buns and assorted pastries while looking over the menu. Entrees ordered: Banana Pancakes (toasted macadamia Nutella fondue sauce), 3 Sausage Omelette, Green Chili Pork Stew, and Best of Both Worlds Egg Benedict (one benedict of each. Jumbo lump blue crab cake, tomato salsa hollandaise, petite filet, bearnaise sauce)  All the dishes were hot, fresh, and tasted wonderful. My out of town guest had the Eggs Benedict which looked absolutely amazing and he said it tasted fantastic.  Arizona Landmark with excellent service, Food: very good... just a great place for an early brunch!",

It was Monday night and Denise was training a new server. They worked together to make it a pleasant experience.   The food was well prepared, presented nicely and was delicious. Of course the atmosphere and ambiance of El Chorro is unique and a reminder of what great eating establishments can be if they stay True to their roots.",

Our server Mark was immediately welcoming and very friendly. He provided us with excellent service. He recommended a delicious bottle of wine which paired well with our dinner. We started with the tuna and crab dynamite appetizer, followed by salads. I had the tomato burrata salad and my husband had the caesar, both were very flavorful. For dinner, my husband ordered the lamb chops and said it was the best lamb he has had. I had the jumbo shrimp and grits which were flavored with cajun spices that they gladly adjusted to accommodate my spice tolerance. For dessert their fruit pie was apple which they warmed up for us to create apple pie a la mode. Overall it was great culinary experience and I am sure we will be back.",

It's gorgeous and even if the weather is warn their air units are fabulous. We had the greatest waiter we've ever had... Nate from Seattle. Ask for him. You won't regret it.  Atmosphere beautiful... this place has been in operation since 1937! Unbelievable! The food is outstanding! BUT have a discussion with your waiter because things can be creatively customized to match your tastes and preferences. My dish was no where on the menu or the specials list but it was one of the greatest dishes I've ever had. No one was disappointed and we all agree that if were ever back in Phoenix we're returning.",

Denise, our waitress, was very informative about El Chorro and gave us great information about the menu.  She was very attentive and made our two out of town guest so very comfortable.  Couldn't have been more pleased.  We had a variety of items from the menu: short ribs, beef stroganoff, flat iron steak, and sea bass.  All were wonderful and everyone raved  about which item was the best.  To top it off we're the sticky buns which were wonderful.  Ryan, the general manager, took time to stop by our table to ask about our meal which was very thoughtful.  Can't recommend El Chorro high enough.  Great for family, business, and out of town guests.

Decided to sit outside and it was nice - breezy, a little dark.. but that bodes well with the intimate/upscale feel of the area.   Our waiter was friendly and patient while we decided what we wanted to order. Decided on the crab cakes for our app, seafood pasta and short ribs for our entrees. There was a mix up with our app so we ended up being able to try the pepper pot shrimp as well, which was really delicious.  The food was FABULOUS - all the flavors were there and it was SO ENJOYABLE. The short ribs were cooked perfectly and melts in your mouth. Crab cakes and shrimp were super flavorful and rich as well.   Only small thing is the pasta seemed to be cooked similarly to the shrimp - felt like I was eating the same flavors.. just with noodles.   I guess it was the end of the night since our waiter brought out sticky buns for us, thank you!! They were a wonderful finish to our meal, although it's honestly a classier cinnamon roll.   And being that we were there pretty late/the last table, the restaurant promptly turned off the lights as soon as we paid.. not sure how I feel about that. Regardless, the food was worth it and done nearly to perfection.  This isn't a place to come weekly since it's so upscale, but this place is definitely a strong contender if you've never been/have something to celebrate, or just simply want to enjoy life!",

We had the trout almandine and the sea bass special. Both were very good.   Special shout out to the great service from Tristin. He knew the wine list, told us about the interesting history of the restaurant's buildings and even showed us around the grounds after we finished. He made the meal very enjoyable!

We got a spot on the patio which was absolutely stunning! We were seated right away and the staff there were very friendly. The restaurant is actually quite large and they have a lot of patio seating which I was surprised about.  The meal started with a lobster bisque which was delicious. They also brought out some sticky buns which was a little odd for the beginning of the meal but nonetheless they were good. My husband and I both got the fillet, I got mine with a crab cake and loved it. The steak, mashed potatoes, and asparagus were all really great however, I did not care for the spinach. Lastly, for dessert we got the tiramisu and strawberry shortcake which were delicious.  I would absolutely love to return here and try some of the other items on the menu and to enjoy the great ambience of the patio.",

    "text": "My cousin and I had dinner here last week and had a beautiful evening. I wanted to come to check out the beautiful grounds because I had a family photoshoot yesterday evening (12/28/18) I had spoken to someone over the phone earlier in the day (12/28/18 @ 10:45, I believe her name was Nicolette) She said there is a site fee for photography. She said since I was taking photos of a family who already had dinner reservations that the fee was waived, no site fee. She mentioned to check in with the hosts to let them know I was on the property taking photos.  I arrive at the beautiful El Chorro and walk right in to let the hosts know I'm here. They call the manager over who proceeds to tell me that I need to pay the $250-$500 site fee and that he has no reservation for me to take photos. He gets someone else who I believe his name was Tim. This is where I felt completely uncomfortable. He comes over to me and asks, \"who are you???\" I introduce myself and let him know what Nicolette told me on the phone. He accused me of lying and said \"that's a lie, this is a lie. There is a site fee you need to pay\". I kindly said I will tell the family who is waiting patiently outside that you're not allowing me to take the photos and we will leave. He then threatens me with \"oh no it's fine this time, but if you disturb any of the customers, I will ask you to leave and take your backpack away from you\" mind you, I have all of my camera equipment in my bag, so no one will be taking anything away from me. That would be considered theft. I said my thank you's and walked away from a very uncomfortable situation. The family and I walked over to the beautiful courtyard and took the photos. We didn't disturb any customers since we weren't anywhere near the restaurant anymore. I was SO excited to take photos here, but with the way I was treated, this place really doesn't care about anyone. If anyone is thinking of taking photos here, I would think again.",

Everyone really liked their food. The biggest hit was those awesome Bloody Mary drinks with the huge jumbo shrimp. Those were amazing!!  I was expecting a huge tab but actually it is a very reasonably priced brunch. If you know what to order. My friend sitting next to me got the French Toast which was a huge plate and she didn't finish half of it. My sister on the other side had the beet salad which was tiny! Since it was twelve dollars, about the price of many of the other meals, she expected it to be entree size but I would consider it small even for a starter. I had the breakfast tacos which were on the small side as well but very tasty.  Overall, I'd say that it's a great option for brunch and I really enjoyed it. I'd come back for sure just for that bread basket and cocktails.",

    "text": "I had my birthday dinner here a few months ago.  Oddly, the weather in March was warmer than it is now.  I digress.  Anyhow, beautiful patio!  Although I would have preferred to sit on the patio furthest from Lincoln, it was closed for a wedding.  Not sure if it's normally open for general seating, but I'm hoping so.  Because we can't help ourselves, we started with both the shrimp pepper pot and the cheese and charcuterie plate.  The shrimp was in a rich, spicy broth, and served with crusty bread.  Delicious and perfectly cooked.  The small-sized cheese and charcuterie was to serve 1-2.  We either got the large size in error or there are some big ass eaters out there.  And I'm one of them, so I can't imagine that this was the small.  But regardless, there was a nice variety of cheeses and meats with all the accoutrements one could need.  Then came the sticky buns.  Dang.  I forgot about those when we ordered two apps.  Ooey, gooey sticky goodness.  But eat them while they're hot.  Once they cool off, it's over.  I do wish these were served at the end of the meal though.  I felt like it was a dessert.  Not enough so that I wouldn't order dessert...that would be unthinkable.  By now, we could have skipped dinner, but I insisted and we opted to split an entree, the seafood pasta.  This is where the star comes off.  We opted to pay the up-charge to have them portion it for us.  You actually get more seafood that way.  But I would have preferred less in the end.  While the pasta and sauce were very good, every piece of seafood in the dish was overcooked...shrimp, scallops, lobster, etc.  For the price point, there's no excuse for that.  I almost took 2 stars off, but I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt that this was the exception.  But it was disappointing enough that while I will gladly return for drinks and appetizers, I'm in no hurry to actually have dinner.",

After being seated we ordered drinks, 25 minutes later and being told at least four times that my drink was coming, I find out they cannot make an Appletini and have to order something else. This was shortly followed by being served hard, Old tasting sticky buns, which was a major selling point for them. Still I reserved judgement, that was until I got my over-salted beef stroganoff and waited another 20 minutes for my second drink. After hearing that the experience was lacking, the server abruptly went to get the manager as if we had upset him in some way. The manager, Ryan then comes over to the table, pretends to listen and gives a generic  insincere apology accompanied by the gesture to make things right and ensure we finish having had a great experience. This by the way did not happen. He did nothing, no discount to the bill, gesture for a future visit or even something as small as dessert which would be a minimal offer after spending over $200. Overall this was a disappointing experience especially on what should have been an enjoyable and memorable day for my mother. Poor service was giving from the start and followed up with over promising and under delivering. Sad to say but I have removed El Chorro from the list of restaurants I would recommend. Note that I heard this restaurant is under new management which way be the reason why both quality and service have gone downhill. I have eaten here many times which is why this is even more disappointing",

He said we were talking so he didn't want to interrupt-  wow! Had to ask for the cinnamon rolls that they bring as bread before dinner.Food took forever to come. We were outside and had heaters but they were pointing  away from table so we asked for the heater s to be pointed at table. waiter said he look into it but never happened. Then on top of the bad service, because we were a party of six, there was an automatic 20% tip and they have the nerve to ask for additional tip. Why does a party of six take more work than three tables of two. This place is a snow birders trap. Second time we have had bad service and mediocre food. Won't be back and would recommend others avoid them",

    "text": "Not even sure where to begin on this horrendous experience. First off I was giving El Chorro a second chance as I last ate here a couple of years ago and did not have a great experience but that was nothing compared to last night  My girlfriend and I wanted to treat her kids to an \"iconic\" Phoenix dining spot with a patio as her daughter was home for spring break and she graduates from college in a few months. Needless to say we wanted this to be a special evening. Unfortunately it was quite the opposite.   After being seated we had to wait 20 minutes before our waiter even acknowledged us and then it was 45 minutes before we had cocktails served. We were not in a hurry and wanted to have a leisurely dinner but this was a bit much.   After appetizers and ordering a bottle of wine for dinner we waited over an hour for our meals and also had to order an additional bottle due to the long delay. In the meantime the table next to us who was seated after us had finished their meal and we're leaving.   By this time myself and my girlfriend were not only frustrated but embarrassed by the situation as we really wanted this to be a special evening.   We expressed our frustration to both the waiter and the manager who never once during the course of the evening stop by our table. To their credit they did comp part of our meal but that was not the point as the evening had already all but been ruined.   Then to top things off when the waiter dropped the bill off at the table he copped a whole lot of attitude about my being frustrated and stormed off.   Then this morning we realized that we had never even been offered the so called signature sticky buns which pretty much demonstrates how messed up they were last night.   Needless to say we will never be back and will certainly warn anyone not to as well.",

The menu selection for brunch is very nice, food quality is fantastic. I have had everything from the French toast to biscuits and gravy. Their yummy sticky buns are served in a basket of baked goodies before the meal. Service can be a little relaxed, but they are always busy, and that has never had a negative effect on our meals. The patio is lovely, views are gorgeous and I love that they grow their own herbs and veggies on the property.",

The staff is exceptional and service is simply what they do. If you go a couple of times they remember you, what you eat, what you drink, and where you like to sit. I love to go there for brunch on Sundays, and am comfortable going there alone.   They work very hard at preparing your food exactly the way you want it - and they should - because it is pretty pricey - but you are paying to be in that lovely setting eating it. I have nothing else good to say about the food, except for the sticky buns. They come with anything that you order, and they are delicious.  Go for the setting, enjoy the sticky buns and the excellent service, and don't give much thought to whatever else you are eating",

But the negative outweighed the positive for me:  There are no vegetarian dishes on the happy hour menu. The server did tell me there were vegetarian dishes on the main menu, but the only thing that looked vegetarian was the tomato  burrata salad I it was terrible and over-priced. El Chorro would do better to serve the traditional caprese salad. I did not eat the salad.  It was supposed to be served with crostini, but I never received that either. I did ask for some bread and the server acted like it was unusual but finally served me some old, hard sour dough bread. Definitely not going here again.  Sorry El Chorro, I found the service lacking and the food worse.",

    "text": "This legendary place is a beauty that is tucked up in Paradise Valley with an awe-striking view of Camelback Mountain. With history thru the 1930's the beauty of the mansion is magnificent. The patio is huge and I was excited that our group was able to sit outside without it being so hot and take in the beauty of the place and the mountain. We started off in the bar with happy hour. Loved the cheese plate. Loved the sausage plate too. It's ample and enough to share with one-to-three people as a sampling. The bar is busy. It was pretty much standing room only. I waited for the waitress to bring my house marg. when she forgot and reminded her a couple of times. Yet working in the service industry at 39k feet, I am forgiving and I get that! Meh. Wasn't a fan. Pass on the house marg that is priced way above what it should be. My boyfriend got the Pom Fire marg. a mix of margarita/pomegranite/jalepeno. He loved it; but was happy with just one before heading to his usual brew. I could not taste it, despite the desire to, as I am allergic to jalepenos. Bummer. I opted for the seasonal Strawberry Bliss drink and loved that one. It's a mixology of greatness containing champagne, mint sprigs, muddled strawberries and liquor. MMMMMMMM. Blissful.  Again know that these drinks aren't for the budget conscious. A happy hour drink that ranges from $9-13 is not exactly 'happy'.  Dinner we moved on to the patio. Live music provides an ambience as does the back drop of the mountain and lighting is just correct. Our picks for the night: Truffle fries.. Yum.;Filet 8 oz with Peppercorn. Heaven in my mouth.; Tenderloin Pork. Yum; Sticky Buns. Don't like sweets, but everyone raved over that gooeyness!; A bottle of Pinot Noir. Get ready . Dinner alone will set your wallet back over $250 smacks. Great service. Perfect setting for the desert. Awesome food. Steep price. That being said. You decide.",

Since then, we come here every once in a while to meet friends for drinks or to entertain people from out of town.  The Better Half and I enjoy the \"Southwestern\" decor and atmosphere here, but it's done in an upscale & classy way.  When we dine here, my fav menu items are:  9 oz Filet, $41 Truffle Fries, $7 Scalloped Potatoes, $7  I try not to come here when I'm super hungry because the Filet is only 9 oz.  It's very good and the portion is just right for a normal hunger level, but it's kind of small for a big appetite night.  The Truffle Fries are amazing and the Scalloped Potatoes are delish....but filling.  We enjoy sitting outside here.  They keep their exterior furniture very clean and it's comfortable, especially during the Fall & Spring.  The building & complex is huge....I guess they can do fairly large special events here.  The only special events I've attended here are business mixers or industry cocktail events....but I've heard it's fantastic for weddings, anniversaries, and reunions as well.  The service here is great.  Nice employees who are friendly and accommodating work here.  There's plenty of parking in the back or a valet service if you choose to use it up front.

The NY strip I had with a peppercorn sauce on the side was just one of the best steaks I've ever had.  The pork tenderloin is like no other pork dish anywhere.

Next we moved into the dining room and our table of choice was next to the fireplace. So cozy! We were all starving so we ordered another appetizer, the shrimp pepper pot. That definitely didn't disappoint! The shrimp was incredible! It reminded us of the mo rockin shrimp from eddies house. Delish! For dinner I tried the pork tenderloin and absolutely loved it! It was perfectly cooked and bursting with flavor. My man had chicken enchiladas and those were nice as well.

My first time here ever so cannot compare to the old and on a Wednesday didn't have a reservation so was seated in the bar patio with the bar menu. The cheese & charcuterie platter was fabulous but the steak & onion soup was the rogue menu addition and bad order choice (great steak but processed onion flavor).  ***Warning*** $15 Chopin martinis...but it was fabulous and so was the view. I could really learn to love $15 martinis here.... of course I can also imagine the valet bringing me back a Bugatti when I leave.   Eager to return for a main course or happy hour again...",

There was no silverware on the table, getting water was a challenge.  The plates were never cleared.  Asked several time for someone to take the plates.  How this place still draws a folllowing is beyond my understanding.",

I had the HH margarita and my hubby grey goose Cosmo - perfect.  By 4:30-4:45 the bar was full.  We decided not to order off HH menu although everyone around us did and it all looked great.  We had the pepper pot shrimp - so delicious! I wasn't sure about the beer broth when we ordered but such a nice compliment and the dipping bread...yum!  We also tried the flash fried lobster with drawn butter (not needed) but the aioli was great and the batter was so light it did not take away from the lobster.  Our bartender Jason was so great very attentive but did not rush.  Our experience had gone so well we felt we needed to stay for dinner.  We shared the filet cooked at medium as ordered which came with a portion of scalloped potatoes and brocollini, lobster Mac and cheese - good, and the steamed spinach.  Everything tasted SO good.  Overall it couldn't have been better.  You would never have known they were hosting a wedding and 3 other events last night.  Thank you, especially Jason and Ryan!",

    "text": "I'm torn on my rating for the new El Chorro Lodge.  I had visited the \"old\" El Chorro Lodge prior to the renovations, and enjoyed it (although I found the bar area seriously lacking).  But last weekend was my first trip to the upgraded version, and it was a mixed bag.  First of all, let me say that if I were rating on ambience alone, this place would get a solid 5 stars.  Their patio area is extensive, and there are so many cozy nooks with semi-private fireplaces scattered around that it's easy to find a quiet corner to relax in with your special someone.  The bar area has been increadibly re-done, and is beautiful!  My friend and I sat at the bar, and were entertained by the live band playing just a few steps away.    Now the downside.  The bartender that helped us (there were at least three behind the bar) was just ok.  He was very friendly, and very enthusiastic, but didn't seem very knowledgeable.  We asked him for drink specials, and were told there were none.  We asked for drink recommendations, and he had none.  We asked if they offered specialty martini's, and were told...\"um....we have the El Chorro Martini\"....finally we asked for the drink menu, and found that there actually were a BUNCH of different specialty cocktails and martinis that all looked appealing.    I ordered a beer (I know, I know, after all that....but it sounded delicious), and my friend ordered one of the specialty martinis with basil.  After 5 minutes I got my beer.  After 10 minutes, still no cocktail for my friend.  We mentioned it to another bartender, who told us that he'd pass it along.  Then our bartender came back and began to make the drink....slowly....Finally, when it looked like it was ready to be presented, our bartended said \"oh....I need to make you a new one.  The basil I used is still dirty\"......and the process began again.  Once the drink was received, it tasted great and we enjoyed the rest of our evening.  I guess I'm going to give four stars as an average for the 5 star ambience and 3 star service received.  But I will definitely be going back soon.",

We were going to grab a drink and go somewhere else, but the waitress in the bar said she would serve us in there (Elizabeth) and she totally turned our experience around.   Food is tasty. Don't have high expectations for portion size. I ordered the Pan Seared Escolar, which was wonderful It was served with snap peas and crispy potatoes. OK, so the potatoes looked like a Parmesan crisp served on top of the fish, not a side dish at all. There were 3 (THREE!!!) snap peas. Someone ordered the flash fried lobster, that was good. Someone else ordered the fillet - he said it was good. They still have the sticky buns...yum! White Cosmo was super great, best martini ever.   Pricey and a little overstated for my taste, but still a good experience all around. BTW... walked the restaurant after dinner, tons of empty tables. Don't understand the 2 hour wait???? Make a reservation... Thanks Elizabeth!",

In an effort to compete with the new, more modern trendy places in the area (BLT Steak, Prado), the restaurant has been completely revamped with a more modern, brighter feel. However, it still is attracting the silver-haired population.   The food, however, has also received a major overhaul. There are still comfort food options like Beef Stroganoff, or more current ones like the pan seared escolar (soooo good! Please try this, it's one of the better fish dishes I've had in AZ!). My Mom loved the duck, Grandma loved the Mushroom Ravioli, and  Dad loved the Pork Chop!   Every entree comes with a salad or cup of soup (the Steak and Onion soup is delish!), which is so rare these days for fine dining.   Great service, better atmosphere, but still not stepping away from the geriatrics, but overall, I was happy to give El Chorro another shot!   Yes, they still have the sticky buns.... and they are wonderful!",

Without a doubt one of my favorite dining experiences in Phoenix. My parents were visiting from out of town and I wanted to wow them with somewhere fantastic, El Chorro did not disappoint. We sat outside on the patio - what a great setting with some great music playing in the background.  Our server was fantastic (I wish I remembered his name, shame on me!). It was restaurant week and the $39 for an appt, entree and dessert was a steal of a deal, but we opted for the regular menu. A little pricey, but worth every penny. The sticky buns are to die for. El Chorro is the total package and I will, without a doubt, be going back there very soon.",

We sat on the patio - which was absolutely beautiful (and the reason this rating gets any stars!)  and had an amazing view of Camelback Mountain.  There was also a fair amount of heaters and fireplaces, so it would be nice to sit out there in colder weather, too.   It was pretty fun to people watch here - everyone was so expensive looking! And, at 23, I think I was the youngest person there by a solid 15 years.   The service here was extremely sub-par, especially considering the prices they charge.  We were greeted with a \"you have reservations, don't you?!\"  No, we don't. And now you just made us feel like we did something wrong by not making them - even though there was plenty of seating!  We were seated right away, regardless.   And, it goes downhill from there. The waiter was unfamiliar with the menu and had to have us point to several items on the menu.  The bus staff that brought us our food had quite a hard time reading the ticket that told them who ordered what, it would have been much faster to ask, \"who had the french toast?!\"  I was brought the wrong dish, and when it came out the second time, the eggs weren't cooked how I asked.  It took a good 15 minutes to get our credit card back from the waiter after we had given it to him to pay.  I tried to give the staff a little credit, because this place is brand new - but you think in this economy they could hire some experienced wait staff!   I thought the prices were ridiculous - $6 for a side of 2 eggs?! $13 for a fruit bowl!? Ouch.  As much I would like to come back for drinks on the patio at sunset, I don't think I can justify dealing with the staff and prices again.",

Not sanitary at all. We decided to move the party inside to their community table instead. It worked for our group. We all ordered the El Chorro Margarita that was on their Happy Hour menu. I ordered mine up (martini style). An epic fail. There's nothing worse than a martini with ice chips in it. We were all also disappointed in the drink's lack of flavor. They did have a good selection of food options. The best dish was the Southwestern Poutine. The street tacos were just ok, the soft taco shells could have been warmed up just a tad. We tried their famous sticky buns. Some really liked them, I wasn't overly impressed. The service was terrible. Our waitress kept disappearing. They added 20% gratuity to our bill because of our party size and it was obvious because she didn't bother to try and earn it. We also had a few dirty saucers handed to us. It was just old and southwestern and not the upscale environment I prefer. This place could use a renovation to modernize and help it live up to their website. You win some. You lose some. I give it a 2 out of 5.",

It came with sun dried tomatoes, asparagus and a potato pancakey thing that was pretty good.  The bread basket had the famous mini sticky buns, as well as a moist chocolate scone.  Service was extremely attentive - I think we had 5 different people waiting on us.  It was borderline overwhelming at times, but everyone meant well and was incredibly nice, so overall I'd consider it a positive.

The Eggs Benedict were absolute perfection. No BS, couldn't have asked for them to have been better in any way; it is hard to paoch an egg to perfection and they nailed it.

Absolutely loved the sticky buns they brought to the table.  It was like having dessert first.  Our server Stuart was one of the best waiters we have ever had.  Can't wait to return and sit outside when it's cooler, their outdoor seating area is beautiful with great views!",

We got there right at sunset and the backdrop of camelback mountain was spectacular! The whole dining patio was amazing...heaters everywhere, fire pits etc.  it was about 50 degrees while we ate and I never had to put on my jacket.  The food was amazing, the service excellent. Can't wait to co e back!",

It had the twin lobster tails that were flash fried as an entree and was the best thing I had ever tasted!  We now live in Kansas City and brought our kids to Phoenix for Spring Break and wanted to take them to the place w the twin lobster tails and some of the best food in the Valley.  However, what we experienced last night was anything but!  For one, they no longer had the twin lobster tails as an entree, but as an add-on to an entree for $35 and all we got were 6 little pieces of what was supposed to be Lobster, but not sure it was even Lobster!  I spent $300, w tip for the entire family and our meals and was extremely disappointed with what we got for our $$!!!  I would not recommend this place to anyone anymore...and sad to see such a great place it was once...is NO More!",

    "text": "Absolutely horrible experience! We were hoping for a nice meal on Christmas Eve, but were terribly underwhelmed. The Hosts: We were immediately judged based on how we were dressed and given awkward looks. Although we made a reservation 5 weeks in advance, we were placed in a secluded room in the back that was freezing cold. We requested to be seated at one of the many open tables in the main dining room and were eventually moved. We were still placed in the corner! Luckily, the server ended up being very nice- the only positive part of the meal. The Food: We wanted to split a dish and were charged a 7 dollar split fee that was not listed on the menu- outrageous! Furthermore, the 40 dollar beef ribs were tiny and not even good. The salad was small and very bland and the baked potato was served with limited toppings, including no cheese which was requested. Post-Meal Consequences: 2 members of our party- both having had the short ribs- had terrible stomach aches following the meal. Something was seriously wrong with the 2 dollar portion of 40 dollar ribs and the sickness caused by the food is very worrisome.  Conclusions: Do not attend El Chorro unless you want to have bad portions, high costs, rude hosts, and sickness following the meal. There are so many great options in the Paradise Valley area, and it is a major mistake to blow your money and time on this restaurant.",

Everything on the HH menu is 3$.... that is crazy! We had decent margaritas that were on the strong side (3$), split the sliders (3 sliders and fries for 3$... and the meat was good, juicy and seasoned with onions... really yummy stuff), and the sticky buns (pretty standard sticky buns). The food was tasty and inexpensive... the portions were large. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this place for HH and I know I'll be back!  PS The restaurant itself is beautiful and the view of the mountains is nice.  PPS The bartender was friendly and our wait time for drinks and food was incredibly short.",

The Christmas experience is a fixed menu with three options, beef, salmon and turkey. The food is \"old school \" good, the service is great and the setting is fabulous.   Although Christmas there is fairly new to us, this restaurant has been a Paradise Valley tradition for generations of my family. It has been getting better, too. There are lots of outside patios and hidden nooks to enjoy a drink with your friends and family.",

    "text": "This establishment needs a serious attitude adjustment.  Nothing makes up for service this bad but adding insult to injury is their slapping on a 20% gratuity (for a party of 6) when 3 of the 6 entrees ordered came out wrong, they ignored a food allergy, had run out of 3 of their house specialties of the day and took 45 minutes for the wait staff to figure out who had our table.  After electing to go to the bar to order a bottle of wine for the table, glasses arrived with no wine?  At the conclusion of the meal we asked to speak with a manager (which took another 15 minutes) and the most they could offer is to remove 2 of the entrees off the bill.  For the prices they charge and historic reputation it wouldn't have killed them to comp the $200 tab.  Let's talk a moment about the \"famous sticky buns\", they used to be when a hot, full basket would arrive at your table...now they count them...6 people, 6 buns (you get the picture) and refills will cost you and what is with the extra \"fillers\" in the basket?!  Sticky buns are sticky buns, leave the rest of the junk out as guessing every basket is returned with those remaining. Bottom line, If you want the \"privilege\" of paying $22 for Eggs Benedict and $16 for an Omelette of the Day (as previous reviewers commented (no substitutions) I suggest you go elsewhere, anywhere else.  Then perhaps come back for a glass of wine and the views. Take the time to read other poor reviews...in every instance the Manager attempts to comment and correct the wrongs but the same complaints are listed over and over again.  They are obviously doing nothing to improve their service.   I have been a resident of Paradise Valley for 20+ years and have loved El Chorro and brought many out of town guests, friends and family there.  Sad to say, I will not be returning.  I hope The owners are reading some of these reviews.",

The food was good, although I was surprised that theyre catogrized as American food. With a name like El Chorro, and given the decor I was expecting mexican food.  I was very surprised by the decor. Again, judging by the name I was expecting it to be darker w/ a lot of rich colors and western pieces. the western pieces were there but it was more akin to what I imagine a resort in Cabo would look like. Very bright and open w/ lots of white and blue accents. I actually told my friend that Id love to have their bar chairs in my (dream) kitchen.

    "text": "I have been a LIFE LONG Paradise Valley resident, and have been going to El Chorro the whole time. I can't tell you how disappointed I am. El Chorro used to be the place we went when we wanted the El Chorro experience, and when we wanted a good meal. It looks like it is no longer going to be that place. Ever since they renovated, things have been slipping, now they have slipped so far I'm crossing it off my list. It's sad but it was because of their decisions.  Earlier this week we went in to El Chorro for for my father's 60th birthday. We had left an event and we going there for a drink and birthday dessert. We showed up and sat at the bar, the portion that is outside. First, we were greeted with a dirty bar. There was a bus tub sitting on the bar in front of us (which the bartender moved to the other side of the bar 20 min after we sat down), the back bar was a mess with employee's personal items, bar towels, and god knows what else, there were dirty linens falling out of a cabinet, etc.... The bar was dirty!   Second, we wait for the bartender for about 2 min. to even acknowledge we were sitting there. He was too busy talking to one of the servers at the service well. When he gave us our menus we opened them up to see what we wanted. But we opened the menus and they fell apart. Instead of getting us new ones, the bartender watched us put the back together for him. We then ordered our drinks and a dessert. The drinks are the only reason there's one star (and maybe the view), they weren't half bad. At least he didn't shake my Manhattan.   Third, we got our desserts and they were horrible. The brownie sunday. The brownies were either old or a very bad food service product. The ice cream tasted like it was out of a carton, and it had tons of whipped cream. I think they were trying to hide how bad the dish was with all the whipped cream. You're telling me that a place like El Chorro can't take the time to make their own ice cream and brownies. I could have done better in my kitchen if you gave me an hour. It was embarrassing.   Fourth, my mother was very unhappy about this. I told her to call and tell a manager. I'm in the industry and I know if a life long guest had an experience like this, the manager would want to know about it - so they could try to fix the problem. But, instead of trying to fix the problem, when my mother called, they blew her off. She hasn't heard a word.  I went to work the next day and talked to a few of my friends/neighbors/regulars and they all said the same exact thing. They said El Chorro has been slipping for a long time and they aren't going back any time soon. We are the people that keep El Chorro open, especially in the summer. We are the people that bring our out-of-town guests for a good brunch or good dinner. That's not going to happen anymore. Let's face it, El Chorro is an institution, they are going to be there for a long time, and I hope they are. The views alone are worth going, even if it's a mediocre meal. But, They will no longer be getting my hard earned money. I hope this changes, and I hope they reach out. I would love for things to turn around, but my guess is, with this management, nothing is going to happen. We went for my father's 60th birthday, a big family celebration, and we we're very, very disappointed.",

Don't get me wrong, it was \"A-OK,\" it just didn't blow me away.  The history of this place dates back to the 1930's and is pretty amazing.  You can read about it on their website.  The outdoor dining area is huge and has great views of Camelback Mountain.  The live music provides for a nice ambiance as well... at least live music when we were there on a Saturday night.  And our meal got off to a nice start with the relish tray and sticky buns - yum!  But the service was really slow and the food was nothing to write home about.  We found it to be overpriced as well.  I'd consider returning to El Chorro for brunch or lunch or drinks or just picking up sticky buns \"to go\" sometime, but I wouldn't recommend it for dinner.",

I'm a sucker for huevos rancheros so you better believe that was an immediate decision and there were so delicious! Good crisp crunchy tortillas but not too much, along with over medium eggs and potatoes ooooooh yes! And the sticky buns - are you kidding!? I could eat those all day long and I am not a sweet breakfast person. Also there's so much history behind El Chorro be sure to have your server share! All in all I love this place and need to get back for dinner!",

The pork belly was yummy but the foie gras I can leave it. It won't keep me from trying it somewhere else though. I got the Angus rib eye which they made to my liking extra rare please with leftovers for breakfast. The pot shrimp appetizer, fried shrimp was yummy too. My boyfriend got the braised beef, mom the pork chop, sister in law the center piece filet, ex the caesar salad. I can keep going on but can't remember everyone's orders. Just that we all enjoyed our dinner and service",

    "text": "Happy Hour in a historic Mexican Hacienda - Happy HourZ a-z  For a taste of times gone by, treat yourself to the El Chorro Happy Hour available Monday through Saturday from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm.  The menu features a nice variety of appetizers.  Choose from deviled eggs to tacos or calamari to sliders, all ranging in price from $6.00 to $10.00.  In addition, the margaritas, well drinks and house wine are only $5.00.  Even more tempting is their \"Sticky Bun\", a signature sweet treat.  If you like artwork then you will enjoy El Chorro's collection.  The bar and patio area really sets this restaurant apart from the rest.  In fact, you get a great view of Camelback mountain which is located south of the restaurant, right across Lincoln drive.  Have you ever wondered who Lincoln Drive was named after?  Well here is an interesting fact.  Did you know that in 1934, a Dr. John C. Lincoln built this site as the Judson School for Girls so his daughter Lillian could attend school while he was building Camelback Inn (present day JW Marriott Camelback Inn).  Because of this, you might say this restaurant is \"old school\".   So plan a visit to El Chorro sometime soon.  One of our hobbies is visiting Happy Hour venues in Scottsdale and Phoenix.  Our website is a great resource if you want to Find Your Happy Place.  Happy HourZ a-z.",

    "text": "My family and I went to celebrate my mother in laws birthday and we wanted to sit on the patio because of how great the weather is right now. We had reservations, everything was great. Except the fact that it started to get windy and all the pre flowers or foliage was all over the table and all over us. And then you take a closer look and there are tiny bugs all over the table. It was pretty gross. Eventually we moved inside because of this.   We wanted the sticky buns and apparently they are only given to those who order an entree and not a salad. They almost charged us $12 more and we only wanted two sticky rolls for those who ordered the salad. Our waitress was able to talk to manager about giving a roll to everyone. It was just pretty disappointing how much they charge for bread. It should be included for everyone because of how expensive everything on the menu is!   Overall, the food was delicious. If you are going to dine at El Churro, you've gotta try the seafood pasta! But be ready to spend a lot of money. The stars are only for how great the food tasted, however, I doubt we will be going back anytime soon.",

They use a tonic which tastes like some kind of medicine. I turned it back and had a very good BloodyMary instead.Secondly , my wife and I ordered  the traditional eggs Benedict and again we were very unhappy with the dish . The Canadian bacon and English muffin  were not up to standards for a high end  restaurant . The bacon was substandard ; it was thin and fatty . The muffin was so hard it could not be cut with the knife provided. The egg was not cooked properly.  We have been ElChorro customers for years and dearly love the place. So we are hoping things improve .",

    "text": "Recently my husband and I went to El Churro.  We were visiting the area and we heard he cinnamon rolls were good.    Atmosphere; It's a fancy restuaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating as well as bar.  We sat inside and even though we had reservations, I still felt as though I was sitting on top of other tables.  I would have preferred more room between the 2 people seats.  Food: I ordered the shaved brussel salad, which was deliscious.  It was much bigger than what I was anticipating.  It was great though and I appreciated it was chopped.  We had asked for a side of the cinnamon rolls but the waitress never brought them out so we settled for the 2 that came with the meal.  The cinnamon rolls are deliscious and I can see why they are recommended!  For my entree, I ordered the sea bass special which came with a few beets, brussel sprouts, and carrots.  The plating was beautiful, but for a special, I would have expected a slightly bigger dish.  Never the less, it was cooked well.  My husband ordered the lamb shank which I enjoyed more.  Dessert: We ordered the brownie sundae dessert to split.  When I think of a brownie sundae, I think a large dessert but it was a small serving.  If the waitress had informed us of the size, we would have ordered 2.  The flavor was great and I enjoyed the passion fruit in the center.    Summary: In all, I liked El Churro a lot and will be back.  I recommend it to anyone local and my personal favorites were the brussel sprouts as well as the lamb shank.",

So yesterday i did a get together with my meetup group. There was about 10 of us already around 4pm. We all try to order a drink the waitress said we cannot pay individually especially if big group. If we had more 6 people it will be one check. We were trying pay individually and even wouldn't get the cash.    So some of my members try to buy drinks inside the bar and got refused from the bartender to serve us. They said we only can order from the waitress. The waitress was so rude no personality just such a bitch to us she should lose her job.   We ask the manager to talk to us he came out and said this is there policy. This is bad! I was there 3 years ago and it was so much better then. I will never go there again it is too bad.",

    "text": "When you first arrive at El Chorro, expectations are high because of its location, it's valet ($6) service, and its entrance/atmosphere.   However, the restaurant fell short due to its food (mainly the appetizers) for its price.   For our table of 9, i think we ordered about 5 appetizers. Because sharing is caring, I had a chance to try all of them. To be honest, i wasn't not impressed by most of them. I felt the fried items tasted fried. The sausage bites weren't anything special. The pretzel bread it came with are sliced and weren't soft as pretzel bread usually is by the time i got ahold of them. The foie gras was pretty good, but it came with 3 or so mini pieces of toast. The board wasn't bad, but again for a $30 price tag...I'm not sold.   As for the entrees, I ended up getting an vegetarian dish (polenta) and I added a protein to it, which was suggested by the waitress. I liked the polenta dish a lot and its flavors. It outshined the salmon i ordered with it. And the only thing I knew about El Chollo before coming was it had great sticky buns. These we had to ask for, and they were pretty good - just a little sweet but expected. I can't speak for the other entrees, but I heard the lamb was tender and it fell off the shank and the prime rib was good, cooked to asked temperature.   Overall my personal experience is a 3 star because I don't think I would come back as the prices don't justify the food or service. There are other nice comparable options.",

The restaurant's campus is drop dead gorgeous, and the views of Camelback are incredible! The sticky buns are to die for! But that's about where it ends. The french onion soup and various salads are run of the mill. For entrees, I've had salmon, grouper and even taste-tested steaks from El Chorro and they are nothing better than average. Somehow, they even ruined a brownie sundae by filling the brownie with lemon curd! The flavors are generally bland an uninventive, and there's really nothing (other than the sticky buns!) that sets this apart from any of the many \"fancy\" restaurants in surrounding resorts. In my opinion, this is a great place to impress your grandmother, but certainly not a location I would visit to satisfy my taste buds.",

Servers were ok but seemed to be consumed with themselves, especially the wine server.  Alright, some fancy places are like that so we tolerate.     We ordered our meals, all of which sounded great on the menu.  When the meals came out, about half of them were very disappointing.  My daughter ordered the filet which came out overcooked and cold.  I ordered the short ribs which were very dry and flavorless, like someone boiled them for too long.  The sauce on them tasted ok, but meat was not edible.  One of our guests ordered the lamb shank which also tasted like it was boiled and afterwards dressed with a nice sauce.  At least the shank was not dried but it lacked any flavor.  The other dishes seemed to be enjoyed so we were at about 50/50 at this table.  Those sticky buns though, not one of us liked the stale little cinnamon rolls.  Who serves that with dinner??  For the reputation, for the type of place and for the money they charge, I can't believe they serve this kind of food and have this kind of service.",

I had the Best of Both Worlds Eggs Benedict which is one bennie of Jumbo lump blue crab cake with tomato salsa hollandaise and one bennie of petite filet with bearnaise sauce, along with a side of roasted potatoes.   The crab cake bennie was delicious, huge portion of crab - much more than I expected.   I've never had a steak bennie before so this was a new twist for me.  I loved it, and the filet portion was again a little larger than I expected for a brunch dish at this price point.  Great flavors, great meal.   Had a great bloody mary as well, although I do prefer a little less horseradish.  They had a special on sparkling wine and my wife ordered a bottle of Chandon bubbly which we both sipped off of, then they graciously stuck a regular wine cork in the bottle for us to carryout.  Our server was awesome - super attentive and friendly.    Their patio is so money, definitely the place to be.  Misting system in full force, lots of umbrellas and of course great scenery.  It was quite comfortable, and we had yet another great experience at El Chorro.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review based on hosting a private event at El Chorro. I  work for a university and we chose one of the private spaces at El Chorro for an alumni reception featuring our university President. We had a fabulous experience from start to finish, and I would happily return for brunch, dinner, or any other occasion.  The first thing I want to praise is the amazing pre-planning customer service we received from Chelsa and the event team. Being Arizona we anticipated sunny skies and chose to book the combination indoor/outdoor private space for our event, but when the week of the event rolled around, it was some of the worst weather in the area in a long time, including torrential rain and wind. Chelsa worked closely with me throughout the week to monitor the situation, and in the end, it worked out that they were able to accommodate us in a larger indoor space and were kind enough not to charge us extra for it.  My mouth is watering right now trying to write a review for our meal. We did the El Chorro BBQ buffet and every bite I had was better than the last. The meats were cooked perfectly, sides were fresh and seasoned well (shout out to the chef who \"cheesified\" our mac and cheese, I will have dreams about that for a long time), and I can also confirm that the sticky buns are famous for a reason!  Despite the adverse weather, it was easy to tell that El Chorro is a great location, with all of the Southwest charm that had been advertised. Our event space was beautiful, and the staff was especially attentive to our setup needs with the last minute change of event spaces. The A/V was already set up when we arrived, and everything worked perfectly. We were highly satisfied with the quality of service and food for the price; if you're looking for a great overall experience, look no further.",

After dinner, they hit me for a $6 fee. Not much in the scheme of things, but it was a nickel and dime move for an \"upscale\" place.

The kitchen staff came and brought gravy on the side. I did not order this and he left it here for me. It was an awkward three minute exchange. I had began to try it since they brought it out and the waiter came rushing out and grabbed it and said this was not for me. And headed to other side of the bar and handed it to the lady EVEN THOUGH I DIPPED MY FORK IN IT AND ATE IT!!!!!! I was appalled. The man next to me noticed as well and was just as shocked as I was.   Never got my water refilled a single time. Same with my friend.

    "text": "Second trip back. Forward one week.  Today's table was cozily situated next to a gorgeous fireplace which was needed because as the afternoon waned the chill set in.  As always the ambiance was 5 stars.  But....service was hard to locate.  In fact, after sitting and chatting and chatting we decided to hunt down some wait staff.  We got bits and pieces of many servers but never the full attention of one person.  Why was this?  It wasn't that crowded...?  The happy hour food makes a great late lunch.   If you team that with a cocktail it is the best meal to be had.  Interesting to have a salad on the happy hour menu but it worked...for one...no sharing on that one.  If the management could add a few perky waiters or waitresses this place could be heaven.",

The food was just ok - nothing special.  The sticky buns everyone raved up - did not come out as an appetizer or even after meal treat - oddly came out with our dinner so it was basically over looked.  The restaurant was not crowded yet we were sat at one of the few tables without a view.  My biggest problem was the flies.  They were everywhere and we were seated INSIDE the restaurant not on the patio.  When you go to an up-scale restaurant to celebrate a special occassion, who wants to be shooing flies away from their food.  It was really disgusting and distracting.  For the money we spent to eat here I felt ripped off.  We ate at the Roaring Fork the next night and it was superb so if you are going to be in the area - you should consider alternatives who have better food, better service and a more pleasing environment - don't waste your money on this place.",

They kept True to the sticky buns and the relish tray (which truly isn't great but i eat it and appreciate it being there because im hungry and with family which is lovely HAHA, also rolls on request, really on request and they are worse than grands, yes i wish i was joking) but really the new place is better in some aspects!  Its huge and really pretty but the food is not good.  I wish it good and hope over time it will be but the food was terrible and ive eaten good food i got duck it was so bad and  their signature fish dish which we were told that the workers came in on their day off to eat \"pan seared escolar\" was Eh, i would rather get Sea Bass at a good restaurant like Ocean Club.  I didn't go in like someone expecting to get blown away i expected a good Easter dinner based on the fact ive been here before years ago and enjoyed it so i went in expecting the price per dish to be as good as it was, well its not and its sad because the place is pretty and it looks like horses can get married in the back grassy area (check it out, it makes sense).",

It has recently been remodeled so we were excited to meet friends there to see the changes.  We should have known there was a \"problem\" when we pulled into the nearly empty parking lot.  The new bar area is very pretty and the view of the back of Camelback Mtn is still gorgeous.  Unfortunately, the bar menu is extremely limited and quite expensive.  In the past El Chorro was a fun, buzzing place for happy hour, but now the happy hour is limited to pricey watered down drinks and an expensive shrimp cocktail or brisket sandwich. Even the trademark cheese and crackers are gone!  We are so sad to say we will no longer take our out of state visitors to El Chorro.  Very disappointing experience and we will not be back.",

    "text": "I was very excited about the re-opening of El Chorro.  I always felt it was a great location that was hampered by a boring menu and a tired looking restaurant.  There is no doubt that the property and build-out was money well spent.  It is a gorgeous restaurant.  It is a shame that they didn't put the same amount of money and effort into training their staff on service and execution.  We ordered the shrimp cocktail and the cheese plate which was $18 for 4 store bought crackers, 2 small, thin pieces of cheese and 4 small, thin slices of salami.  The salads were horrendous - the vegetable chopped salad was a rectangular plate with little rows of potato, celery, carrot, walnuts and cranberries - all totally oversalted and just not appetizing.  The signature steak and onion soup was gelatinous and lukewarm.  (They mistakenly brought the baked potato soup first which had an oatmeal consistency.) And by the way, according to our server we were allowed to order whatever salads we wanted to go with our entrees.  At the end there were upcharges on the bill for the non \"house\" salads.     We never received rolls or sticky buns (after asking twice) and they finally brought sticky buns out when the entrees were plated.  In addition, we did not have bread and butter plates and the utensils were not replenished.   My friend's $40+ steak was ordered medium rare, yet came out well done.  He ordered no starch so they brought him a plate of carrots!  I ordered \"double vegetable\" with my chicken instead of starch and I literally had 4 snow peas and 3 green beans on the plate.   My spouse ordered the duck and the side dish it came with was absolutely disgusting - some kind of pomegranate-y starch thing that had a sour taste.   My friend sent the steak back and it came out bloody and rare - and with starch on the plate.  That one was sent back and the chef himself brought out the third one - with starch.  They bought us a round of desserts (the molten cake was cooked through so it was basically a warm brownie) and took the steak off the bill.    I would return for drinks but not for the food.",

    "text": "Nice location but that's where it ends. The street sign on Lincoln Dr. would lead you to keep on driving as it looks like a trailer park sign. My Wife and I both said out loud \"This can't be it\"  Much of the parking lot was dirt which struck me as somewhat odd for a would be \"High End\" restaurant. I made our reservation 16 days in advance for Valentines day at 6:30 pm. I requested patio seating for our occasion.  We were seated right in front of the entrance to the rear indoor dining area and adjacent to the wait station so it was fairly hectic, (strike one).  For the event it was a restricted menu of selections. Sticky buns were on the table before we ordered which struck me a little odd but after reading reviews I guess it's \"Their\" thing. Dessert before dinner. Can't imagine filling up on those when a steak costs a small fortune, but hey. I ordered the Tenderloin cooked medium well and my wife had the Chicken. Sides offered were both of the Seafood nature, Lobster Bisque and Crab Salad, (strike two) We passed on both. My Tenderloin came out cold and way undercooked (strike three.)  I didn't want to ruin the Evening by saying anything so I powered through. It was tiny anyhow so it didn't take a lot of effort. My Wife said her Chicken was delicious.  Fast forward to the next morning. We talked about Dinner over coffee and I said be honest, how did you really like the experience? She too said she didn't want to ruin the evening and that's why she said her Chicken was delicious. She stated her Chicken was bland and that she's had better at Carabbas. I told her my Steak was cold. We both commented on the less than stellar table location even with making reservations more than two weeks in advance. Our less than average dinner was right at $200, with nearly a 70 minute drive one way. So a two hour plus round trip disappointment.   Also keep in mind this restaurant is immense, my guess is it seats between 400-450 people as I overheard the wait staff say someone at table 89 (on the patio) needed something. 4 persons at each table, that's 356 people on the patio alone, not including the immense indoor seating as well, so if you were hoping for any special attention or treatment, stay home.  I would also like to comment on one completely tacky maneuver orchestrated by the Valet service. I previously mentioned much of the parking lot is dirt, I had just washed my car and decided to use the Valet Service for $6 as I figured my car would be parked in the paved Valet lot. I was right, they parked it right up front. When we returned my car was no longer in the front. They had moved it to the back to make room for the very expensive/impressive cars like Mercedes, Porsche's, Teslas' I know this because the Valet told me. Designed to impress the guests while they wait for their cars to be pulled up. My nice shiny car  showed up with a layer of dust from being parked in their dirt lot. What really disappoints me is that I put up with that crap AND I gave the guy a $4 tip for bringing me a dirty car! The more I thought about it the madder it made me!!  I almost always read Yelp reviews before I take the leap, but in this case I didn't. Their 3.5 stars and $200 for a dinner for two should have clued me in on the experience but I think I, as well as most others, are captured by the scenery and it's Paradise Valley location, and by default rate the meal higher than it should be.  THOROUGHLY UNDERWHELMING",

He came over to our table and apologized about what happened two years ago. Service from Bartendar, waitress,hostess and GM was fantastic.

So when our friends came to visit that was the place we wanted to take them for the beautiful restaurant and view.  Well our/their experience was not very pleasant.  First we were the first person to walk in the door at 4:00 and we were told we could only sit inside or at the one table outside that seats 18 people, so needless to say we sat at that table.  I explained to hostess that we were just having cocktails and appetizers but she stated all tables were reserved.  Ok so after sitting in the sun on the most uncomfortable seats and after appetizers and cocktails we decided we would like to have more food so we wanted dinner.  I went to the hostess and was told we could not get a table.  So mind you the restaurant had many many tables empty all the while we were there (3 hours). So we asked to speak to manager (my husband would not eat dinner at that uncomfortable table/chair) the manager came over and could care less, he stated they had reservations and there is nothing he could do and walked away.  My friends hated the attitude of staff and we were very embarrassed, all these empty tables and we could not enjoy a meal.  So not sure if I can get my friends back there, not a good experience.  Very disappointed.  Well as instructed I did call and did email without any response.",

I'm not sure why older establishments cannot keep up with the times. The manager should go to Matt's Big Breakfast to see what fresh food tastes like. The service was just as bad as the food. A few people had requests, I.e medium cooked poached eggs, etc. None of it was honored; it seemed like the waitress didn't even bother to write anything down. I ordered an omelette and specified gluten free (the menu says to specify). It showed up with an English muffin right on top. But I don't think that was the only gluten because fast forward an hour and I'm sick. Perhaps the potatoes or the pork filling in the omelette. Perhaps if the manager reads this, he will get a clue.

Extremely rude young brunettes who refused to seat us until our elderly parents came hobbling in. I'm pretty sure in the hospitality industry you learn that making eye contact while considering a patron's presence is important. We had a party of 8 and a reservation. We were not asking for special treatment, just to be seated before the old folks and their walkers and oxygen tanks arrived.   If I'm paying $20 for a salad, I expect not to be treated as though you're doing me a favor by seating my party at our reserved table.",

All of the food was beautifully served family style  Platters of fruit, Caesar salad, eggs Benedict, grilled vegetables that were undercooked, and trout.

    "text": "Restaurant week menu was excellent, great food for a great price!  We ordered the Shrimp Pepper Pot as an additional appetizer since it's so popular and it was SO GOOD. You'll be grateful they bring you so much bread with it, you'll want to eat all the broth possible.   French onion soup was a lighter take, no baked cheese covering the soaked bread. I liked this lighter spin, the soup was very flavorful and slightly salty (which I like). The flavors were there even though some of the calories weren't.  The Brussel sprout kale salad was fresh with tons of different textures. It was lightly dressed so all the different ingredients really came through.   The grouper was perfectly cooked, great crunch coating on the outside. It was light, flakey and not fishy at all.   Steak was very well cooked, the mashed potatoes with the sauce were what made this steak/potatoes dish sing.   The desserts were fun, perfect portion size after all the courses. The ginger carrot cake packed a big ginger punch, if you don't like ginger don't order this dish. The salted Carmel ice cream helped ton the ginger down but if you need a break from the ginger avoid the sauce they put on top. The passion fruit chocolate cake was very good, the passion fruit provides a different spin to what typically feels heavy. The bourbon ice cream wasn't over powering, very creamy.   Drinks were delicious. Service was excellent. Atmosphere is relaxing, if the weather is good definitely sit outside.",

We had an awful time, service was spotty, we were told we couldn't take appetizers into the dining room, we were told we couldn't order the sticky buns until menus were up....just stupid things that never happen in a professional restaurant. The food was OK. The menu seemed suited for the 50 & 60 year-olds that seemed to frequent that place. When it came time to getting the cake the waitress was nowhere to be found. Once the cake came we had to wait for candles and finally a lighter was found too.   I have eater in a lot of good restaurants and unfortunately this is not one of them. I won't be back and you should run away.",

We got there on time but weren't seated for 10 minutes. It was raining and the host sat us at a table with no umbrella, luckily she saw the look on our faces and put us under an umbrella. We sat for another 10 or 15 minutes without being greeted. I went up to the host stand where there were about 4 hosts and 2 managers and they were no help. Our server didn't apologize and his service didn't make a come back either. It was buffet style so literally his only job was to keep our drinks full...couldn't even do that. We heard another server explaining the options for brunch, dessert, etc at the buffet...we had to find everything on our own.   We've been coming to El Chorro for years and we've never had good service. We continue to come back because of the food and view. I don't think it's worth it anymore.",

He even brought two people in our group blankets because they were cold (we sat outside). 5-Star Service!  We will be back many more times to enjoy the property and amazing food!

I tasted my husband's margarita, it was really good, not too sweet. My friend and I had the old fashioned, great flavor!  We had dinner reservations, it wasn't too crowded last evening (a Thursday in May) but our friends come here often and always have reservations just in case.  We had their sticky buns (cinnamon rolls) to start as it is a tradition that our friends have. They were good! I was so hungry I ate the whole thing before dinner but my husband and friend saved it for dessert. My husband and I split the Caesar Salad, it was great.  I was torn between ordering the filet and the Sea Bass that was the special. Our waiter Ryan was excellent (our friends had him on their last visit) and he steered me towards the Sea Bass and I was not disappointed. Loved the risotto and the root vegetables. My husband had the Ribeye and he loved it. We were too full for dessert but I bet they are good!  It was a wonderful experience. Our waiter Ryan grew up in Scottsdale and he gave us some recommendations for breakfast today.",

I am so glad we came here to try the food out. I think she is now convinced the food here isn't worth spending 40k for a wedding here.  I guess I came in here with High expectations for the food. I was looking forward to trying the famous sticky buns. Let me tell you it's basically a cinnamon roll but the ones that we had was not fresh and hard. I was expecting it to come out fresh and soft especially since we showed up when they just opened for Happy Hour at 4pm.   Sticky Buns here was a failure. I'd pick Cinnabon any day over this. The shrimp pepper pot looked amazing in the pictures I had to try it. Reality is it was really salty. Ok other thing we tried was the short ribs with mash potatoes and French beans and Carrots. That was probably the best dish of all but it was short ribs how could you really mess that up. I've had similar elsewhere and Beckett's Table has one that's pretty awesome.   So is there a dish here that I have tried that would make me want to come back? Not really. Maybe the scenery for sure above the food.   2 stars for the scenery and service.",

The sticky buns ARE all everyone says they are: ewy goey goodness. The margaritas are served in a tall and skinny glass but are decent, not super strong, but good. For 5$ on HH I'm happy.   As for other food, I've tried the flatbread, it was very tasty. The sliders were good but nothing to write home about-I feel like the wagu beef might be a bit of an overstatement...not everything should be called wagu-you know? The chips and salsa are decent. The best part about this place by far are the views. Service had always been very good and quick. The place really clears out when happy hour ends though.

    "text": "3 experiences here, one happy hour and 2 celebration dinners, I'll give it to you straight. If you come here during happy hour with the intention of eating off the non-happy hour menu I'd say you're making a mistake...well unless you're not looking to eat a lot of good food and drink good drinks at a fraction of the price. My lady and I made the decision to switch from the formal menu to the much more casual menu by the bar and didn't regret it at all! All the food we tried was great, in perfectly shareable portions, and the drinks were cheap and good (what else could we could ask for right?). Come here for happy hour...especially if the weather permits sitting outside. Both dinners I've had here were delicious. The crab & tuna dynamite and shrimp pepper pot are a great way to start your meal here...also must I mention the sticky buns? The food is pretty good. But, honestly the only reason I'm giving 4 stars is because I haven't had anything on the menu yet that salivates my mouth just thinking about it. Don't get me wrong though, I foresee myself adding a star in the near future but not quite yet. Aside from the eats, the service is always great. Our servers are always humorous, personable, and do a great job. El Chorro is mastering the holy trinity of dining with great food, great service, and a wonderful atmosphere.",

I was surprised to see how beautiful the restaurant is. I've driven by too many times to count, but never got a glimpse past the front gate. The landscaping is gorgeous, and I liked that the decor wasn't over the top.  My meal was short, since I personally arrived a little late. But we had a large group, and our server was wonderful. I had a side Caesar salad as a starter, and the Beef Stroganoff as my entree. I love Caesar salads, and this one certainly satisfied. On to the Beef Stroganoff...It was slightly saltier than I would have preferred, but it didn't take away from the overall quality. Prices seem to be a little steep for the amount of food, but I didn't feel totally robbed after.  All in all, I would recommend checking the place out. I've heard the happy hour is great.",

    "text": "WEDDINGS BEWARE!!! So we have been in contact with the wedding coordination group since January 17th 2012, planning our wedding from away as we live in Ohio, letting them know our plans to be out in AZ the last week in March and planned on getting together to discuss in person. When we got there, the girl in particular was very stand offish and by NO MEANS put a personal touch on the planning. She stood on the patio and pointed where we'd be at for our wedding and did not even have the courtesy to go down to the lawn to show us options for rehearsal and set up. We asked if we could decorate, and we got the comment of \"you can decorate a little, very minimal, but NOTHING that would distract our dinner guests\" SO...it is very apparent that they care more about disturbing their guests that people planning for their ceremony. We actually had additional people there and received comments from them saying \"It felt as if you needed to be careful to fit into their world and to be sure not to inconvenience them\" Already bothered by this, we decided to still go through with it has we had exchanged 20+ emails with them, and thought we were in to deep as it was. When we received the contact, there was a 100% PRICE INCREASE!! I immediately emailed them back ad received the \"amount of effort, set-up and landscaping costs we incur.  We had some issues at the start of the year that have caused us to raise our pricing.  And we reserve the right to increase pricing\" I abruptly asked\" in the 20+ emails you could not have let us know this\" and we got the ever so nice response of \".  We communicate with hundreds of people each day and we cannot keep track of who has the most current information if it's something we emailed a while ago\" REALLY?? REALLY?? Needless to say I was threw with them, and decided to take our wedding party elsewhere. PLEASE feel free to get ahold of me and I will tell you a location where PEOPLE ACTUALLY CARE!!",

The sticky buns were enough in the first 10 seconds of sitting down to keep me glued to my seat for the next year. Between the four of us we had Bloody Mary's and Mimosas, all of which were tasty. The Eggs Benedict was perfect, brioche french toast was like a dessert, the dessert table had small portions of every bit of yummy sweet goodness you can imagine, and everything in between was great (I thought my husband was going to have to roll me out of there!). This is officially my new favorite brunch place, and my family agrees. Our server was great, and on a day we expected it to be overly crowded and busy, they managed the crowd and buffet food perfectly. The outside patio was so nice, even when it was over 100 outside, thanks to the abundance of shade and misters. Thanks for an awesome experience!",

    "text": "The new, old El Chorro Lodge has been reopened for all of two days, and a friend of a friend managed to secure a reservation during their soft opening, so I got an opportunity to check it out.  I was impressed, but not blown away.  Everything I tasted was quite competent, but if I had to choose a word to describe the menu, I would suggest \"staid.\"  Perhaps even \"stodgy,\" but that may be more harsh than I intend.  Review the dinner menu.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2FaWqVVJ&s=ae5d3258a5833325d83c692669914a3417266e2265150d44959ac376a0aa5aba\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/aWqVVJ</a>.  There, see what I mean?  Replete with Traditional American entrees and sides, at what I would consider fairly exorbitant prices.  I would say that I wouldn't go back to eat this food at these prices, unless someone else was paying.    I should note that a big part of why I wasn't impressed is because this place is simply not my style.  The wait staff, attired in khakis and blue shirts, was a little too informal for the prices we were paying, I felt.  The menu options were a little boring for my taste.  The cocktail menu is exactly not what I'm looking for these days, although I will be very interested to see what Happy Hour looks like.  The decor is a tad heavy on the Old Southwest theme, although to be fair, this place not only pulls it off rather stylishly but also is among the most authentically old and southwestern establishments in the Phoenix metro area.    The patio and open bar are fantastic.  The bar area is considerable, and the patio is palatial - up above Lincoln Dr enough to be fairly quiet, with a gorgeous view of Camelback, sunset here must be incredible.    Anyway, back to the food.  Everything was very well executed, from the sticky buns we were served upon being seated to the desserts we ordered.  I chose the soup of the day to start, a tomato/basil concoction that was quite hearty and thoroughly enjoyed it.  The salads my dining companions ate looked boring to me, but they all claimed them to be excellent, with \"the best Caesar dressing ever\" and \"polenta croutons?!?\" being the verdict for the Caesar salad, at least.  On to the entrees.  I ordered the crispy duck, which I found to be delicious and quite hearty, though not what I would call crispy by any means.  It was a very sizable portion, and very well prepared.  My dining companions ordered the pork chop, the lamb, and the salmon, and we each sampled from each other's plates.  I would try the lamb if I went back, but the consensus seemed to be that everything was very well prepared, with the duck being a winner.  It was served with a heap of mushy sweet potatoes (just like my mom makes at Thanksgiving - delicious!) and red cabbage, which I sampled and declined to finish.  Again, not quite my style.    We moved on to dessert - sticky bread pudding with a bourbon glaze and the warm chocolate cake.  The bread pudding was a winner at the first two or three bites, but grew one-dimensional as I continued nibbling at it.  The chocolate cake was decadent, among the best I've ever tasted.  It was clearly made with a considerable amount of dark chocolate, which seals the deal for me.  And in case you were wondering, my dining companions apparently have no stamina when it comes to dessert.  Suckers.    Anyway, as I've said now several times, this place is just not quite me.  It's totally classy and very high in quality, but not quite adventurous enough for my taste.  I'd love to come back for brunch, and once they unveil their happy hour menu, I'm sure I'll be back to check it out, but I won't be back for dinner unless I can convince someone else to pick up the check at the end of the evening.    As a side note, this place is so very Paradise Valley.  It's a welcome relief knowing that there is a place that is so anti-scene out there.  It's been a little while since I've been both the youngest and among the poorest in a room, and I will say it was a little comforting.  Just don't tell the Scottsdale people about this place, and we'll all be happy.",

The menu is well suited for the stature of the restaurant.  Classic meals including duck, steak, lamb chops, pork chops and fish.  The food is good but not quite at the point of being terrific or memorable.  It will continue to satisfy the long time customers of this restaurant.  If you want a good solid meal where everyone will like something El Chorro continues to fill the bill.  I hope that as they settle in to their second life that some of those nuanced flavors that Chef Kassels was famous for in Santa Fe can emerge so that El Chorro is not just brunch on Sundays and special occassions but also a wonderfully, memorable meal.",

    "text": "On  Saturday, April 25th, my wife and I had dinner at El Chorro.  We had the Chateaubriand for two.  It was excellent, and the service was as well, other than it took a very long time to get our food.  This was due to the fact that, unfortunately, the power in the kitchen went out during our dinner.  On top of the delay in receiving our meal, we did not get dessert.  While many patrons that night were not charged for their meals, we paid for ours in full and left a generous tip.  We were told at the reception desk upon leaving that El Chorro would contact us about dessert.  No one did.  Finally my wife called the restaurant on October 1st and spoke with the general manager, Ryan.  He needs professional development in customer service.  He displayed an uncaring attitude about the fact our experience at dinner on April 25th was less than perfect.  He even told my wife that he didn't know what she expected him to do about the fact we did not get dessert, since the power outage was out of El Chorro's control.  Finally Ryan relented and said he would send us a gift card for our dessert.  It arrived - $10.  Really?  Each dessert probably costs $10.  So he sent us a gift card for one dessert.  The better approach would have been to actually care that a customer had a less than satisfactory experience, or at least act like you cared.  Maybe even discount the dinner we already paid for, or offer a free return dining experience at El Chorro.  But no, Ryan had attitude during the entire conversation and then sent us one (1) $10 gift card.  That's how he took care of the fact we got no dessert after paying over $200 for dinner.  Again, sign up for the next seminar on customer service that you can, Ryan.",

    "text": "I have been dining at El Chorro Lodge since 1974. El Chorro Lodge is a family favorite. When Joe and Evie announced there retirement and selling of El Chorro, I am grateful Mrs. Dorrance saved El Chorro from turning into Paradise Valley's next luxury home subdivision.   First and foremost, the renovations to El Chorro are fantastic! The patios have been enlarged to take advantage of the great views of Camelback Mountain, numerous fireplaces added to add to the ambiance and the charm of El Chorro preserved in the process. Kudos to the designers for saving the copper hood of the fireplace in the old dining room and relocating it to the renovated schoolroom bar! (One sad note, miss the \"Knights of the Round Table\" table that was next to old fireplace on the old main patio. Its now a service area, but time marches on!)   The entire of the new restaurant speaks of old Arizona, but in a fresh and modern way. Photos and art work of happy times at the Old El Chorro decorate the walls and is a gracious nod to the past.   The cocktail menu has been expand, and a second bar has been added with great views of Camelback Mountain. This is a terrific place to grab an old school martini or try one of their handcrafted cocktails.   Our dinner was graced with the old relish tray, served on a cold plate instead of chipped ice. (Chipped ice would have been a nicer presentation.)   Appetizers include the standard shrimp cocktail, flash fried lobster tail and new additions. Soup of the day or salad is included with the dinner entree, which is a nice touch in an ala carte world.   My girlfriend enjoyed the filet, which was tender and cooked to perfection. I enjoyed the duck breast, which was flavorful, tender and not overcooked.   Just two notes for improvements, I don't know what happened to the original recipes for the flash-fried lobster batter or the sticky buns, but please, please look for them! Some classic items just do not need improvement! Also, $5 for valet parking, please.",

    "text": "I have been coming here since 1975, when our company would have our monthly breakfast forecast meetings here.  I heard it re-opened and wanted it to come and compare it with the original.  I figured if it was almost as good, it would be pretty nice. First, the minuses.  It is overpriced.  The menu did not have the shad roe and eggs that it was somewhat known for.  The sticky rolls were nice, but they hardly gave you enough. I started out with the Cobb Salad.  There were very fresh ingredients on the salad and the ingredients were seperated so you could mix as you wish.  The dressing was Green Goddess or some form of  and it was on the side and very nice.  I also had a taste of the Eggs Benedict at the table.  This was another signature dish and did not disappoint.  El Chorro to was known for the best Eggs Benedict on the planet for years. The atmosphere here is second to none.  The view of the mountains from the patio is tremendous from the old Spanish surrounding.   I highly reccomend this restaurant to anyone.",

I'm sure the dinner menu tastes as yummy as it looks, but with their bar menu and the bocce ball court, I'm not sure why you'd ever sit down to eat!  Chowing down on their burger in between bocce ball throws, sipping a super refreshing, perfect-for-summer cocktail, and staring at some of the best views in Phoenix is the way to experience El Chorro Lodge.  This place is great for everyone: big groups, a romantic dinner, a place to eat while the kids run on the grass, or a dinner with a client.",

    "text": "BEWARE OF BAD SERVER named Angei.  (6) of us attempted to have a nice meal at El Chorro last night to kick off the first day of Arizona Restaurant Week.  This was my second visit to El Chorro and the first for everyone else.  Our server Angei appeared to be in her first hour of being employed as a server and kicked off the worst night of dining in my life by being completely clueless about Gluten allergies (my sister-in-law has a Gluten allergy).  The restaurant week menu specifically stated that there were Gluten-free options.  When we asked which options were Gluten-free she had no idea what was Gluten-free on the restaurant week menu or the regular  Gluten-free menu.   We sent her off to the kitchen to in quire about the Gluten-free option.  She came back to our table twice more in the next (20) minutes with no answer other than \"We were told the only Gluten-free option was the vegetarian pasta.\"   She actually had the nerve to ask us what would be in their own dishes that would contain Gluten.  How on earth are we to know how they prepare the menu.  She claimed that she had spoken to the chef but she obviously made that story up.  After these (2) attempts we finally demanded that she send a manager to our table.  (10) minutes later the manager arrived armed with the Gluten-free menu for El Chorro to help eliminate the confusion.  As he learned from us the confusion was on the part of Angei who had never brought us a Gluten-free menu even though we looked it up on the restaurant's own website and showed her this evidence on our iPhones.  She claimed the Gluten-free status must have been a misprint.  By this point we are now (45) minutes into the dining experience and just placing our order.  Fast forward another (45) minutes and after a combined hour and a half our young children are now starving and fussy because they are tired of sitting in a restaurant.   My wife and the (2) young children had to leave before the first course even arrived.  When departing my wife went to the front hostess and complained about the poor quality of the service and asked a manager to look into this.  No one ever came by to check on us the balance of evening.  Had they done so we would have shared our experience with them in vivid detail.  We then had everything thereafter boxed table side because Angei stated it was too difficult for the kitchen to box up the courses for my wife.  Even that process was difficult to communicate as we had to remind her to bring additional boxes and tell her it would be inadvisable to place a scoop of ice cream in a cardboard box with a hot piece of chocolate cake that we would attempt to rush to my wife (at home starving with two young kids) 30 minutes away.  Before the main course arrived she came to the table bearing news that they were out of the dessert feature we had ordered and told us they had a chocolate torte (which turned out to be a chocolate lava cake) and then asked which dessert we would like to choose.  We didn't have a choice but the torte so why ask us which option we prefer.  Torte or nothing?  When we finally received dessert my sister-in-law with the Gluten allergy thought she would enjoy the ice cream only on her dessert plate only to find that whatever utensil had been used to dish the ice cream had been previously used to dish something with a cake or cookie consistency thereby cross-contaminating Gluten into her ice cream which will most likely make her very ill in the upcoming hours.    Angei had (3) tables.  (2) were 2-tops and ours was a 6-top that became a 3-top.  Every single request (water, soda, etc.) took (10) minutes minimum to be fulfilled.  Our table was collecting spent plates, glasses, etc. that never left our sight.  The simplest of instructions seemed to be received as complex to Angei as diffusing a bomb.  We repeated our requests and answered her questions more than once on several occasions.  At the end of the night we requested that my brother and his wife have a separate check than my family only to be told that they did not have that ability but if we told her how much to put on each credit card she could do that.  She didn't seem to understand that was the same exact outcome with the only difference being that we would be responsible for sitting at the table and calculating our own bills.  The food was very good from first course to dessert but the service was the worst I have received in my life.  This individual should have been set free in a sit down restaurant where the meals were $5.00 on average.  Instead we averaged $50.00 per person and could have received better service from the bus boys.  I know that this is probably the first real weekend for the outdoor patio seating at El Chorro which looks like it doubles their capacity so perhaps Angei is one of the new players on the team, but it is completely unacceptable that any patrons, particularly first time visitors during restaurant week, be treated to sub-par service like this.",

The food looked really good and I love restaurants with a nice patio and a lot of history, so I thought this place would be a hit. We went there for brunch and the patio was really nice with a great view of Cammelback Mountain. The food was the biggest disappointment. The prices are really high, which I don't mind if the food is worth the price, yet that wasn't the case here. I had the Cobb Salad and the chicken was cold and it was just okay. I was expecting more out of a $15 salad. (FYI - Charleston's Cobb Salad is a-mazing and cheaper!) They also give you a \"bread\" basket before your entrees come out, and it's more like a \"dessert\" basket which is cool but the scones and sticky buns were just okay. My fiance had a breakfast burrito which was huge but it wasn't anything to get excited about. Our waiter was pretty stale too... and it had the pretentious Scottsdale vibe to it.",

    "text": "Went to El Chorro last night for dinner with my boyfriend and my mom that is visiting from out of town. I have been SO excited to try this restaurant since moving here, but was sadly disappointed.  The waiter we had seemed as if he had better things to do and was rushing us the entire time. When I come to a restaurant like this with prices like El Chorro I expect the staff to be patient and able to appreciate the process of \"fine dining\". He would ask a question and then before you could answer would start to walk away that I had to call after him for a glass if wine. Water glasses were refilled once the entire meal and he didn't take the opportunities to add on to any of the orders. The meal: For dinner we had the Filets and the spare ribs. The filets were cooked well (medium rare) and were tasty. My boyfriend felt his was something we could have made at home in our Crock Pot, so that was disappointing for the price.  When the food came out we realized the waiter had ordered 3 filets and the short ribs  (for three people??) that we then had to wait another 10 minutes at the end of the meal for the opportunity to flag him down to remove the extra meal (that the food runner had said he was going to take off since he showed up with four meals).   Lastly, at the end of our meal we were told only the special dessert option, when asked if he had other options he acted again very annoyed but got menus and returned. We ordered two Strawberry shortcakes and the brownie sundae. Again, as he started rushing away after hearing the food options we had to call out to him to ask if they had coffee. I thought the offer of coffee and/or tea was pretty standard at any restaurant.... But who knows! The shortcake came out with a nice presentation, but the lack of strawberries for a strawberry shortcake was mind boggling!! So it was like 5 slices of strawberries and strawberry syrup which also does not represent their description of \"fresh strawberries\". The brownie was good, though as my boyfriend said, \"it's hard to mess up a brownie.\"  Needless to say I was very disappointed with this place and will not be back. The food was alright but the service or lack there of doesn't make the price worth it!",

There is a beautiful fountain as you walk into the courtyard (minus the yard) which is made up of two large patios. We chose to sit outside even though it was still quite warm out because the atmosphere and view outside was much more appealing. They have live music set up on the patio that is to your right as you walk in so if you want a bit more of a quiet atmosphere sit on the patio along Lincoln Rd.   After we ordered they came out with a relish tray, which consisted of cold olives, radishes, broccoli, cauliflower, celery sticks, carrot sticks and some peppers. The sticky buns were brought out at the same time and were pretty good, but quickly got a bit hard and were almost inedible. We both had a French onion soup which had pieces of steak in it as our starter. It was pretty good, but after I noticed a couple of patrons with the house salad I wished I had ordered that instead. For diner Mike had the pepper crusted sirloin with frites and I had the pork chop with a green chile risotto and green beans. The servings were pretty big so we were definitely not leaving here hungry.  However, nothing really stood out about our meals. Mike commented that he couldn't even taste the pepper on the steak and that the steak was pretty bland. He immediately asked our waiter for some A-1. My pork chop was pretty good. It came with a salsa relish on top. If it wasn't for the salsa my dish would have been pretty bland for the most part as well. The risotto was ok. Lastly for dessert we both had the chocolate cake with ice cream. The cake was a little rich for me so I had trouble finishing it, but it was pretty good.   The food was ok. However, it's not worth the regular price.  For restaurant week it was a decent deal. The service was great. Our water glasses were constantly being filled and plates taken away in a timely manner.   Skip dinner here and come and enjoy happy hour at their outside bar and partake in the amazing view.",

I ordered the breakfast burrito and it was mostly a tough, chewy, gummy tortilla with dry scrambled flavorless eggs inside. There was some dry stringy mystery meat inside. Ate about one fourth of it. Thank God for the sticky buns or it would have been a total loss.",

    "text": "We dined at El Chorro on a rainy night so we did valet mainly for the umbrella. I was told by the greeter to leave it at the front door and upon returning it was gone. We were seated right next to a leaky roof with a constant patter, very distracting.  As they staff tried to fix the issue right in the middle of dinner service. Service was very slow as servers are busy with big parties that are also saeted in the main dining. I was charged for 2 soft drinks when all I did was switch from the flat 7up to coke, and they brought me diet and we had to flag down the server to get it switched. Apps. were great and the sticky buns good. I ordered the strougnouff and it was full of onions which was not in the menu description.  For 30$, it did not live up to its expectations.  Finally, we were served dessert with dirty dishes still on our table but all we could do was stare at it as utensils were MIA.  Overall, very disappointed!!",

From the moment we arrived the front desk staff up to the Management were extremely professional and friendly. We ordered the pan roasted giant shrimp for our appetizer and the seasonal wild salmon and short ribs for our entrees. They were delicious!! We especially enjoyed the sticky buns. El Chorro has the most beautiful patio dining and friendly staff, and we look forward to coming back soon.",

    "text": "For my birthday, I found myself struggling between a favorite standby-restaurant or somewhere new... I'm so glad I gave my boyfriend the go-ahead to surprise me with a new place because I was blown away by El Chorro!  We had a rather late meal with some of our best friends visiting us from out of town, making our reservations for around 8PM. When we arrived, the ambiance was already set with twinkling lights, roaring outdoor fires and a beautiful patio. It was brisk and I'd forgotten my coat, but upon being seated, I realized that heaters were keeping the patio quite warm. (Hooray!)  To start, we shared the sausage platter (which was AWESOME) and a shrimp pepper pot. They were each wonderful, and we finished them both! The sausages were my favorite, particularly with the great artisanal mustards they include. We caught up over a bottle of wine, ordered our meals and were surprised when we suddenly got a big basket of sticky buns! (We had no idea that the place was famous for these - we sort of thought someone else's dessert had been dropped off at our table!)  When we were sure they were ours, we dug in and they were phenomenal! A little strange to have between the appetizer and meal because they seem so dessert'y, but who am I to turn down sweet pastries? (Umm, bring it on!) We asked our waiter about the sticky buns, and he gave us the most interesting back story about the restaurant, the Marlboro man and some elephants that he trained using the sticky buns! I have no idea how much of it was True, but it was entertaining and made the restaurant's staple even more enjoyable!  For my main course, I had a seafood pasta that was out of this WORLD. Seriously, if you're a shellfish lover, this is the way to go. It was -awesome-. Our server was kind enough to even bring out a small birthday dessert, which we all shared (and still couldn't finish, as we were so full!) All in all, the food was 5-star, the ambiance 5-star, and the night couldn't have been better! It was the perfect evening with some great friends - thanks, El Chorro!",

We all laughed and said he was being dramatic...that is until we tried it and realized that it was dry and tasted like a Salisbury steak. The outside patio was nice but def not worthy of a 4 star yelp rating. We should've known better since we called in at 5pm that night and we're still able to get an 8:00 reservation. There are def better eatery options in the area.",

From the staff who greeted us kindly at the door to our server Nate who made spot-on recommendations to Sean the General Manager who treated us as though we were VIPs, we couldn't have enjoyed it more.   Started with a moderately priced bottle of The Prisoner red wine that was velvety but not sweet or too tart.  Then those delicious rolls!  The house salad was fresh and crisp and the dressing an indescribable delight of bright grapefruit and buttery garlic. Our entrees were Scottish Salmon cooked perfectly on a bed of orzo and corn.  Also had the braised shortribs ( a house specialty and deservedly so), heirloom tomatos, broasted chicken that our friend said was the most amazing combination of juicy meat and crispy exterior, and the vegetarian dish with polenta and eggplant that our vegan friend found perfect for her palate.  Desserts - a blueberry handpie, the beet ginger cake as light and airy as Nate said it was, and my favorite, chocolate mousse that was a melange of chocolate flavors and textures that allowed the flavor and not the sugar to shine. All in all, a terrific experience that we plan to repeat.  Thanks for a great night, El Chorro!",

And we didn't go away hungry by any means. We had poutine, fried shrimp, crispy chicken livers (2), vegetables w/ hummus, crispy cheese curds, beef sliders, and 3 glasses of wine. Happy hour seating is limited and was pretty much packed while we were there. The facility is beautiful. The service was very good. I would like to go back for brunch, while not inexpensive it would be a good chance to experience a different part of the restaurant. As a majority of the seating seems to be outside, spring and fall would seem to be the best time to visit.",

She preferred to huddle with the other servers and chat rather than serve drinks.    The food was mediocre.  I had the burrata and tomato salad.  It is prime tomato season and they were flavorless and underripe.  I was surprised they were served.  The truffle fries were something I would expect to see from a Chili's or TGI Friday's; covered in grated cheese.  The rest of the meal followed suit.  The plates were expensive for the quality which was lacking.      The front desk staff was friendly.  The flowers on the patio were nice and the local art on the walls was fun.

It's a patio at 4:30 in the afternoon. He insisted we leave.  When we asked that her drink ( which she never had the opportunity to enjoy) be taken off the bill, his response was \"I can't do that\".

I had the trout almondine and the boy had the filet - YUM! The service was attentive and friendly,  the birthday dessert was delicious and enough to share. If you get a chance, try the Gin Rickey cocktail - almost too easy to drink ;) We can't wait to come back!",

Was there a few weeks ago on 4th of July. Enjoyed the 5-6:30 pm Happy Hour drink & food specials. Talked to the bartender about some of the history of the restaurant, very cool. I decided to give El Chorro 5 stars, even though I was disappointed in their dry slider buns. It's just too cool a place not to give it 5. Other beautiful restaurants/resorts in the area should take note and also offer awesome happy hours. I love it and will be going back as often as I can.",

My son and I both had the ahi Tuna - his was perfect mine was cooked perfectly but was cold as was the rice so I sent it back - then a rude person ( manager?) brought out my new one and it was way over cooked - probably took mine back and put it in the microwave- she indicated \"heres your hot ahi and were not going to charge you\" hey charge me just bring what I ordered ...anyway I didn't want to send it back again as the others at my table were almost done... My wife's Trout was superb. I would try it again but when I'm dropping $500 for dinner for 5 with wine I expect good service and good food - don't do me any favors by not charging me for first cold then way overlooked ahi.. Everyone but the person who brought my second plate out was nice - she should stay in back.",

Walking into the restaurant I instantly feel in love with the atmosphere. While spending time in Arizona the last thing I want to do is eat inside, therefore all of the open outside seating was perfect. Our waiter, John was absolutely amazing. He had character that kept us laughing, was very knowledge about the restaurant (both the menu items and the history) and handled the delay in our food very well (the kitchen was understaffed). For dinner I enjoyed the seasoned wild salmon (with steamed asparagus instead of rice) and my tastebuds went crazy. The company I shared the meal with enjoyed the wedge salad, Cobb salad, stroganoff and the soup of the day (clam chowder). The wedge salad was even noted to be the best wedge salad she had ever eaten! Though our waiter John handled the 1.5 delay on our food with poise and class, it was disappointing when there was not any deduction to our bill for the lengthy wait. Regardless, the food and atmosphere was amazing and I would return.",

Poor guy had no help with as big as our party was even applebees would have two waiters helping out. Our drinks were always empty steaks came out cold, baked potatoes where brought out after meals were finished. I complained to the manager and he said he would bring out complimentary desserts he said he would cover the table.  We waited and only four desserts came out when there was 12 of us.  extra plates and silverware was brought out until later. Then he left and didn't leave any thing to serve it with. O and did I mention the steak sucked its usually really good here but not today not impressed at all!",

So when I got there with my family we were about to be seated until this scumbag 20 year old douchebag came up to us and said \"There's no way you can bring that dog in\" and I said well the lady said I could bring a dog. And keep in mind that this is a small 10 pound harmless dog. Then the guy looked at us like it was our fault and we did something wrong. It wasn't our fault, it was the 20 year old idiot lady that didn't know the policy. Then they kicked us out and we spent an hour and a half looking for another restaurant. After that, we couldn't find any more places that didn't have crazy drunk people so we ended up going back to the resort. After an hour and a half of driving, we didn't want to eat anymore so we had to starve until we had airplane food at 4:00 AM. I wish I could've gave this 0 stars. This restaurant is just filled with a bunch of idiots that don't have brains. They didn't even apologize to us. So because of those stupid douche bags, our last day of vacation was ruined. THANKS EL CHORO",

We requested a table in front of the fireplace and were told the table is reserved for birthdays and anniversaries. Ok. We were fine with that.  A little strange since there were very few people in the restaurant but we understood their policy. It was when we asked for plain rolls that we were taken back. The waitress was professional and very kind and explained there was a $7.00 up charge for \"plain\" rolls. El Chorro is famous for their stickey rolls. We said that was fine but the more I thought about it, the more this disturbs me. Really, a charge for different (and plain to boot) for 4 rolls. You do the math. This is not about money, it is about charging for a change in roll preference. Really shocking and disappointing that a restaurant of this caliber would need to charge for such a small thing. Maybe they could re-evaluate this decision.  With so many great restaurants in the valley to choose from, we are thinking it will be a long time to return since they need to charge for such a small request.",

Not this time. We ate on the patio, starting with happy hour. Service started out OK, and deteriorated. This was not a busy night. Midweek, not crowded. Our waitress pretty much disappeared. Food and drinks took forever to get out, we had to ask others to get our server or help us.   One diner ordered the duck, the duck was raw. I finally got the hostess to find someone to take away this mass of bloody flesh from the poor woman who had to stare at it and smell it.    I called to complain the next day, spoke with the manager. He listened, said he would have the manager responsible call me. Have still not received a call.   Go at your own risk. You might have great service or you might have this. This trip was so bad it completely ruined my previous great review of El Chorro. I won't be going back.",

    "text": "This has always been one of my favorite restaurants in the Valley. It reflects the feeling of Old Phoenix and it makes you feel like you are visiting your friend's beautiful southwestern estate. Plus, I could probably eat a dozen of their sticky buns in one sitting. When we were planning the wedding and looking for a rehearsal dinner location, we immediately thought of El Chorro.   They have multiple areas for private parties, the atmosphere is lovely, the restaurant has a lot of character and the backdrop is just stunning with the restaurant being nestled against the north side of Camelback Mountain. El Chorro lived up to expectations! We had about 40 guests attend the rehearsal dinner and we had a combination of an indoor and outdoor event. They set up several tables with nice linens outside while twinkle lights light up the area. We also had the indoor area that had dark wooden paneling and felt like a beautiful southwestern home.   The servers were friendly, the drinks flowed and the food was simply phenomenal. We had a buffet style set-up with a combination of Mexican food, a meat station, a slider station and french fries! It was elegant comfort food at its finest. I personally think that this is one of the best (if not the best) locations for a rehearsal dinner!",

We were first introduce to El Chorro by my parents 30 years ago and it is our favorite resultant in Arizona and we have been accused by some of traveling from Chicago to Phoenix just to have dinner.   The night was awesome! The restaurant was packed as usual and we had a 8 pm reservation. We were seated on the patio which we requested at 7;50. Our waiter Leo was awesome! He was super knowledgable about the menu and anticipated our every need. Our food as usual was outstanding. As a starter we had the shrimp pepper pot, outstanding. For our second course we ordered four different items for a good sampling. We had a bowl of New England Clam Chowder, wedge salad, tomato salad and the beet salad. We sent back 4 clean plates. Next the sticky buns, Epic!! As our main course my wife had the short rib with mustard seed infused whipped potatoes, I had the beef stroganoff and my sons each had the New York Strip steak. Everything was perfect from presentation to temperature. Again we sent back for clean plates. The dining experience was capped off with one more round of sticky buns for the men while my wife enjoyed the strawberry shortcake.   El Chorro is a True 5 star dining experience in a beautiful spotless setting and receives my highest recommendation.",

The grounds were beautiful, the weather spectacular and the delicious cuisine paired with flawless service completed the package. Julia ( from Philly), our server , was quite personable and very knowledgeable on the menu, wine pairings and the history of the property. We will request her when we return to this restaurant. (Even though we live 300 miles away)   I had the locavore beet salad with goat cheese - beautiful presentation and delicious. Entree was halibut with Pasilla chili-lime beurre blanc sauce - show stopper.   Finished our meal with an expertly prepared cappuccino and a walk around the grounds and appreciated the historical photographs.",

The view was breathtaking,, since Camelback mountain is right at your front door. Great evening out,, and the bill??? very reasonable.  Trust me try this place,, you will love it.

I wish it was warmer outside so that we could have sat on the patio. We started with the raved about sticky buns, SO. GOOD. We got them as an app but I would recommend them for dessert :) but then again, I would eat them whenever, they were that good. Then for my main course, I got the salmon, my boyfriend and his dad split the Chateaubriand for two & his mom got the pork. Everyone was very satisfied with everything. I would definitely come back here. It is a little pricey so I would save it for a special occasion :)",

Eggs  Benedict on an English Muffin that could  not  be cut with a steak knife,  chicken tenders totally dried up and inedible.Bus persons left dirty dishes on table until they we  asked to have them removed.  And to top it off, American valet parking  which took up all the close spots  so that with a handicapped sticker we were obliged  to pay $5.00 parking  or walk from  back  parking lot. None of it set well, probably  the last time for  this place I used to love. Too many  other places  to choose  from.",

Last time I was here was in 1998 - I won't forget because I was in town on business and had dinner with my dad, in order to tell him I was pregnant with his grandbaby. It was a favorite restaurant of my dad and step-mom, and they took me there a few times when I came to town. It never made that much of an impression on me...felt a bit tired. Then, when we came to town last month, I was catching up with an old girlfriend who had just moved to Phoenix. She had El Chorro on her list of places to try, so hubby and I decided it would be fun to go with her and invite my dad.  We all had a lovely evening. The waiters were extremely helpful. I got the trout amandine and everyone else ordered some meat things (yeah meat thing names escape me). The trout was absolutely delicious and everyone loved their meals as well. My dad mentioned something about the sticky buns to the waiter at the beginning and they were brought out almost immediately. Strange before dinner...but good.   It's pretty pricey so that would be my biggest hesitation. But for food and atmosphere, I'd definitely return!",

That was a mistake. 1 tb spoon Gorgonzola dressing on the wedge, small thin piece of cold halibut and I thought the dry \"Petit Fours\" size dessert on the plate was a joke. Wait staff (Nate) was dismissive and added a 20% tip to our ticket for party of two.... joking sarcastically that it was added because we chose the Restaurant Week menu, \"but you can double the gratuity if you'd like!\" I remember now why I didn't go for 20 yrs. I don't need to go again. Go instead to Capital Grille or to Ocean Prime. You will be much happier and get a MUCH better meal... throughout the year.",

Beware- happy hour is only outside or at the bar.  I think the food is good, but not 5 star worthy. I haven't been blown away by anything I've had (save the glory that are the sticky buns), but the food is solid.   What really makes El Chorro great is the overall atmosphere. The staff are great, the restaurant has a cozy and rustic feel, and the views of Camelback are gorgeous.",

Service was outstanding as our special requests were graciously accommodated, even on this busy night.  Our food was first class, especially the crab & tuna dynamite appetizers, the roasted lamb shank, beef stroganoff and crab oscar topped center cut filet.  Cocktails & wine were also excellent.  Unfortunately, there was no room left for dessert, but they looked wonderful!  Ryan was our server and provided incredible service.  Thank you for a wonderful evening!",

    "text": "The grounds at El Chorro are delightful. They have a beautiful and relaxing patio. There are a lot of desert plants and trees. The restaurant has been open since about 1937 and there is an interesting history to learn about. The dining rooms are nostalgic of an earlier time in the desert. I ordered Brussel Sprout, Kale & Parmesean Salad.  The salad was quite delicious. It had roasted pepitas, almonds, dried cranberries and a Champagne Vinaigrette. I also ordered a Grilled Petite Filet with Brandied Dianne Sauce. The steak was very flavorful and was accompanied with mashed potatoes and French Green Beans. I picked out a dessert that was a Spiced Chocolate Tart with Espresso Creme Anglaise and Passionfruit sauce. It was very enjoyable.  A friend was with me and also ordered a Petite Fliet. Her steak had a huge chunk of gristle that was fat and two inches long. That is not enjoyable in the steak; especially when it is petite.  I figure the steaks are probably hand cut but in an establishment like this with a hefty price the meal should be perfect.  The manager kept passing by our table and didn't visit our table until he was flagged down. We noticed he visited tables all around the room and even outside on the patio but, it felt like he wanted to avoid our table.  A good manager would be aware of what is happening in the dining room and I would expect he would be proactive to address an issue rather than ignore guests.  I think the price is very expensive and the premium price should be met with premium service and a premium meal too.  We shouldn't be flagging a manager down and hearing the manager make excuses like we did.  I have dinned in other restaurants where the service was exceptional.",

    "text": "Came here on a Valentines Day date to check out their 3 course meal.  El Chorro has been since the early 1900's, but became a restaurant fairly recent.  The place is charming and has a historical past with some nostalgic story behind the scene.  It definitely has some history and an Arizonian feel giving you a homey feel.  For our food were treated with their famous sticky buns while we ordered a bottle of wine along with it.  The sticky buns was to me just warm cinnamon roll.  I wasn't too particularly too sure what the rave was but okay.  For starters my date went for the Dungeness Crab salad and I ordered their Potato Leek Veloute.  The crab salad was nothing all too inspiring, it was difficult to find some crab or avocado among the other ingredients of mango, arugula, fennel, and edible flowers; I think if it was larger in size the ingredients would shine, but would have been more of an entree salad by then.  My potato leek soup was probably my favorite of the night.  Nice creamy texture of the potato soup and whipped beets and mild hint of sweetness.  For our entree my date ordered the filet steak and I shot for the sea bass.  The filet was cooked to perfection and came with a peppercorn demi-glace; overall nothing too spectacular, but good.  My sea bass was well seasoned and came with a fun olive citrus sauce, and whole olives that gave it some texture.  Again, well cooked and the olive citrus was cool.  To finish I ordered the Strawberry Scone Shortcake and my partner went for the Oreo Chocolate Cream Tart.    To end, service was on top of things and attentive.  The place is lovely and I can see why it would make a great wedding venue, which it is.  Overall, the food was well seasoned and well cooked, but I guess I wanted more whimsical and fun especially during Valentines Day -- Enjoy!",

    "text": "I went here with my family for Easter brunch. While I was impressed with the food, I was very disappointed with the service.   They offered a great brunch - Eggs Benedict, Bananas Foster French Toast, cheese blintzes, bacon, cheese, meats, salmon, salads - it was great. There was a very nice selection. They also had amazing desserts, like a lemon blueberry cheesecake, colorful cookies, and various other small treats like tarts and cinnamon rolls. The mimosa I ordered was perfect! Just the right amount of OJ to bubbles.   However, our service was awful. Our waitress acted like she couldn't be bothered to come to our table, let alone fill up our waters or get a drink order. I was there for over 45 minutes before someone asked me what I would like to drink besides water. Additionally, when we asked for something, it took FOREVER for it to be brought to the table. I finally gave up trying to order a second mimosa, because I didn't want to wait another hour to get it. And when it came time to pay the bill, our waitress acted like she didn't possibly understand how to split the check. She was very rude and rolled her eyes when we finally convinced her to split it - we just wanted to split it down the middle, nothing fancy. I was really disappointed by that because it was a great experience otherwise, her attitude just ruined it. I will say that the manager walking around was helpful, and without him I don't think we would have gotten any service at all.   For the most part, though, the atmosphere is great. The outside seating was wonderful and the surrounding area is beautiful - it's very green and well kept.",

The restaurant is beautiful, offering stunning views of Camelback and Mummy Mountain. Dining is available inside, or covered outside seating with portable air conditioners. We chose to dine inside.  When we sat down we were immediately served some fresh sticky buns and croissants. The sticky buns were warm, gooey, and delicious, everything you could want in a sticky bun. We each ordered a mimosa that seemed to be the perfect balance of orange juice and champagne.  My fiance ordered the two eggs for breakfast, which came with bacon, potatoes, and an arugula salad. I ordered the omelette of the day, which was a carne asade omelette with peppers and mushrooms. The omelette also came with potatoes and salad.  Overall we were very pleased with the food and service. The wait staff was super friendly, the front desk was super friendly, we felt at home. El Chorro highly recommended for anyone looking for an upscale brunch experience complete with sticky buns.",

    "text": "This review is specifically for Easter Brunch.  Ambience: 5 stars - It really doesn't get any lovelier than El Chorro's patio on a warm spring day Service: 5+++ stars - Seating & flow were planned to perfection, our server & busser were fantastic, the valet was quick and polite. Food: 3.75 stars - What was served was very good, especially the seafood dishes. However, I wasn't a fan of the prime rib; it had nice flavor but was too fatty. I would have enjoyed more variety/healthier options and I was surprised to see very few spring vegetables. Although I'm not a dessert person, there was a wide selection for every palate. Value: 4.5 stars - Brunch prices were more affordable than other restaurants of this caliber, we were happy with what we paid. A complimentary mimosa, bloody mary etc. would've made this a 5 star value.  From the minute you walk up to the tree flanked and blooming entrance, El Chorro just feels like the perfect place for an Easter Brunch. Everyone was dressed in Arizona chic; flowy fabrics and floral colors dominated the day as it approached 90 degrees. Despite the full booking, we were checked in immediately and taken directly to our seats - an outside table as requested, fully shaded by umbrellas.    Right away I was impressed by the attention that had been paid to planning this busy holiday meal. Tables were spaced generously, staff was plentiful, and the buffet was set out in duplicate with multiple entrances and exits.  We never waited for refills or for plates to be cleared, nor did we ever feel rushed.  Our server was warm and personable, she asked my son about his Easter basket and was always on hand for drinks, clean forks, etc.  As we approached the end of the designated brunch hours, buffet dishes were still full and there was no indication that it was time to leave.  My favorite dish was the salmon - delicate, light and lemony. I don't think I've ever had salmon at a buffet where it wasn't dry and overcooked. This was perfection.  Two of the salads were also stand-outs.  The shrimp salad with celery and nuts was creamy without being heavy and filled generously with fresh bay shrimp.  I also enjoyed the interesting slaw with feta, jicama, and some kind of fruit I think? Whatever it was it was bursting with unique, fresh flavor and great texture. The frittata and eggs benedict were also very good if a bit heavy for the heat of the day. As for the bacon - it was delicious.  I know it's hard to mess up bacon but this was thick cut and exceptionally meaty. Yum!    I have to give a special high five to the El Chorro Bloody Mary.  It's spicy, tangy, cool refreshment - and comes with a meal on a stick!  Balancing precariously above the glass, a fresh, gargantuan shrimp takes this cocktail over the top. Along with huge olives and peppers, the \"liquid\" lunch could be making a comeback at El Chorro.  Overall, I was very impressed with our brunch at El Chorro. The planning and service were top notch and we felt very cared for from start to finish.",

All of the happy hour appetizers are only $5.  --------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Fried Chicken Liver $5 - I personally love chicken liver and so I liked this dish! I personally prefer the larger pieces so that you get more of the liver taste rather than the breading taste. The bacon marmalade with it is delicious!  Southwestern Poutine $5 - This appetizer is just some thin fries with cheese and sauce on top. I made the mistake of thinking it would be like Canadian poutine with gravy.  Famous Sticky Buns $5 - You get 4 sticky buns, one sticky bun is about the palm of your hand size. These sticky buns are DELICIOUS, I can see why everyone raves about them so much. They are made with a nice caramel sauce/taste with a good amount of cinnamon spread on the inside of the bun swirls. You cannot come to El Chorro without trying their sticky buns.  Margarita $5 wine $3  I absolutely love the decor and atmosphere here. It is like a country club with amazing outdoor seating which is perfect for Arizona weather. The service is great as well, I had a great time at El Chorro. I would definitely recommend coming for happy hour if you don't want to splurge on the high prices of the dinner size entrees.",

    "text": "We came here during Restaurant Week for a special family dinner out. The location and facility are beautiful, the food is excellent, and the service was fantastic.   First off, it is brilliant that they include the brunch menu along with the dinner menu. Everyone got excited about the brunch offerings, so I guess we'll have to go back to try that.   Our waiter, Colin, and the other waitstaff were always on it: refilling drinks, clearing plates, and ensuring that everything about our meal was to our liking. We browsed the regular menu, but both my wife and I decided to order off the Restaurant Week menu so that we could try a wide variety of things. The kids both ordered off the kids menu (one had chicken fingers+fries and the other had macaroni and cheese -- nobody said they're adventurous eaters!)  My wife had a beef filet with mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach. She said the steak was cooked well and the potatoes were good, but she did not enjoy the spinach as much. She had a salad to start. I think it was a Caesar. The polenta \"croutons\" were something different.  To start, I had the soup of the day, which was a green chile stew with pork. It had a bit of spice to it and was FANTASTIC. If that is on the day's menu and you enjoy green chiles, I highly recommend it.  For my main, I ordered the pork tenderloin with bacon risotto and asparagus (see the picture!). Why have more pork right after the pork stew when I could have had beef? Honestly, the bacon risotto hooked me, and it was SO worth it. Creamy, bacon-y and delicious, it was a perfect accompaniment to the asparagus and tenderloin. The tenderloin had a nice crust on it and was cooked nicely in the middle, if just a slight bit more done than I make mine. People tend to like their pork more well done than I do, so that's to be expected and I thoroughly enjoyed it.   For dessert, one of us got the chocolate cake and the other the strawberry shortcake. Both were presented nicely... but I did not get pictures. People dug into them too quickly and my phone is old. The chocolate cake was moist and just the right amount of chocolatey. I liked the accompanying berries and whipped cream. The shortcake was a little dry, but the abundance of strawberry compote and whipped cream more than made up for it. In fact, the cake being a little dry allowed it to soak up more of the strawberry goodness, which was OK by me.   I was called the next day by a member of the management, Lorenzo, I believe, to ask if everything was to my liking and if I wanted to provide any feedback. I thought that was nice and told him that we had a great experience and we would definitely be coming back.",

My husband and I went out for dinner on Christmas Day. I spent a lot of time researching places that were open. We didn't want a buffet, but we would have been better off at Denny's.  First, they sat us outside as it was a beautiful day. The fire was crackling, it was wonderful, except that our table was right next to where all the service staff hung out, so we could hear them talking. Much more desirable tables were all around us and empty during the entire 2 hours we were there.  Second, our onion soup was brought out lukewarm. When we find someone to bring us another, I don't get a soup spoon and no one offers ground pepper.  Third, the main course: my turkey and mashed potatoes are lukewarm and my husband's filet is well-done! They take both plates back and start over. It's fixed -- although I swear the mashed potatoes are right out of a box.  Fourth, I order pecan tart, and it tastes like something brought in from the frozen food section of Safeway. It doesn't taste like anything I'd serve at home.  All this for $70 per person + taxes and tip! I would never go back to that restaurant. It's a shame because it's so pretty, but it's beauty is just skin deep.",

Ordered a drink inside at the bar while waiting for my Meetup group, about 30 of us.  Wasn't sure which patio we were meeting on, so I asked my server, she didn't know.  5 minutes later, I ask to close out.  She informed me that since I'm part of a large group it's one tab.  I'm inside, sitting alone, and she refused to let me pay?  Brings a \"manager\" to explain it to me.  There are 2 guys sitting at the bar.  I ask \"Do they get separate checks?\".  No, they'll only split it down the middle.  Also, policy is any 6 or more people it's 25% gratuity.  So, bring your friends, just pretend like you don't know each other.  Server gave me lip, so no tip.  That's my policy.  Finally get my check & was charged full price for my so-called happy hour drink.  Maybe that's another wacky policy they have.  Been to Meetups all over the Valley.  Never had this happen.  Our organizer confirmed it all in advance, but El Chorro would rather choke on its policies.  Anyway, I'm glad it did.  Hadn't checked out the Hearth 61 bar across the street at the new Mountain Shadows.  Beautiful!  They welcomed us with open arms, lovely service, separate checks & no lip.",

    "text": "How do you enjoy dinner outside in Arizona? Outdoor Air Conditioning! Yup for real!  This place earns 5 stars for; atmosphere, cuisine, environment, selection and service!  The setting is out of a movie set. Outdoors is shady, cool, and wonderfully landscaped.  We enjoyed the trout, short rib and pork tenderloin as entrees. Sticky buns began the experience followed with lobster bisque, shrimp pepper pot and a great salad. If you are a Tequila snob, like me, you will have to settle with my favorite, readily available, 1942 as their top shelf selection.   As a foodie, I am rarely impressed. This place was a solid five stars. Phillip from Iowa lead our wait staff team. He knew the history of the venue, the details of the preparation of our dinner as well as how to politely not interrupt a table conversation. As usual I asked the head waiter to select my entire meal. He agreed and delivered perfectly. Next up...  Double fudge browny Sunday to finish.  Wow!",

The restaurant was SO hot that we asked if they can turn the air conditioner on 2 times. I ordered the lobster bites. They tasted like something you would buy at a local Popeyes. It was overpriced, cheap looking and tasting. I also ordered the salad which was pretty tasteless. Nothing about El Chorro's dinner said come back and eat again.",

    "text": "Come for the ambiance, not the food!  Being Chicago foodies, restaurants have a hard time living up to our standards. We started with the anchovy Caesar, lump crab and tuna poke, lobster Mac'n cheese and crispy chicken livers - mediocre at best. When I can create and serve better food at home and I'm not the worlds greatest cook, you know the food is ehhhh. Everything was very bland. Barely any flavors in all the dishes.   We all were praying our entrees would be better. We had the fire roasted shrimp w garlic and pine nut risotto. The shrimp were excellent, I'm sad the risotto was made with goat cheese (and I eat everything but Goat cheese!). Being such a pungent flavor, they may want to add that to the menu description. The seafood pasta week and needed seasoning, Mediterranean chicken dry, dry, dry. The best was the fresh catch of the day (Mahi) and that too was just ok.   After trying all the dishes mentioned above and not one stood out, it's disappointing. I could have bought a great handbag for the price of dinner, but it's not the loss of money that's the bummer, it was the whole aesthetics of the food experience that left us sad :((   The best part was actually the wine, and that was served lukewarm.",

The server arrived quickly and was very enthusiastic and spend time explaining the menu and the history of the restaurant. We ordered a starter of Chicken livers and then Beef Stroganoff and the Short Ribs for the main course. The chicken livers were not crispy and came very small amount of sauce. They were very ordinary. Neither the Short ribs nor the Stroganoff had any taste of seasonings or wine, and they both were very greasy. They tasted as if they had been cooked the day before. Things only went down hill from there. The server did come back to check on us and then she completely disappeared. We ran out of water and finally we had to go to the the front desk to ask for the bill. Truly, the worst fine dining experience we have ever had. The restaurant called several days later to inquire about our experience. When I told her how disappointed we were she'd stated that the manager would call us. We have never heard from him.",

As it was a holiday I did not bulk at the $70/person fee, however if I am spending that kind of $ for a dinner I have expectations for food quality and service. The service was below average even for a buffet. We were not greeted as we set down and no one bothered to check if we needed drinks or to explain the layout of the dinner. Our server finally showed up 1/2 through after we asked for a glass of wine.  The only other time we saw her was with the check.  The food on the buffet was generally good. The beef tenderloin was rare and juicy, but the turkey and salmon were dry. The veggies and salad fixings were tasty however.   The wine and liquor list was good with enough variety to please most patrons.  Overall I might return on a regular night to give it another try but at regular $$. There are definitely better options in the area to patronize",

When we arrived we had our pick of sitting outside or inside, and chose outside to watch the sunset. The sat us at probably the worst table right next to the wait staff area when the place was totally dead. I ordered a cup of the lobster corn bisque, which had okay flavor but the corn was practically raw and there were zero lobster chunks in the soup. The sticky buns were the only thing that lived up to the hype. During the middle of our dinner a manager and three waiters had to have a conversation about some VIP they were seating near us and kept going on and on about how special he is and deserves the best treatment, while we on the other hand had no service at all and had to sit and listen to this. Meanwhile back by the waiting station all of the wait staff kept complaining about the tables they were getting and we had to listen to that all night too. Overall the service is what ruined the experience and I likely won't go back because of it.",

El Chorro made it to my list after watching it on the Food Netowrk's 'Best Thing I Ever Ate' for it's famous Sticky Buns.....  And i must say...It didn't disappoint....  We drove to the place using my GPS. I thought it was one of those little hole in the wall places that were small and odd looking from the outside... BUT!!!!! as we drove along Paradise Valley, we saw mansions....resorts, estates....it felt like a different country.. a rich people's road definitely...and then we saw the sign \"El Chorro that led up to a driveway with a parking lot and the restaurant well lit with a little valet roundabout inside.....  Felt like we were underdressed in denim shorts, and flat sandals and a tank top for me; and plain shorts, a collared shirts and slippers for my boyfriend... Walked in and found a little fountain and an outside dining area with diners happily dining... We were asked by the hostess if we had a reservation; i merely replied that \"oh, we're just here to try the Sticky Buns\"... and just coz i didnt want to wait for a table...we opted to sit at the bar.....  Our sticky buns came in a little basket platter. I thought it was one cinnamon roll for each of us... It came out warm and soft and doughy...with al the gooey goodness that just melts in your mouth and makes you want to eat more and more and more....I'm really not a fan of anything cinnamon-y.... it makes me sneeze and dizzy. However their sticky buns is an exception as it just has the right amount of sweetness and there's not too strong of that cinnamon flavor that overpowers the taste of the dough.  we were chatting it up with the bartender and he mentioned that El Chorro had a new owner and the old owners sold their recipe for the Sticky Buns....   It was indeed perfect.  The ambiance of the restaurant was very romantic; very intimate...it's very perfect for a reception.... I would definitely come back here to try their dinner menu and of course... make sure i leave room for the Sticky Buns.....",

We ordered the burrata appetizer and it was done perfectly. We couldn't wait for our entree.  Then it came. We had ordered the lamb which came over a mashed potato type side. I couldn't even eat it. It was not good at all. The lamb was overcooked and lacked flavor. The side underneath it had a weird aftertaste. It was so disappointing. Everyone at our table agreed that their meals were also a letdown. The night was leading up to this phenomenal meal and it let us down. Maybe this was an isolated incident, but maybe this place survives on it's beauty and location.",

    "text": "Just got home from another dinner at El Chorro.  I grew up in Paradise Valley, and I have been eating there for over twenty years.  I have always enjoyed the food as I did tonight.  Most every item on the menu is delicious.  I probably have eaten there over 50 times, but tonight may be the last time that I will eat at El Chorro.  One of the main reasons that I enjoy this restaurant is for the sticky buns.  They are the best.  Tonight, while orderings our meals, I told the waiter how much I enjoy the sticky buns and to be sure to keep my basket of them replenished throughout the meal.  He unfortunately told me that now the restaurant only gives each customer one sticky bun with dinner and if I wanted any more of them I would have to pay an additional $12.00 for a small basket of 6 buns.  I almost walked out of the restaurant after hearing that.  The sticky buns and El Chorro are a Paradise Valley landmark for so many years.  Unbelievable.  We did order dinner, with additional sticky buns and some wine.  Our bill before tip was $120.00.  I gave the waiter a generous tip as well.  I just don't understand this absurd policy change in regards to limiting the sticky buns at this restaurant.  When two people spend $150.00 for and excellent meal, why does the management charge extra for a few small sticky buns, when they never did in the past?  I understand this is a new policy that was started one year ago.  I doubt that I or any of my family and friends will be returning to eat at El Chorro in the future.

After fifteen minutes of being ignored we left and escaped with our dignity and stomach lining intact.  Go to Arcadia!",

When I told the waiter that the fish was mushy, he told me that the fish was flown in daily and did not offer to get the manager involved.

    "text": "Last night I went to the new El Chorro. It's nothing like the old El Chorro and it pulled on my heart strings to tour the beautiful, yet unrecognizable, restaurant. Nothing stays the same and I love change, but not when it involves my valley institutions. Soon nothing in my life will resemble my childhood and I will have no attachment to this town. When Avanti goes, that will for sure be the end. Ok, I'm done whining. Hey, I wasn't the only one. I noticed plenty of others reminiscing... they did happen to be my grandparents age, but I guess that just means I'm wise beyond my years. Ha.    The new El Chorro is incredible and if you knew nothing of the Old El Chorro, you'll like it that much more. It was a last minute idea to swing by for dinner and the place was packed. So packed that we couldn't get a table. I've never been without a reservation and I figured a weekday was a good time to try... think again. Luckily, the bartender (where the old bar used to be) told us not to worry because she wasn't going to turn customers away. She obviously wasn't working there the time my uncle threatened to burn down an umbrella because it was blocking the view... he did tip $100 to the guy for moving it, though. His personality allows him to say things like that without causing anyone to feel alarm... or maybe it was the $100? Anyway, El Chorro lacks nothing in the customer service department.  So we sat, my mother, her ex and me. An odd group of three. He is totally still in love with her, so I encourage these little gatherings. Between the three of us, we ordered the filet, trout, and escolar. All delicious, but I am still saddened by the menu change. No beloved eggs benedict (that was served all day). No chicken livers. No jumbo shrimp (even though it's on their menu). The only thing retained- the sticky buns. Thank God for that.    Highlight of the meal was when the bartender made some after dinner shots when he overheard us discussing dessert. I asked him, \"what are these babies called?\" He responded, \"wet dream.\"  Great, I was having a shot called a wet dream with my mom and her ex. Not awkward at all. Actually, it was pretty funny and the shots were deliciously cinnamony.     El Chorro, I still love you. You're like a relative who got a facelift and although I no longer recognize you, you're still the same inside.",

I don't get the buns on the poor hostesses. They all look like a bunch of Stepford wives.

    "text": "I have lived in AZ for over 25 years and had heard this was a nice place to go. For our 27 Anniversary we decided to give it a try. We had planned to sit outside but the night we went it happened to be a very chilly night because of a recent system going through the state so we sat inside.   We had drinks- gin and tonics. I had the house gin and my husband had the tanqueray. Mine tasted very chemical-ly. Noticeably different than my husbands. So I got the El Chorro Bloody Mary after that and it was good.   Then we tried some appetizers- I got the grilled cheeses- very greasy. I didn't realize (nor do they tell you in the menu) that every piece has a different cheese inside. I am not a fan of blue cheese and of course that was the first one I ate. It was gross. And also the last one I ate.  My husband had the sausage plate and he enjoyed it.   For dinner I had the special- prime rib. I asked for the end cut hoping it would not be crawling rare. Nope. It was. It was a huge piece of meat and I took most of it home, cooked it a little more, and then sliced it and added it to a salad. The twice baked potato and veggies that came with my meal were cold. Nothing fries me more than paying $200 for a meal and it being cold. Sigh. My husband had the pork tenderloin . He liked it. It came with a pile of carrots and broccolini. Niether of which he ate, and some kind of orzo which was ok.   Then we tried dessert- he wanted to try the home churned ice cream. He liked it. I got the gooey caramel butter cake. It had some ice cream on top. It was ok.  I guess I was expecting to be blown away and wasn't. It was just ok. I probably would not go back and would not recommend anyone else go. For the price it just didn't wasn't over the top. Our server was ok. They couldn't manage to get the Dbacks on the big screen that was near us. Hmmm. Why? And something else kind of weirded me out. The hostess had a nice ruffley dress on- appropriate for this type of place yet she had flip flops on. Not nice ones, but kind of too casual ratty ones. That didn't impress me either.",

    "text": "We decided to go here for my birthday dinner since neither of us had been.  The patio seating was beautiful & it was a nice night, so that was a bonus.  Our waiter was very nice & our water glasses were consistantly kept full.  Another bonus was the gluten free menu. We ordered the artisan cheese & charcutrie plate to start & it was very good.  We decided to split the tomato & burrata salad, which was wonderful despite the stems being left on the tomatos, seriously, who does that?!?! I'm not able to have anything with gluten, so I was not able to try the sticky buns, but I'm told by my mother-in-law that they were heaven (we took them home to her). My husband ordered the Rocky Mountain Rack of Lamb and said it was good. Now, for the bad part...I ordered the 6oz Center Cut Filet with a baked potato & I was VERY disappointed to say the least.  My steak had a very odd, almost rancid taste & it was terribly dry.  My grandfather was a cattle rancher so I know good beef & I hold very high standards for beef & this fell very short.  My baked potato had absolutly no flavor whatsoever, even after drowning it in butter & salt (I'm quite sure my blood pressure jumped a few numbers & my arteries closed a little because of this). I was given a free White Chocolate Mousse Cake for my birthday which we could barely eat because it was SO sweet.  I wasn't able to eat the oreo cookie crust, but my husband tried it & said it did help with the extra sweetness a tiny bit.  I do appreciate the thought though. The patio seating, appetizer & the salad made up for the rest of the meal, but I can honestly say that I would not return here unless it was for drinks on the patio.",

    "text": "So much history in this place! When the long-time owner was retiring several years ago, it looked like the place was going to close. A local Paradise Valley resident stepped up to the plate, bought the place, did some reno, and the place is once again a local favorite, and a hit with tourists, too. The view from the bar or outside seating area can't be beat. Ambience inside is nice. Expect an older clientele. It is in ritzy PV, so don't expect low prices. I've only had dinner here once shortly after it re-opened, and it was for a group event. I thought the food was mediocre but maybe they've since worked out kitchen issues.  Anybody who has been to El Chorro raves about the sticky buns. Personally, I don't think they are that great. I've had them a couple of times, and they were just okay - dry and not overly flavorful. They certainly didn't live up to the high expectations. I'm probably the only one that feels that way!!  Been here a number of times for happy hour, which is pretty decent (Mon-Sat 4-6pm) - complimentary sliders, fruit and a variety of hors d'ouevres.  The happy hour menu also has a nice variety of small plates, but you aren't going to find potato skins or fried mozzarella sticks here - this place is high-brow. The grilled sausage trio is good as are the street tacos. The El Chorro margaritas are sooo good; my friend always tries one of the seasonal specialty cocktails and has never been disappointed.",

The sticky buns were not out of this world either. The guest we went with enjoyed their meal, that is why I gave 3 stars. If you want the best steak....Ruths Chris rarely makes a mistake cooking  it right....",
