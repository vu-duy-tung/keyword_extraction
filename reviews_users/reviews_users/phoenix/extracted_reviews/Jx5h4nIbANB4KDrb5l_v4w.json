The place has one other guest so busy really doesn't qualify as an excuse for your delay. Our checks took over 20 minutes to get, one guy had to ask 3 times for his beer. On top of that, they put 12 customers on our receipt so that our group of 6 was charged gratuity (probably good because our waitress did not deserve a tip). I'm extra pissed because your staff failed to clean up the stickiness on and under my seat, and my shoes now are permanently sticky. Don't know that we will be back.",

The decor in this place is a bit of an eyesore. There is a bar, some tables and booths, a pool area, what looks like stage for live music or karaoke. Very dimly lit and dirty/grungy feeling.   Our waitress was very odd as well. Not very friendly and didn't seem to have any knowledge of the menu. When asking questions about it she didn't really have an answer. The food is not very good and is an odd mix of Vietnamese, and American Chinese. Every thing the pit group ordered was just bland and lacked any creativity.  Probably won't be coming back...",

We then received menus and ordered our food and drinks. We got a sake bomber which was cold sake served in a dirty glass. The glass was dirty so we showed it to the bartender and she gave us a new one which was still cold. We have never been served cold sake before so we weren't really sure what was up with that. We then got our food. The six dollar spring rolls were definitely not worth it. Just lettuce with a STOP of pork wrapped in rice paper. The pho was actually really good! We are our food the bartender was noticeably over whelmed forgetting my drink order but brought it right when I reminded her. Then we get the check. Keep in mind it was happy hour. Never have I been charged separately for beer and sake. 8 dollars all together. And my little 8 ounce mixed drink was nine dollars. When I showed her these were not happy hour prices she said they didn't have happy hour on weekends. It was Thursday. She then told us it was happy hour prices. Um 9 dollars a drink for happy hour?!? Needless to say I was not happy with my experience here and will not be coming back. Yes the pho was good, but pho than is better with better service. I would not waste your time here I felt like I was on AND episode of bar rescue.",

They never answer their phone for takeout, finally they did months later and I was able to place an order. I got the vegetarian curry for 9.99 and it came with a total of three pieces of tofu, three pieces of potato, and three carrots. Other people weren't joking around about how badly they skimp on the food. The potato and carrot tasted very mushy and soggy, almost like it was super old and from some leftover stew or something and had been sitting out all day.       Overall the curry was very bad and probably the worst I've had in the area, for the same price I can get a real curry down the street. The garlic noodles were very stale/dry and stuck together and smelled like mushrooms too. I asked for thai tea and they said there wasn't any ready. So what, you can't brew more? I'm thankful I don't eat meat either, because a lot of people report getting food poisoning from here. I won't be eating here again, it's disgusting and they're clearly so greedy they can't spare more than three pieces of tofu for a basic vegetarian dish. I did not go in myself, but the person who did said it looked like a filthy dive bar and smelled really musty.",

Besides the pho, the also have some fantastic rice dishes.  The Shaken Beef (Bo Luc Lac) is incredible; chopped cubes of filet mignon cooked with onions and peppers.  The sliced BBQ Pork and Grilled Shrimp plate is excellent as well.  I'd also recommend saving some room for dessert and get the Coconut ice cream, which they serve in a fresh coconut with a chilled glass of the Coconut milk on the side.  If you'd like a new Vietnamese restaurant, look no further .",

They were still working on some construction inside but totally let me order Beef Pho (which I highly recommend)  They could have told me they were closed and to piss off but they were awesome!  Flavor was delicious and will be going back very soon... probably tonight because now i'm craving it.   I am giving this 3 stars because its a little confusing where the front door is and the inside could use some work.  Definitely need to change the lighting and the layout.  It looks like they put tables around randomly, just looks a little more of a dive bar than vietnamese - but I go for the food.  Keeping the 3 star rating but totally bummed with my last experience. I love getting take out from here and placed an order Sunday for dinner and went to pick it up and they didn't have my order and were less than helpful or apologetic. They just kept asking if I was Stan ... Do I look like a Stan?  Update: Came here for dinner and they had their live music - OMG THIS WAS AWFUL.  They had the volume on the absolute highest volume and the people who were signing were actually awful and painful to listen to.  I could not have a conversation or even think.  I do like their broth and think they give a good portion of meat compared to a lot of other places but I will only ever get take out - DO NOT EAT INSIDE unless you want your ears to bleed.",

Food: Definitely overpriced and extremely small portions. First I ordered my absolute favorite meal: bun bo hue large ($10) and it was just OK. It is supposed to be spicy and filled with meat but this thing had a few meatballs and beef. It was a huge disappointment.  So still starving, decided to order Cao's Special Fried Rice ($12) because it's supposedly large. It came out dry AF and flavorless, and again very small quantity. It was probably a left over honestly. I really wanted to complain but didn't want to wait for another dish because I was already there alone for about 45 minutes and didn't want to cause trouble.   Atmosphere: Outdated  Conclusion: Mind you, I am a 160lb dude who goes out to eat all the time at Vietnamese/Asian restaurants. I'm new to the area so I'm not sure if they're the only ones in town. If they are, I'm going to be sad not being able to get Viet food for a while.",

I got a chance to sing my song and my friends we right behind me on the list but for some reason they didn't get to sing after me.. So I was confused.. I believe the DJ for the karaoke puts up people he know and regulars first before us.. Which is a totally unfair and bias.

Serving sizes are generous, prices are decent, and the food is amazing.  Surf and turf pho is our favorite! I did dock a star because it's very dive-y.  They have fairly loud local acts and open mic nights and it's very dark in there for dinner.  If you can deal with that, though (which I recommend), the food is spectacular and service is above average.",

This place was almost $9 per sandwich and it was Chinese food meat converted to a Banh Mi use. Almost  every Vietnamese restaurant from here to Albany NY uses fresh French rolls that have a slight crust letting you know FRESH and good this was rather small and tough like delivered every 3-4 days it's a Portuguese roll not real French bread roll that has becomes fusion staple the Pickled radishes and cuts oversized just a real poor copy at a high price. The Pho looked good at each customer table but ordered something else as I was traveling and needed something road worthy I didn't get Vietnamese or Thai I got bad Chinese. Sorry maybe if you've never had good Vietnamese or Thai you'll like it but this was imitation crab on king crab tab. Try the place on Bell and 42 ave roughly always crowded and they most expensive item on menu is $11.99 and Banh Mi are $5 and bread is fresh everyday it's delicious. When it's packed from lunch to 9 pm with Asian diners you've got a good product.",

    "text": "I've had this place bookmarked for awhile, but it took a coworker's ravings for the pho here for me to finally drop in and see what it's all about.  (He told me that the owners are coworkers from another department.)  I read a couple of yelp friends' reviews, and I agree with Kay T.'s opinion that the restaurant is a dive bar.  Upon entering the place, I was disappointed to see that it really was a dive bar, but I wasn't surprised to find the atmosphere as it is, since another coworker's attempt at owning a bar (this was ten years ago) had the same atmosphere.  It's just a place where people can go after work, still in their black undershirts and black pants, and get a buzz on, or get wasted.  Thankfully, the steak pho I tried here was delicious!  $7.50 for the regular-size bowl, plus add $2.50 for tendon option.  I could even order veggies (bok choy, broccoli, carrot, and something else; important thing is that one may ask for any of these ingredients omitted-- great for those with food allergies!) for an extra $2.  For drink options, the Thai iced tea was too pricey ($4, and the restaurant didn't have any to sell), and an order of Vietnamese coffee was $5 (!!).  So far, this dive served food and Asian beverages sounded a little pricey for a place I hadn't tried, yet, so I just went with pho and added tendons.  The side dish of sprouts, sprigs of cilantro and mint, and lime arrived first, and seeing how small it was, I knew that the bowl with also be smaller than I'm used to.  And it was, but oh, so tasty!  The slices of steak was tender; a nice amount of tendon cuts added more textures; and a good amount of egg noodles.  I must preface that I'd skipped the second \"meal\" I'd normally have at work in order to have room for this pho meal, so perhaps I was so hungry, anything would taste great.  All I can report is that this is the very first bowl of pho where I ate everything- steak pieces, all of the sprouts on that side dish, egg noodles, AND tendon pieces!  The only thing left was a bit of soup.  Had that soup not been so salty, I probably would've consumed half of what was eventually left over...  Afterwards, I did feel that the soup had a LOT of sodium in it, and my face felt swollen, so I think the broth may even have MSG in it, and if Pho Cao uses MSG, I won't be able to return for a second tasting.  Based on that first bowl of pho, I would like to take my mom here, since she also enjoys a great bowl of pho.  (We'll just split a large order.)  She's a lot tougher a judge than me, though, since she knows how much it costs to make a broth meal (food shopping, costs, and preparation time).  I just know that upon seeing and feeling the ambiance of the place, she will ask me to take her somewhere else-- I don't blame her, I almost left without dining here myself!  If I'm right about the MSG, I won't have a reason to return.  The female bartender that served me was friendly, and the male server that handled the one table I saw occupied was, as well.  Happy hour is served from 3p to 6p.  I didn't ask if there was reverse happy hour.  Given the area, though, I wouldn't want to be there that late in the evening.",

When we walked in, it was straight up a bar atmosphere with a stage for live music.  It was dark, dingy and I don't know why we didn't just turn around and walk back out, but alas my son was hungry so we stayed and hoped for the best.  There was 1 server and about 3 tables that had patrons.  Our server tried his best, but it was so lackluster.  He never checked on us and we repeatedly had to ask for stuff.  Oh...and what's the point of memorizing what we order when you have to come back 2 times to ask us again what it was we ordered, and then a 3rd and 4th time for us to remind you that you've forgotten to bring us what we ordered.  The pho was terrible.  Three of us ordered it and my husband took a sip of the broth and pushed it aside and couldn't bare to eat any more of it.  My older son ate half because like I said, he was hungry, and my youngest just ate the noodles.  The spring rolls had no meat or shrimp but was completely overstuffed with shredded lettuce.  Ugh. I was so disappointed with this place.  We ended up leaving hungry because we couldn't finish our meals.",

If you're looking for a quiet atmosphere, I'd recommend checking to see if they have live music that night. We went on a Sunday evening, and it was not ideal for conversation.   The food: The pho is awesome! If you're a vegan/vegetarian they have great options (including vegan broth), and the veggie pho has great flavor. The other pho variants were liked in the group as well. If you're a bloody Mary fan, they put a Vietnamese twist on it, and I highly recommend it. If you're looking for a pho place, look no further.   The service: In general the wait staff was pleasant, polite and eager to help. It seemed as though they were understaffed, but the servers were all accommodating and apologetic for the delays. Hopefully it was just an issue of being down a server.  In summary, great pho, hipster vibe (may not be great for conversation depending on the evening), service was ok.",

I read other reviews ahead of time saying this but took the chance since the first Pho option we wanted was closed.   When we walked in a server/hostess told us to sit anywhere we'd like. Every booth seemed to have an empty glass or finished plate (about 3 or 4 empty booths like this) besides those currently occupied. We opted for a two person table instead. One of our chairs was sticky and so was the menu.   The food itself was ok. I judge Pho by the chicken, this chicken seemed liked it was canned and not fresh. They do serve coconuts though, if you are thirsty or Jasmine tea. That is if you don't want alcohol from the bar. I ordered tea, but I didn't realize they planned on bringing it cold when I prefer hot. Though, I wasn't asked a preference either way.   I would eat here again, it's just not my first choice for Pho.",

Came here with the idea of having Vietnamese food, but I think I made a huge mistake! Its dark, dingy, and there's a speaker directly above the table blaring reggae at me (the server said she'd turn it down, but hasn't happened yet...).  Mkay.  My first reaction is to run for the door. (I should have!) We split an order of spring rolls as an appetizer, well more of a side dish since it came out with everything else.  Very disappointing at $6-- mostly brown lettuce inside.  I could only choke down half of one, and no one was interested in the other half.  Oh, I seriously should have gone! I ordered the combo fried rice ($12) because it was the most reasonably priced entree and I felt it wouldn't make me sick.  The rest of the menu was too outrageously over priced for me to consider ($15 for stir fried beef w/onions and bell peppers? $13 for sort of pork chop and rice? Really?!). Again, I should have just said no.  It was ok, but I was not about to touch those three partially deveined, partially shelled, rubbery shrimp! Ew! The tv dinner pea/carrot mix is kind of expected (but usually at a much lower price point!). The quantity was sufficient, but that may have had more to do with my loss of appetite than anything else.   Top it off with $2.75 for a glass of diet coke, and you can call me less than thrilled about my experience here today. I've said before, I don't mind paying a little more for quality.  When I'm charged quality prices and you don't deliver, I get pissed.  This was $35 for a pretty bad lunch.  I work hard for my money and I don't like wasting it. So unless you're going in as the mole for \"Bar Rescue\"-- take my advice and run.  Run for the door and get in your car! Don't look back! Just go.",

    "text": "I was driving one day and noticed that Pho Cao is now in the neighborhood. Being constantly on the lookout for something new, I went in for lunch. Service was friendly, I was seated immediately, and I spent some time studying the menu.  I really wanted to like this place...  The restaurant itself is sort of dark and heavy with the dark walls and dark unfinished floor, and there is nothing to diminish the noise that reverberates off the walls and floor. I knew that if I returned here, it wouldn't be for the setting.  The server did check with me several times before I was ready to order, but I was glad he was paying attention. I decided on E17, Charbroiled pork and eggroll with vermicelli. The dish was very bland, and I found myself trying to flavor it up with Hoisin and Soy Sauce. That didn't work very well, so when I finally got someone's attention, I paid, and left most of my food behind. All though they weren't very busy, no one seemed concerned enough to ask me how my food was.   I decided a few days later to give it another try, that perhaps I should have guessed E17 would be bland. I wanted to like this place.   I entered, and was struck once again by the lack of atmosphere of any sort. it just feels like a big dive. This time I ordered two things to be fair, and I stuck with items I had read good things about in their ratings. I ordered the A5 Fried Chicken Pot stickers, and the P2 Steak Pho and sat back ready to have a better meal than on my previous visit.   The Pot Stickers were a generous portion, but the filling didn't offer up much flavor, and the dipping sauce just came off flat, not really enhancing the fried dumpling, the outside of which was hard rather than crisp. The Pho also didn't yield much flavor, even with all of the fresh ingredients added.  The portions were generous, but without any richness of flavor, I just got tired of eating and requested my check. I'll note that just as on my first visit, no one ever checked back after delivering my food to me to see if it was to my liking.  A further challenge on my second visit was that a young family of about 8 came in with their small child. In addition to the loudness of their voices in the room with nothing to break the sound, the squalling child, who they made no attempt to placate or entertain, completed my experience of - no, I don't need to try this again.  Maybe I'm getting it all backwards, and being open for lunch is done on a whim, and they really want to be a loud, fun evening entertainment venue that happens to have food. The concept may have alluded me. I'm sorry I couldn't like it.   The food wasn't horrible. Everything was very fresh. It just wasn't that tasty.  Also, at no point during either visit did I smell any food cooking.",

Came here to write a review and was completely baffled by some of the other extremely poor reviews...  I will say that I know that this restaurant just recently moved from another location, and I have to wonder if the chaos that that sort of event can create in a business was responsible for some of the other reviewers' poor experiences?  The decor is a bit strange, I will give it that. It's a bit pool hall, a bit dive bar, a bit karaoke bar... Not really a place that, just LOOKING at it, you would think would have great food.  I went in with a friend (fellow foodie) who'd been and was a fan. We grabbed seats at the bar and were immediately served by Victor, the owner.  Victor is funny and personable, and clearly has a quirky personality. After meeting and speaking with him, I think the atmosphere is really just a reflection of who he is. He is quick to laugh, loves karaoke, and is passionate about creating quality food (we had a 5 minute discussion about his selection of high-quality rice, preparation methods for it, etc.).  MY experience was probably the tastiest Vietnamese food I have ever had. I will definitely be a repeat customer and can't wait to try more of the menu.  Last night I had the Spicy Spring Rolls (BBQ pork, rice paper wrapper, Sriracha & Peanut sauce), Tom Chien Gion (Fire-Cracker Shrimp - coconut-crusted, deep fried shrimp with sweet & sour sauce), and Com Bo Luc Lac (Shaken Beef). Everything was perfection. And the beef was juicy, tender and flavorful.  Service was impeccable...  If you love good food, and a venue with a personality, do NOT skip this place due to a few bad reviews. If you're worried, find Victor. He will be sure to take care of you.",

    "text": "Up and running!  PHO CAO opened up this week in my neighborhood, I was hoping someone would take over the former Longshots and do something cool with it. Well some one did take it over and transplanted a Vietnamese Rock and Roll nightclub/restaurant.   If you go, know this they haven't finished the place yet, at least I hope not. A severe lack of attention to detail persist through out this cavernous space.  Here are several observations on this Transplant in my hood.  1 I was hoping for better 2 Clean this place up, they need to hire a girl that likes to clean. All dudes on staff. 3 lighting is horrendous I hope they take a strong look at that and make some changes  4 Do something with that bar, your liquor looks old and very disorganized, It's massively inefficient. 5 I hope the food improves my dish was just ok, I have heard great things just haven't tasted them yet. btw my order was incorrect but after we established the waiter misunderstood me and it wasn't made for someone else I insisted I keep it. 6 They need some bike racks lots of them, and light them up, Trust me on this. 7 I hope the smokers find a better place to smoke then just outside the front door. 8 This place actually needs a front door! The tiny black dirty metal door is not welcoming at all. They should drop a few bucks there for sure. in the interim put a plant, a porch light, and a rug there so customers don't have to guess how to enter. If it weren't for the smokers It would have taken more effort to find it. 9 Get a real website if they had a contact us, this would have been sent in private.  Positives 1 Live Music 2 Take out and delivery 3 Late Night Hours 4 Service was pretty good 5 This place has potential if the owners don't rest on past reputation and pay attention to details. 6 Great location on McDowell and 74th st. When the apartments are finished this place will be jumping.  I will return because I know it will be better then it was.",

The good: the pho and the goi cuon (spring and \"summer\" rolls) are pretty legit. Despite the higher prices (what do you expect in Scottsdale), the flavor is on point. The service is fast and I like that there is an option to have beer with my Vietnamese food (because Heineken makes the experience, people).  The meh: Weekend nights are strange here. We showed up at around 8 or so. There were 3-4 different cover bands singing karaoke-grade covers, and all 55+ as far as age. That's not a bad thing, it just wasn't the scene I was hoping for. It was, however, really obvious they need a sound guy. The feedback on the speakers was miserable and ongoing. Not pleasant for a dining experience.   I would like to go back again (and this is 100x better than Noodles Ranch up the street) but I'll try again on karaoke night to see how the vibe is.",

    "text": "I drove by Pho this week & couldn't wait to try it!  Came back tonight for Sunday dinner around 6pm.  There was live music and a seat yourself atmosphere.  The inside surprised me, because it's basically an old dive bar.   We searched for a booth, but they were mostly dirty.  I noticed a girl slowly attempting to clear tables. Like 1 cup at a time.  Once we sat at a booth for 8, the only option for our family of 3, she stopped cleaning the other booths.  The menu was extensive with lots of Asian cuisine, random American food of fries & wings, and of course Pho.  The food & service was pretty quick. The food was warm and tasty.   As we sat and ate, it was odd to me, as an ex-waitress, how short staffed the place seemed and how long tables stayed dirty.  I watched a waiter walk up to a dirty table next to us and clear off 1 fork. Only. Then shake his head at the rest.  Our waitress was nice, but literally ran around and shouted responses to customers, \"seat your self\" \"Walk up to the bar\"  And looked pained when I asked for an extra plate for my son.  It was the kind of service that wasn't terrible, but didn't leave room for 5 stars, because they were running around crazy.  The music, at 6pm dinner, was also kind of terrible. Filled with swearing & bad Croning.  While the food was pretty decent, the dark atmosphere, random music and hardly cleanly spaces make me think I most likely won't be back.",

I was told by a worker there that they cook the broth for 24 hours. I tried the beef and the chicken, both were equally tasty. The portion is large. One soup makes two full meals for me. Very fair prices too.    The staff was very welcoming and friendly when I went, which is the main reason why I keep going back.  The restaurant does look like a dive bar for sure which I was not expecting when I walked in, but its still a nice local place to eat.    Tip- they have karaoke if your into that",

One female bartender on and not one server in site. 3 tables and approximately 5 guests at the bar. Second time we had a male server with long curly hair serve us and was very sweet and attentive! Food was awesome! Third time, a tall male server greeted us with the phrase \"are waters good?\" before we even sat down. No suggestive selling or basic welcome in intro, felt awkward and not personal. Never got refills or offered refills until we were completely finished. This place always feels under staffed and besides the one time, we consistently get spotty, subpar service . Sometimes they have a bartender sometimes it's one doing everything. Awesome food consistently! Always fresh and hot. Someone just needs to give the servers some training or hire people who are better at their jobs.",

    "text": "I've been coming here for several years now (since its previous location on Scottadale road), and find the pho quality acceptable for the most part, and love the atmosphere and service.  So maybe 3 stars for pho itself and 4 stars for the service/atmosphere?  Problem is that I find the combination of the two features (pho and live music) a little dissonant.  Traditionally, pho is a breakfast meal and the broth can take all night to cook, eaten during a sliver of peaceful time you can find in the day.  Pho served here is indeed that-- big broth bowls for roughly $8/$11 for regular/large bowls. Quality is a little lower than other pho but is otherwise as traditional as any pho place you'd find in the US. The type of music/karaoke that's done at Pho Cao, on the other hand, is the opposite of that (despite some good acoustic musicians here!).  I think it's awesome that the venue is trying to trendset the two, but honestly the pho quality doesn't support it.  The servers seem to work pretty hard but it's just not the same pho quality because of the interference with bar/drink duties on top of food. If at all, I'd be willing to pay more for higher quality pho (and served differently than a traditional large bowl style) as that would jive better.",

The Pho was really flavorful and served with all of the add-ins (jalapeno, cilantro, sprouts, etc.). I want to come here for dinner and drinks before a night out on a Friday.

The noddles were slightly over cooked.  We also had the soft spring rolls and the spicy wings.  The wings were not crispy and cook just poured buffalo sauce over wings on plate creating a soup rather than tossing them playing.  Spring rolls were delicious.   Service was fine.

We were informed that wasn't possible.  We asked about the vegan broth, but were informed that everything goes all in the same wok so cross contamination was going to happen.   You even advertised that if you had a food allergy to let the wait staff know and they will accommodate your needs. This didn't happen and we had no other option but to leave and go some place else.   Frankly I'm just straight up perplexed and disgusted at the casual disregard for people with any type of food allergy.",

Open mic on Sunday evenings!    I sat at the bar alone and at first Pho Cao somewhat still confuses me; Vietnamese Pho restaurant at a dive bar?  I guess it works in a sense, but I was just trying to watch the game and didn't care much for the performance.  I ordered a Export 33 to start and just a bowl of regular Pho.  They have ramen Pho, but I wasn't sure if I should go for it since I didn't feel to adventurous that night.  Overall, the Pho is pretty good.  Broth came nice and piping hot they way I like it!  I think the side sprouts, basil, and jalapeno could be at tad bit fresher, but maybe it's out of season.    In the end, Pho Cao definitely caters to a new crowd that enjoys their Pho with a beer and live music.  You probably won't see many traditional Pho lovers here, but that doesn't matter.  I would like to point out I do appreciate good service here.  My bartender was busting her butt; as a former waiter, I totally understand that work life and appreciate what it has made me become.  Kudos to the bartender! - Enjoy!",

We don't know a lot about Vietnamese cuisine but have eaten it before at a couple other places over the years, including a food truck operation that offered up pho and other vietnamese foods; my husband had the pho with chicken and they bring you the broth and the add ins separately so you can add what you want ....since they do include Jalapenos, nice to be able to add what you prefer to spice it to your liking; I had the pineapple rice with chicken and shrimp which was served in a half of a pineapple, was wonderful and attractively presented.  Portions are very ample, hubby did devour every drop of his soup and I brought enough leftovers home for both of us tomorrow  :) While eating we enjoyed some awesome blues.... I understand this band is there regularly..... great service, the staff was wonderful, it's a fun place to people watch and we look forward to coming back often....",

And claimed to have all these ingredients and all it came with was lettuce and salmon. No avocado, nothing. My pho was fine. But online it was supposed to be 9.50 with all my add ins and it came out to 17.50. Complete ripoff. And my boyfriend got an entree with steak and shrimp. Tiny portion of steak and three tiny shrimp. 12 dollars. Sooooo ridiculous. Never going back. Otherwise the restaurant itself looks cool inside but would not recommend eating there if you want to get what you pay for BC you pay a lot and get nothing.",

Very refreshing to not be in your typical Scottsdale franchise.  I ordered at the bar, the bartender was friendly and very helpful. As I waited for my food I observed a mixed crowd. Family with a baby, college students ,older women chatting with me at the bar, while the band was warming up. It was very clean and comfortable. I ordered Salmon Spring Rolls  which was the only food item I didn't care for ,everything else was really good. I also had the pineapple fried rice which was served in  a pineapple! We also had the endamame Sauteed in garlic, chili and I think lemongrass . We also got spring rolls that were soo good and my husband got some fried rice dish with meat and he loved it! I'm so excited to have a great ethnic restaurant / bar in my neighborhood,  finally!",

I absolutely love quality PHO and both trips to Pho Cao have made me wish I had went to my usual spot on the west side. I live in Old Town so this spot is convenient, but not much more than that. Service is ALWAYS slow, and forgetful. I have visited the old spot by the freeway, and now the new spot off of McDowell and both places were dark, dank and dive-y. I can appreciate a good dive bar, and even hole-in-the-wall type places, but this place seems to miss the mark on both. The Pho broth tastes like ramen broth. It isnt clear like good, slow simmered pho both is supposed to be. Pho Cao's broth is brown and the noodles are always clumped together in a ball at the bottom of the bowl. The spring rolls are decent but the peanut sauce is def from a jar. Its overtly sweet and tastes more like a peanut butter paste than sauce. Like I said, its not horrible, its just not a genuine pho restaurant. This is a karaoke joint that services hipsters who want to think they are eating genuine pho. Service is slow, and food is mediocre. I doubt I will return.",

    "text": "Food was good as usual. I have been here many times and will be back. Salmon rolls were great and so was the fried rice with shrimp, bbq pork, and Chinese sausage, except there was only three shrimp, overcooked, with the tail on. I really don't enjoy having to dig into my dish to remove the tails and they were hard to cut with a fork being over done. My friend had shrimp fried rice with more shrimp in it and spent the first five minutes of his meal doing the work the kitchen should've done to be able to enjoy his meal. Also no knives served with it to cut them. But that's not why I only gave it three stars, but it was our server too. We usually get great service from two particular servers who I will not name, but this time we got someone else. He failed to offer us drinks, which we did want an alcoholic drink before the meal waiting for for our appitizers, but we were only offered water. On top of that our food came out in two dramatic shifts instead of being timed better, although that could be the server, the two dishes were the fried rice which hold well and he could have made the delivery better. I had to get my own napkins from the bar and take a condiment tray from another table because he failed to bring one or to do the two bite/two minute check on our table. No, it wasn't busy, it was karaoke night and later in the evening so most people weren't eating. One friend had to stop him to order his drink but it had to be refilled but had to stop another server for a refill. Will be back, he will not be our server.",

    "text": "My Steak and brisket pho had about 6-8 pieces of 1.5\"x3\" paper thin pieces of meat.  It tasted awful without adding soy sauce and chile pepper sauce.  Lots of rice noodles though.  The peas were few, and were dry and sriveled as though they'd been freezer burned and thrown into the hot broth frozen.  So essentially, I paid 7.40 for 40oz of liquid with rice noodles that had been associated with some beef.  And the liquid was foul tasting.  The spring rolls were perfect.  They were obviously made in a factory and shipped frozen then deep fried at the restaurant.  We went on Sunday Night- open mic night.  There were lots of musicians, and two of them were talented.  Had we not already ordered an appetizer we would've left without eating.  Then we missed our second chance when the wait person (very nice, but unbelievably forgetful) forgot our order.  When they (I am trying to keep the person anonymous) returned to be reminded of the entrees we wanted, they had someone else's credit card, and had forgotten to return it to him.  We both ordered pho.  It's feaux pho, if you ask me.  Behind us sat a group of young men who lacked the vocabulary, self-control and courtesy to refrain from dropping an F-bomb in every sentence.  My wife and I suffered through our awful meal with this profinty laden cacophany of lousy music and loud drunken talking.  There are lots of great Asian options nearby, this one is very cheap.  But for a little more you can get some hearty and delicious Vietnamese food.  If you like this place, go to Miss Saigon in Tucson next time you're down that way.  But be warned: If you do, you'll never want to return to Pho Cao.  Or go to Totties, which is at the SW corner of Hayden and Thomas (about 2 miles from this joint).  Both have more authentic (and far more enjoyable) food, Totties has the nicer atmosphere.  I'm sure I could name quite a few others.",

There was also hoison sauce, soy and sriracha on the table. I love sauces so I was in heaven! Jessica was our server and she was super nice, attentive and helpful with the menu. I got the chicken and veggies on egg noodles but....I added chinese sausage, which is my favorite!  It was really flavorful and there were a lot of veggies including bok choy, cabbage, onion, carrot etc...my main complaint was the music.

Come back, we order a beer and a white wine.  Waitress comes back with a room temperature glass of wine, I get a bottle, no glass to pour it in.  Waitress disappears, I go up to bar to get a glass, and the guy at the bar does a 90 degree turn away from me.  Eventually he comes back, I ask for a glass, and my dining partner asks for white wine that isn't warm.  OK, food time.  We both order Pho Ga', chicken pho.  My chicken is half cooked, and the pieces are all ligaments and muscle.  Waitress gives us our food, says she will be right back with napkins, but never comes.  After several minutes she comes by to ask how we are doing, I say \"uh, napkins\", and she runs to get them, drops them off on the table and blithely says \"no problem!\".  Well, there is a problem, when she comes back again, I show her undercooked chicken with all kinds of gristle and un-chewable bits on it.  She apologizes and offers to get me something else...well, if you can't cook chicken, then I don't want anything else.  I ask for the check and get another snotty \"no problem!\" response.  Well, there is a problem, bad food, bad service, dangerously under cooked chicken and a bathroom that smells like death.  No, I'm not going back, there are plenty of quality Pho restaurants out there that offer quality food and good service.  This place is a disaster.  Edited to add 5/26/16:  After posting this review, the manager, David Gump sent me a profanity laced email (he used the F word 4 times) and accused me of being cheap and trying to get a free meal...I NEVER asked for anything to be comped.  He also said that I was banned for life and that \"We have wars because of people like you.  You need to get back to school and get educated.\"  I'd post more of his email, but I do not wish to share the profanities that he sent to me.  His email to me really confirms that this is not a place I ever want to do business with again.  Please avoid this place and this unprofessional manager.",

The location has been empty for year and as a Pho aficionado, I was so supper excited to see this place opening in my neighborhood. I do understand that during my visit, they were still trying to work out some kinks, which is always to be expected of new restaurants. However, it was way unorganized. When I walked in you immediately see a large bar right in front of you (which is where all the employees seemed to be). There was no hostess in the hostess area, so I just went to the bar. I wanted to order food to go and let a server know this. I sat for 20 min before even getting a menu, waited another 10 min for someone to take my order, and another 20 min for my actual food. Meanwhile I sat at the bar while an employees complained loudly amongst themselves about all the work they had to do that day. I stayed because I hoped the food would make up for it all. The answer is, it did not. I  ordered House Pho, dumplings, egg rolls, and fried rice. All the non soup items were very greasy and lacked seasoning. The pho too was under seasoned and my noodles were gummy.  I might give this place another shot an a few more months and a few more reviews to allow them some time to get things going.",

Went about 11am, going from the bright outside to super dark inside it took like 5 minutes for my eyes to full adjust to be able to see anything! Ordered our food... 2 spring roll appetizers and 2 bowls of pho, papaya salad, and lemongrass chicken. In a normal Vietnamese restaurant your spring roll is out in about 5-10min max from ordering... Then your pho follows shortly after.... Not this place!! 20min later ONE spring roll, the nem nuong came out.... Highly disappointed.... Would not have known it was nem nuong if I didn't order it.... Another 25min later our pho comes out along with the other 2 dishes .... Pho was bland and flavorless.  It should NOT take 40-45min to get pho ..... When there was only 3 other tables in the restaurant..... PLUS  we didn't even get the other spring roll we ordered!!! Completely disappointed.... Went to the location when it used to be next to the 202.... Figured we'd tried it one more time.... Will never go back.. There are much better Vietnamese restaurant around.",

Arrived in time only to sit st the bar for an additional 30 minutes. I honestly believe that the food had not even been started until I arrived. I asked how long it would take and the bartender/ waitress told me she didn't know she that she told the owner. Ok?? Told the owner what exactly? I never found out. In her defense it seemed as if she was doing everything in her power to try and run the whole restaurant. In closing the place is a complete shitshow and completely disorganized. I blame the owners and management. It is completely evident that they do not value their carryout customers. If I owned a restaurant and people were kept waiting I would most certainly apologize, introduce myself and rectify the situation to their liking. The woman before me waiting for carryout also told me she was waiting forever. She did not seem happy. The food was surprisingly decent despite the fact it looks like the whole restaurant hasn't been properly cleaned in years. I would be scared to see what the kitchen looked like. I would not recommend this establishment. Stick to making drinks and karaoke. Would not recommend and highly doubt I will go here again.",

We ordered takeout and ordered a drink while waiting.  If you're searching for epic cocktails - forget it.  The wine is poured out of those little airport bottles (for freshness? ) but unlike the airlines it was only $4. That said, the locals, the service (Lucas was the perfect host, bartender, and server), and the food was awesome.  While we pondered the menu an enormous plated ice cream extravaganza was delivered to the couple next to us and it could've easily been served at a fine dining restaurant.   Once home, the Shaken Beef was divine with tender, abundant filet mignon/veggies in the most delicious sauce.  It honestly is the best pepper steak I've ever had.  My friend thoroughly enjoyed the Buddha Spring Rolls.  Even the chicken fried rice stood out with large chunks of perfectly cooked chicken and good flavor. There is easy parking, karaoke, cheap drinks, and again - Incredible food!",

It looks like maybe a dive bar or karaoke bar at night, but it was mid day so that vibe wasn't what we were looking for and the music was so loud we could hardly talk. Food wise, everything tasted great! The prices were nice too. I'm sure if we came here in the evening to drink my review would have a different feel. In summery, if you are nearby and just want some simple and delicious pho, this is your place. Or if you order to go, you'll be happy. But maybe don't go out of your way to come here if you are looking for a cute atmosphere. P.S. there's outdoor seating (we would have done this if it wasn't so cold that day...) and plenty of parking.",

Kind of smells like a stinky old bar.  Certainly not very appetizing.   I ordered the ramen noodle pho to try something different.  The pho comes with rare steak and brisket, ramen noodles, and a boiled egg.  The broth was pretty nice and the meat was fairly decent.  However, the cilantro and basil on the side looked as if it came out of the trash or the alley behind the restaurant.  Very poor quality, dry and wilted.  I would have liked to have tried the fresh spring rolls, but they were a little pricey.  They were double what I am used to paying at other Vietnamese places in the area.  Finally, there was a charge to use my credit card, which was not posted anywhere.  I had cash, but by the time I checked my receipt, it was too late to change it.",

I ordered the Surf and Turf pho, my s/o got the shaken beef, and my brother got the house fried rice. The pho was nothing special, though I did think it was cool that they gave me raw beef in a separate container from my soup (so it still cooked in my bowl at home). My s/o loved the shaken beef, and I also thought it was quite tasty. The house fried rice, on the other hand, was dry and the BBQ pork wasn't quite as fragrant as it usually is, so it was kind of a letdown.    Obviously, take-out isn't the best way of judging a restaurant's food quality, so keep that in mind. We weren't in there for very long, but we really dug the vibes and definitely want to go back to hang out and give the food a second chance.",

I also ordered a basket of sweet potato fries that came out hard and dark colored -nearly burnt. It just didn't satisfy me whatsoever. The decor inside is very confusing too- a vietnamese restaurant meets and american dive bar? Just didn't really make a whole lot of sense to me. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is my server, the man with the beard, was kind and attentive. Would not recommend if you are looking for quality pho!!",

    "text": "This place is very confused. It is a Vietnamese restaurant in a dirty dive bar setting, with a pool table and several flat screen TVs, and 60s music blasting in the background. My water was served in a faded Rebel IPA glass. The lighting was very odd and the place felt dark and sticky. There is also no way of looking into the restaurant from the outside, because the windows are covered and the doors have no windows.  Upon entering, a female server approached me and asked \"what's up?\"; when I told her I was dining in, she told me to sit anywhere. The male server I had appeared to be high and his speech was slurred and difficult to understand. There were only four other tables seated, but yet the two servers were literally running around the restaurant.  I ordered a pork chop combo (pork chop, rice, egg roll, fried egg, and chicken wings). The rice was wet and mushy and tasted like chlorine. The filling inside the egg roll tasted spoiled. Everything else was greasy and tasteless. I couldn't finish any part of my meal.  I ended up leaving and going to another restaurant down the block.",

When I told them it was awful they still wanted to charge me full price.  They only gave me a 10% discount.  That's poor business I won't recommend or every eat there again.",

We were able to order right away, but watched 4 tables come in, get seated and served their food before we got our pho. We waited for 40 minutes before we got flavorless pho that was only very warm. The noodles in mine were undercooked yet the veggies were overlooked. One of the people that came in ordered, ate and paid in about 30 minutes, while we couldn't even get our change from out bill after being there for 2 hours! I will never come here again and tell everyone I know to avoid this place because you're going to wait 5 times longer than other guests for the most tasteless pho of your life!",

A side door, hardly marketed and hard to see. Once inside we were greeted by a server who informed us we could sit wherever we liked. We chose a booth in the corner of the raised area. There was a karaoke dj and a few large groups obviously there for the karaoke. The atmosphere was dark and stale. I ordered spring rolls and a regular steak pho. The rolls were nothing but filler and a few shreds of pork and a shrimp or two. They literally stuck to the plate. The pho came and my disappointment grew as I discovered 4 or less pieces of actual meat and far too few noodles to even out the amount of broth. Overall a disappointment. Would have rated one star but our server was prompt and friendly.",

Yes! Since I don't eat beef, it's hard to find pho places that serve this yummy hot soup beef-less since its traditionally a beef based soup. And let me tell you this vegan broth was awesome! I ordered the seafood pho but with vegan broth and it was delicious, filled with mushrooms and carrots too! Yumm yum! A bit over- priced compared to other pho spots but worth it if you are a non-beef pho lover!",

    "text": "Yes, the place is a little odd, and from reading the reviews I can see where the place has a little bit of an identity crisis, but I thoroughly enjoyed my experience. Let me be clear though - I went to see a band, not for the pho, so take that into consideration as you read this review.   I got there about 30 minutes before the first band, and even though I went in through the wrong entrance (I went in through the door the bands load and unload) I got greeted and seated immediately. Service throughout the evening was just fine. I never had to wait around for anyone to show up with another drink, the guy was always around. Food was good. I've had better Vietnamese food in the valley, but have no complaints about the food served here.  I can understand someone coming specifically for Vietnamese fare and being put off by the divey sports-bar vibe at lunch time, or rolling in later at night to find a loud band up on stage, or drunk karaoke fans howling away. But for me, looking at it as a venue for live music, I think it was great. The place has a nice setup for live music and the bands sounded good. I got to sit at a table, get well taken care of by my waiter, eat decent pho, have some beers, and watch some great bands playing original music.   I'm definitely going back.",

There was a live band playing when we got in and then a half an hour later, another band played.  It was nice to see the restaurant support local artists.  I have to say, the second band was heavy metal and surprisingly pretty good!  It can get very loud so if you are here to just enjoy a meal in quiet then this place may not be for you.  Great spot and very out of the norm for a Pho restaurant but I totally dig it!",

The spring rolls are a must try.   They give you the option of adding tarragon to any pho; exercise this option with caution.  I suggest trying the original dishes before modifications.   This was my second consecutive Halloween at Pho Cao enjoying the live music.  The staff is friendly,  the beer is cold and the food is excellent (superior to PT Noodle).",

    "text": "I recently switched jobs and I was in desperate need of a new local Pho joint.  I found this place by checking yelp to see what was close and thought I would give it a try.  When I first walked in I was very confused.  It seemed like I was walking in to an empty nightclub or just a regular hole in the wall bar.  Had a strange vibe for what I thought was a Pho joint.  I got their basic sliced beef pho with an order of spring rolls and an order of Thai Tea. You could tell that a couple of the bartenders or servers might have been new, but the service was still pretty good.   The Pho came out and the broth had a strange taste to it.  I couldn't quite place it but it had this weird after taste.  I added my usual toppings into it and it tasted a little better.  However, a good Pho restaurant should have a great basic broth.  They brought out the spring rolls and the single soggy piece of lettuce that was brought out with it was extremely disappointing.  I had to ask for more lettuce and was brought one single piece again??    All in all, not so sure i'll be visiting this place again and my search for a good Pho place by my new work has eluded me.",

The second time, we stopped by here after having spent nearly all day at the Scottsdale Pavilions doing indoor skydiving and go-karting.  It was open mic night, and there were a few performers exhibiting their guitar prowess.   To be honest, this place is a dive. If we dined here with that mindset, we wouldn't have had such an issue with the Pho that we had ordered.  We often sample a new Pho place each month; therefore, we are pretty well versed as to what to expect as far as texture and flavor.   However, we became very concerned with the actual texture of what was being passed as beef. It didn't look like real beef. And it didn't taste like real beef. It actually had the appearance of a frozen beef packet that was summarily boiled.  And the Pho itself didn't have the tangy flavor that we were accustomed to.   Couple that with the lack of utensils, and our inability to actually get the attention of a server that wasn't distracted by the event. It didn't make for a good impression regarding our dine-in experience.  I did give this place two stars because the local talent they had were actually quite entertaining and provided some levity from our dissatisfaction with both the food and the service.",

There were lots of people coming in to pick up orders, but not so many staying to actually dine here.   We sat at the bar and it wasn't the best experience. The guy working was new and still trying to figure things out, no big deal. They were out of the two drinks I wanted, so no happy hour for me. The food was good, so I could definitely see why there were so many people coming in just to grab take out. I tried the charbroiled pork and eggroll over vermicelli. My date had the ramen noodle pho. I think my dish was better.   Our server handed us the check halfway through the meal and asked us at least five times if we were ready to settle up. I honestly felt rushed and would have understood if the place was crowded and they needed the seats. There were three of us at the bar with room for eight and plenty of empty tables.  I liked the food, so I may go back?",

    "text": "Is Pho Cao a dive? Is it a karaoke bar/club? Is it a Vietnamese restaurant with good food? Yes, yes and yes. I can see how there would be very mixed reviews of Pho Cao. We went for lunch, so there wasn't a band or any karaoke going on. If you went for dinner I can see how that might be annoying if you weren't expecting it. So go for lunch!  especially if you like quirky places.  Regardless, it is a little disorienting when you walk in from the bright sunlight to the darker windowless room and see the stage in front of you. It feels like an awesome place to drown your sorrows. While we didn't have any sorrows the day we were in, we did still have a beer and a cider.  Once we took a seat, the wait staff was great, and the food even better. We did not try the namesake pho, but had a rice noodle (bun) salad bowl, house fried rice and chicken curry. The rice noodle bowl was great. Chargrilled pork, shrimp and a crispy spring roll on lettuce, cucumber, carrots, herbs, and rice noodles with fish sauce- so good! The fried rice has chunks of that amazing dense Chinese sausage and an egg on top. It also came with two little chicken drumsticks that were nothing special. The chicken curry was just okay. A little too sweet, and tasted too much like the curry powder you buy at the grocery store. We'll definitely go back for the food. Not the karaoke. Believe me, no one wants to hear that! #tonedeaf 4 stars for food 3 for atmosphere",

Pho Cao artfully blends the flavors of a Vietnamese restaurant (let's be honest, most of the restaurants have relatively boring decor and set-ups) with the, shall we say, charm of a dive bar, and packs in a stage for live music and karaoke to boot. The place does this without sacrificing service, as every time I've been, the wait staff has been quick and attentive. The pho I had was GIGANTIC but didn't sacrifice flavor and I look forward to going back.",

It dumped down my leg. After that the refill was the same way. Asked about spring rolls said I don't eat pork. He recommended the first one with pork. Then repeated I don't eat pork recommended the only other one on there with pork in it so settled on the spider ones and made my own non pork decision. Brought out 2 entrees to the customers I was with. Mine never came out. Double checked what was going on assured it was on the way. My pho never came. Walked over to kitchen after long wait and asked him to box it to go with noodles separate and all components separate . Noodles in my broth and all the meat. Asked and paid for extra meat, got 2 extra prices of shrimp no extra meat. Majority of ingredients not on side so noodles Super soggy and gross by the time I got home to eat. Icing on the cake the bill was $68.50 I gave him $100 he brought me back 30$ while explaining and I quote \" I couldn't find another 1.50$ so here is 30 back sorry about that. I left no tip and will not return. Worst waiter and service ever. Worst to go ever.",

Enjoy your bad review and the $40 tab Pho Cao. If I could have given you negative stars and Worst Shithole of the Year, I would have...Avoid this shithole.",

I came with 3 tantalizing young women, who were promptly cat called by a cretin on the way in. Granted, they were all drop dead gorgeous, but they were not impressed. Upon entering this pathetic excuse for an establishment, we were distraught to see that 2 heathens were playing guitar and singing folk tunes on the restaurant's incredibly loud speakers. Imagine the worst voice you've ever heard in your life. Then imagine a worse voice than that one. We were subjected to the previously mentioned voice crooning horrific show tunes for well over half an hour. We had nowhere to run. Nowhere to hide. We were prisoners of this deplorable human and he got off to our anguish. If you see Pho Cao on the way home from work on a sleep Sunday afternoon, turn around. Drive. Drive fast. Drive until you reach the ocean. Then start swimming. If there is a hell, I've been there. It is Pho Cao.",

Thursday night is karaoke night. Fun times. Of course there are the few show offs, just like it is at any karaoke night.

    "text": "I moved so I haven't been there recently. I heard they recently moved too. I'm planning a trip out there soon because I miss their pho thai bowls, Banh mi sandwiches, and thai teas. Can't wait!  UPDATE: I went there on Friday 5/5/17 and had a very disappointing and negative experience. My roomate and I were in the area. So, we stopped by for an early dinner around 5pm. The place was completely empty. We walk in and sit ourselves in a booth. After a few minutes, a waitress comes out and comes by to our table to take our orders. We both order two Thai iced teas and some appetizers: fried calamari, and an order or spring rolls, which we shared. The calamari were very different than I'm used to at any other restaurant. But, not bad. The disappointing and strange part is that they were served with a side of shrimp cocktail sauce  (unoriginal). We were both starving at that point, so we both scarfed down the appetizers and waited for our dinner entrees. I ordered a bowl of Pho soup (regular size #6) and my roomate ordered a chicken curry dish.  I guess I should have paid attention that my pho was not steaming hot as it normally is served. But, like I said before, we were starving. Right after our dinner we both started to feel overly full. Which is somewhat normal after eating a bowl of pho. But the strange part is that after we got home, I noticed that my stomach felt upset even 4 hrs after. I took some Pepto to soothe my stomach upset. A little while later, I would spend the rest of the night and part of the next morning vomiting the entire contents of my stomach. Which was everything I had for dinner. I had a bad case of food poisoning!  I had not felt that sick and horrible after eating anywhere in years. As far as I can recall, I had only had food poisoning once before. And the symptoms were pretty similar. Either the cook or the kitchen is operating under unhealthy sanitary conditions, or the soup was not cooked to proper temperature to prevent someone from getting sick.  Either way,  I can no longer recommend this restaurant to anyone. Sad. Because I had been there several times before without incident.   BEWARE: If you have the pho soup here, make sure it's piping hot! And still, eat at your own risk. Sorry Victor. Maybe it is just the cook. Either way, heads up on checking that the kitchen is operating to proper food handling/preparation standards. I'm sorry I had to give you a bad review.  I just don't want anyone else getting as sick as I did.",

The menu is plentiful....plenty of asian cuisine, including Pho. But there's a pool table and a stage. And a musician performing an extensively long sound check. Once the band started, we ate as fast as we could not because the music was bad, but because it was too damn loud for us to hear each other talk! The service had much to be desired. Our server, very young, had no idea what several of the menu items were when we asked questions about them. But instead of offering to ask the cook, he just stood there with his hands in his pockets saying \"Um, you know, I really don't know what that is\".....well....GO FIND OUT! And I don't know if you've ever been the last to finish your food, but normally, the server leaves some plates. But instead of just letting us rest a bit, he was trying to take away our plates that still had food on them, and even while one of us was still eating, he asked if we wanted a to go box for her meal, and put the check out. At waffle house, sure...but we just expected a bit better.  My clay pot with crunchy rice was anything but crunchy. It was basically steamed rice, beneath a layer of steamed vegetables with some thick sweet sauce poured on top of it. Not tasty at all.  Anyway, we tried and we disliked.",

Additionally, I asked for Boba and, despite it not being on the menu, the kitchen prepared a cup. They didn't have the wide straws, but I was nevertheless impressed by their willingness to accommodate me.   The Pho itself is the reason I chose not to give five stars. It's flavor was above average: The broth was rich and robust. The noodles appear to have sat dry for a few minutes too many, as they were clumped together. I attribute it to the lack of a much rush, so it isn't a fatal flaw.   All in all, Pho Cao exceeded expectations for a nightclub-esque noodle shop. I'll be back for more Pho and the puns that came with it.",

    "text": "This pho is soooo delicious! The atmosphere is a little too grungy for me tho. The only reason it's getting three stars is because an hour for soup and 20 mins for a drink is a little too much. The waiter was panicked the entire time. Maybe more servers would make the experience better for everyone. GREAT food tho. Highly recommend for a snack or a first date. The server will definitely leave you alone.",

The reason I gave this place a 4 star is because the interior definitely needs an update. Looks like a dive bar and then some lol. Other then that food and service was on point!!   I most definitely will eat here again!",

BUT tonight i really wanted pho and we don't get out of work til 9 so i was excited to see when we checked their hours that they were open til 1030. We got there at about 925 and walked in and we're told they were actually closed. I said \"aren't you guys open til 1030?\" and she responded \"oh ya, we are closing up early tonight....\" We drove out of the way to go there and it was just really unprofessional.  If you have a set time that your establishment closes, how can you just decide to shut it down early if you have people coming in seeking service? At least lock the damn door then. Douche...",

Owner had excuses to give his staff, but wouldn't come out and speak with us.  We eat Pho weekly, in Seattle.  This was disgusting and an embarrassment to anything Pho. Even the waitress said she prefers eating Pho anywhere else.  I would never return or recommend this place to anyone!",

We came when they opened and they had some really good specials going on. We ordered their pho and it's really yummy. For a regular size is good enough for me. They have 2 bowl sizes. One is 40oz and 50oz. I felt full after an eggroll, potsticker, and pho. The egg rolls were really good but didn't like the sauce that much. Price wise wasn't bad but could be cheaper. Overall, I'll come again. Nice place!",

When I walked into the place I was surprised how plain it was and almost resembled a dive bar.  But then everything changed. Our server was very good with the menu and had several recommendations and was extremely helpful.  The food was very tasty and the pineapple fried rice was outstanding.    It will probably end up being one of my go to places because the price was right for outstanding food.. I'm not as concerned about the cheap bar decor. It was just a bit of an odd experience.",

We placed an order through Postmates for crispy rolls, 2 chicken phos and a side of rice, got charged around $33 for everything. We received our food and noticed they forgot 1 of the phos. Mind you this happens constantly at Pho Cao and we're always having to drive back for something they forgot. Anyway, we called to tell them they forgot 1 pho and like any business with good customer service they would acknowledge their mistake and try to fix the situation, that was the complete opposite here. The OWNER started getting very angry and arguing on the phone about how it's Postmates fault and we need to call them when clearly it wasn't, we then said we had no problem driving over to get the 1 pho they forgot and he just continued to argue with us and be rude. After about 10 minutes of the OWNER being extremely unprofessional and extremely rude we told him we will not be going to his establishment any longer and hung up. There are plenty of good places that serve great pho that don't have owners who are crooks.",

However, it felt cool and the employees were really friendly, my server also knew his menu well.   I ordered the Spider Crab Spring Roll (Goi Cuon Cua Lot), Fried Chicken Dumplings (Ha Cao Chien), and the Ramen Noodle Pho. The softshell crab was my favorite, felt really fresh and healthy. The ramen pho was also good, but nothing special. I was kinda disappointed over the dumplings, the consistency of the chicken was a bit bland and the overall dumpling was doughy. Finally, the price was kinda steep. Therefore I give the whole experience 3-stars.    Although the food wasn't great, I would come back to one of their nightly events. As I wrote previously, the staff were friendly and I felt the atmosphere was cool. They organize open mic nights, karaoke, and have live performances. So that's definetly something to check out!",

Every thing about the place reeked of Scottsdale dive-ness.   The dance floor is a tiny space that is cordoned off by some wood railings. The floor is the same dirty tile that covers the rest of the place.   When I arrived on a Saturday night the floor was a mosh pit of young lower class Scottsdale hipsters. It was body to body, standing room barely, and people were allowed to carry booze onto the floor. People were pressing through the tables in an attempt to crowd into the tiny mosh pit. No way I was even going to try to dance there!  I would give the place a 1 star but they do deserve credit for having a lot of live music.",
