    "text": "My first time back at Mimi's in five years, and probably my last. The service was great! Our waiter was very polite, and attentive. It was the food that was more than a little lackluster. My boyfriend ordered the smoked salmon omelette ($13.29) and I chose the quiche florentine ($9.29). When our food came I was disappointed to find that my \"fresh fruit\" side consisted of 2 orange crescents, half of a half moon of cantaloupe, and 2 slivers (emphasis on SLIVERS) of pineapple.  The Quiche was equally disappointing. It was very oily and plain (not traits you really want in a fresh breakfast) but the far-too-chewy crust created an unpleasant texture that I could not pallet. My boyfriend's meal was absolutely delicious though. All in all, a C+ or B- experience. If you do go here, don't get the quiche.",

This new menu sucks has sandwich's and burgers and then there speciality meals no variety. My family and I were very disappointed and left after looking at the menu. They're might be hope for Mimi's when we left the restaurant the manager asked us \"hey, why are you guys leaving?\" We explained our situation and  He explained to us that so many people leave because they don't like the changes that have been made. Mimi's will be changing the menu again this may. Hopefully  for the better.",

I had the tomato basil soup.  it was more lie marinara sauce.  It was so thick. Not what i expected.  It belonged on pasta not in a bowl.

As we were waiting a customer came out of the dining room and asked to speak to the manager. A woman came out of the kitchen and the customer complained that the food took a long time and wasn't good. She told him that she was the only one cooking and really didn't know how to cook.

    "text": "So, the 2 stars is because I typically would give it 4 but our horrible Thanksgiving dinner at this location would warrant 1 star.  Clearly they overbooked for Thanksgiving...this became apparent because I made a reservation a MONTH ahead and we were told it would be a 45-50 minute wait when we walked in the door at 1:45 pm.  What point is a reservation then really?  Only because another gal told us it would be 15 minutes and we were rather vocal about the situation did they manage to acquire a booth for us about 20 minutes later.   Then there was the food...past years we ate at another Mimi's and thoroughly enjoyed our meal and the crowd was managed much better. Additionally, there were snacks and drinks available for those having to wait to be seated (Note to Chandler location: this is extremely helpful when people are hungry and not expecting a long wait time after booking a reservation).  The salad and bread were sadly the best part of the meal...the sweet potatoes were so sweet none of us ate them and half of us wouldn't try the green bean casserole and the other half regretted that they did.   Additionally my husband and I ordered red wine and they ran out of wine glasses so they served it up in ??? perhaps a mimosa glass. Which not only made the wine hard to drink but, frankly, it just didn't taste the same.   The staff...good gracious, we could feel the stress the moment we walked in from the hostesses to the wait staff. Our waitress did the best she could considering the crowd but the anxiety all around was tangible and overshadowed our experience.   Definitely decided next year, we're doing turkey at home.",

The service was pleasant and fairly attentive although our server never came back to check if our entrees were acceptable. Seating at the bar was nice to watch the game...however the lighting is blinding. We requested it dimmed a bit and it was. Much nicer. Calamari was good, albeit boxed I'm sure. Wife enjoyed the muscles and I had the shrimp pasta. Beware; that pasta, while reasonably tasty..doesn't loo much like the picture. You'll get six boiled shrimp and if you are lucky maybe more than a few specs of broccoli. Don't expect much other than noodles with a pretty strong garlic taste. Meal wait time was exceptionally long given the very few patrons in the place also. Overall it was 'ok' for $14.29 but nothing to write home about. Pricing was reasonable with food for two at about $36. Wine comes in at $8 a glass but these are 6oz pours- sadly presented filling the glass (with bar pour marker used) only about 35%....if you only pour 6oz then use a smaller glass and the value would be perceived better. Lastly we got up at 8:05pm to leave. We were the ONLY two people in the entire place. That alone should tell you something...Stick to this place for breakfast folks.",

A nice feature is mimosas ($7) are available! The kids also had a lot of choices on their menuand it was priced just right $4.49. The pancakes were huge and it came with a side and a drink.  Also, it was nice that regular lunch items were available too.  The ambience is nice and the noise level fair.  Although the wait for our food took about 20 mins, I think, it was worth it because where my husband and kids usually go if I'm not with them is Waffle House so I know that the food is made to order and from scratch.

    "text": "Apprehensive breakfast visit due to the reviews of this location. Maybe it's a timing thing. I like to avoid crowds so I eat at off times. 9am in a weekday was perfect. Ample parking meant few patrons. I've been to Mimi's previously at other locations. Delicious choices of breakfasts if I'm not in the mood for my eggs, bacon, & hash browns (which I can have at least once a day for every day of the week). Today I had salmon Benedict. So happy with my choice. Loved the saltiness of the capers with the hollandaise sauce. Eggs done perfectly runny. English muffin held its own with all the oozy goodness. No onions for me. Crisp tiny whole & halved potatoes accompanied everything perfectly. Also order was the Santa Dr omelette. The 3 eggs contained all the tasty goodness inside rather well. The salsa had a good spot of unexpected heat. His came with a muffin which I almost was envious of while we waited for our meals. The strong dark coffee kept me distracted else I would have stolen a piece. Given the serious conversation in had a pleasant visit here. The waitress was attentive but overly intrusive. Atmosphere was tranquil till the lunch crowd meandered in filling the empty tables, about 1130ish.   I am in between giving a 5 star rating. It was great yet not quite perfect. A 4.5 if it is possible.",

    "text": "For Thanksgiving, we couldn't find a restaurant that still had buffet reservations available. So, a week before Thanksgiving I ordered a complete Thanksgiving dinner package from Mimi's cafe. Included in the package was a 10-12 pound brined turkey (fully cooked), Home style real mashed potatoes, gravy, fresh green bean casserole, sweet potato casserole, two loaves of carrot bread and cranberry sauce. My whole family loved it! Everything was moist and tender, all the toppings came with the meal, and the pumpkin pie was outstanding. It only took an hour and a half to warm up the turkey and fixings. We like this so much, we ordered it again for Christmas. And for $89, we feel like we got a great bargain. Much better than a local less grocery store establishment, famous for its yuppie clientele, that we used the previous year. And also much cheaper.",

I had heard from a coworker about their delicious breakfast, which I have still not tried, but my wife and I went for dinner. The service was exceptional, especially the manager, Jim. Our server was also very attentive and between our server, the manager, and our food our visit was exceptional. I ordered the garlic brick chicken and it was delicious. The only part of it I did not like was the chicken was still on the bone. It was a half chicken served with cheesy potatoes au gratin and a side salad. The portions were just the right size. I also ordered a cup of their French onion soup and highly recommend it. The bread basket was also delicious. I look forward to my next visit.",

My daughter's chicken was burnt, my son only got 1/2 his food and I didn't receive my order until my kids we almost done with their food. I asked for my waitress who was busy so I than asked for the manager. She wouldn't come out until she brought out our food and then blamed our server. I don't know how it's the server's fault that the food wasn't prepared correctly. She said she would take care of it. Well it got worse from there. The food that I waited for was cold, she did offer to recook everything but we had already waited so long I refused. When I got my check I was shocked to see I was being charged for our food. Burnt chicken, runny eggs, cold food and a nasty attitude from the manager, NO WAY! I told her flat out I shouldn't have to pay for our food and I would be happy to pay for our drinks. She again argued and stormed off like a 2 year old. I WILL NEVER go back to this place and can see why the place was empty. Note to manager: not good customer service to argue with customers. We clearly weren't happy and you could have turned this whole thing around if you would have been more understanding. Shame on you and your horrible customer service!!!!!!",

We had reservations at 9:15 and arrived at 9 and was told our table was ready. At 9:30 we were still waiting and when we approached the host he was very rude- snapped we were already checked in, said he had no idea how much longer and when I questioned why we were td our table was ready he responded \"i don't know what to tell you\". When we were finally sat it took 15 mins foe the server to greet us and food took an hour and a half. Bu time the food came my kids were done and I had to take them home and left my husband to eat with his Mother. So after 3 hours of waiting around I wasn't even able eat my Mothers Day breakfast.   I understand delays and running behind and Mother's Day is hectic but the amount of waiting, rude employees and lack of apology was ridiculous. If you consider making a reservation for a special day here I highly recommend rethinking it.",

But what happened today was completely the worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant. Took over 2 hours to get our food out, got 2 orders completely wrong, ordered a Bloody Mary with no celery and they brought out a new one twice with CELERY!!! Forgot my eggs and bacon had to remind them twice to get. Didn't get a refill for over a hour. Just a overall bad experience and it's unfortunate because the food wasn't even bad. Went over for a nice Easter brunch with the family and it was just ruined by this whole restaurant. The thing that bothers me even more is I asked the male manager directly I need to speak to him so he goes to the back and gets the other female manager to come out. He didn't even have the coconuts to come speak to me like a man. Pathetic. Do better guys please. Thank you.",

We arrived at 9:40a and were told we needed to wait in the 30 person line before we would be able to \"check-in\".. even though we had a reservation? We waited for an hour, watching several other people hover over the hostess and \"check-in\" before anyone would acknowledge us. We watched hostesses dart back and forth behind the bar so they wouldn't have to stand at the front and answer questions. Those of us at the front of the line kept asking the hostesses to go to the back of line (which stretched out to the parking lot) so that they could tell everyone else what was going on. The hostess would roll her eyes every time this was suggested.   What was truly disappointing was the fact that we never saw a manager come to the line and apologize for making us wait. No one had any useful information for us and they refused to give us a time-frame for when we would be seated. One staff member said \"It's like this every Mother's Day..\"  as if that should make it all okay? You would think they would have this figured out by now if it's \"like this every Mother's Day\".   By the way, we left and went straight to PF Changs across the steeet. Not only did they seat us right away but they actually have the air conditioning running.",

    "text": "It's been awhile since we came to Mimi's, this one.  The last time we came it was with my family, a large party of over 10 people.  And if I recall last time, the food came out sporadically and some people didn't get their food until others were nearly finished.  Thought that was a fluke, but this is now the 2nd time with a large party - our party was 14 people this time.  I don't know the name of our server, but he was a tall, Caucasian man probably in his 20s/30s with a short man ponytail.  The manager on duty was Jim Dekker.  I smiled at him as we were going to our table, which is in a more private area.  No one else was seated in that area, just my family.  In fact, the restaurant was not busy.  It was about 6 pm on a Saturday (18-Feb-2017).  It had been raining and I don't know why so few people on a Saturday night.  Our server got us our drinks in a reasonable timeframe.  Most of my family is comprised of Asian people, with the exception of my Caucasian sister-in-law and my husband, a Colombian man.  We ordered appetizers and that came quickly.  We ordered our food and that was not an issue.  We waited for the entrees to come and they did for most of the table.  Maybe 4 of us didn't get our food, but then the other 2 people's stuff came.  My husband and I waited and waited for our food.  Probably more than 20 minutes had gone by AFTER the first 10 people at our table got their food and 10 minutes after the other 2 got their's.  Still no food.  Finally our food came, but it was probably a good 25 minutes or so.  We were really hungry and my husband was really looking forward to the steak and fries he ordered.  Not once in those 25 minutes or so did our server come to us and tell us what the delay in our food was or anything.  He was nowhere in our area to be found.  But, the food finally came.  My husband had ordered his steak well done.  He said he wanted NO PINK.  I ordered a pot roast.  The pot roast was somewhat cold and the broccoli was cold, too.  The scalloped potatoes were hot, though.  So, my food had been sitting around for awhile before I actually got the food.  My husband's steak was close to the RARE side.    We motioned for the server who happened to be in the bar-ish area to come.  We said that we ordered WELL DONE and as you can see from the pink and the blood oozing out a little, it was nothing close to WELL DONE.  He gave us this look and without apologizing (we know it's not his fault personally, but apologizing for the cook), he said he'd take it back to have them cook it better.  We waited at least another 10 minutes.  My husband is super hungry by this time and some people at our table were already done with their dinner.  The server finally came back with the  steak and fries.  My husband cut into it and though it did not have any blood ooze from it, it was still about 1/2 pink - so Medium Rare.  Nothing close to WELL DONE.  He said he no longer wanted the steak.  I told my husband to order something else instead since the cook cannot be competent enough to understand what WELL DONE means.  It means NO PINK!!  My husband ordered a mushroom burger instead.  Waited another 15 minutes or so and it was now nearly 8 pm.  He's starved.  Everyone has finished dinner and still his dinner hadn't arrived.  Our server didn't come back.  By this time, my husband and I are irate.  I feel bad for my husband as well as everyone else at our table.  The server NEVER once apologizes for anything.  My husband decided that he no longer wanted ANY food from Mimi's and we just wanted to leave.  Oh, and this was a birthday celebration dinner, too.  I left the area we were in in search of our server.  Couldn't be found, but the manager, Jim Dekker was.  I explained the situation.  He looked at me as if he really didn't care.  He asked me what I wanted him to do about it.  I thought this response sounded sarcastic and indifferent.  And I'm sure he could see the look of frustration and anger on my face.    Then he responded by telling me he wasn't going to charge me for my meal nor my husband's.  Well, thank you for not charging us for my husband's meal that he never got.  We really appreciate that.  And, he said he would give us 2 free entrees at our next visit.  At some later time after the birthday cake was served, the manager went over to my sister, NOT me.  I don't know what he said to my sister and he gave her a card.  For one, my sister isn't married to my husband.  My husband is Latino.  Most of the table is ASIAN and we LOOK ASIAN.  My husband LOOKS LATINO.  Maybe to Mr. Dekker all Asians look alike.  My husband said to his defense, though he was upset, \"You and your sister do look similar.\"  Okay.  I'll give him that, but our server, unless he's really so not observant, could see that my husband looks different than the Asians.  AND, he was sitting at the end of the table next to me.  The manager and server should have been apologizing to my husband.  Why he was talking to my sister, idk?",

Food was served hot (surprisingly) but all orders were wrong. Never got refills on any of our drinks. Kept receiving food for other tables (which we were tempted just to eat after a while). Pecan pie was disgusting. Tasted like one big glass of burbon. So disgusting.   Nobody took leftovers home.",

I had the Ham n Swiss Crepes, delicious, cooked perfect, and great flavor in the sauce inside..   Also had a Blueberry muffin which was also on point..   I think most of the reviews on here might be from critical individuals who mainly only post negativity, which usually carry their own ego on their shoulder.. Mimi's I will be back..   Little costly, for breakfast, will try lunch next trip.. but well worth it..",

    "text": "If I could give Mimi's in Chandler minus stars, I would for the treatment my family received yesterday on Mother's Day.  We had a reservation for 10:45.  While it only took a few minutes past then to be seated, things went downhill quickly.  Our server was slow to take our order, and once placed, she disappeared.  Finally, at 12:15 I asked when our food might be ready and she replied \"I have no idea, I don't even see it on the screen yet\".  At that point we left, and took my very disappointed mother to Subway.  Thanks to Mimis incompetence in being able to properly schedule staff, they managed to ruin the day for my mother and our entire group, and we will never set foot in that location, or probably any Mimis, again.",

Sometimes you get someone who is phenomenal, but it depends on the busyness as well, but don't be discouraged if there's a wait. They serve breakfast all day and are very accommodating to the little ones as well!",

This was just a hint of what was to come which was the worst service & professionalism I've ever witnessed in a restaurant! And the food wasn't far behind. Had to get up to get our own silverware.....was told 15 minutes after we ordered that chicken wasn't available that night because 'it took to long to prepare'. Of course, this then delayed all of our meals. Waited over 30 minutes!! Seriously understaffed & the manager doesn't have a clue! But the customers are the victims like we were.

Those were the added inducement to get me to choose Mimi's over competing restaurants.  Supposedly this place is inspired by French cuisine.  I think that's a bit of a stretch, though they do try to create a French bistro ambiance.  Menu is sandwiches (including \"French dip\", so it must be French...right?), quiche (which real men don't eat ;-), pasta, pot pies, and some other stuff.  Despite my sarcasm, the food is pretty good.  If you're trying to choose between big casual chains like Chili's and Applebee's and Marie Callender's, well Mimi's should be on your radar.  It's at least as good as any of those.  Soups are good, French dip is good, burgers are good.  It's all solidly three-stars.  On this occasion I had an off-menu special item:  baked penne and meatballs.  It was nothing fancy, but I liked it.  Other folks in our party all seemed to like their choices.  If only they still had those decadent chocolate muffins...",

Our waitress was doing the best she could being the only one around, the hostess/manager was now where to be seen, people came in and stood at the door waiting to be seated for a good period of time...it was early eve so no crowds and no reason for not having someone up front and faster service. the phone was ringing and ringing no one answering. The food was VERY disappointing. If this particular Mimis is to survive they better get new management and clean up the place.  Won't be back there anytime soon.",

Kinda thought it odd, but as it became quite packed in the restaurant, I couldn't have been more pleased at our seclusion. Scott took great care of us from insightful recommendations to his sparkling style, that only he can bring. Today we had French Toast with eggs, thick bacon and amazing red skin potatoes. We also loved the Farmhouse Tacos: hickory bacon, sausage, potatoes, cheese, pico ~ everything but the kitchen sink stuffed in corn tortillas.  So happy to find this location. Will be back!",

Well now that I don't have kids nearby to cook for on Thanksgiving, we decided to try Mimi's for our holiday meal.  We had a reservation, and of course they were very packed.  We only waited 10 minutes past our scheduled time...we were very specific about the type of table we wanted.  Had our first course: french onion soup and Caesar salad = good.  Rolls=good.  Then our entrees.  Large portions, pretty tasty, but totally cold.  Asked the server to toss them in the microwave but she assured us that they did not do that.  We were brought  a second full serving.  Barely warmer.  Let them know.  Said we would just take it home and reheat.  The manager came to our table...JIM...and comped it all.  WOW!  Did not expect that...Classy Jim.  We will be back.",

Not one person in sight except one server helping her tables and she didn't even look my way once. After 10 min of standing there I, even though I was standing in the store, called them. When they answered and asked \"how can I help you\" I said \"hi I've been standing up front for about 10. Can somebody please come and help me?\" And they said \"oh sure\" and hung up. I still stood there for 3 min until someone came out of the kitchen to help me. When someone came out and ask \"how can I help you\" I asked if I could place an order Togo and she said \"oh well we don't really do in person Togo orders it's usually when people call.\" So I'm standing there confused... Do you want me to step out in the parking lot and call you and tell you what I want over the phone??? Is it not aloud for me what I'd like to eat in person? Meanwhile, I'm waiting to place an order for some muffins Togo, not even food they need prepare and cook, a party of 3 had been standing there waiting for about 8 min before anyone even looked at them. It was so weird. Some of the worst service I had ever had.",

We ordered, restaurant got a bit busier because power went out at Chandler Mall. Our selections were a tuna melt with house salad with  ranch, tomato soup and grilled cheese sandwich, quiche Loraine with a muffin and French dip and fries. Maybe 15 minutes to make? Please remember we were there before it got busy. Server brought muffin out right away. At 7:45 the couple that were seated after us asked what was taking so long for their food. Wa la.. 2 servers came out right away with their food. We thought we'd try that , and wa la, servers came out with our food! I'd like to say that waiting so long for our food was the bad experience, but wait.... My salad had vinegraitte, not ranch; the quiche was florentine, not lorraine ( and at this point with a very cold muffin); and the fries were awful. The lady who got her food right before us had ordered shrimp which was still frozen. Took 10 minutes for manager to come out of his hiding place to address this issue and his excuse was that they got busy.. We were the first 2 parties seated before they got busy. Our server never came by to refill our drinks, we had to get her attention; she never updated us as to why it was taking so long, and never once asked us how our meals were. Oh, and the fries? As we left restaurant, it seemed like everyone was in agreement as the plates still had all the fries left on them. Sorry Mimi's...we will never be back.",

    "text": "Yet another fancy rip-off.  This used to be one of our favorite breakfast spots. But after today and trying them for one last time, I must express my sadness for how it has gone down the drain.  This is a cute place. Very clean and cozy. We usually have to wait to be seated because it is very popular. This morning was no exception. We requested a table like usual. Now, I know my husband and I are not the most beautiful couple on the planet, but dang, making us sit in the very back and way out of the way of the general public really makes one feel like you really do not want us there. But at least we got a seat.  It took some time for our waitress to greet us and get out orders. But we can wait. We know its busy. She got our drinks really fast but disappeared for a long time. Almost 40 minutes before we got our food. She did fill my coffee up again for me at least.  When we got our food it was pathetic. The pictures in the menu of the crepes we ordered were full of fillings and almost round. My husband got the ham egg and cheese crepe. It was as flat as a tortilla with maybe a sprinkling of super-tiny diced ham and a thin piece of cheese melted on the top. The poor crepe. Some one deflated it and made it bland. I got the banana/strawberry/nutella crepe. Again so flat. Maybe a teaspoon of nutella on the inside. Did not really taste any. Then I was extremely lucky to receive 1/3 of a banana sliced up super paper thin and placed and the front a back of my crepe. The strawberries might have equaled and entire half of a full strawberry if you took the paper thin see-thru slices and assembled them into something solid. These are $9 and $10 dishes!! You could at least given me an entire banana and a whole strawberry. Maybe they had a \"see who can slice the most paper-thin slices of half a fruit and see if the customer notices\" contest with the chefs.  I also ordered a side of fruit. So for around $4 I got 3 super-thin slices off of a tiny clemente orange that was way past expired, and 5 whole red grapes. At least they did not cut the grapes paper-thin. I must be lucky to get 5 whole small grapes.  I understand about needing to make a profit, but dang people. At least try and make the food seem not like a super-rip off. We did complain to the manager and he wanted to just give us free muffins. We said thanks but no thanks. We will not come here again.",

But if I could ask one thing of them, it would be PLEASE BRING BACK THE OLD CHICKEN POT PIE! the new recipe is totally different to me, different crust, different filling (old style was creamy and thick, new style is runny and tastes like gravy) and half the size....oh dear! I've been a longtime patron, and the chicken pot pie was my comfort food standby. I have to find somewhere else that does up the chicken potpie right....Unless Mimi's goes back to the old recipe!

I've never been to Mimi's Cafe before so I'm not sure if this is normal. To me, it seems weird. Do I look like I need a drink?   We were thankfully seated at a table and given lunch/dinner menus, to our chagrin. I thought for certain we had missed brunch, but thankfully when we asked our server, she brought us breakfast menus.   My boyfriend ordered the brioche French toast and I ordered an omelette with potatoes and a muffin. Phew, that's a lot of food. The omelette was pretty good, but the potatoes were a bit forgettable. They seemed soggy, like they had either been sitting out for a while or cooked in too much oil. I tried a bite of the French toast and it was quite tasty-although too heavy for me. I guess that is to be expected from brioche so that's more about personal preference.   Overall, service was good. Our server was really friendly and helpful with the menu, and was prompt on refilling our coffees and waters. I wish more restaurants would just leave a whole pot of coffee at your table..or water. I drink water and coffee like it's going out of style but I digress. I haven't been to a place in recent memory that actually does that.  Price-wise, it seemed on par with a lot of places that I normally go to for brunch, however most of the places I go to aren't chain restaurants.   Overall, an a-ok restaurant. Not spectacular-but not horrible either.",

And half of it tasted burnt on the edges. The $5 red house wine was good though. My gf thought the Cobb salad was ok. Decent. The soup she got with it wasn't very hot at all. A tad bit over room temp...still tasted good though.  Anyhow, I've still heard things about this place. Maybe it's the breakfast that sets it apart. I'll probably try breakfast from here one day, and edit this review possibly.   Customer service was great though, if that means anything to you! :)  2 stars = me not really excited to go back.",

I went here yesterday and the waitress whoes been working here for a while should probably be careful when saying things when regulars come in!   I was with a girlfriend of mine for brunch and the waitress who serviced me a few weeks back while I was on a date came up and stated that the guy I was with, on the one date, prior to this current visit didn't give her a big enough tip!   The guy was a complete loser but it was my first and last date with him, however, she was clearly not happy with him! The guy was showing off and asked her to charge his credit card $10 for a tip but then when the waitress told him she couldn't do that, and that he needed to put the tip on the receipt he only left her less then 10% tip ...is what she stated!!   This is not a representation of me!! I am not in charge on rather or not some jerk doesn't tip properly especially if I am not watching him fill out the receipt.   I was also disappointed that she even mentioned this to me while I was with a friend because, I do not share my entire dating life with this friend.   During this same loser date, the manager even said, \"Everytime you come in here, you're with different people\"! I'm sure he didn't mean any harm by saying this but it came off as if,  I'm there with different guys but what he meant was I am there with different girlfriends, and groups.  It's my safe Haven place to meet people but maybe, I should find a different place to go!  Sometimes, it's best to keep quiet about things you see and witness when you work in a public place and see regulars!  I would've felt better had they spoken to me directly about their observations!! I'm going to find a new spot to take guest, friends, dates and different groups of people that I hang with!",

Worst of all the GM walked to almost every table checking how things were but never came to our table so I had no chance to share my feelings, other than making a scene. Here is the kicker...the trio comes with chicken, shrimp, and steak. Now the picture and description makes the steak look like some kind of steak but after waiting 45 minutes for it and taking it home, we found it was just ground beef. So just call it meatballs on your menu or admit to us that YOU RAN OUT OF STEAK AND TOOK AN HOUR TO PUT SOME CRAP IN MY TO GO BOX.",

We made a 10:15 reservation weeks ago, and when making the reservation (with the manager), asked three times if the regular breakfast menu would be available and he said it would be.  Flash forward to this morning, and there is a huge line just to \"check in\" with the reservation. We arrived at 10, and when we finally got up to the desk at 10:45 (half an hour past our reservation), we were told it would be an additional hour wait. Hostess was rude and wouldn't answer our questions. There was no apology, and the hostess refused to call the manager up. When she finally did, manager refused to come to the front, instead hiding in the back instead of dealing with the mess and angry customers. This kind of disorganization is unacceptable, and not offering any apology or letting people know at the back of the line that it will take hours for their RESERVED table is absolutely unacceptable.  We finally got a table, only to be told that there is a set Mother's Day menu with all of 6 choices. We have a vegetarian in our group, and there was only one option without meat. We asked the waitress about the regular menu (because we had confirmed twice before making the reservation that it would be available today) and she said they were not set up to serve the regular menu. We asked for the manager again and yet again he refused to come to speak with us. The waitress, Laurie, was the only saving grace and acknowledged that they were unprepared and apologized for whoever told us the menu would be available.   Needless to say, we left and will never come back. We know Mother's Day is often very busy, but management and the hostess handled the situation very poorly and offered no apologies or explanations for the sh*t show. If you can't accommodate reservations, don't offer them and screw up everyone's plans on what is supposed to be a special day.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Mimi's for breakfast! So lemme clarify with the star rating: breakfast/ brunch = 4 stars. Lunch and dinner = 3 stars. Their breakfast menu has so many lovely choices and pictures. K so here is what I have had:  Breakfast: Eggs benedict - Very good but a bit too much ham on it. Got to a point where ham was all I could taste Eggs florentine - AMAZING! One of the best benedicts I have ever had! Eggs are always cooked perfect, hollendaise is light and creamy, and I love the mixture of the tomato, bacon, and spinich. This is what I order most of the time. Used to get the eggs houssard which was the best but they did away with it which always happens to me! Crabcake benedict - Good but the crabcakes can get a bit overpowering and they turn this breakfast into a very heavy one. Mixed Berry Pain Perdu - Great for if you have a sweet tooth. They give you tons though and after awhile, its a bit too sweet at least for me. Still liked it alot though. Chipotle Breakfast Burrito - This is surprisingly very good considering its not from a mexican restaurant. Ciabatta Breakfast sammich - Very good but a bit too much meat for my liking. I think I will order it minus the ham next time. But the rest of it taste terrific. Quiche - Have had a couple different types (brocolli and cheese, crab and sweet corn) and I can say that Mimi's makes some of the best quiche I have ever had. Very light and flaky crust with fluffy eggs and great mixins Carrot Bread/ Blue Berry muffins - Some of the best bread and muffins I have ever had. Always warm and fresh Redskin Breakfast potatoes - Pretty good. I prefer greasy hashbrowns though  Lunch/ Dinner: French onion soup - Good soup. Better be good cause this is one of the things I think they are supposed to be known for. Chicken fettuccine - Was ok, not very memorable though. I liked that it had artichokes and sundried tomatoes but the sauce wasnt very thick and the chicken was kinda bland. Butternut Squash Ravioli with scallops - This was a special at one point and it was very good. The scallops didnt taste frozen like they do at most AZ restaurants and the ravioli were very light and flavorful. Unfortunately, I am not sure if or when this special will come back  So to sum it up, I am always excited to go to Mimi's for breakfast, however, I don't often consider going there for dinner. I feel that I should go and try more items for dinner/ lunch because the items I have had during those times were not bad. There is definately potential. The prices are reasonable and the service is good most of the time. Oh and I definately need to go back and try their bread pudding at some point to see if it makes the list of best bread puddings.   :)",

I had bragged up Mimi's to my son saying they have an extensive menu but when we looked online it was a lot smaller than I remembered.  When we got there it was indeed smaller and fairly ordinary to boot.  The food was good but the selection was nothing like it used to be.  And, unfortunately, for the first time my order was undercooked - and not by a little bit.  Wifey and I agreed that it is no longer on our list of personal favorites and that is too bad because it used to be her favorite.",

    "text": "two words: \"bonjour, y'all!\"  that is what is printed on the sign as you walk into this place. for most of you, that is enough for you to understand how i feel about this place. if not, i will expand.  imagine the restaurants in disneyland - fake brick features, a silly, comptely out of place new orleans main street decor. do you recall the simpsons episode where moe tries to turn his sleazy bar into a family restaurant, and sells it by saying, \"if you like a bunch of crazy crap on the walls, then come to Uncle Moe's Family Feedbag\"?  ....that's the feeling i get here: 'if you put stereotypical new orleans items on the wall (mardi gras beads/french horn), they will come.\"  i guess i can't be that pissed about it, becuase come they do - this place was packed. i'm pretty sure i was still drunk from the night before, and i wasnt' about to let go of my glory - boo to no drink specials, and no drinks besides beer and mamosas - not even a bloody mary. having spent the last four hours of beer time doing shots of sun kist, i was not about to even look at orange juice. thankfully, our server suggested a Hibiscus - champagne and cranberry juice- score!  in fact, our awesome server was this outing's only saving grace. she had a terrific sense of humor. the monterrey omelette looked fantastic, and the person who ate said as much. i had a quiche (like i said, i was drunk still) the crust of which was extremely greasy. potatoes were ok, better than your average home fries.   mamosas cost $5.25, but come with the mini bottle of champagne comes with, and most breakfast entrees come with juice - so you really end up with two drinks - not bad.  but seriously, the atmosphere is horribly family oriented.",

If you go for lunch or dinner the pastas are pretty good too as well as their sandwiches. It's a fun place to go if you run out of ideas, but I definitely suggest go for the pancakes.

Well, it's about 111 degrees today and they were all parched. We ordered several entrees and one person ordered extra muffins. I just thought it was ridiculous that they wouldn't honor the coupon considering the amount of money that we were spending. Also, they upcharged someone else at my table for getting extra onions without mentioning it until the bill came. I really like the food, but they are so wrapped up in nickel and diming people that I guess they aren't concerned about losing repeat business.",

It is rich, creamy, and full of big chunks of fresh clams. Couple that with a full menu of great lunchtime or dinnertime treats and you'll come away satisfied. The service was impeccable. The staff was very friendly and they work together as a real team to give their patrons a truly memorable experience. Love it love it love it! The muffins are great and when they found out my daughter hadn't been there before they gave her four muffins to take home with her absolutely gratis. I had the Cobb salad which never disappoints. My wife ordered off the two course special menu and got asparagus with citrus shrimp. My daughter had the salmon. Everyone raved about how good everything was. The food, the service, and the ambience is great. Two thumbs up...way up!",

My Thai wrap was extra-extrodinarily delicious.  I got the fruit salad.  We were completely mesmerized by the Bourbon Street jazz, funky New Orleans-style decor, and the absolutely magnificent service.  Fast forward to Santa Clarita, CA where we ordered and they brought the wrong dish.  Without batting an eye, our waitress quickly took away the wrong dish and brought the right one, with an extra loaf of that sweet, dark bread coated in oatmeal.  Fast forward again to Chandler, AZ. where we live now.  We have ordered almost everthing on the dinner menu, and ALWAYS been satisfied with the taste, texture, and amount (always take some home).   Next, to celebrate my 61st birthday, my wife and I are taking our friends to have breakfast.  Will let you know about that later.   All the best to everyone who loves MIMI'S.",

My first experience with Mimi's Cafe was back in Vegas, when it first opened on my side of town in Summerlin. The food and the service was deplorable. I vowed I'd never go back there, not knowing it was a chain...I should've known better.  Fast forward ten years. I'm in Arizona and I'm near the Chandler Mall. I don't want mall food. I didn't feel like In N Out and frankly, that hot dog man at Lowe's wasn't gonna cut it either.  I eyed Mimi's Cafe. Was it going to make me happy? The decor made me want to hurl. It's too busy. Too fussy, frilly, froo-froo girlie girl for me. I wanted to burn that checkered table cloth. Putting that weird plexiglass thing on top of that checkered table cloth? It made me feel like I was back at my mother's house and she would be screaming, \"COASTER!!!!!\" any time I thought about putting a glass down on any table.  Anyway, I decided to order the Turkey Pesto Ciabatta. While waiting, bread was brought to the table...but not just any kind of bread...we're talking almost like pound cake bread...like cinnamon nut spice cake. I wanted to cry. I had to eat it. HAD TO. IT MADE ME.  The Turkey Pesto Ciabatta  was heavenly. I can't believe that I had such good food. The turkey was warm, the pesto was nice...the bacon made me happy...I am still floored it was so good.  Maybe I'll have to try something else, but for now, Mimi's gets 4 stars. Sorry, no 5 stars...because my awful experience from Vegas is still forever burned into my memory.",

My first time back at Mimi's in many many moons, and it was for a friend's pajama brunch party.  And as we proved, almost anything goes as far as attire for Mimi's Cafe :).    The reason I stopped going to Mimi's was that, for the same amount of money, my mom (my normal Mimi's companion) and I could find amazing food, versus the just ok fare at Mimi's.  And having gone back again, my conclusion still stands.  The food is decent, and even good, just not spectacular, or wow-tacular or even yummy-tacular.  (I also reserve the right to completely make up words)  I'm an adventurous eater, and Mimi's... it's not adventurous... at all, which is great for people who want to have normal scrambled eggs (without cream/milk), normal breakfast potatoes, normal mashed potatoes (yes, I did order 2 forms of potatoes for my meal).   Mimi's Cafe is definitely for the faint of heart.  :)",

Apparently the wait staff was in as much of a hurry as the hostess, as it took the waitress another 10 minutes to bring menus. We hadn't been there in a while, and the first two things we saw were (1) a much smaller menu, and (2) much higher prices. We ordered and got our food, which was ... OK. Unless they were to drastically improve, the service in this restaurant is simply not good enough for the prices they charge.",

Similar look, bake goods on display on the way in (muffins instead of pies), and a couple of items on menu same as Coco's (Sam Adams Beer Batter Fish n Chips).  Compared with most Coco's in Phx area this place is cleaner, newer.   My problem was the food.   All four items we ordered were bad.  My kids got \"flatbread pizza\" and it was nasty, they could not eat it, slimy and falling apart.   My wife got some kinda pasta dish, they forgot the shrimp and brought out later, it was not good.  My french dip was pretty mediocre.",

Last night we got the usual: turkey dinner and strawberry walnut salad with chicken. We asked that our bread basket consist of banana bread only, as we usually do. Nick took our order - he usually does.  1. The salad had NO chicken, but we got charged for it, dinner size! 2. The bread basket had 2 slices of banana bread and the rest were 1 dinner roll (not even 2!! after all, we ordered 2 entrees!) and 3 carrot rasin slices.  3. Had we not specified the muffin flavor we would not have got a muffin at all, although it comes with the salad! Every time I order the salad and I don't tell them what muffin to give me, they just don't give me any. And if I don't ask for the bread basket I don't get that either, although it is complimentary!  I am sorry, I wish I could give them a 5 star review because their food is delicious, but they definitely do not know how to treat their repeat customers; the neglijence is unacceptable, especially that we get charged for things we do not get. We will most likely find another place to order from now on.",

I keep trying because I remember all the good meals we've had there but the last 3 times have been so awful that I will not be back. Ordered an old favorite..pot roast. It came out cold and dried out. Next time I ordered the beef bourguinon which turned out to be cold dry pot roast with a wine sauce poured over it. I was offered another choice so I took the pork chops. They came out in about 5 minutes raw. The manager came over and said she was sorry and that I wouldn't be charged for the meal. No kidding.  Last week I tried again. This time I ordered fish and chips because my wife told me she would divorce me if I ordered anything remotely related to pot roast. The fish came out overcooked and dried out which required tearing it apart rather than breaking apart in like most flaky fish does. I ordered garlic sweet potato fries with the fish which turned out to be cold soggy non garlic fries. When I questioned the waiter he told me that sweet potato fries were supposed to be soft cuz they don't fry crispy. I told him to ask the kitchen to try again which they did and were delicious the second time. Too little too late",

Anyway, Mimi's does a great job at doing what it's supposed to do. Nice family atmosphere, decent food, decent prices.

I cannot tell you how disappointed I was. I ordered the onion soup which tasted terrible and the cheese was not the correct onion soup cheese. I also had a Caesar salad and it was very bad. The lettuce was wilted and not fresh. Some of the lettuce had browned.  I had said I wanted the soup first and the waitress brought the salad first and said the onion soup was coming. At least 15 minutes later, she said the onion soup was just put into the oven for browning.  My main course, New York Strip steak, rice and au'gratin cheese potatoes came after a delay. I cannot tell you what it was like. The steak was a ridicoulous representative for a strip steak and it was cold. tough and not rare like I had ordered. The rice was dry and chewy, it was served plain. I sent the entire dinner back and the manager brought out a replacement, apologized and said he would take it off the bill. The replacement steak still was not a good representation of a strip steak. It was no more than 1/4\" thick (supposedly a 10 oz. steak). It also was on the tough side.  My friend ordered a something like chicken sandwich with gravy. He also said it was cold.  Very dissatisfied with our visit. I think they need to replace the cook and change the food items to better tasting representations.",

My wife had to go outside for awhile as she was freezing and needed to warm up.  I don't know what the temperature was set at, but the outside temp was in the low 80's.  My guess was it was in the low 70's or high 60's.   We will never go back to the Mimi's again.  My wife guessed that this store will close in 6 months.  I have to agree.   All this could be avoided with proper management.   I suggest everyone go to Chandler Fashion and eat at the Cheese Cake Factory.",

    "text": "Thanks for delaying my Thanksgiving this year! We pre-ordered and pre-paid for a Thanksgiving dinner box. My hubs picked it up, no problem. When we went to open it on Thanksgiving morning, the ham was missing. Ok, no biggie, yet. Drove 30 miles each way back to get the ham after speaking with GM, Tim, who was really rude and actually said, \"your order says you picked up a ham\". Yes, yes it does, but I wouldn't be calling if that were the case. We drove back to the restaurant, waited in line 40 minutes and got the ham (with no apology). Upon arriving back home,  we realized the ham wasn't \"glazed\" as stated. I called the manager back again and was told, \"just go to the store and get a couple jars of marmalade, assuming you aren't driving back here again\". The customer service was NON-EXISTENT. We spent just short of $200! The food was great but unfortunately they have lost our business.",

    "text": "We were back at Mimi's Cafe and I must admit after my last review in 2014, we had been back a few times.  At times service was good and other times service not so good.  I am reviewing our last experience.  It seems the food is fairly consistent and that's good. Service is different.  It is inconsistent.  This time there were four of us and Frances was our server.  If we had exceptional service, I would boost about it at Mimi's.  In the same breath  I will say this was about the worst service we have had at a Mimi's or any restaurant in a while.  We were seated fairly quickly.  However, it was a little bit before our server finally arrived to take our drink order.  Then, it was longer yet until she showed up again to take our food order.  It seemed forever until our food arrived.  We didn't realize that she must have forgotten to even put the food order in until we looked at the time on our bill that it was given to the kitchen.  We had a mighty long wait to have our breakfast brought to us.  Then, she never checked back to see how our food was or even refill our drinks until they were empty.  Her mannerism was curt, never friendly.  Obviously, our tip reflected it but even that was too much when we realized the kitchen didn't get the order until we had sat there for a mighty long time wondering why it was taking so long.  Terrible server.  We're thinking this Mimi's is one to cross off our list.",

We were seated by a very fun girl who was speaking French with my girlfriend. Don't get her started,hehee. Anyway we got a nice booth in the back. Our server was very attentive. The funny thing was he told us his name was Chance and when the Manager was checking on everyone to see if they were good ,he called him Zach. Plus the check said Zach. Oh well everyone should have fun at work I think. Anyway, our food was good, we got the Fried Zuchcinni. Which is always good at all the locations we have ever tried.  It is very lightly Breaded and comes with really good Marinara sause. I got the Pot Roast, my Gilrfriend the Salmon. Both were very good, just wxtremly saltly. We were so thristy even into the next day. Food was good, just too much salt for seasoning. Service was good. We will go back for sure.",

    "text": "Dreadful meal.  I ordered turkey, dressing, broccoli, cornbread, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce.  It all came smothered in gravy - NOT on the menu.  I asked for a replacement without the gravy.  The turkey was NOT real turkey.  It tasted like processed.  Had been soaking in watery something that left it with an off - processed and flavorless taste -  no wonder they smothered the first one in gravy.  The broccoli, although was not overcooked, was tasteless - tasted boiled.  Nothing on it, not even herbs.  The dressing was watery, mushy and although not a bad flavor, was not very flavorful due to the watering down.  The cornbread was missing from the plate - I had already had the plate exchanged so I did not want to be bothered telling them that they forgot the cornbread.  The mashed potatoes were decent, pretty good, nothing to write home about but, not bad.  The cranberry sauce was so sickly sweet that I could not eat it.  When I eat turkey at home, I have a heaping 3/4 cup of cranberry sauce.  I could not eat any of this.  I also took the turkey home to my dogs.  A most disgusting meal.  I don't know how they stay in business.  Will not go back.  Husband called it SAD - Standard American Diet.  It was obviously not prepared by any chef.  I bet I could choose a house at random off the street and find the cook of the house could do a much better job than that.  I do not go out to eat garbage but, this is what it was.  I did not exaggerate.  Lastly, our table faced an air filter in the wall near the ceiling, about 24\" x 16\".  It was filthy - coated in dust and muck - disgusting.  My guess is they NEVER bother to clean it.  What else do they never clean?",

The soup- that the server warned me was HOT, was only hot on top and sent back. Our food took 30 min to come out and there was only 3 tables in the whole place. My well done burger was RAW in the middle, sent back, and i had to ask if it was ever coming after everyone else was finished eating. The manager brought it, apologized, took 50% off our bill and gave us a TERRIBLE dessert. Lol Why does it make me sad to say it was awful, because this used to be my FAVORITE place to go...

My favorite part of this restaurant is the breakfast food.  Lunch/dinner aren't that great to mention.   However they do have coupons for dinner which give you starter, entree, and dessert for a good price.  So for that reason only I would go for dinner.     Now on to the breakfast.  The meals come with your choice of juice and some even come with a muffin.  My favorites on the menu are the eggs benedicts.  For the original: the flavorful ham center the dish.  It's a bit tough for me and the saltiness overpowers the dish.  But it does add a nice contrast to the gooey egg and sauce.  I would say the eggs are \"over-cooked\" for egg's benedict compared with some other restaurant.  I would've preferred over-easy or even over-medium eggs insteads for an eggs benedict.   The hollandaise is thick enough so that it isn't runny that would drench the dish, however still thick enough to have that creamy consistency.  I wish it had more flavor though.   It comes with red skin potatoes on the side.  With just the right amount of salt, it complements the eggs benedict well.  Try the florentine, and crab cake florentine eggs benedict for a twist on an old favorite.      Wake up early for breakfast or brunch for an eggs benedict and shop 'til you drop at the mall after you have satisfied your tummy.  However don't expect too much from this mediocre restaurant unless you have a coupon. :D",

I have to say that this was one of those that I should have just stayed home. Woke up late this Sunday and the wife and I decided to go in search of breakfast.  After passing up a few of our regular options? We decided to give Mimi's a try.  We were seated promptly and the server was right over to take our drink order.  The coffee was good. We placed our order and then waited. 15 minutes later we watched 2 servers carry out food all over the dining room searching for the right table. They found us after someone else came over and pointed them in the right direction. My entire breakfast was cold. My wife's was hot. Not sure how that happened. Meanwhile my coffee cup is empty and there is no server to be found. If a manager had checked on us I would have sent my breakfast back. The waitress finally delivers more coffee and the check. We just started eating and she brings me the check!? I suppose we need to get out. My wife and I left 3/4 of the breakfast untouched and then tried to pay the check. After 15 minutes the server comes back for the check. (Apparently they didn't want us to leave too quickly.) I probably should have said something but the waitress should have seen that we hardly ate anything.  Oh well. No need to return. This place is not worth it.",

I am so, so disappointed. Scratching this place off my list.  My review from 2015: We were shocked at how good this place was.  Man... From the reviews, we had really low expectations. But I wanted cinnamon roll French toast and Coco's is an 18-mile drive from us, so we tried Mimi's.   Eggs perfectly cooked. Delicious thin bacon, not thick and chewy like a lot of places. Cinnamon roll French toast and brioche French toast were both a knockout. We were seated quickly and served quickly.   New favorite breakfast place.",

    "text": "After reading a ton of negative reviews about this place, I was skeptical to pay them a visit in the first place. However, I am glad I did. After waiting a little while to be seated (which shouldn't have been the case since they were fairly empty at the time), I found that the place was very peaceful, clean and well maintained. The variety of options on the menu looked appealing to me, and I found some healthy options as well. I decided to go with the smoked salmon baguette with salad, and the house coffee. The food came out pretty quickly, and tasted quite well! The sandwich was a little on the salty side, but nothing overwhelming, and the salad was fresh and well made. I am not sure if I visited on one of their better days, or if I just got plain lucky, but my experience certainly does not resonate with most of the reviews I found here on Yelp. I will certainly try to return soon to taste some of their other items! :-)",

I was thinking I wanted some typical breakfast food and honestly my gut told me to leave as soon as we walked in but I didn't listen.   This place appears okay from the outside but once inside it feels old, dingy and neglected. We were seated in a booth next to a small window and the dust was so apparent and thick on the window ledge it immediately grossed me out.  I don't think I'm old enough to eat here but my grandmother could have appreciated it.  The eggs were served cold as was the toast and the over cooked home fries. I like crispy bacon but thankfully hadn't ordered it that way because had this been served any crispier it would have broken as they put it on the plate.  The manager came by the table to ask how things were and I told her it wasn't great as everything was served cold. She offered free muffins, I politely declined but was thinking free muffins? Seriously, I wouldn't eat anything from here, ever again.  Bad food, over cooked food, cold food and horrible atmosphere.",

Special occasions, birthdays and celebrations were always at Mimi's. We were planning to have breakfast at Hash in Friday but the wait was over an hour so we decided on Mimi's. Something in my gut was telling me to leave but I didn't listen. From the dark musty dining room, to the several other un-happy looking diners to the waitress literally yelling across the room to the hostess seating a party in her over capacitated section. Mimi's would be a perfect scenario for Gordon Ramsay's 24 hours to hell and back.  I am less than impressed with the breakfast menu. Nothing really sticks out as being really delicious or unique. We returned my husbands breakfast since it was incredibly soggy and undercooked. The kids breakfast lacks creation, two cold pancakes cut in half to resemble a dog?  I solemnly leave a negative review but this place needs a MAJOR and I repeat, MAJOR makeover-revamp-remodel-restart.",

I got the turkey dinner entree, but exchanged the turkey for grilled salmon and they did that without any issues. I also had a mango mimosa which was delicious! The coffee was fresh and kept s topped off. I usually get their strawberry lemonade which is amazing but I was feeling a little Sunday funday! Parking is super open and never packed since it's in a shopping center. Our waitress was attentive and came to the table several times to check on on as well. Overall great experience!",

The dressing was far more mashed (and mushier) than the potatoes. NOT GOOD. The waitress was slow on service but had a mildly nice attitude. She politely apologized for the slow food service and said the reason was  because they had a BIG PARTY that they were caring for.  WHERE? There were only 6 patrons in the building and I was one of them.  Also this establishment smells like onions and dirty carpet. I figured that out once the waitress left our table with out drink order. Yes. Sadly, initially I thought that smell was her.   All in all I don't suppose I'll be back. I would classify the lack of a great dining experience as a management issue.  **TIP: clean the carpet and wipe down the booth seating to reduce the unpleasant atmospheric smell.",

I don't remember it being so let's say \"old fashioned\", maybe just this location.  I'm not sure.  It's dimly lit inside, old booths, not a huge crowd and not the cleanest.  I received a BOGO coupon in my email inbox so I said let's go!  My boyfriend and I came to Mimi's Cafe last Sunday (9/26/18) for a late brunch.  We were seated immediately upon walking in.  There weren't many patrons in the restaurant around 2pm.    Still .... we waited a while for the server to come to the table.  We waited a while for our entrees.  We waited a while for refills of coffee and hot water for tea.  In fact, I flagged someone else down for refills because our server was no where to be found.  We didn't receive our muffins until we were almost finished our entrees so we just packed them up to go. We tried the muffins when we got home ... they're no where near as good as they were before.  Something happened.  Something changed.     My boyfriend ordered the waffle meal with scrambled eggs with Pepper jack cheese, turkey sausage links and a honey bran muffin.  Skip the turkey sausage links.  We both took 1 bite and left the rest there.  I don't believe it's turkey or maybe really cheap turkey sausages but they didn't taste good at all. I ordered the corned beef hash with scrambled eggs, potatoes and the new pineapple upside down muffin.  The food was lukewarm, nothing special.  If I didn't have the BOGO coupon I would have been extremely disappointed with brunch.  I'd return, only if I have another coupon and if I'm in the area.",

Service was not that great, one waitress working a entire area herself, the hostess was not a friendly person either. Now for the food...the bread basket has changed no longer is the carrot raisin in the basket. Sad to say my favorites off the menu too. The chicken pot pie gone, the chicken crepes gone, grilled cheese sandwich gone. The special was something I think called Mac and chicken not even on the menu and it was so bad could not even eat. The dinner did not include any vegetables or even a salad. It consisted of penne pasta and a Alfredo sauce with parts of leftover chicken. Yes it tasted like warmed up leftover chicken thrown into the pasta. So after all the years of enjoying this restaurant my favorite place is now the worst place.",

I called the main number and it just rang.  Finally a man in a chef jacket came and angrily seated us.  Then we sat at the table without being greeted.  Then the two servers who came out were deciding whose turn it was to take us.  We explained our challenge to the server and she apologized and said she would take good care of us.  So felt better.  After ordering we watched 5 other groups of people have to stand out front waiting to be greeted. One older man was irritated and started walking to find someone.  So a bus person or dishwasher came out and started seating people.   At one table the customer asked about great banana nut muffins.  The server said not nicely, we have NEVER had banana nut.  It just was really rude. The croissant I ordered came out and it was stale.  I told the server and she said she thought they had fresh ones in the back and would get me one.  Why serve stale ones when you have fresh ones?  My partner was having a croissant breakfast sandwich do at that point we decided to ask for check and go.  Definitely not coming back again.  Horrible experience.",

I figured I could find something I could eat. When we got there it still looked the same but then we got the menu. They have pretty much completely redone the menu from what I remember. It is all French cuisine now. Which I was questioning at first. Really this place is French now? This ought to be good. I finally decided on the Croque Madame. Which is an open faced ham and Swiss cheese sandwich with a fried egg on top. It was really good. I was shocked. I really was. Very good flavor. Everything worked together. The ham was seasoned and cooked just right. Was this the right place. I say they have changed for the better. Don't know how popular the new menu will be because the general public seems to be leery of food they can't pronounce but I hope it works out for them. I will be back and will tell others about it was well. I really was shocked.",

The bacon and eggs were good but I was most pleased with the fresh fruit that accompanied it, ripe and tasty! Another had the waffle and turkey sausage. She said the waffle was good but nothing special. She didn't like the turkey sausage flavor. Service was a bit slow but we weren't in a hurry. They offer mimosas and other morning drinks if you're looking for that. We weren't but it's nice to have the option.",

    "text": "I just don't understand why anyone eats breakfast at a place like Denny's when you can go to Mimi's and have SUCH a different experience (like servers who haven't been up late drinking the night before).  I have always loved this place (it's on my A-OK chain list), especially for breakfast.  The atmosphere is cute and charming, the servers generally seem to be a higher caliber and I love the variety of flavors on their breakfast menu.  If you sign up for the Mimi's e-club, they instantly send you a coupon for a free breakfast (up to a $10 value).  With items like Pain Perdue Stuffed French Toast, Eggs Benedict Florentine and a Chipotle Breakfast Burrito it was a difficult decision.  I, however, settled on the healthiest option (I checked the caloric content on the website), the Capresse Omlette which was just delish and includes diced tomatoes, red onions and basil topped with sliced tomatoes and fresh mozzerella and a tomato cream sauce which I ordered on the side.  My dining partner ordered the Ham & Cheddar Croissant (a whopping 1,235 calories, but apparently worth it) with breakfast potatoes.  So, along with being a price Nazi, I've become a calorie Nazi.  Most of the breakfast entrees include a freshly baked muffin and fresh squeezed juice.  It was a perfectly delicious and very filling breakfast.  Our server was just fabulous and I gave her double the tip I normally would have since I used the coupon for a free breakfast.  I can't wait to come back here in a week or two, and BTW do try to come during the week if possible as the wait is significantly less.",

The reservation was to eat, not to check in to wait 2 hours to eat!! ALSO not the first time this has happen to us at this location. Staff was doing NOTHING to apologize or offering to make their mess up right with customers.  DONE WON'T BE BACK!!",

We waited for quite some time at our table with no servers coming to greet us or bring water--to make it clear that we were ready to order, I closed my menu and sat waiting, but no one came. A female server was walking back and forth to the other tables but never acknowledged us, so I had to request for a server to come to get water, at which point we were ready to order.   It's 100 outside, and I'm 7 months pregnant. Bringing water and acknowledging your customers should be commonplace in a restaurant, especially during summer months.  Our server, once he finally came out to help us, was friendly.",

Called the morning of thanksgiving to verify out reservations only to find out we were not on the list. Mimi's told us they would add us to the list for our original time of 5:00 p'm.  Got there at 4:30 pm and when we checked on our reservations found out that we again were not on the list. They called the manager and I explained the whole story. He then penciled our name in for 5:00 pm and told us we would be the first 5:00 called. At this point we talked to many others and found out that they were running about an hour behind. Why not over book, where are all these people going to go?! One hour comes and goes, hubby goes to check only to have the manager tell him he doesn't have time for the hubby and turns and walks away. Finally they cleared a table for us. Turkey and stuffing were good. Rest of the meal was awful. Not with the $18 a meal. Will not go back there. The two stars are for the waitress. She was awesome.",

We had made a reservation for a 3:00 pm turkey dinner in hopes that there wouldn't be much wait for our party of 4. Little did we know hundreds of others did the same thing and many more walked in placing their names on a list. The little wait we expected turned into a 30-45 minute wait.   After we were finally seated, the wait began again. Waitress and after waitress walked past us ignoring our table. No water were brought and not even a \"we'll be right with you\". So we finally got up and approached the manager after a food runner was kind enough to bring us waters. The manager went around and asked the 2 waitresses working all 4/5 tables surrounding us and none of them took responsibility or seemed to want our table. Little did we know this was a blessing in disguise.   Monique was given our table even though it seemed her section was no where near our table. She turned the whole meal around. She was attentive, kind, threw in some jokes and really was a sweetheart.   Given that it was thanksgiving, the meal was good for it not being my home cooked meal but it was pretty tasty. Also the serving size was huge which allowed to reach that \"over capacity\" feeling everyone deserves in turkey day. Mimi's is a good choice if you are looking for a holiday meal. But on any other day try and get Monique as your server. You won't be disappointed.",

More recently I have expanded my palette, and I also come more often for breakfast.  The California Avocado BLT omelette is mouth-watering (minus the bacon).  Get the potatoes fried with onions and peppers for an extra burst of flavor!    For lighter appetites, the blueberry muffins can't be beat.  There's also a seasonal flavor (pumpkin? red velvet?) that's usually pretty fantastic, so ask your server!  For brunch, try a mimosa or sparkling wine flight.  The coffee is also pretty good, though I'd be even happier with some flavored creamers.  Mimis has something for everyone!",

One of the hostess' (please tell me why there were 4 hosts and none of them knew what they were doing) looked at the list longer than she should have and said \"a couple more people.. about 5 more minutes.\" Waited a little longer and my bf went up to see the status. Turns out our name was never on the list. WTF? Really?? They were lying to us.. all 4 of the hosts were clueless and unorganized. After that we got a table and the service was terrible. Took 10 minutes for my bf to get his coffee and water.. even more to get the waitress' attention to get our check.  Worst service ever!!",

We sat next to the waitress station and I see the tea sitting in ice. Of course it's getting watered down. Why can't they serve it over ice as it sits room temp. Now back to our waitress, she forgot our bread and my water with lemon. So I did drink my husband water. And still didn't get mine till my food came. Bread came just about 3 minutes before food. Took one bite of the bread, and she said he you go! My husband like his turkey sandwich and I had the French dip. Which was good except my French fries soaked in ajus on the plate. All she can say oops my bad I shake a bit. Soggy. Not more lunch or at least when she's there. Gayle was her name. Which we didn't catch her name till we seen it on the receipt.

The turkey and Brie melt concept was great, but with only one slice of Brie and a smaller than expected portion size, I was a little disappointed with the execution.  Taste was good, but at the risk of sounding like a snob, it really didn't compare to Parisian cafe fare.    My advice?  Trim down the menu substantially to focus more on a few items and get fresher ingredients if you're going to imitate the French cafe experience.",

Were told it was approximately a one hour wait. Waited for over three hours with no table only to be told they were no longer seating due to long kitchen ticket times. Asked for a table to at least sit and have coffee (most of the tables in the restaurant are empty at this point) and we were told no. Manager was extremely disrespectful to a handful of elderly couples just wanting an estimate of time. Old blonde hostess with the purple flower in her hair was the nastiest person I've ever seen working in the industry. Ignored questions, mean looks to customers, not one smile. She was the worst part of the experience. Disappointed in the fact that there was no communication to guests.

    "text": "Decent food, but the environment is surprisingly noisy. Tonight, we got stuck next to a woman (likely a single mother) with a VERY noisy brood of undisciplined children SCREAMING.   There's no way the help or management at Mimi's couldn't hear it, but out of fear or apathy chose to pretend it wasn't happening.  Others around us were staring at them too.   Like I said, usually good food and I like how they offer soft drinks to go, but way too noisy of a place. Especially a place that tries to be a bit fancy.  Advice to management: don't worry about being \"mean\" by telling undisciplined kids to use their inside voice. Everyone around you will appreciate it.",

I did my first order here to to go and when I got home I was disgusted. I ordered the half roasted chicken that looked amazing online and I got a thin dry piece of rubber and burned cold fries. I will never eat here again. I would give zero stars if I could.",

They burned my lunch mates bread for her sandwich and when she made comment to the waitress, no further addressing by staff took place. Would hate to see this \"institution\" go but first impressions say management doesn't care.",

The egg white breakfast rates great.  The restaurant was not very clean.  The bill was over $45 for three breakfasts. Way to expensive.",

Afterwards, manager took so long to come out and with nonchalant attitude said sorry. I cannot believe how terrible I felt as a customer. Manager needs to shape up and relearn customer relations. He still did not apologize sincerely for the spoiled food. When I mentioned it at the end when my check was brought out, he simply said how would he have known if the food was spoiled. Its his restaurant. Whethet he knew it or not, food was spoiled. Apologize first rather than give lame excuse to a regular customer. They just lost a regular customer.",

Oddly my wife ate here about two years ago and the same thing happened.  She stayed that time, we didn't this time.  The food may be good but I wouldn't know.  The service and management is most surely lacking.",
