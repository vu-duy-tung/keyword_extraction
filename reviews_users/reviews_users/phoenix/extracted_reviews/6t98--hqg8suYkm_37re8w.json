    "text": "After driving back from Hollywood for a weekend trip, I got home tired and hungry. I called in an order for two Karl Katsu's with Tonkotsu broth. Having ordered pho and ramen for pickup before, I asked if they separated the noodles to prevent them from getting soggy and gross. They said not only could they do that but that they typically separate all the toppings from the broth.   Cut to 10 minutes later I pick up the two bowls which have nothing separated. Not a deal breaker but a bummer. At least I hadn't thought it was a deal breaker.   Not mentioned on the menu are the confetti shreds of seaweed in the ramen. Unfortunately it's an intolerable flavor for me. I definitely would've asked for it to be removed. The way it's cut makes it impossible to remove plus the flavor is released into the broth immediately.   The ramen was inedible. The katsu chicken was soggy and lacked any texture. The seaweed wrecked shop on the broth. If the toppings were separated, I could have at least given the thing a chance. Just like that, out $27 and I still had to eat something else.   We tried to pawn it off on the kids who were excited as they like Cherryblossom. Text message a few minutes later: \"Mom take the ramen back. It's bad.\"  Maybe I'll go for drinks but I won't be back for ramen. Consider some standard setting on your takeout orders.",

I went again last night with my husband and mom. I raved to both of them about how good the ramen was. Ordered the same meal last night. The broth was totally different and whole dish overall horrible. Was told the broth changed to miso only. Would have been something to share before we ordered. The whole ramen dosh was bland. My husband and I ordered the same thing and were sick later that evening. We won't be going back.",

    "text": "This quite the satirical restaurant. It has a humor. But it's hard to get. Not for everyone I would say. Laid back in many aspects, but passionate all around. New restaurant with working kinks. Struggling with a poor pool of cooks, who have possibly given the place a bad rep. Homemade kimchi. Home made tofu. Home made broths, as expected, fermented chef inspired spicy sauces.   It's confusing. You walk in and you're encouraged to sit anywhere. No host stand. The joke has started. A bar next to the line. Low light. Hipster Asian inspired decour. Japanese whiskey. Funny name. Get it? Neither do I...   What I can tell you is, the cooks, the two I talked to on a Wednesday night, really cares what they did. Manager and bartender, though at first didn't give me the hour of the day, did provide a pleasant restaurant experience afterwards. Definitely suggest sitting at the bar/chef's table. Get the mic drop bowl. You won't be disappointed. Actually, it made me re think of my life decisions. Share the cauliflower. Sip on a whiskey on the rocks. Enjoy the vibe and local art work. It is located in Roosevelt row after all, the art district of Phoenix.   Phoenix is an up and coming scene. From someone in the culinary industry, though some dishes on the salty side, like the kimchi, you will enjoy a great evening in this restaurant. It's still new, keep that in mind. Give it a chance.",

    "text": "Quick summary: SO GOOD. Great service, decent price, easy parking, Tso Tso cauliflower was tasty, delicious ramen. Ham fries.   My boyfriend and I have been searching for spicy pork ramen in Phoenix that is as flavorful as a place we tried in Denver. We tried the top picks in Phoenix but in comparison they tasted like watered down chicken noodle soup with some Oscar Meyer lunch meat mixed in. Although I work for a local restaurant company and enjoy eating out, I don't consider myself a food connoisseur by any means. However, I can recognize when a dish has a ton of flavor! My friends suggested we all try this place, which they'd enjoyed in Flagstaff.   We went last night (Thursday). The service was great. I wish I could remember the server's name, but he was attentive, knowledgeable, and fun. We shared Tso Tso cauliflower (amazing). The Balls of Fire were pretty good (I mean, it's deep fried Mac n Cheese) but in my opinion they rely too heavily on the Sriracha for flavor.  My friend got the Sweet Chili Glazed Udon, which she enjoyed.   Two of us got the Tantanmen ramen. The server warned me that the bamboo shoots are not listed on the menu and have a distinct flavor that people may opt to leave out. I'm not terrible picky so I left them in, but he was right! It was still delicious, but I'll leave 'em out next time.   My boyfriend got the Mic Drop. Appropriately named. Pork belly, crispy bacon, HAM FRIES (HAM FRIES?!?!) in 15 HOUR PORK BROTH. That's the trick, guys.  After a long search, I think we've finally found our go-to ramen spot.",

Our experience was fantastic and everyone was very welcoming and accommodating. We started with the Daily Cheech pork cracklings which were suuuuuper addicting (I'm taking some home). I had the Mic Drop and it was mindblowingly good. My friend had the Mr Karl Katsu which was also fantastic. Our cocktails were perfectly crafted. I'm a gin drinker and loved the June Rose. We finished off with the carrot cake which was VERY unique and delicious. I work just down the street and will definitely be referring this place to our customers. Can't wait to come back and see their full menu.",

    "text": "Came in w a longtime gf last night to catch up and was pleasantly surprised after reading some of the mixed reviews. For those of you who complained that the food is spicy well, don't be such a wuss cuz it was hardly spicy!! Also it wasn't bland nor were the portions small like some of you complained about. It's a ramen/noodle place and it was very flavorful w huge portions!!! So whoever complained that the portions were tiny, well I had to take a to go box since I couldn't even make a dent in my noodles!! I grew up living in LA and being Asian, I have extremely high standards when it comes to ramen/noodle places!! What I really appreciated was all the different types of hot sauces they had that accommodated the dishes you ordered. We started off each with a glass of Sauvignon Blanc wine. The wine was really good and it was a good size pour. We ordered the balls of fire which are spicy mac n cheese balls. Our server brought us different hot sauces that would go well w our balls of fire! I loved this hot sauce pairing!! The mac n cheese balls were amazing!! Crispy on the outside and warm and gooey on the inside! Then I ordered the mothra which is soba noodles, tofu, broccoli in curry. Our server brought out more hot sauces that would go perfect with this dish!! Perfect pairings and the noodles were amazing!! I would have liked the soba noodles a little more al dente but it was still absolute heaven in my mouth. Overall, I am very pleased with this spot not to mention I could walk here. I highly recommend this place and for those of you who try it, to keep an open mind like I did and you will have a wonderful experience!!",

That doesn't make me a ramen expert or anything but the phrase \"I love ramen\" is an understatement. Thus, I don't have high expectations for ramen in the U.S. but Sosoba surpassed all expectations. The flavor of the broth and the noodles they use are PERFECT. I wish the portion sizes were a little bit bigger. And the soup to noodle ratio felt a bit off. Felt like there was barely any soup in my bowl but it could've just been because the bowl was a bit small. Overall, highly recommend this place and I'll be back A LOT.",

The Mic Drop was not that great, which might have been because the flavor was so strange....  The Tantanmen was pretty decent. The flavor was quite nice, but still it didn't have that full hearty/savory flavor that authentic ramen has. So I would say it was ok. Nothing special....

We asked for a suggestion from Christopher for something good he liked and his response was \"define good\". We were not checked on once the food was served, no offers on refills for our drinks and two different times called over another server for assistance that Christopher should have took care of being that he was our server. Its understandable that it can get busy and overwhelming especially catering to multiple tables but we felt like more of a burden than welcomed customers.

The environment is so relaxed and the music is upbeat and chill enough to have a good conversation with your significant other or friend! I loved that it was very clean inside, finding parking was a little odd but once you do find parking and get to sit down and eat it is totally worth it! As far as the price point goes it's a reasonable price for the delicious food you get. My husband and I will definitely returning. Next time we come we will be eating outside as winter weather approaches us here in the valley. Perfect for a intimate yet relaxed date night!",

SoSo-Nah, SoSo-Huh?, SoSo-uhhh, SoSo-blah, etc.  Had high hopes for this place bc I love a nice bowl of ramen, but I think Merichelle's review said it best- \"emphasis on the 'SoSo'\"  I came, I ate, and I have no desire to return. A pretty forgettable meal that just really didnt impress on the flavor front. I ordered the Mic Drop- just like a salty cauldron of some items that all varied in mouthfeel. it lacked the complexity that makes ramen great.  I would say try it for yourself. Maybe I am wrong. but I didn't taste what I needed in order to want to return",

We came in here after a day of drinking and walking all over downtown and ramen is always a delicious option after a long day. Ramen is a good comfort food for me and I've had good and bad bowls but I keep looking for the good ones. Sosobas mic drop is bomb it's really good it's one of the few bowls I can remember that i didn't have to add any spices or sauces because the broth was on point. My  ladys bowl of ramen was also so good and she loved it. Also our bartender / waiter was so chill and friendly and very welcoming. Also he made some mean drinks he made us a mai tai and it was refreshing with a perfect amount of alcohol. The place was nice and for a late Saturday night the service was fast and courteous and tasty. Great job guys",

    "text": "This is a very original take on a very traditional dish. The atmosphere here is Hip Hollywood with an asian fusion twist. With red and dark wood everywhere and the exposed kitchen speaks Japan teppanyaki (though no teppanyaki is served here) but none-the-less Japanese style.   The bar menu is a mix of original homemade items (i.e. bitters from their Flagstaff location) and fresh ingredients like their shiso, ginger and juices; all are a respectable price too. The mixologist Marie is wonderful to talk to and very lively and fun.   Now of the food. The pork \"wings\" are a must order, drumettes of pork tossed in a cherry teriyaki sauce over a bed of mixed greens and fried togarashi noodles, I mean what's not to like. It pairs very well with the Mai Tai. The noodle bowls here are the perfect size, not large, but enough food for you to feel great afterwards, to have enough space for desert (I'll touch on that in a second). The Mic Drop is a great bowl of everything, some might say it's to busy, but in my experience of Noodle bowls, everything that is in a bowl is there for a reason per the chef, and if you want to customize your bowl, this is not the place to go to. Great tonkatsu broth (cooked for 15 hours) and 6 ways to have pork in one bowl is a great example of what they can accomplish in one dish.   The staff here was very friendly and happy to make small talk, and they are proud of their dishes. The Hatch Miso Carrot cake is a beautiful way to finish the night. It's a rich dessert for one, but a perfect plate to have while sharing a conversation with friends over another libation.   Overall a great place to eat, the atmosphere is laid back, the people who come are as unique as the dishes they order, and if they ever make their way to Los Angeles, I'll be sure to be first in line.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "This review is based on the quality of the food alone. On a Wednesday night whim, I decided to peruse my midnight options and I opted for this place because the pictures looked promising - albeit trendy. I ordered the sweet chili glazed udon, the tantanmen bowl, the Mic Drop, and the fried calamari.   I have a tendency to go a little overboard when trying new places and since this was my first time coming here, I decided to sample the selection.   First off - the fried calamari. It was actually very tasty. Sweet, which was definitely not what I expected but still really good. I liked it. No complaints here except for maybe the portion size. It was TINY.   Next is the chili glazed udon. Now, imagine what it would taste like if you mixed boiled udon noodles, fried slices of pork belly, and a bottle of your favorite sweet chili sauce from any Asian market. Are you imaging that? Good. That's exactly what this tastes like. It's lazy and lacks any real flavor.   Now for the Tantanmen and the Mic Drop since they're both in pretty much the same category of horrible. The broth for both of these soups was both bland and salty at the same time. Like, how tf do you do that? I'm both repulsed and impressed. It's like they took whatever no-flavor pan drippings they could find, boiled it in water and added sodium. And that freaking sucks because any ramen lover will tell you that the broth is half the experience, if not 90%. Good ramen can't be done without good broth.   And to add insult to injury, the portions are laughably small. I don't mind paying a premium price for something amazing, but when you're charging me twelve friggin dollars for a bowl of lukewarm, salted sink water, you best believe I'm a take this personally.   Overall, it was over $50 in disappointment and regret. Nope. Never again. I'll stick to Republic Ramen in Tempe where the ramen is made with sunshine and rainbows, their prices are super cheap (less than $10), and the bowls of ramen are literally 3x the size of anything you'd find here.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place, so I feel bad I can't give it more stars. Honestly, 3 is a stretch, but I so badly want this place to be good that I might even give it another try. I was introduced to their food at the Devour food festival this year. Their kimchee tostada and ramen broth was on point, so I had high expectations coming here. Sadly, it didn't make the mark. Maybe it's wishful thinking, but I'm guessing the place was just having a bad night. First round of drinks came out quickly, but once the place filled up, service got shaky. We waited for a pretty long time and when food came out, we were served way before our friends' plates arrived.  It wasn't all bad, my bonal negroni was perfect- nicely balanced with a big ice cube (which I love).  The dump truck salad was a nice mix of veggies and tepary beans (which you never see on menus- nice touch!). Unfortunately, the soy-citrus salad was lacking both soy and citrus flavoring. It just tasted like the salad was tossed in oil.   We ordered the mushroom lettuce wraps, but were given the pork belly instead. The waiter apologized and eventually brought us the right order. The slices of mushroom were covered in a very thick soy glaze. The sunamono salad was good, but there wasn't much of it. The lettuce we were meant to wrap it in was actually gross- brown on the edges and wilted- the kind I would throw straight into the compost pile at home. Fail.  We ordered the tantanmen ramen bowl The fried tofu balls, which we ordered to replace the ground pork was the best part. It came with a few mustard greens and bamboo shoots. The promised soft egg was missing- boo. I did not like the flavor of the broth and didn't want more than one bite. This is definitely not the same broth they served at the food festival.  I would have given up on this place completely, despite the fab cocktail, but our server made me want to rethink that decision. After my girlfriend (who weirdly loves the color yellow, dogs, and North Korea) commented how much she loved the poster of Kim Jong-un hanging in the bathroom, he gave her one. Super nice gesture... and it was a a cool poster.  Would definitely return for a negroni on the patio, but not sure on the food.",

    "text": "Just an (honestly and truly) awful experience. Aside from the polite and expedient gentleman that packaged and rung my order, there are no redeeming qualities to ensure my return. The entire experience was confusing, repulsive, and pricey given the overall positive reviews provided.   My fiance and I ordered two bowls of the pork ramen and an order of the steamed buns totaling to $40, which would've been more satiating to watch burn in my hands.   Do not order the pork ramen. The protein in the bowl was literally ground pork with barbecue sauce, there were a mere two stalks of bok choy, minimal dressing (scallions/sesame/etc...), and the traditional half of a soft boiled egg. There was barely a ladle of broth in each bowl, which was neither sufficient nor palatable! It's as is if they attempted to marry the broth with kimchi, which resulted in something more putrid than pleasing. Nothing seemed fresh, which was so disappointing after a long day at work.  Please coach your staff to keep their cell phones in the back and the sports chatter to a minimum; or at least learn to read the room. Guests were quietly enjoying drinks and dinner-- it isn't a sports bar.  I pride myself in being the furthest thing from a picky eater and someone who can forge through any meal for the sake of being polite, but I was physically repulsed by my ramen. I literally gagged mid-meal. Both my fiance and myself had to chalk it up to a loss and toss the meal, for fear of getting sick.  Next time, I'll make the trek across town where the ramen never disappoints. Never again--you couldn't even get a \"So-So\" review from me, SoSoBa.",

Next we ordered a couple appetizer before our food, the Macaroni Ball which was actually pretty tasty. (The only enjoyable food we had) Of course for main meal we wanted to try the noodles! My mother and I ordered the Mushroom Soup and my fiance ordered the Katsu Ramen! The Mushroom soup was disgusting We could not even finish our food. The Katsu Ramen was decent but I have had better. On top of that the soups took 35 mins to come out. Like come on it is just soup!! In addition they only had one waitress on staff covering the entire restaurant including hostessing!

Out of nowhere his demeanor changed completely and he was extremely personable. He provided decent service with refilling waters and asking if everything was ok but his attitude came back often in the hour I was here with my friends.   We ordered the Yakisoba, Katsu Ramen and the  Tantanmen. Prepared quickly, maybe less than 10 minutes. My friend complained that her noodles were undercooked and her broth had a very salty soy flavor. It was masking the taste of everything else. My other friend said his yakisoba was very bland with no dimensions. Had tons of veggies but all you can taste is soy sauce. My tantanmen was very salty as well. I didn't eat the pork bits in the soup but my friend tried it and she said it tasted funny. I ordered a side of crispy tofu and that was the highlight of the entire meal. (That should say a lot about this restaurant if the best part is basic crispy tofu). The peanut sauce that comes with the tofu was not good. I hated it and I usually love anything with peanuts! There are plenty better ramen restaurants (even in this area). I will consider giving this place another try but not worth the drive or money.",

Ive been walked by several times and then finally after being walked by quietly I'm told I'll be right with you. now the lady who walked in after me and sat at the other end of the bar is getting served. Then when I address it she then gives me every reason why I was being ignored. Then she tells me oh I know her. Beyond unacceptable. Is this how you treat new patrons or just patrons that are darker because I'm the only one in here that's black. If I wasn't hungry and visiting this city where I know NOBODY, I would leave!!! Honestly I'm not even going to review the food. I asked for the manager of course conveniently he's not available. I hope this is not what I'm going to deal when I move here next month. She credited the buns I ordered, but I don't think people understand the importance of customer service or not being treated like they are invisible. I love visiting new spots and trying little eccentric places this is a place I probably won't return to this place.",

My first sign was I came in on a Friday and there was not a single person in there! One of the cooks were on the patio smoking a cigarette which I found odd. Usually they go out back for that kinda thing...  I usually get the SUV. It's my go to dish. I've had it 10 plus times and remember the good ol days very well. They used to have tons of ingredients and it was a very hearty dish and I left happy and satisfied and full. They had beans and these long red hair things and different greens and a spicy pepper and it was just very hearty. Bursting with flavor!  Now however, the dish is has just changed so more it doesn't even remotely look or taste the same. The broth is more watery. They replaced the beans with cheap potatoes, the red hair things with shaved carrots and tiny tomatoes, and the greens were soggy and overcooked and just not great. Even their ramen noodles taste soggier. It was not appetizing at all. I'm so sad this place has gone downhill. I will no longer come back here. Their time has past and they lost a customer.",

In addition, it doesn't taste remotely like soba or ramen. It's just salty broth with udon. 12$ for that is absurd. And their appetizer sweet chili calamari was just plain diabetic sweet.

We arrived at the end of happy hour and I ordered Tso Tso Cauliflower and 2 Balls of Fire. I'd go back for the cauliflower. The crust on the Balls of Fire was rancid, so we peeled off the outer layer and enjoyed the mac n cheese on the inside.  We came ultimately in search of broth and noodles. While I found that with my Mic Drop, mom's  Mr. Katsu was all noodle and very little broth. She had me taste the carrots within her dish, she described it as perfume-y and mushy, the flavor to me was fruity but the one thing it didn't taste like was carrots.  She wanted broth-y ramen and that wasn't it.   As for my Mic Drop, I would have to say the star was the chicarron. The soft egg was strangely mushy and salty, the pork belly good, the ham fries I mixed in along with the carnitas, smokey bonito flakes and scallions. I can't say I was impressed by the broth or flavor, but it was made better when I encountered the brine-y kimchi  in a bite. I did enjoy the texture of the udon noodles.   Would I go back? Yeah, eventually but most likely for happy hour and not necessarily for the food.  Would I recommend it? Meh, it wouldn't be top on my list of other places to try in the area.",

Although, my experience with this business was bad and undeserving. My girlfriend and I went for a walk with our dog and decided to check out Sosoba as we were passing by. We were looking inside from the sidewalk and then we began to check out their small patio from the sidewalk. At this point we were rudely greeted by a douche employee who walked out and with arms crossed blocked the patio entrance. He processed to say no dogs allowed. Not sure if the kid has a background in bouncing... but that's not how you greet potential customers in the restaurant industry. Anyways, on our frequent walks we have seen a number of dogs on their patio... The odds of them all being service dogs are pretty low...   Attitude like that comes from the top down and we have already let a lot of people in the community know to just keep walking when it comes to Sosoba.   Don't waste your time or money guys.

They do not serve typical ramen dishes, so if you're looking for that, I'd recommend somewhere else.   I built my own bowl (ramen, miso base, and pork). It was edible - nothing special really. Good, but not unique enough for me to come back again. The miso base was a teensy bit spicy but nothing too crazy. They give you ground beef instead of slices of pork (comparing it to chashu) and it's hard to pick it up with chopsticks. Regardless, I finished it.   TL;DR, don't come here expecting real Japanese noodles. If you like experimental fusion, then this might just be your place. The place lives up to it's name - So-So.",

    "text": "I am a huge ramen fan, so when I saw SoSoBa was opening near my house, I was hoping the Phoenix location would prove to be better than the Flagstaff location (which has terrible food... I do not understand the positive reviews). Unfortunately, this location was equally not awesome. Again, this place is highly regarded by critics, but I don't understand it because the food is overpriced and just not good. A friend and I came late -ish at night (around 10). We started with cocktails, which were actually fairly good. I tried the Heyday Mainstay which was essentially a moscow mule. It's the reason for the second star. For food, I tried the tan tan men (which I was excited to see on their menu because the rest of their ramen options are taken from the Flag location and I have already tried them and know I don't like them). My friend got the Mothra (essentially noodles in green curry). My tan tan men was 12$ and the bowl was about half the size of any other ramen bowl in town. I asked the waitress if the bowl could be made extra spicy.... it was not spicy at all. She then gave me a bunch of sauces to add to the bowl to make it spicy (which were good, but didn't complement the flavor of the ramen). The ramen lacked flavor and the pork had a weird chew to it. I disliked it so much, I did not eat the leftovers I took home (which is completely unlike me). The Mothra was better, but not by much. The tofu was nicely fried. The green curry was lacking in overall flavor. Both my friend and I were not impressed.   PS - we returned for drinks a week or two after we had the food, and had mixed experience. Their raspberry drink was fairly tasty, whereas the Osaka Smash was pretty much undrinkable...so strong.... ugh.",

    "text": "Well I suppose for the concept it's interesting. Good vibe, attentive wait staff, seemed to be a cool hopping little place but the biggest flaw lies in what the restaurant is by their own admission \"unabashedly unauthentic\" boy do they have that right. Let me make this very clear, this is NOT a ramen shop, period, end of story. If you are looking for drinks and a place to get some moderately decent bar food it will work though. First and foremost the ingredients are all a la carte so nothing blends, it's all made to order. Now this sounds great in theory because it allows customized orders but it also splatters the integrity of ramen all over the floor. I always have to wonder what chefs think when they throw dishes together and my only thought here was \"American American American American\". There is no subtle nuance to the dishes, no artistic blending of ramen and pork, every flavor comes out exactly like it is cooked, on it's own. I like my ramen to be in harmony but it felt like all the flavor profiles were in competition with each other. And beyond this the pork was even a bit dried out. There is a damn good reason the rule of ramen is to first taste the chefs creation before adding your own spices, ramen is art, and this is a pale imitation. The stars are for the excellent staff, but the bastardization of my favorite comfort food means they get no more.",

Unfortunately, it was $32 a bottle! Whereas the Japanese sake I got was $12 a bottle and tasted better in my opinion. We also got edamame and their Mac and cheese balls. The edamame was seasoned with a spicy seasoning that was flavorful but it could have used more salt. I didn't try the Mac and cheese balls, but those who did said they were good.",

You all around killed that dish.  The drink I had was the heyday mainstay and that was great- the server described it as a Moscow mule kind of but with a twist. I'm not a huge fan of Moscow mules but I went with it and I'm glad I did. Part of the reason I dont do Mules is because of the mint, it's too much sometimes. BUT DAMN couldn't even tell. It was very refreshing!  Okay now let me get to the decor cause those paintings are amazing. Your coworker is amazingly talented, and they are a beautiful creature   while I'm sad they won't sell the hot n cold painting- I respect it. It's a powerful painting that is mesmerizing.

On this fine lunch, I had the Mic Drop. It was MONEY. The ham fries, the pork belly, the carnitas and everything else worked so well together. The broth was soulful and full of umami. I'm not a ham guy but those ham fries had so many levels of flavor. The Pork belly was fatty but crispy at the same time and just melted in my mouth. Honestly, the only thing that could have been better was the ramen egg. It was cooked right with the runny middle, I just wished it was soaked in soy before.   I also had the bad bao. I'm like 95% chinese and these baos were sososososo good. I had it with the pork belly and it has forever changed my life. The bun was soft and sweet and a little crispy. The hoisin sauce was sweet with a deep savory flavor. The Pork belly was heavenly. If it wasnt so expensive, I'd probably eat 30 of them.  The restaurant itself is tucked in the middle of a tiny street. Parking was rough. The interior of the restaurant was clean but small. I do not recommend having a large party. There was no wait. The server was AWESOME. Polite, quick and helpful. He hooked us up with some extra sauce and our water cups were never dry. The place is a tad pricey and the servings are small but for a broke guy like me, it was worth it.",

    "text": "Well it's my birthday and we thought we would try this ramen place we frequently drive by, it looked very promising!  We get here walk in, no one greets us, finally someone walks by and says sit anywhere. Okay it is a seat yourself place.... cool. We walk by this decent selection of sauces and I see a sticker that instead of reading \"People love is on Yelp!\" It reads \"People hate is on Yelp!\" I tell my fiance and we laugh about it think it's one of those punny stickers.   The waiter is legitimately sitting at a table with his feet up. He came by dropped off waters... okay courteous. There is one other table here dinning. He Never once made eye contact, never asked how our evening was, didn't introduce himself, very unprofessional, and just honestly felt disrespectful.   He walked by once after picking up the tab from the other table and gave a thumbs up and said everything good and walked off. No time for a reply, just kept walking.   Food looked really good! But tasted like someone else said, \"Lukewarm, salted sink water\"  We never got straws, I had to go up to the bar and take some, never were asked if we need anything, it was the most unsatisfying experiences I've ever had. We have NEVER left a $0 tip, but when the experience is this bad how can you not?   Gross food, I left hungry, shitty service, no manners, the place was f***ing EMPTY!   It is now just us in here and we are waiting for the bill. We don't get the bill until another customer walks in and he immediately gets up from the booth where his feet were propped up and walks over to make it look like he is working. We get the bill and he returns to the bar where he continues to text and be on his phone.   Pretty big disappointment. I think my 8 year old niece can provide me with better customer service and a better tasting Maruchan or Top Ramen noodles.   Needless to say, I think the sticker wasn't meant to be punny, but True. \"People hate us on Yelp!\" Is probably the only thing this place has going for them.",

I've had some pretty damn good ramen, so my standards are kind of high, but I like to keep an open mind...  I got the tantanmen with pork belly. The presentation was fantastic! The pork belly was not as tender as I like it, but still flavorful and crispy on the outside. The egg was perfectly soft boiled (whew). The noodles and broth were actually really good! I wished there was more broth, so I ate a third of the noodles and requested more. It could definitely afford to be soupier but they'd need bigger bowls and prob have to sacrifice presentation. But the best part? It was actually spicy! Nothing is ever really spicy when it claims to be so I was especially pleased with this. :)  I loved the cocktails and admittedly got a little carried away. Osaka Smash, June Rose and White Linen. They even serve Fernet! Also shared the Balls of Fire and Cauliflower with a friend but we were too full to really enjoy them. Still tasty.  I feel like this place probably wouldn't fly with pretentious ramen snobs since it isn't really traditional, but I still thought it was delicious and would absolutely revisit!",

After about 10 seconds one of the line/prep cooks smiled and said we could sit anywhere. That was nice of him to do. We sit down order the food. The bartender/waiter that was helping us was friendly and nice. The food was on point. No complaints there at all. I was however disappointed, after receiving my $32 bill, that he decided to put the to go cup in front of me to do. C'mon dude....I know we're a young generation and not so formal but I'm paying $32 dollars for lunch for two. It takes 5 seconds for you to put the noodle bowl in the to go cup. It's completely dead in there so it's not like there's any rush! Then I look and see that the  suggested minimum gratuity on the bottom of the receipt is 18%. Ok so I'm suggested to pay almost $40 for a meal for two and I can't even get the server to put it in the to go cup for me? That's either laziness or lack of focus. I'm sorry, I can look past the other stuff, but when you can't even do something the requires the bare minimum of effort that is irritating and made me resentful of the whole experience. If he had forgotten because he was slammed with service that's once thing but it wasn't busy at all. Maybe it's entitled of me but when I'm expected to pay almost $40 for lunch I don't think what I'm asking is unrealistic. If management disagrees with my assessment that's fine but then don't tell me what my gratuity should be on lunch for two.",

    "text": "Very so so soba. The weather finally cooled down significantly today so on this cloudy day with light rain, we were really looking forward to some hot ramen. We've been to the Flagstaff location twice and it was great, so naturally we were expecting more of the same- but it turned out to be quite a disappointment (especially for $12 ramen). I got the Mic Drop. Both of our ramen broth tasted very watered down and tepid temperature as many here have repeatedly noted - same temperature as a cup of coffee left out for 15 minutes. It definitely didn't taste like \"15-hour tonkotsu broth\" as written on the menu. Not only are the portion almost 1/2 the size of the Flagstaff location, but there's also not enough broth for the noodles. When I brought up the issue of the broth not being up to par compared to the Flagstaff location, I was told they opened recently and the kitchen is smaller, so they're unable to make broth to the standards of the other location. That struck me as quite strange as the Flagstaff location is a tiny hole in the wall - like Japanese studio apartment size. However, this location is at least 8-10 times bigger! It's huge. So why would the kitchen be smaller?! It makes zero sense. I was told they will expand the kitchen in a couple of months. We'll see. Maybe I'll give it another try in 3 months during happy hour. The service was good though. But the food portions, flavor, and quality are seriously lacking and need to be addressed quickly.",

Sifting thru the menu my group was really excited having to see 2 magic words, pork belly and bacon. Service was quick, server was courteous, but that was probably only the best thing in this place. We got The Mic Drop, Mr. Karl Katsu and Tantanmen. In a cold fall night, it would be nice to have piping hot soup, yes? No, our bowls came in not warm but TEPID. Too much going on in one bowl, too salty, not enough broth, flavors not complimenting each other. My husband noticed my bowl of half eaten soup and he said we're not coming back here. I asked how his soup was and he said, a chicken broth from the hospital would have done a better job. That sticker on the little \"check book\" saying People Hate Us on Yelp? Yep!",

They have a good start with the overhead lighting and the addition of the hanging lanterns on the patio.  But there's a lack  of ambiance in the restaurant and patio.  Low lighting in the way of candles is needed on every table and especially on the patio.  In this neighborhood, a warm, inviting patio is huge!

Menu was very limited and hard to read as many of the ingredients I had no clue about. Waitress did not know her menu either and apologized by saying that they had changed the menu since she was last at work and that she only worked on weekends. What a brainiac! Why does she even work here? Had to ask for plates and silverware as I don't do chopsticks. They have no knives, so all I got was a fork. Ordered 2 appletinis. Waitress said they don't have the ingredients to make that, so I ordered a cosmopolitan and a whisky drink for my friend. Ordered 4 balls on fire which were okay, but only the sirachi made them this way. Dump Truck Salad with chicken and a noddle bowl. Salad had way too much basil on  it, and was filled with low value nutrient vegetables like corn and carrots. Dressing was okay, but again was overwhelmed by the basil. Waitress did not know anything about the menu, and had to ask others. As for my friends food, it was about as impressive as the salad. $60 was the final bill for lunch. I will never go back. The place was way understaffed and it showed. I could not wait to leave.",

When we walked in, we were instantly greeted in a kind manner and were able to choose our seats. We were impressed with how well they opened up the inside area. The menu was smaller, but we thought there was a good variety of options with the ability to modify the recipes to your dietary needs (ex gluten free, vegan, etc). We had the mac and cheese balls to start which were good. We both had a different bowl (SUV and MIC) and loved them both! The ingredients and all the flavors were amazing, and the noodles were great!  The portions were generous and enough for two meals. The service was friendly and the food came out quickly. The only recommendation would be to work on the seating on the patio since it is such a small space, especially with fall around the corner. I'm so happy to have a good new restaurant with a different variety of food and late night hours in the downtown area.",

The server we had was really friendly and helpful. Bonus points, the check comes in a journal. So as you wait you can flip through the book and see how witty the customers before you were.

    "text": "Been here at least a dozen times since they opened.  The ramen flavors are very nice.  Great cocktails as well.  I really miss \"half-y hour,\" but so it goes.    Two points for improvement (in my opinion): the last probably six times I've eaten here, the broth/noodle ramen combo is lukewarm to room temp, at best.  Why?  Ramen is supposed to be piping hot, and eaten that way.  Maybe this is by the chef's design, I don't know, but I don't understand it, it's way better when it's hot, and that would seem to be something easily accomplished.  Second point, the ramen is now usually served with minimal broth.  If you ask for extra broth they'll give it to you, so that's an easily solvable 'problem.'    Overall, some of the tastiest ramen bowls I've had in the valley.  And I've been most other places.",

Service was terrible, food was even worse. We were greated at the bar probably 5-10 minutes after we sat, not the worst other than there was only one table in the restaurant. He didn't ask anything other than what we wanted to drink and eat. After the food was delivered I took one bite of the mathra (the same bowl I order every time) and wanted to spit it out. It tasted completely different, no flavor, no spice, different noodles, and the tofu was undercooked. I asked for more curry sauce to try and save it, after the cook handed me a bowl of cold curry I almost walked out. Now my foods cold and I'm still hungry. Our katsu tasted like water... we were never asked how our food was and about 20 minutes later when I was asked if I wanted a box after only taking a few bites I replied no. We were handed our check with out even being asked if we wanted it. Our tab was $40.18 I left $40.25. I have never in my life not tipped someone at least 20% but to be quite honest they didn't even deserve the 7 cents I left. Flagstaff come teach this location how it's done!",

The nice thing about this type of bread is that it's fluffy because it's steamed. That means it can absorb a lot of sauce and flavor. The contents of the sandwich were dry and had zero sauce. To top it off, they stick the bao on a griddle, which meant that this bread, supposed to be steamed and fluffy, was now crunchy. It was super weird. I don't know. It didn't taste bad, but it was nowhere near as good as it should've been.",

There's a bunch of ramen options in the valley so save yourself this one. The Tofu isn't vegan (god knows how you screw that up), so you're basically left with broth, noodles and corn when they pull out all the animals. Unless you're me, then they leave the eggs in it and still charge you when you return it and ask not to have it remade. And that's $12 for water, noodles and some corn mind you. Probably do just as good for what you get going to the dollar store, but again, I got eggs in mine, so who knows what it tastes like. I'm guessing broth and noodles.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for SoSoBa. We're always looking for places to eat downtown that have decent vegan options. The menu was very promising - several items either were vegan by default or could be made so with small tweaks.   We started with the Fried Tofu and Thai Peanut. The tofu squares were great! They were lightly breaded and fried perfectly. The peanut sauce was more like peanut butter with a bit of soy sauce, with sriracha on top of half of it. It wasn't bad - it just wasn't great. Admittedly, I'm a peanut sauce snob, but this didn't come close to being crave-worthy.  For the entrees, I had the S.U.V. with tofu and my husband had the Yakisoba with tofu. The S.U.V. had a light but fairly bland flavor. The tofu was sparse and the same type as the appetizer tofu. I wanted to spice up the sauce but it was a very unique green curry flavor so I couldn't figure out which of the multiple sauces offered in the cart would work with it. It was a generous portion, so I ate just enough to be full.   The Yakisoba was similarly underwhelming. The peanut sauce was more \"saucy\" than what came with the appetizer, but the dish needed more soy sauce to add flavor. It was actually fairly dry.   I'd like to think maybe I just didn't order the best items, but I wasn't impressed enough to want to go back. The service was fantastic and the location is great. I really wanted to like it more!",

    "text": "On my quest for delicious ramen led me to SoSoBa! I was searching for somewhere different with a little fancier style ramen than what I usually get and I found it here.   SoSoBa is a cute restaurant tucked away in downtown Phoenix. After looking for a parking spot in the nearby neighborhood I met up with my fellow foodie and we headed inside. It wasn't too busy and we were able to pick a table to sit at. The waiter was very friendly and brought us some water and let us know we were in time for Happy Hour. Yes!   We ordered some Mai Tais which were the upscale fancy version. The amaretto soaked cherry was delicious. The drink wasn't the overly sweet and was very good. Then we ordered the Katsu ramen, Mic Drop ramen, Bao Buns with Bulgogi Beef and the Macaroni and Cheese balls with Siracha.   The broth in the ramen was flavorful and my Katsu chicken was crispy and there were lots of veggies. The egg was cooked perfectly. The Mic Drop had lots of pork! LOTS! My friend enjoyed it very much. The Macaroni and Cheese balls were good but not great. They could be cheesier. They had a perfect crisp to them though and the Siracha was a great addition. My favorite part of the meal was definitely the Bao Buns. Everything was good about them. I could probably eat the buns alone they were so good. The beef was tender and flavorful.   I highly recommend coming in for happy hour so you can sample some ramens and drinks at 50% off to see what you like. I will definitely be back. It's a cool little spot to have a fun dinner with friends.",

You can choose what type of noodle you would like in almost every dish listed.  We tried the General TsoTso's Cauliflower and found it to be delicious. The slightly sweet sauce was a nice addition. The deep fried Mac & Cheese Ball was just ok - nothing special.The Viet Nom Nom Nom salad was good as well although, we only found 1 kernel of corn in it!! I enjoyed the mushroom Bao buns, but the others in our group did not care for them. The Hostile Takeover with tofu instead of meat was enjoyed by all, but we do wish we had chosen a different type of noodle. We were to full to try dessert, so we will  to leave that for another day. Our waitress was very nice, friendly and helpful.",

It is open late for late night bar-goers.  Park in the public parking garage off 3rd Avenue, near the Pita Jungle. This faces south and is within the Roosevelt Square apartments, Building C.   Service: So so. Sometimes, I had a very attentive waiter, but other times, the person is rarely around. I guess it just depends.   Food:  The soups are pretty good though rich.  I wanted to like the mac n cheese ball, but it was just somewhat bland. The texture is just right - delicious fried crusty crust on the outside of the rich melt in your mouth mac n cheese, but the cheese does not have any flavor. The soups are filling, and could easily be shared.   Drinks: Unique interesting drinks. They can be costly.",

The quality of every dish we tried was just so bad: started with the fried cauliflower appetizer, which had none of the umami-rich, fully coating sauce we'd so enjoyed in Flagstaff, but just tasted like dry roasted cauliflower with an oddly lazy drizzle of a sort of peanut sauce? Ever the optimists, we moved on to our respective entrees with hopes still intact - the Mr. Karl Katsu and Hostile Takeover. Oh, sadness. The former was a bland mess of inedibly gummy Ramen, the latter literally fettuccine noodles (seriously, WTF) in an over-salted broth, and both were almost insultingly small portions. Overall, the food here was so bad we couldn't finish it - the two stars are for the gracious staff who took our feedback with understanding and comped the (mostly uneaten) meal. I'd love to see them improve and bring the quality up to par with the original SoSoBa, so we can support the business and staff here.",

Visual wise, they looked similar to the one we had in Flagstaff, loaded with goodies. BUT the broth was lack in flavors and seems like watered down.

    "text": "I'm always excited when the possibility of something resembling a Ramen place pops up on the radar here in Phoenix. We were spoiled living in Vancouver BC, where you can hardly swing a Ramen noodle around without hitting people standing outside in a rain-peppered line-up waiting to squeeze into a steamy, cramped, Ramen House waiting to gorge on sumptuous broth and the delights therein bathed...but I digest. We went into SoSoBa on a Saturday just after 11am. We were told as we walked in to \"sit wherever we liked\" the place was empty but for one couple seated at the long picnic table on their patio. In my experience, the guests should be seated by a staff member who also puts down menus. We decided to join the people on the patio, menu-less. We were no sooner joined by about 25 really persistent flies. They remained with us for the duration; one of the cons of dining out of doors in downtown Phoenix, unfortunately.  Right away we got the feeling that our server was either really new at serving, or she was just having an off day. Once we sat down it took about 5 mins before she came out to take our drink order, despite the fact that we could see her inside doing random tasks like picking things up from one end of the room and setting them down somewhere else. Once she did finally come outside to take our drink order, we said we'd like to look at a menu first to see what's on offer.  We got the menus and picked out what looked yummy. They have a nice selection of shared plates, noodle bowls and salads, they offer vegan and  gluten-free options and adjustments too which is nice but no concern for us. We couldn't shake the idea that something about this place is off, it's got that \"new-restaurant-still-working-out-the-kinks\" feeling. Our neighbors' order was missing an ingredient. The said they were out of whatever it was. We were told that several items weren't available that day...that kind of stuff. We were joined by another couple at the long table, bring us to six.  We ordered two Mic Drop bowls with the grilled cauliflower to share. Our server offered to bring out the cauliflower first, we said sure, she also mentioned that the tofu was a great option to share if we were interested in a different veggie appy. We said next time. We're not vegetarian, we just like cauliflower. After about 10 min someone else appeared with an order of fried calamari and dropped it between us. When our server came out we said we ordered the Cauliflower, not the squid. She said \"oh..I thought you said calamari\" which was odd because she was the one who mentioned tofu as another veggie appy when we ordered. Perhaps she thinks calamari and cauliflower are both vegetables? Anyway, she took it back and went to order the correct item. The people next to us got their food: he had a noodle bowl and she ordered a gluten-free salad. The server came out a few mins later to inform the woman-half that though the salad was indeed glluten-free, they don't actually offer a gluten-free salad DRESSING \"So I brought you some lemon slices\". If you've ever had raw veggies with only lemon juice squirted on them you can imagine how underwhelming that taste experience can be, which probably explains why the woman barely ate any of her salad. She happened to be pregnant and likely starving. I imagined there would be a snack stop in their immediate future somewhere else. Our bowls arrived as described. I noticed that the portions seemed a tad small, but that might have been due to the fact that having had no appy yet I was starving. The other thing was that both of our soups were warm, not at all hot. No steam whatsoever. I figured they heated it up just enough and then put the soup into cold bowls. I like my soup HOT. Because we were starving we decided to suck it up as by this point it had been almost 30min since we sat down and we never did get the cauliflower. Our server again appeared and said something about some ingredient for the cauliflower was not available so they decided they weren't bringing any out, \"but would we like to eat the bowl of calamari from before instead?\" Um, you mean the one we sent back 10min ago? No thanks. I will say that the soup, albeit tepid, was tasty. However, we live about a 20min drive from this place and are closer to better Asian noodle dining experiences. Perhaps this is growing pains? Perhaps the late-night experience is better with better staff? More menu options available.? We'll never know.  Ironically they have stickers everywhere that claim \"People Hate us on Yelp!\" If only they knew how ironic those are. I think we will just go for Pho next time as we'd planned, and continue our quest to discover a real Ramen experience in the valley elsewhere. SoSoBa is, well, so-so. So not what we were hoping for.",

The food here is similarly priced, but of a much higher quality. The restaurant is smaller, but also doesn't have Kayne blasting so loudly that you can't talk to whoever you came with. The food was warm, cooked right, and very flavorful. As you can tell from some of the other reviews, the typical ASU hipsters (and their parents) from Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, etc, come here with a palate incapable of tasting any seasoning other than your basic salt and pepper. Maybe try In-n-Out instead?  I don't like to be such a hater, but I'm just telling it like it is.   We had fun doodling in the waitress' notebook--also, the drinks here are powerful!  Can't wait to return!",

Nice simple decor and love the music. They played jazz piano mixed over chill hip hop beats. Reminded me of music Nujabes produced. Anyway, on to the food!  I got The Mic Drop and my girlfriend ordered the Okinawa special for the week. As for my bowl, the sourness of the kimchi and the shredded pork overpowered the broth. It was very salty and i tend to like salty foods. The Okinawa had a nice seafood base for the broth but it was definitely overly salty as well. We always appreciate a soft boiled egg done right and it sure was! The noodles were average but got the job done. They are open late and I'd come here again if my other ramen spot nearby wasn't open.",

Sososba is as if a bunch of people with no prior noodle restaurant experience got together, watched a youtube video or two, and decided to open a ramen business. But its as if they skipped through the youtube video of how to make ramen and only wrote down the beginning and end instructions. The individual pieces in my bowl were okay, but the overall delivery made no sense. Especially at the price.   Anyone who wants good ramen or noodles should try elsewhere. I know its Phoenix, but you've got options. Nishikawa Ramen for example. If you're ever in the mood for ramen, and Sososba in Phoenix is your only option, just microwave some 25 cents ramen from Frys and save yourself some money. The quality will be the same.  The people and ambiance is nice though. But the food is not great, definitely not worth more than 3 star.s",

Yeah, I'm that person who uses the word \"vibe\" non-ironically, deal with it. Also I noticed after typing this that other people have used this word as well, so it fits.   We got a table with high top seating and looked at their menu. We ordered two appetizers: balls of fire (mac & cheese balls with hot sauce) and General Tso Tso cauliflower. The balls were okay, the hot sauce wasn't that hot and they were on the larger side so I split one. Absolutely loved the cauliflower, the flavors were perfect and I loved that sauce.   For my entree, I got the Mothra, which was a vegetarian noodle dish with broccoli, fried tofu, bok choy, peas (didn't see any), mint and basil in a green curry. I did not like it! It tasted like a combination of coconut (probably used coconut milk) and lemon, and was not good. I tried some of the ramen dishes, and they were fine. Two of us ordered the katsu ramen, and asked for no bacon, but they came with it. They took them back and got us new ones, hopefully. Our server was nice and made a joke when we asked about the tip suggestions on the receipt, which was funny.   I liked their hot sauce station, so many to choose from but I went with the classic, Sriracha. It was good of them to have veggie options since a lot of the dishes seemed to have red meat or pork. Pretty cool that they're open late being downtown.",

I can say that I REALLY enjoyed the cocktails and service and would absolutely come back for their amazing happy hour deals. It was essentially half off certain ramens and drinks until 6pm. Not sure what time it starts. Honestly the food was so-so but my expectations for ramen are really high so I'm willing to overlook it. If you can sit at the bar, have Christian or Chris help you out for the night. They make amazing cocktails and I loved how ginger was incorporated in so many of them. They were willing to substitute sesame gin for regular at no additional charge when I told them it wasn't really my thing. Overall great experience and assuming it's cooler outside for us to sit on the patio, my friends and I will be back.",

The broth of my ramen was really good, very rich flavors, the minced pork was cooked well, but the eggs were okay, just the usual boiled egg. My big problem with the ramen was the noodles. They were not cooked perfectly, because there was this whole bunch of noodles completely entangled and sticky. See the pictures.  Next, the Hostile Takeover was good as per my husband's comments.   The customer service was okay. Nothing so over the top. Just usual check in on if everything was okay. I really liked the vibe and the location of Sosoba. But the ramen not so much.

Cocktail list is fun too :) overall, cute place for a fun quick date.",

Sure, some restaurants might offer it among billions of other items on the menu but here, the main noodle bowls also include udon noodles.  I have had udon in Japan and California. And believe it not, udon bowls can get pretty creative. That's why SoSoBa didn't disappoint in the creative category.  I had the Mic Drop which was a nice combo of everything. The flavor was strong. The noodles were great, and the toppings were plenty. The bowl... for the price point, was a little small. I guess I can say it was California prices! I was hoping for bigger bowls but with all of the toppings, it's a toss up depending on hungry you are. I ate two bowls. Hahaha.  Overall, I say try it out because of the unique build of their noodle bowls with the toppings and the flavor. A lot of quality Japanese noodle places have popped up, and things are starting to taste the same, so come here for variety. Come here for udon!",

Can only order 3 of the same buns. I ordered the bulgogi, which was really dried out been with no flavor.  Also ordered the Ball of Fire, a mac and cheese ball deep fried and injected with hot sauce.  The mac and cheese was creamy, but didnt taste the hot sauce.  I would not recommend this place based on service and high prices. No one came by again until they brought the bill.",

But I think they know it- the restaurant displays stickers that say \"People HATE us on Yelp\", and though I initially thought this was meant to be ironic, I would soon find out the truth. The decor is Asian eclectic, and it's endearing. There's a cart full of hot sauces for what I imagine is DIY spicing for restaurant-goers, and hilarious posters of Godzilla and Kim Jong Il as a baby on a dog (or what I interpret as Kim Jong Il). The bar stools are a deep red with large cushions for big butts, which I appreciate!, and they have a pretty decent happy hour from 3-6.  We ordered drinks, the Ball of Fire, the Tso Tso Cauliflower, and the Mic Drop. The Ball of Fire was a mac n' cheese ball breaded with a dollop of sriracha on it; it tasted completely bland and unappetizing. The Tso Tso Cauliflower tasted just as it sounds, and had the very familiar taste of General Tso's from a fast food Chinese restaurant at the mall. Finally, the Mic Drop had a lot of things going on, including Ham Fries (ham cut in long strips) and pork rinds, and it felt like someone must have had the munchies when they conjured up the recipe. Unfortunately, the bowl was just too overwhelming and mediocre at best: it was sodium in a bowl, but not the good kind. The highlight of the entire experience was my Mai Tai, which tasted beautifully, and the bartender was very nice, but this is a restaurant, not just a bar. All in all, our bill came out to less than $30, not terrible for the Roosevelt Arts District, but for \"SoSo\" food, so disappointing that we will not return.",

I ordered the Hostile takeover bowl, very bland and very little broth. Also, the lack of 1/2 off happy hour like the flagstaff location makes the  food that much worse. I love this store and want to see it thrive but there are some major things to be addressed before I would call this an equal to the flagstaff location. Also the website is horrible to navigate, has no menu and wrong number for Phoenix location.",

Easily the best ramen I have been able to find in Phoenix hands down! The spice level was on point, the noodles were perfect! The only disappointing this is that they don't do the soy egg anymore but regardless the egg was perfect! I totally recommend adding pork belly to the bowl. It's crispy and the fat was rendered perfectly on the top. The Mac and cheese balls with the \"fire\" sauce were stupid good and I totally recomendable them, super crispy exterior but creamy interior and the pasta inside still had a bite to it. The kimchi is to die for and totally almost ordered 2 more sides just to take them home to have extra in my fridge. If you want to have the best ramen in the valley but feel like your eating at your closest friends house enjoying a meal with chill company this is totally the place for you. I will probably be back on a weekly basis! Thank you SoSoBa staff",

It's located exactly in downtown Phoenix, central and Roosevelt. When you go in you either seat yourself or a host helps you either one depending on how busy it is. When you walk inside the ambience is very Asian fusion and very modern with its lowlights and dark reds palette, energy of the feng shui is good.  The restaurant is fairly new so I Understand. I sat at the bar and I exactly knew what I wanted. Sosoba specializes in specialty ramen and has a house made broth. They can also adjust any recipe for your dietary needs like vegan options and vegetarian options. Everything on the menu looks absolutely delicious, if you are willing to spend menu try one of the appetizers but if you just want ramen definitely recommend that, I ordered the Mic Drop which is 12 dollars and very worth all of your coins. Udon Noodles, Pork Belly, Carnitas, Chicharon, Ham Fries, Soft Boiled Egg, House Made Kimchi, scallions and bacon in tontakatsu 15-h broth. Well if y'all feeling soupy and noodl-ey come by to sosoba! Stay hungry phoenix .",

The decor and everything in here was Mediocre. Nothing fancy nor an eye catcher for me.   The fire ball Mac and cheese was good. But it threw me off to have it at a ramen restaurant.   The mic drop - has prom belly in it. He said it was good.   I ordered the vegetarian, Mr. Karl Katsu. I eliminated the chicken, bacon and carrots. (I don't really care for carrots) but he did add broccoli for me since they didn't have tofu at the moment. He was very apologetic and sincere that they just open and they don't have a lot of items.  My egg was super salty. I didn't eat that. The ramen was decent. Edible. The corn was crunchy and it went well with my soup. flavorful and colorful. I wish it was more temperature hot though. And my broccoli to be cooked please.   It's wasn't anything for me to brag about. I'll come back when it's couple weeks in when they're all set and have everything ready.",

Really cute little easterly. The cauliflower was awesome, my mom is vegetarian and she really enjoyed it! The balls of Fire was FIRE- reminded me of the fried Mac n cheese from cheesecake. My favorite fatty food is mac n cheese so I really like it.   I had the Mic Drop- I thought the flavors worked really well together. The udon noodles were perfectly cooked and the egg was nice and gooey (my fav part). Although I do wish they put the whole egg In there. My mom got Mr Katsu without meat & bacon- she's vegetarian. She didn't really like that but I feel like unless a restaurant is specialized in vegetarian/vegan food- she won't find it good. She's also traditional Asian lady and very judgmental of Asian cuisine lol.   Definitely can't wait to come back for the full menu. Hoping they have a spicy ramen/noodle dish since I love spicy food lol.",

My water cup was never less than half full. Love that!  I got The Mic Drop. A wonderful dish with a myriad of flavors and textures, all layered over soft udon noodles. The meats were delicious and the kimchi offered a welcome brightness to cut through the fatty broth. I loved this dish and would certainly get it again.   Please do stop by Sosoba for a bowl. No substitutions are necessary; just cozy in and enjoy a nice serving of ramen.",

When I order tonkotsu I want a thick creamy brown/tan broth that has truly been cooked for 15-24 hours.  Still the ambiance was very mellow. The staff were nothing short of excellent. The music was on point. If only the ramen was any good I am sure I would be back.",

I really wanted a good ramen place downtown but I guess that's not going to be the case. I would recommend using fresh ingredients and go for flavor. It's ramen go big or go home. I don't understand how other people are saying their ramen was good. Is this your first time eating ramen? If so please do not comment.

They are a Ramen house but today special as a bowl of poke, with a lot of extras.  They can make most dishes vegan.  I could eat there three days a week, and probably will.  They have a great bar and a bunch of great draft beers.  If you are working they have Wi-Fi.",

I'm not saying the food was bad, it was actually good but just not as good as other ramen. The matcha tea was super on point and I loved the idea of the chili bar (all types of hot sauce on a rolling bar cart). It's a great alternative if other places are closed, because Sosaba stays open till 2am! Which is awesome for us late night owls.",

I could probably overlooked poor customer service if I got great food. Not the case here, food looked delicious but very bland. Shishito peppers app was probably the best meal amongst others (dump truck salad, mic drop udon noodle, and Mr. Katsu ramen noodle). The dump truck salad was looking and tasting different than in Falgstaff. Both the udon and ramen soup broths were bland tasted like water. The ramen noodle was a bit underdone and hard boiled egg white had a weird consistency, almost like melt in your mouth bad. Would NOT be back here again, but most definitely will be back to Sosoba in Flagstaff.",

We sent it back and ended up going somewhere else for ramen. But if you want a really good glass of ice water, this is the place to go. Lol! But for reals they had really good ice water. No funny tap water taste. Sweet chili calamari was delish, spicy macaroni and cheese ball was not spicy at all. Only spicy part would be the little squirt of sriracha sauce that's on it. Pork and kimchi tostada was good. Ramen was bland and awful.",

We started with a Mai Tai (a bit in the sweet side but unique and delicious), and a Coin Toss Sidecar, Orange. As an appetizer, we got the Sweet Chili Calamari. This is definitely not generic calamari. It was fried perfectly tender and the hint of glaze was super yummy. Our mains were two noodle bowls: the Mic Drop and the Tantanmen.  I am a big spicy ramen fan, so Tantanmen was perfect for me. The noodles were perfect and the broth, although modest in proportion, was super flavorful. I wasn't a huge fan of the kale, but the soft-boiled egg, ground pork, bamboo shoots and green onions made up for it.  My husband's Mic Drop with thick udon noodles was much milder and a pork lover's dream: pork rind, pork belly, bacon, you name it.  As Emeril would say, happy happy!  The service at the bar was excellent and quick. We will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "There is a growing trend amongst hipster eateries that believes that the spicier that the food is, the better that it tastes.  SoSoBa, subscribes to this philosophy, big time.  My rule of thumb is that any restaurant that has to overpower the taste of their food by making it so spicy, is hiding poor cooking or ingredients so that you won't notice. Hereto, SoSoBa is guilty.   Spice should be used to ENHANCE the flavor of delicious food, not overpower it.  Their menu fails to indicate levels of spiciness or even mention that the item you are ordering may be spicy.  We ordered an appetizer (pork wings). The meat was tender and delicious and served on a bed of crispy noodles with a sauce and some sort of fine red thread-like substance. The sauce was mildly spicy and complimented the dish, however, it looked like someone spilled the jar of chili powder onto the crispy noodles.  The taste was overpowering and left your lips stinging from the heat.  The waitstaff seemed indifferent to complaint of over spiced appetizer and tried to explain it away instead of apologizing.  The menu had a poor variety of of main dishes and a repetitive use of pork belly throughout the entire menu. This is a clear indication that the chef is either  uncreative or is unable to work outside their comfort zone.  Their kitchen was EXTREMELY unprepared, they RAN OUT of a MAIN INGREDIENT (Udon Noodle) early on a Saturday evening. For a restaurant that claims to specialize in noodles, this is a faux pas.  The kitchen also took far too long to prepare our meals. This is either an indication of a poorly run kitchen, or I suspect an indication that this restaurant is trying to upsell their clients more drinks...a dubious practice.   Even though I expressed concern to the waitstaff about not wanting my meal to be too spicy and despite my earlier complaint about the overspiciness of our appetizer, I was delivered a bowl of food that was also high in the heat index.   This solidified my opinion that either the chef prefers to serve food the way they want to cook it or that the waitstaff was incompetent.  The final kicker that proves that this restaurant does not have your best interest at heart was the gratuity ledger on the bill that gave you 3 suggested tips:  18% = $9.36 20% = $10.40 84.20% = $43.78  Really...84.20%?  Either this is meant to be a joke, or more likely they hope that you are too drunk from all those extra drinks you bought waiting for thier unprepared, over spiced, and uncreative, food to arrive to notice the amount.   Overall a complete failure, would not recommend.",

Everyone at the table raved about it. I got the Sweet Chile Glazed Udon for myself & while it was tasty, it seemed a little confused. I'd like to disclaim though, I tend to be a bit pickier when it comes to Asian Fusion dishes, being as I'm Korean & I think my standards for Asian food are a little different.

I always crave the traditional Japanese ramen, with pork broth that tastes like it was prepared for hours and hours. With that being said, I unfortunately was not a fan of SoSoBa. It's not that it was bad. It just wasn't my kind of ramen. I ordered the Mic Drop and it had too much going on, too many toppings with little broth - broth that wasn't great either. It was far, far from traditional Japanese ramen. My boyfriend had the sweet chili glazed udon which he thought was good. I thought it was better than the Mic Drop for sure. I'd love to come back and try other things on the menu. The calamari, balls of fire and kim chi look like it would taste pretty good!",

After perusing the menu, The Mic Drop was calling my name. Of course by this point, I was pretty inebriated and didn't realize the dish came with  udon noodles instead of ramen. Good thing the waitress pointed it out and I immediately switched to ramen noodles.  10 minutes later, the 'not-piping' hot bowl of ramen arrives. The first thing I devour is the chicharon (fried pork rinds) that was soaking up the tonkotsu broth. One bite, and so far so good. In about 5 minutes, the contents in the bowl were gone.  Overall, the noodles tasted good cause I was drunk and the place is open until 2 am. However, in retrospect, I think if I was sober, it would only be 'ok.'",

He was very patient with handling all 9 of our orders and answering our questions.   [ENVIRONMENT: 4] The place is medium sized and very clean. However the lighting is pretty dim. Bathrooms are also very clean and the trashcan is automatic!  [PRODUCT: 2] We ordered balls of fire (fried Mac n cheese balls with Sriracha - $1 during happy hour, $3 per ball regular) and tantaimen ($12). The mac n cheese inside the balls were very plain and lacking any real cheese flavor. The only good part about them were the breading and the spice from sriracha. The tantaimen had a lot of good sides and vegetables in the soup, however the noodles were very hard and clumped together. They seemed very undercooked, but the waiter did offer to remake the dish.  [OVERALL: 3] I came here on vacation as I am originally from California so in comparison to the ramen there, this place does not come close. It was a good experience but I would not come back here nor recommend it, at least not the noodle soup dishes.",

    "text": "At long last, SoSoBa is open for the business.  It was a lengthy wait after Centurion closed their doors at this location before Flagstaff's most popular noodle spot opened their second location here in Downtown Phoenix.  But now they're here.  So after a long work week, I made the short walk from my apartment to this spot during Friday happy hour.  If you've been to 2nd Ave and Roosevelt in the space that used to be Centurion, the exterior hasn't changed all that much.  The patio outside has some bar and picnic seating, but otherwise the exterior is the relatively unchanged.  The interior however is almost unrecognizable from what it used to be (and in this case, that's a good thing).  They've blown out part of the wall that used to separate the front bar area from the rest of the restaurant and have managed to create a pretty spacious sit down area throughout the restaurant with about double the seating of Centurion.  The lighting, the colors, and furniture are also a huge improvement.  Its quite a startling change as I never knew this space was so big.  Anyways, let's get to the good stuff.  I have not had the pleasure of visiting SoSoBa's flagship location in Flagstaff so I did a little research before making my way here.  From what I read, it appeared the Mic Drop is the bowl that put SoSoBa on the map.  And it reads like a pork all-star team.  Pork Belly, Carnitas, chicharron, bacon, and ham fries in a slow cooked pork broth.  To boot, there's a soft boiled egg, kim chi and scallions.  Oh and some nice, soft thick cut udon noodles.  Took a little over 5 minutes for them to make.  I'll admit, this thing was pretty intimidating when it arrived at my table.  The bowl is huge and I didn't think I stood a chance.  But once I put the first helping of it in my mouth, there was no stopping me.  The broth was out of this world.  And the combination of different types of pork was fantastic.  Admittedly my chopsticks game could use some work as it took me a bit to get some of that deliciousness in bulk.  So by all means make sure your chopsticks skills are on point for this.  Super psyched from a delicious bowl of noodles and pork, I decided I've give dessert a go here as well.  So far there's only two dessert items on the menu.  A miso carrot cake and a grasshopper cheesecake.  I'm a sucker for cheesecake and something cold and dense like cheesecake sounded perfect after a warm spicy noodle bowl.  The specs on this cheesecake incarnation:  A green tea and mint semi-freddo cheesecake with Oreo crumble and cocoa nibs.  The presentation was a bit surprising in that it was served almost like a sushi roll would be served.  As for the taste?  Slight disappointment on this one.  The flavor was very light and almost herbal which was surprising, but not altogether a bad thing.  But it didn't have the cold density that my mouth was craving so that was a bit of let down.  The texture was almost more of a custard than a cheesecake.  It wasn't terrible, just a bit of departure from what I'd expected and hoped for.  Despite a somewhat subpar dessert, I left SoSoBa nevertheless impressed.  Total cost for my meal including tax and tip came to about $25.  The staff was super friendly and they also encourage you to leave a note in the little customer notebook that comes with your check.  So all in all a great successor to Centurion at this prime spot on Roosevelt.  They've done some amazing work with the interior and have given Roosevelt Row its first True ramen spot.  So if you've got a hankering for noodles and a readiness to bring your chopsticks A game, SoSoBa might be right up your alley.",

I was very surprised to find that this restaurant is only rated 3 and a half stars. It definitely needs to be a five star! I totally recommended this place for when you want to try something different.",

    "text": "Wow where do I start. I'll have to go with our server Christian. Absolutely spectacular. I have not seen any individual in my two years in the valley demonstrate such perfect customer service. He went above and beyond to meet our requests with a smile. I also witnessed him be a genuine good soul to a seemingly distraught/homeless man who came in for water. He did me an awesome favor of holding the last bottle of my favorite beer for my next visit too!   To go on.... the atmosphere was great for the date night I was on with my wife and it seemed like a good bar location too for a cocktail with friends. Outdoor seating looked inviting as well.   The food was delicious. We ordered the cauliflower and peppers and they both exceeded expectations. For entrees I got the cold soba salad which was awesome and my wife got the SUV meal which was good but could've used a little more flavor. It smelled divine though!!   Overall we will definitely be visiting again and bringing friends next time. Thanks for a great experience!",

The food was pretty good- large servings of ramen, pretty tasty, lots of noodles, and no skimping on toppings, though I have to admit my noodles were a bit overcooked and soggy. My friend's noodles were fine, so maybe I just got unlucky there.   FYI- there's a vegan option for those interested, and it's pretty tasty too.",
