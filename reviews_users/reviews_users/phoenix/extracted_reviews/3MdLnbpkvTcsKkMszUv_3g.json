It's so nice to see that more and more good quality, authentic Asian restaurants are popping up all around us lately.  They had their BUY ONE GET ONE HALF OFF deal going at the time, which was great! Not sure if it's still going, but having that deal would've been the only realistic way for us to able to become frequent customers. I don't think their full price is necessarily unfair (we haven't been to another poke bowl place to compare, and we know sushi grade fish isn't the cheapest), but it's definitely a great place to eat every once in a while on those days when we want to splurge.",

The service was very good, with friendly, talkative, and accommodating employees. Clean interior  Cons: Unfortunately, it is way overpriced. The amount of actual fish in that they give is kind of a joke. Some of the veggies taste a little off as well.

Wasn't impressed by topping options, wish the cucumber salad had looked more appetizing but I already had cucumbers added so I opted out.  I won't be back as I prefer ahipoki more overall.

My friend who tagged along described it as \"subway/chipotle for fish bowls.\" Alright, seems pretty accurate to me. That is what it is, afterall.   So this is a nice little quiet place that recently opened up. I have never tried one of these in Arizona, so I tried it. It was really good. I ordered a regular sized bowl, which means they give you two (2) scoops of fish/X-protien-source. I got a base of spring mix (salad). But there was white rice, brown rice and these crispy strips available too. Then you get your two scoops of protein; I got a scoop of tuna and a scoop of salmon. Then you choose your toppings. I got cucumber, red onion, edamame, dried seaweed, ginger, mango and sesame seed topped off with their spicy house sauce.   Overall, the food was good. The restaurant was clean. The location is quiet and convenient. Good first impression to me.",

This place is better as you can get other yummy foods.  Plus Poke bowl in Tempe has been out of TUNA twice when I was planning to eat there.  Which...is WHY you go there.  That is like starbucks running out of coffee??!!!  Poke Bowl lost me a customer and Pokedon is my new drug of choice!",

    "text": "Wow! Really great poke place! I ordered \"to-go\" and if you go through yelp, it's really easy to order your poke bowl through the app! However I called to do my order just in case and the customer service is awesome!!!! The guy on the phone was totally cool with all my intricate order specifics for each of my poke bowls! I even asked to try out all the sauces on the side, and when I picked it up, they were all labeled nicely for us to pick and choose!  The poke was delicious! Great portions! Everything tasted fresh and the presentation is great! It looks really cute to take pictures of and it's assembled very neatly which I love!!!!   But they not only have poke bowls. My friend got the gyodan bowl and it was awesome!!!! It's a flavorful beef with egg and carmelized onions! It kinda reminds me of a Hawaiian loco-moco but I will definitely get this for myself for next time!  Pokedon definitely outshines it's competition. Compared to such a place like Ahipoki which is a large Cali-chain, the poke is delicious! The presentation is great and looks very neat and clean! The restaurant itself is very clean and modern looking! And the customer service was a great experience. So 5 STARS to Pokedon!  Tips for ordering poke 1) you DONT need a large bowl. Their portions are pretty much the same. If you want to have a bigger bowl, ask for extra of the sides! Ask for extra rice, ask for more edamame, etc etc 2) if you're unsure of the sauces, ask for them on the side! It's kinda fun to try them all 3) if you ask for wasabi, ask for it on the sauce! The worst thing is to bite into a huge chunk of wasabi. I usually put it in a cup, mix it with soy sauce or one of their sauces, and pour accordingly  Can't wait to come here again!",

I've seen it every time I've been to Pokinutrition in Chandler and thought I would give it a try. Pokedon does however offer a wonton chips bowl which I haven't seen in any other poke restaurant. My favorite toppings are the seaweed salad, edamame, and masiago. The yuzu dressing goes really great with the salmon. So, all in all, if you're looking for a fresh and presumably healthy option without trading taste for value, this is the place for you. Check it out!",

I've been pretty loyal to AhiPoke Bowl, but after visiting Pokedon, I think that's going to change!   First of all, it's not as expensive as the other places, and it's just as good. They don't even charge extra for yellowtail! They also have wonton chips as a base option, which I haven't seen anywhere else. I had a half/half of white rice wonton chips, and then I had the salmon and spicy scallops, crab, cucumbers, onions, roe, green onions, pickled radishes, and sesame seeds. It all tasted so fresh!

    "text": "Let me preface by saying I've been to Hawaii several times.  It's one of my favorite vacation spots.  And every time I go, no matter which island, I want to have some poke at least once (usually more than that).  Poke is everywhere there.  You can get it in the grocery store deli case, there are little restaurants that serve it, etc.  Great stuff.  So I was excited to see a poke place locally at 4.5 stars!  We had the opportunity this afternoon since we were in the area, and so we stopped-in.  I'll cut to the chase and say I was disappointed.  First the positives.   The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The sashimi appeared to be fresh (given that we're about 400 miles from the nearest ocean), as did the other ingredients.  You have a few different ways you can get your sashimi (on rice, greens, and with various other add-ons like cucumber and roe, etc).  And they had other options besides the sashimi.  Now the negatives.   They offer the poke in a rice-bowl format though you do have the option for \"greens\".  So they put the cold sashimi on hot rice.  This makes warm sashimi.  I've never been anyplace that served warm sashimi, from Asia to here.  No one.  And I understand why now, because it seems to trigger something in your taste saying \"this isn't right\".  Warm raw fish could be hazardous to your health, and I think the brain instinctively knows that.  Now I have no doubt this was flown-in fresh and kept refrigerated right up until they put it on my hot rice.  I'm sure it's safe.  My brain knows this.  But the taste buds are saying \"huh?!\".  My wife had it on greens, and did not experience this.  So if you like greens you should probably get the sashimi on the greens ONLY.  Next, notice how I'm calling it \"sashimi\".  Because that's what it was.  It was NOT poke.  Go anywhere in Hawaii and ask for poke, and you get chunks of tuna (usually) that have been marinated in sauce with sesame seeds and julienned onions and maybe some other stuff (seaweed, etc).  Marinated!!  I would guess for a few hours at the minimum.  The sashimi here was not marinated.  They put the sauce on 60 seconds before they give it to you.  It does not penetrate the fish at all.  It doesn't infuse at all.  In fact, it mostly goes down and wets your rice with the sauce (and flavor).  The tuna sits on top with almost none of the flavor.  (Also note that their house sauce is what the poke sauce is supposed to be; I've never had poke before that used the other sauces they offer, and I know this because they were nice enough to let me taste them first...only the house sauce is correct).  If you're thinking \"well just get some rice in the bite with the tuna\", then here's the problem:  the rice soaks up the sauce pretty efficiently.  So the flavor is actually too strong that way and you miss-out on the flavor of the fish..  If you get yours on greens you won't have the soaking-up problem, but the fish is still on top and not pulling much flavor from the sauce which falls to the bottom, so all you taste is fish (and greens).  This is what my wife described to me from her fish, though she did like the other \"stuff\" (she got the cucumber and pineapple and other things, and had basically made it a salad with sashimi in it).  In Hawaii the only flavor from the sauce that you get is that which has soaked into the fish and wet the outside of it during the marination.  It's not a lot, but it's enough to give it a wonderful delicate flavor that does not overpower.  It is not served on rice there, it's just served straight-up.  So you don't get either the heating I mentioned nor the no-sauce fish, nor the extra strong sauce flavor from the soaked rice.  I'm not sure why they do it differently here, but I don't think it works for all the reasons I just explained.  They are a bit expensive.  Really $$ if you get the large poke (the small isn't really much fish).  But I expected that since you can't get fresh raw fish in the desert without flying it in.  I did not try their other offerings, but I won't be getting their sashimi again.  Unless they start marinating the fish properly ahead of time to infuse the flavor. I most definitely have \"experienced better\", and was tempted to go with two stars, but my wife liked hers a little better plus the staff was really nice, so I'll bump it to three.",

So, here's a few stellar things offered at Pokedon: - Menu items other than poke, literally on their menu as \"Not Poke\" (my boyfriend was pumped to order a noodle dish, since he wasn't in theood for poke). - Fruit (pineapple) to add to your poke. OMG. Amazing.  - Fresh jalapeno slices. Yummmmm.  - Garlic ponzu sauce. Need I say more? - Samples of the sauces (before you commit) - Miso with tofu. Yessssssss!!   A suggestion I'd like to see (just one lol): - A sweet sauce of some sort (Ahi Poki Bowl has a sweet citrus that immediately comes to mind)  Also 5/5 - the service here was great. The girl who made my poke was super nice and accommodating! I can't remember your name, but thank you!!   A note on the noodle dish: my boyfriend reported that it was good, 4 out of 5.  See you soon, Pokedon",

    "text": "Best poke place so far we found in Arizona. It seems that having a poke place in the continent is becoming a more of a trend style. Poke originated from our Hawaiian islands as a appetizer, to sit around under the sunset and enjoy what you have caught from the ocean... I appreciate the continent wanting to share our culture it is part of our staple dishes and has been around for many many years in our islands.  The cubes of the different varieties of poke fish they offer, yes it's small cubes compare to what we have back at home. We have bigger cubes to offer but, we are not at home and I am happy to have some kind of freshness of what they offer is what makes up for it and the variety of sauces that compliments each dish of poke, it's amazingly good! However, the mango on your poke, I have never had that before with my poke bowls but, it was very sweet and refreshing to have it on the SIDE as a small desert  I love how the new concept offers so many to either be placed on your hot rice or mixed green salads. You have so much to choose from to customize it the way that you want, which is a new for me to indulge and open my mind to try something new.  The owners are very nice and pleasant and will go out of their way to make sure you do get what you want in a brand new restaurant!  We came here twice in one day! Once when we saw the sign as we were passing by saying \"Pokedon\" and 2nd when my son came home from a ski trip he wanted to also taste their spicy ahi poke. It's not the same as back home but, even he said \"it's still good and close to that satisfying taste he longs for when we are away from Hawaii!\" Again, the spicy mayo sauce is delicious...  I've had both today - Salmon/Spicy scallops on mixed greens with spicy mayo, I can literally just live off of this and tonight, for dinner I had the same fish/scallops over hot rice with all my fixing and I left feeling full, content and happy!  My husband being he cannot eat carbs at this moment had (2) delicious meals of teriyaki chicken over mixed salad with spicy mayo and teriyaki beef with the same mixtures he ate both of his plate lunch in one sitting.. hahaha! He must of been super hungry!  I'm sooo happy it's right down the street from us where we can pop in... next time I'm just gonna order the poke mixing and nothing else and eat it with my poi! Can't wait to try that! Yummy...",

What makes this place a 5 star for me is the service, the moment I went in they asked if I been here before or needed help. While getting my bowl built they offered me extra rice which I appreciate, as other places usually don't take the initiative to offer. All in all best poke place I been too, would recommend because of the service.",

    "text": "Went in on a Friday night after seeing some pretty positive Yelp reviews and wanting to try a new place. Learned that this location has only been open about 7 months. (Not a bad thing). We always like to try new places and were excited to see that it was pretty close to home.   I do like that they give you the option for wonton chips here. I got half rice/half chips. They also have the usual fish options, but I did notice that they were not as cold as some of the other places we have tried. They have a good variety of sauces, and the toppings are all included in the price.   I did check out their website, It is a bit confusing to maneuver through it and you have to scroll down a bit to see their menu.   Employees were friendly, and attentive even letting us sample some of the sauces before we committed to them, which was very nice.   Place itself is clean, and well maintained, Employees were cleaning through out the time we were there, when there was no people in line ordering.   We will probably be back since it is so close to home, and we did enjoy the food. Only complaint is the large portion did not fill up my hubby and was slightly on the smaller side. Like I said, I ordered half and half and it seemed like I had more food than he did.",

But Pokedon is great because they have several cooked meat options (chicken, (spicy) crab, shrimp) so we were more excited to try the food. (Obviously other Poke places might have cooked options I'm just not sure haha).   I shared a regular poke bowl with my mom and was pretty filled even though we got the spring mix rather than rice! It felt refreshing to eat especially in this heat and I thought there was a good amount of meat to last the whole dish.   Overall, I enjoyed my first poke experience. Nice servers, clean environment, and great food. Definitely would recommend!",

Due to this difference I am happily willing to pay for that extra avocado. Yellowtail is my favorite and it is offered at the same price as every other protein option which I find shockingly pleasant. The sauce options are to my liking. Their house spicy is delicious, not too salty or sweet. The seaweed salad is a refreshing add. They also have a number of other toppings like cucumber, onion and jalepeno. The seasonal fresh fruit, edamame, seaweed, furikake and crispy onion are among the number of dry options that can be added.  Not only is the food delicious and plentiful but the service is so friendly and informative. The free miso soup with the yelp check in is a great way to wash down the flavor without being too overbearing. I hope they keep up the good work because I have been coming on a weekly basis and they are relatively consistent. It's worth the extra drive for me and it's great for students near campus. I love how the servers come up and make conversation to make sure everything is to your liking. Please bring your business here! I have been spoiled by their generosity and flavorful sauces and I would like everyone to experience the same warm welcome.",

The regular bowl (half spring mix and half brown rice) was very filling- couldn't even finish the rice! Each ingredient was perfect: the avocado was super ripe without any brown spots, the tuna was beautifully cut, and each topping contributed a special texture and flavor that will make your own creation unique! The sauces are amazing!! I mixed ponzu with Spicy mayo and was not disappointed.   Overall, my husband and I can't wait to go back to try more fresh offerings. The owner/manager Jennifer made us feel very welcome and even helped us understand the pairing of sauces with certain fish! Looking forward to our second taste!  Thanks so much, Pokedon!  Update: I am on their mailing list and received a complimentary avocado add on. I went in to redeem and was pleasantly surprised to find that the avocado was literally sliced fresh - see photo! I'm so tired of other restaurants using avocado mash that's been treated with citrus or preservatives- that really changes the flavor! Well not at Pokedon, they do it right!!!",

I had the salmon and spicy scallops! Both had a good texture and were a good temperature! Of course the spicy scallop isn't going to stay entirely cold after being on hot rice but it was still good regardless! The spicy scallops are marinated in a spicy mayo sauce that was light and flavorful!  All of the sauces have good flavor! Try the garlic ponzu with some yuzu and a little spicy mayo! The garlic ponzu has a nice kick and is slightly spicy! The yuzu has a citrus taste and is tangy and subtly sweet. Super amazing! Spicy mayo is generally very creamy so it's best when mixed with another sauce! It adds a nice creamy note to the flavor profile!   The service is also so great! Everyone is friendly and they help you through the process all the way instead of passing you to the next person for each step! The owners are so sweet! They really care about their customers' experience!  I'll be back for sure! Definitely hooked!",

During their soft opening special (ends Sunday, Feb. 19th), all regular bowls were $6! Pair it with your Yelp check-in offer to upgrade to a combo, which comes with miso soup and a drink, for free. Excellent deals!  Loving: Mangoes, jalapenos, yuzu vinaigrette, oh my! That yuzu pairs very nicely with the mangoes and jalapenos. It's Arizona meets Hawaii. What a duo! I also like how yellowtail doesn't cost extra here. The sauces here in general are all pretty flavorful. They also serve some hot foods if you don't want poke.  Not Loving: Portion sizes. I'm not big eater but their regular left me wanting more. The price point is a little lower though. When comparing them with their east valley competitor, which we'll call \"AP,\" their crab salad and seaweed salad is also pretty vanilla compared to AP. The fish is also cut smaller which sauce-lovers will rejoice.  Overall, I wouldn't mind stopping in if I was in the area. It's clean, the staff is super friendly, and the eats are decent.",

    "text": "Pokedon is a brand new poke bowl restaurant in Tempe! I was excited to see the sign go up a few weeks ago so when I drove by today and saw the open sign I knew I had to try it out! The menu is similar to Ahipoki Bowl but I think they offer a better deal here since they do not charge extra for yellowtail.  The soft opening special was a great deal, $6 for a regular bowl which includes two scoops of your choice of seafood with a plethora of toppings. For your base, they offer white rice, brown rice, wonton strips, or salad, with a choice to have half and half in your bowl if you'd like. Choices for seafood include tuna, salmon, scallops, shrimp, octopus, and yellowtail.   I decided on a regular bowl with salmon, yellowtail, with a half salad half brown rice base. I had it with the ponzu sauce and overloaded on the toppings (Jalapeno, crab salad, edamame, cucumber, pickled cucumber, red onion, pickled cucumber, picked radish, masago, seaweed strips, sesame seeds, mango, wasabi, green onion and fried onion). They were very generous with the toppings and I loved the freshness of the seafood and mix ins, combination of flavors and the kaleidoscope of colors in my bowl. I especially enjoyed the fresh mango pieces with my bowl.   If you get the combo it's an extra $2.50 and includes a drink and miso soup. The soda fountain has iced tea and Coke products. The miso soup was pretty basic and had a light taste.  This seems like a more independent, family-run business than Ahipoki and service was so friendly and sweet. We even got a free sample of some delicious fried gyoza!   I go to the Smart and Final in the same plaza quite a lot so I foresee being one of their regular customers. Thanks Pokedon, for a great experience!",

I went with the garlic ponzu and yuzu sauce that they recommended, and it was a great citrus-y sauce to go with the raw fish. I got shrimp and octopus on mine, and it was delicious. I don't often see octopus as an option, so I loved that.  Service was great, and to top it all off, they had a promotion for a free thai tea if you're following their social media.   Will definitely go back when I'm in Tempe!",

The service is top-notch; Alison explained all the sauces but went the extra step to have is try the top 3 we were considering- and it made all the difference. She also took extra time to explain the other toppings we hadn't tried before. The portions are perfect. We both had the large bowl (3 proteins- highly recommend spicy scallops) for around $11 each. With two bowls, a soda and tip, we left for about $28. They offer non-carb friendly option of spring mix, or you can mix with white or brown rice or wonton chips. If you're not as hungry, a smaller bowl is available with 2 scoops protein for $8. Enjoy!",

Here is why:  The sushi is the most fresh. it is never ever low quality. they have the the best rice it is definitely the same rice you'd get when eating sushi. many other places have regular long grain and it just isn't sticky and ruins the entire meal. and they have great customer service there. I work in tempe and was trying to venture out because Pokedon is a bit further than i'd like to drive. but it is totally worth it. they have mastered the poke bowl. i'd love a location in the east valley or possible uber eats delivery. your food is top notch. The rest of the poke places truly don't compare. This is between the Tempe, Chandler, Mesa area.",

The poke trend hasn't really hit Tucson yet, but this place seems unique in that there are plenty of hot foods on the menu as well which is great!

Better wasabi, larger portions, smaller price, better seaweed salad, higher quality fish, more options, etc. The staff is really friendly and they even encourage you to try the sauces before you chose one.

The toppings were fresh, light, and delicious. Nice selection of fish which was also fresh and tasty. We ordered poke bowls and tempura shrimp. The tempura was so light it reminded me of what upscale Japanese restaurants serve.  I would come back to this place again and again.",

They are also different because they actually offer wonton chips as a base which totally adds that excellent crunch to go with the poke. Fish is always fresh and cold. Service is always kind and speedy. Plus there's tonssss of topping and sauce options available! Love it here!",

It was also apparent that they try to skimp you when serving you, they are very careful with their scoops.   If they want return customers they need to get their portions right. The amount of money they will save by skimping on portions wont matter when they can't stay in business. If the portion sizes would have been bigger I would have already returned more than once.   Their local competitor is opening down the street, their portions are great, please learn from your competition!!

I didnt get  as much crab as other places and wish there were more toppings to choose. All the chopsticks were very splintered so be cautious with those. The miso soup was really good.",

It was delicious and the fish tasted relatively fresh. What I really liked about Pokedon more about other places is that one of their toppings is a seasonal fruit, sometimes mango and sometimes pineapple. They had pineapple when I went and that bit of sweetness in my bowl was perfection! Staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of the selection. Sample before you order if you aren't familiar with their ingredients! :)",

    "text": "(Lyrics - Tears For Fears - Break It Down Again)  Pokedon again So those are my base  And these are my toppings Add spice like a man Proteins like with Shrimp  When it's all mixed up Better bite it down Oo, oo. Oo, oo  Not getting enough poke in your diet!?  Pokedon is one of the few Poke Bowl restaurants popping up all around the valley.  It's pretty much a 2017 phenomenon that's swept across the valley and indeed we love it!  Pokedon offers a fresh and modern atmosphere with tv screens hanging from the ceiling walls giving it a sports bar atmosphere.  What I really appreciate about Pokedon is that they don't just offer Poke bowls, but also teriyaki dishes and sides like miso soup and noodles.  I wouldn't know why you would come to a poke place and not order poke, but I gather everyone has that one friend .... yeah I'm talking about you Guy!    Moving on, I started my Poke bowl with the usual split of brown rice and spring salad.  Spicy Tuna and Octopus for my protein along with some jalapeno, pineapples, cucumbers, seaweed salad, and ending with some sesame seeds atop.  I also went with a house spicy since I like a kick to my bowls.  Overall, I love the texture of the ingredients and freshness.  However, I wish my option of spicy tuna came diced instead of mashed.  The octopus help masked my protein mistake.  The option of jalapenos and pineapples was different in my books and both complimented my palates with a sweet and spiciness punch!  The sesame seeds provided a much needed aromatic kick since it has seemed I ordered too much spicy ingredients; spicy tuna, jalapenos, and house spicy sauce....oops my bad!  In the end, Pokedon is much welcomed to the Poke family of the valley!  Providing a much needed option of both culture and variety of food options in the valley.  Let's keep the poke love going! - Enjoy!",

My boyfriend and I split a large bowl with a mix of white and brown rice. The large comes with 3 scoops of protein- we got the spicy tuna, spicy scallop and yellowtail. For the sauce, we had the house spicy and the yuzu mixed together. And then we got all the toppings. It was pretty phenomenal.   For being in the desert, the seafood was pretty good. Coming from the West coast, I can be pretty picky with my fish. That said, I'll be coming back here.   The service was also really good. I appreciate a friendly smile and suggestions so much.   A couple suggestions that would have earned five stars:  1) have the option of actual bowls for people who want to eat in.  2) have the option of mixing the food together instead of just piling it on. It was hard to get a little bit of everything I wanted in one bite. I ended up stirring it together myself, but some of the toppings fell out in the process.   I'm really glad there's an affordable way to get some seafood in this city. Thanks Pokedon!",

The scoops were a scant two ounces each but at least they were fresh. I chose Spicy Tuna and Spicy Scallops. There was a good selection of toppings, including fresh seaweed. I added cucumber so she dressed it in sauce and then added it. A scoop of crab came with the cucumber selection. Nice touch there.   They offered five bases, such as white rice. There were seven proteins, seven sauces and 14 toppings. All in all, lots of choices.   The flavors were all bright and pronounced. I just wish they didn't skimp on the proteins so much.",

    "text": "Just ate here yesterday and I was very impressed.  I've been to AhiPoki and Pokitrition but Pokedon tops in terms of freshness and variety.  I had yellowtail, salmon and tuna bowl with many of the standard options (seaweed salad, crab salad, edename) but I never had a PokeBowl with pineappple before and it was a great contrast to the other flavors.  I had the garlic ponzu and it was the best sauce I've ever had on a poke bowl, even compared to the bowls I've had in Southern CA where Poke has been a trend for at least 2.5 years now.    I do like that they have grill options.  I didn't try any on my first visit but since my kid doesn't do raw fish it's nice to have options for her.  One thing to note, the online menu at this time has Gyudon (Beef Bowl), which was another reason I trekked from south tempe to this spot, but sadly they don't.  They do have steak teriyaki but Gyudon is completely different.    Great place, looking to try again sometime this week.  Update:  They now have Gyudon and it's excellent.  I love their Poke but sometimes I'll come here just for Gyudon.    Have some with red/pink ginger and it's a great filling meal.  There's only two other places that I know of that serve Gyudon in the local area, one in Tukee which is also very good but a bit pricey and one in the Chinese mall in Mesa which I'm not  fan of.  Also, I've had their Chicken Teriyaki, eggrolls and gyoza, all very good to excellent as well.  Just so you know this isn't a bogus review, I had their Chicken Katsu and I wasn't a fan.  Maybe it was just a bad day in an otherwise consistently great place to eat for Asian dishes.",

They also have other foods from the kitchen to accommodate for people who aren't big fans of raw fish. I really like the gyudon and the steak bowl.  For appetizers I would recommend getting he egg rolls. The sauce with that is also bomb. The owners are very nice and the service is always great. They have amazing customer care!",

But the last time I went there it was not as good and the ingredients didn't taste \"as fresh\".  That's why I had to ding it one star.  It is fast, and has a good selection of toppings (the picked cucumbers and spicy tuna and scallops are awesome.)  I put this place ahead of Tokyo Joe's etc.  Definitely worth a visit if the mood strikes you.",

They have a variety of sauces but I always get the house sauce with spicy mayo. You can get them on the side if you wish. There are also onions, roasted seaweed, sesame etc that can be added as well.

I had the chicken teriyaki plate and ordered a side of the spam musubi.   I was a bit worried about ordering the chicken teriyaki since I was afraid they might use bottled teriyaki sauce.   Not to worry.   If they did use the bottled version, the flavoring of the teriyaki chicken was good.  Maybe it's cause I had the musubi yesterday, but I thought today's version wasn't as good.   If the spam was fried, it needed to be fried more.  I didn't even seen a brown crust around it.  I would return.   I will probably have a build-a-poke bowl next time.",

They offer all the standard poke toppings and even offer fresh mango which is tough to find! The only upsell is for avocado which is $1.25, seaweed salad and crab mix is included in the bowl price. The poke was fresh, flavor packed and reasonably priced. I also love that they have actual bowls for dining-in instead of plastic takeout for the eco-friendly.

It's tucked in a strip mall just behind Ted's hot dogs and across the street from Joe's Italian Ice. Whoa. The foodie gawds were nodding in approval at my selection among the neighboring (less-healthy) establishments.  It's a great place to grab a quick lunch or a light dinner. The staff was extremely friendly, and was generous enough to offer samples of the shoyu tuna and yuzu vinaigrette. All topping options come with your bowl if you like, but avocado is an extra $1.25. I really loved the flavors of ginger and pickled radish in my bowl! Best part is that they not only offer poke, but they have non-poke options like chicken Katsu, chicken teriyaki, and spam musubi, which will surely make a few of my family members happy!  For only $8.95 I can enjoy a two scoop bowl, and for $11.60 I can really get busy with three scoops. Today, I went big and was able to enjoy some miso soup with my Yelp check-in as well. Thanks Pokedon! This will be a new go-to establishment for myself when looking for some poke near home - I'm hooked!",

I got a large poke bowl (3 proteins) for $12.54. I like how this place doesn't charge you extra if you want yellow tail.  It's pretty simple. You choose if you want salad or rice bowl. The option of white or brown rice. Second, you pick your proteins. Third, you pick your sauce.

The bowl was amazing again. The thai iced tea is good, but I might pass on it next time. I'm not sure it adds to the experience.   The place is very clean, plenty of seating. I'm perfectly happy at the communal tables but there are booths and counters as well. It's in a shopping center so the parking is adequate and easily accessed.   I'm looking forward to trying other things on the menu as well such as the chicken katsu and the teriyaki.

My husband and I have decided the content is not worth the price anymore and will be looking elsewhere for our poke needs. It's sad to say that, because we have loved Pokedon for so long but they've just really let us down on the poke front. $12 is too much, y'all.   The new reward system is not a reward system at all. It's periodic coupons that make the bowls cost the same as they used to. Pretty shady.   The new shoyu tuna is worth a try just for curiosity sake but not worth getting twice.   You may ask: why is your review still 4 stars then? Their new ramen (sat and sun only) is incredible. Like wow, really good. It has the perfect amount of chili oil and is all over just incredible. It also comes with green tea which I swapped with Thai tea and it was totally worth it. This is worth the price. Nothing else is really right now.",

It's always nice when employees are super friendly as it makes the experience even better. Pokedon has even more toppings for poke bowls than other poke places I've been to. Definitely give this place a try!",

I dined in and they now use dinner bowls to reduce their waste, so cool! I remember trying poke for the first time at another establishment and wondered why they didn't do the same. I'm happy about this change!  They had a new protein to choose from: shoyu tuna. When I inquired about it, the kind employee gave me two pieces to sample, so generous. Also he remembered my name from months back, which I was pleasantly surprised about. I got a regular bowl with the shoyu tuna, salmon, half greens and white rice and it was very filling.  This has become my favorite poke spot in the area and I will continue to recommend it to people who are interested in seafood. Though I may have to pass on the spicy mayo next time as it was too mayo-heavy for my liking.",

The sides I chose were: crab salad, seaweed salad, cucumbers (reg & pickled), Masago (fish eggs), onions, wasabi & toasted seaweed.  While it was comparably priced with other locations, the scoops of protein appeared smaller, but still filling.  I would stop by again when in the area.",

Being from Hawaii and growing up on poke ALL THE TIME, seeing the popularity of it grow here in Arizona is exciting! What's cool about this place versus old school poke ways, is that you can really deluxify your bowl by being specific to toppings,  and sauces. How cool! Its neat to see poke becoming so popular when I already knew it was so delicious! This location does an excellent job.

You have a selection of \"Protein,\" from salmon, spicy crab, spicy tuna (a.k.a. spicy ahi as it's usually called in Hawaii), shoyu tuna, etc.  Then you get a scoop of regular shredded crab on your bowl.  You then choose a sauce and other \"toppings\" like edamame, green onions, etc.  I've never had a poke bowl like it in Hawaii, but it was delicious!  It is a bit pricy by mainland standards, but compared to what we pay in Hawaii for poke bowls with much less \"protein\" and without all the toppings, the price seems appropriate.

I opted for the spring mix rather than the rice. I like that they had a starch free option. I was able to check-in and enjoy the free miso soup. It was very tasty and light. The poke bowl 3 scoop is more food than meets the eye as I was not able to eat it all. I will be coming back for more poke!",

    "text": "Pokedon 1753 E. Broadway Road Tempe, AZ  This review is written after dining at this establishment 2 days in a row. Some of this review reflects excellence, while some of it reflects problems which need to be corrected quickly if they are to stay in business.  Companion and I visited the first time and each ordered the large bowl combo. Lets break this down into actual food portions. You are first given a choice of white rice, brown rice, a spring mix of greens, or Wonton chips. Companion chose white rice and I chose the brown rice. Both were properly cooked and the person waiting on us filled the bowl 3/4 full with rice. Essentially, we were under the impression that they were trying to fill us up on rice.  Next was the protein selection. We were each entitled to 3 scoops. Companion ordered Tuna, Salmon, and Scallop, and I ordered Octopus, Tuna, and Spicy Scallop since I will never eat raw Salmon due to the possibility of parasites. The fish all seemed fresh though the Spicy Scallops did not seem to be very cold and were approaching room temperature.  You can choose from a plethora of sides all of which except Avocado are free. The Avocado is $1 extra. The crab mix was just fair, but the pickled cucumber and the seaweed salad were both excellent.  Next you get to choose a sauce from a group of 7 selections. Companion selected Ponzu mixed with House sauce, and I selected they Yuzu Vinaigrette. All the sauces were excellent and really buoyed up the proteins. It is noted that the fish is kept separate from the hot rice until this point.   Last was the opportunity to have any of 3 sprinkles on top. I chose sesame seeds while companion chose chopped sheet seaweed.  Since we ordered combo bowls ($2.50) we also received small bowls of Miso soup and our drinks.  We also ordered egg rolls ( 4 to a serving), which in reality were spring rolls. The \"egg rolls\" were fair at best, and after eating one, the rest were consigned to the refuse bin.  Portions on the first visit were of a good size and the waitress who served us was cheerful and willing to let us taste anything we asked about.  On the second visit I was alone and had a totally different experience. The fellow who served me skimped on everything including only putting a half scoop of Octopus in the bowl. When it came to the pickled cucumber and the seaweed salad he skimped again and said if I wanted more than he put in the bowl I'd have to pay for an extra scoop. The way he said it was a total turn off to me and  almost had me walking out. I again asked for the sesame seeds on top, and it almost looked like a sesame storm had hit the bowl.  The place is nice and clean, but unless they become consistent with portions they will not be around for long.  3 stars for quality of the proteins, flavor, and cleanliness. Hopefully if they get the portions straightened out I might be able to raise them to 4 stars.",

Love that they offer mangoes and jalapenos as sides. That's how True Hawaiian poke bowls are mad. Avocado is the only side that costs extra. They have a lot of different sauces and toppings. Lots of variety all around! All of the ingredients are of good quality. I like that they don't charge extra for yellowtail. I got salmon and spicy scallops in their spicy mayo which has a great kick.  They also have other food options aside from poke. They have appetizers and food from the kitchen such as fried rice and rice bowls.  Cons: portion size. Not sure if it was because they were offering $6 bowls or if this is their normal portion size but  I noticed they were being very careful with how much you were getting, I didn't even get a full scoop of salmon.   Customer service was great. I'll be back",

I tend to rotate around the different Poke places in the valley and Pokedon is definitely in the mix (Ahipoke Scottsdale and Pokitrition)  Highlights for this place: -Spicy scallop and yellowtail at no extra cost -Punch card -Free miso soup with Yelp check-in (at time of writing) -Location (close to ASU) -Super friendly staff  Pro-tips: -Scallop is the best fish-for-your-buck choice for one of your scoops -Half salad mix and half rice gives you the best portion ratio -Garlic ponzu + house spicy  but you can sample the sauces if you want -Avocado portion is pretty decent for the extra dollar -Jalapenos are mild so don't be afraid to put some in your bowl -Grab a punch card. They're one of the only ones who do it and you're gonna come back",

They suggested mixing the yuzu and garlic ponzu, which tasted amazing on my pile of fish deliciousness.  I like that they offer pineapple for the bowls.  It adds a different flavor and zing to the bowls.  The people who work here are always friendly and accommodating.  This is our new go-to poke establishment.",

Their menu is actually much easier to read then Ahipoki Bowl so that's a bonus. They have similar food options as well as trendy interior. Specifically for this location, customer service is decent; the employees are friendly and helpful. It's smaller but does have decent amount of seating. The serving size is pretty large and price is more fair than others I've seen.",

    "text": "So I probably should have written this after my first visit but for good measure I've returned about a bakers dozen more times just to be sure. I've gone on various days of the week sometimes multiple times a week just to confirm my suspicions are True that this place is fantastic. After all my research and getting to the point where the staff greets me by name I think it's well established that this place rocks.  I work right down the street and words can't really express how excited I was to have not only a new option for lunch nearby but it be a place to get some poke, which I love. I have tried pretty much all the fish except the octopus, all the sides and a bunch of sauce combos. Every time no matter how I mix it up I always end up full and happy with what I did. My favorite is probably going with the 2 salmon and 1 spicy tuna but will mix in some yellowtail and spicy scallop once in awhile. The scoop size is a bit on the larger size compared to other spots.  The sauces are where I vary the most but almost always include some of the fantastic garlic ponzu which might as well be called crack sauce with how good it is. It pairs really well with the yuzu for a brighter flavor or the house spicy for a flavor burst with a kick.  The best part about the bowls here is that you get so much for the price, the only things that cost extra are additional fish scoops and avocado (a hearty scoop for $1). The fact that a full scoop of crab mix is included is an awesome deal. The seaweed salad is standard fare but a bit bland, and the usually add ons like ginger, wasabi, edamame, masago and green onions are what you expect of them. The side that I love is the pickled cucumber, it really backs a great flavor that goes really well to get a bit of an acid to mix with all the other bright flavors in a bowl. I tried the pickled raddish but it just wasn't my thing. I don't do fruit in my food but they do have mango available.  One extra thing that is nice is the free miso if you check in. if I have any complaint here it's that I think the miso is a little on the watered down side but it's really minor especially when it is free. Also nice is the rewards card which gets you a free bowl after the 10th for somebody like me who is here at least once a week that pays off.  Last thing I want to say is that the staff is super friendly and nice. As established earlier they know me by name which really helps since one day I left my card in the chip reader (I hate chip readers) and they tracked me down on here to send me a message my card was there waiting for me, that's going above and beyond rather than just waiting for me to figure it out.",

    "text": "It was my first time visitingI never had Poke and wanted to try something new yesterday so I walked into Pokedon and I was not disappointed. The place was very clean and there wasn't a line. The person who was at the front was a male, glasses, and a hat who was super friendly (wish I got his name) but he helped me with the order because I didn't know what I was doing. He also let me try the sauces before committing to them. Poke itself is okay, I think it's a little too much sushi for me, but the fact that the person helping me was so patient and explained the process to me is the reason I'm giving this place five stars! If I was into a whole lot of fish I would have also given this place five stars because it was actually pretty good! It's basically sushi in a bowl. The food tasted fresh and as decently priced for the amount that they give. I only got a two scoop (regular) bowl which was more than filling.",

    "text": "The portion Was pretty small for the price, same size w ocean poke co., ahi poke has bigger size tho. Imo they used too much dressing so the veggie seems a bit wet and soaky. Dressings are ok, nothing to stand out. However, I appreciate them having interesting topping such as pineapple, pickle cucumber, and jalapenos. Also, I noticed they were not skim on the fishes. ;) Service also stand out as the girl who prepared the dishes for me was so nice and offered to let me try the sauce first before I decide. Thank you so much.  Serving teriyaki is a plus if your party has ppl who don't eat raw meat. I guess I would come back for this reason. Otherwise, i will go to ahi poke Tempe if I wanna be full or ocean co. in phx for a fresher fishes mixed.   Tips: come check out joe's Italian ice!! It's across the street!",

    "text": "I love Pokedon! It's a simple, no frills poke joint that gets the job done - and done well. I used to occasionally wander out to Ahipoki near my old apartment on the weekends, but stopped after moving. Pokedon is a quick drive from my work, and it's pretty much the only thing I get if I happen to not bring my lunch. I like that they don't try too hard to get \"unique\" with what they offer (which can turn into a big weird mess of a meal, in my opinion). Their pickled radishes are my absolute favorite, and it is now my staple in a poke bowl.",

    "text": "After spending some time in Hawaii last summer, I despaired ever finding poke again, let alone in Phoenix. I had no idea this place was here, and we stopped in due to my to curiosity when the line at the adjacent Ted's Hotdogs was too daunting.  I had tuna with spicy mayo and their house sauce and it was the perfect balance of savory and spicy. The price was excellent as well, considering that the large size is a generous three scoops of fish. I love that they have extras you can get in your bowls, like fresh fruit (today's was pineapple, but I hear they have mango often as well), jalapenos, and masago. They also have yellowtail, shrimp, and octopus for the same price as anything else, which is impressive.   The staff was very friendly and competent, and endlessly patient with my mother's confusion over the cuisine (she doesn't have a very adventurous palate), and let her try all their sauces.  I'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Poke was love at first bite for me. That was in Hawaii many years ago, and Phoenix has been slow to catch up to the growing trend.   Ahipoki Bowl out in Scottsdale is pretty decent, so I was happy to hear they were opening a location directly down the street from me. They were supposed to open their doors earlier this year, but it's almost a third of the way into 2017 and still no Ahipoki Bowl for Tempe.  Still, my roommate and I had a hankering for some poke and checked to see if Ahipoki Bowl was open by searching poke on Yelp. Instead, this place Pokedon pops up, isn't too far from us, and just opened.  Safe to say I'll be skipping on Ahipoki Bowl when it opens and instead I'll just be coming straight here. Pokedon not only has more options, but I think the ingredients are of higher quality. To say I was satisfied was an understatement, I've found a new favorite dig in Tempe.  Also, A+ on the staff. It was a slow Sunday afternoon and they took their time to interact and walk us through all of the different sauces and ingredients. Super chill and very friendly. The food is gonna bring me back, but the staff makes it easy to confirm that.",
