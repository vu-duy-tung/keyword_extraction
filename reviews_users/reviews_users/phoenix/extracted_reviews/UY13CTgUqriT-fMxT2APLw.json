    "text": "Best Pho in the Phoenix area - maybe even the best in the U.S.!  (Disclaimer: I've only eaten at Khai Hoan once, so far.)  What qualifies me to make such a bold statement about the pho at Khai Hoan?  I've had hundreds of bowls of pho.  Maybe even thousands.  I love pho.  I've had pho at every top rated restaurant in Little Saigon (Westminster), Orange County, CA.  There are two restaurants in Little Saigon that make good pho, most of the times.  (They both have slight consistency problems.)  I've tried the pho at almost every restaurant serving it in the Phoenix area.  Most of the pho here is not good.  A few places make pho that I'd order again.  Khai Hoan makes the best pho I've ever had from a restaurant in the U.S.  The broth has a deep beef flavor, with hints of the right spices, steeped for hours as the soup developed its flavor.  The herbs and vegetables served with the soup were all fresh, washed clean, and abundant.  (Many places don't provide herbs and vegetables that are fresh enough, or clean enough, or just plain enough.)  I also got to try the egg rolls, spring rolls and banh xeo at Khai Hoan.  They were all good and I'll gladly order them again, when I return for my next bowl of pho, which I will the next time I'm in the area.",

    "text": "i'm vietnamese, and my family in the old country was from the north (pho is originally a north vietnamese dish) and lived in the south. Hey this already gets me street cred. WORD.  I'm really a snob when it comes to pho. I rarely rarely ever order it unless i'm real homesick, or craving it like a 512 ( not those roxicets)  cause I am that loyal to the way my parents make it.  I think pho should be eaten without siracha, and without hoison just lime for acid kiddos.     I thought their pho was pretty good.  Sometimes at restaurants you can taste a lot of MSG in the pho.  Pho needs MSG kids and it's okay it's just soy product don't worry.   But sometimes it gets excessive and it just makes you crazy thirsty and you can just taste it immediately.  Since I don't pour sriracha and hoisin in my pho it also can smell just not as clean.  Ha, I can't think of how to describe this in english ( I swear i'm not a fob).  The portion was a decent size, and a good noodle to meat ratio.  I hate when It's all meat no noodles.  All in all pretty good and fulfilled my craving and didn't just make my homesickness worse like most of the time.  My friend had bun thit nuong cha gio (bbq beef, egg rolls rice noodles)   They have banh hoi too which is cool, I like that better than just bun.  It looked pretty good, he really liked it and they gave you two cha gio (egg rolls) cause lots of places are stingy here in arizona and like to give you one.   The guy  who owns the place is really nice really friendly guy.   A lot of people in the restaurant seem to be on very good terms with him which is nice.  He reminded me of one of my dad's friend's  I bet he even has a really bad gambling problem too ( ah the curse of the vietnamese) The place is really clean for a vietnamese place.  Vietnamese places aren't know for their cleanliness so a real plus.   Expensive I guess if you base it on Cen Pho's prices but much better food I think.",

This restaurant is very unassuming but it is really, really, really good.     I took other Yelp contributors' advice and had the Pho.  The Pho came out quickly, it was hot, had great flavor, and was pretty inexpensive.  Even though I've had Pho at other Vietnamese restaurants, this meal was truly great.  I am glad I succumbed to the Pho fascination that is infiltrating America because this iteration was some of the best Vietnamese food that I have ever had.   I have been fortunate enough to try great Vietnamese food in both Chicago's \"Little Vietnam\" and New York's Chinatown and it's not a stretch to say that Khai Hoan certainly equals the quality of the food that I had in both of those places.    Even though this restaurant has waiter service you must still go to the cashier at the end of the meal to get your bill.  That's hardly a reason to fault the restaurant especially since their food is so good and their prices are so reasonable.",

The kind you would drive by and never even notice if you weren't looking for it.  The pho has some of the best tasting broth and is a good portion.  It's about average price if not closer to the cheapest I have found.  It comes with a good sized plate of sprouts, basil, mint, lime, and jalapeno.  The spring rolls that I get have pork and shrimp in them and are a pretty good size.  The peanut sauce that comes with them for dipping tastes almost like fresh made peanut butter and has fresh ground pieces of peanut in it.  The service is fairly quick and very friendly, even with the fact that there is some language barrier.  I was actually taken to this place for the first time by an ex-coworker of mine who is an old vietnamese guy.  He told me himself that this is probably the best place he has found to eat pho at, and based on the fact that it is usually packed with asian people during lunch time, I am very inclined to believe him.",

    "text": "A block or 2 from the main Arizona State campus, DL introduced me to this Vietnamese plaza-embedded eatery, offering the well-known Vietnamese dishes typically found nationwide.  But besides these common goodies, one that I've eaten for the very 1st time was called Banh Cuon, aka Vietnamese Rolled Rice Cake/Crepe.  You're probably thinking of something literally sweet: nope, it's at the polar region, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/khai-hoan-restaurant-tempe?userid=jQYIE9bjrh9EP-B5FXpqPw#4FC85Th0ookwRhbqJ8p1-Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/khai...</a>.  Anyway, for DL it was his 2nd visit at Khai Hoan, & because I usually wanted the Pork & Egg Roll Vermicelli Bowl/#19 ($8.95) instead of Pho--the summer temperature further explained--he reordered the Banh Cuon Dac Biet Khai Hoan/#25 ($9.25), or in American terms Khai Hoan's House Rice Crepe.  My bowl was like every yummy Vermicelli Bowl I've devoured: excellently textured & filling meats, copiously bouncy noodles, and fresh veggies.  My major issue is that, based on many Vietnamese eats I've visited other than in CA (whether hole-in-the-wall standards or at popular status), at roughly 9 bucks it's the highest priced Vermicelli Bowl I've ever discovered--more than the cost found at my favorite place to get this hulk, located all the way in Minneapolis.  I looked at the prices of their Pho, too, & I'd rather save it for either in my home state or this local spot near DL's residence.  The next items slightly placed aside this concern.  Our drinks, i.e. our Thai Tea and French Press Iced Coffee, were at consistent value among other competitors U.S.-wide.  Both, to me, were sip-tastic, with the exception of the sub-average tapioca pearls.  As for the saved-for-last Banh Cuon, in spite of the monetary tag, this would be my only reason I would revisit.  The patted rice roll was consistently soft and uniformly thick without being mushy &/or too slippery.  Sandwiched in these rolls was some scrumptious stuffed ground pork.  For better complementary textures, we dove into the exact tastiness and texture of the grilled beef and egg roll, plus some thick very gnaw-friendly pieces of Vietnamese ham.  They were so tasty w/ the Vietnamese fish sauce that we made sure not to allow this platter go to waste, consequently expanding our bellies silly--though I do hope that there's an equally yummy version back in the OC.  Frankly, their prices are comparably steep, especially when you have a pleeeeeethora of Vietnamese restaurants scattered in either Southern Cali or metro Phoenix.  That said, I'd again be returning to this swell Tempe eatery when we both are cravin' for their signature soft & savory crepe.  In math terms: 2.5 stars for the price, 4.5 stars for Banh Cuon, plus 3 stars for everything else average out to 3 mixed stars.",

    "text": "This restaurant serves a killer pho ap chao - it makes my taste buds dance in ecstasy, it is so good.  This place is tucked away in the recessed end segment of a long strip mall on Apache Blvd, so it's easy to miss if you're not looking out for it. Service is fast, and the food is relatively inexpensive - prices are just a tad over those of most Vietnamese restaurants in the Valley. Their pho is OK, though I find the flavor to be somewhat one-dimensional, without the herbal complexity of the pho in, say, Pho Thanh or Pho Avina. And I find the pho to be a bit on the salty side. A squeeze from the lime wedge served on the side helps cut the saltiness, while the fresh herbs served alongside the pho help to give the flavor a needed boost.",

We ordered, watched big bowls of steaming pho come out, and ah yes, ours came too... i got vegetables and tofu, in chicken broth to soothe an incipient cold, my husband got a rice dish with chicken,,, both were excellent!  One of the owners came by, apologized for our having to wait as they were busy and short handed... we hadn't felt ignored at all, but did have a nice conversation with him about Phoenix and that we'd all escaped Southern California traffic... very good food, very pleasant interaction.  Don't come expecting fancy, but come hungry looking for a tasty meal!",

The broth is very flavorful, but not too salty.  There are plenty of noodles, and they are well cooked and have a lovely, somewhat firm texture.  The lemongrass chicken is bright and has a unique pleasant texture.  It also comes with a unique cracked rice that holds up well to the dish.  This is the only restaurant I've been to that serves this kind of rice.  I wish more places had it.  Spring rolls are solid, cheap and tasty.  The peanut sauce is a huge winner.",

I am not going to try to convince you to try Pho, because I never order it myself.  I usually order Bun, which is a dish of room-temperature vermicelli rice noodles on a bed of cucumbers, greens, and basil. On the top of all of this deliciousness is usually some sort of meat, usually pork or beef. I personally like the combination of spring rolls, shrimp, and pork/beef. Over all of this is what is called a fish sauce, but doesn't have a fishy taste and is rather sweet and savory.  The Bun at Khai Hoan is comparable to all the other Bun dishes I've had in the past. I feel that Bun and Pho are two Thai dishes that are difficult for restaurants to screw up.  Before you leave, don't forget to get a Thai iced or hot tea. It's inexpensive, delicious, and they have to-go cups.",

I've been going to this one for at least 8 years now and hasn't disappointed me. They don't mess around. Decor is the usual dumpy looking asian restaurant, where you need to walk into the kitchen to get to the toilets. However, the Pho is fantastic here. Price is very reasonable, you can get a large bowl of Pho Bo Dac Biet for under $7. Very generous on the meat, tendon and veggie. The beef is very tender, the broth is very flavorful (not too salty, not too bland, not MSG tasting) and the right amount of fresh veggies (basil, bean sprouts, lime, mint).Their spring rolls are also very well done, and the peanut sauce is to die for!  The service is very fast and polite servers.   This place is very popular among the college crowd due to the close proximity to Arizona State University. Definitely should give it a shot if you have never been to this Pho place, you won't be disappointed.",

This place is a gem! don't let the neighborhood fool ya. khai hoan is in a weird little strip mall (as are many of the best restaurants in az) on the other side of haji baba. they redecorated the interior recently so it's not as gritty as it used to be, but the food is still as delicious as ever.  my favorite dish is the #5, well done and tender beef pho with tendons. the broth is superb, the meat and vegetables fresh, the atmosphere authentic. the selection of beverages is also good, with the taro teas and the required drip iced coffee. they even have fresh coconuts and salty lemonade.  it's convenient that the light rail runs right by, but i've been known to drive all the way down from deer valley just for that soup.",

    "text": "BEST. PHO. IN. THE. VALLEY.  HIGH QUALITY PHO. HUGE PORTIONS. ACTUAL VIETNAMESE FAMILY MAKING THE FOOD.  The aforementioned points are very important for me. As someone who ranks pho as probably one of my most favorite foods in the world, I take pho restaurant critiquing very seriously.  Broth: 5 Stars - How do you tell if a pho restaurant is good from the get go? You order it. They bring it to your table. Get your spoon... and taste the broth. This is where the love and care shows, people! This place has some legit broth and it shows that they actually care for the food they are making.  Vegetables: 5 Stars  - Some places have nasty wilted bean sprouts... but at this place the veggies are always fresh. Good assortment of what's available: basil, bean sprouts, lime, jalapenos and some sort of cabbage-like leaf that has a great peppery taste.  Spring Rolls: 5 Stars - A lot of places has this pre-made, but this place makes it to order. You can tell because when you bite into it, you can tell the pork was just recently grilled.  The only tough this is they may forget to fill up your water cup just because it's so busy.  As a Seattle native who's in the area for school, I had gone to many other places only to be incredibly disappointed. Back in my hood, pho places are just as numerous as Starbuck's and a good place is hard to find. Coming into this restaurant reminds me of going to some of my favorite places back home... I'll always be a Khai Hoan-er for Life!",

I always get the pho tai nam. I should try other things, and will, but the pho here is damn good and super cheap.  The well done beef in the pho is really tasty and tender, and there is tons of it.    Not dressed up in the least, this place reminds me of many places in Chinatowns of 'larger' cities. The owners seem to be always present, a family operation.   I asked the dad about the possibility of doing sandwiches and he said they might, if they can figure out a way to get good fresh bread everyday. As much as I would like a good bahn mi across the street, I really don't need the extra 10 lbs.   Khai Hoan. Consistent. Flavorful. Variety. Simple.",

The spring rolls to start were really good and the peanut sauce was super yummy!   I got the vegetable pho with egg noodles. The broth was a little bit bland with a little hoisin sauce it was good. There were a lot of different vegetables in the soup and they were all super fresh and good quality!   The portion size was smaller than the average pho but considering the fact pho comes in huge portions it is not a problem.

    "text": "Is it possible to get tasty Vietnamese at a place where you don't have to turn a blind eye to the unwanted glimpses of the kitchen?  Yes, indeed.  While not a stunning polished restaurant by any stretch of the imagination, Khai Hoan is an impeccably clean little family place cooking simple good food in a strip mall on Apache Blvd.   The selections are tasty, plentiful and cheap with apps ranging from $3-$6 and Mains running from $6-$7.    I enjoyed the usual Vietnamese favorites of spring rolls and pho.  While the grilled pork on broken rice was nicely flavored, the meat was a touch on the dry side.    My favorite is the pickled papaya with charcoal grilled pork and meatball.  It's served with rice noodles, lettuce and fresh herbs.  The charred savory meat is nicely balanced by the sweet and sour papaya.  The rice noodles are great for absorbing the tasty broth.  But don't go here on a lazy Sunday...you'll be sorely disappointed since the place will be closed.  Don't forget to pick up some baklava from Haji-Baba (in the same center) for dessert.",

It is a little pricy compared to other Vietnamese venues but they do have Bun Cuon (rare treat that is a must here).  Their Pho were in par with local establishments.  The smile from the chef (older Viet lady) and bus person is great and I have a feeling that the tip went to the young kid who only took the order which it should have belong to the chef and the Mexican bus person who really provided the service.  May be I'll make a point next time to directly tip the person who really served me instead.  The owner said hi since he was doing electrical work, he was busy and couldn't serve me.  I will return whenever I have opportunities to run down there..It is extremely popular with ASU students so you will feel the vibrant energy there..Cool place to be.",

Boyfriend went with the pho, and he gave it two thumbs up. I ended up going with the Hu Tieu, which is made with either egg noodles or glass noodles.

Parking directly in front of the restaurant can be a little tight because it's busy but there's plenty of parking in the complex. Good to come with a group but is also a more intimate spot. Ordered the spring rolls as an appetizer, they can with peanut dipping sauce and were super delicious. Best spring rolls I've tried. I came here because I was craving pho and ordered their veggie pho. I loved the rice noodles, they were soft but not too thin. Got a huge bowl of soup with lots of veggies, broccoli, bok choy, cabbage, onion, carrots, and mushroom. Also had tofu. The veggie broth wasn't very flavorful but luckily they have trays of sauces and spices on the table so was able to add some chili sauce and soy sauce to get more flavor. They didn't have too many veg options but I was there for the pho so I was happy.",

The service is quick and the staff is extremely friendly and helpful. We've been doing takeout a lot recently, but the food is always just as good. We've tried a few different pho places in the area, but none seem to match up or compare to here! It's a pretty small restaurant that gets packed during mealtimes so you might have to wait a few minutes, but because of how quick the service is, you likely won't be waiting very long at all. Definitely recommend if you're looking for a quick bowl of high quality pho!",

The portions are large and you receive a separate plate with bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos, limes and other items to add to your pho if you please. My coworker has had a few meat and rice plates off the menu as well. He loved them! I would definitely recommend this place if you like pho!",

There broth is extremely flavorful. The meat is great quality, and the rare beef is always brought out freshly placed in the bowl so that it doesn't get over-cooked.  The rice dishes are also very good.   Sonny, the owner, is an amazing guy, and the restaurant is a truly family owned and operated business.  Also, I recommend checking out their 'sister' restaurant, Cyclo in Chandler. It is a very kitchy space with modern furnishings and bright, bold colors.",

The rice, shredded pork, grilled meat, pickled veggies were good; however, there was a weird looking patty meat, tasted good I guess, but I was just confused because I never had that on my Com Tam before. Also, the steamed egg was weird: it was super dry, yellow and gray in color, looked like a dry eraser. My friend said the Pho Ga was good. My other friend ordered broccoli and beef and it was a big portion (awesome), but it came out with like a yellow fried rice (he couldn't even explain it). We all ordered spring rolls, flavor was on point, but the rice paper was a little dry, making it tough to eat. I must commend this place on their great customer service though; they're always there to refill and take away whatever \"trash\" you have. I would go back to try out different items. Not everyday do you see a Vietnamese restaurant serve Banh Cuon, especially in AZ.",

The clever use of \"pho\" in the restaurant name? exa: What the pho? phoking good? - NO  The freshness of the bean sprouts, and herbs they give you? -NO (but this hardly is ever the case)  The Broth? -YES  This is the most important facet of pho, the broth pulls everything in the bowl together. Having said that the broth here is superb! Compared to other pho joints in the valley Khai Hoan's broth is by far the most unique and best tasting. The broth is savory, with a deep flavor. It is not sweet or salty, it is perfectly balanced. This place is small and quaint, they let their food speak for itself. Their selling point is in their broth.   Springrolls - Good portions of meat in the spring rolls. Generous shrimp and pork cuts. The peanut sauce is thick and sprinkled with fresh grounded peanuts. Its the best peanut sauce in my opinion. The sauce attaches itself to the spring roll, unlike other pho joints where the sauce is watery and thus upon dipping, the rolls do not retain much sauce and displeases my deprived taste buds of gravy peanut sauce. Khai hoans peanut sauce has the texture of Kindergarten glue, its great. I also use it to dip the meat from the pho!",

Make sure to get a portion of fried rice to take home with you to use in something that you make.   They have a TV in here, and it's usually on a sporting event. Whoever controls it watches a fair amount of soccer as well.   The one star you see missing from this review is because of the service.

Like do, re, mi FA, so, la, ti, do. Please fix yourselves.  : )   Now I'm in Arizona and I STILL crave Pho like nobody's business and then I heard about Khai Hoan.  Actually, this was my boyfriends first Yelp find and we love it.   My favorite is the summer rolls, and raw and cooked brisket Pho.  The summer rolls are better back east, but I'll take what I can get.  Also, the peanut sauce has chunks of peanut in it.  I don't care but some people like smooth peanut butter instead of chunky... Catch my drift?  The Pho is amazing.  It's exactly the way it is back in DC/VA. But... I have a secret...   I KNOW WHY!!!  The owner is from Arlington, Virginia!!! He's legit.  Not that he wouldn't be anyway as he is Vietnamese.  But there is a certain amount of street cred you attain when you're from Arlington.  Clearly... His Pho shows.

Second of all, I was disappointed with the pho itself. The soup lacked flavor and tasted watered down. The noodles were already soggy so they must have taken too long to bring the bowl out. There was a decent amount of meat but that didn't help with the bland taste of the soup itself. It was overpriced for mediocre quality.

The place itself really is average. Very casual setting, awkward huge fish tank in the corner, and workers eating in front of you. But hey, it's really not that bad when you go with someone who can hold conversation.   Pork and shrimp spring rolls are of very good quality, the veggies/meats are fresh, and they're not overly-covered with rice paper. The pho is very good. It is not too oily, which is a huge plus. The veggies are nice and fresh, and it is served piping hot, which is what I like compared to warm soup.

Their spring rolls however, are very good and I couldn't resist them whenever I would  drop in.   Khai Hoan is a decent lunch spot in Tempe for those looking for a PHO fix. I'm not into the Chinese side of their menu, and they are by no means the best the valley has to offer.

Cooked perfectly, and filled with lemongrass flavor in each bite.  I will definitely be coming here again to try more of their dishes.",

The wrapper was good, there was something slightly off with the filling. I thought the menu said it came with noodles, but mine did not. The plate for cha gio burritos was great otherwise  The ice coffee was pretty darn good. Nice coffee/milk flavor to it, ice creamy but not overly  The pho was just OK. The broth was missing depth. The beef flavor was there and the hint of lime. I wonder if it was just light on the fish sauce or the other spices. The meat was well sliced, though, and they have white pepper.  There is still better in the city, but I also didn't have the Bahn Cohn (sp) so that could be my issue not theirs",

For me, happiness at a Vietnamese restaurant is a big old glass of young coconut juice with fresh coconut pieces and lots of fresh herbs for whatever I choose to order - whether it's Meatball Pho or Bun with Grilled Pork or even crispy Cha Gio,  give me tons of greenery to use and a sea of nuoc mam for dipping.  This place keeps me beyond happy - the pho comes out piping hot and brimming with rice noodles and meat.  They do not skimp, whereas a lot of other places in the Valley cheap out.  Plus, their broth is fragrant and not greasy, making it a go-to if I've got the sniffles.  I typically come here for lunch and they do a bustling business - folks know that this place gets the job done and they show up.  You shouldn't have a problem getting a table as the service moves quickly.  What's not to love?",

    "text": "We went here for dinner on a Saturday night. Everyone wanted some Pho so I pulled out my handy dandy Yelp bookmark and Khai Hoan it was. I trust all my Yelp friends.   It's a small little place in a strip mall with pretty limited parking. This is one of those Asian mom & pop with just a few tables with nothing really decorated. Pretty bland but we came here for Pho and the food. Everyone says this is the best Pho place.  When you walk in there's really no one to greet you. We looked for a table and they somewhat guided us to the table since we had a party of 6. Menus were given to us and water cups passed out fairly quickly.    We started off with their egg rolls, shrimp spring rolls, and beef spring rolls. All of the spring rolls were really good but I really liked the shrimp the best. Love the peanut dipping sauce. Nice and fresh. Everything was exactly what I was expecting. The egg rolls were really good. Nice and crispy with lots of filling. Just how I like it. So our appetizers were really good.   I was going to get the Pho cause everyone said its the best but my wife ordered the Pho I was going to get so I decided to get something else. Was also told the Bun was good. So got the #23 bun tom thit Cha gio. Don't know what that means but it had grilled pork and shrimp with egg roll, little salad, and rice noodles. Really good. You get a nice balance meal with the bun. Fresh and good. Really enjoyed it and gobbled it up.   My wife got the pho tom Cua which is seafood noodle soup with shrimp and crab. Didn't get a chance to grab a bite but she didn't complain at all. Everyone loved their food and they give out really big portions. I was the only one who finished their meal. Then again I'm a big eater.   It's not the cleanest place. Typical small Asian restaurant. Their bathroom is in the back. You have to go through the kitchen and you can watch them prepare the dishes. So kitchen seemed pretty clean and surprisingly the bathroom was really clean compared to other Asian mom and pop shops. Not bad at all.   Service was pretty good. Water cups brought out quickly but we did have to ask for refills. Like I said no real ambiance. Pretty bland but you don't come to these type of places for that. It's all about the food. Very fresh. Very tasty. Really good food and they bring out the food really quickly. So if you're looking for some good Pho, Bun, spring rolls and egg rolls this is the place for you. Man was this good.",

They always have very good customer service and all the servers are friendly and welcoming to everyone who steps foot in the restaurant.  I was thought it was interesting how they had an arrangement of Asian food on the menu; it's not only limited to Vietnamese food which I think is interesting for large groups. I've only been here for pho, but they never disappoint! I usually get the #10 which is the seafood pho and it includes shrimp and imitation crab and lots of noodles!   This has been my spot since I moved to Tempe 2 years ago and ever since I've hooked my boyfriend on this place too so I definitely recommend! The only downside would be the location of the bathroom; you have to go through the kitchen and the staff glares a you a little it. Seems strange to have a public restroom there, but it's a small establishment so understandably there is little space. Hopefully it'll change in the future but I'll still be coming back for more!",

The chicken fried rice was....... well the rice first of all didnt have any vegetables it was just chicken and rice fried....(?) is that normal? Most fried rice i get from pho restaurants have at least onions or peas or carrots lmao but yeah it lacked flavor although they had a large portion size???   Would not come again",

Money isn't a thing for me when the food is good but damn it! I am so pissed off that I've wasted one meal and an appetite on basically jail food.   Ordered 2 banh cuon togo and the ground pork filling was so dry. Shrimp paste/ cha tom was also dry and flavorless. The banh cuon dac biet only had cha lua? Maybe she heard me wrong. Nuoc mam sucked!!!!!! Didn't even add any chili or provide me with it so I could throw it in myself. And way too much banh (rice cake) ratio vs filling and veggies! Both my dad and I threw most of it away. Perhaps we are spoiled with decent food all of our life? BUT SERIOUSLY it was one of the worst meals I've ever been so unfortunate to come across. This probably ruined banh cuon for me, for freakin good.   Also, I saw some lady get a cafe sua da (viet coffee) so I followed suit. Instant regret!!!!!!! Oh my god it tasted like powdery mud.   How dare these people serve customers such crap.",

    "text": "This place used to be my place to go for pho, but then I had a bad experience (the water tasting funny and the veggies not being so fresh) and decided to try some other places.  (This was during the summer however and I will say that based on the 6 years of living here in Tempe, many of the restaurants that stay open during the summer start to falter with the quality and freshness of their food.  A problem which I hope will be rectified this summer.)   But, given that it has been quite chilly lately and school is still in, I recently decided to give this place another try.  I agree with all the other reviews about this place.  The pho, the portions, the price, and the service are all very good.  No problems with the freshness of the veggies this time.  But I am still adverse to the water (I think it is non-filtered tap water) and one of the lettuce leaves that came with my egg rolls still had some dirt on it.    Also, note that this place, given the weather and its size, was packed during the usual lunch hour when I visited.  But, the table turnover was pretty quick and you only have to wait a few minutes if at all to get a table.  But, you might have to share a table with someone if you are a single.",

Any place that can make a good banh xeo (and be generous with it too), gets a huge thumbs up from me already. Along with so many other dishes like banh cuon and com tam bi, there's a lot to try out. I also finally tried some of the pho today and it's definitely better than what I've had in other restaurants (family kitchen's another story). All too often, I find the broth to be too light and flavorless, but at least today's pho was dark and had flavor, if still somewhat weak. It was also fast too, pretty much within 5 minutes of ordering. Maybe I'll suffer the inconsistent broth other reviewers stated.  Finally, to all the reviewers about the bathroom: get over it. I've seen a LOT worse, and while one may have to cross the kitchen to get there, blame the building owner and developer who designed the damn layout of the place. Heck, I'm sure there are city codes being broken there, so I'm sure the city would love to know.",

Perhaps one of the best indications of a good ethnic restaurant: There were plenty of customers of the ethnicity in question.   Service was very good.

The Pho soup was good but it really needed more meat in order to satisfy. I like really chunky, chock full of whatever kind of soup and I just felt this needed a little extra. The taste, however, was great. Unique in and of itself.  If you are super craving Vietnamese I would recommend going here.

It's out of this world good!  If pho is in your future, be forewarned that the serving sizes are massive. I have never been able to polish off an entire bowl. So come extra hungry and skip the tempting spring rolls (also delicious with a killer spicy peanut sauce). Because if you've ever made the mistake of trying to stretch out a bowl of pho by taking half of it home, you know the disappointment that comes along with that cloudy bowl of watered down leftovers. Rice noodles just don't hold up well. Le sigh.  Lately I've taken to phoning in my order and picking up my Pho To Go (someone needs to snatch up that name, stat!) at the same price as the dine in option ($6-8). I have discovered the secret to pho longevity this way. Noodles and beefy parts are packaged separately and the broth is also in its own container. Nothing gets water logged and cloudy and I can easily make four meals out of one order. They toss in all the baggies of goodness too! Bean sprouts, basil, limes, jalapeno and mint in one; cilantro and spring onions in another. Hoisin and sriracha on the side. I seriously get hog wild with these additions. It's like a new bowl every time I try it!",

In fact, I don't think I have ever found it.   My wife will always order the Pho, and I will take little bites, here & there.   Overall, whenever I go to Tempe I make sure to swing by",

    "text": "This Vietnamese restaurant is one of my frequent stops in the area. I first discovered this place on Yelp, and since then have tried a variety of items on the menu. The squared-shaped interior is largely dependent on natural lighting. The horizontal layout includes TVs, rows of tables, and a small kitchen in the back.   For appetizers, I recommend the Goi Guon ($3.95). The spring rolls come with grilled pork, shrimp, rice vermicelli, and peanut sauce. The ingredients were fresh, ranging from the rice wrapper to the contrasting tastes and textures embedded in the middle. For this dish, I often ask for fish sauce on the side. It's a good opener for those who wanted something to hold them over until the main entree.   The menu consists of Chinese and Vietnamese dishes, but I come here largely for their signature item: Banh Cuon. To me, this is one of the best Banh Cuon I've tasted so far due to the stuffed minced pork and soft fluffy rice crepes. Among the options, I recommend the Banh Cuon Cha Lua ($8.95) that comes with slices of Vietnamese ham, chopped red leaf lettuce, basil, herbs, pickles and fish sauce. I also suggest the Banh Cuon Chao Tom ($9.25) that comes with soft golden fried fish cakes. The combination of fresh and fluffy textures, perfect thickness on the rice crepe, delicious toppings, and fish sauce made this particular menu item a must try for first time goers.   Their Pho ranges from $7.95-$8.95 per bowl. The lack of depth in the mild-flavored broth was a consistent pattern from each of my visits. Even though the broth couldn't stand on its own, I find ordering those that come with more than one meat item such as Pho Tai Nam Gan ($7.95) and Pho Tai Sach Bo Vien ($7.95) an effective method to circumvent the problem. Their pho also comes cilantro, yellow onions, scallions, bean sprouts, basil jalapeno and lime. The side of veggies is always fresh. I only wished the broth could offer more depth and complexity, especially given the high price they charge on these dishes.  The Bun Thit Gio thit Nuong ($8.95) came with great textures ranging from the grilled pork, bouncy noodles, and fresh veggies. I really enjoyed this dish, but again the prices are simply too high for me to rate this place higher.  Lastly, their Thai Tea with Boba ($3.50) was too sweet with boba that was old and staled. I don't recommend it.  Service was prompt but limited to the extent of taking your order, bringing food to the table, and the bill at the end. Given the strengths and limitations of this place, I'd be very strategic in ordering items that are associated with rice noodle crepes, vermicelli, and quite possibly, the noodle sticks. I'd be very interested in coming back to try their Banh Hoi items.",

    "text": "This was always my go to Vietnamese shop. I dont remember when we discovered it but it had to be some time in 2000- 2001. Because i was on the the red line valley metro bus to get to and from work. Its route went back and fourth on Apache blvd. And i worked split shifts with 3 1/2 hours betwee shifts. . So i found places to go get lunch that were right on the red line route.  I still cannot find a Vietmamese shop here in Portland that does Pho as good as Khai Hoan. I always got the vegan pho. They loaded  it up with a wonderful assortment of vegetables. It was delicious. Bok choy, broccoli, carrots, snow peas, fresh mushrooms, corriander(cilantro) a few tofu,  and fresh ginger. And not just a small amount of vegetables  the bowl was full to the top with these veggies. Instead of rice noodles i would sub clear glass noodles and they had no problem doing that. I didnt care for an overload of noodles so they would always scale back the amount of noodles for me. The added bonus of the side plate of basil, bean sprouts, mint, cilantro , dandelion greens, jalepenos and lime was perfect. So many Vietnamese restaurants will give such a small plate of this which for me is always dissapointing. Khai Hoan gives a full plate of it; as well;  they would bring me some extra fresh chopped ginger. I had become a regular and the waiter knew what i liked and i wouldnt have to ask.  They get an extra star because they have fresh coconut to drink.  Every place ive been to lately for pho;  fill the bowl with tofu and rice noodles and barely any vegetables at all. Extremely unsatisfying and disappointing. .   I think they use MSG. But they told me its very minimal. And the vegan pho has no msg.   Take the light rail east. Get off at Dorsey and walk east on the south side of the street or get off at McKlintock and walk west south side of the street. You'll find Khai Hoan in a shopping plaza right next to a mexican carnarceria and a smoke shop.  I miss you Khai Hoan. Please come to Portland and show them how pho is done right.",

Prices here are probably on par with other places but you most definitely get your money's worth, especially with the #1 (or Pho Xe Lua, so the online menu tells me) .  The broth isn't too sweet or too salty (this is starting to read like Goldilocks) and the portion sizes are good enough to satisfy me and all the bottomless pits I fondly call, my friends.  I've personally never had anything other than the pho here, but I've heard that #13 is pretty good, and the kung pao chicken was ordinary.  Though I'd never order kung pao chicken unless I was beaten and tortured into submission to eat at Panda Express.  The owner is also really friendly and always takes the time to talk to my boyfriend because he and his ex-roommates used to frequent the place 2-3 times a week.  Quick note, if you're planning on splitting the bill, bring some cash along cause there's a $10 minimum to use your card.  Or just add-on an iced coffee or if you're adventurous, the salted plum juice!",

Their red bean and coconut milkshake kept me alive during flu seasons in New England.  Now we are in a new era...or at least new area and I was jonesing for some PHO. My brother found this place and I can't believe how often I drove or rode my bike past this tiny lil complex without realzing Pho was in my vicinity all along. Walking in, its set up like a proper Pho place should be- absolutely NO FRILLS. White walls, simple tables and chairs, tvs on, and ordering counter with pyramids of spring rolls waiting for your take out bag. We got tea and water right away and I spinned around the Lazy Susan-yup, all the sauces and utensils are there. Check. I got the simple veggie Pho and veggie spring rolls with cold soy milk (it can get really hot and the broth means the heat can stay on your lips-soy milk is a good way to counter the effect). Delicious. Nothing crazy, all fresh, no non-sense staff, cheap amazing prices. Quick service and my Pho craving totally sated-this may be my new places I stop on my bike to eat something fast besides the near-by notoriously slow-serviced Pita Jungle.",

A group of us just skydived and some had queasy  feeling, so I suggested Vietnamese food. A quick Yelp search led me here and everyone in the group was very pleased with their lunch.  I started with iced Thai tea. I thought sweet Thai tea was perfect for my tired body and it was. One person on my table also tried per my recommendation, she liked it as it wasn't too sweet.  Spring rolls was good, good way to start lunch as they are not heavy and give me an opportunity to eat more vegetables.   Pho dac biet was very good, their hot soup was so comforting for my stomach. I wouldn't say meat portion was generous but seemed they had more noodles than I've had from other restaurants.  They let us pay all individually, I think we all paid by credit cards. Minimum for credit card is $10. We went up to the counter, each declared what we ordered and paid separately for own meal. I appreciate they let us split a check without any issues.  Service was very friendly, relatively close to several major freeway, I would come back if I am in the area.",

My domestic journey started with sampling nearly every Vietnamese joint in the Valley from Gilbert to Goodyear. My appetite was insatiable... I even ventured to Vietnam in 2013 with a large motivation being culinary adventure and my love of everything related to pho  I can say with the utmost honesty that I have never come across a better broth in all my experience than that at Khai Hoan. Is eating pho tai on a low plastic stool in Ho Chi Min City a near religious experience? Yes, of course. Does that mean that this state of beef noodle soup nirvana can only be achieved in the Far East? Absolutely not.   It can be attained right here in Tempe and we are so lucky for that",

It was also dry and dark colored. I'm very sure it's old beef. Leftover beef and cooked again or something. It was honestly so hard that I'm a little scared now lol. They give you a lot of the meat, but then it just went to waste because I couldn't even eat it at all. I do like how they give you a lot of pork blood cubes, which are my favorite part of the dish. I felt like the broth needed more flavor to it. I had to put like two table spoons of fish sauce to the soup, which I normally do not. Maybe the soup just needed to be cooked longer so the flavor can build up. They had a $10 card minimum.",

It's a small hole in the wall looking place but serves pretty authentic and good tasting Vietnamese food. Currently didn't try the pho, but judging from other people's bowls, it looked pretty good and the portions seemed huge. The prices are a little higher from what I saw $10 vs $8 at other places in Mesa or in Chandler.   I would definitely recommend the bahn cuon, which is a minced meat dish wrapped in a rice noodle. Pretty tasty especially with the fish sauce. Might not be for first-timers or for people who are not used to Asian foods.   I also got pho ap chao, which is a crispy noodle deep fried, then doused with a noodle sauce with meat and veggies. Pretty good!   I would definitely recommend this place in you're in Tempe. I will definitely come again to try the pho.",

    "text": "Hands down the best Pho I've had thus far in Arizona! Drove from Northern Phoenix and found the food well worth the drive.   Came in with a couple of gals to have Pho for lunch and came in with big appetites. We decided to start with Egg Rolls (Cha Gio) and Veggie Spring Rolls because we were super hungry and we had a Vegan with us. For the main entree, I opted for my personal favorite: Pho Tai, simple bowl of Pho with thin raw slices of beef and typically topped with onions and/or green onions.  The Egg Rolls came out fresh and piping hot, filled with Wood Ear mushroom, meat and a bit of veg and served with dipping sauce. These also come out with a few cucumbers, perilla and lettuce to eat with the Egg Rolls. Two thumbs up for scalding hot egg rolls, delicious in flavor and pretty big in size.  Pho Tai came out in a small sized bowl, but filled with noodles, a beautiful brown broth, slices of thin beef and sliced green onions. Don't be fooled by the small bowl, it holds a good amount of noodles and broth nearly at the brim. The broth was absolutely delicious and as close in flavor to the Pho I was raised on and can be found in the Bay Area. Good balance or savory, sweet and aromatic. The pieces of beef were actually really tender and soft to eat, I've found that some places provide really tough slices of beef which ruins the eating experience. Another good sign here is the freshness and abundance of greens served along side your Pho. Here they serve a good amount of bean sprouts, lime, jalapeno, mint and Thai basil. So go right ahead and pile what you want in your Pho and I don't care who says it, go ahead and add Hoisin and Sriracha to your soup. You're the one eating it!  Service here is expected from most Vietnamese establishments, pretty casual and informal. It's not uncommon to see owners, staff members or family having their lunch at tables in plain sight or on their phone. Though it's the type of environment that's not found in corporate or chain restaurants, these mom and pop shops serve up what's real. The man serving us was great, he took our orders, refilled waters and was always an earshot away if we needed anything. Definitely, would come back. Don't judge this place by it's decor or casual service style, these bowls of soup are amazing! Came in hungry and practically had to roll out and with take out boxes!",

I remembered a past visit here, and had an OK experience.   I figure with a more relaxed situation (last time was a rush), and a pleasant afternoon, things might be better, and they were.  Just like my last visit, I went with the Bun. It was better than I remember it. More flavorful, the spring rolls were phenom, and as always the service was fantastic.  The only thing that held me back from a five star, was the lack of ice cold air conditioning.   They had some fans blowing, and it was a tad muggy, but I joked to my lunch date, \"the weather in here is authentic, like Vietnam\". Haha!  Luckily there were no complaints on the other side of the table. My friend ordered the Chicken pho. She downed it like a champ and was very happy.   Whenever I am in Tempe, I'm definitely hitting up Khai Hoan.    One last tip.....$10 minimum for credit card. But it shouldn't be a problem.",

I had to come visit this joint because of all the reviewers who claim it's to 'die for'.   Perhaps I am spoiled living in the land of the Northwest and great Asian food.   Location was hard to find (even with GPS) because of the giant tree and not greatly signed storefront. When I finally found it and walked in, it wasn't too crowded but not too slow either.   The owner didn't seem 'that' thrilled to serve me & my girlfriend and was quite rude in the way he'd cut you off mid-order to ask if you wanted beef or pork.   I opted out of Pho because some reviewers had said they never tried anything else. A good judge of a restaurant is that it can make more than the noodle soup.   So I went with the spring rolls as well as the bun thit nhuong. For those who aren't familiar, it's the vermicilli noodles & charbroiled pork.   My dish came out and it was definitely not 'traditional'. Instead of the meat on skewers or even charbroiled, it was just sliced meat on my noodles.   It was nothing to write home about and the owners/wait staff seemed bored as hell. It was a Monday night and the place seemed busy but I imagine when you live in AZ - you don't get much authentic Asian food.   Skip it unless you're wanting to say you had Pho.",

The pho soup is great, and although the spring rolls are just a little lacking in flavor, they also are very good. It seems that there are plenty of options here, too, so I definitely want to explore more of the menu. For instance, they have \"rice rolls,\" which are basically stuffed rice crepes.

Now, as I've said before, I am a pho snob. I just am. I have come to accept it and embrace it. Khai Hoan is somewhere between 2.5 and 3 stars for me, and because I'm a generous person, I am delving out a 3 star review.  Pros: * The service is fast. * The staff is really friendly * They offer a bunch of varieties of pho an pack the veggie pho with lots of broccoli and bok  Cons: * It's not located in the best area of Tempe * The broth wasn't extremely flavorful (definitely beef based) * You get a small portion for the price of the pho. $7.50 for what would be considered a small bowl of ho anywhere else I have been.  Ok, last thing, which was really, really...odd...the bathroom is located behind the kitchen. Wait, let me rephrase, through the kitchen, then behind the kitchen. Wait, let me try that again...you have to walk through the kitchen while the cooks are back there cutting up fish and other random food items in order to reach the bathroom. It feels...well...unsanitary and quite awkward to traipse through the tiny kitchen, trying to avoid running into the person with the huge knife, while food is being prepared. See? Odd, right?",

    "text": "OVERALL: I'll be back, and probably very soon.  THE GOOD - The service. It was incredibly speedy (unlike previous pho experiences) and everyone was incredibly friendly. I actually noticed many patrons knew the employees well enough to ask about family and recent trips!  - The broth. So good. While I was too full to finish the massive amount of tasty noodles, I still made sure to drink all my broth!  - The price. For a huge, delicious, satisfying meal and taking home enough for later, $12 wasn't bad at all. I definitely didn't need the appetizer of spring rolls and that would've knocked me down to $8 easy.  THE BAD - Being new to this restaurant, I walked in a bit aimless. There was no one waiting to greet and seat, but at the same time this isn't self serve. I walked up and asked if I should seat myself and grabbed a menu, but the guy behind the counter acted like that was a bit out of the norm. It was mildly awkward.  - This restaurant is quite casual and *almost* divey, in that each table has its own napkins, spoons, chopsticks, etc. The table I sat at had only 2 napkins left and very little chili paste, but I didn't see anyone moving to restock it anytime soon.  THE UGLY - Good pho has a bit of a kick to it, and Khai Hoan doesn't disappoint... so when your water runs low or completely out, it's a bit of a bummer. They did refill it eventually, but it took them longer than my mouth wanted.",

A friend recommended this Viet place and spoke very highly of it! The staff are very friendly and it's like your typical Viet service: straightforward. Once you're finished you pay at the front desk.  I got bun no hue and my friend got hu tieu. The hu tieu broth was pretty average, which is good! And it looks like the noodle to topping ratio was 2:1 but she liked it. My bun bo hue was bland so I asked for shrimp paste.   One thing that's really unique is that they offered soda xi mi which is essentially dried salted plum w sugar and carbonated soda water. Not a lot of Viet places in AZ offer this drink. The drink was refreshing! 10/10 would recommend trying it if you're feeling adventurous.  I feel like this place has a lot more to offer so I'll be coming back to try other dishes in hopes of giving it higher reviews.",

The pho noodles were made on point, and the meat portions were generous. To top it off, the broth was incredibly ric and tasty. Moreover, the waiters were friendly enough, and the decor inside was simple and clean.  I do want to reiterate again that the pho is the star of the show that should not be missed! I did order a rice plate to-go that unfortunately was unmemorable, given that there are other Vietnamese restaurants around that specialize in rice plates. I'd also like to add that I'd probably avoid ordering Chinese food from this place since this is primarily a Vietnamese-based restaurant.",

Pros: fairly Quick service, LOVE LOVE LOVE the garlic wings, and they offer more lettuce/sliced veggies without you having to ask.  Cons: pork chop and grilled pork were both on the drier side, the fish sauce was definitely saltier/fishier than most Vietnamese fish sauces I've had (more like Filipino fish sauce for those who have tasted that), and the fried egg rolls were not as flavorful as others I've had.

    "text": "Decided to update my 2010 review!  Mom and I enjoy pho very much, but she can't remember dining here all those many years ago, so I suggested we return.  I made my requisite phone call and asked:  1.  Do you serve egg noodles, and may I get these rather than rice noodles in my pho?  Yes, and yes.  2.  Do you offer both seafood and beef broths/stocks as pho options?  He said they offer both chicken and beef and added that most places only serve beef.  3.  Do you use MSG in pho items?  Yes, as do \"most places.\"  Mom ordered the \"#1,\" which was a combo of meatball, steak, and tendon, though \"not much 'laman',\"  meaning that the meat ingredients were sparse in her opinion.  She really enjoyed the soup, though, and, it looked to me, a lot of rice noodles.  Her request for an extra plate of bean sprouts, lime wedge, and mint leaves was met with a gracious smile and prompt execution!    I decided to skip pho due to the MSG involved and instead ordered the beef lo mein, and chose to add side plates of steamed rice, crab puff, one fried shrimp, and pork egg roll for $1.50.   (Intention was to have mom give these to my aunt during her visit, but Mom just asked me to take leftovers home.)  The beef lo mein was delicious, but I am almost positive that it contained MSG, as well.  If I were to order this dish again, I would request extra veggies added, such as snap peas, or broccoli, because I can't eat the julienned carrots included-- I want more veggies!  Also ordered Vietnamesfe coffee.  It's basically a shot (perhaps a very concentrated double-shot?) over condensed milk.  Swish it around a bit and then pour over ice.  $3.25 plus tax.  Delicious, but may I suggest offering this beverage in two sizes, our perhaps serve the original size in a smaller glass?  I had about two small sips before transferring the rest into a to-go glass (super-concentrated creamed coffee!) and well, you can imagine what my mom thought when she saw how little space the remaining liquid occupied...  I plan on adding more ice when I drink the leftover coffee at home.  KH offers Styrofoam for takeout and leftover packaging.  I try to avoid supporting Styrofoam pollution.",

    "text": "Good spot for pho in a quieter area of Tempe. Prices are fairly standard for AZ (about $1-2 more per item compared to San Diego).   Egg rolls weren't bad. A little dry for my taste, but good flavor. They're not at all stingy with their vegetables here, and even include cucumber/carrots, which I don't usually see at my pho spots! My family ordered 2 Pho Xe Lua (#1, \"Everything\" Combo Beef) and 2 Pho Tai Nam Gan (#5, Rare+well done beef & beef tendon). Overall the consensus was pleasantly surprised with quality! They don't give you the largest portion of meat, but it's a solid bowl. The broth is SO flavorful, and didn't seem to be full of MSG like so many of pho experiences. (My family didn't feel alarmingly thirsty after this meal as we often do post-pho).  The Thai tea was just right and not sickeningly sweet like some places tend to do.  If I'm back in the area, I think I'll be back to Khai Hoan for my pho fix!",

The owners and staff are so kind and are happy to discuss menu items and give you pointers on what to try (or what sauces to mix with certain dishes). They check in you often to keep the drink glasses full and make sure you're good and happy. And the food is absolutely delicious. By far my favorite pho in town, and I use up every drop of the delicious peanut sauce that comes with the spring rolls. I'll never forget how worth it it is to drive to this side of town for my Vietnamese food cravings again. One of my overall faves. Ok fine, I decided: KHAI HOAN!! Go, go, go!!",

The actual seafood was fine but overall I probably wouldn't order pho from here again.  Broken Rice Plate (Grilled Pork) = Food was great but it was quite pricey considering how close this restaurant is to the university.  Chicken With Broccoli (Lunch Special) = First item I tried from the Chinese menu and it was not bad at all, not to mention great value for lunch time.

The pho broth is nice and light. Also, the Mi Xao is done excellently. I always order the appetizer sampler with my brother (Spring roll, egg rolls, crab puff, and fried shrimp) and the variety of flavors was superb! The prices are relatively cheap too - which is a good thing as it's a 10 minute walk from ASU and accesible by the light rail.  It's a bit of a mixed opinion here, but my friends ordered Chinese food at this Vietnamese restaurant (-_-;) and I got conflicting opinions. One guy said that his was awesome, while the other said some of his chicken was uncooked. However, I get fried rice from time to time, and that's done perfectly.  If this is your first time, I suggest starting with the pho tai (#3). If you're THE culinary expert on pho and don't like it, just shut up and eat. As of now it's the best pho in Arizona, and it's a nice change of flavor for those who haven't eaten Vietnamese in a while, or ever!",

Hubby tried the chicken pho and I a grilled pork chop atop pork fried rice.  The latter dish was the recommendation of the waiter (John) when I told him that I wanted pork but nothing with a sweet sauce.  The pho came with the usual accompaniments: basil, jalapenos, lemon, and bean sprouts.  Hubby had ask them NOT to put noodles in and John suggested they add veggies instead. (Don't you hate a man that watches his figure?)   He let me taste the broth and I thought it was incredibly delicious.  He thought the chicken was overcooked, but I reminded him that it was chicken breast and thinly sliced so the longer it's in the hot broth the more cooked it gets.  AND  what restaurant is going to chance serving barely cooked chicken? He cleaned his bowl and next time he wants to try the rare beef PHO.  My dish consisted of a very thin pork chop over a bed of fried rice--a real huge portion of rice.  The pork chop was not dry and had a char-like flavor.  The rice was NOT greasy and tasty.   We really like the customer service here as well as the food.  The pricing is very fair and we felt it was a good value for the money.  Come by sometime.",

Coffee has a ton of condensed milk, just like they make it in the motherland. Pho was good, just came in a small bowl and filled to the brim so it was hard to add fixings.  Meh: Hu Tieu, limeade, and pricing. The Hu Tieu was kind of weird as it had a pork/shrimp shu mai in it, along with imitation crab meat, maybe it's a regional spin I'm not familiar with since I was raised on southern style. I still prefer Hu Tieu at Pho Thanh. I get the pricing- it's next to the college.   Definitely won't go out of my way to eat here.",

We had lots of questions since it was our first time here, but they happily answered and made great suggestions.    I always base my review of a Vietnamese restaurant on my three favorite Vietnamese foods. Spring rolls, pho, and Bun tht nng. They nailed everyone!   Everything was really good and authentic, you will not be disappointed.   The pho was not lacking in meat either, the broth was flavorful and full of noodles. My two daughters shared it and they still had lots of leftovers for me to try.  I did try to order Bun bo Hu for the kids who love spicy food, but the waiter told me that it's made with pork blood and heart (but can be made without it). A bit differently then I've had at other places. I'll definitely be ordering that for myself when I go back again.  I appreciated him giving me the heads up.   My husband was sad that they didn't have Banh mi, but their menu is definitely not lacking.  They even have a Chinese food menu for those in your party who prefer that.    It's only a 13 menu drive to the zoo and botanical garden for those looking for a meal close like we were.",

Delicate ribbons filled with flavorful pork and mushroom mix.    Flavorful Nuoc Cham and created the perfect balance of flavor.  I ordered the Banh Cuon Dac Biet and it was a diverse spread with Vietnamese ham, grilled pork and egg roll.  Unbelievable!  Topped with crispy fried shallots.  Egg roll was perfectly fried and filled with pork.  The flavor was spot on.  Not too many carrots!  I loved this place.  Best Vietnamese thus far!  I will be back for sure!  Vietnamese coffee was incredible and brought out in a French press!  YES!   The owners were so nice and helpful.  I felt at home.  I'm completely satisfied.",

It was easy to find and there is plenty of parking.   When we arrived we were quickly greeted, told to pick a table, and our menus were dropped off. Water was also brought out to us right away.  These employee was super attentive and he was friendly. We decided to order the happy family dish, one chicken pho, one plate of egg rolls, and we also got a Thai tea.   The food was made rather quickly and we were glad we don't have to wait that long. Our pho was delicious. The broth was great and piping hot when it was brought out. The happy family was also delicious! The vegetables were cooked perfectly and they weren't at all mushy! I hate mushy vegetables!  The egg rolls were our favorite as they were hot and crunchy. They are made out of pork so they were full of flavor!  We were checked on several times and our waters were always filled. You do pay up at the register when your all done!  We will definitely be back again when we're craving pho or some more of that happy family dish!",

That's why their menu pics date back to like 2006.   Coming to Khai Hoan was such a pleasant experience because they are the real deal pho in the area. Since Im from San Francisco and have a high expectation for viet food, I'm glad I drove away from Phoenix, just to eat here.   I ordered the steak, tripe, and meatball soup with shrimp spring rolls (which are only $3.95!). I plan to come back and try their bun bo hue and rice plates before I move back home. The service was very nice and friendly also.   Met the owners son and cracked a joke about Ali Wong and how real Asian establishments have you walk thru the crazy commotion of the back kitchen area just to use the bathroom. LOL. Loved it. Come to khai hoan! They know what they're doing",

I mostly come here for the Vietnamese dishes so I can't speak for the quality of the chinese items on the menu.  The pho here is great with a generous portion of noodles in my opinion. I have also tried the banh cuon and banh hoi and enjoyed both of them.   I believe this place is one of the better restaurants for pho in this part of town. Not going to be comparable to pho in orange county, CA but definitely great for Tempe, AZ.  I would recommend this place if you're in the mood for viet food around Tempe.",

The Pho was excellent, Crab Puffs good and the Spring Rolls very very OK, I would not order them again. Still love this place!

    "text": "My family was craving Vietnamese food but couldn't agree on what specific dish. Some wanted pho but others wanted rice.  Khai Hoan came to the rescue because they offer a large variety of different Vietnamese dishes. I had the pho tai but also shared some of my aunt's com tam dish with shrimp and pork. My brother had the banh hoi. Their pho was very delicious and the vegetable side dish that came with it was fresh. The com tam (broken rice) plate was decent but not the best I've ever had. I came on a Saturday night and it got pretty crowded. I also had cam vat, freshly squeezed orange juice,  and it was delicious but a bit on the sweet side. Like many Vietnamese restaurants, your drink comes out after your food. The pho noodles were a little on the overcooked side and were very expanded and soft. The meat to noodle ratio was perfect and the soup base was well balanced and not too bland or strong in anise and spice flavors. They do accept reservations. They do not serve alcohol. They also serve Chinese dishes like fried rice and stir-frys.  The owner was very personable and conversed with my family about where we came from and what brought us to the Tempe area. They offer catering as well!",

We have been coming here for about 1 year and a half, we enjoy each broth whether it is the pork/beef broth. I am not much of a meat person but, do enjoy eating #7 - Rare Beef & Beef Ball Rice Noodle Soup and the next excitement is I finally realized they have what we call \"Won Ton Mein!\" I never knew they had this here..hahaha! Sometimes, we have to drive to Vegas and go find our local 808 places to eat for \"Won Ton Mein\" and with egg noodles or sometimes, well just go to LeeLees and buy the ingredients to make won ton mein but, gosh thats like half my day.  So very excited to find it under #15 - Mi Hoahn Thanh Xa Xiu \"Won Ton & Pork egg noodle soup pork filled won ton\" so delicious.  Its not the same as how we make it but, hey its super close, I l also enjoy getting their fresh coconut water, love eating all the coconut meat inside,  and once in awhile Ill be dangerous and order there thai teas, not much of a sweet person but, its good and super strong!  The owner and the staff are very pleasant and sort of know us already when we walk in, they just get straight to our order, food comes out fairly quickly, and it just tastes sooo delicious.  AGAIN, not a fancy place but, just a whole in the wall thats been there for years cooking up some ono pho/chinese dishes.",

It wasn't terribly busy when I walked in and I grabbed a table and the young man grabbed two menus for me. My friend came in and he got us waters.   We ordered the shrimp spring rolls and egg rolls as appetizers, and didn't realize the egg rolls were pork until I bit in and realized there weren't just veggies inside. The server informed us that they don't have veggie egg rolls but said he could get us veggie spring rolls, which was nice. For drinks, I ordered a Thai tea with boba and my friend got a lemonade. The tea was just fine, it got watered down quickly and the boba had varying consistency.   For my entree, I got the chicken pho which was good, the bowl was huge but I managed to finish just about all of it. My friend got the rice vermicelli with shrimp cakes and liked it. I loved the spring rolls and the peanut sauce that came with was so delicious. When we asked for takeout boxes, I wanted a container for the sauce and the server said he'd just get me a new one. *cries tears of joy* I could drink this stuff it was that good.   We hung out for a while and didn't feel rushed to leave, even as the place cleared out by 4pm. Prices were fair for the food we received and it was filling as well. There's lots to choose from and there are lunch specials as well. We had really good service which helps and I'd go back.",

You will always see the same friendly family members there providing great tasty food and service. Inside is clean and cozy but simple. Gets busy really quick at lunch. On many of my visits there for lunch I see our hard working local law enforcement and fire fighters taking a break and enjoying a quick meal before they get back to work. Some of the tables are round and ready for a large group.  I love the Pho there. It is so much better than some of the others in town and is packed with flavor. It comes with a plate of bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos and some lime wedges. The table also has all the condiments you may want such as schricha, housin sauce, fish sauce, etc. The Glass and Egg Noodle Soups are fantastic as well. Try the Bun which is very tasty and is an Angle Hair Noodle dish with the meats of you choice topped with scallions, peanuts, fried shallots and served over chopped red lettuce, herbs, cucumbers, sprouts and yummy fish sauce. One of my favorites is a specialty dish call Pho Ap Chao and is a plate of fried Crispy Rice Noodle Cake with Shrimp, Crab, Beef and all sorts of Veggies covered in a delicious light brown garlic sauce. So good.  Everything is great here and they have too many dishes to explain them all. They also serve a large selection of Chinese food for those who are not in the mood for something different. Simply Outstanding!",

I went into the meal expecting big things but I was sadly disappointed.   The meal started off strong with good service and a friendly wait staff but took a turn for the worse as I got an opportunity to try the food. I ordered a bowl of steak pho and egg rolls which didn't take long.   The egg rolls were bland and after they delivered the food a saw a baby cockroach climb from under the plate. I knocked it off the table and stomped it on the ground. I got kinda queasy after this and didn't want to eat the soup but I powered through. The soup was big and had a lot of noodles but it lacked flavor even after the addition of the Thai basil, bean sprouts, fish sauce, Sirracha, and chili paste.  As I went to the front to pay I saw another baby roach on the wall. All in all 4 egg rolls and 1 bowl of pho and it totaled $17.98 which is way entirely to expensive for Vietnamese food.

The menu had a lot of items and we ordered the #1 Pho and the Bun Bo Hue. The Pho was kinda bland and the added meats were small. The Bun Bo Hue was a little better but not one of the better BBH that I have tried. All in all the meal was quick inexpensive 2 min from the ASU field and the service was good.",

Having read many of the reviews, I caught at least 3-4 other reviews saying there were cockroaches either on the wall or on the TABLE (I would DIE if the latter happened to me).   I understand it's a good place with good food, but I think they need to address this cockroach problem. I wanted to like it and make it my go-to Vietnamese place, but it's hard when I imagine cockroaches in the kitchen too (I just get the feeling that they KNOW they have this problem and they are not doing anything about it).  Also, I did not really like that the utensils were all hanging out at the table. I wasn't really sure how clean they were after being out there for God knows how long, and being exposed to God knows what!  Now with the food, I am not an expert on pho, but I did enjoy my chicken pho soup! However, I thought many of the chicken pieces were very tough to chew so that was annoying. We also got some yummy spring rolls.   In summary, I would say 3.5 stars for food, and 1 star for being dirty (I also caught a few yelp comments that complained about dirty lettuce or veggies).",

I always get the Pho Ga (chicken), and my boyfriend gets the large beef pho with everything in it. Out of all of the pho I've had in the valley, the broth and flavors are my favorite here.   I always find the staff to be quite pleasant and nice. Many times it's a full house, but we've NEVER had to wait for a seat despite that, because there's a lot of seating available to accommodate a steady/quick turnaround.    I of course would recommend this place. In fact, I have a photo of their business card in my phone so I can text it to my friends whenever they are looking for a place to go :) For the record, all of my friends that have gone have also loved it! ;)",

While we were waiting for our dinner my boyfriend killed a roach on the wall next to our table. My vegetarian pho had three pieces of fried tofu that tasted like they had been fried in week old oil.

Get #37 (Pork Chop Rice), it comes with pickled vegetables, shredded pork, something like a sausage patty, an egg cake, a pork chop and a side of fish sauce.  Here's a tip ask for a fried egg also which just goes great with the pork and rice.  -(so delicious)   I have been known to eat two meals a day here.

He chose one of the Banh Xeo (crepe) dishes with beef and veggies on the menu. We ordered what is now my favorite soft, rice noodle spring rolls with peanut sauce and a tasty Thai Iced Tea (Yes, I combined my Asian experience). THEN, my dish arrived with delicious sprouts and tasty marinated beef and veggies galore, all within two layers of amazing rice noodle crepes. It is hard to order anything else now! It was very fresh and came in a large portion, so come hungry! I have since also tried the pho, and it is also scrumptious and gives a lot of bang for the buck to satisfy any hearty appetite.

None of them stacks up to this place in terms of overall satisfaction(what usually lets the other places down is the lack of indoor decor and apparent uncleaniness). I usually order large Pho with everything and they usually get the broth flavor balanced and the meat sliced right in moderate sizes and in the right quality typical of good pho. There were readied condiment and fresh and clean vegetables to rebalance the flavor.  I also go for the \"com thumb\" which is  a good dry dish alternative when I'm not in the mood for soup.  The price is right on target for these items. I wouldn't want to say but they can probably get away with charging $.50 to $1 more per item (without pushing me to cook my own Pho) and people like me will still come because there are no other Vietnamese restaurant this overall good in Phoenix.  The outside doesn't look as good as the inside. The inside is well decor for a Pho place and clean. The service is average for Pho restaurant which means it's minimal.  The food reminds me of the many good Pho places in Westminster CA that I've eaten at. That is why I would take my folks here and drive further. We came around 930 am and lunch and we didn't have to wait long. They were fast in delivering the food even during lunch when it was packed.",

I first visited two weeks ago, and I have already been back three times since. For anyone who is less adventurous with food, their Chinese dish offerings are surprisingly delicious. My roommate is not a fan of Pho, but has gone with me three times to Khai Hoan because he loves their Kung Pao Beef. The Pho Tai Nam is my personal favorite.   One note: Make sure you take cash if you plan on spending less than $10 (which is easily possible, given that any Pho dish is less than $8). There is a restaurant policy that anything charged must be greater than $10. However, I highly suggest ordering the spring rolls along with any dish. You will spend the allotted minimum and come away more than satisfied.",

    "text": "Reasons you should eat here:  1 - You live in Tempe. 2 - You haven't had pho. 3 - You like pho. 4 - You are vegetarian and want to eat pho. 5 - You like bun. 6 - You like small restaurants where you'll get to know the owner.  When I used to live in Tempe I would go there often for pho, and I've introduced lots of my friends to pho for the first time here. Khai Hoan is home to the best pho you'll find in Tempe, hands down. So many places have opened up in the surrounding East Valley that Vietnamese is kind of becoming a PHOlooded market (ouch, that was rough), but I can say that it's got Tempe on lock without a doubt. The #5 is probably my favorite, but it might be a bit much for newbies, so go with the pho ga (chicken). Khai Hoan is also great because it is one of the few pho places, that I know of, that serve veggie pho (not in the pho section of the menu, but the veg section), and it is loaded with delicious vegetables! It's best to come during the evening if you want pho because the broth only gets better as the day goes on. Another great item on the menu is the bun. I feel that bun is way overlooked at Vietnamese places, but it's a great if you're not feeling soup; get it with the egg rolls on top! Lastly, the owner is awesome! I went in there so often that he basically already knew what I was going to order the second I walked in the door, and that's great service.",

I went to pick some up since my man had a sore throat and I knew it would make him feel better.  For $15 I got Chicken Pho, crab puffs and spring rolls. $15 dollars!  This fed myself, my man and his brother.  It was a Monday night, the place was packed but it still took only 10 minutes to get my food.  While I was waiting 2 of my friends walked in.  Winner winner chicken dinner!",

The build-your-own spring rolls are good too.  It's small and homey. Exactly what you would expect for a family owned restaurant. It's like having a meal in someone's home.

Pho Ga (chicken pho)-4 rich aromatic broth, slightly too salty- had to water it down when I hot home. 2. Pork Spring Rolls-1 The rice roll itself was very rubbery, the menu says grilled pork it seems like shaved pork thin and with no charred flavor at all.  These were also missing bean sprouts-only had lettuce, mint, and vermicelli noodle. 3. Lemonade-3 SWeeeeeet! If you have a sweet tooth you will love this. Get a Large. Overall I think its a good stop dine in for Pho. Just not amazing. The to go packaging melted and my soup was all inside the bag-so dine in. I was still able to save it by pouring it into a container to reheat.",

I had the chicken pho with extra veggies,  but requested it bun style--broth on the side. Call me crazy (the waiter certainly looked at me as such), but I wasn't in the mood to splash pho all over my nice dress...yet I still wanted to try the broth.   The pho came out piping hot. I was miffed by the absence of fresh basil and sprouts on the side. These essential veggies were fondly missed.   The chicken was tender but a tad dry.  Broccoli, carrots and bok choi--cooked to perfection.    I really like that the hoisin sauce has a thicker consistency than most pho restaurants.  It went perfect with Sriracha and lime.   The entire meal was very reasonable.  Next time I'm trying the spring rolls and some Chinese food.",

I am from the northwest and may be a little bit pickier than most Arizonans when it comes to Asian food and this is the best Vietnamese food I have had in the desert. I love the pho and I really enjoy their fresh spring rolls as well. I have had the beef and seafood and they are both fantastic as far as Pho goes.   My boyfriend ordered off the Chinese menu and said it was meh. Not impressed, so I wouldn't recommend it.

The dry noodles and rice dishes are generous portions, and very tasty.  Great ingredients in everything.  Make sure you get an order of spring rolls.  . .

At first sight I was a little weirded out as they looked (and felt) like *ahem* something you may find at the Le Castle Boutique, but that's just how spring rolls are (chef boyfriend says technically they are summer rolls, as spring rolls are fried). But they are TASTY. Peanut sauce, crunchy fresh veggies, fat shrimp. MMMMMMMM I want some right now.   Last, you MUST get the Vietnamese coffee! You brew it yourself in the cutest little contraption that drips right into a tiny glass of calorie-free sweetened condensed milk. It IS calorie free, right? RIGHT?! When it's done brewing you pour it over a cup of ice and it is DECADENT.   Go there. Now. And crave it every day thereafter.",

    "text": "I have tried this places multiple times before finally deciding to write a review. This is kind of mom and pop restaurant. It's small, but the decor is quite nice and neat, they even have a big fish tank right next to the cashier counter.  The service is fast and sufficient enough. We love the owner and his wife because they are way so nice and always greet us with firm handshakes and warm hugs.  About the food, so far I have tried #2 (Special House Pho), #15, #25, #55 and some other plates as well. I can say that the #2 House Pho I still my first option, everything else just doesn't fit with my taste. Also, #55 which is the rice cake place with grilled pork and pork roll sparks my interest, but the grilled pork is way too dry and lack of moist.   We will come back for the Pho because no where else can beat them around this area. It would be nice to sit down and have a bowl of hot soup during lunch time at this place.",

I mean I've been coming here since my ASU days, probably my longest standing relationship. I love that you can ask for Extra Large bowls!!! If you're adventurous, they have everything from tripe to pork blood in their pho soups. The egg rolls have the just right crunch for rolling up in lettuce to dip. One of the rare places that also carries good banh mi. I also love their rice plates, both the shrimp and pork are really good flavors of grilling.  If you rather be fancier, you can go to their sister location Cyclo, literally owned by one of the other sisters. I personally like the girl next door types so you can find me here.",

Because I love pho, but I'll eat anything I'll try out some bun gone, some eggrolls too Because I love pho, don't forget to add the sides I'll be alright, if you want me to be your guide (to Vietnamese food!)  Khai Hoan Restaurant has replaced one of my favorite Vietnamese restaurants in the valley!  Pretty bold statement, but this place deserves my love.  I brought the parents here for a meal and ordered some eggrolls to start.  Nice and crunchy with some hotsauce/fishsauce and bam!  It got me rolling.  I, of coursed ordered some Pho while my bro order the Bun Gone-- My Pho was pretty damn good, nice warm pungent broth and tender beef round eyes.  I love adding the sides of basil, bean sprouts, peppers, and lime -- the amount of mix really depends on how I feel that day.  Some of this and some of that; always a surprise to my palate!  The Bun Gone was freshly made since my bro had to wait for it, but boy was it worth it!  Freshly made flat noodles with ground & fried pork, mushrooms, with a side of eggrolls and Cha, a pork sausage.  Overall, one of the best I've tasted around the valley!  Nice soft noodles and the crunch of the eggrolls brought the texture, while the Cha and pork combinations gave this dish a protein punch!  Wow!  The service here is excellent, but the seating is limited so if you come during the dinner or lunch rush don't be surprised to sit next to a stranger or a new friend! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "While in the Phoenix area on business. I was in the mood for Vietnamese cuisine.  Yelp pointed me towards this restaurant.  Located close to Arizona State University.  The place is clean and they serve Chinese food as well. I only ordered the spring rolls (referred as summer rolls in other places) and the large bowl of beef pho, or as they call it \"The #1 super everything\"  Portion sizes are huge! I had a lot of pho in my bowl, my only problem was the the taste of the broth was very bland. The broth was a little underseaoned for my taste.  The spring rolls were a bit of a disappointment.  The seam or edge where they met when they closed the roll was hard. I shouldn't hear the crunch coming from the spring roll skin while biting down.  Overall, not a terrible place. If you're hungry and want to stuff yourself with food, in this regard this place will not disappoint.  If you're looking for more taste and flavor,  you might want to look elsewhere.   I will need to try the other dishes when I'm back next time. Maybe then I can give them a better rating",

    "text": "Khai Hoan is a strip mall Vietnamese restaurant in Tempe that feels oddly familiar, like that classmate's sibling you never knew in high school that added you on LinkedIn eight years later. Oddly. Familiar.   The restaurant was relatively empty in the middle of the week for lunch. It seemed like there weren't many nearby workplaces that generated lunch traffic; maybe Khai Hoan kills the delivery game.   The spring rolls were quite pleasant. Anytime I can dip a bunch of cellophane noodles into peanut sauce, I will. You can take that to the bank. I recently had some awful spring roll experiences with old taco lettuce, so Khai Hoan was refreshing.The vegetarian pho was fine. I'm wasn't loving the bok choy, but the broth was satisfying enough. The portions felt small, but Khai Hoan was otherwise affordable.   I might be spoiled by living in Houston, where Vietnamese is the most spoken language after English and Spanish. Khai Hoan reminded me of the first time I had Vietnamese food back in high school in Kansas City: If I didn't know what I liked, then I would default to liking the dish. The only thing is, I do know what I like these days.   I would come back and try other vegetarian dishes if I were in Tempe again.",

Fairly small restaurant which has a capacity of about 50; every seat was filled and there was a wait list. Service is quick but the noisiness prevented the waiter from properly hearing some of our order. The #1 Pho fulfilled its promise with many tasty ingredient; their word was \"everything\" but many was what they delivered. The veggies served with the mini noodle dish were fresh, crunchy and clean. All of the BBQ meats were delicious. I would come again and would recommend to others.  It holds it own compared to what I'm used to in San Francisco; if fact, it's better than some I've had there.",

I just happen to have a hankering for pho since it had just rained.  Rare event and rain causes me to think of comfort food, which pho definitely is up there on my list.    I come in, sat down, water served and barely glanced at the menu when I sh!t you not, the guy (I think he's also the owner) comes to my table and said something maybe like \"Ready?\" but it sounded more of a grunt.    I had just happened to look to see that the #7 was what I wanted.  I ordered rare beef pho with meatballs.  He then takes me menu right off my hands.  Um...I was going to take a look at the spring rolls, but ok, I guess I didn't really care for that.  I'll just sit here and sip my water, without a straw, which I would like if someone would come by.  I knew I wasn't coming here for service.  Why is it so rare to have good service in Vietnamese restaurants? It must be a tall order but at least smile dude.  I guess that's what I pay for.  And then a cockroach walked across my table!  Eeew!  I shoo'd it away with my napkin, looked around to see that no one paid attention.  Ok, I won't make a big deal.  I just want to eat and go back to work.  I noticed when I looked around that there was a couple in the corner looking across the room for service waiting for their bill.  They don't know you're supposed to pay at the register, without getting the bill first.  Then 2 guys seat at a table besides me.  They were handed their water and menu almost immediately after sitting down.  hmm prompt service....seconds later dude comes over to grunt.  He just sat them down.  One of the guys looked at the other and chuckles, he wasn't ready to order yet, they just were settling in.  OK it  was not my skewed perception, he really wants us in ready to order.  Then the roach came back around.  I'm done with this place.  yuck. The guy must've eyed them because once the guys put their heads up, boom there he was again, \"ready?\"  My pho came and I ate it quickly, hungry, don't want to think about it.  Pho was so bland and disappointing.  The bowl was small for $7.50.  Upset with the roach more than the horrible service and food.  Went up to register to pay and darted out of there, never to return.  In and out in about 10-15 minutes.",

And I'm from California.. little Saigon/Westminster area of orange county so I know what REAL pho tastes like. I ordered togo and was quite happy that they included everything I requested. Other places usually don't listen very well. They had the sate chili and the extra oil I requested on the side. The broth was quite flavorful compared to other pho broths I've had in Arizona. The meat was fresh and delicious. Everything was perfect. If you're looking for real, authentic pho in Tempe.. this is the place to go!!",

My husband ordered the spicy garlic chicken with rice. It wasn't spicy at all but it tasted good in comparison to my dish.  I ordered a rice noodle dish (#47) with beef, shrimp, crab, and vegetables. The noodles were horrible (Clumpy and Chewy), the sauce was horribly bland. I ended up dipping my  veggies in my husbands garlic sauce.   I left unsatisfied and now have a horrible stomach ache from the greasiness I called dinner.  Maybe I just don't get it but this isn't the first time I have had Vietnamese and to me its just not good.   Sorry",

    "text": "10 years ago, this place changed my life!!!  I attended ASU and graduated back in 2000.  During my senior year some of my Chinese friends and I (I'm Chinese too) decided to go eat pho @ Khai Hoan.  Up until then, I lived my life pho-less and oriented my dining experiences around a majority of the chain restaurants that are littered around the Phoenix.  I say \"litter\" because a majority of them really are rubbish...  I'll cover those in other Yelp review(s).  So we head over and I first notice that Khai Hoan doesn't have much street appeal and to be honest, before they revamped their interior within this past year, it wasn't that great looking on the inside either...   But I quickly found out, that doesn't matter ONE BIT.  This place rocks.  I'm no stranger to soup and initially thought this was a variation of a ramen soup meal but I was so wrong.  The broth packed an amount of flavor that would seem impossible to cram into a liquid that was so thin.  The meat was soft and I found myself inhaling the noodles and broth to make up for the nearly 20 years of NEVER HAVING PHO...     Since then, I've been making up for that injustice.  I've been having pho nearly once a week or sometimes even more often than that and have been going on a spree to convert my friends to being pho-fans.    :-)",

    "text": "It was a hot Friday morning.  I'm used to the San Diego mediterranean climate.  Strangely, I craved pho.  Was I homesick? Ricockulous.  T and I yelped it.  We filtered Kai Hoan out of the yelp masses, and off we went.  I stayed with my staple - a large bowl of #1, the combination special of pho.  I enjoyed it - except I couldn't place it why the broth flavor seemed to start strong and finish less so.   That's not to say, I didn't enjoy it, but it made me wonder.    T ordered banh cuon, which is like a steamed stuffed crepe.  I've never tried it.  I do know that Chinese versions usually serve a variation of this as part of dim sum.   From my experience, it's usually served at breakfast.  Yummay!   But T looked at it twice - it was served on a bed of lettuce.  Wet lettuce.  It seemed strange to have it served on wet lettuce. Maybe it was for looks, but she claims the moisture further moistened the banh cuon than needed.     When I'm home in San Diego, I'll try banh cuon.",

However, beef ball was good.  My guest had the bun bo hue.  It did not have pork sausage (cha lua) but instead has joint/tendons/beef meat.  She asked for just beef ball.  The broth was spicy but lack depth.  It did not taste a little sour and spicy as it should, it has strong fish sauce flavor.  Everything considered, the price is expensive for the quality/quantity.  The restaurant was nice and clean however.  I decided to try this restaurant due to many positive reviews, however, after eating there I wondered where other people taste are like due to their positive ratings.

Their fried rice is also quite tasty.   Prices are great for the quality of the food and the staff is friendly.

Service was quick and our food arrived within 15 minutes of our entering their establishment.  My daughter and I ordered the same item (pho with beef meatballs / $5.25 each) and Thai iced tea ($2.50 each).    The pho broth was so flavorful and fragrant!  I normally cannot finish a bowl of pho, but this time around, I piled on the veggies and inhaled the pho within 5 minutes LOL  The place is open 6 days a week, from 9am-9pm (closed Sundays).  The menu has a mix of Vietnamese and Chinese dishes, with prices ranging from $6.25 to $7.85 for their entrees.    I look forward to returning soon to try their goi cuon (spring rolls / $3.25), cha gio (fried egg rolls / $6.25), and the com tam dac biet (pork chop, beef, shredded pork, and steamed egg meatloaf over rice / $7.50).    I'm spoiled with the diversity and quality of restaurants in L.A., so I'm hunting around the PHX metro area to find quality Asian restaurants.    Anyone know of any Malaysian restaurants in the PHX metro area?",

    "text": "A sober Saturday night when all my friends were out drinking led me to this restaurant. 30 minutes on the train and a 5 minute walk and I was here. Upon walking in, I had high hopes.   Khai Hoan has the typical \"we aren't trying to impress anyone\" Vietnamese restaurant atmosphere. It was filled with a lot of Asian folks speaking their native tongue, unlike a lot of places full of whitey.  The woman who owns the place was very cordial and although her english was somewhat broken, she was tremendously helpful to me. A walk through the kitchen to wash my hands revealed how clean the place has to be kept. Obviously they wouldn't want anyone walking to the restroom and seeing a dirty kitchen. Hopes still high!  My bowl of bun came, #19 ($7.25) with egg rolls and pork, my usual bowl at any Vietnamese restaurant. Usually, the bowl is oversized, giving you room to mix up your ingredients once you put your favorite condiments on it. Unfortunately, the bowl was packed to the brim so I had to make some adjustments on how i eat the dish. As for taste, the overwhelming flavor of barbecue pork dominated everything in the bowl, which was a delicious flavor, but somewhat disappointing that I couldn't taste the sauce.  This restaurant is also in a pretty skeezy neighborhood. I'd forgotten how long it has been since I have encountered your run of the mill trailer park white crack/meth heads in public. They kind of scare me. I'd rather deal with a drunk bum anyday.   +2 for the service  -1 for the overwhelming taste of barbecue -1 for the awful neighborhood",

You can tell how authentic a Viet place is by the condiments when you order: the right kind of basil, mint leaves, and limes. This place has all that correct, and their fish sauce is perfectly seasoned: not too sweet like some faux-Viet places, and just the correct color/taste. I'm lucky that it's down the block from my new home, and I can run in whenever I want. The pho is right-on, with really tasty and rich broth, and I also love the noodle cakes with grilled beef.   Only complaint is that I find the price to  be slightly higher than what I'm used to in NYC (of all places!). But it's only about $1-3 off per entree, and I understand it may cost more to get their supplies to the desert.",
