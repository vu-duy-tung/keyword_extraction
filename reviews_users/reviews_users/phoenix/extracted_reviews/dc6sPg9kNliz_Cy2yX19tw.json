Sit at the bar, take the recommendations of whoever is working behind the counter, and order at least one Surfer.  You won't be disappointed.",

You practically have to tackle someone to get a drink, and it gets really tiresome looking around for your server to get a refill of ice tea, and nobody seems to care if you complain.  Why do I keep coming back??  The spicy tuna handroll is the best in town, the turkey salad is one of my favorites, and a chicken sandwich that is to die for.  As long as I stick with what I know I'm fine (though there are some inconsistencies.)  The place needs to be remodeled, and someone who works there has to pretend they give a damn about the food, service, or the customers in order for me to continue coming.",

Somehow, I managed to spend about $25 on my dinner there tonight, even with happy hour pricing.  I know, it's not so bad for sushi... but the service was extremely off, and the sushi was just meh.  I'd been before and I'm sure I'll go again, just with the expectations in check next time.  I shared an order of yellowtail sashimi, an I also had a seaweed salad (it was violet in color - have you ever seen that before?), a scallop handroll (generous in serving size but way too creamy for my liking), and an order of ikura.    We sat in the bar area... it was fine for a casual dinner with friends, but nothing fancy at all.  There are much better sushi places to choose from - even in AZ!",

This was the first night that I ordered anything other than \"The cold stuff\", and got a teriyaki bowl along with a few pieces of nigiri.  The bowl was great...but once again the big pieces of nigiri style sushi were fantastic.  I have been to Sushi Brokers (good), RA (also good) as well as Satori and a Stingray etc...  Quality wise, Shogun is the best.    BUT  And I love this...but the atmosphere is completely different than any of these other \"Trendy\" sushi choices.  There isnt a whole lot of ZEN floating around and I think that it used to be a Hibachi style grill in the past.  Still...the bar area is a completely non-pretentious, regular bar.  They also have a sushi bar in the center...but I have just stayed at the bar the two times that I have been there.  Both times I have made great friends up there and the bartender is on top of everything.  It's dimly lit and feels like a regular working class bar with the added gift of the best sushi I have had.   They definitely take their sushi seriously.  Thats a good thing...cause so do I!  See you soon!",

She also kept our water and iced tea filled up the entire time we were there.  Wait for the food was a bit on the long side, but it says on the menu to be prepared to wait up to 60 minutes. I wasn't bothered by this because it gave me a chance to spend some quality time with the Mom, and it sorta just flew by.  When the sushi came out, it was well worth the wait. Across the board, my mother and I agreed that, it was some of the best sushi we've ever had. We ordered 2 spicy tuna hand rolls (which were huge and stuffed with generous amounts of tuna). We also had the neon roll, a regular tuna roll, rainbow roll, salmon roll, and a soft-shell crab roll. By mistake, they also brought us an extra tuna roll. I pointed out to the server, and she let us have it for no charge.  We left nothing on our plates. Not even the pickled ginger.  I highly recommend this place.",

    "text": "When I first started going to Shogun years ago, we always went there for the happy hour which offered inexpensive sake and Japanese beer.  The actual happy hour sushi was okay but that wasn't why were were there because there were not many choices for (real sushi rolls).  As time has gone by this place has really gone down hill.  I find that the place keeps the temperature to high for a Japanese restaurant and it makes it seem like they are too cheap to run the A/C cooler.  The last several times I've been there I no longer order the sake and Japanese beer so the sushi is simply not that good.  Also, their choice of music at night, old hair band rock and roll is played too loudly and interrupts the ambiance of what should be an intimate setting for people to enjoy their food.  Last time we were there about one hour before closing and they already placed all the bar stools on the tables and the lights were out  in some parts of the restaurant.  It made the place look uninviting and dark.  The annoying rock was playing loudly on the speakers as if they were just cleaning up for the night but people were still coming in.  Not a fan but I tag along with my friends who like to go.",

Watched 4 people seat themselves at the area and clean their own table.  I got up at least 6 times asking when we could be seated - never got seated.  Informed the clueless excuse of a hostess that she was an idiot and left without eating.  Thanks for the great birthday experience!

Shogun can be found in the strip mall area of Paradise Valley - right off Tatum and next door to Sprout's Supermarket.  It is here where you will find delicious, affordable sushi, as well as other Japanese items.  Note that Shogun is truly one of the original sushi bars in Phoenix.  Entering Shogun you will view the restaurant is divided into three distinct areas:  bar, sushi bar, and dining room.  You can select whichever you prefer and can order from the same menu at each of the three areas.  The hostess is there waiting and greeting you at the door, along with a sign of their daily specials.  To enter Shogun, is to enter a diverse world of Japanese specialties.   My absolute favorite is their Shrimp and Vegetable Tempura - six Jumbo shrimp and fresh vegetables - just the right amount of crunch and big in size.  You will not go away hungry when having their Tempura special.  Ordering any of their sushi is always fresh and delicious.  Particular favorites are their California Roll (for those looking to ease into the sushi experience), or their Caterpillar Roll for those more versed in their sushi.  If you are looking for other entree options, their menu also boasts sandwiches, Donburi style of meal (selection of meats simmered and served over rice), or other entrees such as Teppan Chicken, or Samurai Steak.    Shogun Sushi Restaurant is a gem in the middle of the many delights Paradise Valley has to offer.  Be sure to stop by Shogun Sushi Restaurant today to take a walk off the beaten path of the regular dining establishments.  Area delivery to your home is also available!

Rob has been our family's dedicated waiter for over a year now. Every time we walk in, he knows us all by name and remembers our drink orders. (Because everything on the menu is so delicious, our food orders change too often to remember!)  The happy hour prices are the best I've found in the Phoenix area, and the quality of the fish isn't compromised. Best thing on the menu by far? The handrolls! Any flavor! They're humongous. Not like the measly ones served at other restaurants with a sad excuse for some fish and a ton of rice with a lonely stalk of cucumber. No, gigantic. It would be more accurate to say that these are almost as large as an ice cream cone. And they are filled with deliciousness.  I have been coming to Shogun for 8+ years and will continue to do so, as I always leave with a full belly and a happy heart.",

My boyfriend recently moved into the area and we are trying out some local places by the house and we were out shopping this past Saturday and decided to stop into Shogun for some sushi. We walked in and decided we would sit at the sushi bar since we wanted to be a little quick. We walked in and noticed about 3 people in the bar, 5 people at the sushi bar and 3 tables of people in the dinning area so it was not overly packed by any means. We proceeded to check in on yelp and wait, and wait and wait....I checked my yelp app to see when we checked in and it was 20 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order! The poor female server asked if the other male server had come over to us yet and we said no. It looked like he was only waiting on a family of 3 at the sushi bar and was overwhelmed. She clearly looked frustrated with him at this point I noticed. She took our drink order and we placed our sushi order on the bar and waited, and waited and waited again. I again checked to see how long we had been siting there since I had checked in and now we are going on 43 minutes and no food or the sushi chef hadn't even taken our sushi menu. We were going to give in another minute before just paying for our drinks and heading out to get something else. Well, right as we said that the sushi chef grabbed our selections. I had the Neon Roll and Sweet Shrimp, my boyfriend had the Las Vegas Roll and that was it. I received my Neon Roll about 10 minutes later and then shortly after my Sweet Shrimp and my boyfriend waited and waited for his roll. I finally asked where his roll was and it came out about 15 seconds later and it was cold. This roll should have been warm as it is deep fried with tempura batter. Once we were finished I took a look at my check in time and it was WELL over an hour! I think this is ridiculous for lunch for a restaurant that had less than 15 people in the entire place and us ordering 3 sushi items.   The food was very good but the service was horrible. I don't know if the quality of the food would override the poor service at this point. I know we will not be rushing back anytime soon and if we did we most likely would order take-out so we didn't have to deal with the bad service and EXTREMLEY long ticket times.",

Never has the staff acted impatiently, as we have experienced in other establishments.  A++",

I forgot how expensive they are. My husband ordered the turkey salad and I ordered 2 rolls - spicy yellowtail and the Shogun roll which is supposed to be spicy.  Everything we ordered was so bland that if I closed my eyes, I wouldn't had no idea what I was eating. Nothing was spicy, in fact I couldn't tell my 2 rolls apart in taste or appearance. The turkey salad was so bland, it tasted like hospital food.  My spicy bloody mary tasted like tomato juice and vodka.  That's it. We're out. Scratching Shogun off the list.",

It started out great until the first meal came out and after 10 min waiting for the rest of the dinners our friend went ahead and started their meal as it was getting cold. Patrons seated after us were close to finishing their meals before we could flag down the bartender because the waitress was busy else where. 30 min later we get the rest of the dinners. So much for enjoying dinner TOGETHER with friends.   The waitress then comes to let us know its on its way but would be happy to give us complimentary miso soup  really?  We had our $1 miso soup already so no thank you we would like our food.   Manager comes to our table and thought she was coming to address  the problem as I can see the bartender addressing it with the kitchen as it seemed the order was not placed for our rolls. No she asked if we needed drinks, ordered only for her to come back that they were out of armarreto . She had the alternate drink made and never came or addressed the issue.   Disappointed with the service! At that point the food was soured so cant review the food.",

So I make my way back, by the time I get there it's 6:30pm. I wait a few minutes and they give me my roll. I'm walking out the door and I realize they gave me another wrong roll  I go back in and again they are bey apologetic, and tell me they'll get me the right roll. 6:50pm and I finally get my roll I ordered at 5:10pm. I gave 2 stars because the girl at the front was very kind and apologized many times for the error. Just irritated that it took me 2 hours to get dinner :/ hopefully it tastes good...",

Food here is good and a fair price. Not the best sushi but good. Over riding all of this is the amazing ability of the staff to ignore you and lean on their elbows at the reception stand. Avoid eating in the dinning area at all costs. Update: the 25 cent beer in the bar costs $3.00 in the dinning room IN A PLASTIC CUP!  Frat house nights at Shogun!",

Ok fine we'll just eat what we have a move on...20 minutes went by... where's our  server????? Finally she resurfaced and we asked to split check again they could not handle in the slightest degree.Skipped splitting the check, poor girl couldn't handle it,said would take too long,there was 2 of US.....Waitress was slow and food was definitely not worth what adventure we just got done with.

This is a Japanese restaurant, they serve Japanese food and sushi.....am I right?????  So upon questioning the manager about this, her response was \"I'm so sorry\"  about 10 times.  When i eat pasta at an Italian restaurant do they charge me 5% extra for the pasta???  Not a way to run your business.  If you have to pay your sushi chefs extra, change your menu prices to reflect that.  I also found out that they charge you 15% extra when you take out.  Really?????

There are a lot of other places for sushi, including the grocery store that are better than this place.",

Lo and behold, their happy hour isn't on Fridays or Saturdays. Well, no big deal. We still sat in the bar area and chose some sushi. Our waitress was fairly attentive and happily agreed to have the sushi chef pick a roll for us in addition to the godzilla tail app, Alaskan roll, December 29th roll, and spicy tuna roll.   The godzilla tails were pretty good. Seemed thinner than I remember, but okay. The chef made us a roll that wasn't on the menu yet, which he called the Grease Lightening. It was surprisingly tasty and very light, which is lucky because the rest of our sushi was terrible. The Dec 29th roll was bland and very dry. I had to drench each piece in the eel sauce. The spicy tuna roll came out as a spicy yellowtail roll, but we didn't much care since I'm a big fan of yellowtail, however it wasn't spicy in the least-- and believe me, I have a low spice tolerance. Worst of all, the salmon in the Alaskan roll looked and tasted as if it had come out of a can. I could not believe how terrible it was. What a waste of fifty bucks.",

I may be wrong, but I thought you were supposed to also tell people verbally that money was added to the bill.  Regardless, I was told it's posted all over the place and they have different levels (5% if sitting at sushi bar).    I find this to be a little under-handed and I'm disappointed as I enjoyed the sushi, best we've had since moving to the area.

If you have ever cleaned a 16 yr old boy's room you can understand why I was exhausted and starving. While I do eat Sushi, playing around with fussy little pieces of raw fish turned into artwork isn't really my thing, so I ordered the Teppan Chicken. I was hungry but this enormous plate arrived with 2 chicken breasts on a bed of grilled noodles, salad, a raw carrot/radish slaw and a bowl of rice (after I had eaten the miso soup and cucumber salad). The chicken was perfectly cooked, very moist and infused with flavor from the sliced ginger on top. The grilled noodles were okay. I prefer them soft and squishy. The rice was perfect. As hungry as I was, I could only get through half of one of the chicken breasts. My husband is the sushi lover and he enjoyed the sushi and rolls that he selected. In fact, our whole group was happy with their choices and there was a lot of leftovers for the next day's lunches. The only complaint came from the kids who got plain seltzer instead of their Sprites. Service was good. We will continue to come back.",

I would say we were there for at least 30 mins before the food came out.  The restaurant had a few tables but with the staff, there shouldn't be any reason why the food would come late. It was not tasty at all.  My Ginger Chicken (can't remember the name of the dish but essentially that is what it was, Ginger Chicken) barely had any flavor, my mom's Beef Udon dish was very salty.  My dad's Unagi had a couple of pieces (not big pieces) but a huge bowl of rice, same as my daughter's shrimp dish.",

Shogun was the first sushi I ever tried back in 1999 when I moved to Arizona from Kansas. The sunshine roll is out of this world and I can never go without ordering the Godzilla tails. Twenty five cent beers on Monday and great deals if you sign up to get their emails. This trip I got $5 off my order of $20 or more.   I have tried a lot of sushi and even eaten tuna right off the boat on a couple of 10 day fishing trips in the Pacific I have taken, and Shogun is still my favorite.  If it's been awhile since you have been to one of the original sushi joints in Phoenix give it a try.",

It has a neighborhood feel to it, so it's not fancy, but its delicious and local and inviting. For sushi: yellowtail sashimi is always perfect here, the Surfer Roll will change your life, and their spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail rolls are in no way spicy, but are definitely delicious. Also a big fan of the crunchy roll, and this is the only place I've had an Alaskan roll that I actually liked.  If you aren't in the mood for sushi-- the chicken katsu here is perfect in every way, and the Godzilla tails are so good I once had a dream that I was eating them. My husband always gets the Mikan Toriniku (but with noodles instead of rice, even better) and swears by it. Top it all off at the end with a scoop of green tea ice cream.",

That didn't stop us from enjoying ourselves though. The sushi were made by Latino men, so it's not like your authentic Japanese sushi.

Cheaper than Sapporo, Ra & Ah-So but a little more expensive than your traditional mom & pop sushi.  I say if you want to be seen in your micro mini with your gel head boyfriend than head to one of the aforementioned places.  If you want good sushi in a comfortable & fun setting than I would suggest Shogun.  I have been going here for nearly 20 years, well before they bought out the other side and built the bar area.  The sushi bar is always the way to go as you can be in and out in 20 minutes.  They have a fun little patio for groups (when it's not 115 outside).  I'd much rather support this establishment that has been locally owned forever than head out to another cookie cutter sushi chain.",

    "text": "Dismal, abject, revolting.  These are words one would use to describe the contents of a garbage can, or a snuff film. You know nice, pleasant things that one would enjoy on a Sunday afternoon. Shogun however deserves none of this high praise. These words are a lofty goal by their standards.   I was so unfortunate to collide unwillingly with this place one Saturday for lunch and decided to order the unagi roll and the Panko Udon. I was expecting some common sense from the chef/wank they picked up off the street, but even hope fails occasionally in an explosion of misery. The unagi roll was horrible. The rice was not fully cooked, the contents were soggy and tasted old. The sushi would have been better if the chef had taken the ingredients, put them down his pants, sat on them for 5 minutes while riding a bull, and then vomited on the resulting creation. Later the Panko Udon arrived, and it was even worse. I understand that it was panko breaded and not a tempura batter, but still it was absolutely horrendous. They could not have overcooked the vegetables, shrimp, and fish more.  It was greasy, bland, insipid cooking that could not have been made better even if it were served with a diamond ring.  The store bought, cheap as you can find udon was undercooked and had the texture of noodles that had been sitting for about 30 minutes in a colander. These little beauties were served in a pool of horrific bottled tsuyu sauce that left a lingering chemical aftertaste that was just a delight to behold.  I would not eat here again even if my scrotum were stapled to a chair and I was chained to a table. I have to give this place one star too many because Yelp unfortunately has a one star minimum. I would even rate any fast food chain better than this place. I have had better airline food.  Cheers, Until then, get the beers in... Just not at Shogun.",

We were catching up and after a bit realized that ~15 minutes had elapsed since we sat down.  No menus, no 'can I get you a drink', nothing.  We sheepishly looked around for our host who was nowhere to be found.  There were some occupied tables, but I would not classify it as 'busy' by any means. I flagged down a sweaty waiter who said that everyone had called in sick and he was doing his best to keep up.  He brought us both iced tea, which we did not order nor did we really want.  Still no menus. After half an hour of sitting there Mr. Sweaty threw menus on our table and assured us he would be right back.  He kept this promise and took our orders.  Tick tock Clarice....

I am a huge fan of the Giant Turkey salad that they have been famous for many many years. I also love the Shogun chicken - sauteed chicken breast with Udon noodles, not oily at all. This place is like home for us. My kids consider it their favorite stop.The tempura is crisp and flavorful- no worry of dirty over used fryer oil. I don't need to be seen at trendy places- I just want consistent meals that I have grown to love. It is perfect for girls lunch out and the bar side is fun with all the upbeat 80's music. I used to go to the bar when it was a separate establishment called Paradise Lounge. I probably have been here over 100 times. I have been in a Chef in AZ for 25 years and I know good quality ingredients when I taste them. This is the place.",

The food has always been awesome, but the last three times I'd been here, the service was beyond abysmal.  One night I'd come in specifically to tie one on with a meal, but I could only manage to get the waitress's attention for three drinks.  Kinda ridiculous.  So I was pleasantly surprised on my last visit.  We were told the table would be 10-15 minutes; we were seated in five.  Iced tea and water never reached empty.  And the food was incredible, as always.  I'm not much of a fish-eater, so I can't reliably rate their sushi, but I've always loved what I've had here. The Chicken Katsu is also very good.  I hope the good service we experienced indicates a wholesale change and was not just an anomaly.  But after being this close to calling it quits on this place entirely (and I've been eating here for 15+ years), they redeemed themselves.  I really hope they keep it up.",

I don't think anyone in the kitchen is Japanese, and the cooks dont know how to prepare basic dishes, such as tempura.  If you order shrimp tempura (hi $$$), you will only get 2 medium size shrimps on your plate. I asked if this was a normal amount to find on the shrimp tempura entree - and was told \"yes only two\". The fried batter was oily and not crispy as one expects with tempura, and the vegetables inside were mushy and tasteless. Some of the pieces i could not even identify. The miso soup was tasty but room temperature. My chicken katsu was hard and dry, and I had to wait a long time to get a knife to cut it, as we could not find a server to help us. The service was poor. My friend enjoyed his eel sushi, but I did not sample that. I think there must be better Japanese places to eat. The place is often crowded - so I believe many patrons just don't know what good Japanese food should taste like! And the owners probably don't care about the poor quality as long as they get tourists who show up and pay their bill.",

This restaurant has gone through ups and downs and many changes of ownership, but still has some of the best sushi and japanese food in the city.  Try the Valentine Roll if you like tuna.  Try the spicy Godzilla Tails over rice or noodles if you like chicken.  It's a chill atmosphere.  But alas, I am gripped by nostalgia - it wasn't what it once was, but it'll do when you're craving a good donburi (rice bowl).",

Today I went for the lunch special and was very pleased with the portions and the price.  The Katsu chicken was crisp and not over cooked and the roll was right on target.   We usually feel like we've been well fed, well served and reasonably priced.  The fish is alway fresh, the sushi chefs always accommodating to create a special version of a standard roll and the wait staff kept our glasses filled.  I read some of the other reviews and feel that over the long run, some are off base - this is my perspective from over more than a few years of being a semi-regular dinner.",

I wanted to make it my neighborhood cheap sushi place (cuz its nice to have a cheap sushi place where they know you and you know that its not gonna be great but it'll do when you want sushi and dont wanna spend too much), but this ain't it....  First off, I have a thing about filling out the stupid fucking check sheets all cheap, shitty sushi bars want you to fill out. NUMBER ONE, THEY HAVE ALL THE NAMES THEY MADE UP OF ALL THE SHIT THEY MAKE BUT NO EXPLANATION OF WHAT THEY ARE! WHAT THE HELL IS A SUNSHINE ROLL ANYWAY? So, I sit down, introduce myself  with a smile and ask the name of the sushi guy. I explain that I'd rather just have him tell me whats fresh and explain what kinds of things I like and would he mind just taking care of if. Simple enough in a empty goddamn sushi bar right? NO!!!! He basically tells me, if you don't fill out my stupid fucking directions, I'm not smart enough to prepare you sushi.  Not wanting to be a complete butt hole and stand up, leave and go to Yasu where they have a clue (a decision I am now regretting) I smile, fill out the sheet and wait for what I expect, the same ol shit you get at every strip mall sushi bar in the country..... To cap it off, my girl and I had one cocktail each, a total of 2 nigiri orders and 4 rolls...... IT WAS $100 DOLLARS.... I HAVE NO PROBLEM SPENDING EVEN TWICE THAT MUCH. BUT FOR A CRAP VERSION OF STRIP MALL SUSHI??? NO WAY... THIS PLACE JUST BLOWS... NOT A JAPANESE GUY EXISTS WITHIN TWO BLOCKS OF THIS PLACE...THE CLOSEST JAPANESE GUY IS TWO BLOCKS AWAY AT YASU. HELL, THERE ISNT EVEN A KOREAN GUY IN THIS PLACE.... RIDICULOUS....",

The sushi didn't really taste all that great either.  I'm not a sushi snob - but after living on the west coast for several years, I can definitely recognize sushi that is below par.  So much for letting my mother (originally from the Midwest) pick the sushi place when I visited.  She chose it as a place where she could get a chicken salad.  If you want a chicken salad, I'm sure there are better places.  If you want sushi, definitely pick someplace else.",

Awful, and they should call this something else, like Sea Rings. Cap it all off with a floor manager who decided to change a baseball game to a hockey game without asking who might be watching the game.

Their turkey salad is also a must try but remember this, SHARE IT, it's HUGE! At least 3 people can share this salad. The wait time for your sushi is well worth it...trust me even though we just Yelped met.  Call the restaurant, they have a hidden special (maybe not hidden after this) - all you can eat sushi ONLY AT THE SUSHI BAR for $24.95, comes with other side dishes and dessert.

    "text": "Came here with a big group, that had a reservation. But they didn't seem to be expecting us at all.  I was lucky and didn't have to wait long for my drink.  But some members of the group ended up waiting nearly an hour for a water.  They took the orders after we had been there for a bit, and that was fine. Then it went downhill.  We waited for the food for nearly an hour, and then when it came out it was all jumbled together (people from the far right side of the tables food was on a plate with people on the far left side of the table, and so they'd have to pass it all around).  Additionally, there were many orders that didn't come out with the main round, and had to be requested once the mess was sorted out, only to wait another while for that.  Finally we go to pay.  They \"couldn't split the bills\" because they had \"too many tables\"... fine, whatever.  So, we end up spending about 15 minutes sorting out the nonsensical check into pieces, with gratuity included already, so you cannot deviate from the standard percentage.   I had chicken terriyaki, which was fine.  It was a massive serving, but 90% rice, 10% chicken and sauce.   So good for that meal, made poor leftovers and was overpriced for what was received.  At least the drinks were cheap.",

Like the other reviews the experience has been a little mixed.  The food is very good, the prices are very reasonable.  We have come across the blond kid, who I don't think is a stoner, he's just on \"the spectrum\" and really should not be the first person you meet coming into a restaurant.  He'll help you or answer questions, but you will have to work harder than you would expect talking to a server, and you might feel a little offended by his emotionally stunted responses.  Last night we went for dinner and had a great time, but had a front desk person, who got annoyed when we asked to sit at another table that wasn't right next to the kitchen.  But once seated, the food was excellent and came pretty quickly.  The new server we got was funny and very friendly, we gave her a good tip.  I feel the place has good potential, but the management needs to do a little more to get good people who want and like to be there, and teach them some consistency in what level of service their customers expect.",

    "text": "The absence of flaw in beauty is itself a flaw.  I was in Phoenix for 17 hours a couple of days ago.    It was a perfectly warm day outside, one of those beautiful early fall days in the desert when the sun bathes everything in clear, comforting sunlight.  It felt great just walking around Kierland Commons in the warm, late afternoon sunshine.   My friend chose her favorite sushi restaurant in Phoenix, Shogun, for dinner.  We got there fairly early and sat at the sushi bar.  Looking around, I noticed that I was the only Buddhahead in the restaurant (and I'm only half-Asian).  \"This can't be a good sign\", I thought.  Don't' get me wrong:  I don't believe that a restaurant operator's ethnicity must match the culinary heritage of the food he serves.  This can't be right.  Food, like human compassion and friendship, transcends race and ethnicity.    My friend ordered most of the items off the menu.  We started with a Sunshine Roll, which was heaping mounds of spicy tuna loaded onto a modified California Roll.  The sauce for the spicy tuna was heavily mayonnaise based, which was a bit odd.  It was different, but tasty and original.  The Wahoo Sashimi in ponzu sauce with sliced cucumbers was light and delicate.  Wahoo is ono in Hawaii and is a white fish that is mild and slightly sweet.  It went well with the citrus ponzu.    The Veggie Roll was odd in that the ingredients didn't blend together at all.  It consisted of cooked asparagus, some kind of weird takuan (pickled daikon radish) that was a bit bitter, kimpira gobou (burdock root), and shisou (mint leaf).  All the wasabi and gari in the world couldn't fix this roll.   We also had Shake Sushi (Salmon Sushi), Octopus Salad, and some edamame.  The sushi here was so far off the beaten path that the tastes were a bit off, they were almost uncomfortable to my palate.  But, it's good to try different styles of food in different settings.  Food doesn't have to be perfect, or authentic, to be enjoyable.",

The yellow tail roll suffered from the same, and we luckily were cautious enough not to try sashimi.  The miso soup was served barely like warm.  The tea was served barely luke warm. That was when we finally got service, which took a veritable eternity.  Tea refills?  Good luck on getting someone's attention for that.

We sit down, look over the menu and instantly notice that the place is super expensive, even for lunch.  Then my brother points out that everyone sitting down seems to be over the age of 50 and eating huge piles of colored salads.  I'm guessing this is the turkey salad.    My theory is that for the price everyone went for quantity.  We skipped the original plan for sushi and rolls because at $12 - $15 at lunch this place did not have the atmosphere or the token chefs to warrant those prices.  We decided to start easy and try the Panko Udon noodle soup with tempura.    My False expectation:  Thick udon noodles, in a nice translucent dark broth, with tiny green onion bits floating on top, paired with a plate of assorted vegetables covered in a light fluffy batter.  Add battered shrimp or fish depending on the place.  All this would then combine in my mouth into that great saliva generating Udon freshness that I have come to love.    It arrived...  -INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE-  The not even joking reality:  Placed in front of me was a white bowl of soy sauce with a pile of store bought rough spaghetti noodles.  Floating in this disappointment was a horror show of deep fried unrecognizable straight from the freezer bag vegetable shapes.  I say shapes because vegetables  usually have flavor which is the whole reason for including them in a dish, these could have been cardboard cutouts soaked in grease.  I wish I was joking about the soy sauce or the noodles.  It tasted like something a Home Ec student from Beverly Hills would have made first day of class.  -INSERT EXPLETIVE HERE AGAIN-  Well we didn't find the hidden camera and only got a few bites into the mess before giving up.  Here is the best part, the bus boy was not at all surprised when he picked up the plates mostly unfinished.  Weird wait staff aside, Shogun is absolutely hands down the worst Sushi place I have ever eaten at.  If you can't do Udon Soup don't put it on the menu.  They should be ashamed for taking that much money from innocent people who don't know what good sushi tastes like.  Avoid the disappointment and save yourself some money.  You're better off at East Wind 1 mile north at Thunderbird and Tatum.  Better yet head to over to Hiro Sushi at Shea and the 101, its absolutely worth the drive.  -INSERT FINAL EXPLETIVE HERE-",

The hostess was friendly, waiter funny and attentive, and other staff said goodbye to us as we left.  Had to have edamame to start of course, and for the first time ever at a Japanese restaurant, they were steaming hot and not over salted.  I had the salmon roll and a shrimp tempura roll. Tasty and fresh.  ---sorry but I'm not a fan of shashimi, so I stick to rolls.  Had another dish called \"Dragon Tails\" which was chicken stir fried in  a spicy, almost buffalo style hot sauce. Huge portion.  When I peaked at the other diners across the room every portion looked really big! I mean at least two if not three portions per serving.  Our entree was out a few minutes earlier than the sushi, the waiter came by a few times and kept us updated, but it seemed as if he knew the sushi would come out later so why not wait 5 min then turn out order in to the kitchen?  Nice yummy, hassle free lunch.  Thank you Shogun.",

The food is amazing,but my last visit (and it will be the last) was terrible.   We ordered appetizers for happy hour and a couple rolls.  I asked for one of the rolls on happy hour to be wrapped with cucumber. After he dropped the soup on my friend's lap he came back and said there would be an up-charge for the roll b/c \"It's a PIA roll. It's a pain in the ass roll.\" Um,what?! Once I figured out he was actually serious, I said it was fine because I figured it would be a couple dollars. WRONG! The up-charge was $8. He essentially made up for the soup he dropped and compensated. All that had to be done was peel a cucumber!  Not only did he overcharge for the roll, it was listed as PIA on the receipt!  How much more unprofessional can you get?! I can't get over how rude it was!   It's unfortunate that this experience and the prices have now turned me off after 12+years.",

Ambiance: it's pretty dark in the restaurant but they have nice big booths so it's pretty private and quiet between each table. They also have a sushi bar area.

The pricing is more than reasonable and you get nice sized sushi and not a little rinkydink roll. Miss soup was hot.

I see they expanded the restaurant, not too sure when that was done because it's been quit a few years since I've been here.   We were seated right away, despite how busy the restaurant was. The place was packed out which is always a good sign.  We started with some miso soup, flavorful, love how much tofu is actually added to the soup. I also ordered the sunomono salad which is also very good and flavorful. My wife insisted we ordered the godzilla tails, glad I listened! The Godzilla tails are white meat chicken strips lightly fried and sauteed in their house special hot sauce and topped with green onion. This appetizer is freaking amazing.  On to the sushi.  We ordered the Surfer Roll which is a spicy tuna roll which is topped off with cooked sauteed shrimp in a creamy sauce. Thumbs up all the way! We got the mama's roll too, their crab salad inside the roll is so good.  Rolls take time to come out but it's so worth the wait. Fresh ingredients, awesome staff. I'll for sure come back, after all, any restaurant that has been around for over 20+ years has to be good for a reason.",

    "text": "Came by here with a group of friends to celebrate a birthday.  Unfortunately, the service here is just lacking in most areas.  After we placed our food order, it was probably around 45 minutes before we received it.  When it came out, there was general confusion concerning what was being served, and who ordered what.  We spent five minutes trying to determine what kind of sushi order was being served - no one seemed to know.  In addition, after we ordered all of our food, we were told that they could not do any separate checks, which was pretty frustrating.  We ended up doing about 15 minutes worth of math ourselves to split up the tax and food orders on our bill so they could then take our figures and charge each card accordingly.  Normally, I wouldn't get too twisted up about this, but after waiting three quarters of an hour for food, I was not in the best of moods.  The food itself was actually pretty good, albeit a bit pricey.  I ordered the Salmon Teriyaki and it was pretty tasty.  Together with a plentiful amount of rice and a little side salad, I was quite satisfied.  However, it was not worth waiting the amount of time we did for it - not much is.  If I was considering food alone, I'd give this place much more kudos.  However, the service just ruined the experience for me.  I honestly couldn't wait to get out of there after we finally figured out the split check situation.",

I continue to have great dining experiences and always look forward to returning. The atmosphere is cozy, and the sushi is outstanding!! Crunchy Roll is by far the favorite, it's always the first thing I order. But, we are branching out a bit, and my wife ordered the Shogun Roll because she loves lemon, and I thought... it didn't sound that great, but I encouraged her to try it, well, to my surprise, it's Very interesting, very good! My step daughter ordered the Surfer Roll, that was very good too, but the Crunchy Roll is still King! Oh, and don't forget to order the Yakumi Apples for desert, they are out of this world!",

Our server Jenna was very sweet but the Chef / Manager Paco, ignored us ( first time we didn't tip sitting at the bar). Jenna even mentioned that he'd tell us about the 'secret menu', but he was not interested. He had his back to us and watched the Suns bball game instead. We left very bummed out, as it's our special monthly date night. Sushi was fair, ambiance was fair, and Paco's service was unfortunate. Oh well, there are many other sushi restaurants thank goodness!",

When they're on their game, the food is exceptional; when they're off, it can be pretty blah. Tempura is either perfectly crispy & hot (which is the usual experience), or lukewarm and soggy. Sashimi can be gorgeous or meh. Rolls are typically good. Fish is almost always super fresh. But... I swear it's next to impossible to get a glass of ice water without asking at least 2-3 times. However, I keep returning bc it's 1.5 miles from my house, their prices are pretty good, and I love the bartender, Jess. She immediately knows what I drink and eat; it's almost like I never need a menu. Besides her, though, the service here is sub par.  Pretty good HH (all night in bar area, 7 nights a week!), 25 cent drafts on Mondays, $2.50 (??) small sakes on Wednesdays.",

    "text": "I work near Shogun and usually end up going there for lunch multiple times a week.  The first time I went, I was unimpressed and didn't think I would return.  Since then, I have learned where the gems are in their menu and what items should be avoided so the menu items are kinda of hit and miss.  During lunch time (before 2:30pm) they have these amazing specials which help me afford a sushi lunch several times a week.  They have a sushi roll for half off and a combo (usually a roll and teriyaki chicken) for $7.  The rolls in the combo change from day to day and the half off roll is always different from the combo roll.  I usually bring a coworker and we share the an order of the half price roll, the special combo and order an extra bowl of rice.  This usually puts our sushi lunches at $14 together -- making lunch super affordable and always delicious.  Some favorite rolls include the vegas and the tuna crunch roll (especially the tuna crunch roll).  The soft shell crab hand roll is a favorite of a coworker of mine. I'm not fan of any of their rolls that have a tempora/spicy mayonnaise combo (the chimichanga roll comes to mind).  Those are usually too heavy to be enjoyable.  Overall, Shogun isn't amazingly different, but their sushi is good.  Their lunch specials are a steal and the waiter staff is nice and assertive.  I'd also like to note that their regular rice and teriyaki (or other prepared meat) bowls are huge, and are family sized as oppose to individual sized.",

The two brothers that have been making sushi there since it opened are very good at what they do.  Their rolls are inventive and generous.  It's not the best, but you can't beat the price either.  They serve crab with a \"K\" and that is ok with me.  If you order a soft shell crab handroll you will know what I mean..a humungous roll made with creamy krabmeat, but for 8 bucks, I am good with that.  The menu is sure to please most people, katsu, tempura etc...that is usually what I go for at Shogun, with a smattering of sushi rolls....it is what it is....a great value for Japanese food.",

I don't care for the Turkey salad which is slivers of turkey cold cut combined with shredded cabbage in a very boring salad dressing. Too bland!

I sat down and began to peruse the menu when I saw \"Ask server for bento box selection\". I asked the server and he looked at me as though I had grown a third eye. He told me they didn't have bento boxes.. I showed him the menu to which he said \"hmff that's weird\".   None of the lunch items on the menu struck my fancy so I ordered the lunch special. I got the chicken katsu, it was over fried, hard and dry. The accompanying mammas roll had an overwhelming mayo flavor. And guess what? It came in a bento box.   There are a ton of great sushi spots in this area so Shogun really needs to step it up to be in line with their competition. (Thank God for Yasu's!)",

Unfortunately, their udon dish that they used to have in a broth was no longer on the menu.  Our server barely spoke english so we had a language barrier and she kept insisting we order their udon dish that was stir fried.  Instead I ordered their garlic chicken dish with rice.  The chicken was OLD and you could tell it had been flash fried quite a few times.  It was rough and wouldn't even tear apart when I was trying to cut the chicken into smaller pieces.  I couldn't even finish my dish.  The husband had these pork cutlets that he said was way too sweet and extremely dry.  He, too, had a hard time cutting his pork.  We ordered our son the udon stir fry and he ate about 4 bites and said he was \"full\".  So about $50 later, we left hungry and irritated and swearing we'd never come back here again.  So sad.",

Much better sushi at Yasu Sushi Bistro near Target on Cactus.  That will be our last visit.",

    "text": "Ate here for lunch last weekend for the first time in over 8 years. I was happy to see that not much had changed, and the sushi was as delicious as ever! I was, however, disappointed in the available sushi lunch specials--I was so spoiled in NYC with all of the cheap sushi lunch spots everywhere!   The lunch menu here is seriously lacking in sushi, so I opted for a bento box which was huge (and cost about $13). I liked just about everything involved, and you get choices for each section of the box. You do get sushi with the bento box, but the selection is limited-either one roll (I got the spicy tuna, which actually had a lot more to it than just tuna-yum!) or two pieces of nigiri.   I also got teriyaki chicken, which was good but did not come with any rice...that was a bit unexpected, but because there's so much food in the bento box I didn't miss it. My friend ordered a side of it to go with hers and I don't think they charged us for it. For the \"salad\" option you can choose from sumunomo (probably butchered the spelling on that), turkey salad (sounds random but is actually really good), or seaweed salad (which I ordered). Seaweed was fresh and tasty, and the portion was definitely decent.  You can choose between shumai (shrimp dumplings), gyoza (pork dumplings) or something else that sounded calorie-bombish (I wanna say it was fried cheese? I didn't order it either way). My friend and I were steering clear of fried food so we got the shumai, which ended up being quite fried indeed! I haven't ever seen fried shumai, but I tried a small bite and it was decent but greasy.   I was glad that the small amount of sushi I had with lunch was as tasty and fresh as ever-I will definitely be back for more!",

I'll give it two stars due to average food and environment.   Btw everyone swears by the Godzilla tails which are just super small strips of chicken in what I liken to a buffalo sauce.

Truly.  Unfortunately, we now know that it affected the food brought out!! Ugh!! My boyfriend ordered the Lemon Chicken...I had a maguro and sake sushi..and a miso soup...Soup was water for sure with some tofu.  Sushi was not good, and chef didn't know how to make the rice stick together apparently...The lemon chicken on the other hand was nothing as the description on menu.  The serve was a huge bowl, of rice, with a handful of thin sliced chicken (we think) 2 pieces of Green pepper (was supposed to be sauteed but was raw) and two slices of avocado.  I tasted the chicken as bf said he thought it was dry...OMG!!! dry is not the word...it disinegrated in my hand.  No flavor of lemon present. We waited for server to come and ask how our meal was, so they could have the opportunity to make it right.  She disappeared.  Our waters were never refilled.  (we were there 90 minutes)  We were pretty disappointed...we waited for 20 minutes to be asked how our food was or to get check.  She was gone...So we walked to the front to get our check...The worst service and food ever!!!  Save your money and go ANYWHERE ELSE!  Oh, and not cheap.  Not expensive, but for this bad of food...It should be really cheap...",

Lately however, I noticed 5% surcharge on the sushi and sashimi items if one were to order from a table as opposed to from the sushi bar.    The question is, whether or not if there is extra cost involved in bringing the food from the kitchen versus bringing the food from the sushi bar. I cannot find any rationale or justification.  I am wondering if Shogun is prepared to accept the consequences of losing $60 or higher in revenue due to their wishes of collecting 5% extra.  To be fair, the sushi and sashimi items that were ordered were fresh, well cut according to Japanese tradition, and tasted good.",

I had the lunch chicken katsu and my wife had the lunch turkey salad and chicken katsu combo.  The meal came out in a timely manner and the food was hot and good.  Our chicken katsu was cooked well - juicy and not dry.  When I eat Japanese and Chinese, I tend to drink a lot of hot tea.  Our waiter did an excellent job of refilling my hot tea on a regular basis so my tea cup was never empty for more than just a few minutes (if it got empty at all).  Con:  When we arrived, we saw a lunch special on the board - Tempura combo with spicy yellowtail roll for $7.  My wife thought about getting this but we noticed that if you order sushi in the dining room, there is a surcharge.  I know it's not much, but the principal of offering a lunch special that includes a sushi roll and then tacking on a surcharge seems stupid.  Not sure why they feel the need to apply a surcharge for sushi ordered in the dinning room when this is a sushi restaurant.",

Sushi is very pricey for lunch as there are no \"lunch combinations\" as other sushi bars. On line menu lists a sushi/roll combo for $15 but no longer available on printed menu.  The nigiri is made in very large portions (not bite size) so definitely worth the price. Turkey salad is all shredded cabbage with 4 tiny strips of cubed turkey breast that where very hard to find. Bento box and bowls are the best value along with one rotating lunch special, all in the $11 to 14 range.  Service was slow at noon Thursday when restaurant nearly empty; service improved by 12:45 when restaurant was half full.  Not sure why as there seemed to be plenty of servers and chefs.

    "text": "Honestly the worst service I've ever experienced in my life. The food itself was good but wow I've never been more disappointed. Our waiter (mel) made it seem like we were bothering her by eating there. My girlfriend asked a question about the udon noodles and her response was \"their noodles how else would you like me to explain them\". Body language was awful the entire time. Didn't check on us once. Once we finished our food we had to wait 30+ minutes for the check after asking for it. If you want to build a business and want people to come back you should probably hire people that at least can act like they want you there and at least try to have good customer service. Won't be back and wouldn't recommend to anyone.",

When is the last time your server argues with you? With poor service and better food choices elsewhere, I would suggest you seek your culinary experience at a place you are valued.",

We always tend to sit in the bar for happy hour and this time Annalise was serving us. She did a great job on waiting on us and kept checking on us to make sure everything was tasting good. As many times as we've been here we've never had someone with this great of an attitude and she always kept a smile. Glad to see the service is improving. Will be coming back!",

There was a separate bar area with multiple TV's showing the Monday night football game, and even some TV's in the dining area. It was busy which is always a good sign! Overall our sushi was pretty good. Your typical rolls were on the menu, along with some specialty rolls. Prices were decent too.  The best part of the night was their happy hour, 25 cent tap beers. Can't beat that!! I'm not sure what HH specials they run other nights, but Monday nights are definitely a winner with us.",

    "text": "Some friends and I were meeting up for sushi and this place was one of the closest sushi places to their house so we decided to stop by.  It was fairly busy when we showed up but we were seated right away which was nice.  Half of our party (the guys) were going to be showing up a little later but we went ahead and ordered some drinks and appetizers to tide us over until they showed up.  The waitress was nice if somewhat lacking in her knowledge of the menu but we didn't really mind.  After getting our appetizers and initial drinks we really didn't see our waitress, well actually let me rephrase that, we saw her at other tables around us just not at ours.  Now, I understand that we had told her we were going to wait to order until our party shows up so it's not like we expected her to show up and take our whole order, but she wasn't even coming around to fill our water glasses or to check and see if we needed refills.  Once the guys showed up and we ordered the food came out and I was kind of underwhelmed.  None of it was bad but it was all pretty average.  The only thing memorable were the Panko Breaded Onion Rings which were fantastic.  Honestly I would go just for those babies.  As for the sushi I may try a different roll and see if that made a difference and I would definitely hope for a server who's a little more attentive.",

    "text": "EXPENSIVE......This place used to be a regular visit when ever I came through Phoenix. I was shocked to see the high prices on my most recent and what will be my last visit. To put things into perspective, they are charging $35 for a Sashimi dinner. Matsuisa in LA , one of the highest rated sushi restaurants in the country, charges $36 and can justify that price. The sashimi I did try was cold and had not been properly thawed. If you are going to up the prices at least understand that sushi needs to be served at room temperature. Overall a frustrating experience. $9.50 for a basic spicy tuna roll.....I could go on and on about the new inflated prices.   Not sure if they are under new management , but they are certainly going in the wrong direction. The section devoted to sandwiches was also surprising and indicative of some confusion in the kitchen. I have never seen teriyaki fish sandwiches and don't understand why they would need an entire section of the menu. My friend ordered a roll that came to the table covered in Chinese crispy wonton noodles....not impressed or tasty.   During our meal we heard what I suppose was one of the owners discussing new ideas for the decor....I was tempted to ask what happened. My advice would be to leave a good thing alone....the prices are outrageous and unjustified. I am sure there are better places in the area and I will certainly be looking for them on my next visit. Stay away.",

My friend and I ordered 3 rolls, and one of them was a Las Vegas roll which I had ordered. We received our first 2 rolls and I thought maybe she was going to bring out the Las Vegas next. She didn't, and once we had finished the 2 rolls of sushi, I asked the server if the Las Vegas roll was going to be out soon (thinking maybe she forgot). Sounding annoyed, she said, \"It's not even done yet! It like takes awhile to prepare.\" Okay, chill out; it was a simple question and there was no need to \"like\" seem so annoyed by it.   Other than that one small incident, the sushi was decent, nothing too special but it was good.",
