The boneless grilled chicken wings with the crazy-hot sauce (mix of BBQ and spicy) are great.  The gyro quesadilla with green tortilla (on-request) is excellent.  The specials created by Gidi are always the best choice. This place needs a pizza oven and a second patio without any people smoking -- and it would be perfect!",

    "text": "While we don't come too often, it's our trusted dinner spot- we have a general rule not to do the same restaurant twice, so that we keep getting new experiences, but the Hungry Monk gets a free pass at least once a month- it's solid food you can trust will taste great. If you only got to try one item- I would vote for their fresh, never frozen chicken tenders- they put all other restaurants to shame- I personally love them better than the chicken wings because they are meatier, juicier and over all  a better price for the product.  But of course, don't bother with wings or tenders if you're not up for the house blue cheese dressing- we're truly waiting for them to package it for sale separately- it's that good.  If you get to try a second item- please don't pass up on the gyro quesadilla.  It's SPECTACTULAR- the gyro lamb meat is tender and plentiful, combined with cheese, diced tomatoes and diced onion (I occasionally omit the onions) with a house made tzaziki sauce (I'm sure I butchered the spelling of that, sorry)- it's the genius combination of a delicious gyro with gooey cheese and tortilla.",

I got to try some stuff I've never had before and I was also pleased to see that they had plenty of offerings from local favorites San Tan and Four Peaks.  My favorite of the night was the Scorpion Amber from Mudshark Brewing  Co. in Lake Havasu City, AZ.  Who knew that there was a brewery in Lake Havasu?  I'll have to try and find that beer again some time.  The food was just OK, though.  Our table tried the edamame which came with an amazing sweet chili sauce but were horribly overcooked, the wings which were cooked well but not spicy enough, the street tacos which were tasty but not even close to being authentic, and the sweet potato fries.  The fries were the biggest disappointment since I usually love those so much.  These, however, seemed to lack flavor.  They weren't overly greasy but somehow all I could taste was the oil they were cooked in.  Our server was fantastic and everyone else working there seemed competent and friendly, too.  The cook even came out to say hello and see how we liked the food (this was prior to the fries so we said we liked it fine).  They seem to have a lot of regulars so I think we stood out as newbies.  But even the fellow customers we met at the community table were friendly.  Overall, a very pleasurable experience.  I am not really a big sports bar person but if when I do have occasion to visit on this will be my top choice of the options close to home.",

This place was pretty busy for lunch and had lots of big TVs so I could see sports scores in between business conversations. I love when a restaurant can draw a good lunch crowd because it lends you to want to come back be a part of the happy hour and night crowd, as well.   They have a lunch menu on the back, so be sure to check it out! I also saw they have board games for customers to play. That's a cool idea!",

The red pepper hummus appetizer lacked flavor- overall it was bland and a little depressing.   My Mediterranean veggie wrap magically transformed into a chicken wrap before it hit the table. I notified our waitress who fixed the problem but also let the \"wrong\" food sit on the table while the new food was fired. Once the correct order was brought out she removed the wrong food from the plate but left the side of sweet potato fries- which were not crispy or warm.

The food, on the other hand, was not delicious. Having moved to the area 6 months ago, we hoped to FINALLY find our go-to wing spot. We got wing-in spicy bbq (which were TINY with over-cooked, stale meat) and boneless honey-hot wings. THese were huge strips of white meat chicken and the sauce was tasty. Our table also got the chicken nachos, which were overpriced and had chili with a canned taste. The last item was the gyro plate. YUCK. The strips of meat were tough and extremely thick. I felt like I was eating dog food. To sum it up....beer and boneless wings=good.  Service and menu aside from boneless wings=\"meh.\" Go for 50 cent wing Wed.",

Tuesday's are Team Trivia at 7pm - yet another reason to drink on a weekday (as if I needed a reason)",

Just when he was about to dig in there is a 4 - 5 inch long hair draped over his tenders. He takes the initiative to not bring attention to himself and even asked to speak to the manager on the side and not at this table. The manager who was trying to avoid talking to a customer and who had long hair says what do you want me to do about it?  Then in a very nonchalant way says it it must have happened on the way to the table. mentions how he's been in the business for over 20 years. Then I asked if you have been in the business for 20 years why do you not know what you're supposed to do. why don't you ask do you want me to replace that for you and hey let's make your beer and a meal on me . I don't know about you but I'm so tired of people thinking their doing you a favor by  you eating in their restaurant.   Its called customer service and if you want to keep your business open then you treat your customers right how about that?   maybe I'm mad because I was just about to go in there and get my own chicken tenders but more so because you could do better long hair  manager",

The server seemed to need some adderall because every time some food was brought out something was missing. Took three tries for her to bring out some ranch for our fries.   The food was good but the fried jalapenos were almost in one ball leaving a chunk of batter. The gyros were nice but the one that supposedly had 50% more meat had the same as the regularly priced one.   The atmosphere was basic which would be fine if decent music was playing or just to have some sort of constant music. The station must have been changed at least three times and the volume was messed with every time.   Maybe the workers were still hung over from the night before or just ready to leave to start their weekend but it was a disappointing first trip here. Hopefully if I come around again it will improve.",

We went last night and the service was good but 2 people ordered burgers medium rare and they both came out well done even a little burnt. 1 of my children ordered dino chicken nuggets and they were burnt also.  My pita wrap was good and so were the homemade chips. So 2 times we have had burnt burgers.If you can't get burger right when a big portion of your menu is burgers and you send out clearly burnt chicken nuggets(which are frozen from costco), then someone in the kitchen is looking at the food as it is sent out. So I doubt we will be going back.",

Just thinking about the potential in that title makes me want them. They are exactly what one would expect that they are - nachos blanketed with cheese and the regular nacho supreme goodness, topped off with a generous helping of diced chicken tenders and buffalo sauce. It's a wonderfully sinful idea, but I felt like it could have been a bit better. I also got to try the gyro quesadilla. Again, this is one crazy sounding concoction that just seemed to fall a little bit short for me. Think of a cheese quesadilla with gyro meat in it served with a side of tzatziki, and there you have it. I will say that their beer selection is pretty fantastic. If I do ever go back here, it'll probably be for a happy hour.",

I had a gyro - think chunks of meat, but the tzatziki sauce was sour cream based - not yogurt based; and there was very little 'veg' and feta cheese on it.  It isn't all about the meat!  I know I am getting picky for a place that doesn't specialize in these dishes.  But if you put them on the menu, you should be doing them right. I wouldn't go back, truth be told.  There are just too many other places to try out than go back for mediocre food and service.",

It feels like \"Cheers\" to me...definitely a neighborhood hangout where everyone \"knows your name.\"  Whether I stop by for a beer or to watch a Coyotes game, it's a fun place to hangout. Bring friends...or make new ones. It's that inviting.  For me, I like the fact that the employees are super friendly and truly happy to see me walk through the doors. It's a very welcoming place. Service is warm and sincere---and excellent.   They have an eclectic variety of yummy food. Whether I'm hungry for a salad or a plate of fresh wings to accompany my craft beer, the food is really good. I love a good rice bowl--and theirs is dee-lish! The quesadillas are outstanding. Of course, they have typical bar food, or comfort food as I call it, but the quality and taste surpass what I've had elsewhere. You can get a burger and fries or a gyro with hand-carved meat---and dozens of other delicious options.  Something else that I like about it is that I met the owner on my first visit there. Jim--a nice, down to earth guy who loves sharing his penchant for craft beer! His presence adds to the \"friendly neighborhood restaurant\" atmosphere.   Bring friends, family or just yourself. Enjoy great food, craft beer (many that you won't find anywhere else) and the camaraderie of others who want to know your name.  I am a big fan!! Tell them Jackie sent you!!",

The only good thing in can say about this place is the beer selection.",

The wings were pretty tasty (try the \"Crazy\" Bbq), we want to try them grilled also. Liked the variety of ways you can order your wings, nice touch. We had a greek quesadilla too, it was good, meat was tender, but could be improved slightly (maybe add some feta cheese?) They have lots of TV's so we expect it to be a good place to watch some events. (No UFC though - too bad!) We were really impressed with the CRAFT BEER & the always rotating menu - keeps things fresh & us wanting to come back for more!! So far, I'm a fan!",

Every component in that dish  tasted like it was defrosted.  Screwing up rice takes effort, and even the rice wasn't that good.  Beer selection was good and I appreciated the menu describing the taste and rating of each beer.  The waitress was pretty nice, but none of that makes up for the lousy food.  My BF ordered the pulled pork sandwich and he said it was ok, but not great.  I guess you have to be a mammal meat eater to like it here.",

We've always had a good experience, and the extensive, rotating brew selection keeps the venue fresh.  I've been urging the owner to add at least ONE Pilsner to the IPA-heavy menu, and last night he delivered with a quintessential model: Munchener Spaten Pils! It was great.  Adding to the experience was the excellent food. Portions were generous and satisfying!. One member ordered the Fish & Onion Rings, and when it arrived, two others immediately ordered their own! I can't remember better fish (pollack here) or more perfect onion rings! Homemade potato chips were remarkable, and the fry cook definitely knows the craft! Diners have many options for sides w/ entrees, which is a generous touch. Only the cole slaw was a bit bland.   Service was friendly & generally good, but not attentive enough later in the meal. Thanks for separate checks, too.  I really look forward to returning for brews and to further explore the enticing menu!",

The service from John, Ashley and a few others have been great!  John knows our family by name and has made some great recommendations on drinks and food items.  My son is on a mission to try everything on the menu!  We have tried many items from buffalo wings, turkey burger, pulled pork sandwich, fall off the bone ribs, onion rings, sweet potato fries, gyro salad, quesadilla, chili, etc and have not had a bad meal yet!  The prices are very reasonable for what you get.  We love that we found a local go to spot for our family.  Advice: do not go on a big game night around 6pm, it gets packed!  Every other time we've gone, we were seated right away!  See  you soon, Hungry Monk!",

I've tried two things at the Monk and I wasn't awed. I've had the chicken street tacos and the shrimp street tacos. The first time I had the shrimp tacos, they were delicious! The second time, the shrimp wasn't fresh and was very fishy. I also tried my husband's sandwich once (don't remember which one) and it was just OK. I've heard from friends that their wings are very good so maybe I'll check those out next time.   Drinks: 5 Stars.  They have a excellent draft beer menu. Varied selection and it changes with every visit. While my husband is enjoying an IPA from Michigan, I can be enjoying a Porter from Colorado.",

My BF said his sandwich was great but my pulled pork was a bit dry. It did come with BBQ sauce so I used that to help the dryness. It wasn't overly loud and everyone seemed friendly. My only other reason, other than my dry pork, for the 3 star rating are the prices. Both of our sandwiches were $9.00 a piece and I think it's just a tad too high. $8.00 would have more fairly priced. Overall we were satisfied and would give them another try.",

Service was great too, the one time I was in a rush, our waitress got us in and out in a hurry. My new favorite dinner place :)",

They have fresh made pretzel sticks with a die for beer cheese dip but last time we were in there was just 1 tiny cup that only had enough dip for 2 out of the 4 pretzels. Minor gripe however, service is good, good is good, beers are great!  Again get the trippel, you won't be disappointed.",

The fried buffalo cauliflower was so yummy, as was the soup and veggie gyro. Some of the people we were with had wings, and they said they were pretty good as well.   The place loses a star for two reasons: one the air conditioner was on waaaay too low. The place was absolutely freezing. This may be good for those drinking and watching the game, but not so great for those just trying to enjoy a meal. Also, the food was a little slow coming out too.  Overall it was good, and may go back if I was ever in that area again.",

We ordered a round of beers and some chips and salsa. Another group came in after we had our beers and within a few minutes we saw them being served with chips and salsa. We suspected they should have been at our table but said nothing. Our beers were done and here comes Cole and asks if we want another round. We said sure and by the way what happened too our chips and salsa. Cole says rather curtly \" hey don't worry they'll be right out\". So a couple minutes go by and he comes out and says that he found out that our order went to the table next to us by mistake. We told him we knew that and that s why we asked about our order. So Cole disappears and never returns to our table until our beers are gone. We get another round and a chip refill and Cole disappears again. So our beers are gone and no Cole. We see him on the other side of the restaurant serving tables. I guess since we are in the bar area he must have forgotten us. So Cole finally shows up and we ask for our bill. Our friend leaves him cash and we have to wait on our card. Cole comes back and says \"Have a nice evening\" and as he walks away mutters\"asshole\" under his breath. I couldn't believe my ears. I almost wanted to confront him about it but just left.... without leaving him a dime. I have been going there for years on a regular basis. I will never be back.",

The ever changing craft beer menu is incredible and what caused places like Applebee's to vacate Chandler altogether. They just couldn't compete. The menu, in part originally created by my long time good friend and beer expert King James Swann, is a bit like my old hangout in Phoenix where he also worked, Hazelwoods 1st place. (They were known for their wings ;).       Upon permanently relocating to Chandler, the proximity to the Monk was actually part of my house buying decision. I have to have a good neighborhood bar close by. Its a must. I need wings! The owner Jim is a cool guy, the bartenders are all awesome and like friends. I love the regulars too. People often underestimate the importance of a good bartender/libation therapist. Plus theres like 57 TVs to watch sports on. Go Monk!",

I was expecting a Native New Yorker-type place so I was flustered when I saw the extensive beer list- I quickly ordered something the waitress just told me they were out of, then changed it to just a Blue Moon, then asked what stouts she recommended before settling on... a pear cider.  Then I sat and pouted as I read over all the other beers I should have ordered instead, daring not change my order yet again and confirm all suspicions that I'm a jackass.  Fortunately, the inner turmoil was quelled when the drinks came- the cider was excellent. The boyfriend and I ordered 10 wings, a burger for him, and a patty melt for me.  The wings were great- I never order boneless so was surprised to basically get chicken strips, but juicy nuggets of meat with a crisp, sauce-basted exterior works for me.  The boyfriend said his burger was great and I thought the patty melt was just about perfect.  My only complaint was that the grilled onions were just this side of raw, but it's not stopping my mouth from watering thinking about the leftovers currently sitting in my fridge.  His fries seemed average but my chips were great, though not hot which is nice for homemade.  10 wings, 2 beers, and 2 sandwiches came to just under $40 before tip, but this was a Saturday night with no specials, not the usual circumstances under which I frequent wing joints. Next time I'd try to go during a happy hour, but I can definitely see a next time.",

    "text": "My husband and I visited The Hungry Monk on a Saturday night. It was trivia night, so there was a woman announcing trivia questions/answers over the PA in between songs. If you weren't there to play trivia, it was kind of ruined the ambiance. We arrived before the trivia began, but didn't receive any info on how to play from the hostess or our server. We didn't really want to play, but it would have been nice to have been provided with the information, in case we did want to play.   The restaurant was pretty busy, maybe because it was trivia night. We waited for a couple minutes to be greeted by a hostess and finally be seated, then waited for a few more minutes for our server to make it to the table. I ordered the Pear Ale to drink and we each had water. The pear ale was good, but kind of pricey ($4.50 for 16oz), maybe I'm just used to ordering drinks during happy hour pricing. We ordered the fried mushrooms for an appetizer. My husband ordered the original gyro and I ordered the veggie pita. The soup/salad came out after about 10 minutes, before the appetizer. I ordered my salad with the balsamic vinaigrette dressing- it was oily and herb-y. Not very good, and I had to keep picking the herbs out of my teeth. My husband got the chili; he said it would have been better if they would have sprinkled some cheese on it. After we had almost finished our soup/salad, I asked the server if our appetizer was almost done- it then took another 10 minutes for the mushrooms to make it to the table. They were pretty good, but I honestly think the server forgot to put our appetizer order in, after waiting for so long, they really should have been COMP'ed. Our entrees were good, nothing too spectacular, but not bad. As we were finishing up our meal, they seated a party of 8 beside us, when there were only 6 chairs at the table. It kind of made us feel rushed out because there were a couple people standing near our table waiting for us to leave. I wouldn't go back on a night when they were doing trivia; I might consider checking them out during Happy Hour. Overall, the food was OK and the service was very slow.",

The spunky little thing came over to us and took our drink order. With as busy as they were she still had enough time to explain some beers to me and give me some great recommendations. We noticed the table next to us had an array of chicken tenders and sauces. We got their recommendation and ordered us some chicken tenders which I might add are only .99 a tender. They were great tasting, moist, and crunchy. I like that you can add \"heat\" to the tenders them self or to any of the sauces they have available. Then the meeting of the regulars began. What an amazing group of people we met there. Everyone was so friendly and so down to earth. I have found my new waterhole. Wednesday nights they have boneless chicken wings for .59 and Thursday .99 tenders and Trivia on Saturday!!!! LOVE THIS PLACE =)",

The server was so friendly and inquired if it was our first time there....I like that. She explained the concept and menu. The chicken tenders were huge and fresh not frozen. The beer I had (3 to be exact) were craft beers and ice cold n yummy..the way I like them. The server did all the right things and the owner Jim, stopped by our table to check on us....that is HUGE for me and shows a hands on owner that really cares for both his staff and customers. Seemed to be a lot of regulars that knew each other in the bar area..I like that too. I highly recommend this place....it is a chain but it it is run like and independent operation. Kudos to this place",

It came out with plain white rice, several small waterlogged thawed shrimp and little teriyaki sauce drizzled over it. It looked like something you would see at a prison if the cook serving 50 to life was trying to be creative and didn't have any other ingredients available to him. Terrible presentation. Terrible quality. Will never return here unless I just need alcohol or want to sit in a booth that has severely cracked plastic that tear my pants up. So gross. Would give it a zero of I could",

The first thing I noticed was that the music was EXTREMEMLY loud.  Because of this, everyone pretty much has to shout to be heard - By the time the place got busy, I could not wait to get out of there just so my ears could get a break!  The bar was clean & the service was fast.  I was a little disappointed with the \"happy hour\" drink prices - I was just drinking Coors LIght, and they were $3.25 apiece.  Happy hour was $1 off beer, so that means $4.25 for a Coors Light, normally - Yikes!  I moved to the dining area - The manager \"Mike\" was extremely helpful and friendly, but I think this is because he knew the other people I was seated with - Regardless, he was top notch in my book - Thank you, Mike.  The table I sat as was very wobbly - The staff made a comment that \"Yeah - That table's been broken for a while\", to which I thought \"Well, if you KNOW it's broken, why don't you fix it?\"  DUH!    A member of my party ordered boneless chicken wings, and they got bone-in by mistake - The problem was fixed, but it took a little bit of time.  I would not bring kids here because it is very loud, and it is really an \"adult\" place.  Everyone is screaming, the beer is flowing, smokers on the patio......Yeah - No - I would not bring kids here.  If the atmosphere was more comfortable, and if the prices were more reasonable, I would rate it higher.",

I tried the peanut, it was ok but not as good as the Crazy Sauce or the regular sauce. Even if you only eat the 1st 10 and fries it's a great deal. The french fries are really delicious perfectly crisp and slightly seasoned, really good. I don't really drink beer but my friend said they had a really good selection and ordered a couple. The service is pretty slow, not sure why but it took everything forever. We sat in the booth for a good 10 minutes before anyone brought us a menu and took our drink order. Just as long for everything else. So just keep in mind that you're going to be there awhile when you go.",

We could't hear each other from across our table and actually had to bend down and speak into one-another's ear to hear each other. My Fiance finally had to ask them to turn it down a bit, which they had no problem doing.   After that, it really wasn't a bad place. The bartender was very kind and skilled. She didn't over-pour or over-ice our drinks which is a big peeve of mine being a bartender myself.   The food is good or bad depending on who is working that day/night.

I went to the bar and sat next to a very nice couple who had come in to watch the Michigan game.  the game was on the bars main big screen TV.  About half time a guy came into the bar and immediately started being loud.  All of a sudden the TV changed to the Cubs game.  The couple immediately asked a man who appeared to be the manager/owner to change it back as they had come in early to the bar so they could watch the game.  The manager/owner agreed and the TV was changed back.  About 15 minutes into the 3rd quarter the loud guy who I witnessed have about 3 - 5 shots in a very short amount of time was now visibly drunk.  He turned around and started giving the nice couple a hard time and cussing at them because he wanted to see the Cubs on the big screen.  Mind you two other TV's closer to him were showing the Cub's game from about 7 feet away from him.  He wanted to know who the He*l they were and how much money had they spent in the place.  He continued to yell and cuss at the couple.  This was witnessed by several waitresses.  The bar manager/owner came out and spoke with the obviously DRUNK guy.  Not more than 20 minutes had passed when the DRUNK guy turned around and started to give the nice couple another hard time.  He yelled and cussed at them to leave.  Some of his friends also started yelling and cussing at the couple.  This was witnessed by the waitresses and the owner/manger who quickly came over and had ANOTHER discussion with the DRUNK guy.  He never kicked him out, or stuck up for the nice couple.  What a dump/sh*t hole of a place.  I hope he enjoys the drunks who were out of control, threatening and abusive.  You lost a customer for life!",

Finally got a another beer and then ordered two apps. The apps took another 20 minutes and the bsrtender had stopped by twice to tell me they would be out soon. The boneless wings were tough and not good the sauce was watery . the fried pickles were the only highlight . you get a good amount for the price. The bartender seemed nice but was to pre oquipied and there should have been another person working.",

The Monk was slow that day which made for quick service. The place was small but quaint and decorated like your average sports bar. Numerous TVs hung from the walls and we were able to see every game that was on.  We all ordered wings and some shareables and beer of course. Well the wings were nothing crazy pretty standard wings with the usual flavors that most sports bars offer, but wayyy better prices than that of a Buffalo Wild Wings for example. We ordered some different types of fries which were pretty standard but again great prices. The deep fried beer battered jalapenos similar to deep fried pickles but with a Jalapeno inside were very addicting!   The beer selection for such a small place did not let me down! Numerous beers on tap and in the bottle ranging from local breweries to out of state breweries and of course your standard domestics all for reasonable prices!  If you're looking for a new place to go in the Chandler area to watch your games and are tired of the usual chain sports bar try this place out!",

    "text": "This place is a gem for numerous reasons.  What an amazing beer selection!  They do something a bit differently that sets them a part from some other bars/pubs in the valley.  I think they rotate maybe 20-30% of their 30+ draft beers to bring in specialty and seasonal beers, all while keeping their best sellers (yes, they actually listen & pay attention to their customers, what a novel idea!) on draft so their patrons typically know where they can find their favorite beer and a smiling face serving it to them.  In my opinion, many bars/pubs rotate their draft beer selections far too much, which is ok for wanting to try something new every time, but what if I have a favorite like Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, Huss Scottsdale Blonde, anything made by McFate Brewing, Bell's Two Hearted IPA, etc?  I want to know I can find a certain beer there when stop in if only for a beer & some food or a few.  Fair prices, genuinely good customer service and the owners really seem to care that things are done right and patrons are happy.  They've also got a chef there that pairs foods with really interesting flavors together than just make the food come alive.  Wings are very solid, I do wish they had the option of smoking the wings...but that's just my preferred method.  This place is the church of bacon, they have weekly specials that usually involve some part of the tasty pig, and they do a great job on the pork.  Oh yeah, they buy so much high end beer, the distributors ensure this place gets all the good stuff..yes...specialty beers.  Love this place.",

My fiance and I stopped in a while ago around noon when he was getting new tires put on across the street, and had a couple of bloody Mary's, and those were very good too!

I don't always like having such chatty bartenders and feeling obligated to keep conversation. She reads people well, I can tell she knows when people want to talk and when others don't. So important! I love the Buffalo cauliflower here! It's so so good! It may sound a little different, but I promise it's so delicious! I enjoy sitting at the bar here. Everything has great prices as well.

    "text": "Let me start by saying that it truly pains me to write this review. See, this was our go to spot for a long time. The food was tasty and the beer selection was awesome. We even coined a nickname for the place: Chicken and Sauce (you know, cause of their delicious wings and sauces).   So, we decided we wanted some chicken and sauce one night and ordered grilled tenders with lemon pepper, fried tenders with lemon pepper/hot, a Caesar salad and the Greek salad. When boyfriend arrived home with it, we were both supremely disappointed. The grilled tenders BARELY had any lemon pepper on them (when we dined in, they were always nicely coated) and the fried tenders had next to no lemon pepper and a slight drizzle of sauce. My Greek salad came with the wrong dressing, weird pieces of what seemed to be shredded pork, apple slices and cauliflower. I have had that salad there numerous times, and never once did it come with any of that shizz. The Caesar was the only thing that didn't disappoint.  Now, I'm in the restaurant industry, so for me to call and say something is a HUGE deal. I called and spoke with a female manager, who was super apologetic and wanted to compensate us with a gift card for our next visit. I told her that I appreciated it, but that's not why I called, but she insisted. We ordered take out again about two weeks later with the same disappointment and figured maybe they just weren't great with take out.  Fast forward about a three weeks later and we decided to dine in. We both ordered some beverages, which were fine and then our salads came out. Unfortunately, we had no silverware and our server was nowhere to be found. To be fair, they seemed short staffed but we ended up waiting a good ten minutes before my boyfriend walked over to find some. Our food came out pretty quickly after that and it was better than our previous take out debacles. Our server came over once to check on us and when we were finished it took forever for us to get the check. There was no manager presence on the floor, and for the amount of patrons in there, it would have been nice for someone to have been helping out the two servers we saw running around.   It sucks, because we really did enjoy going there, but after three strikes we just decided we'd rather spend our dollars elsewhere.",

We then had to explain to her where the list of breweries was, and how that was different than the type.

We questioned how the cook and the bartender who served, \"Deandra\", did not see this, and recognize that the condition of the fish was unacceptable.  The wings were litteraly bathing in oil. It seemed as though it was some type of presentation technique, But, it was undesirable and should targeted for change immediately.  The burbon bbq burger, It was the most on par item of the set. However, there was a mismatch in the expectation of what medium represented. The onion ring on the burger was very small and the tomatoe was not ready to be served.

I love how casual this place is, and how friendly the staff AND patrons are. They are constantly changing the beer menu, and everyone who works there is pretty knowledgeable about their selection. They have good deals (like 3$ craft draft beers on wednesdays). I love how I can bring my dog to the bar and sit at the patio, they always bring out a big water bowl full of ice water for her too! The food is OK, nothing to freak out about.. but also nothing to complain about. Just wish they had some healthier/lighter options.. But it is pretty in line with typical bar food.",

    "text": "My new favorite wings place! I've been a fan of the Chandler Teakwoods wings, but these blow them away. On separate visits to The Hungry Monk, my wings were delicious and super crispy. This tells me that they are conscientious about the process by which they fry their wings to a perfect texture. Nothing disappoints me more than a soggy wing!  The other great thing about The Hungry Monk is the beer selection. I visited during Arizona Beer Week (February 19th - 26th, 2011) and was lucky enough to score a free pint glass and samples from San Diego's Ballast Point Brewing Company. The Ballast Point sampler of four beers I ordered were completely original, including a porter infused with coffee and vanilla and a Scottish strong ale aged in whiskey barrels. My buddies and I also indulged in some of The Hungry Monk's half-and-half draft beers which are mixes of their house beers on tap. The names are fun... when you mix half Rogue's Dead Guy Ale with half Stone Brewery's Arrogant Bastard, you get \"Dead Bastard\".  I cannot rave enough about the Thai Peanut sauced wings. Ordering them just \"hot\" (2 out of 4 on their spiciness scale) is plenty piquant to get your taste buds fired up. Not as big of a fan of the Cajun-spiced wing which, although flavorful, was a bit too salty for me.  And although I wouldn't mix these two beers deliberately, a stiff salute to whomever came up with the name for the half-n-half SanTan's Epicenter plus Deschute's Black Butte Porter: \"The J-Lo\". Epic booty indeed!",

You can see what style, the brewer and even the alcohol content of each beer before ordering.  We popped in on the 4th of July to grab a bite and a drink.  The Pub Pretzels were soft, and the mustard and cheese were a perfect compliment to the San Tan Epicenter I was drinking.    The chicken tenders were breaded and had that nice crunch, and with the addition of the honey hot wing sauce, were a real treat.  Despite being busy, and apparently low on staff, our service was fast and very friendly.   Misters kept the patio area pleasant, and we were able to hear the fireworks, even if we couldn't see them.",

My wife's Gyro was good the chips also good, my son had a grilled cheese which was good as well. I would give 3.5 stars if possible, one drawback i did not enjoy was the community tables we generally will not do booths because we need a high chair for our son and usually that could block servers or other people in general but at a community table i really dont want to hear other peoples conversations that i do not know when i am trying to speak to my wife and son. Beer selection was pretty good to, we may give another try",

Not your typical \"bar menu.\" They offer a wide variety of creative options, at very good prices. We split an order of wings, half a greek quesadilla, and a sandwich. The wings were unbelievable! The rest of our choices were good- and the side of fries were seasoned perfectly. Our service was amazing, too! We sat on the patio, which was pretty empty and I was concerned we'd be ignored or forgotten about...but we were checked on every 10 minutes or so, our food arrived quickly, and our server was incredibly friendly.   The Bad- we sat on the patio (our choice), which was very small. We did so to have some peace and quiet because the bar area was so loud when we walked in. However, people came out to smoke every 10 minutes or so. Which given the space, meant they were blowing smoke all around us.   All in all, I'd come back. This is a neighborhood spot with a good sized bar area. Not a place I'd pick for a cozy date night...but we'll definitely be back for the good eats.",

Cool thing was this spot just happened to be about two blocks from my cousins mom's place, so he could actually leave his kids (their grandkids) with them, walk over there for a pint on a Sunday or Saturday to watch a game, then walk back. He had no idea this spot was here, since I guess the last spot had a much more limited menu, and not nearly as many taps.   We visited with a group of 4, that swelled to 9 when word got out just how close this spot was to the family. It was a Sunday evening, so pretty sparse crowd, so we kind of had the run of the place (but we all had Monday off, so was cool for us) Sports bar, few T.V.s booths, not too much as far as Ambiance goes, no real swag or art work that stood out to me. Didnt try the food, but the tap selection was pretty decent, with some local brews on tap, west coast stuff from California (nothing special for me, but great for the locals) I was most interested in the Left Hand offerings, as they don't distribute to Cali.   The Bartender was friendly, and she had pretty good knowledge of the beers they had on tap. Great that the scene in Arizona is growing, welcome site.",

Look around and you see Football jersey folks yelling at the TV during a game, drinking Blue Moon and Dos Equis, chowing down copious amounts of wings, potato chips, burgers, and such.  Now they do have far more beers than usual, though their lengthy menu is a bit disingenuous with their inclusion of blended beers on the list (yes, they'll mix two beers for you, call it something, and put it on the list as another draft beer).  A place can call itself what it wants, but when it lays the bait for a certain demographic by having so many large TV's with obnoxiously loud volumes for sports, they've thereby placed themselves into a niche.  Parking was tough being adjacent to a Denny's, and no parking on west side of building.  Servers were friendly but not always there when needed.  Food and drink prices were high if you're paying normal prices, but the varying happy hour deals were decent deals.  Food wasn't bad, but wasn't great either.  Chips are served with warm BBQ sauce in styrofoam cups which I thought was odd, but maybe I'm being too judgmental, for it is a sports bar.  Overall middle of the road, 3 stars = \"Ok\".",

Now I understand zones and all of the like, but when you have two obviously upset people needing your attention... you should PROBABLY help them. Then, just as I'm about to say screw it and leave, our waitress returns! \"I'm sorry I was handling something in the back.\" YEAH RIGHT!

My bf calmly explained we had before and the manager YELLED some more about the other managers causing problems for him by doing such things.

Not that it didn't look fantastic. The Sloppy Fries look like something I could sleep in. The burgers were massive. And every table that had wings didn't talk until they were devoured. I'd say that was a positive.  Beer: GODS! Any place that keeps Arrogant Bastard on tap is going to get bonus points from me. But they've got a great tap selection of local craft brews and national favorites. Discriminating beer drinkers -- that would be me -- will not be disappointed.   I'll be back!",

And we were able to bring Max, our mini-Schnauzer), since we were staying at the Crowne Plaza San Marcos Resort). Then we went to the Hungry Monk for our dinner the following night. We sat outside on the patio. It was 102 outside by 8:30 but the misters were going strong. Ordered the shrimp bowl over steamed rice with Thai Peanut sauce (it was just ok). But my daughter loved the Gyro pita that she ordered. 4 stars for the friendly ambiance and for being dog-friendly.",

The wings we had were bone in and most seem fried then sauced so they are very crispy but not dried out. I loved the Thai Peanut sauce and will go back for that. My daughter had a burger and fries which was cooked right and tasted good. Our server was really busy- Tuesday's also apparently trivia night and the place was packed by the time we left. But the service was still excellent and our drinks were always full. Will be visiting again!",

Wanna eat inside because you dont like the smell of cigarette smoke? Too bad the smoke from the patio shoots inside everytime a waitress decides to leave the door open. Wanna sit in a booth? Good luck they all have holes and missing padding and shake and rock everytime you shift your weight. Wanna beer? Takes about 20 mins average for the waitress to put in your first drink, AT THE BAR, nevermind when youre sitting at a table. Wanna eat on the patio with your 7 pound dog like you did the two times before? Too bad the rules change per waitress. Doesnt matter that they seated you and got your drinks, you and your dog are gone! Want a waitress that will return to the table at least once before your food arrives, you know, incase you want another beer? Nope not gonna happen.   See all these complaints? I never once brought a single one of the them to the attention of the owner/manager. He was there when we were kicked off the patio and watched the whole thing go down. There reviews plummet week by week, sign of the times.",

She took our order right away and it was out in 10-15 minutes.  The manager came out and joked with us. Nice guy! The wait wasn't bad because the food was made fresh. I ordered the bone in wings: 5 medium buffalo and the 5 sweet BBQ. Wings tasted way better than they look as the homemade sauces are delicious, and wings are cooked just right. The seasoned wings were perfection! I'll compare to Jack in the Box/Arby's curly fries but better and healthier because they don't use the same ingredients as the fast food giants do. My friend loved his honey hot wings and the huge onion rings, too. He made a comment that he's going to be coming back a lot! We will definitely come back and use the punch card to get to a free meal. This place rocks!",

The sandwich is stacked with  smoked pulled pork, Applewood bacon & a thick slab of grilled ham. It is served on grilled sourdough. It also comes w/ a side of Freddie G's gourmet BBQ sauce. Apparently Freddie G is a local BBQ legend. It is tangy with a hint of sweet. The sandwich is awesome. It is pork personified and is worth whatever caloric bomb that detonates. The sauce is crucial as the pork three ways can be too salty, you need the contrast.   Great beer, great ambience, and great food.",

They pride themselves on their tap selections, but really there's little here that you can't find at your average 24/7 Walmart. When Rampant is your highest ABV beer, I don't think you have the right to put the word 'Monk' in your name.   The burger that I had was fine. The extremely porky sandwich that my brother had was fine. Everything was fine, but that's it.

I like that this place is not too big, but very comfortable and awesome atmosphere. They do have an awesome selection of beers and a good menu. It is bar food for sure, but delicious.   We both had an order of 10 bone in wings, regular buffalo and were nice and tangy, the way we like it. Next time I am going to try a little hotter. The wings were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, nice and hot on the inside. The ranch, DELICIOUS. Blue Cheese, good but not my favorite. I prefer other blends, but I know some people will like it. It's just my personal preference that I didn't enjoy it as much as others.   We also split their version of a pub salad. It was huge and perfect to It's split. Fresh ingredients! We enjoyed that very much.   I did not let our service affect our rating, but when we went, the server wasn't the most friendly. Was not warm and welcoming at all. Kinda rude in the beginning but he changed up his attitude and got better. Everyone has an off day so I don't want to let the service affect my rating because we WILL go back.   It is nice to have a \"hole the wall\" type bar close to home. We are not sports fans, but we like the people and atmosphere, beer and food. just overall a neat place and look forward to going back!",

Had 3 kids with me that ordered a soup, a bacon cheeseburger, and a sandwich. You would think its Hard to mess up a bacon burger but apparently it's not. The food was so bad, the kids refused to finish it. One child went to the bathroom and got sick from the soup. I wish I could say something positive but I just can't. Sorry. Just don't go here. You will be disappointed if getting anything other than beer.",

Happy hour wines at many places are hit or miss for decent quality.  We liked ours.  We were light eaters yesterday (July 9, 2014) so we only ordered the chips & salsa for $3 or $4 & the chicken quesadilla for $5.  The salsa is a wee bit spicy but we liked it.  We saw quite a few families with small children.  It looked like moms & dads just getting off work and taking the family out for a bite.  Just about every seat has numerous TVs to watch.  Usually, at least one of the TVs is audible but last night the volume controls must have been cranked down on all of them.  The table next to us looked like a young couple on their first date.  So, I would say that the crowd is pretty well represented demographically.  I do not recall what time Happy Hour begins but it ends at 7:00.    We travel a great deal and are always on the lookout for places where the locals frequent.  This is such a place.",

I have been going here for almost a year every week and I have to say the place has gone down the tubes. Since I'm not 21 yet I can't really enjoy the beer. I came for the food. They used to have good portions for a good price. The Quesadilla, gyro, and burger were the best, but over the last couple of months, they've jacked up there prices and have made the portions smaller. Also every time I've gotten the burger recently, I've had to send it back because they overcooked it. My dad ordered his medium and I ordered mine medium rare. They were both overcooked. This has happened multiple times. A lot of the servers are not as friendly. There not mean, they just don't seem to have the time of day to say \"hi, how are you?\". Also a lot of the new servers are barely 18 and have no knowledge of the beer menu if that's what your there for. Even though it's a bar,it can get really overcrowded and really loud. I wouldn't go here for dinner anymore because it's too crazy in there. Other than that, the only food that is still pretty good for the price is he gyro. Even that's getting expensive.",

This place had a ton of great brews, and a nifty laminated list with descriptions, alc%, and brew styles that made it easy to pick a perfect beer. However, the food was pretty sub par.  The wings were ok, but not the best.  The bleu burger was somehow salty and flavorless.  French fries we also nothing to write home about.  I thought maybe it was a busy night, and a small sample size for an impression.  The next day i picked up some fish and chips, and a Reuben for myself and my lover.  The fish was extremely bland and greasy.  The Rueben was equally unimpressive; Lots of meat but the rye bread didn't seem all too fresh and the onions were few and far between.  Nice atmosphere and helpful wait staff.  Even though the place was bumpin' on a Saturday night, all my drink/food requests were handled in a timely manner.  The staff great advice on which beers to indulge in.  Was also notified that the owner rotates beers on a somewhat weekly basis which is refreshing.  I will go back again, but i will lower my expectations for the food.",

The place had good amount of people for a Friday lunch, we were a group of 11 and were seated together. The place is a typical bar atmosphere with big screens, lot of booth seating and open bars.  We ordered the food, my first thought after looking at the menu was the steep high prices. The burgers were averaged around $12. I ordered some chicken wings and chicken quesadilla, The chicken wings, I went with garlic rub and they weren't that great. I was not very happy with the wings.  The chicken quesadilla had raw tomatoes inside and wasn't that good either. The service was awfully slow. I get it we were a group of 11 but getting the check and payment took forever too.  Overall not my kind of place, I might not come back. Food was definitely average for the prices they have. It's definitely on the expensive side.

After a long wait, we finally got OUR food.  We had the pretzels sticks for an app, their beer cheese is interesting and unique but pretty good.  Then we got the chicken strips, both grilled and fried, which were good and descent sized.  We also split a half order ( which was plenty) of the homemade kettle chips.    Would of gave four stars but the wait to get everything brought it down.  Maybe it was just a bad night!?!?",

I mean it's a rip off of a \"restaurant where the women are all servers and bartenders and where tank tops and tight fitting jeans, lots of blond pretty females type of establishment\".  Industrial sports type atmosphere. Burgers priced about $13 to $14 bucks but they were big. Blue cheese is obviously homemade or a good brand. Very chunky.  Chicken wings are it's draw but they are a bit expensive. I will say the boneless wings were decent size. The mustard hot sauce is very good.  Chicken strips 5 for $10 can be fried or grilled. I thought that was good thinking.  I want to say the chx strips seemed like the portion of two chicken breasts.  House made chips are the bomb. Served with a good bbq sauce.  The pulled pork-ham steak- bacon sandwich was meaty.  Good draught beer list with local beers.  All in all. Impressed and we will be back. We want to try reverse happy hour. Seems good.",

We've been coming here for over five years and it seems everyone in my office is here on most days.  Yeah, I know that Wild Chicken place at the Mall does some nice business too. But they cannot beat The Monks for flavor, price or size of their chicken tenders.   If you like heat, well The Monk has something called Nuclear. You got to try it. It will make your mouth water and make the top of your head perspire. Now that I just describe it, can you taste it?

Last time it was O.S.H.O's Blueberry beer and we walked out with some cool goods like beer pints and bling.

They had great beer specials that day and the restaurant was clean. The honey hot sauce is my favorite. This really is one of my favorite restaurants to eat at.   I was disappointed the second time we went, it was 8:30 and apparently they close at 9 during the summer. But the bartender didn't let us in. The open sign was still turned on and after she made us leave, she went to turn off the sign. So they turn away sales just to make sure they leave early. Less money in her pocket. So next time I go, I won't be sitting up at the bar because if that.",

Lots of drink specials and not just well drinks but also name brand Captain, 3 Olives, Jager and more. We ordered the fried pickles on the happy hour menu for $5. They were great probably the best fried pickles I've had. They were just right they never got soggy. They are cut long ways and flat. We did the all you can eat catfish and they give you two large fillets your basically getting an entire catfish. It was good they said it was Cajun but really it was no spicy at all. I enjoyed it. Now here is the rest 3 stars due to service. Our order came and that was it never did we get checked on for drinks or to place another order. The person went to the table next to us and never to us. It was very disappointing. If I ever go back I think I will sit at the bar and hope for a different experience.",

The food is pretty decent. The chicken is alway cooked well, the burgers and juicy, tots and onion rings never disappoint.

My dad had the ham and cheese sandwich on a pretzel bun and it was soooo good.  Finally, their beer selection is amazing and their staff is very knowledgeable. I am not a huge beer person myself, but I enjoyed some recommendations given to me, and was also very impressed to see several different types of cider on the menu as well (it was good to venture away from my typical strongbow).

    "text": "The day after the 100-year-flood we had recently I was watching the feed from a TV news helicopter and saw a parking lot that had turned into a giant swimming pool with a bunch of kids on boogie boards. I wondered where the heck this place was until the camera panned out and I caught a glimpse of the Travelling Monk truck. I didn't have to wait for the camera to pan out and confirm it was near Denny's and Hungry Monk to know where this mall was. This is when I realized the Hungry Monk was a landmark. In the month before this happened, Hungry Monk had become a dining and drinking landmark for me and my friends. Tuesdays and Saturdays are trivia nights and we've attended quite a few of those to play against dozens of other teams with raunchy, silly, risque, and downright funny names. I wouldn't say we've been here enough times to be called regulars but Marcie the bartender knows us and that means we come here often enough. Most of the real regulars hang out at the patio smoking cigs and coffin nails and we've never really ventured out that way. Have seen some bizarre stuff right at closing time at the bar - some guy in his 80's motorboating some woman a few decades younger than he was. Then another time some guy offered his girlfriend to some other guy he was bonding with over drinks. Good times, good times! I've tried most of their food and I usually stick with that massive Hungry Monk Trippel - with locally smoked pulled pork, smoked bacon, and a thick slab of grilled tavern ham and served on thick cut Texas Toast with a side of Freddy G's BBQ sauce. They don't give enough sauce for that though. Also the Monk's Ribs is actually pretty decent for bar food. And their gyros. Funny thing, one of my friends started talking to this guy with tattoos that works at Monk and asked him if he was the bouncer. Nope. Turned out he was the chef. LOL. Place gets pretty packed daily around dinner time but usually clears out before it gets late. These guys also have a TouchTunes jukebox but sometimes they have some crappy radio station turned on so you can't use it. Place closes at midnight most days or at 1 AM weekends. But the closing times are like stop signs in Nogales - mostly just suggestions. I've been there when last call ended up way past the regularly scheduled closing time. Their food is decent but if you're still hungry after they close there's always Denny's next door or Los Favoritos not too far away in the mall.",

It arrived more medium than anything. Both the burger and fries were decent, nothing to write home about. I was pretty tired, so I wasn't much in the mood for any beer.

Sauce was good but overpowered the delicate flavor of the grilled cauliflower and waaaayy  over-dressed.  Pulled pork---boooooring...something you could have gotten at Costco from the freezer section.  Bun/bread overpowered the pork and bbq sauce.  Coleslaw was needed to bring it up a notch was underseasoned and needed vinegar for \"pop\".  Fish and chips was the last item...well  it was probably the smallest order of greasy fish piled onto the largest pile of french fries we've ever seen.

The fried pickles were a little spicy for me, but I'm a baby when it comes to spicy foods lol. My friend loved his quesadilla.   The only downside is that their barstools are very uncomfortable after a few hours. I would recommend sitting in the regular seating section if you're planning on staying a while.   All in all this place was great and we'll definitely be back!",

I say sort of because I think its like bar food elevated to the next level. We had a large party and sampled  a wide variety of the menu items, and everyone thought they were great.  The beer menu is vast and impressive. The wait staff was knowledgeable about the beers and also made suggestions. We sample a few specialty shots as well and they were top notch.   I would give the Hungry Monk a full five stars, but the wait staff seemed a little frazzled by our party size and there were a couple of miscommunications as well.   Otherwise it was an outstanding and I wouldn't hesitate to go back!",

I chose hot buffalo and extra hot bbq. It seems they were not tossed in the sauce but rather put on top of it. No big deal really just another excuse to play with my food. I will go back to try other flavors. The restaurant/bar was nice and not too loud but I guess that is to be expected for a Sunday afternoon. They had local craft brews for $3 which was a bonus.",

It changes frequently which is nice because I get tired of drinking the same two or three IPAs. I've always thought the service seems fine. On Saturday nights it is generally very busy and I've always felt the service was attentive.  Their wings are my absolute favorite. I have eaten my way through their appetizer menu and it's all pretty godd. The wings, though, are amazing!! They are super crispy and flavorful. The Thai peanut, honey hot, and lemon pepper are all super tasty with fresh tasting sauces. The honey hot definitely uses real honey so it's not cloyingly sweet.   I'll actually be back his weekend to use my trivia winnings on some beer and wings!",

It's now \"The Hungry Monk\" but same ownership and, doesn't seem to have changed much as far as setup or menu (other than maybe less emphasis on wings?). But the service has definitely improved. And as I've previously noted, they have a great selection of beers, so upgrading them based on my last two visits.

We go every Tuesday night and Saturday night for trivia. Tonight it was made known to us (by the very friendly and nice GM) that other teams thought we were cheating! It's the first time I've been made to feel unwelcome in one of my favorite establishments in chandler and I'm really disappointed it's come to this. I come to eat great food, and have fun. Not to be made to feel unwelcome and accused of cheating on an unimportant game. Kudos to the GM for being so nice about it, but I'm really disappointed in the experience tonight. It may be a while before we come back. The only people that are to blame are the fellow patrons of the Hungry Monk. Relax and lighten up, people.  On the plus side, as I stated before, the food and beer are great, and the atmosphere (when no one is accusing you of cheating during a trivia game) is fun and pleasant. The staff are always attentive, and we've grown very fond of a few specific staff members.   Would have been five stars but I'm feeling really unwelcome there at the moment. Again, this is NO reflection of the staff or food, but rather all of you, my fellow patrons. You should be ashamed of yourselves.",

The fish here were all nicely fried and hot, from the inside, fresh and not dry, but very supple to the touch.  Well done !  Service was again top notch like the first time :)  I am however glad that, this time, I am very happy to say they deserve a 4 to 4 and 1/2 stars for their excellent service and great food.  I always come during lunch so I can't try their beers, but if the food and service is any indication, this place should be definitely good to visit :)",

I don't know if there are just too many people and not enough servers, but the service has been incredibly slow every time I've gone.  Different servers each time. Even though it is a group of us, they only ask one person if they want anything and dart off before anyone else can order.  Like I said, every time has been for trivia night, but if I can't get service to my table it makes it difficult to want to go back. Trivia is fun, but a lot of people on the patio have their iPads out and are cheating the system. Ruins the fun for everyone else. Tried the wings, were okay, a bit dry and lacking sauce.   The Good: Tuesday has $2 Mexican Bottles, Sweet potato fries are really good, I'll go back for those! :-) Also a great selection of draft beer.",

The dressing actually comes in container that you add on the pita so that it doesn't get soggy. The potato chips are fabulous and made right there on site.   The staff was friendly and quite prompt.

    "text": "I've been visiting Chandler lately to see some friends. Every time I find myself wishing I could break out of the corporatist food wasteland that is the greater Phoenix area. On a lark, I searched Yelp for a recommendation on wings, and The Hungry Monk (hereafter referred to as THM) came up as a suggestion. Boy, am I glad it did. This place is absolutely fantastic.  Pros:  The beer selection is top notch. As a Bay Area resident I am pretty spoiled with my access to craft brews; THM has got me covered. They even had one of my favorites on tap, Black Butte Porter. SCORE.  The wings were made fresh, perfectly fried, and sauced just right - not too much, not too little. The skin was crispy, the wings were huge, and the flavor was excellent. The Buffalo sauce at standard heat was just right - you know you're eating spice, but it's not pepper-spray-to-the-tonsils hot.  The service was excellent. Our server, Danielle, was friendly, attentive, and prompt.  A minor but very practical point: they put a roll of paper towels on the table that you might easily clean up after your wing consumption. Some people might think this is low-brow, but I disagree; I found it very convenient!  There are plenty of HDTVs mounted with sundry sportsball programming to entertain the lizard brain during consumption. Perhaps my biggest pet peeve about TVs in pubs is people who mount $1000 TVs and then show stretched SD signals on them; not THM! Everything was in crisp high definition.  I did not get on my knees and inspect the floor, but my general perception of the place is that it was very clean.  Pricing was slightly less than I'd expect to pay at a typical brewpub, though this might be a reflection of Bay Area vs. Arizona costs.  Cons:  I have wracked my brain looking for something - anything - I could classify as negative or disappointing about the place. I was able to come up with one: I found the roasted garlic wing sauce to be too mild in flavor. It wasn't bad, just bland.  Conclusion:  I have already decided I will be visiting this place at least once on each of my trips in the future. I highly recommend THM if you're in the area and looking for a good beer with good wings.",

I appreciate a bar with wings in it's name providing some vegetarian options.  One thing, although I LOVE the vegetarian notation, be consistent - I personally wouldn't order the cheese quesadilla because it doesn't have the notation.  It's vegetarian though, right?!?!?

It goes fast when they have it, as the taps rotate regularly to ensure fresh options from local and national brewers. The boneless wings are moist on the inside and crispy on the outside. The selection of sauces (lemon pepper is my addiction) will have you licking your fingers and counting your lucky stars. If you want to indulge, order the fried pickles--a Midwest favorite, like spears of salty, crispy goodness. There are plenty of healthier options such as salads, wraps and rice bowls. You won't be disappointed by the witty bartenders and warm service.",

I have never been wowed here in fact the last server we had actually got into a verbal attack with the mother in law because she had asked for a discount because the server forgot to put some of the food on the order and it came out 15 minutes after the rest. Her answer was well you ate it and this is a business. Sorry but really that is the worst answer I have ever heard. I will be back but will ask to be seated in another section.

We always sit at the bar and tiffany, martese and heather are all super nice and make sure to take care of us. There's one older guy that bar tends who is pretty rude so if we see he's working we just go somewhere else. So maybe I'd give the place four and a half stars because of him. But overall we love it.",

Now that I experienced it I am wondering if the other reviews are fakes.  I want to start out by saying that this place has the TRUE POTENTIAL of being great, Kudo's to the owner for putting together what appears to be a great place. Trouble is, the staff hired will KILL this place given enough time.   1) Went there for lunch 2) Sat ourselves down at a table 3) Waitress and staff all around but all looked like they were kind of pissed 4) Waited and waited and waited. Nothing. 5) Another couple walked in.  6) Still waiting for service. Nothing. 7) Waitress goes over to the people who just walked in and gets their order. 8) STILL WAITING. Nothing.  9) Food delivered to the couple that came in! 10) STILL NOTHING. NOT EVEN A HELLO!  ...screw this place. We got up and left. Time wasted...about 45 minutes.    Damn I was hungry too! Finally found a great little Greek place on Ray road. Service was incredible. Food was incredible.   So I am voting with my dollars now. This place... no votes. The new cool pace in Ray Rd... gets my vote every time.  I can see why the Monk is Hungry. He probably went during lunchtime.",

The fine print though:  The people rating this place 4 and 5 stars are here for the great beer selection, not the food.    My experience:  The beer selection, price, and quality is fantastic!  I love how they have the beers broken down in a list explaining everything about them so it's easy to make a good choice.  The beer I had was awesome!  4-5 stars for beer.  The food is just bar food.  Not bad, what you'd expect at a bar, just nothing special.  Bottom line: if you are coming for the beer and sports/TV, you'll love it!  If you don't drink or hate beer, you'll get medium quality bar food.  BTW, the service was great on a Saturday night we we went there.  Not packed, but a decent amount of people there.",

I hate to pull the race card, but it was evident that we were clearly not welcome as minorities. Must I comply or better yet alter my culture to make those around me feel comfortable? I'm deeply offended and call out to all Latinos to boycott establishments such as these. Let us not be oppressed, rather let us unite and fight against those who discriminate us who are different.",

The beers were alright..there were a few glasses that seemed like they had been sitting out a while. Overall, no complaints.  Gyro quesadilla was phenomenal. $7 for a HUGE plateful of greasy, all american food. Perfect combination with the beer!  most definitely heading back over there once my next beer craving kicks in!",

My wife ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita w/fries while I ordered the Bacon/Swiss burger w/fries also. Our lunch was cooked to order and served pipping hot! The fires are excellent. My burger was one of the best that I ever had! It was thick and cooked the way I like it. My wife reported that her Pita was also excellent. She had too many fires--no problem as I'll never pass up great fries. We highly recommend The Hungry Monk to all!",

The food is ok but the cooks really don't know what they are doing. I ordered the triple threat and got violently ill one night. Also, if you order a burger well done be prepared to send it back several times because they don't understand the meaning of your request. I sent it back twice and then ended up canceling it. The beer selection is above average and the all you can eat boneless wings are fantastic. Happy hours here are ok too.",

It's a great time!   The decor is not my bag. And I wasn't a fan of the food. In fact, the pretzel was just SO opposite of the menu description it was ironic and I laughed at it. I paid $6 for those frozen pretzels you get at Costco and that generic nacho cheese. The burger was ok. Veggies were fresh and it was cooked correctly but the bun was stale and dry. Ick. Seasoned fries were good.  Now the highlight of our evening was the draft selection. Very impressive. They have Dogfishhead! Yum!  Service was pretty good too. Our food came out really fast and our server answered our questions about the different types of brews, got us samples, and was very friendly.  Gosh I wish the food was better here. I wouldn't mind coming back for happy hour or just to drink.",

Did some lovely yelp research, and decided to check it out. Love this place!! Tv's everywhere. Bar and both seating area. Its not a normal loud bar..there were families eating here with younger kids also to even older couples getting their grub on. Okay so the bbbeeeerrrrrrr!!!! Huge list of drafts that change constantly also . I had never had do many choices of IPA's!! You can create your own beer sampler. I made an,ipa sampler of four beers( ok I lie we made two samplers each ) we tried everything that sounded good. The menu is nice as well...everything from fried pickles to hummus to fish n chips... I actually had all three of these items and finger licking good.  Check this place out...you will dig it if you dig variety in your beer!",

We've been coming here for years and even after moving 30 miles away we find every excuse to stop in, catch a football game, annually watch the Draft here, NBA finals, you name it.  We order the cajun dry rub wings (medium) a half order of sweet potato fries and thanks to Jim starting to carry our brand, we can now have our Titos's soda lime!   The owner is a man of the people once Corporate guy who took a risk on wanting to run a beer joint and now has a successful business, food truck and expanding this week.  He doesn't hesitate to mingle and make everyone feel like they're in his home and part of the family.   We'll be there soon for our monthly traditional get together with friends and 99 cent tenders special. Cajun of course. Hope Tiffany our favorite bartender is there but we can't go wrong.   Always fresh food and service with a smile. We love it so much we'll be checking out the Prescott AZ location opening this week with 2 stories I hear. Make this your neighborhood cheers bar and be sure to ask them to play the touch tunes for your selections and tailor the party to you. We do :) Like it, love it, can't get enough of it.",

Get it!!!!! I'm a local and regular here as it's right across the street from my house. I really like the gyro and gyro quesadilla, those are my go to's. Burgers are hit or miss but come out excellent when it's a hit!  It's when it's slammed, the cook can't seem to handle it well, we were served a completely burnt up burger one time and pretty much everything that came out was cold or overcooked. But, we have definitely have had good burgers here and they totally took care of us if something went wrong! Awesome management!  I stay away from the chicken strips or boneless wings(same thing). They are always dry, there has been countless times where we order them. It's to bad they are over cooked cause they could potentially be really awesome with all the sauces they have to offer. I recommend regular bone in wings.   Atmosphere is great, they always have a great variety of beers on tap. They do growler fills. Like I said. I come here often, I recommend",

So sure, I'm a nerd to, but an Ops nerd and I consider these other self professed nerds friends but when the waitress keeps bringing you said delicious IPAs and you are enjoying the vibe- remember Big Data and Big Beers do not go well together!

The wings are big and meaty and the beer selection is fantastic. There are nine sauce choices and each one can be ordered anywhere from mild to atomic. This is what really sets BWR apart from the competition...fully customizable wing heat...awesome!!! It is like my wing dreams have come True. There is also a full bar and a very large menu for those sad and deranged individuals who don't like wings.  I made the wing excursion with my gluttonous partners in crime Brian V. and Forest W. Here is what the three of us ordered:  50 wings...yeah, that's how we gluttons roll. 10 Original X-hot-the sauce is a very respectable buffalo sauce. Nice balance of vinegar and butter...the X-hot made it even better. It was wonderfully hot without being unpleasant. 10 Spicy BBQ X-hot-smokey, sweet, spicy and delicious. 10 Parmesan Garlic hot-garlicy, cheesy, salty, spicy, crispy and yummy. 10 Lemon Pepper hot-lemony, peppery, spicy 10 Crazy X-hot-a combination of spicy BBQ and Lemon Pepper-OMG amazing. These were my favorites.  We also ordered sloppy fries-these are chili cheese fries that arrive in a gigantic salad bowl. Yes, a gigantic wooden salad bowl bigger than your head...full of curly fries, chili, and cheese. In the pantheon of salad bowl novelties, this salad bowl full of fat-filled, artery clogging, amazement is second only to the flaming salad bowl full of booze at Bahooka.   We rounded out our ridiculous feast with three bloody marys (Saturdays only $2.50,) a pitcher of domestic beer (Saturdays $8,) and two Dogfish 90 Minute IPAs. To say we had to be rolled out of the place is no small exageration.  With it's fully customizable wings and behemoth bowls of sloppy fries BWR takes it's place among my top 5 wing restaurants.",

    "text": "It's always good to explore and pick up out of the comfort zone.  Our bartender M. was the jam.  Witty and informed with the brews on tap and gave us great suggestions for food.  We were meeting up with a friend and had a few beers and food.  They have a good mid week special of wings and beer which is always welcome and the selection of beers on tap are a good balance of full and sout to flavorful, aromatic and bitter.  I'll definately be back for the atmosphere space and overall really welcome first time impression.",

    "text": "I can't really review the beer selection because I don't drink, but I come here for wings quite often.  I usually get 10 original hot and 5 of some random flavor.  The wings are delicious, right level of heat for me, and out of the dozens of times I have been here I have never been disappointed.  With the recent break away from the franchise I have not seen a drop in quality of the food.  I think its actually improved.  The wait staff is always on top of my tea and gives me an extra glass of ice when its fresh brewed and still warm.  Awesome.",

    "text": "I stopped here to meet up with friends last Friday night. I was surprised that it ended up being right by one of my favorite gelato places and I never even knew.   It wasn't a bad spot. We had a pretty big crowd and weren't made to feel out of place or like we were a bother. The place is decent sized and pretty laid back, which can be great on a Friday.  I didn't order any food but it all looked fantastic. Had I been hungry I would've surely snatched up some of the wings.   I was fairly impressed with the tap. I'm typically pretty picky about my beer selection and what is on tap, and I don't expect much from this type of establishment. However, after having a bad day and noticing they had Leinenkugels Sunset Wheat on tap, my day got brighter and I was happy. Anywhere that has Leinie's on tap gets brownie points in my book.  I have to admit it struck me as odd that Nickelodeon was playing on one of the screens while I was there. I asked if we could have it switched and while they said yes, they never did.",

    "text": "Stopped by on a Friday night with a group of friends.  Mike, the manager, was very nice and accommodating.    Our servers were very nice and helpful - which was appreciated, because I really dislike having to \"flag down\" a server.  The wings were good.  If you're into hot & spicy wings, don't order the medium.  \"Hot\" is hot and then they have \"atomic\" which will burn your mouth and eyes before the plate hits the table.  Lots of choices, too.  Right now, they have 49cent wings on Tuesday, 49cent boneless on Wednesdays and 99cent chicken tenders on Thursday.  Happy Hour prices for appetizers and drinks also very appealing.  Probably not the best place for kiddos (although you could), it's actually the perfect location for a Friday night after a long week.   Lunches are good too.  They also have a nice patio area, which would probably be really nice during the cooler months.  There is lots of parking available, just be careful not to park in front of the restaurant next door as they will have your vehicle towed.  (It's posted too!)",
