    "text": "We went to House of Tricks on Saturday night.  It was our first visit.  We had a reservation and arrived on time.  Our table was ready within 5 minutes.  We asked for a table outside; the dining area (both indoors and out) is lovely.  Very comfortable.  Very romantic.  We were quite impressed.  Our waitress was friendly and kind but the service was incredibly slow, whether or not this was her fault was hard to tell.  We got seated at our table around 7:50 PM and our salads were not delivered to the table until 9 PM.  They did bring us extra bread at our request.  But waiting an hour for salads is pretty ridiculous.  They were fresh, beautiful and delicious.  We also ordered the soup of the day as well... potato soup which can be pretty ordinary.  It was amazing!!  Our entrees were served about 15 minutes later and we weren't disappointed.  The plates were lovely and every element on the plate was wonderful.    The food was fantastic.  Regardless of the slow service we will go back.  In particular the lunch menu looks really great.",

    "text": "I won a bid at silent auction for a $150 gift certificate to this place.  Located in Tempe and buried on the ASU Campus, this was not a restaurant that we'd normally stumble upon.  However, I am very happy that I bid on this even though I knew nothing about it...why?  Because the food here is fantastic!  Here's what we ordered:  Korean Style Baby Back Ribs, $14 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA#WDPYIOgCMIM-dJnKrKaMZA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hous...</a>  Yukon Gold Potato Gnocchi, King Mushroom, $23 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ#2MsbjsZvu2hO1yeon7slaQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hous...</a>  Grilled Filet w/Smoked Cheddar Bits, Asparagus, Cabernet Sauce, Crispy Onions, $36 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ#LoIz5HIBcKYZcdOsoL2CAQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hous...</a>  Grand Marnier Creme Brulee, $6.50 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ#exAY1Qtwhzc2LmQNZZxjFQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hous...</a>  Double Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon, $6.50 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/house-of-tricks-tempe?select=DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA#DquWbL5b-Xb625mfyM95SA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/hous...</a>  The Korean Style Baby Back Ribs were simply amazing!  The BBQ Sauce was sweet & tangy with just the right amount of Ginger.  Yum!  As everyone who knows me knows that I love Gnocchi....the Gnocchi here is delish.  The Grilled Filet was very good as well.  But the best part of dinner was the Dessert....  The Better Half had the Grand Marnier Creme Brulee, which I sampled and was very good.  However, the best of the best was the Double Chocolate Bacon Cake w/White Chocolate Butter Cream & Candied Bacon....yes, that's right Bacon lovers!  This Dessert delivers the goods on all levels.....it's Chocolatey, Sweet, and the Bacon adds a little salty/meaty goodness that causes your palette to jump for joy....my mouth is watering right now.  There were 3 things that kept me from giving this place 5 Stars:  1 - Parking.  It sucks.  Jockeying for position against ASU student parking plus the customers for this place and area businesses is not fun.  They should offer a valet service up front just for customers....I'd pay $5-$10 just to avoid the nonsense.  2 - Seating.  We were seated outside....not our preference, but the size of the interior of the restaurant is tiny and we were told the wait was long to sit inside.  They have a huge outdoor seating area with giant trees.  We were sat at a table for 2, the table was very small and the servers had trouble with space when we had a bottle of Wine, Appetizers, and Bread.  When then entrees came out, it was a circle jerk to rotate old plate off, etc.  The furniture is patio furniture and the pads of the seats are left out overnight, dusty.  There was a lot of bird shit on the wall next to where we were seated and fallen leaves all around us.....I was constantly worried about something dropping onto my food.  It was our decision to accept sitting outside, so it's on me.  If I come back, will definitely not sit outside, don't care how nice the weather is.    3 - Service.  It was so/so.  We had to flag our waiter down when we were ready to order Wine....a huge pet peeve of mine.  Also, had to flag him down to order our food and refill Wine and Water glasses.  I think the majority of the wait staff here are ASU students.....they look young and don't know how to provide proper service.  When we walked up, we didn't know where to go because the hostess stand is outside and isn't obvious....2 hostesses looked at us and didn't say \"Hi, how can we help you\" or anything at all.  It was only when we started to wander around the patio area that they said \"are you looking for someone?\"....LMAO, yes I'm trying to get seated in your restaurant!  Too bad because the food is outstanding.  I will give it another try and see how it goes now that I know about the things to avoid.  Return Factor - 75%",

Duck was undercooked and poorly seasoned. Bison meatloaf was dry. Cornish hen was over seasoned and drowned in sauce. Best meal was a filet that was cooked perfectly. This is what earns them 2 stars. Service and our table location were inadequate.  Disappointing place to celebrate a special event. Too many great eateries around to waste time on this establishment.",

We were seated outside, at our request, and nearly immediately noticed the construction going on across  the street. The lights were intense and glaring in our friend's face-this, of course, was not the restaurant's fault and our server, Sarah, offered to position the table umbrellas to block the light which did help. The night we went was a Thursday and the restaurant was busy but not terribly. Nonetheless, the service was quite slow. The food was very good, once received. I think we will hold off on returning until the construction in the area is completed.",

I arranged for a dozen attorneys to have dinner there as part of a dine-around for 200 attorneys during their annual members meeting.  We used a total of 16 local restaurants.  I dealt with Janis who responded to my emails quickly, and we set up a master bill for the evening.  Then, two days before the dine around, I called her to book another large group, this time the executive board, on the night before the dine-around.  Again, she was accommodating and understood my corporate billing needs.    Both groups gave their experience glowing reviews!  They not only commented on how delicious the food tasted and how well it was prepared, but they also had numerous compliments on the staff and the outstanding service.    Thank you to Janis and the the House of Tricks staff for taking good care of my clients.  I promise, if I get back to Phoenix, I will stop in for a meal and say thanks in person.",

For instance the beet salad with blue cheese.  How do you ruin that?  Boiling the beets into mush balls and putting a rock hard block of cheese next to it.  Some greens, no dressing but some sort of gelatinous goo on the side.  Fish with harissa?  There was a small dot of something hot on the side of the plate.  I had to put on my bifocals to see it.  Fish was taste-less.  Ditto for hsb duck dish. Not cheap either, $140 for dinner with 2 glasses of wine.  How this place is in business for 25 years would amaze me like an alien invasion if i didn't already have experience with this valley's dumbed down food.    Nice to sit outdooors but thanks I'll sit on my balcony and order something from Sal's or Marco's or someplace that puts some flavor in.",

    "text": "Foodie heaven - I love this restaurant!!  (March 7, 2017 update: visited again a few nights ago - there simply aren't enough stars to rate this restaurant - six stars on a five star scale. Every time there is something new and inventive - this last time they had a special soup [sorry I can't recall the name] that was a creamy, shredded meat literal orgasm of flavor - stunning - everyone at the table loved it.One of my favorite - scratch that - this is my all time favorite restaurant!)  Previous review: My fourth or fifth visit, excellent every time. Weather happened to be perfect, which made it even better. Service excellent, with informed waiter which is always a pleasure - knew every detail of every item, really got the impression that he had savored every item himself.  Myself and two guests. We started with the mixed green salad, which was simple and small but very fresh and tasty, a nice start. One had the salmon, which he said was very good. The other had the chicken and dumplings - forget everything you know about that dish, this is different (as-is everything at this restaurant!). First of all, I love traditional chicken and dumplings. However, here the chef has apparently cooked the chicken in the sauce, then out it comes and the plate is prepared with unusual but excellent dumplings, topped with a chicken confit, sauce and small vegetables - delicious.  I had the Pork Belly starter - decadence on a plate. The tastes were overwhelming, and the item plated beautifully. The waiter brought out a small glass of a sweet wine (I think it was  Muskat) and said I just had to try it with the pork. Sounded unusual, but he was right. I then had the Macadamia Nut Roasted Duck. Another hit. The crunch and flavor of the macadamia nuts made the the dish fun, the flavors were terrific. Topped with gingered cranberry, the tartness of which perfectly offset the sweetness of the coconut yam puree. On the side was a crisp bok choy, another flavor profile that added to the sensations. If you like duck, this is the bomb.  I love how the chef really plays with the presentations and tastes here; every time we've gone it's been a great experience, with fantastic food surprises and great service, in addition to the very pleasant and relaxing garden setting of the large outdoor seating area including outdoor bar.  Highly, *highly* recommended.",

This was a recommendation from a fellow yelper, and I am eternally grateful.   I might suggest changing the name to House of Treats which is exactly what happened to my palette with each bite I took.   The flavors and combinations were unique and delicious. Everything that everyone in our party ordered was devoured and thoroughly enjoyed. A fine dining experience. I have never had the opportunity to try ricotta black peppercorn grits ~ YUMMY.   I would love to return on a night when outdoor seating might be more completely enjoyed.   The only negative is the REALLY small size of the available indoor seating area. It could not accommodate a group larger than 5 people.",

It was packed even around 8pm (on Friday), but we got a table in the bar area. We wanted to start with shots of Jamison and were told they don't have shot glasses. So, yeah, it's that kind of place.  BUT...the food is DELICIOUS. I started with the kale salad and it was incredibly tasty. Very good flavors. They don't have many vegetarian options for entrees. In fact, I think they have just one, which I got: the gnocci. Thankfully, it was probably the best gnocci I've ever, ever had. I challenge you to try it and disagree.  The have a good list of cocktails (I enjoyed a Manhattan) and wines. They hide beers on their last page because, yeah, it's that kind of place ;)",

    "text": "Wow! We were recommended this restaurant for our one night stay in Tempe for my husbands birthday by a store clerk at Divaz Boutique (also fab!). We stayed at the Mission Palms and couldn't believe this restaurant was right across the street beyond a a shopping walkway tucked away in an intimate setting. First, we have to mention that our waiter Chris Coleman, was beyond phenomenal! Friendly,fun and highly professional, we wished we could always be served by him back in our hometown of Chicago. His menu recommendations were courteous and he really listened to us when we asked questions about certain dishes and his answers were genuine and helped us pick exactly what we needed. Now on to the setting and food!Since it was snowing back in Chicago we opted to sit in the beautiful outside terrace,duh. We were seated in a table for two next to the entrance facing the street  so intimate   that for a moment it felt like we were the only dinners that evening which was great. The food was literally phenomenal, from the drinks to the salad to the entrees. I opted for the scallops which is a starter for my entree, but a side of Brussels sprouts and arugula salad I ordered was plenty of food! My husband ordered the sirloin and even though he eats at the top steak restaurants in Chicago he was thoroughly impressed. Now back to Chris, since we expressed we were so satisfied with our food and couldn't eat anymore especially dessert at that moment,he brought out a single candle on a plate for my husband to make a wish on his birthday! It was perfect ending to a wonderful meal. He also recommended we see his friend Julia at a wine bar down street when we asked where we can go next,where again we were treated wonderful!See other review)And lastly,as animal lovers we loved how the resident cat Moma came out as soon as we finished our meal as to give us a farewell, if you are a cat lover def sit outside as she casually walks around and says hi to local patrons, nice touch!!",

We had EXCELLENT and ATTENTIVE service from Alex.  Everything we ordered from cocktails to our culinary journey to our espresso was DELISH.    We started with cocktails (and ended up doing another round) Fig Infused Bourbon (my friend ordered Manhattan sytle) and I did a Chopin in Nocturne (or something like that) which is a Vodka based drink -- both were fantastic (hence ordering another round).  We decided we wanted to taste a little of everything so we ordered 2 salads and 3 appetizers to split.  We had:  Ceasar Salad (standard, nothing really special here although sparse on dressing, some leaves were completely dry) and the Warm Seafood Salad which was absolutely delicious.  We also had:  Mongolian Barbeque Shrimp, Blue and Yellow Corn Beignets and the Korean Style Baby Back Ribs -- ALL were off the charts good.  Between the location and atmosphere, the excellent service and the outstanding food... we WILL be back!",

Nice wine list, impressive entrees (probably the best scallops I've had in a non-coastal city) and truly great desserts. After our second visit (with my wife's parents) was just as good as the first, I feel comfortable giving 5 stars. The outdoor seating is lovely, although you may have to cover your beverages if the trees are blooming... flower petals may sprinkle onto your table. Might be romantic, or annoying, depending on your frame of mind.",

The salmon had just the perfect smokey flavor and not too salty.  White wine spritzer over ice paired well, it even lowered the temperature around me by 10 degrees!  I had the Harissa Spiced PEI Mussels with Charred Yellow Tomato, Chorizo and Creamy Sweet Cilantro Vinaigrette.  That was surprisingly by far the best bowl of mussels I've ever had.  It came with three thick pieces of toasted bread to sop up the creamy, spicy sauce...heaven isn't too far away.    Hubby loved the perfectly executed Red Chili Braised Short Rib with Creamed Sweet Corn, Garlic Haricot Verts and Smoked Anaheim Chili Potatoes he paired with a cabernet.   Ugh.  No room in our tummies for coffee and dessert this time!   We get so giddy with excitement everytime we find a local gem.  There is bad news.  They're closed for the whole month of July.  The anticipation of trying the rest of their magnificently prepared cuisine is killing us!    Until we meet again...",

It's been on my \"to-go\" list for awhile, so I was looking forward to the experience.  Since it was early in the evening we opted for happy hour at the bar.  The atmosphere is very inviting and casual, but nice.  I really liked the way it felt to sit outside and enjoy the evening... though I am sure in the middle of the summer it wouldn't be quite as nice.  For drinks we each had a couple beers and they were served nice and cold (lol).  As far as food is concerned, we shared a few appetizers.  The brushetta was just ok... I've had better and it wasn't traditional, so maybe that's why we didn't love it.  The Harissa mussels were the highlight.  That sauce is awesome and the mussels were cooked perfectly.  The duck 3 ways was also good, but not amazing.  Overall, we had a pleasant experience and the service was great.  The bartender that serviced us was friendly/helpful and directed us to some good selections.  We will be back to try dinner or lunch soon!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I spontaneously decided to check this place out this past weekend and geez, I am SO glad that we did.  I was totally blown away by House of Tricks!  I didn't take any pictures because this place is pretty intimate.  And although the dress code says casual, I personally thought that it was more on the dressy side BUT definitely not formal.   Parking: street parking.  The service: Terrific.  At 7:00PM, I made a reservation for two for 7:15PM via Yelp.  The place was CROWDED, but we showed up around 7:14PM and the waitresses were already waiting to seat us.  Now that's efficient seating! As for the service itself, Axell was very friendly and took the time to go over the menu and made a lot of recommendations tailored to my interests, which I really appreciated.  He also made sure our wine glasses were always full.  The interior: Cute and (really) cozy.  My boyfriend and I got lucky because we were seated immediately.  Unfortunately, the interior of House of Tricks is quite small (after all, it did use to be an actual house -- most of the seating is outdoors). This meant that we could hear every conversation going on at each of the tables.  We came to House of Tricks to celebrate my birthday and some other huge life milestones.  I didn't mind this so much, but I think the two of us would've appreciated a more intimate setting.  However, we did stay at the restaurant pretty late and as it began to clear out, it certainly felt like we got the best seats in the house!  If we ever go back, I definitely want to check out the outdoor seating.  From what I saw, there was a lot of outdoor space heaters and lights.  Definitely much more intimate.  The food: 10/10.  I'm not 100% sure, but I think their menu is seasonal... For our appetizer, we ordered some scallop dish (but not the seared scallop BLT).  I'm not a huge fan of seafood, but those freaking scallops were so tasty! They were HUGE, they were light, and they were packed with an explosion of different flavors.  As for our entrees, I ordered the salmon (but not the same one as the one listed on the online menu) and my boyfriend ordered the veal osso bucco.  Neither of us got the chance to try the other one's dish because we were both too busy devouring our own dishes.  We. Ate. Everything.  The salmon was the perfect portion and had the perfect balance between sweet and savory.  I don't know which exact cab my boyfriend ordered, but we thoroughly enjoyed it as indicated by the empty wine bottle.  It seemed to pair perfectly with the salmon. Everything was perfect.  So if you're looking for a new place to take your loved one(s), I'd definitely recommend House of Tricks!  This is a great place for a romantic date or for a small, private gathering.  This just might be my new goto restaurant for special occasions.",

The day after the reservation was booked I called around 10am to Inquire about gluten free and vegetarian options and shared that we were treating our out of town guests to dinner to celebrate their union that took place 6 months prior.  When the four of us stepped up to be seated the hostess never asked for a name just looked at her seating chart and sat us.  I personally did not feel warmly welcomed. And there were no other tables.   So you suggest I shouldn't taken care of it then instead of via social media.   Maybe the hostess should've acknowledge the reservation when we walked up and warmly suggest a drink at the bar until a more inviting table became available but instead treated us like walk ins and sat us in the far dark corner.  And yes we were having a good time at the table visiting our friends but had little to do with House of Tricks.",

Parking can be pretty difficult cause it's all street parking but the good thing is after 6pm it's free street parking. Woo hoo.   As we walk in, you basically walk into a garden with many outdoor tables. They do have some indoor but they were all full inside. So outdoors it is. Outside has lots of bushes and trees to make the dining experience a little more private with water misters keeping you cool. It was really nice and comfortable once the sunset.   We were greeted at our table right away and they brought us water and bread. The bread was really soft and chewy. Very fresh.   Me and my wife started out by splitting a baby kale & romaine salad. It was really really good. Really loved it.  It came with fresh black berries, walnuts, candied bacon, and apple slices over a creamy salad dressing. Really fresh. All the ingredients really came together. Outstanding salad.   I had the sumac crusted lamb rack with sweet potatoes and figs. The sweet potatoes and figs were cooked perfectly. Really good and moist. Melt in your mouth. Only problem was the lamb rack. It was good but not great. Didn't really stand out to me. They give you four bones and a fairly good portion. So it was okay.   My wife got the brick roasted Cornish game hen and this was really good. Juicy tender. Fresh. I got to sample and it was very good. Both my kids got the beef tenderloin and they loved it. I got a bite and this was so tender. Melt in your mouth good. They were both raving about it. My mom got the smoked Korean style baby back ribs but it was a little spicy for her cause it has spicy red chile paste. I tried it and it was fall off the bone goodness but pretty spicy. Not that spicy but gave a decent kick. It was very good.   So our server was really good. He greeted us and took care of us. Checking on us. Our water cups were filled on a regular basis. So service was really good. The food was quite good. Very fresh. All the dishes were really good but just wasn't impressed with the lamb rack (- 1 star). Loved the ambiance and everything about the House of Tricks. I would definitely come back again. Enjoy.",

    "text": "I don't often give out five stars, but this time, it is well deserved.  It was a quiet birthday dinner for a long-time friend and we had reservations for early afternoon.  It was a warm day, but the extensive outdoor area is misted and well-shaded.  We were guests, however, and our hosts preferred inside dining.  The House of Tricks is an old home that has been remodeled into a quaint restaurant with exceptional food.  We started with a drink from the bar called \"Weeds\".  A hemp-infused Vodka with some other stuff, garnished with Bee Pollen.  This drink was quite refreshing, not too sweet and not too alcohol-Ly tasting.  A perfect starter on a warm day.  Passing on the appetizers, we started with a crisp, light dressed Caesar salad that was cool and refreshing.  The salad maybe could have used a bit more dressing, and one of our companions did ask for more, which was quickly delivered.  Following our salads, I had the Orange-Blackberry seared Duck Breast.  My wife enjoyed her Blackened Ahi Tuna.  Both dishes were cooked perfectly and the presentation was beautiful.    The duck was tender and juicy, with a nice crusty sear, cooked a perfect medium.  The garnish only enhanced the flavor of this delicious dish and my plate was quickly cleaned of all evidence.  The wife hardly spoke during dinner, mostly because she couldn't stop eating - clearly she enjoyed the beautifully presented Ahi dish.  After dinner, the dessert people among us opted for the Salted Caramel Apple Bread pudding.  Once again, a beautiful presentation, a tall column of bread pudding, topped with a flavored whipped cream and drizzled with fresh butter and salted caramel sauce.  Service was impeccable, as was expected and we were not disappointed.  The dining room is a bit loud, and for a hearing-impaired person, this is a bit much to take on, so I would recommend the outside dining.  The bathrooms open right on to the dining room and there is a table right there, so that could be a bit disconcerting, but when I used it, I just avoided eye contact with other diners :-)  There is metered parking on the street out front, but we opted to park in the rear, where we found a nice, shaded spot.  This is a small parking lot in the back, so good luck.  Prices are on the high side, but for the experience and the food, I say well worth the expense.  I'll be back.",

We did not try dessert! Next time.   If you go, make reservations. We were seated promptly and they read that it was our anniversary and greeted us as such.  Thank you HOT!",

(It used to be fairly regularly for us with friends, but we changed our Gammage seats to Sunday a while back and they're closed on Sunday) I wish that I could say we had a good experience like we always used to but it was pretty awful unfortunately.    We eat out at least every other week at busy restaurants, we understand slow service happens, especially on busy nights, (and we arrived 2 hours and 20 minutes ahead of the show to allow for that).  What we didnt understand is a server (I won't mention his name) who from the beginning seemed disconnected, uninterested, and seemed to act as though he didnt want to be there.  Even when things fell apart, he made very little attempt at making things right.  We have always had *exceptional* service every time prior at House of Tricks, so this was just so unexpected.    Our food arrived quite a while after the tables' next to us, even though we arrived before them.  (They ordered almost exactly what we did, so it wasn't the type of food that was the delay) Our table was rarely checked on, (except by the bus-boy with water) and no attempt at an apology was given until I complained about the long delay.  Our server finally checked on us after the food arrived, and ask how everything tasted.  We didnt know, as the bus-boy had taken our silverware and didnt return with any until several minutes after the food arrived.  Overall the food was very good, (Ahi Tuna, Salmon, Portobello Etouffee, and the SeaBass), as good as we remembered.  The service unfortunately was pretty awful, and the $15 credit and free (single) dessert on a tab of over $210 was a sad attempt at trying to make things right.  No sight of the manager either which to me says the service issues extend far beyond the server in question.  House of Tricks was a favorite of ours for many years, it had been a toss-up for us between this and Monarch Cafe for a delicious meal in a beautiful, romantic setting.  After last nights experience I feel as though we have no reason to return.  Such a shame.",

So, I cancelled and won't plan to go again. I don't mind so much that they won't honor a request, what I minded was the attitude that came with it. A very poor way to make guests feel welcome. Don't you realize that the person who answers your phone is, many times, the first impression of your restaurant? You need to offer him some training as to how to speak with your guests in a way that expresses your policy but doesn't make you not want to dine in your restaurant. No thank you. We'll take our business  and our money to restaurants that are warm, kind, welcoming and act like they appreciate our business. I wonder if the owners know this person is turning customers off on the phone? Perhaps they need to hire a mystery shopper to hear what your customers are hearing.",

Located right near the ASU Tempe campus, we have enjoyed many celebratory dinners here while our kids were in college.  The outdoor garden setting is absolutely gorgeous and whether you are just enjoying wine and appetizers or an entire dinner it is a great choice. What I love about House of Tricks is the unique (never boring) appetizers, soups, salads and entrees with a southwestern influences.  The menu changes and offers seasonal choices.  The wine list is great and offers many wines by the glass.  I am not a huge dessert person, but the bread pudding at house of tricks is so good, you won't regret it.   They do close during the summer months, so be sure you call before going.",

I ordered the sea bass which was sweet and mild in flavor but overwhelmed by the black beans accompanying it. The artisan cheese plate and smoked salmon as starters were the highlight of the meal. Phenomenal cheese choices and delicately-flavored salmon. The prices were steep, around $250 for five of us, but if you're looking for high-quality food and a relaxed environment this is your spot.",

They did deduct that from the bill on their own accord.  The scallop appetizer didn't have a proper sear and was a tad over cooked.  The asparagus salad was average - very little flavor. My pork shank was too sweet and again slightly over cooked.  They accidentally dumped my daughter's beef entree on her lap for which they apologized but made no real other amends except preparing a new one. Ironically enough, that was the best item we ate. The creme brulee was burnt leaving a terrible aftertaste and the inside and had the consistency of cooked eggs. Overall, overrated and nowhere near worth the prices. We won't be back.",

It's pretty classy and is a great place for a nice date or classy occasion. Not very vegetarian friendly and is a little pricy, but the dining experience is well worth the price. Totally cute.",

After 30 minutes we were getting agitated and went and asked she very rudely answered that the wait will be 30 more minutes. She is not even apologizing and even didn't say sorry and asked us to go to another lunch place. What a crazy rude place this has become. Completely lost respect. Guys if you are in a restaurnt business please at least first learn to respect customers and say sorry!! Such a mean staff!!",

    "text": "I know that this place gets rave reviews from ASU faculty, so I took some out-of-town guests for lunch.  I had made reservations online and specifically requested indoor seating.  When we arrived, our table had been prepared outdoors--and, even worse, out in the open, so it was covered in fallout from the trees and speckled with bird poo.  We requested in indoor table and were quickly accommodated.  I'm guessing that some people find bird poo to be 'quaint' or authentic, but I don't.  To summarize: Some of the food is delicious, while some of the food is disappointing.  Club sandwich was delicious, grilled chicken sandwich was dry and flavorless.  The menu reads much more impressively than the food that arrives.  I was also disappointing that it took over an hour to receive our lunch entrees on a Monday afternoon.  One of our five dishes had also been incorrectly prepared (ordered without hot peppers, but they were included), but we didn't have time to get the food corrected, since we had an engagement.  Service seems adequate, at best, but the servers seem fairly apathetic.  Not rude or incompetent, just not attentive.",

I was impressed upon entry as the place looks classy.  My date wanted a glass of wine but the waiter thought she was under 21.  She forgot to bring her ID so no wine for her.  Bummer.  She looks way older than 21.  I had ordered a the french dip roast beef sandwich.  It came out so-so.  Way overcooked roast beef and it was very dry.  I had much better roast beef sandwiches for $8 at nice sandwich shops.  The waiter was really nice and offered to take it back which I did.  I then ordered the ruby red trout.  When it came out, it looked like cooked salmon.  I was expecting trout but as the waiter explained it was ruby red trout.  It tasted exactly like salmon and bad salmon at that.  My date took a bite too and agreed it was bad fish.  I told the waiter and he took it back.  I finally go the mashed potatoes which were heavenly.    My date really liked her salad.  She thought it was great.  The place had a lot of orange fruit trees and outside seating during nice weather is good.  Overall I am disappointed in the food quality here as I was expecting some good food based on all the reviews.  Service was good.  Ambiance was great.",

I started my meal off with a cup of exotic Asian beef soup.  The flavors included corn and cilantro.  The soup was incredible, possible one of the best soups I have ever had.  The broth was clear and light.  Temperature and spice was precise.  Clearly hit the spot.  I then had a lovely ahi tuna salad.  Portion was huge, tuna perfect and lightly dressed.  The pasta and veggies underneath were tasty and refreshing, perfect for a hot summer day.  The problems here are a few.  Acoustics are really bad.  The floor is wood as are all the furnishings.  It was very noisy and hard to hear others at my table.  The outside is a tad rundown.  Looks like they need some paint and repairs.  Does not have the best curb appeal for a high end establishment.  Service was wonderful.  I will definitely be coming back.",

The location seems to be in a former residence with a casual garden surrounding diners eating al fresco. There is air conditioned dining available.The food is well prepared and reasonably priced. It is the favored location for entertaining visiting faculty and VIP's from ASU. It is a very popular spot for graduation celebrations so make your reservations well in advance. Parking behind the restaurant will spare you the unpleasant surprise of a parking ticket for those who linger beyond the parking meters 1 hour limit. The serving portions are generous. The deserts are equally delicious! Been visiting about 10 times a year for the past 12 years and always a great meal at the House of Tricks.",

    "text": "I went here last night with a friend of mine after a long break of simply forgetting how close House of Tricks was located to me. The ambiance and table setup strike a nice mix of casual and refinement. you're going to be comfortable there whoever you are. The server Jessica was a pleasure and seemed to guess right that I was on a date, so she acted accordingly which was a nice touch...you know, adding a little more formality and checking in frequently with suggestions to the wine and drink list. She suggested the green thing and freaky squirrel for cocktails and they were both very good. We had the pork belly appetizer which was very tender and complimented the large bread basket well. We skipped getting a salad which was good idea because the entrees were surprisingly large cuts of meat. I had the Grilled Beef Tenderloin which was exceptional. I suggest when the server asks you how you want it cooked, to just let the chef decide at a place like this. It was perfect. The other entree was the double pork chops still on the bone and it was beyond tender and flavorful. Easily the best pork chop I've tasted and my date couldn't finish it all if that gives you an idea on the portion. Both were served with mashed potatoes and asparagus. The asparagus was cooked properly but the mashed potatoes could probably have used some cream in them, not bad but i'm picky on simple sides like that. The biggest thumbs up I can give is that the steak arrived hot. If you get steaks/cuts of meat at restaurants, you know this to be one of the most anticipated moments and i'm usually very disappointed, but not this time. The food was promptly brought and it makes a difference. The biggest let down of the meal was the dessert, We ordered the doughnuts and they were more like flavorless hush puppies. A bit too dense and overcooked, these doughnuts just didn't do it for me but my date seemed to enjoy them. The desserts at other people's tables looked really good and the remorse of not getting the peanut butter infused treat also probably played a part in my not loving the doughnuts. The price is pretty much on par with any upscale steak place, while some people might not understand that given the location is an older house setting, you have to embrace that you're paying for the peace of mind that you're not in a cheesy setting and you're still getting 4-5 star service and food. That's a big deal if you're a foodie or appreciate what matters in my opinion. That being said, If you're showing up for dinner and you plan on having a few drinks, you should probably be prepared to spend around $130 or so. Pretty reasonable considering your only other option in the area is cafe boa for something similar. Again, props to the server, Jessica- she was really helpful and fun. I considered a 5 star review, but decided to hold off until another visit to confirm how much i enjoyed dinner.",

When I brought it to our waiter's attention, he said it was half a chicken and had to have the dark meat.  Wish he had told me that in the beginning.  I only ate the white meat part.  The risotto was not cooked properly, was borderline mushy.  We were so disappointed, we did not even have dessert there and we always have dessert!  After an unsatisfying meal, we had to wait for a really long time for our waiter to bring the check and even longer to get it back after we pointed out an error on the check.

Looks like some of those other restaurants aren't in business anymore or don't open for dinner.  You see an occassional couple strolling through. Parking - Metered street parking till 6 pm, so bring coins!  Busy so come early to find parking. Reservations - Sometimes required and always recommended.  Very busy place. Service- Superb.  Price - Great for the experience. Ambiance - Cottage feel.  Request outside seating in the garden area.  Candles and string lights provide soft glow along with heat lamps.  Very romantic. Menu - Changes often.  Therefore, some of the items I wanted to try from my Yelp research was not on the menu.    Food - 1. Mixed Baby Lettuce Salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette and Goat Cheese Croutons - Didn't try.  My friend seemed to like it. 2. Green Chile Salmon & Shrimp Cakes with Citrus Jicama Slaw and Smoked Yellow Pepper Remoulade - Not fishy at all.  Great flavor with a bit of a kick from the green chile.  Lots of salmon and shrimp, little breading.  Loved the jicama slaw.  Really refreshing contrast to the remoulade. 3. 13 oz NY Strip with an Heirloom Tomato Salad of Shaft Blue Cheese, Garlic Chips, Arugula, Radish Sprouts and Anna Potatoes - Meat was real tender and flavorful.  Salad was a bit oversalted.  Potatoes were sliced thin, layered and baked.  A bit dry and salty though.  Overall a good dish. 4. Pumpkin Seed Crusted Filet Mignon with Potato Masa Cake, Guajillo Chile Glaze, Haricot Verts And Roasted Poblano Aioli -  A bit disappointing.  Meat was incredibly tender.  You could probably cut it with the fork.  However, the meat wasn't seared/seasoned properly.  Although cooked medium rare as requested, it had that grayish hue color instead of a dark burnt color on the outside and medium cool inside.  Pumpkin seeds provided little flavor and the meat need more flavor/salt.  Potato cakes were good, similar to a breaded and pan fried mash potato. Chili glaze provided a small kick and flavor.  Haricot verts (green beans) were really over salted. 5. Everything Spiced Ahi Tuna on Toasted Couscous with Avocado Tangerine Fennel Slaw In Ginger Chile Vinaigrette and White Miso Sabayon - AMAZING.  Three of us went and the two that didn't order this dish, wished we had.  We were skeptical to order fish, especially raw fish in a land locked state.  By far, the best ahi tuna any of us have ever had.  Thick cuts of tuna that you can cut with a fork.  No bits of tendons or chewy bites.  The tuna had coarse ground seasoning on it of salt, pepper and something else.  Reminded me of a Montreal seasoning for steak.  No five spices or heavy aromatic seasoning on it.  Definitely definitely try this. 6. Volver Tempranillo- Good top note, nice finish. 7. Cranberry Apple Bake - Cranberries were very tart.  Decent but the clumps of cranberry made my mouth pucker. 8. Cranberry Bread Pudding -  Very good.  Huge bits of bread baked with sweet cranberry, topped with ice cream.  Highly recommended.  Although some of the veggies were overly salty, I would love to come back.  The ambiance, service and fushion of ingredients were great.  I'd give this place 4.5 stars, but since I can't, I'll round up to 5 stars for flavor, presentation and uniqueness factor.",

    "text": "With so many amazing restaurants in the area (that charge the same high prices), I can't understand why this place gets good reviews. I can only assume people don't know any better and are so charmed by the historic bungalows that they can't see they are getting ripped off. I have been here twice with family, and the first time I thought the food was mediocre, and the second time confirmed it. The ceasar salad tasted like something you would get at Denny's, and the salmon came with what I can only describe as \"airport quality\" potato cubes that tasted like leftover morning hash browns. At least there were only a tiny amount of potatoes, next to a tiny amount of brussel sprouts - and all that for the same price of an amazing entree at a real 4 star restaurant. Please save your money and go someplace great. The service and drinks were fine, but the food is really sub par for the price.",

I went there earlier this week to have dinner with a friend. House of Tricks has a great ambiance. It's definitely a \"date-night\" sort of place.   We sat outside on the patio. I ordered a Manhatten Iced Tea, which ended up not being my cup of tea (no pun intended), but it was a well made drink. For an appetizer, we ordered the Artisan Cheese & Fruit plate. Delicious! Fruit and cheese plates always make me feel fancy. The presentation was great..it was like a work of art. For the main entree, I had the Sugar-Spiced Salmon with Chinese Long Beans, Mustard Sauce, Sweet Soy-Ponzu, Sticky Rice and Nori. The salmon was probably the best salmon I've ever had. It was perfectly seasoned and cooked impeccably. The rest of the dish was just as good..oh that sauce! It was sweet with just the right amount of spice.  One drawback I have noticed-Thankfully I am now a pescitarian because the vegetarian options are quite limited. I'd suggest checking out the website before going. :)  From the looks of the other reviews, I see that the menu is seasonal, so I look forward to coming back and trying what else this place has to offer.",

Satan finally decided to stop savaging The Valley of the Sun in the ass since it's now fall, and it was only 80 F outside at night - so I sat outside with my wife under the trees. Nice romantic setting. The tables were spaced out nicely so we didn't have to smell any other people or hear the stupid things they were saying, which was good. Got the salmon and it was delicious. Service was really good but I am 99% sure our waiter was on coke. He was sweating profusely and kept fumbling with both his words and physical items. Not that we cared, it added to the fun. Odell IPA on tap and only $4.50! We decided to get creme brulee for dessert, and finished the experience off right with a 16 year Lagavulin, served in the correct snifter glass. $120 with tax and tip for two people. Pretty much every entree was about $30, which I felt was about $10 overpriced - it was great but not $30 outstanding.",

To top it off service was extremely slow and they acted very snobby towards us even though we were part of a fairly large party.

We had a wonderful time, the atmosphere is lovely, and we treated ourselves to a full experience; the spinach dip appetizer was incredibly creamy and yummy; we split a red-wine marinated tenderloin salad which had some absolutely scrumptious chunks of quality rare beef; my daughter had the homemade pork pastrami sandwich, which was delicious - except, they forgot to add the Irish porterhouse cheddar cheese, which we didn't notice until after we left - my daughter took the majority of her sandwich to go. So sad, that cheese would have been marvelous on that sandwich! My lunch special, the shrimp fried rice with two types of shrimp, had lots of flavor. For dessert, we splurged on the salted caramel apple bread pudding, along with the special, a peanut butter/peach tort. Oh, my. Excellent service, excellent food, would have been five stars if the cheese was on the sandwich. Our bad for not noticing until later, but still...We will be back.",

Tucked away from the chaos of Tempe's student population but close enough to walk to neighboring bars and entertainment venues. House of Tricks is a must for anyone seeking an upscale experience, that's worth the price in Tempe Arizona. Very professional and knowledgeable staff, and an extensive menu and wine list, it is obvious the owners poured their hearts and souls into this place. Have never personally sat inside, even though it looks great, but you will know why once you experience the patio. A historic piece of Tempe, you must try House of Tricks if your in the area.",

Our server knew we were celebrating a birthday and treated my husband like a guest of honor all night. She also successfully managed a table where only half of us ordered off the special tasting menu and the others ordered separate courses. It feels like the chef has found 6th gear or something. The food has always been solid...but now it's gotten really inventive and fun...and exceptionally executed. At the end, I ordered an after dinner drink that I thought would be something different than I got. The manager replaced it right away with something else and was really really polite about the whole thing, even though it was me that made an uneducated choice.   Full disclosure - I go here a lot. My office shares a rear parking lot with the place and it's just a really easy lunch or happy hour spot. I always get greeted warmly and taken care of generously. I love their staff. I love their vibe. And now I can say with authority that their \"fancy group dinner\" game is just as great.",

We all ordered salad to start: House of Tricks Caesar Salad, Mixed Spring Greens, and Grilled Eggplant and Fresh Tomato Salad. The entrees were the Blackened Ahi Tuna and the Seared Scallop BLT. Though, the Scallop dish was an appetizer (2 scallops), I was asked by our server if I wanted to add an extra to make it a dinner, and I said \"yes\".  All the food was delicious, cooked to order. Keep in mind House of Tricks menu is a little eclectic, combining different ingredients and spices that come together. My only comment: I was a little thrown off on was we got the bill I noted to add an extra one Scallop on my already $19 dollar appetizer, I was charged $9. $28 dollars for 3 Scallops. My bad for not asking what the up-charge was. So keep that in mind.. it was still delicious!  Atmosphere: Beautiful Garden Patio Dining, Service: excellent, Food: very good.",

They area is filled with blooming trees and flowers.  The issue is the service. Takes a very long time for drinks to come out and to be checked on. The drinks weren't even consistent. I ordered one drink that was good. I ordered it again, and it was completely different and awful. The food is only okay and not memorable. What is memorable is how the server refused to give us extra plates and silverware because she didn't want us to have a birthday cake someone brought. She claimed it was the law where birthday cakes cannot be served in the restaurant, but I've been to several restaurants where that is not the case. She claimed that we can't have birthday cake because if we get sick, then the restaurant will be to blame. We discovered she is mistaken, and that if you bring birthday cake and get sick, then you acknowledge you cannot blame the restaurant.  I should have asked for the manager, but we were the third to last table there since it took almost two hours to be served. Everyone in out party was just sad and wanted to leave as quickly as possible. I was embarrassed. Thank you for the memorable birthday party. I'll have to be dragged here to come here again.",

The environment was classy and respectful. The host was very respectful and sat us in a beautiful section outside. The waiter was very precise and his timing was impeccable. I ordered a bottle of wine, but sadly they were all out, but he recommended a wine that was truly even better than the one I've requested. I then ordered the bison meatloaf and Duck, and let me tell you... i was AMAZED. Such incredible taste and combinations of flavor. I loved it and so did my girlfriend. Once dinner was complete, we moved onto the Salted Caramel Apple dessert. Which I recommend 100%.  In summary, this restaurant is just so damn amazing. Affordable as well, which is a plus.  I loved it and my experience was amazing, Can't wait to return!",

Such a unique garden setting just off Tempe's Mill Ave. Over the last couple of years, things seemed to have gone downhill - ho-hum food and mediocre service. They had really lost their edge.  Returned for lunch today and tried a new menu item (Green Curry Crispy Tofu Bowl). It was delicious!!! And we were served by an attentive waiter who was not only knowledgeable about the menu, but enthusiastic! And willing to go and get more information for us. I was happy to see the change, and I will be back!  Update: Back again today and the Green Curry Crispy Tofu Bowl was again delicious. Unfortunately the service was very slow again. We are working folk and cannot sit around for nearly an hour before getting the entrees. I realize the 1920s authenticity is part of the charm, but the wood benches are pretty painful when you're waiting on food to come.",

As long-time Tempe residents, House of Tricks is among our favorite hidden spots in Tempe, because it really doesn't feel like Tempe and instead feels like a little French getaway tucked inside of - gasp! - greenery!    The food and drinks are excellent, and while service is typically not REMARKABLE, the atmosphere makes up for it ten fold. I'm always super pleased with my experiences here - at the bar and on the patio.  Speaking of patio, about 3/4 of the seating is outdoors on the front patio. If it's the right time of year, i.e. spring, fall, or winter, I highly recommend you choose the outdoor option. Inside feels a little \"older\" so House of Tricks is not my go-to during the summer. I much prefer the patio atmosphere!",

We arrived and had the best weather - right before temperatures are going to spike to triple digits. They provided a lovely table outside that was shaded and under the front porch. We began with the cheese and charcuterie platter and the mussels which were to die for. They have a nice cocktail list and wine. A few from our group had the bison meatloaf which was hearty and very tasty. I enjoyed the salmon dish which was sweet and savory and over a bed of rice with a drizzle of lemon curd. Dessert was particularly interesting with my favorite being the purple sweet potato gelato (sounds strange but has an interesting flavor similar to cake batter). Service was a bit slow in between courses but the server was very engaging and knowledgeable about the menu. Delicious!",

    "text": "So, it really SUCKS writing this review. I have been coming to this place since I first began medical school in the area about 4 years ago. I even had my medschool graduation brunch here in July.   I guess I'm just really incredibly put off by the event that happened last night while having dinner up at the bar with my colleague.   First off, we were there to discuss work and just wanted a nice meal and good cocktail. The female bartender started out helping us which was fine, whe acted very rushed which was a bit annoying but I just figured the season is picking up so didn't think much of it. About 20 minutes into our experience, I asked the male bartender for some extra blue cheese olives. He looked at me and said: \"That's going to cost ya\", I just stared at him and said, that's fine. He went on to say (based on my facial expression, I presume), that their blue cheese is such good quality that they have to charge and just kept blubbering on about it when I had already said OK. Then he said, \"Geez, I'm just kidding!\". So I chuckled strangely because it was all just so childish, tacky, and not classy, especially since I wasn't there to be entertained by him.  So he said, no you still have to pay $1.00 but then the next ones will be free. I was so fed up with his yammering on that I just said: \"Ya know, I find it tacky that you guys are doing this and making a prodcution about the extra cost, just add to the price up front. Who DOESN'T want blue cheese olves with their dirty martini?!  So the bartender did not like my comment, he began trying degrade me and tell me I don't know what I'm talking about and it's totally fine and acted like he was enlightening me all the while defensively scolding me.  I was so fed up, I picked up my phone and looked down and said, \"I\"m done talking about this. Charge me and move on\".  He was so arrogant and just really set the tone for the reamining portion of the night. About 30 mintues later, he came up behind me and said \"Do we need to talk about this? Are you talking about me?\" He was literally in my face like a ghetto, masaginst asshole. I honestly can't believe he's there. He was looking to pick a fight and is more than likely just a restaurant worker for life who's develeoped quite the chip on his shoulder.   Directly after we finished the dinner (which was delicious), the hurried female bartender went to hand us the dessert menu and spilled a full glass of ice water all over my collequge and dog that was under her chair. The glass shattered and she just said, Oh I'm so sorry. No free dessert, no espresso on the house, nothing.   If this season is so busy and the bartenders have too much going on, they need to hire more staff.   Anyway, it's disheartening that the bartender was so argumentative with a customer. I wasn't there for all that drama. I hope he gets fired so we can go back without worrying about his tacky humor and abrasive quarreling.",

To start off, this place is expensive. Wouldn't really be able to afford it if our parents weren't paying. I think for the 5 of us our bill came out to over $400. However, the food was AMAZING. We sat inside because it was a bit chilly, but they have a beautiful patio with a fire put. I wished we hat sat out there but I was trumped by the family. I had the lamb shank with risotto. The lamb shank was braised to perfection and the risotto was slightly sweet and paired with the lamb perfectly. I know nothing about wine except that I like to drink it. Whatever bottle we had was lovely and seemed to pair perfectly with everyone's meals. I would definitely come back here.",

Our food was warm but not as hot as it should of been; they comped our dessert after we declined to reorder. But the food and dessert were excellent, otherwise.

My sirloin was cooked just right and the combination of the garlic mashed and sauteed spinach were to die for.  Customer service was excellent and I loved that our glasses were always full.   One thing I especially appreciated was that they took a late reservation for 6 people at 9:30 pm even though they closed at 10 pm. At no time did we feel rushed or in a hurry to get out of there; there was no feeling of pressure at all. They seemed to go on about their business without tarnishing our dining experience.

I absolutely love the menu choices and the chef does a great job of straying away from the ordinary. I like that the menu changes seasonally and there is always something new to try as well. The most recent standouts would have to be the Korean BBQ ribs, mussels in a spicy chorizo sauce, grits, and ahi. Also a great place for a juicy steak. The service is timely, professional, and attentive. I will continue to be a guest and recommend House of Tricks for long to come!",

It's the kind of spot that feels impressive and upscale - if that's your cup of tea, have at it. For me, the name was more exciting than the experience. Lunch options are very limited to the soup, salad, sandwich variety. Again, not bad if you like that sort of thing.  We were seated about 5min after arriving (outside). The patio was cute, but the trees made for a bit of a challenge - flies and nature and whatnot. I had the Caesar Salad with Salmon - good.   Depending on my mood and the company, I'd come again.",

The moment you walk in, you are taking out of the busy Mill Avenue crowd and enter into a romantic oasis with candlelight, small fountains, and cozy patio atmosphere. My hubby and I came here on Friday night for happy hour. The bar was completely packed so we settled on a table near the fireplace. We ordered a few appetizers: Foie Gras - it was good, but it prepared better elsewhere Harrisa Spiced Mussels - WOW WOW WOW. The mussels and broth where cooked to perfection. I was happy they gave us extra bread to dip in the delicious sauce.  House made Squid Ink pasta - The pasta still needed to be cooked more for my linking but I was happy that they had this dish since I love squid ink anything :) Soft shell crab - Unfortunately, this dish fell completely flat. I was hoping for this crab to be tempura and crispy. Both of us where not a fan at all.  We will come back one more time to try out their dinner entrees. Hopefully, they will bring their A game the second time in order for us to put it in our happy hour roster.",

There have been days where they were completely booked but still found me a table.   The food is definitely a grade above the ambiance, which is stellar, to which a foodie can only appreciate. The last two visits I had the entree special. In may, I had slow cooked braised short ribs with a corn and garlic & jalapeno grits compote. The meat fell off the bone effortlessly and melted in my mouth. Outstanding flavor and portion size.   Last night I had the hanger steak special with shiitake mushrooms and roasted red potatoes. Cooked to my preference perfectly and left feeling that I wish there was more.   Service is always good and everyone is polite and presentable which adds to the charm of this ASU local establishment. Atmosphere is causal but in a way that complements any occasion.   I will be back and recommend to anyone who wants a great meal with a diverse atmosphere.",

We sat outdoors and we could not have asked for a more perfect night to have a romantic, delicious dinner.  My husband had the Beef Tenderloin and I had the Lamb Shank.  My husband devoured the tenderloin, while the lamb shank was a lot of food and I could only eat half.  Oh, we also started off with some cheese, fruit, toasted baguettes, candied nuts and some honey mustard sauce.    Everything was very yummy.  Kate was our server and she was perfect.    Though we were both very tired from a long day filled with lots of activities with the kids, we were glad to have this time alone and to spend it here.  We also got a parking spot right in the front.  I'll post some pics of the food at a later time.    Definitely a nice place for couples to come to.",

The server had a full beard and watching him bring the tray of food - his beard was in it. Disgusting. He put the plates on the table in a haphazard fashion - not a good job at all, and the food was very slow to come.  The quiche didn't have much flavor other than bacon, which should have been an accent, not the only flavor I tasted and what should have been the flavor, wasn't.  It lacked flavor overall.  It was a little dry, a little overcooked but it was edible, not bad, just not great, and they under sized it so an additional piece was added to the plate, not really how a dish should have been served. The gingerbread was so dry and hard, after a couple of bites, that was it - for $10 - it was inedible, not what a gingerbread should be.  Disappointed.",

This place always offers fresh options daily, and I never find myself looking at the same menu whenever I come here, which is great! I'm impressed every time I order. I've taken friends and family to this restaurant, and they feel the same about the food here, so that's a plus. The food here is a fusion of many different cultures, and every time, the chefs make it work. I once had a chicken burger with oaxaca cheese and miscellaneous toppings with fried okra, and I've never been able to find a chicken burger that was treated the same way. I also ordered a grilled salmon with a spring salad on top, and despite it being farm-raised salmon, it was still flavourful and complimented the salad very well.   All their food is presented gorgeously, and the service is also some of the best I've experienced.",

I love the ambiance this historic house provides and in a way that makes me forget that I'm in the heart of a college town. House of Tricks slightly reminds me of a restaurant I'd find in Berkley, CA or LA. It's charming, open and has plenty of seating outside.   The food here is basic luncheon food such as tasty sandwiches. My favorite go-to sandwich when I visit is the Tuna. The sandwiches are hefty but it's really about the atmosphere when I visit.   I will always remember the time I was eating lunch with my sister when the red hat ladies (a group here in Phoenix) walked in and overtook the restaurant. They were so cute in their red hats and they really made me realize that the House of Tricks is your quintessential \"ladies who lunch\" restaurant to Tempe.

My favorite out door lunch and dinner spot is not off my list at least until the construction is completed.  However, tried to go to lunch this past Saturday and encountered service staff who may be feeling the pinch or maybe this place is now terrible for service. Snooty, rude staff who were not accommodating in the least, told us we needed a reservation for a table when there might have been 25 empty tables.  Food is also well below the standards that I've enjoyed in the past.   Potato salad dry as a bone, no flavor (maybe old). Sandwich- salmon overcooked, fishy tasting, basically a terrible lunch. I've been coming here for over 20 years, very sorry to see it in such a decline. Perhaps the owners don't care and everyone is dialing in it. My advice go elsewhere!!",

    "text": "4.5 stars  Oh House of Tricks, you are a sneaky devil aren't you?  Did you know I was coming? Is that why you pulled out all the stops for my visit? Did you know you were flirting with someone who doesn't give 5 stars freely? Is this always how you are, or are you only charming when good company is around? Well if you keep it up, you're going to get hit with 5 stars!   I have visited House of Tricks three times. The first time I was on a hot date with a couple and a dog (yeah, that's how I roll). We sat out on the bar patio and decided to order a few dishes to share with each other. We started with a cheese plate that was very good and did not lack variety. For the entree I chose the beef tenderloin rare. The other entree that was picked was the vegetarian lasagna. Now, with me being a well known carnivore I will say that I was nervous about a vegetarian dish. We were served a bread basket with butter. Here's one of my pet peeves: Cold bread with cold butter. Never the twain shall meld. One must be warm! Give me a softened butter on cold bread or warm bread with cold butter. Get it? Moving on.  Our dishes arrived after a short wait. Ah and how beautiful it was! The tenderloin was on a bed of mashed potatoes and greens and tasted wonderful! The meat was perfectly cooked! Now to try the lasagna! Omigosh! What a surprise! The lasagna was so delicious that I almost pushed aside my steak to eat the lasagna...almost. I sat back full and astonished at the great meal I just had!   The second visit I had was lunch with a coworker. I chose the Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak. It came with Asadero cheese stuffed tortillas with roasted Ancho sauce, avocado puree and cilantro rice. Perfection! Absolute perfection! Everything was delicious, flavorful and well executed! I'm not a fan of cilantro and I even enjoyed the rice! The visit was certainly a 5 star visit.   My third visit was for a dear friend's birthday dinner. I was so excited to go! For an appetizer I chose the foie gras and fig appetizer. It was so decadent. The mixture of savory/salty foie gras with a sweet fig mixture was heavenly! For my main dish I went with the tenderloin on top of a greens mixture and mashed potatoes. Everything was great until I started tasting WAY TOO MUCH salt. I am a salt lover and it turned out that the potatoes were oversalted. I called our servers attention to it and and she brought another dish out with just sauteed greens. It was perfect!   I adore House of Tricks. Their menu changes with the seasons and there is always something new I want to try on the menu. If it weren't for a couple VERY SMALL issues, I would give them 5 stars in a heart beat! I look forward to visiting the restaurant again VERY soon!",

I'm new to America so dining in new places is always fun, especially when someone recommends this place 10 times over.   It was so dark I couldn't see my menu. I didn't mind though, the waiter was funny with it, held a couple of candles by the menu till I picked what I wanted.   But what I ordered, when it eventually arrived was really cold. I was soooo hungry after a fairly long wait for just entrees that I couldn't wait another 45mins. What I had was delicious! But just cold after a long wait. We were both hungry after our entrees as well....  I would really love to go back and may be this time round the food would be hot!  It did leave a dent in the wallet though....So may be not for awhile....",

To sum up our evening....it took us 10+ minutes to give our server our drink order (a bottle of wine)....then another 10+ minutes for him to come back with the bottle of wine.  After sitting for over 20 minutes before we took our first sip of wine... we were really trying not to be irritated.  However, after ordering then receiving our apps, I had to finally ask/grab a staff member to please take our  menus stacked on the already very crowded table.  Then after the apps were finished and the dishes were piled up in the middle of our small table for at-least 10 minutes... I had to ask a server/busser again to take the dirty dishes from our table.  The food (Salmon & short ribs) was just okay.  Coming from the NW...if you have to cover the salmon in that much sauce...your usually trying to hide the fishiness (I still could taste it).  Would not recommend sitting by the lawn...you could not hear the music and there were no misters.  Overall, when you spend almost $150 on one meal...you would like to be matched with experienced servers.   They really  need to spend more time training all their staff (bussers and neighboring servers) on how to be friendly and attentive to all guests.",

The only weird part was the waiter - he seemed to completely forget what you said. Not just a little - but totally. I asked him if I could have something else besides fried onion rings with my filet. Whatever else, maybe just more vegetables. 'Of course!', he said. My filet came out with the onion rings. I took a bite - but still not a fan of onion rings. The waiter didn't come by while I was eating, so I couldn't tell him. When he came to get the plate, he asked if I want another glass of wine. I asked him (kind of jokingly) if he would give me a glass of wine in exchange for the onion rings that I got and didn't want. He looked at me having no clue. \"Um ... you didn't like them?\" - \"Um. No. I didn't want them.\" He did not remember, not at all. \"Of course, I'll get you another glass of wine for that\", he said. Nothing happened, he never brought the wine. Twenty minutes later he came by again: \"Do you want another glass of wine?\" I nodded and gave up, paid for everything. Whatever. Good food. STRANGE service.",

I ordered the tenderloin and it was cooked perfectly, however, it came with a strange, fruity glaze sauce - not what I was expecting. My friend told me that his lamb shank was over-cooked. So I would say that this place is high on potential, but the execution could be improved. With that said, you cannot beat the ambiance, as it has to be one of the best outdoor patios in the Phoenix/Tempe area.",

We had the roasted chicken, which didn't really taste like any chicken I'd ever eaten.  It had an overcooked soft texture (you know like when overcooked chicken sticks to your teeth??) and It tasted like it had been marinated for a couple days in some very salty beef broth - - I'm not sure how to really explain it better than that.  My husband had the same thing and he was more than disappointed also.    Six of us shared three different desserts, and they were way funky in the combination of flavors.  I swear the S'mores dessert had parmesan cheese in it.  The goat cheese cheesecake was somewhat edible, but only if you ate one of the berries with it, and as long as you didn't get a bite of the sauce, which my friend's husband thought tasted like it had rosemary in it???  Really??  The apple dessert had melted cheese on the plate.  Whatever!!!   This place is definitely not for everybody, only  those willing to try funky, out-there combinations and willing to spend $$$$.  The only thing that would have made it worse is if I had to pay for my own dinner that night.  Wow, would I be ticked!!!  Service seemed slow but that may be by design to get you to drink more maybe??",

She gave us excellent wine recommendations that complemented our meals exquisitely, and she also threw in a lesson about gin and tequila, thanks!! I got the duck breast which was perfectly tender and succulent, my girlfriend got the lamb shank which was equally tender and flavorful. Yes it is expensive, but what do you expect? I can't rate it 5 stars because I feel that they are not doing anything different than any other high end fancy restaurant, but that should not deter you from stopping by, fr the ambiance alone.

Great food choices that aren't offered on the standard menu. The hours are very limiting, and you can only sit in the extremely small bar area, so you have to be there early to get in on the HH menu. The artichoke dip and the bruschetta were wonderful!!!   Dinner Review: We chose outdoor seating under the beautiful trees near the fireplace. It is such a romantic place for an evening out with the one you love! Our server was fantastic and had great suggestions! The mussels were some of the BEST I ever had - they were served in a wonderfully creamy chorizo sauce w/ yummy toasted bread for dipping. For entrees, we had the ahi wellington and the rabbit. The ahi was a little underwhelming - the presentation was gorgeous, but slightly bland. The wasabi mash fondue was just mashed potatoes with an extremely small smidge of wasabi - nothing really fondue or wasabi about it. The rabbit is one of their house specialties - it was absolutely delish! The only downside to the bunny is that it wasn't cooked until it was falling off the bone, which just isn't acceptable for a place like this. For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake - it was dense and not very ooh or ahh inspiring - I've had better.  My take is that this place is great for ambiance and almost there for food, but something's missing. I expected every plate to be amazing, and was a little let down with the final delivery. I will probably go back again, but it's not my top pick for the money shelled out. I would much rather go back to Chelsae's Kitchen or Cafe Monarch.",

First, we were running late for our reservation, and they were very nice about it.  When we arrived, we decided to sit outside.  After deciding our table was both too close to a rather large group and in too warm a location, the hostess happily moved us somewhere quieter and more comfortable.  The ambiance is very nice, and it is a great place for a romantic date.  We ordered a couple of delicious drinks (the \"Spring Chicken\"), ate some of the very good bread, and started discussing the menu.  The manager (we later learned his name is Kirk) was busing a table and overheard us and asked if we had any questions.  This turned into the best luck of the night because Kirk, after asking a few important questions, was able to direct us to a couple of outstanding dishes.   Most significantly, he strongly recommended trying the beef tenderloin \"charred rare,\" which (from what I recall of his description) involves searing the steak on a very hot grill and baking it briefly so the whole thing is heated through.  The result is an amazingly tender, delicious steak with the consistency of a \"toasted marshmallow\" (again, Kirk's word).  Neither my husband nor I like our steak bloody, but Kirk assured us that this would convert us, and he was right.  The steak was insanely good - very tender, quite rare, but not at all bloody.  We also tried an asparagus, spek, and poached egg salad on a brioche crouton, which was very nice, and a fried fromage with strawberry preserves and ciabatta that was good, but too rich and sweet to finish.    Kirk came back later to make sure we'd enjoyed the food, and insisted on buying us dessert.  We were too full (and the cheese and strawberry preserves were a good dessert substitute), but he sent a slice of Pumpkin Cheesecake home with us (I still haven't had room to try it, but my husband said his bite was delicious).    We were very impressed by the ambiance, the service, the food, and by Kirk, who clearly knows his stuff and believes in the food they serve.  We will certainly be making the trip down to Tempe again to eat here.",

    "text": "Freakin' awesome. Best apology dinner ever!....just kidding.  We started with something called \"tombo\" which was seared tuna encrusted with black sesame seeds and black pepper. I am a little squeamish about eating things that have mushy/gushy/floppy textures so I was scared before trying it but it was INCREDIBLE. We engulfed that immediately and only waited briefly before getting our meals.  Not only were the meals beautifully plated but they blew both of our minds. I believe my boyfriend got the beef tenderloin with horseradish whipped potatoes, sauteed spinach, and bacon onion jam. The jam sounds...terrifying but apparently it was good. I ordered the Tagliatelle pasta with sausage, tomatoes, and goat cheese. Not being a big goat cheese fan unless I'm in Paris, the giant glob of cheese was a little intimidating but easily defeated. I looooove basil so it was a phenomenal recipe.  I am so impressed with this place. Expensive yes, but you get what you pay for. Not to mention the patio and seating area is gorgeous. As I read in a previous entry--its the type of environment that could be perfect for a proposal or just having drinks with friends.",

We had some friends in town and were meeting some people.  He asked me to \"yelp\" something on Mill about 1 minute before we left for the game.  So, we headed to House of Tricks thinking it was going to be a really great bar.... maybe a coyote ugly type place given the name!  However, this place is like going to an excellent attorney named Bambi. We were amazed by the atmosphere cute house, super patio, and very elegant with linen table clothes.  The service was very helpful, thanks Ben.  So, when we began to order we didn't want a three course meal.  So we ordered for seven of us a few entrees to split.  We had Korean ribs, pumpkin goat cheese ravioli, a cheese plate, and two of their pizzas (note you can only order these in the bar).  Then I asked Ben if we were missing anything and he said the pork loin was very good.  Ummmm, it was the best I have ever had.  It was cooked to perfection with a nice fruit compote over blue cheese bacon scalloped potatoes.  Really, one of the best meals I have had in Phoenix.  I see House of Tricks moving up to a five star for me.  I just couldn't commit on the first visit.",

We had a little bit of difficulty finding the place.  I don't know how many times I have been down to Mill Ave in the 12 years I have lived in Arizona (100?) and never knew this great restaurant was tucked on a side street not far away.   The atmosphere at the restaurant is one of my favorite ever.  I love the outdoor seating with the grass, trees and fire pits.  I love the patio bar that is built around the trees growing through it.  I love the year round Christmas lights decorating the bar area.  My husband and I showed up without a reservation on a Friday night.  We were lucky to get the last table in the bar area to sit at.  The cheese plate lived up to my expectations- it was the most beautiful and best tasting cheese plate I have ever had.  The wine menu has an amazing selection of wines in every different price range.  We shared a bottle of Shiraz that ran us $29, I think.  We enjoyed the wine and cheese over a two hour period of conversation and relaxation.  I enjoyed it very much.  Now my husband laughed when the bill came and $50 later he was still starving.  We hit Filibertos on the way to pick the kids up from the babysitter so he could grab an adobado taco.  :)",

The lamb was underwhelming but their beef tenderloin was absolutely delicious both times.  Their portions, like other people have mentioned, are tiny for the price--the 'sides' seem more like just a way to plate the dinner instead of actually being the dinner.  Their bread basket is also piddly, that is to say we were still hungry enough to order dessert after dinner.  We got the caramel apple bread pudding (to die for!) and their white chocolate raspberry cheesecake.  The cheesecake was delicious until I came across a big chunk of something white in it.  I got excited, thinking it was a piece of white chocolate...but it was actually just a big glob of unmixed cream cheese--yuck.  So I guess if I want fabulous steak (and nothing else) in a great atmosphere, this is where we'll come.",

Anyway, the outdoor dining is beautiful and well decorated providing nice, romantic ambiance.  It helped that the weather was perfect also.  Lot's of trees make you forget Mill Ave. is just 1 block away.  The wine selection was impressive, even to a n00b wine drinker (luckily our friends are pros).  My friend selected a a bottle with the very helpful and knowledgeable assistance of our waitress.  I can be a real pain in the butt at restaurants because I don't eat wheat or dairy but they were more than accommodating and allowed me to select a meat and then created a dish around my requirements.  Always a nice touch.  Now to the food.  I had the rack of lamb and thought my plate was excellent.  I am by no means a Lamb connoisseur and this was probably the 3rd time I have ever eaten it (don't know why, just always ate cow and fish) and the first time at a nice place but none the less, taste buds don't lie!  It was definitely very good, but I can't say it was fantastic, I just don't have the history to compare it to.  My better half, however, was not impressed.  She had the Ahi Tuna and said it was \"just ok\".  This is why I gave it 4 stars not 5.  Now I never order Ahi Tuna at a nice place because I feel it always tastes the same... in other words it's usually prepared the same the the fish is so pronounced the taste from spot A is never much different than spot B and I always left feeling disappointed and wishing I had ordered something else, especially if I paid a lot of $$ for it...... so I stopped ordering that dish at nice places.  Anyway, I recommend this place, but it is expensive.  For four dinners, a bottle of wine, appetizers, and 2 glasses of wine it was about $350 for 4 people.",

With every item, expect a unique take on classics, what might be a simple turkey cheddar melt is turned into a totally new sandwich, making it impossible to order anywhere else without in inevitable comparison.  When they have the raspberry ice tea, get it, real crushed raspberry in your glass is the perfect county club touch to complete your experience.  Lastly, the service is excellent and friendly every time.  The staff is always ready to recommend the right wine and always seem to be right there when your glass runs dry.  When the temperature is right, the patio is a great place to dine and the table linens really give it that upscale, but very welcoming feel.

The ambiance was nice, but that was it.  We went here for dinner, which is priced than their lunch menu.  We asked our unfriendly server for a recommendation - she recommended just about everything.  That should have been the first bad sign.  We ended up ordering the seafood salad and halibut, along with  one glass of red wine.  No complimentary breadsticks or anything waiting for the food to come out.  Red wine came out chilled - who does that?  Portions were SMALL, but that was a good thing since the food was so bad.  Seafood salad was extremely fishy - was not fresh seafood.  I know we are in Arizona, but for the price, I assumed the seafood was fresh.  Wrong.  Salty as well - maybe a to preserve the seafood longer?  Fish was dry and either overlooked, or not fresh.  There are some good restaurants in phoenix metro (granted North Tempe has limited selection for nice ambiance and food), but to is not worth the money.  Out tab came to $70 and I would have been disappointed with the food even if it was $10.  Other than ambiance and decorating plates to make things look pretty, this fails the palette.",

They try hard and put some interesting ingredients together for the attempt at fine dining that you'd expect here but miss the mark. Our food that looked so good arriving to table fell short in any type of surprised goodness. And for a place that says they are huge on wine, when I ask for a bold red, oaky and spicy, you probably don't want to suggest the Pinot",

One of Tempe's gems that we can all hope will not be gentrificated out of existence (I'm looking at you Tempe City Council!).   This little setup of a yard between two little houses holding a bar between them is truly a place of solace in the valley. It always seems to be cool at Tricks (probably because they smartly close for most of the summer).   I have been here for lunches, nights of drinking, a wedding reception and even a fancy work dinner party. They seem to be able to deliver on the small or large scale with aplomb and style. Truly a feat to be lauded down the block from Mill where those words have little meaning.   Be sure to go on a winter night when they have the fireplace going. It feels like you are transported to somewhere that has winters!",

We had a 3 month old baby with us, so I requested a table along the perimeter, thinking that if he cried or fussed, it be less intrusive.  I was told no perimeter tables were available, although I observed a number of them that were unoccupied.  We were seated dead center, so I guess they didn't care about my request. Anyway, on to the food.  We all enjoyed our meals, but two weeks later I can't remember what I ate, so I guess it wasn't that memorable.  The restaurant, which is very close to ASU, is very old and appeared to be in need of some updating.  It was a great experience because of the people I was with, but I would not choose to eat at House of Tricks again.",

The crab cakes were great, the cheese and fruit platter was pretty good, Wifey had the beef tenderloin, exceptional... and so on. Even the mussels were great. Service was fair to good, atmosphere was just OK... Not too hip of a place, and I am not a fan of dining outside, but it seemed to work for us at this place. Overall, it's rare I give out the coveted five star rating, but this place had a lot going for it- Creative menu, neat setting, and much more. Try it out!",

You have to pay for parking but, even then it is packed. Not just for the restaurant.But, for all the other things going on there, such as the University. The Restaurant its self is lovely. An old house that is very charming. I have been here before so I want to say it is about 23 or 24 years at this location. The menu was magnificent. Lots to choose from. I got the steak salad and my friend and I shared a wonderful chocolate cake with ice cream dessert. We sat outside and it was a beautiful day. I was glad we got there some what early because, we got a very nice table. It filled up very quickly after 12 noon. rest room is clean ,and it is so much like being in someones home!",

    "text": "Here I go writing ANOTHER five star review.   What can I say, other than I try to spend as much of my time as I can hanging out at great places.  BACKGROUND   So, now on to House of Tricks...  I was originally turned on to House of Tricks by my father years ago, who is a True gourmand. He is always excited to show me a restaurant with an inventive menu which successfully combines foods that aren't traditionally known to go together, especially one full of fresh, delicate sauces. Over the years, House of Tricks has become one of our regular hangouts, and I always have had perfect dining experiences.  HOUSE OF TRICKS: THE HISTORY   Robin and Robert Trick met when they worked together at a Phoenix restaurant, called The Bandersnatch, where she was the manager and he was the chef. They decided to go out on their own and bought an old run down 1920's cottage that was a blue-print shop on 7th Street, just a couple blocks East of Mill Avenue. They opened House of Tricks in 1987. In 1994, they added and remodeled the historic adobe structure next door, more than doubling their space.   House of Tricks is now an oasis in the middle of Tempe, with a wooden deck, outdoor bar and patio, with loads of potted plants and flowers, mainly cared for each morning by Robert's mom, Mary Trick.  HOUSE OF TRICKS: THE MENU  The contemporary American menu is created by the staff and chefs, Scott Umscheid and Andrea Bales. The menus are seasonally inspired and changed regularly. Lunch, happy hour and dinner are served Monday through Saturday from 11am - 10am, and they are closed on Sunday.  Examples of the menu include these current appetizers:  ~Artisan Cheese Plate with Seasonal Fruit (see pic)  ~House Smoked Salmon with Lemon Crema, Red Onion, Avocado and Capers  ~Green Chili Chorizo Oysters with Sweet Corn Buerre Blanc and Tart Honey Glaze  ~Seared Diver Scallops with Cauliflower Puree, Sauteed Baby Carrots, and Root Beer Gastrique  ~House Made Squid Ink Pasta with Whole Tiger Shrimp, Calamari, Grilled Mexican Sweet Corn and  Jalapeno Tomato Fish Fumet  ~Smoked Texas Wild Boar with Lime Whole Grain Mustard Barbecue Sauce, Bourbon Glazed Sweet Potatoes, Flour Tortillas and Anaheim Chili Slaw  ~Seared Free Range Pork Belly Confit with Black Bean Chilequile, Roasted Jalapeno Emulsion, and Corn Honey  ~Harissa Spiced Mussels with Charred Tomato, Chorizo, and Creamy Sweet Cilantro Vinagrette  ~Seared Jalapeno Goat Cheese Grits with Mixed Mushroom Confit, Fresh Seasonal Vegetables and Watercress Pistou   ~Foie Gras and Anise Cinnamon Sopapilla with Vanilla Mango Broth, Pomegranate and Lime Crema  ~Smoked Korean Style Baby Back Ribs with Spicy Red Chili Paste and Barley Pickled Cucumber Salad  ~Ahi Tuna Tartare with Balsamic Glazed Asian Pears, Toasted Almonds, Horse Radish and Grilled Baguette   The entrees are equally spectacular, most with amazing sauces and all equally creative and delicious.   There are also soups, salads, sandwiches, and desserts. Needless to say, they are all equally impressive. Please check their website: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhouseoftricks.com&s=99b866a6a771da982361e8b7f40e7121d525fbe2087566a29f538013510b38de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">houseoftricks.com</a> to see the full menu.  HOUSE OF TRICKS: THE WINE  Drinks include a bar and extensive wine list.  House of Tricks has been named \"One of the Top 5 Wine Bars in the Valley\" and Wine Spectator \"Award of Excellence\" for the past 2 years, so you can be confident you will be pleased with any selection.  House of Tricks has won Trip Advisor's Certificate of Excellence Hall of Fame, is Arizona Republic food critic Howard Seftel's Top 5 Restaurants in East Valley, have won countless other awards and are featured in numerous publications.  CONCLUSION  5/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Over the years, the Tricks have acquired an impressive art collection that is displayed for guests to view throughout the compound.  *Parking is metered out front or in the nearby underground parking.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhouseoftricks.com&s=99b866a6a771da982361e8b7f40e7121d525fbe2087566a29f538013510b38de\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">houseoftricks.com</a>",

The mussels are a MUST have!!  It's to die for- ask for extra bread to sop up the amazing broth. Also had the Korean ribs and tuna tartare. I was a bit apprehensive about having tuna tartare in AZ but it was super yum!  The ribs were perfectly seasoned and was fall off the bone.   I can't believe I had the nerve to order a salad- okay I split it with someone but still... and entree. I had the blueberry and corn with kale salad. Very good!  And had the duck breast as an entree. The duck breast was very good although, not my favorite compared to others.   To top off the night, we had two desserts- bread pudding and strawberry balsamic ice cream with shortbread. The latter was my favorite!    This is definitely a must go to place!",

    "text": "I can say that Tricks is my favorite restaurant in the valley. Set like a jewel amidst the greenery, the restaurant is in one of the old charming houses that used to line this street when I went to ASU, in the seventies, though the house itself looks from the 1930's. Other than a charming location and atmosphere, the food is wonderful and reasonably priced for a fine dining experience. The servers are professional and personable, and seem like they actually like their jobs--not always the case in restaurants and a surly server can ruin a wonderful meal. I've been to wine tasting events, and celebrated my birthday at Tricks numerous times. It's perfect for special celebrations and a casual happy hour. It is my \"go to\" place for any occasion.",

    "text": "This is an upscale restaurant near the ASU campus. The ambience is wonderful, especially when seated outside. We got a large table on a very pleasant Arizona evening and although we were in a large group we never seemed cramped for spaced.   I ordered the mango chili margarita which I usually don't because I find such drinks too heavy. Contrary to expectations, it was actually very light and flavorful. The chili pepper on the rim was an excellent complement.   For starters I got the fois gras. This was quite disappointing. The sauce accompanying it just did not work well and some of the pieces were too fried and chewy.    For dinner I got the lamb chops. These were excellent --- juicy and well herbed --- simply delicious. The only issue was that I had ordered them medium rare and they were closer to rare so a bit cold, but still delicious.   Overall a great restaurant for a business meal or a night out.",

It felt private and secluded despite being very close to Mill and University. There was even a cute tuxedo colored cat on site, named Shrimp! The two of us ordered off of the Valentine's menu, but everything sounded delicious. The reason why I am giving three stars is because all of our dishes came out lukewarm from appetizers to dessert. The flavors were alright, but didn't live up to their full potential due to the temperature at which the food was served. However, kudos to our server - she was friendly and attentive! Although we maybe could have told her about the temperature of our dishes, we knew how busy they were this weekend and decided not to bring it up...so partly our fault. Overall, it wasn't a bad dinner, but it certainly didn't feel memorable.",

Service is very attentive and can discuss anything on the menu: food, cocktails and the wine list! We started with the cheese plate. The different types of cheese and the lightly toasted baguettes were perfect! Salad was next. We both got the specialty salads before our entree. Yum.  I got the risotto and felt it was a bit over cooked and a little salty...but I've eaten here before and will chalk it up to a bad night.   This place has great food,  beautiful surroundings and great service.  You can't go wrong!",

We decided to sit outside, and although the temperature was about 110, it was comfortable and lovely dining outside. You feel like you're on vacation somewhere tropical, although you're in urban Tempe.  But what you really want to know about is the food. We started with the mussels. Probably the best dish I've eaten in a long time. The mussels were tasty, but the sauce is what made it spectacular. I couldn't stop sopping the bread in the chorizo, onion, tomato sauce. It could have been a soup!!  We had the ahi tuna for dinner and who doesn't want something served on a potato pancake! Delicious!  And for dessert (it was a birthday celebration after all) we had the apple bread pudding. What a wonderful combination of flavors.  So here's the bottom line...one of my new favorite restaurants in the area. Their food preparation is spot on for me. The flavors are sophisticated yet comforting. Not upitty at all.  We will be back, thank you for a wonderful evening!",

When I arrived I felt like I had gone back home to the South, there are fountains, greenery, and the fact that the restaurant is in old houses lends to it feeling cozy and comfortable.    The menu was even better.  We ordered the Korean Short Ribs and the Scallops as appetizers and were not disappointed in either.  I liked the scallops so much I would have ordered them again for dinner.  For dinner we ordered the pork and sea bass.  I had the pork and the mustard sauce was amazing! I wanted to take a bottle of the sauce home with me to have later on!    Cannot wait to come back for their \"hours of tranquility\" aka happy hour.  Love it!",

One of those rare restaurants that really makes an effort to deliver an excellent dining experience, from the ambiance and seating to the incredible service to the original and always-changing plates they serve.   Most recently, my boyfriend and I went for an anniversary. We had the Rabbit Terrine to start off - it was delicious and definitely enough for two people to share (and get full from!). Our waitress recommended some great wines to go with our entrees (Jidori chicken and the fish of the day), and we ended our meal with coffee and cheesecake - I do have to say one thing about the cheesecake: the lavender-infused graham cracker crust was AMAZING!   We'll continue to make House of Tricks our spot for celebrations and special occasions - always a great experience!",

    "text": "8/6/13    The setting is very nice, and the menu sounds wonderful.  I had:  The Bison tartar for an appetizer and  Halibut with roasted carrot, roasted orzo and wilted chard  The last time I had steak tartar it was at Maison Robert-  it was traditional with eggs and caper and was out of this world.  I realized this appetizer was going to be completely different, and it was.  The bison was sort of dry and the main flavor was salt.  Honestly, the whole grain mostado with pickled onions on the toast was better than the tartar, and it was about a teaspoon in size.  For a $50 meal with tax I don't mind small portions, but I expect to be dazzled with flavor.  Likewise the halibut was lacking in flavor.  It was cooked well, and tasted fresh, but I enjoyed the orzo and chard more.  I think I noticed a hint of fennel in the orzo, which I will try at home, so at least I learned an alternative preparation.  The service was about what you can expect these days as the waitstaff talked to one another (it was later in the evening about 40 minutes before they closed when I checked out), and they were attentive.    In the days when 20-25% tips are expected, and the majority of reviews rave about the food, I want to be objective.  I'm rating House of Tricks based on their prices reflect fine dining.  Maybe I ordered poorly, but I chose items that I typically wouldn't cook myself and sounded different than I could get elsewhere. The food was by no means awful it just lacked pizazz.",

The big trees make for a hidden, romantic patio, and almost makes you feel like you are not in Arizona anymore!! I ordered a White Spanish wine, it was very good. Although it did not go with the Filet I ordered! I believe I ordered it Medium Rare and it was more along the lines of Rare, but I refused to bring it back! It melted in my mouth! The fish was perfect though! I love how the menu is always different!!! I recommend House of Tricks for a Romantic Dinner, anniversary Dinner, or birthday!",

    "text": "For the longest time, I wondered what trick this place must have been using to be so successful in such an odd location.  When I was a student at ASU I walked past House of Tricks on my way from Campus to Mill Ave countless times, and I always thought it was out of place.  While even as a student I could appreciate the beauty of a house converted into a restaurant with an amazing garden patio as its setting, it just seemed odd that a such a fancy restaurant was hidden on small street, just feet from a college campus, surrounded by parking meters and pay lots.  Now that I have eaten at House of Ticks, I understand its charm.  A while back, my girlfriend mentioned that she had a great happy hour at at this place  with friends some years ago.  She couldn't remember the name, but based on her description I instantly knew she was talking about House of Tricks.  So, when we went to see \"Wicked\" at Gammage (great show, by the way) for her birthday, I decided it would be the perfect place to dine before seeing the show.  Turns out that's what a lot of people do.  The server even asked if we were heading to the show, so he knew to get us out with time to spear.  We also happened to overhear another server mentioned that about 90% of their customers on a given night were heading over to Gammage.  The food is quite pricy, but very tasty.  I had the Ancho Chili Seared Ahi.  The orange-chipotle honey aioli had a good kick.  The white bean chili had a unique taste.  The tuna it self was perfectly seared, but no too flavorful.  My girlfriend had a salmon dish which was amazing.  The salmon was very flavorful and cooked perfectly.  For dessert (we were celebrating a birthday, after all) we tried a brioche bread pudding.  One word: Wonderful.  If you are looking for a pleasurable meal with a pleasurable ambiance, House of Tricks will do the trick.  I highly recommend it before a show at Gammage or if you are just looking a romantic night out.",

Rustic bread toasted and covered in goat cheese and heirloom tomatoes.  Yummy!  We also ordered onion dip and homemade potato chips and an artichoke dip-both were also good.  I think there might have even been a fourth dish.  I think wine was $2 off a glass for happy hour.  I was here for dinner a few years ago and unlike Ada G, everything was perfect.  I had the loup de mer that night.  I don't remember what my husband or his coworker had but everything was perfect.  I do remember that for the appetizer we had ahi three way and that was really good too.    The best part about House of Tricks is their beautiful outdoor dining.  There aren't many places around with such a nice garden area.  It's a nice treat to be able to eat outside under the trees with the little white lights overhead.",

I can't remember the name of the fish but it was a flakey white fish on crispy potatoes.  We paired it with a local red wine. The service was excellent as well. Our server explained to us the order of tasting and pouring wine after my husband asked how do you determine who tastes and who gets the 1st glass poured. Didn't expect to learn something at dinner! We will definitely return!",

Since we just got off a plane, we were starved and had to ask 4 times for a plate of bread, which they promptly charged for. Not a big deal but considering the entrees were wildly overpriced, you would think you would get some bread for free. Our server was completely awol most of the night. Our appetizer came out in a decent amount of time but then the entree's were crazy late.   A couple next to us who ordered the same things, arrived one half hour after us, yet were served 40 minutes before us.  They put us at a table that in a location that should not even have a table.  Right in front of the kitchen where they bring the food out with a wet floor, restrooms right there, and pots and pans banging, drops, etc.  Then they had another door to the front that was opened and closed probably a thousand times that creaked annoyingly all nite.  A couple squirts of wd40 would have fixed easily this irritation.  Chicken was dry but the other 2 entrees were ok, but by this time we were pretty much done with this place.  Finally, another waiter who could tell we were distressed tried to help us out by offering to fill our drinks, offer desserts, etc.  We just told him we wanted the bill.  He then went to our original waiter, who was processing  the bill and talked to him.  We thought there would be some sort of discount after all this, but NO!!  Full price!  Way overpriced, $30 for half a chicken and $30 for meat loaf.  Sorry, but no amount of magic will make us return to House of Tricks.",

I had the ahi tuna which was prepared perfectly, that had like a tasty potato pancake underneath. The slaw on top was good but very spicy, seemed to have wasabi in it. My girlfriend got the steak which she enjoyed as well. The creme brulee was also a great way to end the meal.  While the food was very good, it was the exceptional service and setting that made this meal so memorable. Our waiter was one of the best I have ever had- happy to explain some menu options to us, attentive but not overbearing, and was happy to take multiple pictures of us after the meal.   The setting (request outdoor) is incredible and romantic. I was very glad to choose this place as the special dinner of the weekend on my vacation.",

Yesterday's lunch was no exception to the great food, service, and ambience I've experienced at Trick's over the years.  The fresh smoked salmon Caesar salad recommended by our lovely server  was mouthwatering, to say the least. My dining partner and I shared an espresso gelato for dessert which was the perfect finish. This culinary experience is enough to entice me back to downtown Tempe again and again.",

I made reservations and we got there early and they were able to seat us outside where it was quite lovely! Our server was very attentive (at first) and helped us finally decide on the Scottish salmon and seared ahi plates. Unfortunately, after we placed our order we didn't see her again until our plates were empty!   I've had many types of salmon, but I believe this was the first time I tried Scottish salmon -- which from what I had must mean slightly dry and salty salmon cooked well. The ahi plate was descent, not as good as Kona grill... We both could've used double the amount of sides but that's how it goes sometimes.   Again, great atmosphere and ambiance, the food was just so-so.",

Upon first glance, I was pleasantly surprised. It looked cozy, romantic, inviting and trendy. We sat outside on the patio so we could enjoy the nice weather and people watch. I ordered the Tandori Salmon and my husband ordered the Pork Volcano Shank. He would not stop raving about his meal. Mine was delicious as well, but if I ever return, I want to try the gnocci. Prices were a little high, bill came to just around $100 (2 glasses of wine, a cheese plate appetizer, and 2 entrees). However, still affordable and a great place to celebrate a special occasion. Service was excellent as well. At the end of the meal, our waitress surprised us with 2 glasses of champaign to celebrate our anniversary. It was a great way to end the night.",

I think 4 is a good rating, but would do 4.5 if that was an option.  The bartender flopped on making me an old fashioned, but was apologetic and took it off my tab right away.  Problem solved.

The outdoor seating is beautiful, we were shown a center seating, we weren't happy so moved inside. Outdoor is definitely not recommended during summer or if you want to have a nice time. The ambiance is lovely and one star goes for it.   They have very interesting cocktail selections and a whole list of wine. We decided to go with Kiwi Sangria and a jim beam based cocktail. It was delicious, perfect drink and price was spot on. We ordered smoked salmon and vegetarian jalapeno peas mushroom starter. Salmon was cooked to perfection and the smoked flavor was amazingly good. The vegetarian dish had a very good flavor, mushroom was spongy and juicy like the way we like. Highlight of the evening was the Lamb rack. Phew!! Thats one hell of a dish. We prefer well done and it was the best lamb we have had in a long time. We have tried at The Ivy in chandler, Red at Santa Monica Pier but this one beat them all. The meat was juicy had absorbed the salt, the crunch flavor on top of the ribs impressed me.   We love this place, I removed one star for not having any option in the poultry section. There was no chicken or turkey. That was a little disappointing. Apart from that everything was good. Yes, price is definitely on the higher side, but they are running a offer all this August 20% off your bill. That just made our evening.   Would highly recommend it and will definitely go back again.",

I had no problems with parking but the times we went could be considered odd or off hours. Other reviewers have documented that they had parking issues. We just parked right across the street. If we were not suppose to park there, \"could have fooled me.\" I never saw a sign that said, \"ASU Parking Only, Subject To Towing.\" One time we just walked in from Mill. I guess we got lucky.    The outside patio is so, so quaint, and the food is delish! The prices are not cheap and I heard even more for dinner, and the service is slower. It reminds me of a \"Ladies Who Lunch\" or,  \"Do Tea\" place. I actually like the slower service pace. I go there only when that is okay for me. It can be very busy here since it is a smaller restaurant so be prepared.     The last time I went I had a fruit tea, they throw in real fruit, love it! I ordered the Grilled Chicken Sandwich with Capricho de Cabra Goat Cheese, Fig Jam, Bacon and Arugulaon Toasted Ciabatta. Served with Fresh Fruit &Greens with Rosemary -Balsamic Vinaigrette. The sandwich was good and the salad that came with it was wonderful, as well. My lunch friend said the food was spectacular! I think she got the Ahi Tuna or maybe the Salmon.",

    "text": "Haven't I reviewed this place before?!  I LOVE HOT!  Reason I came on this day is because a friend from Napa, CA was in town for shows and I brought her here last time she was in town and it was her request that we come again.  Like I said, I LOVE this place and you'll have a hard time getting me to decline.  However, on this particular visit I have to say my meal was just okay.  Generally it's fantastic but what I ordered just wasn't up to par.  I had the chicken and dumplings as my entree.  Again, everything else was very nice.  It was a very cold evening but we kept shuffling closer to the heat lamps and sharing our jackets, doing whatever was necessary to keep warm. So the meal I wasn't so satisfied with -the chicken was dry.  I prefer dark meat because it's moist, white meat is always risky because it gets dry and I can't choke that stuff down so easily unless you make it into a chicken salad.  Dry white meat = not great.  The dumplings were DEVINE and I want the recipe.  Mmm mmm MMMM!  Our server, Greg, was wonderful and was on top of the recommendations and descriptions. Suprisingly it was very busy on that chilly eve and that kept him busy too.  My guests from Napa, Oakland, and Paso Robles enjoyed their meal and the experience.  Hopefully they'll have an opportunity to come again when it's a bit warmer and we have more daylight hours to enjoy the views that surround.",

The bartender was very nice but extremely busy and the service was slow, she was the only bartender for the bar and the entire restaurant. After a drink we were taken to our table and given our menus. We order the mussels to start and then the yellowtail for our main dish. The mussels took a long time to come and then the sauce they were in was only slightly warm. We notice also the price of the mussels had increased to $16. We asked for more bread to go with the mussels and they stated they charged for more bread but we agreed to the fee (most restaurants that I have been to never charge for extra bread). The extra bread came out about 10 minutes later when we were pretty much done eating the mussels. The yellowtail came out about 5-10 minutes later and was extremely good. I have gone to this restaurant for close to 30 years and this just seemed like a lackluster performance.",

With that said I have found that restaurants that have a lot of reviews and still managing to get 4 and 5 stars despite a few negative ones says a lot.   I have lived in the Phoenix metro for 15 years now and have been frequenting this AMAZING restaurant the entire time. The atmosphere is as good as you will find in the Valley, and the food on both the lunch and dinner menu's is delicious. One of my favorite aspects of the restaurant is that at least twice yearly the menu completely changes. I really find this important because the menu is smaller and while I always find something interesting and delicious, because of the change, I'm never bored.   There have been times that I have stopped in for a drink and an appetizer wearing jeans and was seated next to a small group dining in tuxedo's, and there have been times that I was the one in the suit. Never once did I feel uncomfortable or out of place and NEVER have I regretted spending my hard earned money here.  Not to lie... I did have one bad meal... but I have been here at least 45 times over the years so dont be distracted by a negative review or two. You wont be dissapointed.  OHHH AND IF THEY EVER HAVE KEY LIME PIE ON THE MENU.... PLEASE DON'T GET IT, I'D HATE FOR THEM TO BE OUT WHEN I NEED A SLICE.",

The menu is eclectic and has a variety of choices for dinner, heavy on the meat side.  Each of the four people at my table ordered something difference, Osso Buco, the vegetarian bean dish, steak and chicken.   No one enjoyed their meal - there was no flavor at all in the vegetarian dish.  My guests didn't like anything.  The salad was lacking is variety with a little arugla on the place.

Really delicious and satisfying.  The pork pastrami sandwich was pretty to look at & delicious too.  Our reservations about ordering pork pastrami  were unfounded- sandwich was delicious- moist & stacked high with thinly sliced pork that held all the pastrami punch! The creamy white sauce drizzled over meat was incredible.  Service was efficient &  elegant without being stuffy.",

I had originally come here about ten years ago (this place has been around for nearly 30 years), so I couldn't tell you what my experience was then, but we finally decided to revisit it, and we're glad we did! Friendly staff, prompt service, great environment and setting (we even came to learn that they have three cats who basically live there! One of whom was hanging out with us, it seems, named Kinko). In any case, we had a few apps of course, my favorite being the Artisan Cheese Plate, but also Harissa Spiced Mussels , Smoked Texas Wild Boar and Seared Free Range Pork Belly Confit, all absolutely delicious! For entree, I had their Almond Crusted Rack of Lamb, and oh goodness was it amazing! I don't know that there are any other restaurants in Tempe  left to match the quality of House of Tricks, it brings fine dining to the heart of a busy college area without compromising their integrity. We'll certainly be back soon.",

We had the scallops for an appetizer, and there were only 2 pieces on the plate. The  fish I had was pretty much smaller than the size of my palm, and the ribs he had, well, was pretty underwhelming in portion as well. The flavors worked very well together, especially with the curry spices with my fish. It came to $110 and both of us were still hungry, yes, like starving still after dinner and hit up a fast food joint right after. I just can't see myself justifying in coming back just for the cost even though everything tastes great.  Definitely come here if you have money to burn and don't really have an appetite.",

The only time I cannot fathom loving this place is when it's too warm to enjoy the patio.  There's even a mascot!  We were visited by the official cat of the House Of Tricks and even though I'm not a big cat guy, this one was really sweet.  The cocktails were delicious and everything we ordered was really tasty.  The service was superiors and I only hesitate to give five stars due to price - this was not a cheap meal.  I think between the four of us it came to about $350.  Granted, we didn't hold back, and we were celebrating, but that's still rather steep.    It's tough to say whether or not I'll be back, but I won't say no if the group decides to do so.",

You're not going to find anything in Tempe that really competes on this level, as even the nicest places in Tempe are corporate balloon knots and do not offer a True fine dining experience like Trick's.  I went here with my lovely lady on a Friday night and posted up at the bar.  The bar is tits and it's outside with trees growing out of it.  It has this Swiss Family Robinson type of vibe that's really cool. The entire property is a couple of buildings and the patio/bar, and it's a cool setup.  The food selection is legit, with a hefty portion devoted to seafood.  We dove into the seafood and got an order of the scallops and an order of the mussels. The scallops were legit.  Cooked perfectly, presented beautifully and garnished thoughtfully.  The Mussels dish was also a winner: Mussels were fresh and cooked well, and the sauce was just awesome with the sausage in it.  I devoured it.  Overall, I couldn't see why anyone would give this place any less than 4 stars.  Go now and eat some scallops.",

Something I neglected to do, and we ended up being stuck in game traffic, re-routed around a bunch closed streets, and arriving 30 minutes late for our reservation only to have nowhere to park.  Luckily, there was an empty spot in the lot behind the restaurant, and they were still able to accommodate our reservation, so it all worked out in the end.  We chose this place because we wanted a fancy restaurant that wasn't a steakhouse or seafood place.  House of Tricks delivered.  Food was amazing.  Atmosphere is intimate and just what the husband and I were hoping for on our date night.    Although we'd been here to eat before, it was 6 or 7 years ago so I wasn't sure what to expect.  I will say that I enjoyed the outside ambiance of this visit much more than I did the inside ambiance I remember from the first visit.  It's just so pretty on the outdoor patio, especially in the evening when the weather is nice.  And despite the tree we sat under that kept dropping its giant flowers on me!  Just as we were finishing our meal, a large party was seated on the patio next to us, and I was immensely grateful that we were almost done, because they were very loud, drunk, and obnoxious.  One of the other hazards of eating there on game night!  We'll definitely be back.  Just not on game night!",

    "text": "Not one of the better choices at this price point. I had been wanting to try this place for a while due to the hype, but was a little disappointed. Nothing was bad, but nothing stood out either and if I'm paying $25 - $30 for an entree I expect the food to be pretty spectacular. I came here with a group of friends before a show at Gammage. My husband and I shared the soup special which was a white bean pork soup, the PEI mussels and the osso buco. To drink, my husband had the Franziskaner and I had the Green Thing and a margarita. The soup and mussels came out first. The mussels were good, but I've also cooked mussels as good as these. The soup was lukewarm, we should have sent it back but were with a group and didn't want to be bothersome and it was not as robust or flavorful as expected. They split the osso buco for us which was nice, but it wasn't one of the better osso bucos that I've had. The pork was cooked perfectly, but I felt that the sauce on it was too sweet and a little overpowering. It came with toasted white beans and sugar snap peas which I found to be a strange combo, a potato or other starch would have been better. The dish included gruyere, but the amount was so little that it didn't really add to the dish. My husband chose the flourless brownie for dessert and it was a bit on the dry side. I took one bite and it was good but not great, and not enough for me to want to waste the calories on. My favorite thing that I had was the Green Thing cocktail which had fresh cucumber and gin, it was delicious and very refreshing. The service was great and the ambiance was very nice, but I just didn't think the food was a great value for the price. I've had much better meals at this price point, so I could only see myself coming back here to enjoy the cocktails.",

It's quality meat, and goat cheese, bacon, and fig jam pretty universally take every sandwich from \"um, sure\" to \"oh, yes.\" The pistachio butter and jelly on a croissant is interesting, but is more of a novelty than a substantial lunch choice. The turkey club was least popular, but this shouldn't be an issue because you're ordering the grilled chicken sandwich, anyway [see beginning of paragraph.]  In terms of ambiance, I'd bring my grandma here before I brought a date, because the environment and the lunch plates are all detail-oriented and dainty, plus the feel is cute and cozy, even in 100+ degree heat.

Beer was good (pretty hard to mess up beer). Tortilla soup was really good, too salty, but still good. Ordered the Cornish game hen.  OILY DOES NOT MEAN MOIST.  Spinach was also soggy and oily. Overall disappointed.  100$ and wasn't feeling well when we got home. Mostly because I usually eat fresh and healthy on a regular basis.",

The lamb curry spring rolls (on special) were superb; the rack of lamb was delicious, and the squid ink pasta dish was delightful.  We also had a mixed green salad and a soup - both great.  We don't usually go for dessert, but this time we split a cappuccino (perfect!) and a peach/peanut butter tart, which was pretty unique.  Our waitress was wonderful - sweet, informative, and the right amount of attentive (she recommended the spring rolls & we were glad!).  I especially liked how each dish was served separately with time in between the courses.  I was also happy to find a truly nice and affordable red wine blend on the menu.  This time we sat indoors (so hot out there right now), and that was perfectly lovely, too.  Great experience!",

Drinks are inventive and tasty, the mussels with chorizo were brought back by popular demand and worth every piece of bread used to soak up the broth. Yesterday I had the red trout special, but have had their short ribs, salads, meatloaf and more.  My five star rating spans years of excellent dining.",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to try House of Tricks based upon other patrons' reviews. We were surely glad we did! First of all the restaurant itself is a nice little gem in amongst the ASU campus in Tempe. The outdoor garden patio area is very inviting with fans and misters for those brave enough to dine in the AZ August heat. We chose to dine indoors. The interior decor is quaint and very period-oriented (Victorian). There is a really nice cozy, non-pretentious feel to the restaurant. Our server, Naomi, was awesome: super sweet, very personable, helpful with suggestions on the wine list and the menu, and her service was timely and not rushed. My husband and I started our dining experience with a shared wild arugula salad...it was so delicious! The dressing was very light and didn't overpower the combination of arugula, oranges, dates, carrots and goat cheese...a refreshing start to our meal. We then shared the seared scallop BLT appetizer (the bacon jam was SO rich and yummy I could've eaten just this on toasted bread and have been satisfied...hint, hint)--very delicious. My husband chose the Grilled Salmon and I chose the Grilled Yellowtail as our entrees. Both looked and tasted scrumptious!!!  I don't care for salmon, but I took a taste of my husband's and liked it. I loved the combination of roasted squash and caramelized leeks with my yellowtail...perfection. After a short 'intermission' from all this delightful food, we chose the Salted Caramel apple bread pudding for our dessert (hint-do add the scoop of vanilla bean gelato for a more sinful treat!). It was a decadent delight to share!! (Couldn't finish this so we took it home for a treat later in the evening .) All of the dishes from beginning to end were presented so beautifully...kudos to the chef, who not only prepared tasty food but very tasteful as well! Perfect portions too. Our experience was an A++ all across the board. House of Tricks is now tops in our repertoire of restaurants for special occasions and date nights.",

The only reason I did not give 5 stars is that the room was incredibly loud.  There was a large, very noisy party of 10 or 12 next to us, and the room was small and had no sound buffering.",

The cheffiness of the menu also surprised me because as a downtown Tempe restaurant it doesn't seem like a place that would appeal to students' palate or budget.  But once we sat down and actually had to order from the cheffy menu, the impressed feeling died because no one could really find anything we really wanted to order. Once we finally ordered and tasted our food, we were all unimpressed with what we picked. Service also left a lot to be desired. Refills were hard to come by. Dirty plates sat on the table and we had to physically find our waitress to get a bill.    So overall I would say I am not interested in returning BUT the patio is beautiful and I would go back for drinks at the bar.",

We were seated promptly in a beautiful outdoor area.  Our water was delivered about 10 minutes later, but we did not have any contact with a server until we had been there about 25 minutes.  We were busy looking at the menu so it was not the end of the world.  We ordered drinks and those took another 15 minutes, we did not order anything special, wine and beer.  It was painfully slow!  Others around us seemed to be taken care of quickly, so not sure what the issue was. Our food finally arrived just after 6:30!  We had to get to our show, we had planned to walk so we really could not enjoy the meal, we had to eat fast. We had to request the check right when we got the food.  No time to even look at a dessert menu, which was really disappointing.  Great food, but lacking a bit in the service area.",

I strongly recommend you to order the mussels if you like shellfish. The waitress gave us some time in between the appetizer and main course, which was long but nice. It was nice that they did not bring all the food at once or shortly after we got our appetizer. We ordered duck and swordfish as our main entree. The swordfish was delicious, but lacked a little bit of flavor. The duck had so much flavor. They paired it with potatoes and beets. I almost licked my plate clean. We then ordered the flourless chocolate cake. Wow, delicious. The cake was rich, but paired with a cream, chocolate syrup and strawberries. The service was excellent, the restuarant was beautiful and the food was delicious. Overall, I would recommend this spot for a fancy date night.",

Idk but it was refreshing to have a server who really knew how to provide everything but not be interrupting.  The food! Crazy good.  We had prime rib and it was a huge portion. Our appetizer was this cheese thing, just delicious! Cocktails, they obviously have a mixologist, because our drinks were the bomb!  My was similar to a lemon drop, my husband had a pims cup, also tasty.  It was not a cheap meal, but it was worth it!",

I do wish the skin was more crispy but the meat was a perfect temperature. You didn't need to chew the duck it was soft and delicious!  The other highlight of our meal was dessert. The apple bread pudding was delicious it offered many different layers of flavor and it was soft and had different notes of flavor: tartness of the apple and sweetness from the caramel. You must do this with ice cream!  The menu I would say offers a cohesive mix of interesting entrees and small plates it has something for everyone.  This house exceeded my expectations and was a great place to dine. Would recommend others to come here.",

    "text": "I've been to House of Tricks many times, each time is better than the last.  House of Tricks is unlike any restaurant in Tempe, the tree coverage and the patio provides an awesome natural ambiance.  My father was in town and really wanted to come back here, the last time I took him here was three years ago. We sat on the patio, it was still 110 degrees outside but it was still cool somehow.   We started with the mussels and the poke. Both were phenomenal, the mussels with the chorizo may be one of my favorite dishes from any restaurant I've ever been to. I definitely recommend this dish to anyone.   For our entree we both got the sea bass, which was perfect. The sea bass was light and soft and cooked perfectly. The black beans, squash, tomatoes and avocado were a great compliment to the fish. This is one of my favorite sea bass dishes ever. Add the bottle of Malbec we were sipping on and it was a great meal.  I truly believe House of Tricks is the best restaurant in Tempe, by a mile.",

My hefe beer was excellent as was her drink - something with jalapenos is all I remember.  Definitely worth a visit!",

One waiter for our area (he was very nice, but they were obviously understaffed). It took FOREVER (I am not exaggerating) after we ordered to get our food. I was Ok with all that but my lunch portion which I paid 14.00 for was minuscule. I had to order a bowl of soup to sort of fill up. I seriously think there are better places for the money and the portions. Won't be going back there again.",

I got the steak and the husband got the tuna.  The food was good, not life changing by any means. However, all the food that came out again was not very hot. The table next to us had to find their server because the service was too slow for them. I liked the patio vibe of this location but I will not be back, as there is better dining choices in Phoenix. This restaurant is over hyped, I was disappointed.",

Now the eldest daughter is at ASU and we went down to visit on Sat afternoon for lunch and to senior girl. Hubby suggested House of Tricks and I wasn't even sure it was open for lunch. Checked Yelp and it was! AND there was a 20% off if you checked in. AND you could make reservations via Yelp. Decision made.   We arrived and were given a choice of a table inside or outside. Even though it was going to be well over 100 all of the shade from the beautiful trees and umbrellas and great misting system made us decide outside was the way to go.   The menu has so many things that sounded wonderful - it was hard for all of us to decide. AND they had both a white and a red wine by the glass for $6.   I got the salmon which was delicious. Cooked perfectly. Moist and flavorful. Served over a chive risotto cake, bed of mixed greens with cherry tomatoes, avocados and sweet red peppers. Yum!  Daughter opted for the daily special frittata with turkey, feta and tomatoes served with a side salad and a pile of fresh fruit. Another win. Hubby had the club sandwich which was wonderful. He opted for potato salad instead of pasta salad and it has bacon in it. He was very happy with his selection.   This place did not disappoint. It's $$$ on Yelp but I think that was more for dinner. Our lunch was very reasonable. Especially for finer dining - improved more with the 20% off. We will have to go have a special date night there again soon!  Nicely done house of Tricks - we will be back soon!",

The menu was a little bit different from other restaurants (especially the churros with Miso Caramel), so it stood out. I chose smoked pork belly+Branzino en Papillote+pineapple upside down cake,and my husband chose Fried Oyster+short rib+churros. The smoked pork belly was tasty and well-seasoned and I liked the sause with it. And I have to say, I am now a big fan of the Branzino en Papillote with corn and quinoa. What a perfect match!!! The pity was that the pineapple upside down cake was tooo sweet for me. But the churros were a big surprise!! The churros I had before were sweet and they were served with hot chocolate, but now I found wow Miso actually worked as well! Finally, the portion was huge, and I think the price was reasonable!",

Their prices warrant better service. Also waited inline for the men's room. Apparently a patron locked the door on the way out. Four guys were waiting to get in  (one holer). Manager finally came and opened the locked door.  Although I like the ambiance of this restaurant, the poor service and prices for what we got would make me very hesitant to go back there anytime soon even though the food was great. It isn't worth the hassle. Also called to see whether the restaurant could do something special like flowers or birthday cake for my twin sisters birthday. They couldn't -- referred me to a local bakery inTempe for a birthday cake,",

    "text": "This little gem off of Mill Avenue in Tempe is such a delight. The two houses merge together with a lovely tree-shaded patio. It's perfect for groups or couples. Our party of three sat outside watching the revelers attend the ASU/Stanford game as there was a private party going on inside the houses. No matter, the weather was perfect and the heaters were warm enough. Our service was fair, to be honest and I would have preferred a little more attention and information regarding the menu. The food was amazing though. The filet actually melted in our mouths and was perfectly seasoned. It sat atop a delicious mixture of cheddar grits and veggies. The halibut was also nicely done and very flavorful. The best part of this meal was the amazing bread pudding dessert. You cannot skip this one filled with apples and the flavors of fall. The red velvet chocolate mousse cake was also good, but the bread pudding was better. Very nice wine list accompanies and the cocktails are quite good - try the salted old fashioned for a unique twist on the old favorite.",

It was a smaller portion which made it hard to share because I wanted it all! I followed with the pork chop and he got the beef tenderloin. Again, we were not disappointed. For dessert we ordered the donuts which were probably my least favorite part of the meal. Not bad, but not great.  Our server was attentive and helpful and I really liked the atmosphere.

We were able to sit outside thanks to the gorgeous weather, and I'd recommend this to anyone.  The houses inside have their charm, but al fresco dining is great!    We had a few drinks at the bar before we started dinner - they have a fairly nice wine by the glass list, as well as a nice stocked bar.  Something for everyone!  The menu contained lots of delicious choices, and it was hard to choose.  Ended up going with Hapuku, which was a new-to-me fish from New Zealand, similar to grouper.  It was delicious - tender, flaky, and the earthy vegetables with it were a nice complement.  We had very polite service, though not well-timed.  I like when plates are cleared all at once for people, instead of taking plates at the table away when others are eating.  OR, bringing the bill before we've finished dessert.  Both of these happened here.",

The cozy little location makes you feel like you're out in the middle of the countryside, even though in reality you're steps from Mill Ave. Everyone - from the bartender to the host to the server - went way out of their way to make sure our meal went well.  I had the quiche special (chorizo & goat cheese) with a side of the soup of the day (califlower with basil) and both were out of this world.  Add in some stellar $6 by-the-glass wine specials and you've got a happy, happy camper.  I will definitely be back! One tip - I didn't realize they had a private parking lot behind the restaurant; so initially I parked on the street at a pay meter.  Save yourself the $0.50 and park back in the alley!  :)",

We had finished the first bottle between the 4 of us, and ordered a second, which didn't arrive until our entrees were on the table and being eaten before they got cold. Water glasses weren't refilled often enough. She did not mention the dessert special, I happened to overhear another server telling her table about it - she had just dropped off the dessert menus and run off. Food was fabulous as always, but at this fine restaurant, we've learned to expect better service. We'll be back, though, as we know how wonderful this gem really is.",

Seems like it should all be amazing for the price. I ordered my steak medium and it came out rare so I sent it back and it came back only slightly better but I ate it anyway. My husband and I both left there feeling sick. Later that night, I awoke to my husband violently vomiting. The food gave him food poisioning! I called the restaurant the next morning to make them aware of the situation and they took down my name and number and said the manager would call me back in a few days to make the situation right. We spent well over $100 on our food and I would have rather spent half that on a meal that didn't make my husband sick. We never heard back from them. No manager ever called. I really like to support local restaurants and really tried to give them a chance to make it right, but they just never did. I will not be returning to this restaurant.",

Their outside patio is gorgeous and complete with heaters and a fire pit when the weather is a bit on the chilly side. But the indoors is just as great-cozy little house with a fire place.

We were hungry when we arrived, and were never even given a bread basket.  We waited at our table for our meals while four other tables near us received their food, finished their meal, and paid and left the restaurant. And I have to be honest, our food when it did arrive wasn't spectacular.  I ordered the Sugar Cane Shrimp Salad - about 5 medium pieces of shrimp, tasty but overcooked, on a bed of mixed greens with a fairly flavorless dressing.  That's it.  My daughter ordered a Salmon Salad that came with a hefty fried risotto cake, so I ate half of that.",

The patio is always nice and the waitress was kind enough to make sure we stayed warm by moving another heater next to us, too bad she didn't smile much. The service and food were very good. The house wine was also very good for $6 a glass but the pour seemed a little on the skimpy side. I'm sure we will go back again.",

It's mouthwatering when i think back of it now even though it has been a few weeks since i was there. One minor point of critisism was the texture of the duck meat, which i found to be too soft. I recommend getting a seat in the yard, i was late and had a less optimal seat inside.",

    "text": "Since I moved to the Valley in August I have been on a journey to find the greatest locations with nice, quiet, laid-back atmospheres and House of Tricks quickly became one of my favorites. As a singer, I need places that are quiet and chill to go get a drink so naturally I quickly latched onto House of Tricks as a favorite for an evening drink. The bar itself is a very unique treat: outdoors in the round with trees built-in as part of the bar rather than torn down! When dining, a majority of the seating appears to be outdoors (which is fine because it has a fantastic patio) but I have sat inside and it is a wonderfully intimate atmosphere; built out of what appears to be a very old house-turned-restaurant. Very cool! I had a fantastic glass of wine and a Scottish Salmon that was served to perfection. Bravi to the staff of House of Tricks for creating a truly unique establishment that is sure to create regulars out of wanderers!  Keep singing,  -Jerron",

    "text": "Absolutely great each and every time. That's pretty much how I sum up Tricks.  Living nearby has given me good opportunities to visit Tricks for lunch and dinner, I've never been disappointed. Lunch is nice for something a bit classier that won't break the bank, their salads are fresh and crisp, the sandwiches are just enough to fill but not weigh you down (at least for me).  For those considering taking their family out for a nice quiet lunch, Tricks is a no worry choice. I've taken my family here on two separate occasions and even the picky Grandfather of the family had something he liked. (He's super hard to please) I would only steer clear on the hottest AZ summer days as the misters can only do so much. Or you could sit inside for some A/C action.  I'll agree that Tricks is a great date destination. It's the first mention when someone asks me where to go in Tempe for a nice date (with Caffe Boa just behind it). The wine list is comprehensive without being daunting and the dinner selections are borderline amazing. I've had several and again, not been disappointed. My favorite has been the Ahi Tuna Wellington, prepared perfectly and with served with nice presentation.  All in all, one of the best restaurants in Tempe and probably the Phoenix area. A few Tricks lunches in the Fall and Summer should be planned accordingly.",

    "text": "Have had lunch here on several occasions & it's been great but the recent experience was not quite so pleasant. A group of us decided to go there for dinner before a show at Gammage. It was restaurant week so we made reservations well in advance allowing plenty of time. We were never asked if we were going to a show. Service was incredibly slow and when we had not yet received appetizers 40 min after placing our order, we were starting to panic. When we finally caught our server we told her that we were attending a 7:30 performance and she seemed so surprised. Food came pretty fast after that but unfortunately, 5 out of 7 dinners were cold. I think the cold meals were all from the restaurant week menu. Too bad as the food was good. We barely finished and rushed out the door, just making it in time for the show. I am sure I will go back again but I think I will stick to lunch from now on. I found it surprising that they just didn't seem to be prepared for a Sat night with both restaurant week and a show at Gammage. Was this a surprise to them???",

Put aside the hard bread and frozen butter they start you with (its free so you can set it there) and the rest is a pleasure.  The Artisan Cheese Plate - this is such a winner!  It is a perfect appetizer to accommodate any of the entrees.  If you haven't gotten it yet, do.  They cook their fillet perfectly!  I definitely recommend the Artisan/Filet combo to anyone.  They cook their seasonal fish perfectly as well.  I have not dined inside the historic bungalows - however they do look very cozy!  Note: There is only a single bathroom for the property, now that's really keeping it historic lol.   Adding some white \"holiday\" lights to the patio trees for the evening crowd would be a great addition.   Jabbing aside this is a good place to have dinner.",

It is expensive, yes, but worth coming to for special occasions. I wouldn't eat here regularly, so if you're looking for something like that, this probably isn't the place.  All that being said, the service was quite bad, and if you're gonna charge that much for dinner, it seems like you should provide good service. This was my first time here, so maybe it was just a fluke, but both the bartenders and our waiter were really inattentive. We stood at the bar for quite awhile waiting for someone to even glance in our direction, and there were several people working. Then our waiter was nice enough when we were seated and he took our orders, but then he completely disappeared. He never once refilled our waters or asked if we wanted more drinks. We finally got a busser to refill our waters after everyone had finished eating, and only then did our waiter reappear to give us the check. By that point no one wanted dessert or coffee, which probably would've been delicious, but we didn't feel encouraged to stay. I would come back, so hopefully the service is better next time.",

My friend and I arrived at 6 o'clock and free parking wasn't hard to find and were able to get one of their outdoor tables without reservation. After consulting with our waittress (who literally guaranteed that everything on the menu was really good, particularly for the carrot cheese cake)...we ordered:  appetizers: pork belly and scallops main dishes: rag pasta + veal (weird looking pasta but veal meant was very tender) and pork belly dessert: carrot cheesecake and salted caramel bread pudding wine + soda Total for these dishes above came to $106 without tax.  The notable dishes were scallops (looked and tasted curry like but with relatively small portions, it wasn't too much or too little to have!)...and salted caramel bread pudding (my friend and I have been having bread pudding from different restaurants in the past 3 days, and we agreed this one tasted among the best). Rag pasta also had very interesting texture (probably due to its interesting shape) when chewed in my mouth (in a good way). However, I was sort of disappointed that the carrot cheesecake was WAYYYYYYYY too sweet...even without the frosting....  One of the things we had with this restaurant was more on plating issues. The way this restaurant plates their dishes seem a bit random. The dessert plate (that came with our cheesecake was too long (the plate was the long one that should have been used for 3 items plating rather than 1 cheesecake) also, the plates they brought for us to share looked completely all 3 different occasions times waitresses bring them. They definitely need to work on details such as plating consistency and appropriateness (wow...don't I sound like a food snob now?!!?)... :)",

We came to eat with a party of 6, and I was really impressed with the atmosphere and wait staff. Being a non-AZ visitor, obviously I was in love with sitting outside by the firepit in December. The waiters always made sure we had full water glasses and drinks, but they were careful not to be in the way or too obtrusive - clearly well trained. Everyone was super happy with their waiter-guided wine choices and cocktails.  I ordered the scallops appetizer, and the salmon entree. My husband had the mussels appetizer and the lamb entree (I assume this rotates regularly). Everything was absolutely *to die* for. I will say that the mussels were enough to be an entree in themselves! The scallops were some of the best cooked I've ever had.  definitely a little pricey, but worth it for a date night (or when you're parents visit!)",

    "text": "My husband and I love to try new restaurants, and this one had great reviews and piqued my interest.  Started out by using the SeatMe option on Yelp.   That worked great, our table was ready and waiting for us, AND I had mentioned it was our anniversary on the reservation, so our very capable server brought us complimentary sparkling wine for us to toast each other with.  We started with the wild boar appetizer for my husband and scallops for me.   Both delicious and plated beautifully.  My scallops were perfectly seared and the boar was very tasty.   We had been provided with a bread basket beforehand, which was FULL of bread.   Others have reviewed the bread negatively, but we thought It was tasty, as was the butter.   That being said, I would prefer the bread be warm rather than cold which would also make the butter easier to spread.  We both ordered wine, mine was white and was one of the local AZ choices, Provisioner, I believe, and it was crisp and lovely.  My husband asked for a suggestion from the server for a red, I can't remember which one he went with, but he was very happy with the suggestion.   Next came our entrees.  My husband ordered lamb, which he loved.  He said it melted in his mouth.  I had  the 14 ounce pork chop which came with red potatoes and an apple mustard something or other glaze that was out of this world.   So HUGE, though, I had a  box prepared to go.     Now on to dessert, since it was our anniversary of COURSE we had to get one to share.  We went with the apple bread pudding with caramel sauce and cinnamon whip cream which was HUGE and wonderfully creamy and delicious.   It was an amazing dessert and an anniversary to remember.  Would definitely go back!",

We ordered the smoked wild boar to share, very nicely plated, unfortunately the flour tortillas were sticking to each other and soggy with the juices from the meat. I ordered the pork Osso Buco and the meat was good but expected it to be exceptional for the price and place, in addition the shaved gruyere was missing and the snap peas were very tough and stringy. My wife ordered the fish of the day, opah, with potato gratin, was very good but portion was tiny. Finally we finished with the apple and bread pudding, was tasty but dry, lacking the moist creamy texture. Overall this place is overpriced for its not so exceptional quality and taste.",

Anyway, I met my dad here for lunch yesterday at around 11:30 and the place had some customers, but wasn't crazy busy. We sat outside, and that was very nice. We decided to split the caesar salad with chicken and the chicken sandwich with the goat cheese and fig jam. The caesar was really good, the dressing tasted excellent and was tossed perfectly, and the chicken was also very flavorful, but the whole thing still had a light quality to it. It was tasty. The sandwich was also very good. I could taste each ingredient, which I like, the bread was good, crispy but soft at the same time, and the combo of flavors was really great. Also, the service was excellent, my water was never empty.   So I would most definitely come back here. I just think I need to try dinner here and some more complex dishes than what I got before I can give it five stars, but honestly, as far as sandwich places go, I liked this very much, better than pane bianco.",

Reservation at 8, arrived early and were seated by 8:10 (restaurant was full and bussers were behind, but hustling). We ordered a salad to split as an appetizer and it arrived promptly,  but our server dissappeared for quite a while. The salad plates had been cleared away before she returned to get our entree order. Then, we waited. And waited. And waited. My son's root beer was forgotten, along with my beer, both required follow-up with the server. After 40 minutes i asked if there was any sign of our food...server went in search. Another 5-10 minutes before we were served by our apologetic (she was consistently sweet) server. It was good, but, as my wife said, not \"to die for.\" I haf the duck, my wife had the mahi mahi, and our 13 year old tried the cornish game hen. He was asking to stop for a burger on the way home. The manager came over after we ate and apologized, even adjusted our bill to make it up to us. We still had room for dessert, which were all very tasty - flourless torte, lavender cheesecake, and scoops of gelato. Luckily we didn't get towed...as we returned to the pay lot well after our 2 hours had expired.",

We went there for restaurant week menu and the menu that was on the table was the wrong one.  Not a big deal just not something I expect.  Now, my pet peeve is when a restaurant that has such a nice menu and atmosphere serves me bread with cold hard butter.  How are you supposed to spread cold hard butter on your bread.  The server said they keep it in the cooler because if they didn't they couldn't scoop it to serve it. This tells me one thing.  They use crappy butter.  Good butter can be stored and should be served at room temp.  No real fine dining establishments will serve you hard butter that is not spreadable.  Other than that irritating me, the pork belly, flat iron, and carrot cake were great.",

The hostess sat us in a quite room (which was really nice)., gave us the menus and wine list.  Our waiter came, he introduced himself, ... didn't ask if this was our first time at House of Tricks, have any questions about the menu, just  asked for our drink order and left. When he brought our drinks asked if we were ready to order, when we hesitated he said \"I'll give you more time and LEFT'. A basket of cold bread was brought to us. Waiter returns and we ask him some questions about the menu, ordered soup and salad. Soup was lukewarm when it came, Salad was good. Waiter doesn't show up till we are done with this portion. He takes my salad plate, reaches across me takes the spoon that I had placed to my left and realigns the spoon on the left side of the table, takes the other fork and plops it into the plate (like I really committed a faux pas), let him know soup was only luke warm \"Hmm.. sorry about that). We had several questions about items on the menu.  I don't like spicy/hot food. Those questions were answered with \"You don't have to have that but no substitutions were forthcoming.\" Finally settled on the filet. Which was very good, the potatoes and spinach was just  ok.. nothing special. But the food was lukewarm when it was brought to us. After our meal he asked if there was anything else. We asked to see the dessert menu, I didn't have one in my little burgandy book... but they didn't sound appealing at all. THen as we were leaving I spotted a dessert tray, that actually had some good looking stuff on it. Over all I would not  recommend House of Tricks to anyone. It was mediocre at best. This will go down in the anniversary dining book as should have gone elsewhere.",

So many places are \"pay for where your sitting\" as opposed to for \"what your getting\". It might not be cheap here, but you'll be satisfied every step of the way. Can't give them enough praise at this place.",

    "text": "I was always interested in trying this restaurant because my husband had raved about it in the past but my experience was barely memorable.  I think the atmosphere is fantastic.  Great place to be outside for either lunch or dinner, however, the food was average and the service was terrible.  We were a party of 5 dining at lunch.  We were sat promptly but took at least 10 minutes for a server to greet us and take our drink order.  We ordered the Mediterranean Tapas Platter and that was really good and I'm not usually a big fan.  The presentation was great and the flavor combinations were also very good.  For my entree I ordered Toasted Green Chile Corn Bread BLT because it sounded amazing.  All the robust flavors and ingredients that were listed on the menu sounded like it would have been out of this world. Chili-Rubbed Bacon, Melted Havarti, Roasted Green Chiles,Bibb Lettuce Tomato and Mayo between a green chile corn bread bun. The bun was a little overwhelming, too rich and overtook the other flavors.  I felt it was lacking on the green chiles because they were few and far between.  I started to pick through my sandwich because it was too much and my lettuce wasn't fresh and there was very little on there.  I don't tend to complain on my reviews but I was disappointed.  Our server got my order incorrect and brought me the chive bacon potato salad and I wasn't impressed by that either.  I didn't bring it to her attention that I had ordered the pasta salad as a substitute because my daughter got that and it was saturated in dressing. The other people in our party seemed to enjoy their food so maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.  Overall, I think it is a unique restaurant with great potential and I will definitely try again for that reason.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were visiting Phoenix/Scottsdale for the weekend and I'd read some reviews about House of Tricks so we decided to give it a try! BOY are we ever glad we did! First of all, when you walk up to House of Tricks you just cant get over how cute it is! The courtyard with the twinkling lights, the outdoor bar area, etc. We arrived early to have a drink at the bar and I had the usual glass of wine and my boyfriend tried one of their newer drinks on the menu the Blackberry Gin Lemonade. It was quite tasty, they added Ginger Ale to it, but it was a tad flat, other than that it was a great bar drink.   We then were seated outside in a quaint little area to ourselves. The only complaint I may have about sitting outside is that it there wasn't much lighting so it was kinda hard to read the menu and see the food. BUT, the FOOD, oh the FOOD it was sooo delicious. We ordered two appetizers the Mussels, which were absolutely to die for. The sauce they were in, the bread for the dipping, the chorizo...oh my! We were in love. We also ordered the Shrimp and Salmon cakes and those were quite tasty as well, but seemed to be over shadowed by the delicious mussels.   We were pretty full by that point so we decided to split an entree and we ordered the Ling Cod. The waitress was actually excellent and split up the entree for us, so we each received our own plate. Once again we were blown away by the flavor profile. The fish was cook to perfection and the reduction with the fingerling potatoes were sooo delicious. We were ABSOLUTELY stuffed by the end of the meal.  My only complaint I may have about the restaurant is that when we booked the reservation we mentioned that it was a birthday celebration for my boyfriend. Besides the hostess wishing him a happy birthday, nothing else was done for it, so I was a little disappointed and I think he was too in that regard. Other than that, if I lived in the Phoenix/Scottsdale/Tempe area I would be going there every weekend! I was surprised to see how dead it was on a Friday night though? Maybe because ASU is out for the summer? I'm not sure, but all in all I would recommend anyone visiting or wanting a really great meal to try House of Tricks. We talked about it for the rest of the weekend!",

    "text": "Was very disappointed with our last visit. We had planned ahead to visit House of Tricks before going to a play. Called ahead to find out how early we should arrive so that we could enjoy ourselves. When we arrived it was not very busy and definitely was nowhere as full as we have seen on other visits. The waiter was pleasant enough but not very attentive. We were with friends and did not want to be pushy or bossy but it took an hour and a half for us to receive our dinner. We really did not even have the opportunity to find out what was going on with our food because the waiter was nowhere in sight. When we received our dinner we asked for our check, shoved our food in our mouths and ran for the play. As we were leaving the waiter said \"you should have told us you were in a rush\". Honestly I thought that by planning ahead making a reservation allowing the amount of time that the restaurant recommend was enough. I did not think that I had to tell the waiter my plans for the evening in order to get our food in a timely manner. Everyone did comment that it was Restaurant Week but the restaurant was not full and it was early enough in the evening that they should have been able to ensure that we had time to enjoy our food or even check back with us to tell us why our food was taking so long. We were in great company so in no way was it a bad evening. We are just very disappointed that the Restaurant did not take care of us the way they should have. Nor did they even care to return our call to discuss what had occurred. It just goes to show that you do not always get what you pay for $$$$ and especially not at the House of Ticks.",

And it was late May so we could have used them.   Finally, our waiter comes over with a light appetizer plate and apologizes that our order wasn't placed properly. Some lame excuse and then... he said he paid for the appetizer out of his own pocket since he didn't want the manager to ream him.   By the time we got our food, it was an hour-and-a-half from when we walked in. Not good in my book. Needless to say, I haven't been back. At least my clients had a good sense of humor and said I pulled a good Trick on them.",

    "text": "When I dine, I like a fine balance of elegance and comfort. House of Tricks is just that--an institution where you can consume a delicious array of food while dining in a charming 1920's bungalow with attentive but not-at-all overbearing service. As one of the only True fine dining experiences in Tempe, Tricks sets itself apart with unique dishes that challenge the status quo, expectedly a result of the lack of competition in its field. I ordered the Frenched Chicken with Israeli Cous Cous (the food so nice they had to name it twice) and purple cauliflower. Its mixture and arrangement of textures bounced playfully onto my fork and tastebuds, ensuring my palette that this place was the real deal; not to forget that their cheese plate was a brilliant addition as a starter. The rest of my party ate lamb and filet mignon, all of which were received in a positive light. The service at Tricks is worth noting--for some, it might seem inattentive and casual for the price you pay to dine. For me, I prefer the laid back environment that extends humbleness to a restaurant with such amazing offerings. Even if the service didn't have the pretentious air that some guests prefer, our server had great recommendations and a nice spontaneity that made the restaurant seem like a private retreat of good eats surrounded by friends. If I had one complaint, I felt that the dinner was priced a bit higher than necessary when compared to other restaurants of a similar caliber in the Phoenix metropolitan area; however, one cannot deny the atmosphere of Tricks with its quaint interior and beautiful patio seating areas which could be incorporated into the price of a dish for the most discriminating clientele. If I'm ever taking someone to an important dinner in the Tempe area, we're going to House of Tricks.",

They were so accommodating -  ordering a special cake, bringing out umbrellas when the sun came through the trees a bit too strong for some of the guests, and helping to keep the party flowing.  Our guests are still raving!  We chose to sit outside on a private patio on such a beautiful AZ winter day (70 degrees) which I would highly recommend...the greenery, fountains and ambiance made for a perfect party location. I would highly recommend this venue for your event!!",

    "text": "I was waiting in the check out line at Basha's and the latest edition of Phoenix Magazine caught my eye with the headline \"21 Best Sandwiches\". Being a huge sandwich lover, I flipped to the article immediately and found that House of Tricks was written up as the best maker of a Reuben (one of my personal favorites). The decision was made then and there that a lunch at this restaurant was necessary.   When I heard that it was near ASU and called House of Tricks, I assumed this was some casual sandwich shop or divey type of bar; I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was elegant and almost soothing to have a meal there. We sat down for a late Saturday lunch in the courtyard which was surrounded by trees, flowers, brick patio, and a fountain. The menu had something for everyone, but my mind was made up before I walked into the restaurant.   When my Reuben was placed in front of me I did not waste one moment and quickly began eating. I figured the review was going to be hyped up too much, but I was relieved to find it extremely delicious. Every component of the sandwich was yummy: bread, cheese, sauerkraut, dressing and best of all the corned beef. The potato salad they gave as a side was also great, not too creamy with a good punch of garlic.   I also tried some of the ham sandwich but I was underwhelmed. After eating half of the Reuben I had high hopes, and the ham sandwich did not live up to my expectations. However, it is close to being fantastic. I personally think it was too sweet, not enough mustard, and too much brie.   I would highly suggest this place for a nice lunch or dinner. This would be a great spot for a date, dinner with your parents, or just getting together with a few friends.",

There are many reasons to love House of Tricks, these are just a few.  Others include excellent service, a prime location in the heart of Tempe, and a beautiful outdoor bar.  The restaurant is truly unique, and a welcome break from the typical tan, stucco box restaurants around Phoenix.  I've been eating here for years and keep coming back to sample new things on the menu.  My latest visit introduced me to the short ribs and they were rich, moist, just perfect.  For starters, we tried the cheese platter, the mussels, and the wild boar... all were excellent.  Dessert was also good, a salted caramel gelato.  Expect to pay up for all this greatness, but it is worth it.  It's a great spot for a romantic date night, or a quiet business dinner in a unique setting.  I'll be back, soon!",

The last four times we have tried to go they were completely booked for private events.  As a result I don't try and take people here anymore as we always have to scramble to pick some other place.

    "text": "The Chicken Ballontine is the absolute best chicken meal I have ever had in my entire life.  About a year ago, I first visited Tricks. I was debating between the Chicken Ballontine and the Airplane Chicken. I asked the waiter who replied, \"the Airplane Chicken is a nice meal; it's like a very upscale Thanksgiving dinner and quite delicious.\"   Me: \"And what about the Chicken Ballontine?\"  Waiter: \"Um, well, about that. Some people have said it's the best chicken they have ever eaten in their entire lives.\"  Me: \"I'll take it.\"  The Chicken Ballontine is a simply amazing chicken dish. It comes as chicken stuffed with foie gras and brioche stuffing, coated in a cognac demi glaze, with a light layer of seared caul fat surrounding the chicken to give it a crisp, served over greens (kale, I think) over butternut squash.  The dish is absolutely incredible as the flavors blend together. Everything is in perfect balance in this meal and you will find yourself cursing the gods that chicken has been ruined for you in all other forms. Even at $26, it's that good.  I know \"best chicken you've ever had\" sounded hyperbolic and I thought it was strange for someone to speak *so* highly about a dish. Usually, a waiter will taper their response to make sure they don't look a fool if you dislike it.  This was of no concern to him for good reason.  The chicken was incredible. And then, three weeks later, they switched to their Spring menu, and it was gone.   Distraught, I emailed them asking if it may come back. They mentioned that it was a possibility, but that chef Kelly Fletcher had been forwarded the email.  He responded saying that while he never brings a dish back in rotation, he would make an exception because of the response he had received to it.  When we visited last night, I made a point of mentioning that I had petitioned for the dish's return. The waitress (who was wonderful in all regards) sent chef Kelly Fletcher out to greet us personally. He came out with a grin and asked how we liked it. I explained that I would likely be doing serious damage to my heart several times over for the next few weeks as he had gotten it just right again.  The dish is very complex--he explained that the demi glace is of course homemade and requires ten+ veal bones, the caul fat is a process in its own right, and getting your hands on enough foie gras to use it in a dish like this can be a challenge, but it's absolutely worth it.   It really is the best chicken I have ever had.  (And the goat cheese-cinammon-apple-chutney-with-lime-basil-syrup tart was amazing too, and the perfect end to our evening last night.)",

I'm curious please tell me??!?! Soooo this should really be 4.5 stars as everyone has said the service was a bit slow. A lot of places down here in Tempe seem that way to me. For some weird reason or another I feel like I enter the Twilight Zone and the waiters dont seem to have a need for time. Maybe they teach this course at ASU or maybe everyones just stoned, IDK!?!?!   The soup of the day was some carrot ginger thing with creme it did not taste like carrots at all whatsoever but it was super delicous and I dont even like ginger haha!! Sarah took a pic of the salad I had. I had the best salad EVER!!! Moroccan Fruit and Chicken Shawarma Salad with Mango, Melon, Strawberries, Oranges, Toasted Pine Nuts, Citrus Cous Cous and Baby Field Greens with Preserved Lemon Vinaigrette. I substituted the chicken for some Tombo Ahi it was a few dollars more but OH SOOO WORTH IT!! Abso-fucking-lutely YUM-GASMIC!! The chef here is a fucking genius and I will never have enough of this place.....EVER! Where is Gordon Ramsey when you need him to light a fire under your server's ass to get the tables turned around quicker??   I will surely bring all out of towner's here for dinner and do more special occasions here in the future. Wine tasting is on Tuesdays I better move closer!! So when are we going?!?!?",

    "text": "I never think of this place as a last-minute lunch time location but recently when a friend came in from out-of-town, I suggested we dine at House of Tricks. Despite the January afternoon, we sat on their beautiful patio next to the fountain. We were easily accommodated without a reservation during the lunch hour. We enjoyed a lengthy two-hour lunch with an appetizer, entree, and dessert. Needless to say, this review will throw more icing on their cake but the experience was magnificent. From the friendly, nice-looking wait staff and hostess to the interesting food combinations, House of Tricks gives you an intimate dining experience in the heart of Tempe.   I do wish parking was easier and that the college students with mobile phones growing out of their ears passed by less often. Oh well, it does not matter! I just turned my chair toward the picturesque little house, watched the koi swim passively in the fountain, while feeling the cool breeze through the trees, as though I was casually dining in the French countryside.",

I found the entrees to be more expensive than their worth: I ordered the beef tenderloin with spinach and horseradish mashed potatoes, and it was good but it was nothing to merit its $29 price tag. We also ordered apps to share, including a cheese plate, which was just.. cheese. With not enough crackers for the amount of cheese. I got the sticky toffee bread pudding for dessert and it was delicious. I'd highly recommend it. But the night I went, they were out of a lot of things, and this was Friday at 9pm. Their espresso machine was broken, so no coffees. They ran out of ice cream. They ran out of their nightly special.   I've had amazing meals in places that charge similar prices. But those were amazing meals with great service and none of the problems we ran into here. Let's just say HOT is on the right track, but needs to get it together before they can justify charging so much.",

    "text": "How funny that in 2007 I wrote a Yelp review about Tricks saying it was a \"perfect date place\". I went back yesterday for a date and, again, nothing short of \"perfect\" would describe the House's performance. It was an oddly windy and blustery night last night, so the entire outdoor patio had been abandoned by the other customers who'd fled to the tables inside. The host asked us if we wanted to brave it outside and we decided to give it a shot. Since we had our pick of tables, we opted for one directly adjacent to the open-pit fire they maintain in the center of the patio. The wind was a little crazy sometimes. It was a bit cold. An occasional leaf fell into our wine glasses. But the fire kept us warm, the glow from the flames created a fairy tale-like ambiance, and the addition of leaves and twigs to our meal gave us something to laugh about.   Add to all that a team of professional, down to earth yet very knowledgeable (ask for an opinion about the wine list) staff, plus delicious food (we shared an apricot-glazed chicken breast and tagliatelle pasta with toasted fennel goat cheese), and I honestly cannot conceive of any missing ingredients that would keep the night from being perfect.",

    "text": "How do I love thee House of Tricks?  Let me count the ways:  1.  The cozy cottage and gorgeous bar area complete with twinkle lights make me forget I am right off of Mill Ave which is a definite plus.  2.  There are plenty of delicious options at lunch and dinner for my non-meat eating friends.  3.  One of the most underrated wine lists in the Valley at a far lower markup than other restaurants of its caliber in the area.  Example, several years ago before Turley blew up and became a trendy wine, I used to enjoy bottles there for $45!!!  Crazy, I know...  4.  Their food is fresh and divine.  Their dinner menu changes seasonally and their creative chef always offers very inventive specials that you wish would be put permanently on the menu.  Some of my favorites are the Ahi tuna and the oh so tender Petite Filet Mignon.  5.  They recently added a Happy Hour!!!!  (Multiple exclamation points because we all know I like the sauce : )  )  6.  House of Tricks became the first restaurant in all of Arizona that my food snob of a mother insists I take her to every time she comes in town to visit.  I have to take one star away (well, really only a half a star if I had my way) because their lunch prices are a bit steep and it upsets me that my wallet prohibits me from eating there as often as I'd like.  If you've never been there, run don't walk.  It is truly a gem in one of the dullest dining parts of the Valley.",

It's not somewhere I'd go on any given night, seeing as how the bill is about $100 for a dinner for two.   I appreciated the menu having a good deal of seafood on it, as I don't eat any red meat. We had the scallops as an app. - while the serving was small (as expected), the scallops were the prettiest ones I have ever seen! For dinner I had the ahi tuna - it was WAY bigger than I expected, I couldn't even finish it - but my date didn't hesitate to finish it for me.   We sat outside as the sun was setting. The atmosphere was pretty much perfect except for one thing. We were seating next to the concrete wall separating the restaurant from the street. If you're sitting at the tables next to the wall, I'd say it comes up to your elbows. Anyway, there were ants crawling all over the wall and it made me kind of uncomfortable and itchy.   Our server was a young guy who could have washed his shirt a few times before wearing it again. Otherwise, he was pretty cool - sort of a 'no sense of urgency' kind of server - but we weren't in too much of a hurry anyway.",

The food is wonderful and the menu changes frequently. The Ahi and the Asian Pear Salad are amazing, their quiches are delicious and every meat selection I have tried there has been well aged an cooked to perfection. They have a new happy hour menu consiting of Homemade Artisan Grilled Cheese with Roasted Garlic Tomato Basil Soup, Flatbread Pizza with Homemade Mozzarella, Fresh Tomato Pomodoro and Basil, Herb Crusted Mac & Cheese with Southern Fried Drumettes and Smoked Chili Honey, Antipasto of Cerignola Olives, Cured Meats and Artisan Cheeses and Thai Barbecue Grilled Quail Skewers.

And what would I order? Their daily quiche. Absolutely. No hesitations. No second thoughts.   Their quiche of the day is perfection!  I've eaten here twice in a single week. Yes, House of Tricks is simply that awesome. After my 1st visit, I was craving it the very next day. So I made plans to go back that very week. I wanted to try their quiche again.   House of Tricks is my absolute favorite lunch spot in Tempe!  For $10, you get their quiche of the day, fresh fruit and a soup or salad.   First quiche was chicken and goat cheese. Wow... That's all I could think to myself. \"Wow, Alicia, this is... wow...\"   Second trip I had sausage, mushrooms and Gruyere quiche, which I ordered with their daily soup, a lobster squash concoction. While the soup was really, really good, I was still enamored with their quiche.   And fresh fruit? C'mon. This is the stuff Lunch Nirvana is made of!  House of Tricks, thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you!   House of Tricks, I love you! I love your quiche! You deserve every single exclamation point in the exclamation point satchel. Seriously!  I would eat inside, outside, at the bar, wherever I could. Yes, I'd eat here every single day. That adds up to a $50 weekly habit... but I bet there's not one quiche I wouldn't like!",

I do not eat pork so I substituted the lemon honey vinaigrette instead of the usual pancetta dressing and it was still delicious.   Entree: I ate the squid ink pasta appetizer as my entree. It comes with three large prawns, calamari, and a jalapeno corn broth. It is large enough for an entree.  Dessert: we tried the blueberry whoopie  pie - somewhat of a letdown - the outer cake was dry and the lemon curd filling tasted more like an icing - not enough tartness. We also tried the flourless chocolate cake with earl gray whipped cream and raspberries which was good but nothing special.   The service was good, although we had to move tables from inside to outside due to the noise level inside the restaurant.   The dinner was moderately priced, but the cute outdoor atmosphere and quality of the salad and entree made it work! Other than the noisy people inside and the desserts which left something to be desired, I had a nice time! Would return.",

The atmosphere is very romantic and intimate.  The problem I have with this place is the unconsistency of the food.  The first time I ever came here I had an amazing experience, I still tell people how awesome the duck was.  So imagine my surprise when our food this last visit was very sub par.  My boyfriend took me here for my bday dinner and the only really memorable part of the experience was the AMAZING wine choice our very knowledgable waiter suggested.  My boyfriend ordered the short ribs; I'm not sure if it was just a bad cut but it was over 50% fat.  I ordered the bacon wrapped tuna; it didnt seem that the tuna was marinated or seasoned at all, and overall the plate was simply uninteresting.   The atmosphere and service here is great, but our last dining experience will probably keep us from ever returning.  For the quality of food we recieved, we were robbed.  It's never a good experience paying $200 for a dinner and feeling completly unsatisfied.  Sorry Tricks.",

We started with the wagyu bone marrow app, which was rich and fabulous flavor with mushrooms. I had the fresh fish (Cod for the evening) which was a larger than expected portion and cooked perfectly. My husband had the short ribs and the sauce was wonderful. They have an extensive wine list and the server was very knowledgeable when I asked her questions for recommendations. We had another drink at the cozy bar at the end of the night. The cocktails were well mixed and I even had a bourbon martini that I loved, even though I don't really drink bourbon. :-)   I have literally been wanting to come here for the last couple years since I heard great things about House of Tricks and they did not disappoint! I cannot wait to go back and thank you for making my day!!",

Unfortunately, tonight, we sat down to dinner and almost immediately, the bus boy spilled ice water down the whole back of my mother's shirt. They tried to make it right by buying her dessert, but in my opinion this is not enough for a woman who spends over 200 dollars on a meal and had to sit in her ice water soaked shirt throughout the entire meal... Not nearly as happy today as I've been in the past...",

I guess a better idea would be to meet here for dinner after the construction people finish for the day.  Does Tempe really need more apartments?  This looks like a HUGE project.",

    "text": "Wow, I had to write a review because of the scathing one star review I saw.  Sounds like that poor man really hit House of Tricks on a bad night.  His has not been my experience, so I felt compelled to share.  I will also state that observing the dates of the reviews, it does seem that perhaps House of Tricks is experiencing some inconsistent service issues.  I certainly hope that they hit this page, and fix their inconsistencies, because it has been a great place.  I am from Ohio and have had the pleasure to eat at HoTs twice.  The first was in 2005.  I was taken there by a bank during a business trip.  We were a group of eight.  We ate at a large round table outside, which in my opinion is the only place to eat.  Honestly, I have never been inside HoTs.  They have a full bar outside, high-top tables and bar seating which is  open (non-reserved) seating.  There are misters that cool the Tempe air to a comfortable temperature.  As a couple of other reviewers mentioned it is an intimate and romantic atmosphere.  The dress is very casual, you could go with shorts and t-shirts, but most wear business professional clothing which would be more appropriate for the atmosphere.  My experience in 2005 was excellent.  The service was attentive, the food was AMAZING!  All eight of us thoroughly enjoyed our dishes.  Their wine selection is very good, and the bar drinks are very generous and their liquor selection is great.  So last October 2010 my dad and I had flown to Salt Lake City on business and were stranded by the airline in PHX.  I was SO EXCITED!!  My father LOVES restaurants like HoTs, so I was set on taking him there.  I called to see if they had a table for two and found out they were booked.  The hostess told me that they had three high top tables at the outdoor bar that were first come first served, they were open, and if we didn't wait too long one of them could be ours.  My dad was kind of tired, and really just wanted to stay at the hotel, but I wasn't taking no for an answer.  We hailed a cab and off we went.  I was so hoping that it had not changed and the food would be as good as it was five years before and I was not disappointed.  Better yet, my dad LOVED it!  It was just as I remembered.  Great menu selections, creative and inventive dishes which were well executed.  Wonderful mixed drinks, great wine selection.  I don't usually eat dessert, but we both ordered desserts which were wonderful and perfectly sized.  The staff was wonderful, the hostess kept stopping by our table just randomly to ask if we were having a good time, and checking to see if we needed anything.  I believe she was the one I spoke to on the phone, and she also greeted us when we arrived.  I explained to her that I had been there five years before and was so excited to be able to bring my dad.  She really went out of her way to make us feel welcome.  I have told many friends about HoTs, and I really hope to get back there someday soon.",

We were too full for dessert so I have no idea the quality of them. This review would be 5 star were it not for our table and the wait staff. I do not like my order taken by one person and delivered by several others. Our waitress checked back once but I really didn't feel taken care of. Our table was abysmal, the view was BOTH into the kitchen and both bathrooms. I had made reservations for a special birthay celebration well over a week in advance, they could have done better.",

    "text": "This was our first visit. We came at the recommendation of a friend as part of a group of five. The menu is very interesting. Some items seem high priced but others don't. I had the heirloom spinach salad and it was good. My concern is that I think it was over complicated but it was different. I had the appetizer mussels as a main course. I couldn't have eaten more so it is just as well. The others also tried combinations of soup, salads and/or appetizer and seemed happy. None of us tried an entree which we can try another time. Nobody had room for dessert. The wine list was decent though the three of us who were drinking all ended up with a decent, fairly priced petite sirah. Eventually we were talked into buying a bottle though there is no price advantage. The staff was all very nice and the waitress helpful except when things got busy and we didn't hear from her at a time we needed her. No doubt we will be back. One word of warning: the parking lot across the street has a 24 hour ticket kiosk which everyone seemed to find confusing. If there is no street parking, spot the self serve machine, park nearby, remember your space number and have correct change or a credit card.",

Main dishes (fillet and pork porterhouse) were cooked just right and beautifully presented. And I can't remember the last desert I enjoyed so completely as their bread puddling (think: cross between the best apple cobbler and the best cinnamon rolls you've ever had, all topped with a melting scoop of vanilla bean ice cream). The ambiance was very nice as well. (Great spot for a romantic evening out, especially dinning outside on a perfectly warm evening in the springtime.) If I had to point out anything less than stellar it would probably be that it's located slightly too close to an airport, so there were one or two incoming planes that were a little noisy -- but not all that bad, really. Overall, downright exceptional place for dinner! Definitely coming back whenever possible.",

The salmon was tasty, there online menu says they smoke it in house, but the menu that day didn't say such, but it didn't seem like any store bought stuff I have ever had, really thick and some what juicy, guess I should have just asked, and we could have both have just skipped all that.   On another note service wasn't that great, but they were in the middle of shift change so take that as you want.   On a better note the pecan smoked BBQ sandwich was kick-ass, I actually made some BBQ sauce the next day and steeped some pecans in it just see how it would come out since I liked the flavor so much. The potato salad was good besides being a little under seasoned, but to each there own, because you can just add salt to your liking, but I had none on my table and had to go and find some, see previous note.   They have a good beer selection too.   So five stars for the food and 3 for the service.   P.S. my BBQ sauce turned out kick-ass too.",

Black Ink pasta appetizer with seafood has seriously over-cooked ribbon pasta and undercooked tiger shrimp. My salmon entree was a delicious, high quality, well-seasoned, generous sized piece of salmon, over seriously overgrilled (hard) cubed potatoes and blanched brussels sprouts that reminded me of what my mother cooked 40 years ago when everyone hated brussels sprouts - no creativity whatsoever. My wife's tuna was also a great piece of fish, but overly complex preparation with failed accompaniments.

    "text": "House of Tricks were have you been?  For 4 years I have been meaning to come here.  I was looking for a place to take the rents while in town and was happy to have HOT show up on yelp.  Amazing, and home run idea.  I am really into the house turn restaurant.  It gives it a cozy slip into the chair by the fire and start knocking back the wine.  Strong menu, and offer something for everyone - I was really impressed that they offer Foie Gras, Sweetbreads to Scallops and Crab Cakes.  I really almost felt overwhelmed with what to get.  Lucky for me I was with a party of 6 and we share :)  I managed to walk away trying quite a bit.  I am not a 100% but I think the menu changes with the season, which makes me want to go back even more, just to see what they come up with next.  Okay down to business I some how made out with trying:  Apps Veal Two Ways: Seared Sweetbreads on Celery Root Puree with Watercress and Braised Veal Bacon with Yellow Curry Cream, Butternut Squash and Red Apple Chutney  Seared Scallops with Mascapone Polenta, Oyster Mushroom Beurre Blanc, Smoked Tomato Vinaigrette and Black Tobiko  Pork Belly on Peanut Rice and Pea Puree  DInner Chili Rubbed Ahi Tuna, Seared RARE, with Mole Amarillo, Red Chili Onion Rings, Yukon Gold Potatoes and Sauteed Oyster Mushrooms  Seared Coffee Cardamom Crusted Duck Breast with Bacon Caramel Apples, Yam Puree, Baby Bok Choy and Pomegranate Gastrique  Braised Tender Belly Pork Osso Bucco with Winter Squash-Mushroom Risotto, Apricot-Cherry Mostarda and Citrus Sage Gremolata  After 4 glasses of Cab I could have done it all over again.  The only thing that surprises me about Tricks is that they do not offer a tasting menu.  With all the wonderful choice a 3, 5 or 7 course tasting would be a great compliment.  I think the menu was surprisingly large and it was actually very difficult to make a choice.  At least with a tasting you are getting what the Chef thinks are the best and a great way to try a restaurant.  Who knows may they will add  I will be back for sure, the ambiance is just a wonderful intimate feeling.  The outdoor sitting area is the best in the valley and they maximize the space heaters and fire pits, that you don't have to worry about sitting outside unless it rains.",

The manager never apologized nor tried to see what he could do to correct the situation.  When we left he was standing by the bar just talking and laughing with a patron..

I ate lunch here and I was impressed with how one of the managers was educating the staff about the wine specials for the day and he had an impressive knowledge of many things that just aren't generally imparted to wait staff at most places (he went off into detail about microbes in the soil of South Africa giving wine certain flavors etc).   I enjoyed the flank steak I got for lunch except it was a very small portion and flank steak just isn't the best cut of meat to do very much with.  I inspected the dinner menu and it looked to have some very promising items on it that would certainly be worth checking out but the prices increased substantially for the dinner entrees.  I certainly think this would be a great place just to enjoy some great wine with friends.",

My friends ordered the ribs and it was also delicious.  I was fortunate enough to get a bite.  The service was ok.  The ambiance was decent.  We had a few visitors from cats during our visit.  Seeing as though I am a cat person, I loved it.    I would highly recommend eating here.  The price per person is around $40.  Well worth a try!  It was a nice surprise hidden in Tempe.",

First of all, the atmosphere and ambiance was very nice. The outdoors seating looked very nice and romantic under the stars, but we chose to sit inside, which was as very exquisite. What made it for me, though, was the food. I'm not a fine dining girl, so maybe I'm just a noob, but I thought the food was the epitome of what food could taste like if cooked well. I don't remember the fancy menu names, but I ordered pork and my boyfriend ordered duck. We ended up switching because he liked the pork more and I like the duck more. But in the end, the symphony of flavors melted together in my mouth - I ate every bit off of my plate and savored every bite. I wish I could afford to go back more often. Next time!",

The aromas from other's food while sitting around at bar let me know I was in for a good meal.   I had trouble deciding what to eat, so I ordered 3 appetizers:   Seafood Stuffed Poblano Pepper, Veal 2 ways, and Braized Oxtail.    The bartender did a fantastic job of recommending the order in which i received my food - lightest to heaviest.  The \"Veal 2 Ways\" and \"Braised Oxtail\" were phenomenal.... a great combination of flavors and texture.   I think I'd put them both in my list of Top 10 dishes.     I can't wait to travel back to Phoenix to eat there again.    I'll also add the I really like the atmosphere.   Very chill place, but elegant without being stuffy.",

Great drink list with specialty beers and wine available. The atmosphere is a world unto itself - inside the renovated bungalow or outside in the lush patio - you cannot tell you're just steps off of busy Mill Avenue. It feels as though you have your own private party.  I am also a coffee snob and the bartender pulled a delectable, fresh decaf espresso (hard to do!)  Well worth the trip, whether you're celebrating a special occasion or just want to be spoiled by the staff and feel good as you walk away.",

Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. The patio is beautiful so we opted to sit outside. The table, glasses, silverware and napkins were covered with little leaves and detritus from the trees. We ended up having to clean it off ourselves when the hostess dropped the menus and scurried away. The food was reasonable, not bad but certainly not with the premium prices; and our waiter, though mostly competent, appeared to be quite stoned. None of the food was even interesting enough to report here. We had a nice evening with our friends, but wish we would have taken them to any of the myriad other excellent restaurants in the valley.",

Just steps from ASU we had lunch outside on the garden patio.  Evan and the service team was great and the food was surprisingly affordable.   We didn't take advantage of the full bar or the huge wine list, but I have been here before and the outdoor bar is worth experiencing on a cool evening.    The food: This is not your typical artichoke dip.  It has a great blend of spinach and green chili that make the smooth cheesy artichoke dip amazing with the fresh toasted baguette.  Best dip I can think of!  Garlicky smoked salmon Caesar salad: (Say that three times fast).  I like punchy Caesar dressing and this was no disappointment.  Between the capers and the garlic this salad is not for the faint of heart.  I was surprised when I bit into the cold smoked salmon.  The serving was so large I was expecting it to be a piece of grilled salmon.  This salad as big and delicious.    Pulled chicken sandwich: My son said it compared favorably to any pulled pork sandwich he had ever eaten, and I have dragged him to tons of BBQ spots.  There was a big portion of smoked BBQ chicken on top of fried pickles.  The buttermilk bun was obviously fresh.  I am going to try it the next time I come.  I am giving the potato salad its own line even though it was a side for the pulled chicken sandwich.  The potato salad has a noticeable vinegar taste that balances the starch of the potato and the bacon crumbles put it over the top.   Tempura shrimp and vegetables: Eight beautifully fried shrimp, pickled shitake mushrooms on a spring greens salad.  I had to pass on the shellfish, but my wife enjoyed it and everyone agreed their meals were top notch.    One small disappointment was the lemonade, this place is too nice to serve soda machine lemonade.  Oh well when life serves you generic lemonade drink margaritas!    Midrange fine dining and a unique downtown experience: Five stars!",

We had gone on a Saturday afternoon which wasn't too busy and they had conveniently seat us under two large umbrellas. They have a lovely patio area & with the perfect weather, we all really enjoyed the ambiance.  There were a variety of dishes ordered at our table .. The salmon with lettuce, the smoked pulled chicken sandwich, the frittata of the day, & the vegetarian sandwich. Everyone really enjoyed their food - the portions were big & the everyone agreed everything was really tasty. I was one who ordered the smoked pulled chicken sandwich. It was much different than any other BBQ chicken sandwich I've had -- it tasted good with the slaw, and the fried pickles added a unique flavor and crunch. I thought the highlight of the dish was the potato salad, however. The bacon added a special something but wasn't overpowering. I'd definitely recommend trying it out!  I will say that House of Tricks is a bit expensive for lunch time but it's a nice treat. I've heard great things about their dinner so I'm planning on returning for a date night!",

As a pescatarian, my options are limited to vegetarian and fish dishes. I ventured out from my usual fish dinner and ordered the mushroom etoufee. It was delicious! The mushrooms were meaty and the dish was superb. We always debate about which appetizer to order and inevitably order the smoked salmon. This time, we ordered the cheese plate and were not disappointed. Now, if only I could get House of Tricks to put the vegetarian meatball sandwich back on the lunch menu. It was easily the best lunch in metropolitan Phoenix! Or, perhaps share the recipe?",

She said that she would tell the manager about it but never said anything about it when she came back. You just expect more when you spend over $150 for two on a couple of meals and a half bottle of wine. Too bad I had high expectations but this is one place that will never see me again.",

The outside patio is quaint & covered with greenery, from vines to flowers, white linen with simple lighting in the evening. Such a quaint vibe. The food is always exciting! Fresh & delightful! The servers are attentive and not interruptive. I always look forward to my next visit. The best restaurant in Tempe hands down!",

The of them were during lunch time and their pasta and salmon salad are superb. I dont remember the name of the pasta but there is only one pasta on lunch menu. We alaways sat outside which has a jungle feel to it and has a good vibe. It is usually packed with people and u might want to make reservation ahead of time even though we never did and was just fine. The service has been usually good. BE ADVISED: it might not be good time to visit there for lunch, since there r some construction going on right across the restaurant.",

I was a little cautious when I saw the college town, but don't let that throw you off. It was a little cold out and I sat outside at the bar, I was promptly offered a blanket. What a nice touch!!  I ended up sitting next to two guests that were pretty familiar with the place. We ended up sharing food so I got to taste a lot and EVERYTHING was amazing. My favorite though was the mussels. I am a sucker for mussels but these were so unique. A creamy sauce with chorizo served with plenty of bread, YUM!!!!  I also ordered the bulgogi grilled cheese from happy hour. I tried from my new friends the special and the pork rilette which was also tasty. There were so many things I wanted to order.   For dessert I got something lighter. I went with the gelato/sorbet assortment. It was perfect. The bartender also gave me good hiking tips and was super personable.",

Ambiance is unique (it is in an old home) and has many outdoor options as well. Right on ASU's campus.  Cons: expensive, can be a wait, and many times you must reserve.

    "text": "I came here because I was in town from LA and trying to find quality food in Tempe, and this place more or less hit the spot! It's an \"upscale\" vibe in that the waiters announce every dish and wear white button-ups, but everyone dresses pretty casually. Kind of a Kanye-wears-sweats-to-Nobu kinda vibe.   My favorite part of the meal was my waitress, Siobhon! She was so friendly and personable it made me want to like the food. None of the entrees stood out to me so I got a bunch of starters:  Scallops - really delicious, light and had depth of flavor. Scallops were cooked perfectly and it made me really glad I was eating alone because there were only two of them. The hollandaise sauce it came with was really good, and the blue corn on the bottom of the scallops was a great touch!   Duck confit - for whatever reason they made it into an okonomiyaki (Japanese savory pancake). It was too salty and I got sick of the flavor quite quickly.   Mussels - it comes in a \"creamy sauce\" that's reminiscent of a butter chicken sauce and there's chorizo at the bottom. I didn't think the chorizo worked in the dish at all, and I would've liked more tomatoes, mussels, and maybe some lime to lighten up the dish. Comes with 3 enormous bread pieces.   Dessert special - a cream puff with chocolate spread and fresh strawberries with whipped cream on top. The chocolate was heavy for me so I skipped it, but otherwise I thought it was decent!  Overall I like that they try to be innovative with their menu, even if it doesn't always pan out. The staff are amazing and they clearly stick around because of the owners, who are also the restaurant's namesake.   This is not a bad dining choice considering this is an upscale restaurant in Tempe, Arizona. (Did I mention enough times that this is Arizona we are talking about?) I would recommend it because the service is so excellent and the owners seem open to feedback based on how they responded to other Yelp reviews.",

Prefer Kings Fish House, they ask how you want your fish grilled and they have two covered patio options.",

I went out of my comfort zone and had the lamb shank which was incredible and filling!! My girl ordered the salmon which seemed a little on the small side for $30, it was like 6 bites of fish really. Now I have never been a fan of salmon, but she insisted I try it and Im glad I did, I don't know what they did to it, but it was finally a piece of salmon I enjoyed.

I've been at 5 Star restaurants around the world and with these prices I expected the best!  The bread was uneatable, tiny slices of what seemed like bread that hadn't been baked long enough and was cold, plus, the real sign in my book that the management isn't concerned with details, the butter spread was hard, not spreadable.  What!?! If you can't get the basics right, what's the rest of the meal gonna be like.  Well, the House salad was fresh and tasty, however I ordered the scallops and the way it was described with carrots and another garnish, and that the waitress said they were quite large, was NOT the way it came; two teeny-weeny scallops.  When I made the reservation they asked if it was a special occasion and I thought, oh good, it was my friend's birthday, they probably do something special for that.  When it came time for dessert, the waitress brought the menu for us to choose and my friend oh how nice, we get to choose the complementary item.  Oh no, she said you'd have to pay for it.  What?  I said, you do nothing for a birthday?  Well, she said we put a candle on whatever you choose.   Oh and if you sit outside, the chairs are so unbearably uncomfortable, I had to go to my car to get some pillows! How this restaurant ever got 4 stars is beyond me.  Some of my local non-descript favorite restaurants in the area are soooooooooooo much better and much less expensive.  Never going back.",

    "text": "What happened? I hadn't been to House of Tricks in years when four of us decided to go there for lunch. The service was still friendly but it started out badly. Despite our reservations we were seated in the middle of traffic near the kitchen. Not the worst thing but more of an omen of things to come. The Bloody Mary I ordered was too spicy for me but there was no offer to adjust the heat. Instead our waitress said \"I can bring you tomato juice.\"  The cheese and fruit plate was a bad joke. There was barely any cheese or nuts or fruit. The dishes we ordered were all disappointingly mediocre at best. I don't think any of us took home leftovers though there was plenty left on our plates. House of Tricks used to be wonderful. I won't go back.",

Very romantic with perfect ambience. Our server was great, very pleasant , and knowledgeable about the wines. I had an exceptional Chardonnay. Ok now for the downfall, it was my sisters birthday and she ordered the Cornish game hen. Very salty and skin was burnt. Our server did offer another dish but my sister declined. The cheese platter which we ordered as an appetizer was very uneventful and sparse! Only offered 4 to 5 cheeses some nuts and 5 grapes! No other fruit that they show in pictures that other patrons have taken. All of our main entrees for the price, which is extremely expensive, just didn't make the grade, with the exception of the beef tenderloin, which my daughter ordered. She enjoyed that very much. All in all this was very disappointing. I was looking forward to coming to this quaint little gem in Tempe, but I'm not sure that I'll be back.",

    "text": "The staff was wonderfully accommodating and attentive. We came to House of Tricks for Restaurant Week.   For starters we had Scallops with squid ink caviar and the Apple frisee salad. The entrees were, Sauteed Shrimp, Bacon and Sweet Peppers on a Lacy Corn Cakes with Bourbon Creme Fraiche and Confit Mango and Sierra Nevada Mustard Braised Rabbit Leg and Golden Beet Gnocchi with Aged Balsamic Vinegar Reduction and Crispy Kale. For Dessert, Salame di Cioccolato and Espresso Gelato with Hazelnut Brittle and Sugar Crusted Moist Butter Cake with Blackberry Compote and Granola Crumble  The scallop was well prepared and the ink caviar was interesting. It was a little fishy smelling, but that is squid ink afterall.  The Apple Frisee salad was very very good. Of particular note were the toasted hazelnuts which provided a nice textural contrast and that wonderful crunch.  The sweet and tart contrast in the salad was expertly constructed.  The entrees ordered were on the whole, very disappointing. We ordered the Rabbit leg and the sauteed shrimp.  The sauteed shrimp were inconsistently cooked. More that half of the shrimp were undercooked. The chef would do well to season the shrimp before cooking them. My God, a little salt even. This dish relied exclusively upon the Bourbon Creme Fraiche for flavor. But the fraiche was too oily and left a slickness on the palate.  I didn't even notice any bacon or sweet peppers flavors in this dish. The dish needs some heat to bring it home.  The other dish,  Sierra Nevada Mustard Braised Rabbit Leg and Golden Beet Gnocchi with Aged Balsamic Vinegar Reduction and Crispy Kale. The only redeeming part of this dish were the Golden Beet Gnocchi. The Gnocchi was expertly seasoned and prepared. The Rabbit was unfortunately terribly under seasoned and dry.  The Salame di Cioccolato was nice.  The Salame was more akin to fudge. It incorporated some great flavors. A subtle taste of amaretto, though it wasn't listed. The Espresso Gelato was smooth and flavorful. The brittle was the star. Brillant.  The Sugar Crusted Moist Butter Cake with Blackberry Compote and Granola Crumble was something my aunt Mable would bring to a potluck. The \"Moist Butter Cake\" was neither moist  nor buttery. The cake could have been from Sara Lee, but I'm not sure The blackberry compote was uncomplicated and could have come out of a can. The coup de gras was the lack of any granola crumble.  Again, the wait staff was exceptional. The chef needs to watch the Food Channel.",

The hostess was opposite of friendly. She seemed stressed and in a bad mood and I have no idea why because they weren't busy at all.  We were seated and at first I was thrilled with our table. It was private and placed between two trees. I soon realized it was not so peachy when the wait staff kept using it as a walkway. It was a tight space and each time they slid through I thought they were going to bump my arm. It was so annoying!    FOOD- just alright. I had the tagliatelle pasta and it was so saucy with way too much pesto. Disappointing.  SERVICE- she started off well and then towards the end was very slow and not attentive.    All in all the experience was not that great and I would say try somewhere else as this restaurant seems hit or miss. Also,it is pricey so you would think they would have excellent staff to give their customers a nice experience from start to finish, part of what you are paying for correct?",

    "text": "While in Tempe for some spring training games, my husband and I came here for our anniversary dinner.  We arrived a bit early for our reserved time so we found a nice spot at the bar for a cocktail.  I ordered a house specialty called a \"Crunchy Squirrel.\"  Weird name, strange taste.  Shoulda known better.  The atmosphere is pretty nice on the candle-lit patio, but they have to provide flashlights so you can read the menu. Good thing we showered and changed after the game because it wasn't what I would classify as \"casual\" attire. Most people were dressed in nice date-night attire like us.  By the time I finished my squirrelly drink, the sweet little hostess had tracked us down to seat us. (She was the friendliest staff person we encountered all  evening.) She gave us what seemed to be a pretty nice, intimate little table, but as the evening grew cooler and a little breezy, it became clear that we were too far from the heaters.   Our server was very professional but not overly friendly. He had to read the specials from a cheat sheet which didn't seem very knowledgeable or enthusiastic. Our food came out relatively quick but to my disappointment, it was only luke warm and I am a stickler about eating my food HOT. Nevertheless, we both enjoyed our small, expensive portions of grilled salmon and lobster.  Presentation was very nice, but as for taste, the entrees were \"okay.\" Not bad, but not mouth-wateringly yummy, either.  Especially for the prices. Since we were still hungry, we ordered some delish decadent desserts. They were much tastier than the dinner.  Overall, I'd say this is a nice place to come for drinks and/or dessert, but the dinner was a bit disappointing.",

    "text": "For my inlaws last evening here in the Valley, we went to House of Tricks in Tempe because they wanted to try it based on a recommendation of one of their friends back in Ohio.  The patio area is really pretty and we were lucky to get a table toward the back of the patio because it was a tad more secluded and we had better views of the beautiful flowers in the garden. The only bad thing about the location was there was not a light overhead like other tables on the patio so you had to hold your menu up to the candlelight to read it.  The wine list is quite extensive, but we decided to go simple and had the Columbia Valley Riesling which was crisp and smooth. For appetizers we had the cheese plate and the mushroom flan.  My inlaws loved the flan and said it had good flavor. The cheese plate was delicious...their was blue cheese, brie, and two other cheeses.  All were very nice and there was a nice amount of apples, grapes, and strawberries as well.  For dinner, I had a caesar salad and the scallop appetizer. The salad was a perfect size and the dressing was really nice and had a good garlic kick without being overpowering.  The scallops were fine...not to die for or worth ordering again, but not bad. There was a little broth on the plate that was very tasty. I could have done without the lima beans that accompanied it.  My husband had the sea bass (it comes de-boned for you) which he enjoyed; my father in law had the salmon based on their friend's recommendation which he liked a lot; and my mother in law had the duck which she liked, but she did not enjoy the blackberry vinagrette that came with it.  We tried two desserts, the apple crisp and the triple mousse tower, and both were excellent.  For two appetizers, four meals, two desserts, and 2 bottles of wine, our bill came to $195 before tip.  Our waitress was very nice but service was very slow and not up to par with what you would expect at a place with the level of prices that House of Tricks has.  My other negative about HOT is that it is loud when you sit outside. Between the mosque music, the traffic on the streets around HOT, and some other random noises from the immediate area, it is very distracting and takes away from the atmosphere and sereneness of the restaurant.",

I only dined outside, but honestly with such beautiful weather 9 months out of the year here, why would you dine any other way!   The service was excellent! The staff was extremely attentive and always checked up on me while I drank water and waited a while for my friend. The menu was amazing. I never once read a menu that I wanted to try everything on here. They had a huge variety of dishes at what I can only describe as American/French fusion. It all looked so divine. And from what I've been told, their menu changes frequently to new seasonal dishes. So I can't wait to see what they offer when I return. I went simple with my meal having this delicious quiche, fresh fruit and a cup of their corn chowder soup. The soup was so rich and creamy, I could have ordered and ate a whole trough! It was that good. The fruit was clean, well portioned and fresh. I'm very particular with fruit, and hate when the fruit looks soggy and overly ripened. And the quiche was heavenly as well. Just the right amount of ham and tomatoes with alot of flavor.  Since I was here for lunch only, the prices were reasonable. I've heard at dinner it can get expensive.  This was an unforgettable dining experience and recommend this to everyone to try at least once.",

    "text": "What the....? I've never yelped house of tricks? For shame! Some of the best meals I've ever had in tempe were at this mill ave. legend. Don't be thrown by the \"mill ave.\" portion of my previous statement - it's far enough back from the p.f. chang's, cue clubs and fat tuesdays to keep the college crowd from interrupting your $34 filet with shouts of \"jaegerbombers!\" plus, the price point isn't exactly student-friendly (which is why I rarely get to eat here).  That usually means I come here for special occasion meals like birthdays and promotions, which typically entails a bottle of wine, two entrees, an app and a dessert ($100 for two people, easy). But I have, on occasion, come for happy hour drinks at the outdoor, four-sided bar. The restaurant is made up of two early 20th century homes connected by a large wooden deck and spacious patio. Most of the seating is outside, so in the hot or cold months take that into consideration. They have two fireplaces and plenty of heat lamps, but in January I still ate with my coat on. Not sure what sort of relief they have in the summer - though it is shaded by a canopy of trees and has plenty of flowers and greenery to keep you cool...ish.  I've never been disappointed in the food. My sister swears their ahi tuna is the best she's ever tasted (she orders it in any restaurant that offers it). and she must not be the only one because they always have it on the menu, which they otherwise change seasonally. I'm a steak girl myself, but the cold weather of my last visit prompted a short rib bourguignonne order, which was fantastic. Two people in our party did opt for the filet mignon served with coconut milk mashed potatoes (wha...??? Yummers!) and lovey-love-loved it.  The service can be spotty... the bar, host and wait staff was a little green for a Saturday night. bartenders were not rude, but... a tad sophomoric for a place that has $80 bottles of wine on the menu. Our hostess was nice enough to move our table closer to the firepit, but never brought the heat lamp she promised. The server seemed to be on his third night of serving ever - forgot an appetizer and was easily confused and in a hurry - probably waiting to get cut so he could head to a kegger. No one on the staff we interacted with was over the age of 20....seems odd for a fancier place like HoT.   But, for being the only place of this caliber I can think of in all of tempe, I'll take it.",

He was not upscale waiter material by any means, more like Keanu Reeves trying to serve. \"Whoa, need some wine dude?\" I Had to send him back to the chef to ask about food Ingredients . Had no idea. Thats no good when average prices for plates are around $25. Small portions for the price. I know it is upscale cuisine but I was starving after my $29 meal. The herbed butter with bread was too powerful. Should be a subtle flavor. It was good but not worth going back to IMO.",

    "text": "*edit* i just returned tonight to celebrate my grad school acceptance with my bf. i was pretty saddened. not by the food (although the braised short ribs is more like pot roast than short ribs... and a little too saucy). ok, the dessert did suck and is worth skipping. and our waitress was terrrrrible! she was surly and not helpful. we were at the restaurant for TWO hours. and it was not even busy.! she didn't even end up bringing us the bill - we had to ask for the bill, and a different waitress (who was really nice) brought it to us. bad service is a huuuuge turnoff to me. fortunately, the seared ahi tuna is still amazing. and so is the cheese plate appetizer. yeah, HOT lost a star from me tonight. it was allll that waitress' (and nasty dessert's) fault.  the food that dreams are made of.... this small hidden restaurant just down the block from Mill Ave is a True gem. i actually chose to eat here for my birthday after reading some reviews on Yelp, and have now come back to return the favor! in all honesty, i think this is my fave restaurant in ALL of the Phoenix area!   we started off with the cheese plate... oh baby! they had a fantastic selection of delectable cheeses that i would probably never choose for myself - i just wish i knew the names of the cheeses as i was eating them. and i wish there was more cheese to go around!   i ordered the pork chop with coconut mashed potatoes (yeah everything had super pretty gourmet names, but i can't remember that many words....) deeeee-lish! perfect complement.  although my dinner was awesome, i kinda wanted to steal my bf's dinner more... he ordered the seared ahi tuna over masa pancake. it was incredible. i think i'm always amazed by good seafood in Arizona. and HOT (haha, nice acronym) does an amazing job.  super cute date place. (two thumbs up to my man for taking me here!) perfect romantic atmosphere for l-o-v-e, and sitting outside is refreshing in the fall/spring. when it's crowded, though, it's not as intimate, but still cozy. i'd recommend dining here in the middle of the week for a nice intimate dinner. or lunch. just eat here. you won't be disappointed!!!!",

    "text": "Legend, legend, legend, legendary.  My personal history has been intertwined with House of Tricks since I was roughly 16.  It was at this age I realized how to be a man and by man I mean how to treat a woman.  And quite frankly, Tricks has played something of an advisory role for many major manformative years thereafter.   Obvious hyperbole alert:  This place is so romantic that even if a clown juggling three chihuahuas rode through the patio in on a unicycle every 20 minutes you'd still get laid.  There is in no fathomable way I could dissect dishes or service or ambiance as I have been there literally over a hundred times.  Therefore, you'll just have to look elsewhere for a play-by-play of the dishes (as they also seasonally change menu items it renders this task improbable if not impossible).  What I can say about some food related items is this: First, the lavender crusted tuna from 2002 haunts me like a lost love to this day; and second, the grilled lemon caper salmon salad quite possibly changed my life.  Capers...who knew right?  What Tricks has to offer the patron is the quintessential personal dining experience.  The service is good but laid back...they will leave your party be for the most part.  This is not supposed to be a 5 star restaurant so it doesn't try to be.  What they do is provide a platform for their guests to enjoy their friends, family, lovers or liaisons to the fullest.  At the same time they are treated with impeccable food, great presentation, and a wonderful setting all very effortlessly.  Go here on a date.  Go here for after work/school drinks (bar area is amazing).  Go here for lunch with parents.  Just go here.",

We didn't have reservations, but they were able to seat us right away on the beautiful outdoor patio.  This is an upscale restaurant that caters more to romantic dates and special celebrations, but we were more than comfortable dining in our comfy travel attire.  We had a hard time deciding on what to eat, but I think we would've been satisfied no matter what we chose.  My son had the Caesar Salad to start and the Beef Tenderloin entree, while I had the Spicy Clam Chowder followed by The Scallops.  Both our entrees were delicious.  We ended our meal by splitting the Flourless Chocolate Cake...mmmmmmm.   Our waiter was professional but a little slow to respond due to the fact that he was juggling a few large parties.  If you are looking for a place to celebrate an anniversary, birthday, promotion, etc., I'd give this place a try.",

    "text": "This has always been a favorite of ours for dinner before an event at Gammage, so this isn't the first time we have been here, but it will be the last. Seriously. While I have never been overly impressed with House of Tricks, my girlfriend has, and the atmosphere is pretty nice. For me, the food has always been just ok, not bad, but not anything special in this city of really good restaurants. The service in the past has always been pretty good, but Saturday night was a whole different story from the bottom to the top.   We had reservations for 5:15 for a 7:30 show at Gammage. Plenty of time, right? Well, it wasn't. We showed up 5:15 and were seated about 5:30. Crowded? Not really. We spied about a half dozen empty tables. There was a line at the hostess station, and it was obvious it was a first night of work for someone, or maybe a couple of their first nights. It took almost 5 minutes for them to seat parties even though there were a lot of empty tables.   So, about 10 minutes later, a young woman approached us and said she was not our server, but that she would bring us some water. She asked if we were going to Gammage, and we said yes. The server would be told this, we were assured. About 5:45 we ordered a bottle of wine when our water arrived. It showed up about 5:55. Upon opening the wine, a server knocked my glass of water into my lap. Really, not that big of a deal at the time, as I was wearing black pants, and accidents happen. Our actual server finally showed up, and we told her we were now in a bit of a hurry, since it was now about 6:00. No problem. We ordered three Caesar salads and a bowl of soup, and our entrees.   By the time the salads arrived at 6:20, we knew we might be in trouble on time, but the server told us that the kitchen knew that we needed to leave soon for the play. 5:50 soon rolled around, and we knew there was no way for us to stay and eat. When we informed the server, she said our meals still weren't ready anyway. She kept blaming the kitchen. The manager (?) apologized, and said he would comp the salads and cup of soup. Big of him. The wine was a $42 bottle of wine they paid $20 for. He should have comped it, too. Really, we weren't looking for anything free here, but he made sure that we weren't ever coming back, and he could have prevented that by making a gesture for the water in my lap and the overall bad service. Not only have they lost our patronage, but we brought friends along from out of town who come into town for events at Gammage, and their feelings were the same.   To be honest, there are just way too many good restaurants in town to be treated this way and just to be told they were sorry. This place has a great atmosphere and decent food. That's not enough anymore in this day and age. Someone mentioned in another review that House of Tricks seems to be having some issues with service around this time-frame. It is unfortunate that it happens to anyone, but for us its unacceptable.",

Maybe the trick here is they charge 10 bucks for a drowned sandwich but throw in the dirty dishes for free.",

Through local recommendations, I chose House of Tricks to take a friend for Valentine's lunch...and before I go any further, let me just say that I am SO happy we came here!   Location--kinda random. Next to the university, and directly next to a mosque and Muslim market. (Turns out market has the world's best hazelnut baklava--go get some!) Once you get closer you can see the cute outdoor tables in the little garden area that conjure up thoughts of a Parisian outdoor cafe. Nice!   I'll admit, one of the reasons I chose this place was for it's wine menu (glug glug.) They had a special wine of the day, which was great, and pretty reasonable at $6 per glass.   The food is where this place really shines though...the menu is so interesting, and everything sounds amazing and incredibly fresh. We decided on a goat cheese cake appetizer, served with tapenade, basil, roasted red peppers, and crispy slices of bread--YUM! For an entree I had the grilled slightly spicy calamari, shrimp, and tuna with Israeli cous cous and spinach, and my friend had the phyllo dough wrapped orange roughy with coconut milk and veggies. Both of our dishes were delicious, and we loved the uniqueness of the flavor combinations. For dessert we ordered a bread pudding dish and a tirimisu, with two cappucinos. Our bill was about $80 but we each had 2 glasses of wine, shared an appetizer, each got an entree, and followed it with two desserts and two cappucinos. Not bad for all of that food, if we had just gotten lunch entrees I would consider it a great deal at around $12 per entree.  Service was great, and it was the perfect location for a romantic, lazy lunch on a beautiful day.  My friend was only half-joking when he suggested going back on Sunday....",

We were seated outside in the courtyard section and we thoroughly enjoyed it, especially with the weather being so goo this time of the year! It was a cozy and romantic setting.The ambiance is nice and their service was very good too. Between the both of us, we ordered the lamb shank and the tenderloin steak. The lamb shank was served on a bed of cheese risotto, which was a very interesting combination. The lamb was cooked real well and the meat just fell off the bone. The only flip side to the dish I would say was, there was too much cheese flavor going on, so sometimes I felt the flavor of lamb was getting lost (it could just be me too!). The steak was juicy and moist and husband enjoyed the dish a lot. Both the dishes were plated n served really well. And to finish the day on sweet note, we ordered their dessert special for the night, which was creme brulee with pumpkin filling and I must say, it was a total winner! Though their pricing is slightly on the higher side, the place is worth a visit. Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and a great time there!",

Right now they're got restaurant week going on and for $30 bucks you can get a gnarly three course meal.  I got:  Coconut curry shrimp, Asian meatballs served over a bed of goat cheese and a dulce de leche cheesecake brownie for dessert with a cup of decaf coffee.  Unfuckingbelievable.  Sometimes when you eat food that is that good, something that soars into that level of greatness, it makes every dish you made that you were oh, so proud of look like a piece of shit.  Did you ever bust your ass and cook something that took all day?  Did you ever make your own turkey stock for gumbo you made and the whole affair took all Sunday and you never even went outside?

I felt that the mustard glaze was just spooned on and not actually part of the cooking process. There was too much of the glaze and it completely overpowered the salmon. The \"toasted \" rice tasted like plain old brown rice and the overcooked bok choy didn't go well with the other flavors.   My husband ordered the bison meat loaf. A small portion and nothing special. He loves purple potatoes but did not enjoy them as they were pureed to the consistency of baby food.   Disappointing food for that price point.  I'm giving it 3 stars because the mussels were so good (although they could have been bigger). We were there on a Monday night so perhaps the \"A\" kitchen team was not there but I would hope that food would be consistent no matter when you dine. Probably would not return unless a friend recommended a particular item on the menu",

    "text": "We have been wanting to try this place out for a few years, so we went for my husband's birthday with several relatives. I suppose of minor concern was the fact that several staff members (including our waiter) knew it was my husband's birthday, but nothing at all special was done about it, nor was it acknowledged in any way. Okay, so apparently recognizing special occasions is not their thing... Not a super big deal, but I thought I'd mention in case this happens to be why you are going.  The outdoor patio dining area is GORGEOUS. However, it was a little cold and quite windy, so we opted to sit inside. What a contrast! Big, plain, drab, empty, boxy, boring room, with poor aesthetics. We had to yell at each other in order to hear one another (sort of), and there weren't even that many other people seated in this room to excuse it from feeling like we were eating in a school cafeteria. Our waiter was friendly enough. He forgot a few minor things and took away every single one of my (4!) forks for eating my actual dinner, but nothing unforgivable. Nothing outstanding though, either.  I realize this isn't \"fast food\", and we don't expect that at all, but, the food really did take forever. I don't know how long it was from the time of order until we got our salads, but at that time we were told it would be another 15-20 minutes, when, in fact, it took 30 minutes to receive our dinners after the salads. There were two children in our party, who had to be taken outside and walked around and entertained TWICE for 20 minutes while waiting for our food.  None of these things individually would I consider deal-breakers, except for the fact that we spent a total of $280+ for 7 people (2 of them children under the age of 7), so I do think we should be able to expect more. So far, a place like Applebee's is doing better than this (and at about 1/3 of the price.) And then the food comes. (The deal-breaker for my relatives.) My husband said his meal was good, and the food we ordered for the kids was okay. (Although, we ordered them an \"adult\" meal of gnocchi to share, and I couldn't believe how small the serving was! In any other restaurant I've been in, the serving would have been 2-3 times more.)  The side salad that I ordered (a la carte - $7!), was TINY!!! Seriously?!?! They think it's worth a DOLLAR for each little salad leaf?! (I'm really NOT exaggerating.) The lamb that I ordered (which my waiter claimed was a \"meal and a half\", was only that by comparison to the other meals.) I did expect it to be fatty, because lamb is... but I didn't find hardly any meat, and was in no way full when I left. Certainly no \"and-a-half\" meal leftover.  The lamb was fairly salty, but, managed to stay on the high end of \"still acceptable/edible\" to me. However, the mashed potatoes that my aunt and I had? The description left by a previous reviewer, \"it was eye squinting salty\", is perfectly accurate. My aunt could only choke down two bites before she gave up. My other aunt said her meal was quite salty too and was surprised that her squash, which would usually been on the sweeter side, obviously had added salt.  To me, over-salting is an attempt to make up for a lack of culinary skill. \"When in doubt, salt the hell out of it!\" Either the chef doesn't have much talent at using other ingredients and seasonings to bring out delicious flavors, or he doesn't THINK he does...or he enjoys snacking on salt licks.  In any event, my relatives definitely won't be back. There is a small chance I would be willing to give it another try - but only on a nice day so that we could sit out on the lovely patio and order from the (significantly less expensive, therefore less financially risky) lunch menu and I'll ask if there are any low-salt options.",

My first two visits here were great but I had only ordered appetizers so I'll give it three stars in fairness of my other visits being great. Sad to say my most recent visit was just okay. I had the Filet Mignon and was so disappointed. While the meat was a good cut and it was cooked to my specifications it was incredibly salty. So salty I couldn't even finish it. We came with a large group of people so I really didn't want to send it back. Even my mashed potatoes were laced with salt. :(  After dinner I asked my friends how their meals were and across the table we agreed they had been a bit overly friendly with the salt shaker in the kitchen.  The atmosphere and service on the other hand are always great. Unfortunately, I need some space and time to think House of Tricks. It's not you, it's me and I guess I just don't love salt as much as you.",

    "text": "Had the pleasure of enjoying House of Tricks last night, for the second time in the past twelve months.  With a party of six, I was excited to get to see a range of dishes and try out most of the menu via my dining companions choices.  The restaurant, found in Tempe near ASU, is not hard to find and houses both indoor and outdoor seating.  The outdoor seating is where we ended up last night and between the fire pit in the middle of the grounds and the abundance of trees/greenery, the setting works quite well.    Our party was seated immediately and without problem, the night was off to a solid start.  Our waitress, Jamie, was both friendly and courteous.  Jamie had a great understanding of the menu, the specials and especially the wine.  Her recommendations for multiple members of the party worked out perfectly.  Each person in our party ordered an appetizer and off we went.  I had the pork belly, on Jamie's suggestion. Other choices within our party included the salmon cake, sweetbreads two ways, and the scallops.  I thought the pork belly was great. It had a pea puree as a base sauce and some baby carrots that just killed.  The scallops were tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sweetbreads two ways were a bit of a letdown.  As a lover of sweetbreads, I have had the pleasure of tasting some of the best variations of there preparation. These were just not that great.  They weren't cooked properly and the seasoning was lacking.  This would be the only lacking dish of the evening.  For the entree, I had the pork osso bucco.  This was a real treat, cooked evenly, tender and tasty.  Other entree selections around the table included the ahi tuna, the salmon, and the duck.  The tuna was the standard seared variety on a bed of mashed potatoes.  Both diners who chose this selection were quite satisfied.  My companion had the duck and while she certainly enjoyed the dish, she found the duck slightly fatty.  All around, the entrees were solid and plates were cleaned.    With little room left for dessert, we ordered three selections for the table to share.  All were good and once again our plates were cleaned off.  The dessert best was agreed upon to be the homemade smore the restaurant produces.    All in all, this is a solid restaurant with a good atmosphere and good service.  I would eat here again and recommend you to do the same.",

    "text": "TL;DR - good not great. Not worth the price, and especially not worth the time I spent. The waitstaff was helpful and the atmosphere is lovely, but overall I came away underwhelmed, even with a comped entree.  You're better off going somewhere like Ocotillo or Barrio Cafe or the Henry at this price point.   I was excited to try this place out. Came here for a birthday dinner, somewhat large party of 12 or so, so take that into consideration. However. It was still very slow service, and nothing we got was overly complicated. About 4 hours from table to bill (with dessert albeit). Of course as you probably know, it's a pricy establishment. But that sets the expectations higher.   I started with a cocktail. Some variation on the gin and tonic. It was good but not great. I've certainly had better, it doesn't take much: Hendricks, tonic and cucumber.  I was hoping to order the Seabass, but as our waiter came to take our entree orders (about 45 minutes into the experience), he alerted us they were out. That's okay, a lot of us ended up ordering either the salmon or the seared ahi. The waiter came back about 10 minutes later to alert us that the ahi was also gone, so I switched to salmon.   My beet and arugula salad came out and presentation was great, as was the flavor. However at that size and at that price there wasn't anything that especially stood out. Oh well. The candied walnuts were super tasty.   Finally after a long time. The entrees were brought. The portions at least seemed appropriate. The chef came by to let us know that those of us who ordered the ahi would have our entrees comped. Hooray!   As for the meal. Salmon was cooked to a good consistency (though I would prefer a bit rarer). The bed of black grains was striking and added a great texture. The ricotta complimented both quite well. In fact, it may have been the most flavorful thing on the plate. The salmon unfortunately was not very flavorful, and the grain lacked seasoning. Perhaps my tastes are unrefined.   As it was a birthday occasion, a few of us ordered dessert. Since the entree was comped and I was at this point underwhelmed, I ordered the special. A butter cake with vanilla gelato. It was also good, not great. I expected more richness from something called butter cake.",

    "text": "Multiple times returning guest. We love House of Tricks. Cozy and very comfortable atmosphere with EXCELLENT food. Front of house (hostess station) needs some attitude adjustment. We arrived on a Friday for lunch at 12:30 and requested to sit outside on patio. Hostess asked if we had a reservation, which we didn't, but didn't seem willing to seat or accommodate us. Here's the issue, they have maybe 30 to 40 tables out on patios and we counted FOUR of them occupied with the remainder set and available.  Get the feeling?",

    "text": "We went here for our 5 year anniversary. We had reservations at 7 pm and we went a little early to have a glass of wine at the bar. We ordered a bottle of wine and a appetizer. There was 2 bartenders and they were very very busy. People were waiting for drinks all around us. We decided to eat at the bar instead of waiting for our table so we got menus. I called earlier in the day to ask if they had the lamb they said yes and that they had a bunch of specials as well. Turns out they didn't have lamb and had NO specials. Took about 20 minutes to order our dinner. We sat for about an hour and 40 minutes later and still only had our app and wine. We politely asked for our Check and left hungry. Bartender was super nice and apologetic but after sitting for an hour and 40 minutes we order a steak med rare and grouper and it still didn't come it was time .  Well now in regards to your post maybe you should talk to your Bartender because we bought a bottle of wine when we sat down at 6:03 at the bar I took a picture of it on my phone and that's the time stamp so sorry 1 hour and 45 minutes for a med rare steak and a fish. The wine was the best part of this experience. Yes he did buy us an appetizer which was very nice of him. Yes we also missed the happy hour app by technically 5 minutes from when we sat, but by the time it got put it was longer so yes thank you to the kitchen for making my delish appetizer. What a joke. Maybe you should hire more people to help because everyone around us was waiting and saying the same thing. But thank you for your remarkable response. We also tried to pay for our meal he said no problem I'll take care of it i understand it's my fault. We did get a $5 bill and still tipped him $40. Still stick with my 2 stars. Thanks again",

    "text": "I've heard rave reviews about this place so my rating might be skewed by expectations vs. experience. Everyone I told I was eating here had nothing but amazing things to say so the bar was set pretty high.   Had reservations before a show at Gammage and showed up a few minutes early on a Friday night. The hostess/es were very scattered. It took about 5 minutes to get acknowledged. They kept whispering back and forth and would help  coworkers but wouldn't even look at us. When they finally did acknowledge us, there was a line of people of waiting. They told us it would be a few minutes to get seated because they didn't have menus. There were a lot of tables open so it seemed odd. We moved to the side so others could check in but they didn't acknowledge them. They then forgot our names... overall just not what I was expecting from a place that's supposed to be a nicer restaurant.   Seated outside as requested. Just a warning, it's beautiful but the tree leaves fall everywhere. We had leaves in our drinks, food, hair, you name it!   Our server was EXCELLENT. He was on top of our orders and very friendly. The wait staff/bussers were very efficient and cleared items quickly.   Scallops were probably the highlight of the meal. They lacked the sear you typically get but they were cooked perfectly, tender and sweet.   My husband ordered the volcanic pork (not pictured in this review). He had heard it was a must order but didn't love it. It was tender but a little on the sweet side and semi-difficult to eat. There wasn't much heat to it, I think the \"volcanic\" part references how it looks when it is served (like a volcano).   I ordered the halibut that was on special. It is cooked in parchment and you unwrap it. The interactive part was fun. The fish was perfectly cooked and moist. The dish as a whole lacked flavor. The umami gave it an earthy flavor profile and the black garlic didn't taste present. There also wasn't much texture, it was a very one note dish. I'd not order this again.   I wasn't incredibly impressed with the menu options. I ordered the Halibut because it was the only thing that stood out to me. All the appetizers looked amazing, a table near us ordered just 3 appetizers (the Korean ribs and mussels looked delicious, third one was scallops) and I felt like they did it right.   Wine and cocktail selection was great, enjoyed what we indulged in. We were given a small taste of champagne as a celebration of our anniversary. It was excellent and a thoughtful touch.   We didn't order dessert, we were too full. People around us ordered the bread pudding which seemed popular.   I don't have a desire to go back, if I did it would maybe be for lunch or just drinks/appetizers IF we were with people who wanted to try this place. For this price range there are a lot of other places we'd prefer to go.",

Honestly, I can't take all the credit of finding this place, I had come here based on a recommendation of a friend and also hearing from another friend that he proposed to his now wife here. You know it can't be bad at that rate. And it wasn't.  The patio is amazing. Hands down, get a seat outside, if you get the choice. When the weather is beautiful, and even when it's not. The hubby and I stopped by for lunch for his early birthday celebration and was not disappointed. We got the toasted green chile cornbread BLT and the green curry crispty tofu bowl with the sauteed veggie medley as our appetizer. Presentation was gorgeous - I never thought sauteed vegetables could look so good and paired with goat cheese, the sweetness of the vegetables balanced the dish out perfectly.  I was drawn to the BLT not just because it was a BLT, but the cornbread and green chile twist on the BLT really caught my eye. I wish there was a little more green chile, honestly, but I'm a green chile freak and love me some cornbread so this was a definite winner in my book. And if you're a fan of green curry, the fact that it was tofu instead of chicken or whatever else green curry usually comes with - it didn't bother me one bit, and I usually can't do without my meats. The curry was also rich, but not sickeningly so, and also super flavorful, so that's a thumbs up from me.  All in all, this makes the list for special occasions, or a brunch/lunch date, for sure.",

It was a cold evening (by Phoenix standards, at least), so we opted to dine inside.  We were seated by the door where it was still a bit chilly... and when we asked to move to another table, the staff was more than accommodating and allowed us to sit at any open table!  After getting settled, we ordered some drinks.  The bourbon apricot sour and l'avventura were our drinks of choice.  Both are highly recommended!  For a starter, we ordered the Korean style BBQ rib appetizer.  Delish!  My entree was the pork shank.  If you are a fan of pork shank, then you have no need to look at the menu any further... just get the pork shank!  Amazing!  *****FIVE STARS*****",

We went here for our 18th wedding anniversary. There are a couple of tables inside but most of the seating is outside under the canopy of gorgeous trees. There are plants everywhere - you're literally eating in a beautiful garden. We went at 5 and snagged the last table at the bar - lucky us. The bar is elevated so you can look down into the seating in the garden. It's just so beautiful. This time of year is gorgeous! The food is creative and delicious, drinks are good, and the bartender that was serving us was fabulous.   TIP: GET RESERVATIONS!! We got so lucky to get a table in the bar area - it was the only one left.",

I recommend going for lunch. It's much cheaper than dinner.",

It's located near the university but there's plenty of parking nearby. The patio has mature trees, a peaceful garden feel, and an amazing circular bar outside!   The inside of the restaurant is an older house. It's a maze of books and crannies; it has its own little romantic charm. The staff is friendly and laid back, but once again for me -- it's the veggie variety on the menu and the ambiance outside that has sold me. I'll definitely be back for more.",

I had the salmon salad with risotto cake and it is definitely the best salad I have had in the state. The servers are nice and there is such a relaxing atmosphere.

We shared the oysters and pork belly apps and then each person covered the main menu.  All dishes were outstanding.  Prepared perfectly and garnished to highlight visual as well as taste.

We made a reservation 2 hours before the show started which should have been enough time to eat to get to the play in time.  The waitress took forever to get to our table, about 10-15 minutes. We ordered right away to make sure we would get to the play in time. Our appetizers arrived about 15 minutes later and then our entrees arrived about an hour after we ordered them. We had to eat our $30 entrees in 10 minutes to get to the play on time. On top of that, my steak was not prepared right.

    "text": "A group of us took our artist friend for his birthday last night.   It was the third time I'd been there with the first two times being pretty decent experiences, but this time I was very disappointed, as were the majority of our table mates.  First off, plan on spending a small fortune for substandard meals.  I don't know if the chef that night was having a bad day, but here's the rundown.....we ordered 4-appetizers, the wild boar, pork belly, tuna and artisian cheese plate....I'd say they were \"meh.\"  For the entree, I ordered today's fish which was a light whitefish.  It was bland, not cooked properly and very underwhelming.  My boyfriend got the sirloin and it was dry and almost inedible.  He said \"the worst steak he's ever had was better than that one.\"  The cut was bad and the sides were a joke.  Our birthday guest ordered the lamb, he requested it be prepared \"medium\" it was \"very rare\" - they did take the lamb off the bill as it was THAT bad.  Friend of ours ordered the black bean \"meatloaf\" I had a bite it was dry and not that flavorful.  Service slid off after the main course as the server was hit or miss.  Most of the time if we needed something, we were telling our bus boy as he was more attentive than the server.  Our table for 8 was crammed in a room with a table for 4 and table for 2, it was so loud in there you couldn't even carry on a conversation.  Not to mention we were so tightly packed in, you had to do the \"walk sideways and suck in your gut manoeuvre\" to squeeze between the tables if you had to get up from the table for any reason.  I chose this place because I thought it would be a nice special occasion place in Tempe for our dear friend.  He didn't enjoy it, we spent way too much money for disappointing food, service and table setup and we will likely never go there again.  I would not recommend House of Tricks in fact, I'll likely be telling people about our experience to steer them away from here.  I knew we should've went to Caffe Boa instead.",

But the place was packed, so maybe it's just me?  But I've had wonderful dishes for the same price and less at places like the Vig and Fuego Bistro....

    "text": "House of Tricks is located near ASU, surrounded by the hustle and bustle of the college town and the famous Mill Ave. You'd never expect to find a quaint and classy restaurant in the midst of crazy college life.  It has a garden-like patio space which also houses a fire place to keep its guests warm during some of the chilly Arizona nights.  The restaurant serves a mixture of Euro and Asian cuisine with obvious French preparation techniques.  With all the influence, I guess that's why it's labeled \"American\", because it's a melting pot.   The menu changes every season based on availability of fresh ingredients.  Supplement your meal with a wide selection of wine.   During our visit in the summer, they had an Ahi-Tuna, its wrapped in bacon and dressed in a miso based glazed. This probability will raise some eyebrows at first, until that first bite. The combination works really well.  The tender texture of the Ahi-Tuna complimented the smoky and salty flavor of the bacon.  The miso horseradish glazes is just what the dished needed to bring the flavors together.   Also on the summer menu was the tenderloin, cooked medium rare with a bacon-fig gastrique. The steak was cooked spot on. The bacon-fig gastrique was just a perfect balance of sweet and sour taste, complementing the meat.   All of the ingredient was fresh; the servers are friendly and for the most part knowledgeable of the food.  The price is on the higher side with an average entre costing over $30. However they do serve an amazing lunch menu at a very reasonable price, a perfect spot to enjoy lunch and the AZ sun under the garden patio.  Come out the quaint French influence restaurant and try all their seasonal dishes, you won't be disappointed.  I went back a few times afterwards and was able to get great results.",

In addition to the standard sodas you would find as non-alcoholic refreshments, they have a great iced tea that is made with muddled fresh raspberries.  I had the special for the day which was the salmon burger.  It was quite possibly the best salmon burger I've had.  It was clearly made with fresh salmon, made from scratch, rather than a mass-produced patty found in the freezer section.  The salmon itself was tender, and flavorful.  I also tried some of the fruit and chicken salad, which was equally good, and very refreshing.  The only thing I wasn't too thrilled about was that it seemed like there was no A/C in the restaurant, and that the only cooling system they had were ceiling fans, which makes for a very warn environment, especially in the heat of summer!",

    "text": "One of my favorite intimate restaurants in town. Located in an old house near ASU one would not think of this as a great place for great eats. Good! Don't spread the word because this is the best kept \"secret\" in town. If you decide to go I suggest a spot on the patio, in the winter they have a huge fire pit going and it makes for a very romantic evening. Just be aware that you may find a small cat curled up in chair upon arrival as House of Tricks has a couple resident patio cats. This suits me just fine as I am a cat lover but if you are not amused by meows prompting you to share the butter or bits of your meal and accept head bumps and curls around your ankles as thanks I would suggest sitting inside because the little black fellow I have run into on several occasions thinks its his job is to taste your meal to ensure it is up to standards. If you are like me and think this sounds adorable then enjoy the patio with the gorgeous old trees and carefully tended garden, it is utterly magical and the company is cute and furry. The ambiance is enough reason for me to go back over and over, but the food is to die for!   The menu is very seasonal with many of the specials coming from what is found in the local markets that day so there is always something new to discover! A staple that never disappoints for me is the lamb. Always cooked spot on, tender and delicious, and a generous enough portion for me that the cat got a whole chop! If the foie gras appetizer is on the menu I would implore you to try it, absolutely divine! Rich, creamy and utterly luxurious! Don't know what to try? The friendly servers are never shy to offer up an opinion and they rarely miss the mark on suggestions. Overall this is a wonderful restaurant that has a quirky, sweet charm about it. It serves 5 star cuisine without the 5 star snottiness that is often found in many valley restaurants. If you are looking for an alternative to the stuffy, chic new restaurants that seem to abound in Phoenix and want an intimate dining experience that is top notch this is your place.",

I'd inadvertently left without signing my receipt or taking my credit card. When I went back the next day to sign and leave a tip, I was told that gratuity had already been included. This is CREDIT CARD FRAUD according to what my credit card company said regarding the incident. I asked to speak to the management on several occasions and was unable to reach anyone or receive a reply.  I've been coming to House of Tricks since they first opened, and had always enjoyed the experience. Sure, they had some rough patches when their head chef left, and after a year or so, things gradually appeared to settle back into a groove. While the food doesn't compare to what it was, it's now pretty decent.  This current staff however, is rough and untrained. But the old staff, including bartenders, aren't what they used to be either. When this happens, I look to management.    Everything trickles down from the top, and Robin, if you expect your team to be top notch, maybe it's time to look at the top. I'm not happy with how I was treated and many of my friends, including myself, haven't been back to your restaurant since.",

Knowing they have a small lot in back we tried there, but it was, of course, full.  I double parked, went in and told the hostess our problem.  She apologized and found the Manager, Ryan Brown, who spent the next fifteen minutes or so looking for a spot for us and finally moving his own personal vehicle so we could use his.  He also provided us with a complimentary appetizer for our trouble.  This is the kind of response that went above and beyond what I had hoped for and is why we will continue to return.",

And with such a nice cozy patio it makes this place one of the best places to go for brunch on the weekends. I look forward to trying more of their dishes but these are some of their must haves when you go:  Salmon Burger. It's a burger special they are currently running. Get as much of it while you can. It's amazing!  Pb&J - The best rendition of pb&j I have ever had in my entire life. This is not an exaggeration, trust me. When you first read that its pistacio butter with cheese, fennel and strawberries, you kind of wonder if that would even taste good together. But when you finally man up and order it, it will change your whole life!  Salman salad with risoto cake - If you are looking for a lighter fare dish, this is a great choice. Perfectly cooked Salmon tossed in a chipotle/grapefruit vinnegrette...Yum!",

    "text": "I was so happy with my experience here.  After spending a few days in AZ and having a bit of culture shock, it was nice to find this quaint little renovated house with a gorgeous outdoor patio area.  There were lush trees and plants everywhere, and even a few kitties that might live there?  My boyfriend and I even decided to brave the 100 degrees to sit out on the patio (we later agreed that it was just a few degrees to warm for that, but it was ALMOST bearable).  We thought about ordering from the happy hour menu, but that is only available at the bar, and we weren't super tempted by anything on the HH menu so decided to delay that for another day and just order off the dinner menu.  We started off with a smoked salmon bruschetta - it was delicious.  I decided to order the lamp chops with lavender potatoes (How could I resist lavender potatoes?).  My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon.  Oh my GOD.  So good.  I also had an Oregon pinot gris that made me very happy.  This was amazing food in an awesome atmosphere!  My only complaints about this experience were:  there were LOTS of flies buzzing around.  I don't really know what could be done about this - we were sitting outside, after all.  Maybe the restaurant could have some discreetly placed fly-catchers ( is that a thing?) around?  I don't know if that is even possible.  I understand that flies are a hazard of sitting outside, so I don't really fault the restaurant for them.  But there were seriously lots of them.  The other slight issue I had was that my boyfriend and I arrived very early in the evening - and we had a reservation.  There was maybe one table seated on the patio, with all the other tables open.  They sat us right away, but it was at a table RIGHT next to the service door.  Meanwhile there are all of these other tables just sitting empty all over the place, and we are trying to have a romantic dinner with people constantly walking in and out of the door right next to my chair.  I just thought it was a weird place to seat us since the place was virtually empty.  These two slight issues were not enough to take away from the overall experience, particularly the amazing food.  I would suggest House of Tricks for a special occasion dinner, and I will also definitely be back to try the happy hour.  This place is a gem!",

    "text": "This place was surprisingly nice.  We came during the Superbowl and found this place while searching for good places to eat. When we arrived at the restaurant, they told us that they were booked out for their inside seating. That was a bummer because it was raining and cold that day, but we figured we'd try outdoor seating anyway. That turned out to be alright because they had heat lamps above each table. We could barely tell we were outside except for the occasional breeze.  One of the biggest things I enjoyed about the place was that it cared for several stray cats. They were super friendly, cute, well maintained, and would adorably beg for food right beside your table. It's impossible not to feed them. They were a welcome distraction.  The food itself was very high end, high quality fare. We started with the wild boar, which was as good as good as the best boar I've had in Seattle. Great flavor, great texture. As for an entree, I had the lamb, which I was skeptical to order. I haven't been to a place that's served good lamb in many years, which is a shame because I love lamb. This place NAILED it. It was tender, flavorful, and on a long bone so I could eat it without having to use utensils (which was probably improper, but whatever haha).  I wanted to try dessert, but was too full. I didn't feel like the meals were all that large, but still managed to fill me up, so that was great. I'd definitely go here again for a special occasion. It's a little pricey for day to day visits.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Props to the owners of this establishment for putting and keeping casual fine dining so close to Mill.  Huge patio, perfect when the weather is nice or on a warm (not hot) summer night.  Quaint atmosphere holds up well to the old home that houses the restaurant.  Soft spot in my heart for this place since it was the first fine dining meal I had in Arizona and it was free since my friends paid for me.  The only real complaints I've had about this place have been uneven service on a couple occasions, and unfortunate seating.  Neither of which overcomes the quality of the food, has been very good.  The service, I've yet to see steady improvement.  The seating, sometimes hard to fix when the place is crowded.  Case in point - came here with my and my family for lunch.  It was packed, had to wait even with a reservation, then was seated on the patio under a tree.  It was nice, it was shaded, but every stiff breeze blew leaves and little flowers into our food and drink.  Couldn't move because the place was so busy.  Lesson learned I guess.  The food is international contemporary.  I appreciate that they use ingredients and techniques form different world cuisines to change things up a bit.  On this last trip we ordered:  Garlicky Caesar salad with chicken breast French dip Asian pork tenderloin \"Banh Mi\" Trout with roasted mushroom brown rice  The Caesar was indeed garlicky and quite good, though the chicken breast (which was pretty big), was sliced into three large pieces and just placed on top.  A little cumbersome to work through, and a little overcooked, but the salad as a whole was good.  The French dip was perhaps the weakest dish.  Nothing wrong with any of it, just that nothing stood out about it - the au jus was a little bland as was the meat, but it was cooked fine.  The \"Banh Mi\" should be reviewed for what it is -  a banh mi in quotation marks.  It had most of the constituent parts of a banh mi with some exceptions (light on cilantro, no pickled daikon), but it tasted decidedly Western.  The Asian-style sauce they put into it didn't help.  But the meat was tender, with lots of it, and the bread was crispy enough to stand up to the filling.  The trout was the best dish of the lot.  Trout, perfectly cooked and seasoned, served almondine-style, with a great mushroom brown rice pilaf.  Some squash on the side too.  Everything was well-cooked and well-seasoned.  It was light with some heft from the umami-rich rice - we would all get this again.  So, to sum up.  House of Tricks, Tempe institution.  Quite good food, reasonably priced, great atmosphere.",

Two things to note: I eat fast (I have a 2 year old, you learn to eat on the go) and I will be honest I eat a lot.   The portions are not huge but I was satisfied, not overly full. The flavor was out of this world. Very bold, spicy flavors, the Avocado Puree was an excellent touch.  The patio looked very comfortable and romantic, however it is Phoenix, Arizona and summer, you will not see me anywhere that does not have AC. Thankfully the inside was nicely decorated with AC.   The service was very attentive, I did not have to ask for any refills of my drink.   All in all I would certainly bring clients here, or have a nice romantic evening with the husband if I was in the area.",

    "text": "We went to celebrate a special occasion here.  My friend from work had highly recommended it for any type of special dinner, so my husband and I thought we'd try it.  I had passed this place many, many times while attending ASU and I had never one stepped foot in to it, but had always seen a great outdoor dining area always full of people that seemed to be enjoying what we now know is great cuisine!  We arrived for dinner without any reservations on a weekend and were seated within 5 or so minutes.  It was great weather, so we had ideal seating outside on the W side of the seating area.. lots of small faint lighting amongst a dark night, a perfect setting for an intimate dinner (though there were others around us not dining so intimately).    Our server was friendly, prompt, and gave us the full description of menu items, wines, etc.  I had an amazing lamb shank and my husband's game-meat was absolutely flavorful!  Every ingredient and combination seemed like it was well thought out and then executed by skilled cooks in to beautiful dishes that were both exciting and still recognizable.  There was this adorable (and I am certainly not a cat kinda gal) cat that kept brushing up against our legs.. I rubbed her belly a bit and found out she was the restaurant's pet.. kinda silly.. but sweet at the same time.  I recommend this place for great food and a nice, relaxing night atmosphere... I'm sure I will pick this place again for a future romantic affair.",

This inspired us to swing by Saturday night  on a hungry impulse. We could have wept when we saw the aforementioned prawn dish on the appetizer menu. It was better than we remembered. Next we had the Korean BBQ ribs. The portion was quite large and the flavors suprisingly bold and bright. We finished our meal with a house salad and duck.  I love good food. I love House of Tricks. This is a special date night, or freinds coming to town kind of place. The patio dining is romantic and I was impressed that our fellow diners were a multinational bunch. This shows the broad appeal of the delicious food. Our service was very good. This place is a winner and we will definitely return!",

    "text": "This has always been one of my favorite restaurants.  Not sure if it is going downhill or just an off day.    4 of us were there for lunch.  Somehow my order, hamburger, got lost.  Not a big deal, it happens.  But it took forever to get it once they found out it was missing in action.  I had ordered it Med. Rare and to add onions, pickle and mustard.  When it finally got there, no mustard pickle or onion and it was extremely well done.  They went to get the stuff but again took a long time and by the time it got there, the burger was cold. In addition to being well done, cold it was totally flavorless.  I was not rude about it but did let them know.  When the check came I figured they would at least give me a discount if not charge me for the burger but  the bill included everything.  Worst of all, the girls ordered a glass of wine which ended up being $10.50 / glass.  Totally outrageous.  But, I guess shame on us for not asking.    Once I got my burger we never saw the server again.  Needed refills on tea and water and literally jumped up and down waving to get their attention to bring the check.  She may have just been too embarrassed to come by.    In addition my sister ordered the daily special, enchiladas of some kind that were also terrible.  Ugly presentation of 2 dried out enchiladas next to a dried out bowl of beans.    To top if off their system would not take my credit card which is a Coin.  I do occasionally run into very small businesses with low tech POS that can't take it but I would have thought they would be ahead of the curve on that stuff.",

The prices are a little expensive but for special occasions I really don't mind. The customer service and staff are wonderful! The appetizer (cheese, meat, olive tray), desert, and wine were fantastic. The desert was a Madagascar Vanilla bean cheesecake on a salted caramel type crust with a raspberry sauce drizzle. It was absolutely amazing. I could have eaten it for dinner.  The main menu is very eclectic (if that is the right word). If you are a picky eater, this is not your place. But if you like food that is off the beaten path or want to take out of town guests for a different experience, this is your place. I had the Mahi Mahi and it was different but good. They like to under cook the food so be careful. I had to send my fish back. My friend ordered a Medium well tenderloin and it was definitely Medium Rare, almost rare. I would've liked it, but still not cooked to medium well. My other co-workers ordered the Autumn Gnocchi (she loved it) and the Cornish game hens (she loved it). Those menu items don't sound all that eclectic but it is the preparation and other foods that accompany the main course that may leave people saying 'hmmmm, I don't know'.That is what I did. My overall experience was great! I recommend it and will return with friends.",

Drinks - I ordered the Peach Basil Martini - delicious and creative.  My husband got the Salty Old Fashioned which is made with Fig and Vanilla Infused Bourbon.  They were both delicious.    Entrees - I got the Togarashi Seared Ahi Tuna.  I was in love with my food.  It was delicious.  My husband got the Burgandy Braised Short Ribs, also delicious and so tender.  Portion sizes were great - not so much food that you felt you would waste and not too little either.    Dessert - Our waiter suggested the Salted Caramel-Apple Bread Pudding with Cinnamon Whipped Cream.  A perfect ending to a perfect meal.",

It made for a very lovely evening! The wine selections were fair, although I think they could invest in carrying a different selection of pinot grigio and chardonnay. The whites were a bit lacking, and I'm not a huge reds fan. I wish I could give this place a 4.5 stars rather than 4! I think what would make it a 5 for me would be to add to the wine selection! We will most definitely be back! Cheers!",

Plenty of heaters if there is a chill, but we were quite comfortable this night without them.  We came at height of dinner hour on a Saturday.  Our server was helpful but a little distracted.  She had tables all over the restaurant and was slammed.  She made up for her lack of attention with her knowledge of the menu and solid, accurate recommendations.  Menu was not overly large and full of tempting fare.  We stayed in the Starters and Soup/Salad section to maximize variety.  Wow.  Warm shaved brussel sprouts with macadamias and blue cheese (like nothing else I've had in the recent brussel sprouts menu item boom), thin sliced wild boar BBQ, a toasted garbanzo bean plate and a smoked foie gras plate - all packed with flavor and well-presented.  Desserts were a moon pie special with caramelized bananas and the best bread pudding I've had since Commanders Palace in NO.  The portions on the starters were generous without overwhelming and we had room for the fantastic desserts.  Decent selection of wines by the glass and what looked like some interesting cocktails - we stuck to the wine.  Tempe seemed like a great college town with a fun, slightly rowdy vibe.  It also appeared to have a great restaurant scene.  We'll have to stay longer next time.",

The only dish I've had that was on the disappointing side was the black bean burger, which was just too dry.",

    "text": "This restaurant probably has the best location and layout of any restaurant in the valley.  It's a hidden gem that I think gets looked over too easily, but honestly I like it that way.  The crowd here is older, not sure why but you never seen college kids here which is strange.    Concerning the fair, the food is really good but not great however, it's better than most but in Tempe that's not saying a lot.  The menu isn't very extensive though so that really subtracts from its appeal.  Lastly the service, the service here is wonderful, the staff are just so nice and attentive.  However, it must be said that they are not very expedient, be prepared to wait not for the food to come but for you server to come.  All in all this place ties for best restaurant in Tempe with its neighbor the Chop Shop.",

    "text": "Went to House of Tricks last night with two friends. First I gotta say Jackie, our waitress, was super helpful and extremely knowledgeable about the menu. For drinks, That Green Thing was amazing, I highly recommend it, also good was The Dirty Bird (both gin and vodka versions).   Now to the food, we got the PEI mussels, Wild Boar & Koran Ribs to start, my favorite was the Wild Boar but all were extremely favorable and prepared perfectly.   Next course was salads, the Brussel sprout salad with beets, soft egg and pancetta vingerette was the clear winner for the table, also good was the arugula salad with pine nut and Fig Champagne vingerette.  For the entrees the table spilt the Molasses Braised Pork Osso Buco with Shaved Gruyere, Snap Peas and Toasted White Beans, the pork was fork tender and packed with flavor I would highly recommended this.   My favorite was the Sumac Crusted Lamb Rack on Apple-Cauliflower Puree with Amarena Cherry-Whisky Sauce and Wilted Kale, the lamb was a beautiful medium rare and the Whisky sauce was incredible.  The salted caramel apple dessert is a staff favorite and we totally agreed!!  Wish I was in town longer so that I could go back :)",

We started off with some champagne and then switched to red wine. They have an extensive wine selection, and the Cabernet we ordered was absolutely delicious and smooth. We tried the heirloom tomato salad, ahi tuna, foie gras, and there was a special of duck. The duck was by far the best dish we tried, but all of them were flavorful and delectable. Though the place is a bit pricey, it was a delightful special occasion out with the girls. The service was also great.",

While the scallop were prepared nicely, the dish just looked like a mess and wasn't worth the price IMO for 3 smallish scallops.  Overall, my meal did not meet expectations based on other reviews.",

This is good food, done creatively, and in my mind presented in a casual yet sophisticated manner without any pretensiousness. The chef here creates inspirational dishes that seem to meld asian and southwestern flavors seemlessly. Ok so now I realize this are not all real words but after eating here and developing a drunken state of mind who really cares anyhow?  The lowdown is the food is good and priced fair for what you get. Our service was great and on top of everything we truly had an amazing time on a rainy Saturday evening. Next time hopefully we can enjoy the killer outdoor bar and patio seating. I cant wait to go back and eat our way through the new menu.  The custom cocktails were delightful and the wine list is pretty spot on.",

I have been to great restaurants all over the world and could not understand why they had just one guy working a very busy area. There were people all around the bar ordering food and drinks and those of us who were at the high top tables as well. The other staff continued to walk by and head to their respective areas of service. We waited for a while for him to come back after giving us the drink menus. We did not eat until about 7:45 pm, which is unacceptable!!! I have a busy life and was not expecting to have to wait all night for a meal after a long day of work!!!!!  My guy friend that I was with who loves this place, reassured me that it is not always like this, but I am still annoyed.  THe food on the other hand was awesome and my bourbon infused drink left me feeling pretty nice, since, I obviously had an empty stomach!  Not sure if I would go back...",

Now let's get to the good part..the FOOD :)  We had a ton of appetizers - shrimp, chicken and veggies and all were really good.

There are misters for those who like eating outside.  Since I've only been here once, and I had to eat at the bar area for happy hour, I don't know what the noise level is indoors, but it certainly seems nice in there, if not a bit cramped.  A big minus for me is that smoking is allowed outside, so I'm hoping to secure a table indoors on my next visit.  Ordered the only cocktail on the menu that uses ginger liqueur (sorry, but I forgot the name), and really liked it!  It tasted light and refreshing, but packed quite a punch, so be careful-- it went down very smoothly and very fast!  Happy hour knocked off only $1, down to $9, so I suppose it's good that the bartender had a heavy hand.  ;)  As for my entree, I had the Roasted poblano, artichoke, and spinach dip, which came w/ both crostini and water crackers.  Skip the water crackers (they felt stale when I bit into them, and they're very bland) and stick w/ the crispy, nicely-toasted, and olive oil-drizzled crostini.  I did, and I ate the entire thing!  (Well, minus the water crackers.)  The base was very creamy, yet also chunky (I love foods that layer on many textures!), and I really appreciated the heat that the roasted poblanos brought to this dish.  From the moment I took that first bite, I thought that  this dish was different from any other spinach and artichoke dips I've ever tried.  Try it if you're into s/a dips, and let me know what you think of this one!  The rest of the menu sounds great, but can get very pricey (salads and soups, $6-10; starters, $10-19; and entrees, $20-32).  Will try to return for lunch!",

Parking is not a problem but you have to pay for it, no big deal. The food is great. I particularly love their appetizers and especially the rabbit terrine/pate. Their mussels are delightful. I do order a few appetizers instead of a main dish because I enjoy trying different and smaller portions of food. They are closed in July due to the high heat of our summers but as soon as they reopen we will be getting there again for dinner.",

    "text": "I finally got to dine at House of Tricks a few days ago for my birthday dinner (thanks, husband!). Despite being on the ASU campus, the restaurant's historic house-turned-eatery works well and the charming outdoor patio with plenty of deciduous shade made you feel like you were enjoying your meal someplace much more upscale, i.e. not ASU!   Our server was really friendly -- always a plus, but at a place as expensive as House of Tricks, that should be expected. (Disclaimer: normally, husband and I eat vegan/vegetarian, but elected to be carnivores for our dinner. At the time of this review, there was only 1 vegetarian entree on the menu.)  We started with the ahi tuna poke with avocado cream and \"lime-scented\" cucumbers. That was really good and gone far, far too quickly. The husband ordered the lamb shank and lemon-honey risotto (the lamb was falling off of the bone, very yummy) and I had the bison meatloaf and purple sweet potato puree (also very good). For dessert, we shared the apple bread pudding and barely finished it.   Although we waited longer than expected to place our drink orders (a good 10 minutes...maybe I'm impatient?), overall, service was good. Presentation was lovely and the intentionally mismatched china bread plates are quaint and charming.  I would definitely come here again for a special occasion!",

We went for the Valentine's Dinner menu and it was absolutely perfect. We started off with drinks and my favorite was the toasted. It had caramel whiskey, Frangelico, banana liquor, cream and cinnamon! Such a refreshing and sweet drink to start off the night. We split most of the courses except our entrees.   The lobster bisque was amazing especially with the mix of chorizo oil. The Gnocchi had an amazing blend of flavors and the presentation was beautiful. The best thing was the Bourbon Peach glazed prime rib. Seriously, I took some home so I could enjoy it one more day. We finished off with the Dark chocolate cake that had earl grey whipped cram and berry compote. The delectable garnish on top was beautiful and helped to wrap up the whole meal.  My suggestion is to go during their special events since they have different items on the menu. I still dream about that prime rib, the best I ever had! I wish it was always on the menu.",

This is possibly the worst service I have experienced at a restaurant. It took 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by the staff and subsequently 30 more minutes to get even a drink.  The waiter's answer to the bad service was simply, I am behind and just catching up.  Ok fine but no apology, no management anywhere to be seen.  Just an excuse. This restaurant is very expensive so to be treated like that was unacceptable. On to the food.  They try very hard to be different, so different that some of the dishes made no sense.  I had the rare tuna with egg noodles in a sauce that was so spicy (not flavorful spicy) that it was nearly inedible.  It was also lukewarm.   This place is definitely not worth the price and service was so lacking it was ridiculous.",

Our meals (6 oz steak and Texas wild boar enchiladas) were excellent, as were the beef enchilada soup and shaved Brussels sprout and beet salad, which we shared. We passed on dessert due to being full from our meals, but several of them sounded yummy when our server described them. My only disappointment was the noise level; it was quite noisy in the small room we were in, but that was due to some large groups of diners enjoying Holiday party cheer. It's not been a problem other times we've dined there. Highly recommended for events you want to be memorable!",

Very diverse and affordable wine list. We had an excellent Napa sparkling wine that was festive and nicely complemented the appetizers. Our mains included squid ink pasta, which was off the small plates menu but was a very generous portion, the bison steak, the game hen, and a squash gnocchi. Everything was exceptional except for the squash gnocchi, which was disappointingly bland. It is does not pay to be vegetarian in the West. Great service, wonderful patio, and a beautiful night. We planned our meal with my son and girlfriend after the ASU game had started, and the restaurant was wonderfully calm and only about half full.

She was very accommodating, as we were sort of crunched for time. I took ages to finally decide on what I wanted and I decided on the Daily Burger Special, which was a green chile tuna burger with pomegranate guacamole (YES, I KNOW!). It was SO delicious. My friend ordered the chicken taco salad and her mom got the shwarma salad. We ordered the tapas plate as an appetizer, which was also delicious and light. My meal was $13, so very reasonably priced for the quality of food I got.  I'll be back again soon.",

House of Tricks has a regular lunch menu, and on Saturdays, they offer a brunch menu.  Each of us ordered something different, and we all enjoyed what we had.  One lady had the eggs benedict, another the shrimp and grits and I had grilled salmon salad, which was absolutely the best salmon salad I have ever had.  Even though I live in Glendale, I would definitely drive back to House of Tricks for the salmon salad.    Yesterday's weather was perfect for outdoor dining.  We enjoyed the relaxed, comfortable atmosphere.    The only negative is parking.  There is limited parking on the street, but across the street is a big sign \"Public Parking\".  Do not park there!  The entrance was completely open with no mention of having to pay for parking.  You can imagine our surprise when we went to our car and saw a traffic ticket on the windshield.  We walked around the parking lot to see where we might have missed a sign indicating we have to pay for parking, and we found something clear on the other side of the parking lot, definitely not in sight of where we drove in.",

Hostess being very young for the job and not having the appropriate communication skills, maturity, and dress. Granted, this is a college town. However, if I was the owner, first impressions matter. You want someone mature,knowledgeable and dress more classy than casual attire. We waited at the bar and found the bartender staff very nice, professional, and extremely helpful.  We were not charged for our drinks after I expressed my discontent to the bartender staff. They were great communicating this to the restaurant staff. Our waiter was great. However, the food quality does not meet the price they are charging. It's way overpriced. I had the beef tenderloin with a bacon reduced sauce. It was way to salty and the beef had a line of tough connective tissue in the middle. Not prime meat!! Seen better at Costco.  The bathroom floor was slightly wet and looked dirty. The exhaust vent had loads of dust. Overall, this restaurant claims to be slightly upscale and prices its dishes as such. It misses the mark in many small ways. If I was the owner, I would review hostess job, clean the bathrooms, food quality needs to be examined better when coming from kitchen. I doubt prices will change. It's a nice location. It just needs a little better attention to details. I probably won't go back again. Their are other restaurants with better quality.",

    "text": "Tricks just keeps getting better and better. I have gone here frequently over the years and our last three visits have been wonderful.  The most recent, on a spectacular Saturday afternoon at about 2:30, the lovely and I sauntered over to Tricks, were placed at a table in front of the bar area and proceeded to have one of the loveliest meals in a long time.   It was the lunch menu and I had a sandwich of grilled chicken, goat cheese, fig jam and greens served on ciabatta. Jeff had Chili Rubbed Hanger Steak and Asadero Cheese Stuffed Tortillas with Roasted Ancho Guajillo Sauce, Avocado Puree and Cilantro Rice [...pulled that off the menu...] Both so amazingly good alongside a Terlato Pinot Gris!   We followed that up with dessert. We shared two different chocolate treats - one a flourless fortress with sugared pistachios and macerated figs, the other a 'smore's brownie'. The first was delightful by any measure but we were both smitten by the brownie. Buttered graham crackery delishushness under a smooth chocolate and toasted marshmallow that was not at all unctuous but a TOTAL delight of chocolate sweet, buttery salty yum. We were so full but we managed to choke it all down!   Top that all off with a charming waiter with wonderful ease and recommendations and some very fine coffee. We loved every minute. We rarely say 'perfect' about our dining experiences and on this afternoon, we did. It was perfect. Thank you Tricks.",

    "text": "I loved the setting. HOT is located on a fairly busy street, but you would never know it sitting on the patio surrounded by trees. Free parking is available at the meters after 6 pm Monday through Saturday.   They have a lot of outdoor seating, I actually didn't take a peek inside other than to wash my hands before dinner. The space on the wooden patio outside is cozy (that means that some of tables are pretty close together). We sat right next to the fireplace, but they also have plenty of heat lamps to keep you warm on a chilly night. And the tables are pretty small to keep everything on them (2 water glasses, 2 wine glasses, candle, 2 bread plates, 2 dinner plates, utensils, salt and pepper, flower vase, bread basket, butter). We had to move some stuff to the top edge of the fireplace.   We were still pretty stuffed from our heavy lunch so we passed on starters and decided to munch on bread and order dinner. The bread was pretty good, but the lemon poppy butter (it changes every night) was amazing. It was so light, sweet and tangy. We expected to get more of it when we asked for more bread and butter, but they just brought out plain butter. Our waitress said they had only make so much because it changes every night, so you have to ask specifically for it their special butter of the night if you want more. Weird that they were already out since it was maybe 7:30 pm.   For dinner I had the ballotine of chicken stuffed with brioche foie gras stuffing (you get 3 pieces), cognac demi glace, sauteed spinach and butternut squash puree. It was heaven. And all went together perfectly. Mike had the beef tenderloin on horseradish whipped potatoes, sauteed spinach, bacon onion jam and red wine demi glace. Although he ordered it medium it came out almost well done. It was kind of hard to immediately tell the donenss when he cut into the steak (other than the texture) because it is pretty dark outside. The wait staff really should have a small flashlight and wait for you to cut into it so you can tell.  However, they quickly apologized for the mistake and promptly brought out a new plate. Mike said the meat wasn't very flavorful.   This place can be pretty pricey. For just 2 dinners and 2 glasses of wine, plus tax and tip our bill came out to be just over $90. The atmosphere was nice and the food was good, but I thought it was just a bit overpriced. Heard that lunch is a better deal so I'll have to come back for that.",

    "text": "We made reservations over a week ahead, and the hostess told use that their was not room inside were we had request in our online reservations. She then told us in a snotty way, that reservations are not guaranteed, and one of the houses were closed for some reason. Just full of excuses. I told the Hostess that it did not say that reservations were not guaranteed   The hostess gave us a table outside, next to the sidewalk, and it was very noisy and cold.   We ordered drinks when the waiter finally came to our table, and the waiter returned with drinks, and some bread that was cold, and not cut all the way, and no bread knife to cut it. we then ordered a starter, and our entrees, before he could leave.  The food was served on time, but not by our waiter, and we still had a table filled with empty starter plates,that should have been removed by our waiter before service on the main course, and again it was the the busboy that served us.  The food was good, and still hot. The waiter showed up a little later and asked how the food was, but did not return to clear our dirty plates, or in the mean time, ask us if we would like refills on our drinks, but the busboy did instead.  The server was a poor server to say the least, and the server could not handle a few tables. We noticed that the other waiter for the tables around us, was very attentive to his tables, and had more tables to take care of.  For the price of the the service and host, were very poor, and brought the restaurant down. I would not rate the, House Of Tricks even a 3 star, 2 1/2 at the most. Food 3. but not at all more the that.  Do not be Tricked into having a romantic dinner indoors at the House Of Tricks, because they will trick you into thinking that.  The house it self was too small for service, and the staff did not care to make things right. We sat in the cold, and it was not romantic at all !  We made a reservation for indoors, over a week in advance, and your hostess, was rude, and told use that reservations were not guaranteed. I told her that it did not say that when we made the reservation, so what is the point in making a reservation, and special request for a table then ! ?  The food was the only good thing !  Thank you for ruining our,10 year anniversary dinner !  Server was untrained, and very poor service.",

That's what my wife and I did last night, by the fire (TWSS). If you're into sitting at the bar, there's none better (when it's cool) and their wine selection is outstanding.  We shared: Fried Fromage Dauphinoise with Homemade Strawberry Preserves, Arugula and Grilled Ciabatta (intimidating name, right?). Think chewy bread with warm brie and strawberry jam. Yeah. Good.  She had: Vegetarian Fall Harvest Lasagna with Four Cheeses, San Marzano Tomatoes and Sage Bechamel. I just had a couple bites (and the mushroom), but her lasagna was fantastic; not mushy-eggplanty like a lot of veggie lasagnes.  I had: Roasted Baby Beets with Humboldt Fog Goat Cheese, Toasted Almond Pesto and Verjus Vinaigrette. It was fantastic and filling, with a large portion of cheese. Beets are so trendy right now and it'd hard to prepare them poorly, but these were exceptional.   We shared: Flourless chocolate cake with salted caramel something. Tasted exactly like it sounds. Rich and tasty and sweet and salty and good with coffee.",

Cute, nice, and comfy atmosphere (outdoor dining was GREAT), but service was painfully slow, super polite on the surface but the actual level of service, especially the attentiveness, was average at best. Food was hit and miss, too...Here is our group's collective review/impression. Special (fish) and Braised pork belly was way too salty, and the coffee flavored creme brulee was more like a sugar-loaded pudding with a thick crust of sugar on top. Special dessert (some cake with nuts?) was great. Foie Gras was OK. Lamb and steak were good. I may come back but not with the excitement that we had prior to this dining experience. Not for special occasions for sure...",

Seeing the patio, I thought, \"oh, this is really cute.\"  Once seated inside, I thought, \"oh, this is really cute.\"  Seeing the prices on the dinner menu, I thought, \"oh, this better be really good.\"  Long story short, it was okay.  My friend, who had only been here for lunch, apologized for the unexpectedly high prices.  I didn't care too much, I guess.  It was edible.  I'd probably come back for lunch.  Which I did, with co-workers in tow.  The prices at noon were certainly more agreeable and we all looked forward to a pleasant meal.  Suddenly, this gem of an exchange occurred between our waiter and my boss, Debbi:  Debbi:  How large is the quiche?  I weigh 230 pounds, so I'm a big girl.  We giggled.  Debbi loves to joke.  Waiter:  Well, it's not as big as you.  Bad form, dude.  Bad form.  You're lucky we paid lunch menu prices.",

This restaurant is an oasis of fine dining in a darling house and yard tucked away on a side street amid the ASU hubbub of activity. The service (I think Sarah was the name of our server) was terrific and the food was absolutely delicious. We never felt rushed and we were able to relax and enjoy the meal with plenty of time to walk to the theatre afterward. I had the Frenched chicken, which was served with couscous and vegetables - a delightful combination of textures and flavors. My husband had the osso buco, which he said was delicious and perfectly done. We have dined here on many occasions over the years and have always had a lovely experience.",

    "text": "Wish I could give a lower rating than 1 star because FOOD POISONING should be negative stars since I was forced to lose my entire dinner.    First off, we saved our first experience for the house of tricks for a special occasion.  My 25th birthday: a reason to celebrate.  Little did I know that the appetizer of PEI mussels would grant me the birthday gift of hunching over the toilet for the rest of the night.    We ordered another appetizer as well.  The soup of the day.  it was explained to me as a roasted butternut squash soup.  However, when we got it, it was full of Indian curry flavors and topped with feta cheese.  No one ever said that it would be Indian squash soup.  We found the curry taste to be so overpowering that  we ended up sending it back (we had Indian for lunch and were not in the mood for more).  The server was gracious and said she would take care of it but, as the bowl made its way back into the kitchen, we could HEAR the loud kitchen crew complaining that we didn't \"know what good curry tastes like!\"  Well i may not make my own garam masala from scratch but I DO know that i was never told that there would be curry in my soup and I ALSO KNOW that Indian food it NEVER topped with GREEK cheese!  Fools.  But the meal ventures on.  Entrees.  We ordered the lychee marinated duck breast and the \"Everything  Spiced Ahi tuna\".  The duck tasted NOTHING of lychee.  it tasted of star anise, clove, ginger, and plum sauce.  Very similar to the taste of pho (Vietnamese noodle soup).  in fact, it tasted almost identical without the soup.  If I wanted pho, i would go down the street and get it for $7, NOT get dressed up and pay $25 for a dried excuse for a pho-flavored duck breast.  Sad.  The \"everything\" spiced ahi tasted as if it should have been named the \"Nothing Spiced Ahi Tuna\".  Bland bland bland.  the couscous accompaniment tasted like nothing.  the sliver of sabayon given to lend flavor was barely adequate to make up for the overwhelming blandness.  it was bland in the way that silence can be deafening.  This \"rollercoaster\" of flavor costs $27.  Sad.   We ordered dessert in an attempt to make SOMETHING of the mere memorable.  We were poorly mistaken.  Blackberry cobbler.  we got a single casserole dish with warm blackberry jam and half a biscuit baked on top.  Small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Only good part was the ice cream but, then again...  can't mess up store bought ice cream now can you?  All in all: a $130 disaster.  top it all off with food poisoning and I think you have the worst restaurant experience ever.  The only saving grace was the server, who was sweet and responsive.  The kitchen was full of LOUD retards who think they know how to cook.  The food was even sadder for us because the empty-promised great-hype and were saving H.O.T. for a special occasion.  With so much hype and the menu's promise of greatness, the harsh reality of sub-par execution left us somber and bewildered.  Dumbstruck.  Then...  nauseous.    Side note:  this menu isn't even seasonal.  We went in May; it is now September and...  SAME MENU!  NASTY.",

I have to agree with several other reviewers in noticing that the food here is nothing spectacular. If anything, it's formulaicly spiked with keyword cache ingredients, and executed in a wholly unremarkable manner. And it's damn pricey.  I'm Ok with smaller portions when the food has been exquisitely fussed over, or when it's innovative and extraordinary--but when it's just \"good\", I feel like that's one trick they can keep under their hat(s).  They do have an impressive wine list, and the staff has a refreshingly classy attitude overall, but snob appeal is really only good for showing off- and not enjoying yourself consistently.  I guess that's why it's good for first dates or out-of-town guests, but too expensive and impersonal to be considered a favorite.",

I'm certainly glad I called ahead because the place was jam-packed when we got there.  We were given the options of being seated inside now, or outside shortly.  We opted for the latter to enjoy the beautiful night air.  The restaurant bar that we waited at was surprisingly crowded too.  I don't know if they were short-staffed that night, but, the fact that it took almost ten minutes to get the bartenders attention was just and indication of the way the night was going to go.  While the drinks (my manhattan and her mojito) were quite good, they were also quite pricey.  Far more than I thought they were worth.  Whatever, right?  It's for Valentines Day.  Well, that just kind of kept going.  My ribeye was.....fine.  Pretty tasty but....well, maybe I'm just not a fan of ribeye.  The soup, a cauliflower-chorizo blend, was good.  Again, just not worth what we ended up paying for it.  Happily, my girlfriend really enjoyed her foie gras stuffed chicken, at least.  All in all, good, but as a dining event, not worth the $100-ish dollars.  The service is pretty good and the location and ambiance can't be beat.  I'll give it another try, but there is quite a queue of places for me to check first before I rush back.",

A group of friends and I sat at the bar and had good service, great wine (they have a very eclectic wine list) and the food was AMAZING!!!  Although the bar is a totally cool place to sit, the next time I want to sit on a patio, I'm heading here!  Great job!",

    "text": "I was here recently for lunch and it reminded me of a less pretentious Arcadia Farms.  I love Arcadia Farms except for all the pretension, so this was great!  Also, House of Tricks' lunch menu seems to have more variety, slightly lower prices, and a really cute bar outside on the deck.     Loads of menu items sounded appealing to me but I finally settled on the Moroccan Fruit and Chicken Shawarma Salad.  I like all the individual ingredients in it, but once I started eating it I thought, \"What's the concept here?\"  Salad greens, fruit salad (lots- not just random pieces of fruit mixed in), and a shawarma-seasoned chicken breast on top.  Plus pine nuts, cous cous, and some other stuff mixed in!  Not bad; just...random.  I also tasted the mushroom crepes, which were huge and were served in a very rich creamy sauce.  Good for a few bites but I wouldn't want something so heavy as my meal.    I'll definitely come back and try something else, as I really liked the atmosphere and several other menu items sounded interesting.  The one downside is the metered parking -- a quarter only gets you something like 5-10 minutes and there's a maximum of 80 minutes, so you may end up running out to feed the meter before you're ready to leave (or worse: forgetting to do so and getting a ticket).",

Our server seemed distracted, not rude, but not overflowing with charm. She did not check back often, dishes were not cleared in a timely manner, refills were slow in coming. All in all, very disappointing service for the price.  Food was so-so. Our bread was one small piece for each of us, served with a strange sweet/garlic butter that I couldn't finish. Soup of the day was an interesting pork broth, but was over salted. My gnocchi was tough, my son's fish was undercooked, and my husband said his salmon was unremarkable. And the \"Korean\" ribs - we have eaten ribs in Korea, and these were not Korean. It was probably the best dish we were served, but we should know better than to expect \"real\" Korean at a non-Korean place. Plus it took almost an hour to get our food.  All in all a meal that did not meet expectations.",

    "text": "My parents and I had a reservation here to celebrate my birthday, since it's a favorite of ours. We arrived on time but were kept waiting (no one acknowledged us at all) at the counter for about 5 minutes. I kept trying to make eye contact with the servers/hosts but could not seem to get their attention. We were finally seated on the patio, which was very nice and perfect for outdoor dining.  Unfortunately, the service continued to be lacking. We saw our waitress only a few brief times throughout the whole night - once to take our orders, once to give us the dessert menu, and once to collect our money. She was friendly, but the fact remains that she was mostly nowhere to be found.   Despite the mediocre service, the food was great. We shared the mussels for an appetizer, and they were very large and tasty. I ordered the halibut, which was perfectly cooked. My dad got the pork tenderloin, and my mom had the Thai duck, both of which were fantastic as well. The key lime cheesecake we got for dessert was not so good - it had a strange, trying-too-hard-to-be-different tinge to it, and it was drowning in a sea of raspberry sauce. The coffee was lovely though!  All in all, I would go back to (and recommend) House of Tricks because the food has been fairly consistent in quality and its ambiance is a rare find in Phoenix. I do wish the service was better, especially given the prices. A friendly, present, and attentive waitress would have made my birthday night so much better!",

Our favorites include the chicken pasta, pork pastrami, trout and salmon. I now am adding the ahi salad to this list. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy",

    "text": "Great atmosphere and level of service, but I think the food is overrated.  I arrived on a Tuesday night right at 9 pm on my third visit and sat in the bar area.  Being the month of March, you really can't beat the outdoor seating here. It has a great, romantic atmosphere enclosed by plants and trees. If you were blindfolded and brought here, you wouldn't even know you were next to ASU and Mill Ave.  For dinner I ordered the Spring Mix Salad with Tomato, Cucumber, Radish, Goat Cheese and White Balsamic-Honey Vinaigrette and, for the main course, the Housemade Rag Pasta with Veal Breast Bolognese, Pine Nut-Toasted Fennel, Goat Cheese and Golden Raisin Gastrique. Sounds delicious, right?  The salad was okay, but neither the greens nor the vinaigrette stood out. The main flavors that come out were that of the radishes and goat cheese. None of the delicate nuances of the spring mix--hints of pepper, hints of lemon, hints of bitterness, etc.--came out. For the main course, I just thought that the dish was too heavy. Maybe some people really like it, but, for me, it was too nutty and the sauce way too thick and creamy. Almost soupy. Generally, in restaurants of this caliber, I think of the pasta dishes being lighter so that I can enjoy the delicateness of the housemade pasta, i.e., pasta should not be drowning. I'll leave that up to the Olive Garden to bathe the food in random cream sauce to mask the use of substandard pasta and ingredients.  My dining opinion is that the food does not taste as good as it reads. That being said, taking into account the atmosphere and the level of service I received, this is certainly a place worth visiting with a date, friends, family, co-workers, etc. to be able to enjoy conversing and dining outdoors in a relaxed setting.  On a date night, I would dine somewhere else and then come here and sit outside for dessert and drinks.",

House of Tricks is all outdoor seating, so probably not best to come here on a hot 100 degree day (they close down in July). But when the weather is right and you want to enjoy AZ's beautiful outdoors, this is a great place to sit for a while with good company.   I came here the day before Memorial Day with two of my girlfriends. We split 3 appetizers (Mussels in a curry chorizo sauce with bread, fruit and cheese platter, and baby back ribs). We all had a few cocktails, too. I recommend the Pear cocktail (Grey Goose Pear Vodka, champagne - delicious! but one or two of those and you might want a ride home). My friend had the Spring Chicken cocktail (gin, peach schnapps - very refreshing!)  This is the type of place where you can really sit and enjoy your meal and drinks for a couple hours. There are trees surrounding the tables and bar so there's always shade. Even though it's by ASU, you feel really closed off and private.   The Executive Chef here is amazing, as well! We met him last time we were here and had to give him props for everything he makes. He completely changes the menu EVERY SEASON so you'll never get bored of this place. I have never tried anything of his that didn't put me in a blissful food coma.   Keep doing what you're doing, guys! Love everything.",

When I called to make the reservation they asked if it was as special occasion and I told them it was for my birthday.  It turns out my wife called the next day to make sure they knew it was my birthday and they already had it noted in the reservation.  When we arrived at 6:45pm about 3/4 of the tables were full and it stayed about that full until 8pm or so.  The water boy arrived promptly and brought us water.  When the waiter arrived soon after he asked about drinks and we told him we would be ordering a bottle of wine and we needed a few minutes to take a look at the wine list.  We then waited maybe 10-15 minutes for him to come back to see if we were ready to order.   We ordered the wine and meal choices.  The soup arrived maybe 10 minutes later and it was delicious.  But we then waited nearly 45 minutes for the entrees.  My short ribs were dry and my wife's scallops were cold.  My daughter's trout was good and the other diners salad was fine.  Once finished we waited another 15 minutes for the waiter to ask about deserts.  At this point we had been at the restaurant nearly 2 hours.   No mention of the birthday celebration even though we were opening gifts at the table.  We've dined here many times over the years and I take business clients here for lunch several times a year.  We've usually enjoyed ourselves but this evening was a bust.  We've been dining downtown Phoenix a lot more lately and I'd say the competition there is delivering solid 4+ star experiences.  Maybe they just had a bad night bit it was pretty bad for a $200 check for 4 people.",

I told her we were celebrating and would love it if they would accommodate us with an out of the way table - romantic. When we got there we were placed in a small room with 5 other tables. The foursome next to us was so loud we could barely hear each other. Then they sat a 6 top right next to us (2 feet between us and them), one of the women had on a terrible perfume which made my sinuses swell, so we asked to move. It was a Saturday night and they were busy and there were not many empty tables. They placed us at a 2 top next to the bathroom and we finished our dinner with the aroma of sewage. Blah! We were not offered any dessert for our celebration (we did get 2 half glasses of sparkling cider). My husband had the fish of day for $28.00 and he said it was mediocre. I had the chicken for $26.00 and it was ok. I didn't finish it so I took it home to feed my critters. The next day when I was cutting it up, I discovered it was raw inside. The table was not lit well enough for me to see it the night before. Needless to say we spent $87.56 on our meal (food only) and we were very disappointed. We were looking for something special to celebrate and the House of Tricks fell drastically short. We will not return and it was miserable enough that I will pass that information on to everyone. It was a big year anniversary and we can't get it back.",

It will be very hard for me to NOT come and eat them every night of the week! Good job! My only wish is that there were 4 instead of only 2... :)",

    "text": "I've been to Tricks a few times, but only to the bar, where I've had excellent beverages, food, and service.  Dining was a disappointing experience in comparison. I anticipated it to be busy because it was restaurant week and Wicked was playing at Gammage, so I was prepared for the service to be slightly impacted.  We were seated right away because our reservation was set for 6:30.  Upon sitting down, it took about 10 minutes for water to come to the table and for our server to introduce himself and take our drink order.  It took another 20 minutes for him to bring the drinks and take our food order.  While waiting for our drinks to come, we had the unfortunate privilege of an angry customer basically yelling at the manager about the time it took for service and food.  It didn't set the best mood for the night.  Once our server did get our order the food came out pretty fast and as it slowed his service improved but the first hour tainted our experience for the night. I really enjoyed the flavors of the food, but the execution was off.  The foie gras was room temperature, the lamb rack was tough and chewy and the scallops were undercooked.   I also found it odd that the chef refused to allow exceptions on the restaurant week menu.  There was a dumpling I wanted to try and the chef said that only people doing the restaurant week menu would be able to order off of it.  It didn't make sense to me for a couple reasons.  As a customer ordering off the normal menu we were spending more money than the 3 course menu offered during restaurant week and it would've been easy to mark up the cost of the entree in order to accommodate the table.   When it did slow, our server was able to get an exception on getting us a dessert off the restaurant week menu.  I was excited to try the creme brulee with balsamic reduction, but the balsamic was overpowering.  If I go back, I will be sticking to the bar.  For the cost of dining in and the service, it's not worth the money spent.",

We started with drinks,  I had the Lavender Dog, so good.  It was so good others ordered one after they finished their first drink.( Would love to have the recipe).  I ordered the Pork Chop very tender,  full of flavor  and the bitter brussel sprout leaves were a great counter balance to the sweet tart chutney.  One person got the Mahi Mahi,  she loved it.  The other at the table got the Filets and again they all enjoyed it very much.  We ended the night with night caps,  I got the Toasted....excellent.  Thank you House of Tricks for always making meals so wonderful.",

I made a online reservation for Sat night, however upon arrival I found that was not necessary as they were not full.   We started with the Ahi watermelon salad $13. It has 3 small slices of sashimi and 8 blocks of watermelon with some greens and a wasabi glaze. It was good but very very small.  For our mains we had a Potato chip wrapped wild sea bass on a plat of beans and sauce $30. The Fish was bit over cooked and too firm, the beans and sauce lacked much flavor. We also had the Goat Cheese veggie  Lasagna $20, While it did look nice topped with Julianned squash and a nice swoosh of pesto on the plate, it was nothing special.   The bread comes with a sweet butter which is nice.   We had some wine by the glass that was decently priced for the environment.  Overall it was an impressive place for a date however the food did not impress.",

There is some sort of fire place looking empty square in the middle and basic tables and chairs- that's it. Really just blah.

Our reservation for 6 diners at 7 was for the beautiful patio, which we always prefer. They have a fire pit and numerous heaters, so we were comfy on a cool fall evening.   We ordered cocktails, which took some time but they had a full house. Soon after we ordered appetizers and entrees because the apps are so big, three of us had those instead of entrees.   For the table, we had a cheese tray, loaded with six cheeses, fruit and various breads. Two ordered soup. Tonight they served oriental onion and beef broth with crispy rice, cilantro and a heavenly addition of mushrooms. Mine was outstanding. The other who ordered soup tipped the bowl at the end so as not to miss any!    One of us had the pecan smoked salmon (app as an entree), two had the Harissa spiced mussels (app as an entree) while the guys had halibut, rag pasta with veal and ahi tuna.   Nothing but yummy sounds from the girls with the apps as entrees and the halibut entree. I ordered the ahi tuna but also tasted the veal. The tuna was seared perfectly and had a flavorful soy broth to dip into. The veal pasta was excellent as well.   We were visited by the two house cats during dinner. They weren't looking for handouts. Just wanted to say hi!  Service: excellent Menu selection: excellent Food: excellent Prices: okay (about $125 per couple) Atmosphere: excellent  Recommendations: go as many times as you can afford.

My husband had a steak, which he really enjoyed. Our friend had a grilled fish - I can't remember which one - but he said it was perfect. Even though we were cutting it close for the start of the play, we made time for the bread pudding. More than well worth the wait. We had a great time and a wonderful dinner.

A glass of wine, a shady spot in the garden, a gourmet sandwich or salad and some gossip with a friend. Perfect.   Lunch at Tricks gets five stars, easy. But Tricks has two downsides:  - Closed on Sundays, when I most want to pair my pedicure afternoon with a fancy lunch and pretend I'm a lady. - Dinner is only good, not great -- and it's very pricey (entrees alone range from around $20 to $35).  Go for the atmosphere. Go for the sun-filled patio. But if you ask me, just go for lunch.",

I will not divulge what the other items on my test are, just in case you're reading this and want to be my friend.  Or enemy.  Frankly, I don't give a shit.  But if you don't like Tricks, you're out.  The wine tastings, especially the annual Wine Fiesta, are legendary in Phoenix, the bar has more ambience than Tempeans know what to do with and the menu, especially now with the newly cooked up HOT 46 happy hour items, are a gourmand's wet dream.  You can't go wrong with food at Tricks.    Up until recently, if one was hungry on a Friday night, say around 1030, your choices were limited to Casey Moore's (another fabulous drinkery and eatery but of a different ilk than Tricks), a couple of gas inducing Mexican treats at Taco Bell or any of the other something-Berto's dotted around the valley or delivery from pizza pie people.  A few weeks ago, after lamenting this lack of eats at this time on the weekends, I nursed on my third or fifth Guinness while sitting under the trees (growing up through the bar, right overhead) of this sublime bar.  The bartender, Gavin, a bloke who during the day can also suit you up in the finest garments for any occasion from a bris to a board meeting, slid the HOT 46 menu in front of me.  Served Monday thru Saturday from 4 to 6 PM and on Friday and Saturday from 10 to midnite, this delectable and slight menu will sate the hunger roiling inside your belly.  I tried all six items and found nary a clunker in the bunch.   Homemade Artisan Grilled Cheese with Roasted Garlic Tomato Basil Soup - much better than your drunken special made at 240 AM, post-bar with neon-yellow American cheese and penicillin-hosting white bread.  It's fine, people, hits the spot perfectly with a stout.  Flatbread Pizza with Homemade Mozzarella, Fresh Tomato Pomodoro and Basil - finally, a fucking pizza that doesn't come out of my ass the next morning in essentially the same form it went in my mouth, all burny and greasy.  A thin crust with dollops of mozzarella that will make you positively renounce your allegiance to lactose intolerance.  Tolerate it, baby, and eat this pizza.  Herb Crusted Mac & Cheese with Southern Fried Drumettes and Smoked Chili Honey - after eating this three cheese delight (gruyere, cheddar and oaxaca) and sucking the marrow from these tiny, cute little drumettes with breading I wanted to kiss, I went home, took my boxes of mac and cheese from the grocery store and summarily shot them.  Bad food needs to be executed.  Good food, like this fine Tricks take on an old standard, needs to be given a medal.  Antipasto of Cerignola Olives, Cured Meats and Artisan Cheeses - this needs no explanation because it is a standard dish, and by that I do not mean to say it isn't exceptional, but you should recognize that a lovely plate like this is simple and comforting during the draining of a nice Malbec.  I will say that the cheeses were fun, the olives divine and the salami, sliced thin, was amazingly mild, not too fatty or salty, and covered in a reduction of the sweetest sauce.  I wanted to put it on my nipples and lift my breasts to my mouth and lick it off.  Oh, wait, I don't have breasts, or prominent nipples, but I know from my time spent licking liquids from the prominent nipples of not-so-prominent women that this sauce would make even a nipple with an unnoticed, protruding stiff hair totally palatable.  Great dish.  Thai Barbecue Grilled Quail Skewers with Fire Roasted Mango and Szechuan Peppercorn - how can you go wrong eating a pheasantly bird from a stick.  This bird, known to move in short bursts, launched itself on to these long skewers just in time for my sixth Guinness and I thought I was playing matchmaker:  quail, meet beer, meet stomach.  Have fun.  Nothing about mango and quail is conceivably related but hoo-boy did this one hit the spot.  The bird melted down my esophagus.  Fuck you, chicken, I've found my poultry.  Now get back to the frozen food aisle and die again in a microwave.  Trio of Green Chile Veal Breast Tacos with Pumpkin Seed Crema, Pico de Gallo and Queso Oaxaca - fine, I ate a little innocent veal.  And it felt so good.  If you just showed a picture of this dish to the veal in his pen, he would gladly continue on his thankless path to the grocery store.  Run a loop of my face in the vealhouse eating this sublime set of tacos and the little softie would smile at how happy he is going to make his human cousins.  Pumpkin is, in my experience, becoming better every year I stomp around this terra firma.  From pumpkin beers to roasted seeds to the standard pie to this Crema - pumpkin is dick.    So, that's it.  The nicest outside bar I've been to anywhere and my five thousand characters are about to end.    EAT AT",

They keep changing stuff around on the menu with local and seasonal fare, which makes the food fresh and delectable. The pricing is also very reasonable at lunch.   Their outdoor setting is the icing on the quality of the food, especially in Fall and Spring. The last time I was there the service was a little slow, but mostly I have had good service here too.   Best item in my opinion: Lime-Jalapeno Syrup and Ancho Chile Crusted Grilled Pork Tenderloin with Raspberry Serrano Chile Coulis, Smoked Chile Goat Cheese-Sweet Potato Gratin and Cilantro Creme Fraiche. YUMMY!!!!!",

I took away major points for the short ribs which were not warm enough, overly fatty and just not very tasty.  Our group also had a beautiful dessert tray with mini eclairs, petit fours, and tarts.  Desserts were good but looked better than they tasted.  Still I would try it again.  Perhaps the ribs are just not their specialty.",

    "text": "My partner surprised me by taking us here for a late Valentine's day dinner. I had been wanting to try House of Tricks for the longest time, so when I saw that we were going there, I got very excited. Once we were sat down, we perused the menu before tentatively deciding what to get. Unfortunately for my hubby, they were sold out of the prime rib, so he had to choose something else.   We ordered the seared sea scallops for our starter, and they were definitely a highlight of the meal, though I was a bit disappointed that we only got two. They were perfectly cooked, browned just right, and buttery soft. It was served with a cauliflower puree and a root beer gastrique, which were both surprisingly good. The tasty little mollusks definitely got us excited for the rest of the meal.  For our entrees, my partner ordered the grilled lobster medallions, with a mango salsa, and I the porchetta with corn risotto and charred broccoli rabe. After a slightly extended wait, our food arrived and we dug in. One thing I was surprised about was the amount of food I received compared to him. His plate was about half, maybe even a third as full as my dish. He liked his entree, but he did say that the black bean puree that accompanied it was a bit overpowering, in terms of flavor. The porchetta was delicious, as well as the risotto. I could have done without the broccoli rabe, as it was a tad stringy and didn't really complement the rest of the flavors. It was definitely a rich dish, and my partner ended up finishing it for me.   Dessert was just a good as the rest of the meal, maybe even a touch better.  My partner ordered the salted caramel apple bread pudding, which our waitress declared was her personal favorite, and I chose the chocolate cream cake with malted chocolate ice cream. The bread pudding was gorgeous, and had a really nice apple flavor to it. It was incredibly decadent and the caramel really took it to the next level. My dessert wasn't as luxurious, but it definitely sated my chocolate craving. I loved the ice cream that came with it, and found myself wishing for a straw to finish the last bit of it that had already melted.   Service could have been better, but in defense of our waitress, she was taking care of about 8-10 tables. She was very personable though, and the meal balanced out the wait. All in all, I loved the restaurant and couldn't believe how beautifully set up it was. I definitely want to return again and try even more of their wonderful food.",

    "text": "I went here for the first time the other night, and it was fantastic.   The food was awesome. Perfectly cooked and wonderfully seasoned, and with interesting and unique flavor combinations. Our table had a starter of the cheese and fruit plate, which contained a nice variety of items and was big enough for all four of us to have our fill. For my entree I had pan-seared cod with arugula, new potatoes, and beets. It was accompanied with a horseradish cream sauce that was just amazing. I couldn't get over how wonderful each component tasted. I think it was the first time I ever said to myself, \"these beets taste great!\" My dessert was a peanut-butter filled lava cake with ice cream, and I was so full by that point I could barely finish it.. but believe me, I forced myself to. It was that good.  Additionally, their cocktails are awesome. I had the cherry cherry boom boom, and while a bit silly to say the name, it was worth it. The taste was like cherry ice cream with a kick. It actually gave me a slight buzz, so there was plenty of alcohol in it. Which is good, since the cocktails cost quite a bit each. I had a sip of one of my dinner mate's frisky squirrel cocktail, which was also delicious.   The service was great. Our waiter was friendly and attentive. We ate on the patio area, on a table in the corner, and the atmosphere was very cozy at night. One of the house kitties hung around our table being very personable. I think that cat knows the deal very well, because as soon as our plates were delivered, it came over and immediately began meowing and begging for scraps. Of course we had to oblige, just a little.. ;)  I think the only complaint I have is that the plates they serve the food on are a little big for the tables they have, as all four of our plates, cocktails, glasses of water, and other things, just barely fit on the table with some maneuvering (such as moving the flower vase off our table). But that's pretty nitpicky and didn't take away from my enjoyment.   I'll definitely be back!",

But that's as far as my stars went here.  So far, the food has been ok at best. And I don't want to pay that much for just ok. First experience - the online menu didn't match the actual menu. I placed a to-go order for what the website stated was a Southwest Tapas platter, and the person over the phone did not correct me. I was just handed a box containing falafel, tzatziki and something else mediterranean with very (and I mean VERY) stale pita. I like falafal, but I didn't think I was ordering it. And I didn't like this falafel.   Then I went for lunch. The food was alright, not great. The patio was magnificent, the service was mag...horrible. The server was nice, but he also forgot about us. It was busy and I understand how that goes. I still don't think we should have had to crane our necks around for 45 minutes after finishing our meal to ask for the check. Oh well. I'd come again for the atmosphere alone, but I'll stick to wine and a snack.",

    "text": "I had lunch here on Friday for the first time with some coworkers and everyone was very pleased with their food.  Jimmy and Vic each ordered the Cast Iron Green Chile Smoked Pork Tamale and both raved about it.  April ordered the Grilled Salmon with Chive Risotto Cake and loved it.  Jessica ordered the Moroccan Fruit and Chicken Shawarma Salad -- again, she had only good things to say.  I chose the House Made Meat Loaf which is without a doubt the best meatloaf I have ever eaten (sorry, Mom).  Check out the lunch menu for complete descriptions of each dish.  For dessert we ordered the blueberry tea mousse and the bread pudding.  The mousse was excellent, although the dark chocolate crumbles at the bottom of the glass could have been omitted IMHO (and I love dark chocolate).  It didn't really seem to add anything to the otherwise wonderful dessert -- maybe it was because we were all stuffed beyond belief by the time we reached the bottom of the glass.  The real killer, however, was the bread pudding.  If you've never had bread pudding you really should put this on your bucket list, and if you a fan of bread pudding, well, this version, with cubes of apple molded in with the bread cubes and served with a warm cinnamon and brown sugar sauce, will make your head explode.  The very next day I brought my partner, who is a big meat loaf fan, and he seconded my opinion, while I went for the Smoked Pork Tamale (which is a lot of food) and loved every bite.  The restaurant occupies two converted houses and the atmosphere reminded me a lot of Santa Monica -- casual and comfortable.  Plenty of outdoor seating with misters, or you can ask to be seated inside, where I sat both times.  The serving staff was spot on -- very attentive and friendly -- ask for Southie if she's working.  The only downside was they are not open on Sunday and don't serve brunch, just lunch (although I did spot a version of Eggs Benedict on the lunch menu).  Altogether a wonderful dining experience.  Looks like we have a new favorite restaurant!",

    "text": "I was in Phoenix last week for a shoot, and my photographer recommended House of Tricks to me, describing it as the only really upscale restaurant in the Tempe Mill Avenue District.  I wanted to order something pretty light because I had what I thought was food poisoning earlier that morning (it was diagnosed the following day as the stomach flu). I ordered one of the few vegetarian options - pumpkin goat cheese ravioli - and I have to say that I enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would. I usually scoff at pasta entrees that cost more than $15 (this cost $22), but hey, I was on business and not footing the bill. All of the flavors worked together beautifully... the nutty pistachio-spinach pesto, the sweet blood orange balsamic, and the subtle sage creme fraiche. There was some sauteed kale underneath the ravioli; it was the perfect veggie complement to the dish. This was one of the more memorable pasta dishes I've had.   If you sit outside, the candlelight is really, really weak. Be prepared to read your menu with the light from your smartphone screen.  I really liked my ravioli... until my stomach flu reared its ugly head a few hours later, making me run to the closest available toilet for the next 10 hours. The ravioli coming up wasn't as good as it was going down. But if I'm ever in Phoenix again with a stronger stomach, I definitely plan on returning to try some of their meat dishes!",

Our waiter dropped a ramekin of balsamic vinegar on the floor by our table, which splashed all over my leather boots, jacket and pants and shirt.  Instead of getting something to clean it up, our server was preoccupied with the older ladies behind us- which were not hit but whining about their desserts.   Our food got cold while wiping up the mess- because it was everywhere.    I get that this stuff happens, but the lack of care was very surprising.  I served tables for 7 years and I would have been fired if I acted like that to a guest.  My very expensive jacket was ruined...you cannot get vinegar off fabric and when I told them that, the staff acted like I was crazy.  The owner tried to replace my jacket with a cheaper one. I give her credit, she did try to make it right.    Anyways, my cold food was not that great and the experience really sucked.",

    "text": "A friend and I spent a lazy Sunday afternoon at the House of Tricks before heading off to a show at Gammage.    It's right off of Mill Road, so a very quick convenient drive to Gammage.   The parking was very adequate for the location-- parked right out front with NO searching.   We were a bit early for our dinner reservations, so we sat at the outdoor bar and had a few glasses of wine and split the Pecan Smoked Salmon appetizer.  It was an enormous piece of salmon cooked to perfection with a little side salad, onions, capers, and an olive tepenade.  It was served with bruscetta and crackers-- it was a great starter!   The outdoor bar seating was wonderful.  Vine covered patios and lots of plants and foliage, which I love that garden-y feel.    We were taken to a beautiful garden area for dinner-- really had that English garden appeal.    I had the Arugala & Roasted Squash salad.   It was really delicious, but I would have liked a bit more of the squash.  It only had a sprinkling of small diced pieces of squash, where I was hoping for good big bites.  It was still really good, though.  For dinner I had the Pork Loin with a potato gratin, asparagus, and topped with a \"red flame grape agrodolce', which added a nice tangy taste.  The gratin, I felt, was a bit dry- as the potatoes were sliced super thin.    For dessert I had the dark chocolate mousse with raspberry preserves-- AMAZING!!    The service was A+, the atmosphere was A+, the wine was A+, and the food was a solid A...   I would absolutely go back and will probably my new 'go to' place before a show at Gammage.",

    "text": "I feel like I'm being extremely generous with this one.  Luckily for HOT, I had great company which made my overall rating higher than they might deserve.  3.7 stars total - based on the following...  AMBIANCE - 5 stars In a historic house with both indoor and outdoor seating, this is an amazing atmosphere; better than most of the strip malls that the valley is known for!  SERVICE - 4 stars The hostess went above and beyond by moving us from an inside table to an outside table by the fire when we had a change of heart and wanted some fresh air.  They also went above and beyond to help me find a parking spot as I didn't want my car to get towed from the lot next door like Patti B. yelped about previously.  Larissa was our server and she was extremely knowledgeable and friendly.  There was only one thing that was a bit disappointing when it came to service:  that she came by to take our order and I told her I needed a minute and she said she'd be right back but disappeared for around 10 or 15 minutes.  FOOD - 2.5 stars Let me explain:  I chose wrong.  Do not order the Seafood Pistou.  Larissa told me that it was a 'messy' dish, but not minding that, I ordered it anyways.  It was not messy, it was just kind of gross.  The seafood didn't taste so fresh and I think the combo of that and the creamy heavy sauce were what gave me a horrible stomach ache that evening.  However, Kristin C. chose right - she had the Ahi Tuna... it was a beautiful presentation and according to Kristin, it was fantastic!  Note to self:  order Ahi if I ever return!  Oh, and I tasted the Asian Pear Salad too - it was tasty.  So, the 2.5 star rating is an average...   COMPANY - 5 stars! I'm going to allow the fact that I had a really fun dining companion bring up the average a bit here...  BANG FOR YOUR BUCK- 2 stars We had only water and perrier to drink and our bill was still kind of high for what I thought was just an ok meal... essentially 1 salad, 2 entrees, and 1 Perrier was over $80 out the door!  I admit that this review is based on just one experience... however, because of the fact that I have no clue when I'll go back, I wanted to review it anyways!  If you go to HOT, go for the ambiance and order the tuna! :)",

Some of my favorites include Quiche of the day served with salad and fresh fruit, The Grilled Salmon and the Chicken Shawarma Salad (see pics)  The desserts Ive had are also mouthwatering, although they cost almost as much as any of the entrees I've named above. Angel food cake with berries and creme anglaise or the White Chocolate Banana Bread Pudding were both out of this world (see pics)  Service~ seems like a chore to the college pukes who work here, be lucky if you get served at all.  Most recently I watched our waiter through the window completely ignore us the entire time while he drank wine and chatted with some slob at the bar.  I have however been waited on properly, maybe suggesting a female server might help. Bad service has always come from the male staff.  Ambiance~ Love it, inside a cute old house or outside on the Lush and maturely landscaped garden patio.  *Notes* ~Make reservations for lunch or dinner just to be safe ~Bring at least $2 in coin for the parking meters ~Dinner prices are near triple the lunch prices for the entrees ~Ask for a bread and butter basket, chances are you'll be here awhile  **parking meters have an 80min. time limit, mention this if you are having SLOW service  I  have to give 5 stars for the food",

It's too hot right now to sit on the patio, so we had a nice table inside with lots of windows. I ordered the salmon flatbread with arugula. The salmon was so delicious. The flatbread itself was a little chewy, so I would not order this dish again. Others at the table had the lox with black beans, which was artfully presented; the chicken salad with goat cheese, which looked delicious but perhaps had too much bread. We also had a chicken Shwarma salad with fruit, and a house salad with grilled chicken. Everyone loved their meals. We had a delightful time.",

However, the service was unimpressive and that is really what we took away from this place. As mentioned earlier, the lamb was very good and their sole vegetarian dish of portobello tempura was good.  The desserts were hit and miss.  The PB lava cake was good but the bread pudding tasted like pancakes.  I won't bother with dessert next time.    The quality of their entrees and the atmosphere out on the patio make it a recommended place to go. I just wish the service was on par with their food and atmosphere.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I are loyal yelp'ers and we put House of Tricks on our must-see list in Tempe after seeing all the great reviews and we definitely weren't let down.   In located in the middle of a desert, the sprawling grove of trees that surround the restaurant definitely make it stand out. The place looks like an eerie pre-civil war cotton plantation... but it's weirdly romantic and nostalgic.   The food was great! My girlfriend and I attempted to try as much as we could from the menu as our budgets and stomachs would allow. We had:   1. Perfect Peach - We started with a peach cocktail that had a gin in it. It was a very well made cocktail that definitely had the peach flavor while still reminding you that this was indeed an alcoholic drink - very refreshing in 100+ degree weather.   2. Summer Salad with Strawberries and Spinach - This salad was great. It came with spinach, cheese, fennel, strawberries, and candied walnuts. It was tied together by a subtle vinaigrette that still allowed the individual components of the salad to shine while still adding a distinct hue to the salad that would otherwise not be there.  3. Foie Gras with Cinnamon Apple Chutney - This was the first sweet foie gras I've ever had and it was amazing. The foie gras had a nice crust without losing the near liquid creaminess in the center. The chutney was sweet in a way that you could taste the ingredients, but be careful to limit the amount eaten with the foie gras because it can easily overpower the flavor of the liver.   4. Lychee Marinated Duck - As a kid, my only knowledge of duck came in the form of Peking Duck, and damn, this was the most gourmet duck I've ever tried. The sweet and creamy skin and fat of the duck complemented the savory and almost smokey meat so well. The rice was forgettable but the lychee nuts made for a nice dessert.   5. Porterhouse Lamb - My girlfriend ordered medium but the meat came out medium rare. The cut of meat was far too thick to cook well or evenly and that thick of a cut of meat is hard to enjoy. The meat, however, had great flavor and definitely had a robust lamb taste that a lot of other restaurants can't seem to achieve. The lamb literally melts in your mouth - so tender. The sides were pretty good. The eggplant was excellent - the flesh was soft while the skin provided a chewy texture to complement.   Overall, great food and it's a pretty intimate setting. The food was great and the portions were the right size and allowed for more than sufficient enjoyment of each dish without being overkill (definitely a nice break from the huge portions typical of restaurants nowadays). The service was excellent, and for a restaurant of this caliber, the food definitely met all of our expectations but didn't exceed them.   I would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area looking for a romantic spot to take a loved one to.",

For dessert we had amaretto as well.   The only lowlight was the chocolate cake. My guy took a few bites and gave up.

Pros: Quiet adult atmosphere.   Cons: We had salmon with vegetables. Since I was possibly allergic to the puree, I was suppose to get more vegetables instead, but that didnt happen. Food was small portion and not worth the cost. Order was not correct. We were seated under a large umbrella with a table candle light that would not stay lit. As the sun set we could barely see our food. Wait Staff not attentive so we could have our candle table light lit to see our food.  Also be prepare to pay for parking as its located in busy area.

Just kidding, I know why, it's from Costco, and it's frozen haha. They have a huge wine selection, and a quaint little outdoor bar and parking around the area is free after 6! What's not to love about an upscale place in Tempe, where most of used to bar food.  I love coming here and siting on the patio, it makes for a ridiculously romantic evening for you and your honey!

The ribs were also yummy! 3 of us had the braised short ribs & it was great. One of us had the pork chop & it did not disappoint!",

We had the mussels in this delicious cream Sauce that we wanted to lick from the bowel. The ahi tuna was delicious and a lighter options for an entree. The mahi mahi was delicious, the sauce is superb and made the dish. The bread pudding was huge and delicious. We also had the cheesecake with lavendar in the crust-- superb. The wine list is different with wines from Austria and Slovenia as well as France and Italy. Our server was superb. No complaints! A must go! Perfect before a show at the Gammage.",

I got the Cornish hen and he got the bison meatloaf. Just perfect. And from the Valentine's Day special menu we got the chocolate cake and I'm so glad we did. Everything was just perfect. Service was wonderful. I would highly recommend House of Tricks for any romantic dinner!",

The ambiance was great, and it was a cute little restaurant. The service was terrible....I mean terrible. We waited for every single thing, from order taking to food arrival. Our main dishes arrived 40 mins after we ordered. There was never an apology, or even a, \"hey sorry we are running a little behind.\" They simply just allowed us to wait.   The bread they brought out was ok, but it was cold. The butter is what made the bread good, but the bread would be so much better if it was warm.   The food was good, luke warm, but very good. I ordered the short rib, and I loved the flavor and sauce.   I would give it another shot.",

We started with the upside down mushroom and leek focaccia and it was outstanding! Loved the garlicky bite of the sundried tomatoes..I could have eaten just this for dinner. We also had the beet salad but added goat cheese instead of pecorino, I thought it was great. If I had a suggestion it would be for them to add more beets, and bigger pieces.  For dinner I had the salmon, cooked perfectly and I loved the flavor of the lemon curd. The black rice was very tasty. I didn't get the ricotta blob on the side. I also got to taste the pork chop and it was delicious, very juicy and I loved the Dijon mustard-based sauce on the top.   Home run, House of Tricks!",

The menu changes (idk how often) so posting the different things we got probably won't help.   But the menu always has unique, fancy type stuff for a good price! Also the desserts are SO freaking good. One time I got a coffee creme brulee paired with hibiscus tea and omgggg.   The service is also very good and the atmosphere is beautiful! It's so pretty green... and if you like cats you'll love the abundance of furry friends in the yard :)  Hands down, fav place in Tempe.",

My lunch here was celebrating a special event.  And as always, the service was impeccable, the food fabulous and I love their patio.  I enjoyed the wonderful quiche combination - with yummy pork/chickpea soup.   Others enjoyed their burgers and the cornbread BLT - everything was delicious.    What is keeping me from giving this location a full 5-stars is two points - one within their control and one they are not able to do anything about.   I was sad to see their adult version of the PB&J go away - it was so much fun to order and so wickedly good.  I hope they bring it back.    Part of the appeal of this location is their expansive patio - especially in the beautiful Arizona winter - eating \"al fresco\" in the thriving Tempe downtown area.  However, a high-rise building is being erected across the street, which totally blocks the winter sun from their patio.  And, although it was a moderate day (mid-60's), we had to ask for two heaters to be brought to the table.     I will continue to whole-heartedly endorse this fabulous venue, but just  be prepared for a change.  I hope the sun moves north quickly - which will help the early spring visitors.",

    "text": "Our waitress, Sarah, was awful. After searching online for a great place to take my parents for their anniversary, I chose House of Tricks based on great reviews from different sites. I called days in advance to make reservations and mentioned multiple times we were celebrating their anniversary. At first I thought perhaps she was new as she was slow and stares off into space as she tried to remember what the specials were for the day and finally gave up to look at her notes. Then when we said we wanted to share appetizers (the four of us) and asked about the scallops and then she brought 2, I would think she would tell us the $20 scallops only came with 2 when she saw 4 people in front of her. We asked for bread and she said she'd come right back, 10 minutes later we asked again then our entrees came before we even finished the appetizers or got our bread. The next time we saw her was when she dropped off the check and did nothing for their anniversary. So disappointing! This placed was way overpriced for the poor service we received and we enjoy dining out at higher end restaurants several times a month but will NOT return here or recommend it to others. In all fairness the other staff was nice and I did hear the other server for the table near us advise her 4 top against the scallops b/c it only came with 2 pieces and the lamb was a better option to share. It wasnt until I heard her that I decided to write a review about Sarah's bad service--obviously the rest of the staff knew how to do their jobs well.",

I started of with the Duck Taquito with  Pomegranate Reduction and Avocado Mousse. The Taquito tasted like the ones we buy from the frozen section and the sauce was too sweet for the dish.  Next I had the Kale and Marinated Mushroom Salad with Creamy Burrata. This one was a winner and was quite refreshing and tasty. For the Entree, I had the Beef Mole Short Rib with Tamale Mashed Potatoes. omg. get this !!! It was amazing ! Right amount of flavor and texture was on the plate. The beef was so tender and had a good ration of fatty and lean portions. I ended the meal with the Caramel bread pudding. Now this was a True stunner ! The caramel sauce was sweet and rich and perfectly paired with the bread pudding. One might say that the pudding is a little dense and rich. But hey, its bread pudding after all !! Service was exceptional and our server Andrew had a pleasant smile throughout the service. They were even prompt in fixing an error with my friend's entree.  Overall, lovely ambiance, great service and gorgeous food !",

    "text": "To be perfectly honest, when I heard the name \"House of Tricks,\" an upscale restaurant isn't the first thing that came to mind. It sounds more like the name of some low-grade dirty carnival funhouse. I fully expected to be greeted by some fat, sweaty carny with a bad comb-over and a shirt two sizes too small - with buttons on the verge of bursting from a failed attempt to contain his massive beer belly.  \"Hey, hey! Step right up! Come witness the illusions, the magic, and the thrills found within the House of Tricks!\"  Instead of the funhouse that I was expecting, House of Tricks, which is named after the owners, is a restaurant operating in a converted cottage house. Consider them ahead of their time. While home-converted restaurants seem standard fare in \"foodie\" areas of Phoenix, I doubt many people were doing this in 1987 when they first opened.   We sat outside next to a heat lamp. I'd compare the atmosphere to something similar to what you'd get at a place like Cibo. So if you're a sucker for atmosphere and base your rating on \"vibes,\" then you'll probably be quite pleased.  We started with some bread and split the Roma lettuce wedge, which included yogurt curry vinaigrette, carrot ribbons, dates, cashews, squash chips, and cheese curds. It was decent, although I think we would have preferred it better in traditional salad form.  The artisan cheese plate seems to be a very popular starter, so that's what we decided on. Honestly, unless you're a sewer rat and love virtually all cheese, these plates are always a gamble. We didn't care for many of their choices, which steered more towards the 'bleu\" family. The addition of honey and mustard, as well as some bread and candied nuts were all nice little touches, however. Nothing was particularly bad, it just didn't really cater towards our palettes.    Unfortunately, I actually think the lunch menu at House of Tricks looks far more exciting than the dinner menu. They like their seafood here, which leaves me with limited options. I ended up ordering the 6oz beef tenderloin cooked medium. I liked it. My girlfriend ordered a special, which was meat prepared in some kind of Japanese style. She wasn't really a fan. Again, not so much an issue with quality, just a matter of personal taste, I guess.  For dessert, we ordered the salted caramel apple bread pudding, which also just seemed kind of standard. We didn't end up finishing it, which is incredibly rare.  Server(s) seemed kind of disorganized, but polite about it. We asked to keep our bread, only to have it taken away by someone else, only to have it returned after our main server kept reminding them repeatedly to bring out more.  There wasn't really anything particularly bad about the food or the experience. As another reviewer pointed out, if you're a frequent diner, you just kind of feel all blase about it. Sadly, we've seen it before and we've seen it done better. And if we're going to drop over 100 bucks on a meal, this would not be my first choice.  Despite mentioning in the reservation that my girlfriend was celebrating her birthday, it was not acknowledged - so if you're going here for a celebration, don't expect any special treatment. I guess it's just not one of their specialty areas.  I felt it was worth trying at least once, just for the sole purpose of crossing it off of my bookmark list. Maybe there was a time when this place would be considered one of the premier fine-dining spots in the Valley, but with so many other places opening in recent years, I find it hard to justify any repeated visits.",

For desert we the the brownie and the cheesecake with lavender OMG.  Our waitress Kate was fantastic.  What a quaint restaurant.  We sat inside but they have misters and really nice outside seating. I would definitely go back.  Enjoy.",

Outside is cute with all the trees, can't wait to bring the hubby. But you would never guess it Was in Tempe.  From the pictures, I was worried I would still be hungry after because the plates seems dainty. But I was pleasantly surprised I left completely full.  I started with the raspberry ice tea. We split the sweet potato goat cheese cakes. It was one of those things where it had some random ingredients and it tasted so good. Then I had the Caesar salad. It was pretty good size and was garlicky as promised. Last I had the harissa mussels as my meal. Wow it was huge and so flavorful. I almost wish I had rice to eat the sauce with because the pieces of bread wasn't enough.  We ended with splitting the bread pudding. Very good as well.  Service was great. Everyone was friendly. Can't wait to be back.",

    "text": "My wife and I had reservations on Valentines day. We were sat right away, we liked the atmosphere of the restaurant very much. However, throughout the night our service was very poor. The area where we were sitting in seemed to have 2 main servers, but neither of them were ours. We saw our server very rarely and we were the only table in the area where we were sitting to be served by him and it definitely felt like that as he was at our table maybe 3 times - he did not go over the valentines day specials with us, and only became aware of them after we had ordered and overheard the table next to us get educated on them. We ordered the Korean BBQ ribs for an appetizer. The ribs came out after a good amount of time after ordering (more than 30 min) and were quite cold. We did not know if they were supposed to be cold but our waiter was nowhere to be seen to ask. The eaten ribs sat on our table for another 30 minutes with no attempt by anyone to clear it until our main courses showed up and we actually had to request that the empty plate be removed so they could fit our main dishes on our table.    I ordered the meatloaf, which was good. My wife ordered the Gnocchi. The gnocchi was not what she was expecting based on the description of the dish and she was very disappointed with it. Unfortunately, again our waiter was nowhere to be found to voice our concerns and we finally had to flag someone down in the area to find him. When we said she didn't enjoy the gnocchi, he made no attempt to offer an alternative or anything else - since she had barely touched the dish he just said 'oh, I'm sorry to hear about that' and just stared at us. At this point, we were quite put off and requested our check - the only time of the night he actually came back very quickly to our table.   This was very frustrating as we were so excited to try this place for the first time based on the other reviews we have read. Our experience was one that makes us not want to return, even though so many others seem to have had a good experience. This is not what we would have expected, either in the quality of the food or the quality of service, for a restaurant of this prestige and budget range.",

I was surprised to learn that the restaurant has a completely different kitchen and chef for lunch and for dinner so, unfortunately, I was not able to get the pasta dish which did not make me happy and I told my waitress that. She was so sweet an apologized and promised I'd love their dinner just as much. I was not convinced but we decided to stay and try out some other food.   Wow!!! I didnt think it was possible for everything I put in my mouth to be as amazing as it was. We ordered the Charcuterie Plate and the Ceasar salad to start with and I got the Ancho Spiced Six Ounce Beef Tenderloin for my entree. My friend ordered the Seared Pink Peppercorn Crusted Ahi Tuna. Both were AMAZING. I dont know what the sauce is that they use with the tenderloin but I have never tasted anything so flavorful. I am not a huge red meat lover but was definitely impressed with this dish and was actually glad the pasta was not on the menu so I was forced to try something new.   I dont think you could ever be disappointed with any of the food options here, lunch or dinner!",

    "text": "\"Meh. I've experienced better\" is Yelp's description of two stars and I couldn't agree more.  We had a reservation for 6 at 6:30 on a Tuesday in March (during spring break) and arrived and were sat promptly. Waters delivered, wine ordered....25 minutes later the wine was delivered and our waiter seemed surprised we were ready to order.   I got the soup of day, which was a pork tamale and the caesar salad. I ordered them both as my entree (at least, I thought that was obvious), yet the soup was delivered at least 20 minutes before my salad and everyone else's meals. That was a little awkward. The soup itself was fine. Nothing I'd order again, but not bad and a good size for $8. The salad was very overdressed and the croutons hard, but the lettuce was fresh and the size decent. I'd get it again with the dressing on the side.  The patio is very cute, but the wicker chairs hurt to sit on (in a dress) and are angled for relaxing, not eating.  Overall the service was extremely lacking and the entire meal took 2.5 hours to complete. I would not return.   As an aside- Two people in my group got the mushroom etouffee and thought it was great (sea bass and pea/cous cous salad did not receive good reviews.)",

I asked for spice because I wasn't willing to more salt to the meal to make it even flavorful.  That took about 25 minutes to get and at that point my food was cold. When I let my server know all she said is \"well now you know.\" So what does that mean? Don't come back? I don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.",

Although it was a chilly evening, we chose to eat outside near a heater and it actually got quite warm and toasty.   We all loved our meals- soup, steak, lamb, etc.  We were curious about the name and our server shared that the owner's last name is Tricks- so, there you go! The ambiance was relaxing, quiet and welcoming.",

The arugula, date & orange salad was delicious - I think I will start adding dates to my salads at home now.  I would have given five stars but the bison meatloaf was a little heavy & purple potato puree was a little starchy but they both tested good. The staff members were fantastic.",

It's such a sweet place, beautifully laid out and decorated, lovely ambiance.  It feels small and cozy, but it seems like they have a lot of seating areas.  We wanted to sit outside, so we grabbed a table at the outside bar area.  Service was very prompt, and everyone was super nice and friendly.  Food was absolutely incredible.  We started off with the bread and ahi tuna, then had the tenderloin and poached ono for our main courses, and finished with the salted caramel bread pudding.  So delicious.  I kind of want to go back to Tempe just to go back here for dinner.",

Well, it was unusual for Phoenix to be in the low 50's that late aftrrnoon, so asked to be seated inside and they refused to accommodate us. After waiting for some of our people to arrived, they noticed that even with their heaters 4 people of my party were freezing and still would not allow us inside, when they had plenty of room.  One of my coworkers was eating with her gloves on. The next thing was the server Karen. She was so rude when we asked for separate checks.  I know that may take longer and it may be a pain in the ass to do so, but she didn't even hide it. Her facial expression said it all! So RUDE! The food was good, but again, their customer service sucks big time!  Even after we left they didn't have enough customers and more than half of the inside sitting was empty. Very disappointed at this place that I doubt any of us will be back.",

When we mentioned it to waiter he apologized but did not offer any solution to rectify the error. He did not offer us anything, in fact, he avoided our table for the rest of the meal. I'm only giving them three stars because the service was horrible but the food was adequate.

I often come during lunch time and it is better to come here during the cooler months since the outside patio is a pretty place to sit with sometimes an ongoing fire.  Brought my brother here when he was in town, who is a chef, and he was very pleased with his food. He actually got some ideas from his meal.  This is definitely one of our favorites with a friendly staff. Whatever I have tried at House of Tricks is always delicious. Today I had the Salmon with risotto over a salad enhanced with mango - WOW. Also, I would recommend any of their specials, they are always well prepared and taste is always on key. Props to the chef, will come here time and time again. :)",

We ordered a sirloin burger and a grilled chicken sandwich.  I found the burger was juicy but a bit bland with some flavorful cheddar cheese and onions.  The chicken sandwich was tasty with a pesto seasoning.  The chicken sandwich came with a side of fruit salad. The salad had a light amount of a salad dressing vinaigrette on it. The fruit included small bits of strawberry, blueberry, kiwi, and pineapple. The burger came with a side of house-made potato chips that were a bit overcooked. It took a while to get our order but we were in no rush.",

Perfectly cooked medium paired with red potatoes and a creamy broccolini  rapini. We finished dinner with the salted caramel bread pudding which we are still talking about! Our server was sweet and attentive. I recommend this place to friends and family all the time. Sit on the patio if the weather is permitting.

We started with cocktails. I had the New Old Fashioned which was delicious.  The liquor was infused with vanilla bean and fig and topped with citrus bitters.  So good.  My friend had a margarita that has chili pepper infusion.  She liked her drink too.  We shared the cheese tray, which was excellent.  A nice variety of cheeses, toasty bread, nuts, and grapes.  More than ample portion for two.  We both decided on the short ribs on a bed of white cheese grits.  SO GOOD!  Meat was fall off the bone tender and seasoned to perfection.  Will definitely order this again.  When we arrived we were given the choice of inside or outside seating.  As much as we hated to pass up the beautiful outdoor seating area, it was really hot so we opted for inside.  Go glad we did because we were able to linger over our drinks and dinner while staying completely comfortable.  Our waiter was delighted and provided excellent service.  Love House of Tricks!",

I had lamb chops and she had a seafood special that day. We had only been once before and our waitress bent over backwards to help us decide what to order and to help accommodate their dishes with my wife's dairy allergy. We went for our anniversary and they genuinely made us feel special. Thank you for the unforgettable night. The only thing I can knock is the dessert selection - again my wife has a dairy allergy which pretty much limits her to nearly nothing on dessert menus when we dine out, but we ended up going to PF Chang's for their Great Wall of chocolate. That and bathroom location and size was kind of bizarre. But I really had to dig to find anything negative to say",

The staff definitely did wonders here trying to fuel or pre-bachelorette party night fun last Saturday.   The restaurant appears to be an old historic house - possibly even two houses connected together by a long welcoming stretch of a patio. It had been a rainy evening and cold one at that, so it was nice to get into the dining area where the ambiance had cozy and refined wrapped up in a bundle!  I think our server was the resaturant manager. He did everything in his power to make our experience wonderful for our group of 10 girls.   Memorable items of the night: Old fashioned drink - very well done and potent here. My first glass was Makers Mark infused with Vanilla and I think maple as well. They ran out of it for the second round, so my second glass was with Woodford Reserve as requested.   Rack of Lamb - the special of the night. Cooked to perfection. Tender, not gamey at all!  Scallop appetizer - Appetizes only two people since there were only two scallops on the plate, but it was served with a quaint arrangement of small thin but very flavorful well seasoned vegetables. This is big coming from me, because as an outspoken meatatarian, it is usually difficult to get me to eat vegetables, yet I loved these ones.  The homemade butter was spiced and delicious in its own right when served before out appetizers with sliced baguettes.   Overall cozy, warm, inviting restaurant. I'd say it's Tempe's own hidden gem.",

    "text": "My group of 5 couples went here for our dinner for prom. We made reservations inside, since it can get hot in May, and were seated in the red room.  We started off by ordering drinks and starters. My date and I ordered the Pork Butt and the couple next to is had the Bone Marrow. We were served bread and butter while we waited. The bread was soft on the inside with a nice crust outside. The butter was a sweet herb butter. My date and I loved the appetizer we got. I tried a little of the Bone Marrow and it was very good as well. Next we ordered our entrees. My date ordered the Beef Tenderloin and I ordered the Chicken. When it arrived both plates looked delicious. However, when I actually tried the chicken is was under seasoned and over cooked. Even when I tried layering it with the sides that come with the dish it was not good. Definitely was not worth almost $30 and which is disappointing since I love chicken. My date ordered his tenderloin medium rare and was happy with how it was cooked. I tried a couple bites and wish I would've ordered it instead since it was tender and delicious tasting.  We didn't order dessert since we had the dance to go to. So we requested the check. They apparently can't separate checks and gave us one with everything on it. That's fine but for five teen boys trying to figure out how much they owe, was pretty confusing. Luckily our waitress was able to split the food up by couple while still on the same bill and all was worked out. My only other qualm was that our waitress would not check in on us for extended amounts of time. Some of the boys were very thirsty and drank their water in a couple minutes and waited about 20 for a refill.  I had high hopes for this restaurant since it was a higher end restaurant and a boy in out group was the one who suggested it because he'd eaten their before. I may go back, but I'll consider other restaurants first.",

Boyfriend took me here for my birthday and even though I read it wasn't good, I ordered the Seafood Pistou because it just had a ton of seafood that sounded good (salmon, mussels, clams, tuna, something else I can't remember). You know what this dish needs. SOME CHEAP PASTA. Sounds contradictory for a pricey restaurant with high quality meats, I know, but there was so much garlic pesto in the \"shallow broth\" that I really wanted some pasta to help soak some of that up. It was good, though.  Boyfriend wanted to \"try something new\" and rather than taking a small step from meat and potatoes, he ordered the seared tuna. WTF. I ended up eating the tuna because he didn't like the texture (I thought, duh), but he liked the sesame noodles it came with. He ate them while he drooled over the filet on mashed potatoes at the table next to us. NEVER AGAIN, I told him. :)  The salmon cakes were good and I enjoyed the salad they were served on.   I enjoy coming here for lunch because the portions aren't much different for the price, but isn't that the story of lunch v. dinner, anyway?",

This is a place I feel comfortable being a little more adventurous than usual as everything has been delicious.    The patio is amazing.  You completely forget that you are only steps away from drunken college students and the main drag of bars.  I swear, this patio somehow transports me to a different place until I walk out of the gate and remember where I am.  The only \"eh\" part about House of Tricks has been hit or miss service.  The very first time I went, our server was absolutely terrible - not even greeting our table for about 15 minutes (and no, this is not an exaggeration).  On the visits since then it has been much better (although it was very easy to improve from the low bar set the first time).  There have been a few instances in which I wish my server was a little more attentive but overall, not too shabby.  This is definitely a place I will return to again and again.  And order whatever catches my eye, because I know it will be delicious!",

We sat at a table near the outdoor bar and I positively love the patio. What a gorgeous view. It has a lovely feeling about it, and it's relaxed. For happy hour, they have a drink menu with some exquisite, albeit, pricey choices. I chose a Frisky Squirrel or something of a similar silly name and it definitely boasts a tasty, fresh ginger flavor.   We also ordered some bites from the 4-6 p.m. Monday-Saturday menu: pizza with fennel sausage (for $3 more), chicken wings, bruschetta with goat cheese, and mussels. HOLY MACKEREL, the mussels came in a scrumptious broth that we all fought after-- there was a tomato, fishy, sodium-licious broth that they came in and we dunked our extra pieces of bread in it until the bowl was dry.  The bruschetta? Perfectly acceptable. The pizza? I have some qualms. I could have made this pizza myself. There was nothing special about it-- the sausage was baked in the cheese on top of the pizza, which would make Bianco cringe, and drowned the fennel flavor in cheese and tomatoes. Meh. The chicken wings were the perfect mix of baked and flavorful goodness. I highly recommend ordering these.   I would come back for a nice date or a happy hour again and I am really excited to finally enjoy this Tempe gem.",

This clever house of tricks keeps their way over priced, mediocre food and horrible service well hidden until you, and your wallet, have already be taken. Quite the slight of hand!!  I made the mistake of taking my family there for my wife's birthday (6 of us altogether). After sitting for 15 minutes we were greeted by Ben who immediately let us know through his inaction and disinterest that this was going to be a long night of \"no service\". Ben didn't need to be concerned, though-he was getting his tip no matter what he did, or didn't do for this table. Our choice should have been Burger King for the service, if nothing else. Sorry, no disrespect to those who wear the crown ;-). The bottom line-the House of Tricks has THE WORST SERVICE in Arizona!!!   Their overpriced food features barely palatable dishes and the portions are small. If you eat there don't expect any \"wow\" from the food. The only \"wow\" you will get is when you see the bill!!  In this economy Arizona has seen the doors of many restaurants shut. We don't need a magic door at the House of Tricks, but we do need it to close!!!",

Sandwich was amazing and I feel the other fellow yelpers were right this place is very tasty :)    However, our service was not up to par AT ALL. He was tall, slender with a dark beard with hints of grey in it..hmm well I was waiting for my guest and ordered a cup of coffee.. so far so good. When my guest finally arrived we waited about 15 minutes until he approached us. He asked what my guest wanted to drink and the minute he said ill just have water and was about to say we are ready to order or waiter was gone. He rushed away, dropped off water and left again! So confused... then when we finally flagged him down he un-enthusiastically recommended some entrees(since we bother have not been there) and that was about it. Not personal at all. No fun!   Great food, will come back for that but hopefully next time we will have quality service to go along with their quality food!",

For a certain chicken dish I might commit murder. It's called the Ballantine Chicken. Imagine if you could make chicken into an orgasmic experience. A crispy skin that oozes juices as it is pierced with your knife. The stuffing made with brioche and all presented on a puree of fresh butternut squash. OMG! The raspberry iced tea is delightful, as is their wine selection. Sometimes it's nice to find a place in the middle of the city that makes you feel as if you are on vacation. The historic houses that make up the indoor seating are adorably rustic with modern twists. Take someone you love here...",

I call it my special occasion spot...for anniversaries, birthday's etc.  It's different in that you'll see anywhere from corporate execs to professors to those who decided to travel from outside their north Scottsdale suburbs.  I used to live about 2 miles north and now the only thing I regret is not having gone there more frequently.  For lunch, try their iced tea...very refreshing.  Sandwiches and salads are tasty.  Any dinner entree (especially beef) is sure to please.  My out of town friends were surely impressed!",

The wines by the glass are good and the app selection had decent variety.  The short rib app is really good and has a nice kick.  The shrimp/fish cake was dry and marginal so he took it off the bill.  The atmosphere is nice because you can sit outside at the bar, misters, fairly quiet, cool place.  We were there somewhat late and so it seemed that all of the employees were drinking and smoking at the bar.  That was a little annoying.  I get that they are off and want a drink, that's cool.  However, it's a business so the customers should have the run of the place.  Either way, I would recommend it.",

    "text": "Wow.  ONLY thing that holds me back from giving it five stars was one of the hostesses.  I did not have a reservation, and asked if there would be any availability for a table for one.  Here is the wrong thing to say, which is exactly what she said:  \"Oh, you can just sit at the bar.  Same menu and everything.  It's heated.\"  I tried to be kind, which is hard when I'm talking to a dismissive little blond college chick, but I explained that it was the courtyard atmosphere that I wanted - so no, I would not be sitting at the bar, and if no tables were available, I completely understood.  \"We've got a lot of groups tonight... I mean, it would be a long time before a table opened... like twenty minutes.\"  I told her that was fine, and that she could find me at the bar when my table was ready.  I hadn't even sipped my wine before she came and got me.  So frustrating that was the start to the experience, because everything else was five-star all the way.  My server was one of the best I've ever experienced:  he was attentive but not in the way, gracious beyond measure - seriously perfect.  The courtyard was beautiful, lit by candles and surrounded by trees so as to be hidden in a patch of Eden.  The cats roaming around were quirky and lent a warmth that such an upscale experience can lack.  From the time I was seated until I left, it was perfect.",

I can see how college couples and the nouveau riche would find House of Tricks to be a cut above; after all, if you're paying a lot of money, it MUSt be a good place, right?

    "text": "Went in for my birthday. My fiance wanted a nice place in the heart of Tempe and this place was recommended. We made reservations and arrived 5 minutes early. We approached the hostess stand and told them about our reservation and they told us there will be a wait. After 30 minutes go by my fiance comes up and asks how much longer (now way past our reservation) and the hostess response: 'I guess we can take you now'. We didn't let it bother us because it was my birthday. Our server came in a timely manner and got our drinks, appetizer, and told us she would come back for our entrees. We were already to order then but she left. After 45 minutes goes by, we have our drinks(delivered not from our server), we have our apps (not from our server) and now finished waiting to still put in our order. The server in the mean time repeatedly went to the table right next to us (no acknowledgment)as we wait. It wasn't until I walked into the managers office and politely asked to get our bill as this wasn't the birthday I hoped. The manager took it upon himself to make things right and took over or table. He proceeded to take our order and offered another bottle of wine. He turned things around for us and that was very appreciated. The server finally stopped by after we were already eating and saw that her manager stopped by. She never apologized but instead stated that she was busy with another table and assumed everything was good. To make things more awkward her blouse came undone, she turned around and giggled.   At the end, the manager continued to take care of our table. He was extremely generous and the only reason we will be coming back.   I come from a restaurant background and currently a manager at one. This manager was exceptional and made my birthday night turn around to end on good terms. I wish I could remember his name to thank him.",

They got us in quick with very little wait time but it was also later at night (9ish) However, I would try to make a reservation if possible if you plan on going during busier dinner times.   The place itself is very cute and quaint, we sat outside and there is greenery all around you. White tablecloths but we wore average dress clothes (casual dress with heels and jeans with collared shirt) and fit right in.  A little Pricey but SO worth it. We didn't try any entrees because our friends told us try the muscles off the appetizer list. We are HOOKED! We got the artisan cheese plate and the Muscles off the starter list and they were both amazing!! The plates are large and we shared the cheese and muscles between the two of us and it was light and perfect and just the right amount of food. The couple next to us both got entrees and they looked pretty large and they also looked absolutely DELICIOUS. We will have to try some next time we visit.   YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE!!! We recommend it to everyone we know!! It's SO worth it! Service was great, fast and very nice, food was delicious, and we had a great night!",

The only slightly negative experience was in the bar area before our reservation was ready. We ordered a round of drinks while we waited and the bartender/server seemed very impatient and short with us... Let's say, the opposite of engaging... Not a big deal but the ladies ordered Prosecco, which they did not have. Instead of telling us they don't serve Prosecco, they passed off a different cheap sparkling white wine hoping we wouldn't notice. Our server later confirmed that they do not serve Prosecco.

I'm not sure what it was going for. Wine was fine nothing spectacular.  This place survives because of it quaintness.  Waiter was nice and paid enough attention.",

    "text": "I visited with my family after having made a Yelp reservation for 7:45pm at about 7pm the same day. The restaurant was still pretty busy at that point but we were seated in a small dining room with only one other party. We had just been at the Desert Botanic Gardens and just needed a bit of a snack, so we ordered salads and a few appetizers. I ordered the romaine salad wedge that's served with a  yogurt curry vinaigrette and it was absolutely delicious. For appetizers we order the cheese plate, jalapeno goat cheese grits, and the Korean BBQ ribs. The cheese plate was fine but nothing special, same with the grits - just meh. But the ribs were absolutely awesome! Smoked perfectly then sauced just ever-so-slightly such that you weren't overwhelmed but you got the flavor without a ton of sugary bbq sauce. The only thing that wasn't great was the service. Once the other table in the room left, we were ignored and had to move empty salad plates to the table next to us so we could have some room. Then we had to flag someone down to refill our water.  Overall the food was good and the atmosphere was interesting and I would visit again but not near the end of the evening.",

It's a peaceful and relaxing atmosphere especially since we've been hanging out at ASU haunts.  We came during happy hour so we sat at the outside bar and ordered off the happy hour Tapas-like menu. We ordered the ceviche and the chiles arepas/pork dish.  Both were beautifully plated and very delicious. Cocktails were good. The mango margarita was a little disappointing. We thought it would be spicier. But the rose by the glass (the only choice by the glass) and the Gentle Ben cocktail were great. Bar staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. Delivery of dishes was very quick. When we come back to Tempe, this restaurant will most definitely be revisited.",

The seemingly too bored to care hostess said the only other option was also by a door, despite there being MANY open tables. We sat and were ignored for about 10-12 minutes before a bus boy dropped a basket of icy cold, dry baguette slices on our table and told us the compound butter this evening was \"orange poppy seed\" (sweet). We waited another 10 minutes without anyone giving us a word or a glance, despite several waitstaff walking by our table several times. We got up and left without anyone saying a word. My daughter realized she left her purse and went back to get it. A waiter was standing near our table and he looked at her questioningly but still not a word. I don't know whether we were ignored because we were two women, or they have bad service generally, or it was just a bad night. We walked over to La Bocca and were welcomed beautifully and served a delicious meal (see review). When next in town, we will revisit La Bocca (a house of treats for us) but not House of Tricks.",

    "text": "It bums me out to say this, but we did not have a good experience here. We were seated directly next to the kitchen which was uncomfortably hot, so much so that the table next to us asked to be moved because it was so bad. I wish we had moved as well because that one tiny bathroom-sized vent was definitely not large enough to cool that size room. When we left, we discovered that with the misters on, it was actually cooler outside on one of the warmest days of the summer so far.   Service was fine, but food was pretty lackluster. We started with the tuna poke which was good, but not great. My fiance and I both had the beef tenderloin with mashed potatoes and garlic spinach. Flavor was ok, but the steaks were rare to blue when we both ordered medium rare. We let our server know (no manager stopped by), but didn't even bother asking for it to be re-fired to the temperature of our liking because it was so hot in there, that we were mostly set on getting out as soon as possible. Against our original plans, we were wooed by the desert choices so we hung around for that thinking that might save our experience, only to be let down by that as well. I ordered the tres leches cake with plum sauce on the side. The cake was boring, the whip cream had a strange menthol flavor (I think they were going for mint, but it tasted very artificial), and thank goodness I had the plum sauce on the side because that was so bizarre -- extremely medicinal tasting and completely inedible. My fiance had the flourless turtle brownie which was dry as all heck and literally had one pecan in the entire thing. It tasted like I tried to make a microwave mug brownie but cooked the crap out of it. $120 out the door for a very mediocre dinner. We will not be returning.",

    "text": "There are a lot of positives about this place as others have stated: the romantic patio outside, the excellent food, and generally very good service.  But the last two times left a bad taste in my mouth, figuratively speaking.    As a go-to place for special occasions, the last time was Valentine's Day.  With bad weather, my wife and I ate indoors for a change.  Tables were cram-packed together and I felt like my romantic interlude was with the people at the adjoining tables.  Not fun.  This time, we were joined by another couple to celebrate my wife's birthday.  I had called ahead while making the reservation to see what they might be able to do for her, as it was a major birthday.  Nothing--besides putting a candle in her dessert.  Unless I wanted to pay an arm and a leg to buy a cake.    So it was a bit extra warm that night and I asked if they could turn on the misters.  One guy went away to say they would try....later to find they couldn't do it.  So we stayed outside, a bit on the toasty side.  (We didn't want a repeat of Valentine's Day).  The food was good...I had the Salmon in Ponzu sauce, which was previously well-reviewed before.  When I checked with the waiter when it was dessert time if he was going to take care of the birthday preparations, he told me it was the first he had heard of it!   Good thing I said something!  My Key Lime Cheesecake was pretty good.  But the chocolate nougaty thing my wife ordered for dessert was like a Snickers bar that sat in the freezer--very hard and practically inedible...she practically had to chase it around the table as it kept jumping off her plate as she tried to cut into it!  Then when we got the check, it was near closing, and we never saw our waiter again.  We waited quite a while until finally the busboy came by to pick up our payments.  It was like we were deserted.  Considering this place ain't cheap, I expected better service and more attention to detail regarding the birthday preparations.  If you want a low key celebration, here's the place to go.  If you want the staff to get into it a bit more, this is NOT the place to go.  Heck, even Applebee's gives you a singing chorus for your birthday!  While the kitchen is still very good, I think the staff needs a bit more snap and caring about their customers to warrant a return.",

I was sitting on one side of the table that was on the other side of a half wall/open window type thing, which was less than 12 inches from the guy at the table next to us. The kitchen was right by us as well so there were dishes being slammed around and lots of other loud things going on. We asked to be moved outside even though it was a little on the warm side. The patio is nice, although I wasn't a fan of the random cat that showed up (other than funny internet pictures, I do not see a use for cats).   We each chose a different app, entree and dessert. I wasn't excited about the salad but it turned out to be great! The entree and desserts were the highlight of the meal. We had the arugula salad, pork belly, short ribs, hoki, cinnamon roll and strawberry shortcake. All of it was pretty damn tasty!   I think the food is worth the price and the porch is great for casual wine drinking :) I'll definitely be coming back!",

For some reason, I LOVE all of the soups that House of Tricks has to offer.  I think this place has the best soup in the valley.  Random, perhaps, but give it a try!   I like that they have a seasonal menu, and it changes with some regularity.  It's great to go back to a restaurant you enjoy and you find new and exciting food options to choose from.   Working in Tempe, I've gone here for work lunches a few times.   I definitely recommend the French Dip - melts in your mouth, so flavorful!  Or...my other go-to is the Grilled Chicken sandwich with goat cheese.  You had me at goat cheese....   On the dinner menu, I've tried several fish dishes - salmon and halibut are my favorites.   I love that this American style menu always has some unexpected twists and turns on the menu.   Definitely worth checking out.  And with the cute house vibe and great ambiance, this place will score big points for a date night too!",

    "text": "I almost gave HOT three stars, and the only reason why I didn't is because I had a better dining experience last night than I had the previous few times I have eaten at HOT.  I want to be clear and say that the only reason I gave it 4 stars is that the food really is very good... and that's basically the point of eating at a restaurant, right?  And the service was amazing.  Our server was friendly, helpful, and attentive.  And I really do love the ambiance.  (Great date spot!)  My main issue with HOT is the price of the food, especially because the portions are quite small.  Here is what we ordered and how my friend and I felt about it: 1. The \"Bloody Mary\" Salad, which is tomatoes and a lot of other fresh goodies.  Delicious. 2. The seared scallops over cauliflower puree.  The scallops were good, but there were only 2 of them, and they weren't that large.  Also-- and this may be a personal preference-- but the cauliflower puree was very smooth, but such a viscous and thick texture that I wasn't a fan of it.  Also, I truly love cauliflower, and it tasted nothing like cauliflower. 3.  The mussels (which is one of HOT's signature dishes).  They are technically a starter, but I ordered them as my main course.  Honestly, I did not love them.  They were a little cold, which does no favors for mussels' texture.  Also, I don't like a creamy sauce for them-- I would rather something more wine or stock-based.  (Again, this is a matter of personal opinion, but I don't think mussels should be in something creamy.)  The flavor was good, but not great. 4..  The beef tenderloin with butter whipped potatoes and bacon demi-glace.  We ordered it medium-rare and it was PERFECT.  One of the best bites of meat I have ever had.  Basically, I feel that HOT is hit-or-miss... and that would be okay, if it weren't for the price.",

It is an old cottage converted into a restuant but dine in their patio for a perfect date night.  They change their menu seasonally, another brownie point for that, because it shows they don't shove soemthing from the freezer onto your plate. If you go there in Fall/Winter don't miss their mussels in broth, which is an entree sized appetizer. Dipping their freshly baked bread in the mussels broth, sitting by the fireplace, in their tree covered patio on a winter night, is one of the nicest things I have done in Tempe.   Fairy lights which stay on for most part of the year make the ambience enchanting, and, are a perfect accompaniment for sipping a glass of red wine.",

They have a good and eclectic wine list with pretty good prices. We ate inside due to the chilly night and were taken care of, even offered dessert on the house to make up for the Ahi dish.  I look forward to our next visit!",
