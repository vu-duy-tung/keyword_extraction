Though while on the outside, it looks like just a chain bagel place, its way more than that.  Chompies sandwiches taste just like (to me) some of the best Jewish delis Ive been to in NYC...honestly, its that good.      My faves:          **Jewish Sliders-What Chompies is best known for (as well as featured on Man VS Food for), a very hearty combo of 3 cholla rolls filled brisket, mini potato pancakes & Jack cheese, and a side of gravy. THE BEST Sandwich I have had in Arizona, hands down.           **The Brooklyner Triple Decker-(pastrami, corned beef, and braised brisket on double baked Jewish rye).  It has it all, the only thing I do to it is ask the server to add coleslaw too it which puts it over the top",

Great prices on yesterday's bread, by the way, and they still look really fresh (but I personally haven't tried them).  Like others have said, there is usually a bit of a wait to get in (especially on weekend mornings) but it's worth the wait. Prices aren't too bad--they're fair but if you're eating in and you tack on some O.J. and coffee, you'll be looking at close to 20 bucks for your meal alone.  Most of the time when I come here, I'm just grabbing something from the deli and taking it with me somewhere (like Tempe Town Lake or South Mountain). Solid experience every time I do this--just be sure to tell the person behind the counter exactly what you want exactly how you want it.",

Our recent two visits are examples. The mile high beef brisket had so little meat I questioned if it was the mile high. We used to get enough fries to share but on a recent visit there were 8 fries by count. Last night when it was less than a quarter full we left after waiting more than a half hour for simple sandwiches. I've noticed that the manager who had been there many years is no longer there and hasn't been replaced. The hostess indicated it was new cooks. The waitress said there was only one person preparing food. Don't actually know the whys but the result is a decline in food value and service. But, the result is loosing our business.",

It was quite possibly the worst gf bagel I've ever had. Dense, dry, sweet - nothing I would want in a bagel. The frozen bagels like udi's are far superior. The low fat cream cheese was good though.    Then there was the gf chocolate rugulah. It looks like rugulah but doesn't have the right consistency. I think they try to make up for it with sugar... It was like a sugar bomb went off in my mouth.  But it wasn't horrible.  I would try the sugar cookie instead- at least that may work out",

I was first introduced to Chompies when my employer (government municipality) had breakfast catered by them. The catered breakfast was absolutely delicious. It included waffles, eggs, bacon, homefries and bagels. However, whenever I have visited the restaurant after and ordered the same breakfast items the taste and quality just did not measure up. Today I decided to order an omelette instead. It was the worst omelette I've ever had. It was very bland and lukewarm as was my wife's food. And the salsa they served with was just awful. I have had way better omelettes at IHOP.  I just decided to eat it and made up my mind that I was giving up on Chompies after that. They are completely overrated. On another tip the manager that was walking around the restaurant with the baseball cap and curly hair just did not present as being very hygienic.  I was disgusted when I saw him outside in the back smoking a cigarette and then moments later walking around the restaurant serving water and reeking of cigarette smoke.",

The reason Im rating this place 5 stars is for the service. Chompie's is always very busy, especially today. Our server Laura though was the best. She was very nice, attentive to detail, and polite. Its hard to find service like this and considering a college town makes it that much better. A handful of great breakfast spots in tempe, but because of the service I will still make this one my go to!!!!!!",

I ordered the potato salad as the side and that was really good, too. But how good the food tastes is pretty much the only thing going on for Chompie's, I think. The service was a little slow, and the food is kind of pricey. Also, the pickles they gave us at the beginning gave both me and my boyfriend maaaad stomach aches. If I ever go back, I'm definitely staying away from the pickles.",

    "text": "the night that preceded my first experience at Chompies was one that I wouldn't boast about; a night where sons forgot about the way their fathers raised them, a night where the bank had questioned whether or not my finances were being exhausted by me or not (I assured them that my $418 transaction was legitimate, I couldn't afford to have my debit card blocked this night), a night where listening to Justin Bieber was enjoyable... I was roaring drunk by 8:30pm and had consumed about fifteen caffeine pills to make sure I stayed up all night. before you begin to judge me let it be noted that I came home early from work the day before to discover my girlfriend of three years laying in my chambers with a man I considered my friend, Adam Levine. I couldn't be completely cantankerous; he is probably the most handsome man ive ever had the pleasure of meeting, I believe I offered him one of my extra tickets to the Cornelius Brothers concert before he had left (he respectfully declined). back to the night... not only was I absolutely intoxicated, but my attitude had reached a recalcitrant level, so much so that I had Stone Cold Stunnered the police officer that was directing us into a cab home. I heard later on that the officer I knocked unconscious was on his last shift before retirement, he had been concussed and humiliated all because of me. When we returned to my home I couldn't fall asleep because of the shame... I called my mother and confessed what I had done, but when I checked my call log the next morning I noticed that I ended up calling my seventh grade math teacher Mr. Dini instead of my mother (the call was thirty-seven minutes long). the morning had felt worse than the night; my mouth begging for just a drop of Dasani purified bottled water to which there were none left in my home. my colleague had mentioned Chompies so we gathered ourselves as best as we could and went mobile. when we arrived, we were told the wait was \"about twenty minutes\" when actually we had only held our horses for eight minutes or so. to my great relief there was water waiting for us on the table when we had been seated; I was filled with delight and my parched mouth was no longer an issue, a tear had run down my face at this point. I feasted on Marks Monte Cristo sandwiches which included the finest Boars Head ham I had ever tasted. the fries were fried to perfection and my much needed water was refilled consistently. it is clear that I will never have another prime first experience like the one I had at Chompies. I had attempted to change my last name to Chompy but the state of Arizona did not approve. if you're in need of an impeccable restaurant there is only one that comes to this careful mind, and that restaurant is Chompies.",

There was one man, one pan, individually making all of the eggs. It took beyond forever. It is now 8:33 am and only half of the team has been fed. They forgot some orders. We have a game at 11 am. The whole team is mad, coaches are mad. I repeat, do not bring large groups here for take out without calling in. Our team will never come here again.  Update, been an hour and a half, waiting on 7 more orders.  Fire the cashier, she's an idiot.  Officially been here for  an hour 45 minutes, I'm the last one to get my bagel.

I got the Egg White veggie omelette with a side of fruit and a gluten free roll toasted with veggie lite cream cheese. DELISH!  I enjoy the gluten free rolls here. The gluten free bagels are good too, but I think they might use too much xanthan gum which leaves me feeling bloated.   They have a separate display area offering gluten free baked goods to go. I bought the four pack of gf black and white cookies (for my mom, of course. That's my story and I'm sticking to it! LOL)  By the way, they were pretty darn good!  My only negative is that the restaurant could use a fresh coat of paint and a little sprucing up. I will be back for sure :)",

Basically any meal you wanted for the day, it is there. Usually they start you out with homemade pickles as a starter. Sometimes the batches are delicious and other times they are very bland cucumber bites.  For breakfast I suggest getting their eggs Benedict. I chose their greek one and was not dissapointed. The serving size was huge and the leftovers were even better. It was even served on this amazing twist of a bagel. Oh my, delicious!  For dinner I suggest the Jewish sliders. They come on challah bread which is made fresh. Sometimes it can be a bit greasy but it is worth every bite.  As for the deli. They have great selections of things you won't find anywhere. I like to stop in for a bagel in the morning. Their bagels are always fresh and the cream cheese is perfect. Not too hard or soft, just right. The also carry different bagels like salt bagels. Crazy, righr?!  Lastly their desserts are amazing! definitely share it or get it to go. I like the chocolate box cake personally. They also have breads and other selections to take home.  I almost forgot about the atmosphere. Around Jewish holidays this place is packed so plan accordingly.the summer is a little dead but it can be chaotic during the school year.",

A large group of us met up for brunch for an alumni/collegiate mixer, previously arranged by one of the collegiates and this Chompies location. We didn't have to wait terribly long since we had the reservation set.   There were about 3-4 servers taking care of our entire group, all whom welcomed us as we got seated. Drinks were quickly ordered and provided. Our food took awhile to bring out since they tried to serve everyone at the same time, which didn't happen.   In the meantime, I kept behind one of the menus to further peruse- holy wow is it expansive with breakfast and lunch offerings! While we waited for food, one of the managers came by and asked us about our fairly large group. Like the service, he was kind and very welcoming.  I ended up getting eggs Benedict with hash browns. I'm a huge fan of their hollandaise sauce plus avocados and the hash browns. Although it was a large portion of food, I managed to eat it all- no shame - since this was my first meal of the day. In total I spent maybe $15 for everything- great price for the time and meal.",

    "text": "I spent one Friday night in Phoenix and when my friend suggested eating here I was excited, because I love chompies. Sadly, this did not live up to previous experiences at other locations.  My daughter ordered a bowl of the matzoh ball soup, I got the roast chicken dinner and my friend ordered the pastrami sandwich and specified that she wanted to pay extra to get it extra lean.   Problem one - they were out of matzoh soup. At 6ish on a Friday night. When our server brought me my salad he said that it would just take a couple Minutes for them to heat some up. So does that mean that they were defrosting previously made and frozen? That's a no. Plus it wasn't a couple minutes. It was closer to 20. From when he mentioned it, which made it around 30 minutes total.   Problem two - my chicken was DRY. The mashed potatoes were basic.   Problem three, which was biggest - my friend did not get the extra lean meat she asked for. The manager came over and very rudely told my friend that he and the chef had taken apart the sandwich in the kitchen and felt the meat was fine and she needed to order something else because he didn't want to make her another sandwich for her to refuse. My friend commented on how it was fine for regular but she had asked for extra lean and had been willing to pay. The manager agreed it hadn't been that and said he would make that, but no apology for their mistake or his initial attitude. When he brought back another sandwich Itnwas only slighter better.  I'm only giving two stars instead of one because of the server. Even though my friend was obviously unhappy and I was annoyed by my daughter not getting her food in a timely manner, he kept coming to check on us and stayed nice. A lot of servers would have assumed they would get screwed on tip so not bother or just been to afraid to come by but he didn't. And he offered us comp dessert as an apology. My daughter got a hamantaschen and was thrilled.",

Chompie's has an overwhelmingly large menu and the service by many young college girls that they employ as waitresses is very eager and friendly. The food has always been good and the price is fair because of the overwhelming quantity of food that you receive.  We stopped in yesterday for lunch after visiting the ASU Art Museum for Family Fun Day. My wife had a large bowl of split pea soup, the kids split a chicken fingers and a chocolate-chip bagel and I had the Mitch's Brooklyner sandwich which is a three layer sandwich consisting of pastrami, corned beef and brisket on rye.  The other thing I love is that Chompie's is one of the few places that still sells salt bagels which are my favorite.  Now I'm not Jewish and I'm not from New York, so I'm sure that there are those who would disagree, but Chompie's is far and away the best option for a deli and bakery that I have found in the Valley.",

I had Dave's Deli Benedict. It was good. The corned beef hash was cooked perfectly and I loved having latkes in place of english muffins. The hollandaise sauce was just okay and the eggs were not all the way poached. The hash and latkes definately stole the show on it. I subbed the fruit for the homefries and got a standard fruit cup filled mostly with melons. I also got a brownie for the road and enjoyed it at home later that day. It was DELICIOUS! Perfectly moist and rich. The rest of my table seemed to enjoy their food and despite a hoard of flies interupting our meal, we all ate well.   I wish the service lived up to the food. I felt like our server was annoyed with our presence. She also forgot some of our drinks but we didn't remind her later. And once we asked for the check, it took another 15 minutes to get it so we could pay. I'll definatelly give the place another shot. Maybe the near end of the Sunday brunch was just bad timing.",

    "text": "What's the matter with Chompie's in Tempe?  That's always my question and I just don't have any answer. We've eaten at this Chompie's three times and we're always disappointed. However we've eaten at other Chompie's, most often the one in Chandler, and we're stuffed and happy. I don't get it.  We went with a group of Yelpers to this Chompie's because it's close to Gammage and we were all attending the opening night production of Fiddler on the Roof. So I suggested JewFood. Now, being an east coast Jew, I have certain standards which, frankly, aren't easily met in the desert. But they're not met at this Chompie's at all.  I phoned at 3:00 that afternoon to give them a heads up since we were expecting twelve people (we wound up with eight - you know how Yelpers are). I gave them the count, the time and made clear that we had a time crunch, needing to be out of there by 6:00 - 6:15 at the latest. When we got there the table wasn't ready.  We were seated fitteen minutes later and I told both the host and the server that we were attending the theatre and needed to eat and get going. Our food arrived at 5:45 or 5:50. I can't say for sure which it was. Had a hard time getting more pickles, I never got the lemons I asked for, sauces had to be requested repeatedly. And the food was nothing to write home to Bubbeh about. My extra lean corned beef was fatty and chewy and my daughter's patty melt, requested with extra onions came with a mere four pieces of onion. She asked for more but they didn't arrive until she was nearly done eating. I would have contested the extra charge for those onions but I had to get going or risk losing the opportunity to park in the Gammage lot. From the rumblings I heard around the table, we weren't the only disappointed diners in our party.  Now I've reviewed the Chompie's in Chandler <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/chompies-restaurant-and-bakery-chandler\">yelp.com/biz/chompies-re...</a> and gave it five stars. So the problems clearly aren't pervasive, in my opinion. If we'd had time we would have gone to the Chompie's in Chandler or the one in Scottsdale but the Tempe location was five minutes from Gammage. Oh, well. I'll consider this my farewell address. I won't be back to the Tempe Chompie's again.",

Got there and split an Original Slider dish with my brother, 3 sliders with brisket and the potato pancake (which just takes like a hashbrown, was expecting more, maybe a little more crispiness). And we also upgraded to the delicious onion straws and it came with a tasty gravy and I think also some chipotle, which I couldn't stop eating. $11.99 + $2.99 for the onion straws  Tried some Hot Pastrami on Sourdough sliced bread, it was... eh. I thought I read that the pastrami was supposed to be really good but I might have read wrong or something. I guess we found out the pastrami was steamed later, so thats why the pastrami had a weird texture and not too much flavor, but oh well. Came with choice of potato salad or coleslaw. $7.99  Also tried some Lovey's Oreo Cheesecake just for the hell of it. The temperature was cool, I prefer it colder. But not bad. On the menu it was $5.25, but they charged us $4.95.   Also came some pickles. The service was nice and quick.  All in all, decent food, sliders were the best part, great service, I probably won't be back since I'm only here for a week, but at least I can finally say I tried it.",

Had the meatloaf dinner and a knish. It was so good that the people sitting next to me asked what I'd ordered so they could get the same thing. I was seated and waited on immediately. The order was correct and literally was on the table in less than 10 minutes. My glass never went empty. The difference was night and day over yesterday's experience. I forgot to get the server's name but he was exactly what a restaurant server should be. This is the level of service I'm used to from Chompies. I was in and out with no delays whatsoever.",

I was seated in a booth next to a few older guys.  Later I found out one of them was the manager.  They were very loud and boisterous.  One of them yelled across the room to get his friend's attention.  One was also dropping the F bomb repeatedly even with ladies in the immediate area. Did his mom not teach him any manners?  Apparently not.  I asked to speak with the manager and told him their behavior was unacceptable for a restaurant. I was mistakenly charged for six desserts after having just one.  Server corrected my bill but the extra wait made me late back to work. Probably going to be a long time before I go back to that restaurant.",

The hostess took us into the center, very noisy room, & when we asked to be seated in a booth away from the large party, she said that she couldn't because they didn't have enough wait staff to cover our table in the quieter section. We asked to speak to a manager to see if they could make an exception, & after waiting for several minutes, the hostess came back, & told us that the manager wasn't going to come out, & that the manager told her to tell us that if we didn't want to sit at the  table offered next to the large party, we could leave. Of course, we left, & will never go back. Wrecked our afternoon.   P.S.  We have been to the Chompies at Chandler Mall many times, & have always had great food and service.",

The Chandler location puts whipped cream and carmelized pecans on it; it didnt have it here and my sausage was like a hockey puck.  Other orders - Happy Mouse pancakes with bacon and Nova Lox. The kids' pancakes didn't have whipped cream and their bacon was extremely overcooked - basically burnt.  We had to ask to have the bacon re-made.  The lox did not come with capers, as it is at the Chandler location; we had to ask for that too.  At the end of the meal,  the Chandler location also gives the kids a cookie - not given at this location.  We ended up buying it as we left.  Chandler location is above and beyond in presentation and service.  Maybe we're spoiled at the Chandler location, but  it's a much better bang for the buck.",

    "text": "My last review focused on Chompies lousy service. Now I'm writing another review to expose how inauthentic their food is. I grew up in Jewish New York and have to tell people in Arizona that Chompies does NOT represent the luscious mouth-watering cuisine that has compelled famous Hollywood film directors to fly from LA to. New York just for a sandwich! Their rye bread is dry and over yeasty and sliced twice the appropriate thickness. Their chicken soup has more salt than a Christmas Ham. Their corned beef is not Jewish style First Cut but corned beef Round like you would find at the steam table of an Irish bar...leathery tough and baloney like in flavor. I could go on and on and on... If you're homesick for New York, do NOT go to Chompies because you will miss it even more after attempting this piss-poor imitation. They've got all the right visual decorations and menu items if you were shooting a movie about Jewish delis, but their food is MOCKERY that will disappoint anyone who's ever eaten at a real Jewish deli in NYC or NJ.",

    "text": "C and I met my New Jersey buddy here on a Friday afternoon. 1:45ish. The place was almost empty. I can't imagine people waiting in line here as some reviewers have mentioned. Seriously? Wait in line? Anyways. My buddy gave it a 4 star. His review is around here somewhere. And it does remind me of the Deli's in New York. Well actually, it reminds me of Deli's in a lot of cities. This restaurant is quite large, lots of tables and booths. Also, a large patio. Plenty of seating. Our hostess was pleasant enough. Sat us in a booth, told us who are server would be and headed back to the check-in stand. Our server was fine. He did fail to mention anything about \"All you can eat Fish & Chips\" on Fridays though. And it was Friday. Hmm. Well, to be fair, he didn't really mention anything other than the standard \"what can I get you to drink?\" We got our drinks and ordered our lunch. My friend S ordered a Signature sandwich; Times Square New Yorker with Pastrami. $15.99. This sandwich, as shown in the pic is NOT worth near 16 bucks. MAYBE $12.99. And that's being generous. His comment when we were leaving was \"Definitely not worth the price\". Hmmm, yet he still gave it a 4 star. I ordered a Signature sandwich as well, Wendy's Favorite. $14.99. Now, as you can see in the pic, there was A LOT of Turkey. Over 13 oz. (I weighed the half I took home, 6.6 oz.) Since as you can see it's kind of impossible to eat as it's served, I took one roll of Turkey off and put that in a to-go box. I took the other roll of Turkey and cut it in half and put the sandwich back together with that. Well, I also added the lettuce, red onion rings and tomato from C's Cheeseburger plate which turned it into a nice sandwich. The bread I will say was sad. Falling apart, flattened. Definately nothing special. And what's with the potato salad being served in a little cup? I'm dining IN. Put the salad ON the plate. Oh, and the potato salad. Hard potato pieces, not a whole lot of flavor. Unimpressed.  As I mentioned, C ordered the Checkered Cab Cheeseburger with Sweet Potato Fries. $8.48. Again, not worth the price. The patty was smaller than the bun which was nothing special, kind of a flattened sesame seed bun. Plus, the kids meal does NOT include a drink. So, add an additional $1.99 for a child's drink and you have $10.47 for a kids meal. How do people with kids afford this place? I didn't realize until after we left that his meal was supposed to come with a Sprinkle Cookie. It didn't. The $2 bump in price for his meal was for the Sweet Potato Fries. They were good and a decent portion. Not sure if they're worth the $2 price bump though. The total bill for the 3 of us with 20% tip was $59.41. That's almost $20 each. The list of restaurants that C and I could go to for $40 bucks and have a great lunch or dinner is HUGE. Chompies is NOT on that list.  I love the disclaimer on the Gluten Free menu that states because of the possibility of cross contamination, Chompie's can't guarantee that the Gluten Free friendly items are 100% Gluten Free. So what's the point? I guess \"Gluten Free\" sounds better than \"Maybe Gluten Free\". Do people with a Gluten sensitivity mind playing Russian roulette with that? I assume it's not as critical as a nut or shellfish allergy 'cause that would not be good.  Tip:Kids under 10 eat free on Tuesday with minimum $8 adult purchase.",

Bobka Crumb French Toast.  I'm a sucker for French Toast!  It was good, but just a tad bit soggy with all the toppings.  All 3 of my friends ordered the chicken and waffles due to the rave reviews.  Unfortunately, one of my friends had to send hers back because it was lukewarm.  The other one felt the chicken and waffles wasn't authentic due to the use of chicken fingers and didn't like the cheese and corn added to hers.  *Shrug* Looked good to me.  The waitress was such a sweet girl!  So many choices! I'll have to come back!",

I will say though... I love their baked goods.",

    "text": "My first thought upon entering Chompie's, \"what a neat little restaurant\". It's a sit down restaurant, diner style. It's a bakery. It's a deli. All in one.  Right after being seated we were served our drinks and a plate of pickles and cucumber pickles (yes, I know all pickles are cucumbers but these were halfway between still being a cucumber and a full blown pickle). Odd but a delicious and surprising appetizer.  The menu is expansive... I was overwhelmed. I was originally craving a sandwich yet after quickly scanning the menu I noticed there was not a single veggie option. Sad, I moved on and quickly found 3-4 other entrees to decide between.  I finally settled on ordering the Israeli Couscous Fitness Salad *see picture*. It was HUGE and delicious. The lemon infused olive oil dressing was perfection. And I love that it came with a bialy as I badly wanted to try one here. If you are curious it's like bagel only not... it's a yeasty soft centered, crusty on the outside roll. A staple in Jewish and Polish dining. My friend ordered the Fitness Omelet which came with choice of healthy side and a bagel or bialy of your choice. She and I both enjoyed our meals and finished each bite.   Being a NY style Jewish Deli, I knew not to expect too many vegetarian choices,... there are however a few options, they accommodate special requests, and there is the daily soup which is vegetarian chili.  I was also impressed at the Polish-esque  entrees, I did not try since nothing compares to my grandma's cooking in that department.  Service was friendly and attentive even though the place was quite busy. As a UofA alumni, I could have done without every single server wearing ASU gear but I was in their territory after all.",

Maybe if we visit again, we'll have a better experience...",

    "text": "I'm still a Chompie's fan, but this last time it was just a little weird.  I stopped in for a late lunch with the MIL on a beautiful sunny day.  This Chompie's was hopping, and despite a nearly full parking lot, we found a spot up close.  Walking in we were seated quickly on the patio.  Our server soon appeared with menu's, and with an over-played Brooklyn accent, she took our drink order.    The MIL wanted to get just a sandwich, but the server insisted they don't do \"just sandwiches\"  Wife says she will take the MIL's side of fruit.  From this point, we hardly saw our server, until, of course, the manager started serving us.  Then she was all about checking in several times.  But, I digress.  The manager delivered our sandwiches, and somehow Miss \"I really am from Brooklyn because you can tell from my accent\" interpreted giving the side of fruit from my MIL's dish to my wife as splitting the MIL's sandwich and delivering half of the sandwich a bowl of fruit to each of them.  Whatever, we worked it out ourselves.    I had a half-sized Brisket on multi-grain (which looked more like whole wheat) and chose Coleslaw as my side.  What I got for a side of coleslaw seemed like a joke.  I had also asked for some mayo on the side as I know Chompie's Brisket runs on the dry side.  My side of mayo was larger than my side of coleslaw.  The wife had a Belgian waffle with strawberry topping (yes, strawberry, as in one strawberry cut up) and a giant dollop of whipped cream.  She enjoyed it without much comment.  Despite these oddities, we had a nice lunch and it was a decent meal.  Yeah,  I would go back, but maybe to a different location.",

    "text": "Triple D brought me to this restaurant, and told me to try their sliders, which I did. First, the restaurant has a lot of space on the inside, even though it doesn't look very big from the outside. The staff seemed pretty adequate, but I was sort of disappointed on my food options.  There were these hushpuppy-like appetizer things that we tried that were breaded on the inside, and they were a little bland, but the dipping sauce made up for that for sure. I think they're similar to cheese-filled wontons, but more breaded.  I had the ham sliders with fries for my entree. They were actually good when I tasted them. I wasn't expecting them to be that good based on the presentation. This, however, is a healthy meal and a good choice if one is not planning to eat a ton of calories. I would say that you could make those at home too.  They also offer dessert, but we didn't have any. I did enjoy how this restaurant looked on the interior. It reminded me of an old school diner sort of place. I would definitely come back and try something else if I ever make it back to Phoenix.",

There's so much here I want to try, from fish to skillets and burgers. I settled on a Corned Beef and Cabbage with two sides. My dad got sweet and sour cabbage rolls. While we waited they brought us pickles to knosh on. When my corned beef plate arrived, I was stunned by the quantity. There is a LOT of food on there plates! The cabbage was never ending and soft and delicious, the beef was not fat or greasy and there was just a ton of it, seriously, felt never-ending. My sides include GIANT broccoli and lots of it- steamed and fosh, and a potato pancake with dipping sauces.  The food was almost too much- I couldn't finish the broccoli as I was just too full. My dad's delicious sweet cabbage was plentiful and he could not finish his garden salad side.  We were unable to make room for the various cookies and desserts and baked goods available, which means I will have to return to a Chompie's Deli soon!",

This is a busy location and I feel they have lost sight that they are in the SERVICE business.

    "text": "Well we thought we found a great breakfast place a few months back. The first encounter was fabulous, good waiter and good hot food. Drinks refilled without even asking. We have now been about 5 times and I believe it has come to an end. The second visit they totally screwed up my order, my husband was served and the waitress stated they made mine incorrectly and it would be right out. 20 minutes later I still had no breakfast. We tried to get someones attention several times finally talked with the kitchen manager and the first thing he said was I don't like to make excuses and then the next thing out of his mouth was the excuse that a huge party was there so that is why my order took so long. I stated that's odd as everyone else sitting around us ordered and received their meals in a very timely fashion. So to this morning, I ordered very basic, 2 eggs scrambled, hash browns, bacon extra crispy and a bagel. The eggs were not hot and not cooked all the way, the has browns were half raw cold and not crispy at all. The bacon flimsy not crispy. The bagel suppose to be toasted was not at all. Its took 10 minutes to get someones attention to have it toasted. The waiter never came to see if everything was to our liking. He finally came by and dropped the check with out a word.  My husbands toast on the other hand was over-toasted and his food was not hot at all.  I heard the couple behind us also complain that the toast was a little to toasted. Someone came around to refill drinks once, she filled my husbands water and then said I'll be right back with a tea for you. 20 minutes later she brought my tea we were ready by then to head out the door. I also observed the young hostess constantly running her fingers through her hair and then she would get drink and banana bread for new arrivals without washing her hands. Health department would surely frown on that one. Good bye Chompies.",

The food took about 30 minutes to come out, which is longer than normal for breakfast. When our food came out, my eggs were burnt, not soft scrambled, and were sent back. My husband's eggs were soft scrambled, but super runny. Overall, the food tasted fine. The bagels were the best, of course.  To finish the experience, it took a while to get our check and boxes.",

However, I got the Adele's Asian Salad today and I wouldn't really recommend it.  Not enough to knock off a star, but here is my take...   It is enormous as all their food is, and served with two huge parmesan breadsticks. I thought the chicken was extremely protein-y (stick with me here, like when meat is over cooked or reheated).  Mine didn't come with the crispy noodles it was supposed to and I thought the asian dressing was very thick, heavy and not very delicious.   If you plan to take half home, be sure to order the chicken on the side since it's covered in a sauce and the salad won't keep. A better option would be to order no chicken. :)   I'll still be back, but I wouldn't order that again.",

I order the two eggs any style breakfast along with turkey sausage. Well, let's just say that was $12 bucks wasted. Buyers remorse for certain. Hash browns were not cooked. Had only a slight crisp around the edge and tasted a bit raw. Super greasy too. I ordered scrambled eggs and there was still some runny eggs on the top. This is gross. The toast was decent but chewy. Who wants chewy bread? Seriously. Then the last bit...the turkey sausage. Well, they sat on the eggs and had runny eggs underneath. After swiping this excess off, the sausage was okay. Nothing to waste a couple extra dollars on. In fact, I recommend leaving them off the order. I offered to share and no one wanted any or willing to cook this in the microwave. This was my first experience eating here and will also be my last. Just wish I made a better decision to spend $12.",

I typically come here for the Jewish sliders but every now and then I mix it up and get something different. But those sliders? Phenomenal. The beef is so tender it basically falls off the sandwich. The rolls the come on have the perfect amount of sweet to compliment the saltiness of the meat, cheese, and gravy. The little potato pancake they put on the sliders gives a nice crunch and compliments the flavors of the rest of the slider perfectly. Oh man and the brown gravy?It's definitely something I'd smother my food in on a daily basis if I weren't trying to watch what Im eating.

    "text": "If this was a restaurant that strictly focused on just their sliders, then I would give 5 stars easy. But there is some serious menu bloat that confuses a lot of people and worst of all Chompie's is not very good at making all of those items.  I brought two of my friends who never been there and they were very overwhelmed by the menu. They knew the sliders were obviously good but they wanted to try the other options first and just have a jewish slider on the side  One of them ordered a fried chicken plate and the other a salmon (off of the section that highlights \"New York's Favorites\" so you would assume as a customer that Chompie's was good at making them), and both of them were terrible. Both were overcooked and dry while the sliders were excellent, telltale signs of people in the kitchen who weren't that experience in those items at all.  So yeah, as a reviewer you have to judge Chompie's as a whole. You can give 5 stars for the jewish sliders, but you might trick unintentionally trick people into coming to Chompie's and potentially have a 1 or 2 star experience. Having a bakery /restaurant combo inside is very cool and I've never seen anything like that, but the restaurant part needs to renew their menu to their strengths.  Streamlining and having perhaps maybe 10 or so of their best items is much better than to have the 40 or 50 choices you see on the menu.  Off-Topic: In a perfect world, I wish that Chompie's branch off into becoming a fast food burger shop and compete with the In'n'Out's and Chik-Fil-A's with their sliders. I can only dream.....",

It was piled high as advertised for $16.00. The meat was tasteless. It came with cole slaw, I've had better slaw at any fast food place. There wasn't even a pickle. Do yourself a favor and go to Goldman's if you crave roast beef. My wife ordered corned beef hash. It was mostly potatoes, and topped with cheese. She ate half of it and bagged the rest. She will probably toss it even though we almost never throw out food.We decided to buy a loaf of rye bread but the five loaves they had on the display rack all had expiration dates of yesterday. I inquired if there was fresh bread  and the deli counter guy brought out a loaf dated three days from today. We bought it. We had planned to buy a knish but after our meal changed our minds.

Other than that little bit of confusion I had a great experience. I got a pastrami sandwich that was piled SUPER high just like you would get out east. The pastrami was cut a bit on the thinner side, but it was VERY good. I got a side of potato salad that was also pretty good but nothing to call home about.   Service was very nice... I couldnt decide between the corned beef or pastrami but the girl behind the counter said to go with the pastrami. The wait was not long at all for my food. I took my to go order outside and ate on the patio since it was a beautiful night. If I am ever back in the area I will definitely be coming back, maybe for some breakfast too since they had some good looking bagels and such.",

    "text": "Finding a place that offers a \"selection\" of gluten free options can be difficult.  Some just consider \"it comes without bread\" as qualifying as gluten free.  Chompie's delivers on options that fulfill that longing for gluten foods that are usually off limits.  I haven't had waffles in years but this morning I enjoyed four petite Belgium waffles with turkey sausage and OE eggs.  My husband had a massive French omelet that will suffice for lunch later. :) We had a long wait but considering it was a holiday (Father's Day) this was to be expected.  The wait for a table was in line with what the hostess told us.  The waiter was upfront that the day was very busy but had coffee and juice to us in a few minutes.  Our meal was delivered in a reasonable time.  Will definitely be back for lunch and dinner.  Our waiter was very personable and made the experience all that much better.   Service:  five stars Staff interaction: five stars, honest and upfront about wait times Wait: four stars (only because it was a holiday)",

I would think Chompies could provide a better price point on other items. Food and service are great,  just still in disbelief about cookie price...rising toward $20.",

But in October when ordered for pick up and they said it would be ready in 20 minutes it was not which wouldn't have been a big deal if they didn't make us wait an extra hour to get our food that we paid for. While we were waiting we thought it was taking way to long to get our food and we kept asking and they said it should be out by now.....we'll where is it?!?! After they told us to keep waiting and we were there for an hour they said they found our food and it has been sitting on the counter for 40 minutes..... are you kidding me by that time the food was cold and the pancakes were soggy they didn't even offer to make new ones instead they gave us a 20 dollar credit for when we return next. While my boyfriend and I didn't want chompies till recently we called to see if we can use the 20 dollar credit and they said no because it has been over a month. I get that they have their policies but they never said we only had a month. If they would've told us that in the beginning I would be fine but there customer service is lacking",

When we got our orders, our soups were cold, and we were given the wrong salads. My sister received a plain Caesar side salad instead of a full deluxe dinner salad. I received a rocket salad without dressing. My sister also ordered an order of home fries which she never received. The waitress came out at the end of our meal and said \"the kitchen is busy so I canceled your homefries\". We were disappointed as we had been looking forward to this. After we got our bill we were still charged for the fries which we never received, our waitress proceeded to tell us how this was a \"shitty\" shift and then gave us a couple cookies to makeup for the fries we were charged for. Good food but atrocious service. And the meal ended up being $65 for the 4 of us, only ordering 3 small soups, and 2 salads. (Included the charge for the fries)",

Eggs overcooked, hot pastrami not hot, corned beef that embraced huge areas of fat and bread that, when touched, crumbled to pieces making our sandwiches look like they were the victims of the running of the bulls at Pamplona .  Noticed other people complaining about similar problems.  The kitchen was totally \"backed up\" according to our server.  Not a valid excuse for a restaurant that has been in business for years.  We complained to the manager who was apologetic and gave us some free pastries but the experience was very disappointing.  Won't be chompin' at Chompie's again.",

They had a little bit of everything for all types of customers. I thought it was cool that they had a bakery and a bagel shop combined inside the restaurant. I ordered he Fiesta Omelette which came with beans, beef chorizo, avocado, onions, tortilla chips, cheese, and home fries and a bagel of your choosing. I thought that the food was okay. It was definitely good portion size for what you paid for. The chorizo was overbearing to the rest of the food. The cheese was put on top of the Omelette which was fine but it literally covered the entire Omelette which made it seem like I ate more cheese than I did egg. The home fries were amazing and the blueberry bagel I got was toasted to perfection. The reason I'm giving it a 3.5 was due to the service. The waitress that attended our table kind of forgot about us and didn't really check in to provide us napkins or refills. Man vs food has also visited this place which means you should definitely come and check it out.",

Our server Terreck  was attentive, anticipated our needs before we knew what we needed and frankly the nicest server we have had in a long time. He definitely elevated our #FirstTime Chompie experience. Keep holding it down Terreck were coming back and asking for you!   We ordered the western sliders with seasoned steak fries and 1/2 Ruben , matzo ball soup and Cole slaw.   Western sliders were amazing! I'm a brisket girl and this was tender, lean and flavorful! The bread was enough to stand up to the slider and not weigh a lady down.   The Matzo ball soup did not sound appealing to me but the flavor profile in that soup was like nothing I have ever tasted before. Don't make the same mistake I almost made... try that delicious soup!!   My guy ate every morsel of his sandwich, with a little spicy mustard he verbalized it's perfection. The Cole slaw did not disappoint either!! It was Creamy, light and crisp. It was NOT over dressed and WAS delicious!",

    "text": "I've been to chompies 2x before and remember the food being decent. So this past Friday after running errands with the family, we decide to try chompies.   It was pretty empty inside. A guy comes and delivers water and then we wait. And wait. And wait. Finally about 10 minutes later our waitress comes by with straws and asks if we're ready to order.   J's order - Monte Cristo  C's order - a kids slider Mine - buffalo chicken sandwich App - Holy Pierogi  Now never having pierogis before, i can't say if these were good or not. But first impression, not ordering again.  Pretty much bland mashed potatoes in a dumping.  The Monte Cristo was greasy and very cloying. No balance of sweet and savory. Like ordering diabetes for dinner. J ended up only eating half of a half and was done. The manager did replace it with a hot pastrami, which J said was excellent and he should have ordered originally.  The kids slider - the waitress didn't ask what type of slider and C was automatically given the Jewish slider. He ate the slice of brisket off the slider and the fries.   My buffalo chicken sandwich. Not as described on the menu. A piece of grilled chicken, not fried, so huge that it was 2x the size of the bun. The chicken must have had sauce dumped over it because it was so sopping wet the bottom bun disintegrated into a mushy mess before I even took a bite. And the blue cheese was missing. I ended up eating a few bites and had had enough.   Service at the table was lack luster. Took 20 minutes to get the check. And the manager seemed irritated that we didn't like the food.   Oh and apparently dinner time is the perfect time for doing maintenance in the restroom. Going to take C to the potty, i had to ask the 2 workers to leave. Then returning later to use the facilities myself, i again had to ask them to leave. So forget trying to wash your hands properly. Unless i wanted to hopscotch over the materials/supplies.  I will say the counter/bakery guy was outstanding. His customer service - A+ Counter purchases -  Cheesecake - Fabulous. Nice texture and not overly sweet Alligator - Fantastic. If a bear claw and baklava had a baby, it would be an alligator!",

    "text": "This is a tough one to review as there was a high point but several low points.  Plus:  Gluten free offerings - Gluten free brownie was excellent! Onion roll was pretty good too, although it had a large air bubble. The manager at the front stated only gluten free offerings were onion rolls and brownies, this is at the tempe location. I had thought there would be more gluten free options as indicated on the Chompie's website.  Cons: Halfway stale bagels. Pretty sure I wasn't given fresh bagels, they were somewhat hard, not soft at all. If they were fresh, they didn't taste it. The grocery store bagels were *better*. This is very bad!  Garlic cream cheese. It has raw garlic and lots of it. This is just a minor problem though, I would just stick to plain cream in the future if I went back.  Because of the old bagels, I wont be returning to this location, but I'll give the Chandler mall location a try.",

    "text": "Went here for Christmas Day lunch with my husband and another couple. Chompie's was featured in The AZ Republic as being one of the few restaurants open. We went at noon and there were already 15-20 people in front of us waiting for a table. Not surprised about this, so we were ready to wait.  Customers kept coming in and tables opened up but no one was getting seated. Finally someone in our party asked what was going on.  They told us that they were behind in the kitchen and not seating anyone until they got caught up.  More people kept coming in to the point where there was no standing room left. People started walking out. We asked if we could could sit down even if we knew we weren't going to get served soon.  Was told no--that's not what they do. Finally a waitress came over to seat us because we had \"already made a fuss.\" Really!!! Is that what you tell a customer. They explained that they were short handed because of the holiday. How about staffing up when you know you are going to be slammed on a holiday??? Food finally arrived. My soup was cold as we're my husband's French fries. Sandwich ok. Other couple seemed ok with their food. Overall, took almost 3 hours to get out of there. Every time someone has suggested Chompie's in the past, I cringe because of their bad service. And this was beyond bad. And the rude, frustrated staff didn't help. Buy some good Boar's Head from your local grocery store and save yourself some headaches and time and make your own sandwiches at home.",

As soon as he heard my name he denied it ever happened before I told him what had happened.  Instead of a deserved apology he claimed the incident never took place, so it was my word against his! Calls to the owners were not returned. Needless to say they have lost all my future business including catering. In contrast I took friends to Joe's Farm Grill last week. The ribs were slightly undercooked. I complained only as a favor to the restaurant, not expecting a thing. Their corporate manager found me and gave me back a full refund on the two dinners I had purchased plus a $100 gift certificate!",

I was a little hesitant as there were some mixed reviews, but we decided to go with it, and I'm so glad we did! We both had 1/2 \"Mile High\" pastrami sandwiches and the pastrami was delicious and juicy. My mom had the combo with a bowl of clam chowder which was thick and delicious. I noticed people complaining about the prices, but found the 1/2 sandwich combo to be more than enough food and quite reasonable at about $10 per person. We also ordered one of the turkey sliders which was actually the highlight of the whole meal. With the gravy and cranberry and that delicious latke all on a soft challah roll. Yum! We didn't experiences the poor services that other yelpers had complained about. In fact, I often gripe about the terrible service here in the Valley and I thought our waiter was exceptional. He was attentive and personable and overall we had a great experience. We will definitely be back! And this time we will save room for some of those delectable looking desserts from the case!",

They have a wide range of flavors from spicy to sweet or even plain. I've only at in the dining area one time over a year ago but I don't remember the food or service so Ill review that another time. The lady who prepares the bagels on the other hand is really nice. But if you dont like a ton of cream cheese be sure to ask for light cream cheese.",

The food is pretty standard (despite man vs. food's claims) but it is a little on the pricey side for what you get.  The bagels are pretty good, and they have a large variety, but many of the things on their menu are pretty meh.  Most of their breakfast food is on par with Denny's or ihop. Nothing special.  Their sandwiches are ok, but I haven't had a whole lot of them, just a couple.  I'm really in no hurry to eat anymore. It'll do if you really must have deli, but don't think you're going to get Carnegie quality knish. This place gets 3 stars for bagels, and 2 stars for everything else... Except coffee.  Coffee gets negative 2 stars at chompies. It tastes like a broken thermometer no joke. Sewage coffee blech!!!!",

    "text": "I just finished giving a presentation and kind of skipped my early morning breakfast. So, I came here for brunch around 10:30 am. I was seated very fast, actually, before I could take my seat some guy said 'excuse me' and left some pickles and a glass of water. Aside from the fact that it was quasi-rude to put something down on the table while I was sitting, from behind me, I thought it was cool that I already had my water and I could try a couple of pickles.  What a big menu. I'm eating on a budget, and for breakfast they seemed to have just a ridiculous amount of options, pretty much anything that's homestyle American was on the menu. I had a peek at the lunch menu too, but I was really only here for the $5.99 'Eggciting' special. They also have just a bagel, cream cheese, and coffee for $2.99, which seems like a decent deal. The waitress quickly took my order, scrambled eggs, jalapeno bagel, cream cheese, home fries, and turkey sausage.  Hold up. Turkey sausage. Really? Yes, really. This is actually what tipped me off to visiting this place. I love a classic American breakfast, but I hesitate to go to places like Denny's, IHOP, and even Mimi's because I always get ripped off because I don't eat pork. I usually have to substitute at these places which kind of destroys the whole classic American breakfast feeling.   Food came out surprisingly fast. It wasn't piping hot like I like it, but it wasn't cold either. I don't remember asking for my bagel to be toasted, but then again I don't remember requesting not toasted either. I'm not that picky on that. The home fries weren't hot either which was a disappointment, because I know potatoes hold their heat very well. Anyways, aside from the warm, not hot, food it tasted pretty good. Eggs were done just to my liking. The turkey sausage was fantastic and had a perfect texture. There are two types of turkey sausage, the smoked sauage that comes in a long link (hot dog texture) and the shorter links with a more ground beef texture (and also apparently patties like they had here). It was seasoned well, cooked well, and the texture was just perfect. The home fries were good and also had a nice texture, there was some crispiness to it, but at the end all I really had left was extra crispy chips.  Given my experience, I can only do a 3-star. I was really excited to try this place out and I'm certain that if my food was a little bit hotter it would be my favorite breakfast place. Its a shame it wasn't hot because I'd really like to come back here and try other breakfast items, they have a really interesting sounding chicken fajita omelette.  Also, I feel that its worth mentioning that the pricing here is very diverse. There is stuff from $5 all the way up to like $15 per person. Check menu before you go.",

The brought out some 'fresh' pickles as a starter for the meal.  The pickles tasted like cucumbers.  They had not even started the pickling process yet.  I only ate them because I was starving at that point, but normally I would have passed completely.  The service at this restaurant was downright embarrassing.  Our waitress was in pajamas...I am not joking.  She came to our table two times, one to take our order and the other when she finally dropped off the check (after hunting down another employee to get it).  When we showed her we had a Groupon, she acted as if we were asking her super tasking, almost a personal favor.  We received more service from the other staff than our own waitress.    The portions were really small, especially for the price.  11-13 bucks for a sandwich, I expect it to be decent.  I have been to MUCH better sandwich joints that were more affordable.

The breads are really good as they make them themselves - I noticed the buns on the burgers and sliders are definitely better quality than the typical delivery buns other restaurants have to choose from. YUMMY hot pastrami on rye!  Prices a bit high. But I will say it's a LOT of food, and easily creates another meal to go, or two of us share one! Atmosphere: Love the NY murals all over the walls, complete with subway signs. If I were from NY, I'd feel at home again.  We have no complaints. Everyone has been friendly, service timely, and no problems at all.  TIP: GREAT matzo ball soup, one of the best around according to my Jewish friends.",

    "text": "Okay. I LOVE this place but they need to seriously change the way they handle carry out orders. I'm Jewish and I found this slice of heaven after newly moving to Tempe and I couldn't have been happier. I go here all the time, hesitantly of course because I know they will screw something up. Don't worry, they always do. They're lucky their food is so good and that I love it so much.  If you dine in you're fine. Enjoy! But carry-out diners beware! (This is the reason for only three stars.) It's like they need two registers at the deli. One for people placing orders and one for people picking up. Do you know how many times I have been behind families ordering food, one person ordering dozens of bagels, all while looking at my food that I can see the steam going away from getting cold. I mean it's painful. Please fix this, Chompies. Please. Maybe 50% of the time there's something wrong with my food. But it's also not fair because I'm picky and often change lots of things. Regardless, the two or three times I've said something the person at the deli has either a) not cared or offered to fix anything. b) tried fixing it herself and she did it wrong/weird because she's not the cook or c) took it back and brought me a new one! All-in-all I will continue to eat here because it's just too delicious. I am sincerely hopeful Chompie's will read this and fix their carry out issue though.",

    "text": "Sunday morning, the boyfriend and I wanted to get breakfast at our favorite spot, Chompies. I knew it was Late Sunday morning, so we didn't mind a bit of a wait after riding our bikes down and asking for a table inside. Hosts were great as always, quick to seat us. They have people that make sure you get ice water right away...  Here is where I started to have a problem. Two waiters zipped around the tables behind us, in front of us, next to us. A table sat AFTER us got coffee, orders placed, etc. We waited patiently, still, not even drink orders. (Let me also say, I'm a waitress and I know servers can get busy) So we thought they didn't realize who's section we were in, the guy or the girl. We waited some more. I watched and flagged someone down, letting her know we hadn't been helped yet and just wanted some coffee. She said she'd let our waitress know. 5 minutes, she gets our food order, I asked for a cup of coffee. 5 minutes later, still no coffee. I got up and went to the front, nicely asked if we could sit somewhere else because our server might be new or too overwhelmed but I just really, really wanted a cup of coffee.   They moved us, I still had to wait another 5 minutes for someone to bring a coffee cup and creamer. Here's the part that angered me.... They Still had the same waitress bring our food and bill over 20 minutes later. I really should have asked for a manager, but we love their food and I understand people can be new/make mistakes/etc.  Food was good, so we left happy after the whole ordeal. What made me decide to log on and write this review was that same night, I ended up getting pretty sick, guessing it was the food. I don't think I'll be going back to Chompies anytime soon.... Which makes me sad, because I loved their Gluten Free Bagels...",

    "text": "Three of us feasted on the Jewish sliders with onion strings, a pastrami sandwich, a corned beef sandwich (both Ken Witover's), a Philly cheesesteak, and a bowl of Matzo ball soup. Prior to coming here, I didn't think I'd spend $27 for dinner, but that's what it came out to be. Oh well, I think it was worth it.   The brisket from the sliders was a bit dry, but the side of gravy helped that out big time. On MvF, the challah rolls looked like they'd be dry and bready, but they were actually really soft, sweet and enjoyable. But my favorite part of the slider was the potato pancake. I'm sure it doesn't hurt that I love potatoes, but these pancakes were crispy and flavorful.     As I ate the slider, I couldn't help but wonder how many I'd be able to eat in thirty minutes. Could I eat 12? The answer is: HECK no. I think I could get to five... MAYBE six, but nowhere near a dozen. I wouldn't even bother trying that challenge.   The pastrami sandwich was surprisingly good. If you've been following my recent quest for good pastrami sandwiches, you'd know I prefer thick, hand-carved pastrami, but the pastrami here reminded me of Canter's pastrami in LA... thin (but not too thin) slices of tender pieces of meat with good cole slaw and dressing.     The corned beef wasn't as good though; too dry for my liking. I'd recommend sticking w/ the pastrami.   The cheesesteak was good, but it still doesn't come close to the ones in Philly (duh).   The Matzo ball soup had more veggies than I'm used to, but the broth was good and I loved the Matzo ball. I think I can eat that every day.     Good food, good service. I'm a happy camper.",

The last time we went here, my boyfriend ordered The Breakfast of Champions with two whole wheat pancakes and when they brought out the pancakes, we noticed that they were significantly smaller than usual. Furthermore, we had seen other customer's pancake orders that went out with huge pancakes. We said something to our waitress and they brought out new full-sized pancakes, which was no big deal. We just ate there tonight for dinner and both of our meals were not up to the usual Chompies standard. I ordered the sweet potato pancakes, and the bottom pancake was completely burnt. My boyfriend ordered the all-you-can-eat chicken and dumplings, and for some reason they had smashed the dumplings down into the dish, which they've never done when he's ordered that before. Then on his 3rd round of the chicken and dumplings, they gave him such a skimpy portion of dumplings that it didn't even cover the bottom of the dish. Even worse than that, instead of giving him a chicken breast they put sliced turkey on the dumplings! I'm not sure what's been going on at this Chompies location lately, but we've never had any problems at the other location on Cactus Road.",

I  have been going to this place since the day I moved to Phoenix (my stepdad took me there first day move into the dorms..aw) and now I feel I have graduated to the \"adult\" location at Shea Blvd. and 92nd Street. I don't know if I am shrinking, but the portion sizes at this restaurant are becoming astronimical! Everytime I have friends in town we hit up this place - and it seems to leave everyone satisfied, despite their craving. See example:  I wanted breakfast - so I got the skillet (egg beaters scrambled, with country potatoes, turkey bacon, onion, etc. covered in gravy...mmm)  My cousin wanted hot wings - which were actually delicious  My bud Gilbert got a tasty double bacon cheee  Ashley got a breakfast burro...  As you can see, wide array of selections on the menu. If you are so hungover that you can't take off your sunglasses or even begin to try to put a comb through your hair, then the Tempe location is for you. I have found that the Scottsdale location has an average age of about 45, and it looks like they have all gone on a really nice morning bike ride or hike on Camelback and stopped by Chompies on the way to their afternoon pilates.",

Turns out Chompies is more a place to see and be seen for the college kiddos instead of an actual awesome diner.  I got french toast, boyfriend got pancakes.  My toast was burnt and the pancakes tasted like eggo microwaved pancakes. Im also not a food returner, if its edible, ill eat it, but this was pretty bad. I asked the waitress what was up and she very snootily retorted \"thats how it comes\".  Um . . . looking at the dude at the table next to me's golden, perfectly cooked french toast i asked her \"are you sure?\" She rolled her eyes and walked off, and apparently not to bring me something that didnt look like toxic waste as she didnt come back until 15 min. later with the bill. Oh and PS the home fries are just hashbrown mush with no flavor.  Dont bother.  The food was pretty nasty, the server was kind of mean, and it was so not worth the wait.  Ill stick to Matts downtown until i find another diner.  Bummer since i live in tempe and was really hoping to finally find a greasy spoon closer.",

The staff were friendly and welcoming even on a Sunday afternoon. And the place was packed.  But they found is a great seat on the patio and it didn't take long for the food to start appearing. In fact, the longest time was spent trying to decide what to have because it's all there. And it's all good. I couldn't choose between a corned beef Rueben or a pastrami Rueben and our server suggested they make half and half, which they did! That was I could compare side by side. I won't tell you which I preferred yet... I used my yelp check in offer and got a black and white before lunch. I also had a gluten free brownie for dessert that was amazing! My lunch mates loved their choices as well. An egg and sweet potato dish with cheese was awesome. And of course the potato pancakes delicious. The pastrami!",

I walked in with no expectations or knowledge about this place besides being told that their menu is extensive. IT REALLY IS INTENSE! They kinda have a lot of everything lol  The wait on Saturday morning (St. Pattys Day) was about 15 minutes. We were seated outside on the patio and immediately ordered mimosas to start off our morning right! The mimosas are served in such large glasses I literally thought they mistakenly brought me orange juice.  I couldn't decide which breakfast plate to try so I ordered the Turkey BLT with a side of fruit :P It was pretty damn delicious!!! Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal. GREAT food, good service, fair prices. I cannot wait to go back!",

First let me start by saying they gave me a free Black and White Cookie just for doing a Yelp check-in.  (Look to the Cookie People).  I ordered a Pastrami Reuben with Fries and Coleslaw.  I love a good reuben, we even make them at home quite often.    The pastrami reuben at Chompie's is a ridiculous pile of meat.  I loved this sandwich.  Sure, after you may feel like you'll never be hungry again but that feeling will fade.  The pastrami was warm and fatty and cut perfectly.  I don't know that I've had a reuben like this one previously.  I can't wait for a return trip so I can repeat the experience.  I should add, the coleslaw tasted like a great creamy southern coleslaw so that was a great surprise as well.  The desserts were decent, but even though I waited until later that night to eat dessert, I was still too full to enjoy it.",

Now I haven't tried their matzo ball soup which will be the clincher but I did have their Reuben plate today. Oh my freagin ..... it makes Miracle mile seem like a white castle.  I had the Reuben plate today and it was so packed with meat that I couldn't open my huge mouth wide enough to bite through it and had to kind of lever it in. It was easily 2\" plus thick. The bread was perfectly done .. crispy but not toasted until it makes your gums bleed. The meat .. oh the meat .. it was dripping juicy and just fell apart. Plate came with coleslaw and fresh thick cut fries that were a meal in themselves. They also bring a plate of some very tasty pickles to the table. It was nearly to much for one person to finish and I had to take a couple deep breaths to squeeze in the last few bites and unfortunately left a few fries .. DAMN!  I mean .. heavenly lunch. Highly recommend.  I have since been back with my wife and the food was just as amazing as the first time.",

This is one of the only places I go to that I order the same thing almost every time--the Biltmore Benedict.   We usually also get biscuits & gravy to share, which are excellent!  The food is always great and the menu is huge so it's a great crowd-pleaser restaurant.  Plus the mimosas are nice and big! And even though I've already been here several times, I feel compelled to write a 5-star review this time because the server I had yesterday, Kylie was absolutely fantastic!  She was quick, attentive, and thoughtful; we never had to ask for anything!  She kept our water glasses full, offered another round of mimosas when the ones we had were getting low, checked back to make sure our food was tasty after the first few bites, and brought us a bag for our to-go boxes.  As someone who works in the restaurant industry myself, I really appreciate it when I come across someone else who actually cares about the guests and goes above and beyond.  And the next time I'm in, I'll be asking to sit in Kylie's section!",

    "text": "Stopped in here during a road trip and was not disappointed. The service was amazing, very fast and friendly staff. Cool spot that has been featured on man versus food which is what brought me in. I took on their slider challenge and it was delicious! Challah rolls, brisket, jack cheese, a potato pancake, and some gravy x12 with onion strings. I didn't get to enjoy the onion strings hot but based on how they were when they cooled I would eat these hot and fresh as they didn't hold up. The sliders were delicious. The brisket was super tender which can be a tough cut of meat if you have ever been to a bad bbq restaurant. The whole slider packs a lot of flavor but my favorite part is the crunch in the middle of the slider from the potato pancake. That change in texture doesn't seem like much but is great. Definitely recommend, just maybe not 12!",

Yes, they have a sweets to go counter. They have all of this and they have....drum roll please.......fresh salmon sliders!! Omg these aren't your run of the mill sliders. They are not pressed salmon patties. These are sliders made of fresh grilled salmon filet. So good!! The buns are so very good and soft! Oh, I meant the buns on the sliders ;) no but really, soft slightly sweet buns, cucumber, onion and tomato relish and crispity crisp potato wedges (I substituted for homemade chips) this meal was delicious, playful, teasing, original and filling. I'm sure that all of the reviews and pics are for the signature items but trust me order this!!! Besides that, the ambiance was great. Friendly staff, happening crowd and the wait looks long but not as bad as you think.  To top it of, I scored a day old bag of bagels and rolls for $2.50!!! Hell yeeeah!!  Parking sucks but oh well. Plenty of seating, booths and tables. Food gets to you pretty quickly and the icing on the cake is they bring you house prepared pickles. Yuuuum!Meeeeee!!!  All in all this place is a must stop. Stop in and enjoy the bountiful tastes and smells!!! Can't wait to try something else but the salmon sliders were so good I probably won't.  Hats off to the chef!",

    "text": "My sister always tells me, \"I had breakfast at Chompies.\" Being from California, I have no idea what Chompies is, so I decided to try this place out for dinner.  The table where we sat at was dirty. My brother-in-law had asked the bus boy to clean our table, in which he had a hard time scraping off what was on the table.  My sister took her baby wipes out and was able to get the crust off the table... Not to mention dirty menus. Cleanliness is important to me, so this brought this place a star down from what I would have originally rated it.  Our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable. His name is Dylan. He recommended the chicken schnitzel... SO GLAD I GOT IT! It was a chicken breast covered in a very thin crispy batter.  The chicken breast was very moist.  It came with my choice of two sides, in which I choose the broccoli and potato pancake. The broccoli was perfectly cooked and not over cooked at all. I can also tell the broccoli was fresh and not frozen broccoli that most restaurants serve. Potato pancake was perfectly crispy in the outside and soft in the inside. I had a huge serving, but was able to finish it. =) I posted my picture if you would like to see what I had.   Dylan definitely gets 5 stars for his excellent customer service.  Can't wait to try their breakfast next time.",

For my actual meal I had a brisket sandwich. it was a bit dry since they do not put any sauce n it and the protein bread is pretty spongy-and my boyfriend ordered a sandwich with pulled pork, potato pancakes and gravy- MUY delicious. Service was great and fast, my coffee was kept filled and the waitress even went through the extra effort of finding out how many carbs were in the low carb bread. This is a huge plus for those living a healthy low carb or fitness lifestyle. You can get any breakfast with cottage cheese or low carb bread as a sub for toast and it just made me so happy!   Some other cool points about this place, it's like a legit New York themed and style deli. You can get fresh bagels and bread here ( all of it is effing delicious), fresh deli sandwiches like brisket, roast beef etc. The portions are good, and price works with my wallet. It wasn't too busy on a Sunday morning which is a plus, because when you are hungover, or just starving on a Sunday morning, you don;t want to wait forever to sit and get your grub on. I'll definitely be back.",

I love how large the selection is and the fact that they are really flexible with their menu/choices. Makes it easier for us unfortunate folks who have to eat a strict diet (damn you self image!!)   We had the roasted turkey sandwich with everything on it (minus mayo) and had it on low carb-high protein bread. Amazing bread by the way. It's like \"eating nothing\" as my husband puts it. Only 60 something calories per slice and only 1g carb per serving! You can buy a loaf to go but it will run you about $5 a loaf, but if you go now they are running a buy 1 get 1 free deal.   We also had the tomato bisque, which was rich, creamy, and delicious... Our trainer will not approve of that selection. Oh well! Extra hour of cardio should take care of that.   Overall I enjoyed my experience there. Loved the music too. I'm a big fan of the oldies.   Try to go after 3 pm. If you try to go on the weekend... Be ready to wait 30-40 minutes before 12:00pm. Popular Sunday after church location.",

You get choice of a cup of any soup, small slaw and free pickles and two monster sliders for about 12 bucks. Went back to my roots and also ordered an Egg Cream,, but while not the best (no foam) it still satisfied my youthful craving. Nice staff as well, explaining all about the slider challenge.

In right field was an advertisement for Chompie's, and after acknowledging the hunger, it became all-consuming.  I grew cranky, and my head began to throb.  I was pleased when the game ended in seven innings due to a lack of pitchers or something, instead of disappointed at being denied a full game after coming from so far, but I was got-damn hungry, so I was out the gate and in my rental bee-lining to Chompie's.  The location is extremely easy to get to on the predictable grid-like roadways of Phoenix, and there's plenty of free parking, which starts this visit on the right foot.  The interior is relatively clean, open, and welcoming to small groups or possibly families, with a good amount of seating available.  There was no wait for me on a Friday afternoon, between lunch and dinner.  As much as I enjoy Man v. Food, and challenging everything that Adam Richman does, my track record isn't that great.  That being said, I was tempted to undertake the infamous slider challenge, but the truth is that I've never had the sliders before, so I didn't even know if I would like them, let alone be capable of eating five pounds of them.  So just a regular order of sliders was all I ordered.  When they arrived, I was in awe.  These were no dinky Krystal/White Castle sliders that I associate with the food description slider.  They were larger, fresher, and oh so beautiful.  Before even taking the first bite, my expectations shot through the roof.  And my beautiful god, did they not disappoint.  I swear I was on the cusp of tears after the first bite.  I know I was starving when I ate, but they were just genuinely fantastic.  I want to put a potato pancake on everything I eat from now on, because a combination of the tender meat and slightly crisp along the edges potato pancake made everything make sense.  The gravy only made things better.  Words really can't express just how good these things were.  When I tried, some inappropriate words came out of my mouth.  Despite the fact that it was my first meal on my trip, and I was visiting for just a few days, I knew a second trip was in order.  After the three sliders, I was pretty content, so I don't think I would've been able to finish off a challenge.  But I'll just swear by them regardless, and declare that the next time I'm out in Arizona, Chompie's is mandatory.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch. Large menu, good selection. We were a party of 4, and two of us had a very bad experience with the food, while two of us were satisfied with the food. Matzo ball soup was good, except for the large chunks of chicken bone in it. The meat on the Jewish sliders, as well as the potato pancakes on the Jewish sliders, had WAY too much salt in them.  Regarding the hostess with the awful attitude that another reviewer mentioned, her name tag said her name was Sara, and her attitude with us was remarkably bad. The rest of my party got there a few minutes before I did. When I walked in, she just glared at me (no greeting, no \"Welcome to Chompie's\", no nothing except for the glare), so I said \"I'm meeting some people here\" and kept walking, her response was a snotty \"whatever\" as she turned her back to me. When I got to my table, the rest of my party was still talking about how rude she was to them when they arrived (we had the audacity to ask for a baby seat, and \"Sara\" was not at all pleased about having to get one). I noticed her crappy attitude with other people as she was seating them too, so she seems to be in need of going back to Hostess school (or being given the opportunity to be successful elsewhere, like a dentist's office where people already expect a painful visit).  That said, our waitress was great: good attitude, helpful, attentive. She did a great job, and her tip reflected it.  In short, I had always wondered what all the hype was with Chompie's. Half of us liked our food, so it's not all bad, and the other diners appeared to like their food, but given the bad experience I had with my food and the requirement to get past the Dread Ogre Sara before I can be granted access to the mediocre food, I'll probably stick with one of the myriad competitors in the marketplace.",

I say this because Tuesday is the day to head over to Chompies and eat your heart to death with all you can eat sliders.  While I didn't eat the dozen sliders and beat the challenge, I did beat the price tag by going the all can eat route.  Back to the real point here, the food.  The sliders were pretty damn close to perfection.  The bread was magically soft, the brisket nicely cooked to a tender and flavorful point that melts in your mouth, the potato pancake was just awesome with a crunch creamy change of pace to the texture and the sauce just dead on, not to much that the sliders were soggy.  Like I said, just about the perfect slider. The western were good also, but stick with the original.  Skip the $40 challenge, head over on Tuesday and gorge yourself to death on Chompies awesome original sliders!",

So glad I finally tried this place because the portions are huge, the prices are just right, the menu is deep, it's real and the kids love it since they get a full size cookie decorated with rainbow sprinkles with each kids meal.  The kids had pancakes and mac and cheese and grilled cheese sandwich for brunch and between the juice and the sample coffee cake, they had to take their pancakes home. I had the Athens skillet with eggs, potatoes, archichokes, feta, tomatoe and it was soo good and huge, I ate only half of it and then didn't eat for another 10 hours! The bialy was soft and chewy! My first time. Converted. My husband ordered the french toast and ate all of it! 4 giant, thick slices.  This is the place for the Travel Channel Man vs Food challenge that was featured and I saw others ordered the famous sliders and they were meals in itself.  I see why it's a challenge to eat 10 or a dozen to get your picture on the wall. No way for me, but I'll try one next time. Waited only 15 min and the service was great.  I think I knew this place would be good because they had both a deli and a baked goods case. Takeout, too..A feast for the eyes and the stomach. Cream cheese by the pound.  Chocolate babka! and this wasn't even Christmastime.   I can get babka year round?! yeah! The leftovers eaten the next day and that was even better! Love this place since they guys will love it since it had tvs around the dining area, too.",

When I did get my order of two eggs, potatoes, bacon, and the customary bagel, it was very good.  My companion could not say as much for his grilled cheese on Challah bread.

I have had both the Regular Sliders and the Southwestern Sliders, and both are delicious... Try either, depending on if you would rather your meat have gravy or barbecue sauce, respectively.  I would stay away from their coffee.  Something just does not taste right in it.  That, and they do not provide fresh creamers.    All in all, this is a decent place, with tons of options.

Now if you haven't, this might be just fine for you. Located close to ASU I wonder if they just have given up trying to really show off how good it could be. maybe feeding the students and their out of town parents is just enough for the Chompies Family. But if they do want to attract locals to come in here are some ideas:   Refill water glasses at least every 15 minutes, this is salty food; pickles, pastrami , chopped liver etc...give us some water...and if you see customers sucking on ice with an empty glass take the hint...   give us a nice big bowl of pickles 4 pickles in an a 10 inch dish just looks silly...show us you care like a Jewish grandma and give us a decent amount ....   When you say LEAN it means no big flabby pieces of loose fat dripping off the meat on every side. Lean would be the no visible trails of flabbiness.   Do something about the fries...when the person next to you says , \"they taste okay when you put gravy on them\" you know they are just meh...  If you are giving me fries ,make them decent ..it's not that difficult.   Check on your table occasionally , taking the order and bringing the food and little else makes me wonder why we even need the waitress...I will go take the order and get the food and no need to tip me.... and I refill water glasses.   Chompies has the potential to be more but who am I to tell them what to do?",

We figured it and started to leave about 10 minutes later, and a waitress yelled at us as we were leaving, telling us to pay more attention. I thought that was uncalled for and would have rather been told politely that the restaurant was closing at 8. Maybe she was just having a bad night.   The matzoh ball soup is lousy compared to my grandpa's, but it is the best I've had at a restaurant in AZ.    Otherwise, it's a great place to go for brunch or lunch, has a full-fledged menu with tons of choices, and you get a lot of food.",

The first time we went I got the latkes (yum, best ones I've had that weren't home cookin) and the second time I went for the hot pastrami sandwich (so good)!!  The bread was a little soggy, so if you go for it, do it right and ask for the bread to be extra toasty...  Overall, good place.  I wish we had a nice reasonably priced jewish deli where we lived!!",

We still went religiously, even though the food was hit or miss. About 4 months ago we went and I had the worst experience of my life. I ordered my usual, the eggs benny with smoked salmon... when they dish was brought out i could smell the fish, i knew it wasn't fresh. After arguing with the waitress she took it back and brought me a new one, which still smelled aweful, I took a few bites and couldn't finish it. 45 minutes later i experience the worst food poisoning of my life... I called to let them know to not use that fish, no idea if the message got to the kitchen... emailed them a complaint and never heard a word. All hope is not lost though! we found a new local breakfast place that we love, so maybe it is for the better. You will be missed Chompies....",

So I have waited a couple months to go back and may never go back again.  We watied forever to get our food, about 45 min, when i approached the hostess to check she said no, this nice young waiter said he would, and poof it was out.  Not to mention they were still wrapping the silverware by grabing the fork by the prongs and not the bottom part, big health violation.  When i did get my order the waitress gave me the wrong bagel and she forgot the home fries.  I am seeing a pattern that one should sit in the male waiter section because they are not bitchy.  It is sad for the waitresses, because i have been know to tip a 100% of my bill since breakfast is so reasonable.  I don't think the owners and managers that the attitude of the young ladies is so poor and that reflects badly on the resturant.  I don't think i will go back to this one for a long time.",

We did the divide and conquer thing so the waitress brought extra plates, but let me just say that is probably the best french toast (or is it freedom toast) I have had in a long time.

Considering all of my visits to Chompie's are always 6+ months apart, I can't really comment on the service. In my memories, it has been hit or miss, but mostly hit.

My friend who has gone there with me has indeed ordered red meat sandwiches and has been satisfied as well.

HELPFUL HINT: If it's not a traditional Jewish food, don't bother ordering it at Chompie's. Their menu is full of \"American\" food items that they don't execute very well, not surprisingly.

Despite the parking lot being packed, we were seated right away, served great food, the man was able to watch some football, and I had plenty of people watching to do.    Finally, a flexible menu, none of the same ole'.   Big servings, definately splittable, and the cake looks wonderful.  Next time, we will grab one on the way out.    4.5 stars.  All that's missing is crepes.",

I would be embarrassed to tell you how many times I have been here, it's probably in the hundreds and I have tried just about everything I had any interest in eating. The Breakfast Chomp-adilla would probably be the favorite, just a glorious, gluttonous way to begin a morning (or early afternoon). Portions are huge and it seems like everything comes with a bagel and cream cheese on the side if you'd like it. The deli sandwiches are huge and high quality.  Also tough to beat the waiter named Mitch, who is just the prototype New York sarcastic wiseass, and who might be the funniest guy on the planet without even trying.",

    "text": "We went to Chompie's after church on Sunday and arrived about 12:30.  The only reason that I am not giving Chompie's five stars is because after being seated, the wait for the food was long.  However, don't let that stop you from going.  The food is fantastic and worth waiting for.  I had bagels and lox and can't say enough about the smoked salmon.  It was tender and delicious.  The dish also came with sliced tomatoes (and they were actually juicy), cucumbers, red onions, lettuce and olives.  Other members of our family ordered the Biltmore Benedick - that tasty salmon on muffins, topped with eggs and a creamy white sauce - and the Chicago hot dog which has every condiment imagineable piled on top.  We ate tons of Jewish dill pickles while we waited for our food and asked for another plateful which was delivered to us ASAP.  I enjoy this Chompie's more than the one at Paradise Valley Mall because it has more personality.  Be sure to check out the baked goods behind the bakery counter!  They also sell day old bagels for a discounted price that would still taste great toasted.  Our waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and checked on us often.  I haven't eaten at very many Jewish delis in NYC, but this is as good as my favorite deli in Philly.",

    "text": "We visited at about 5pm on a Wednesday.  We were seated immediately, but there was a slight wait for a wait-person.  From there, I think the word \"wait\" is worth noting.   We ordered our drinks-----although the menu stated that they had tonic, the server said they didn't and two of us settled for club soda instead.  The drinks came after about 20 minutes or so.  Then, we ordered  fairly simple  dinners:  a pastrami, a reuben and chicken strips.   Mind you, the place was not particularly busy.  After about 35 minutes, a fella came out of the kitchen with our dinners and said he appreciated our patience.(All the time the server was no where to be found).  One meal(the reuben)was not as ordered, but after waiting so long we were afraid to send it back not knowing how long a replacement would take to be delivered. On the plus side, the food was quite good, but the \"hot Pastrami\" was not hot...nor was the reuben.  Then, finally, comes the bill.  Surprise, surprise!!  The server was there to take the money.  When a complaint was delivered about not getting the reuben as ordered, the server took a little offense, but said that for the inconvenience we could pick out a dessert \"on the house\".  But, she could not bring it over.  We'd have to go to the counter to get it.  After waiting another 10 minutes after telling the counter person what the server had said, he just shrugged and said we'd have to \"wait our turn\".  I really think they had no intention of delivering on the promised dessert, but we'll never know.  We left,  Never again for the Tempe location!(Note:  We have not had this problem at 2 other locations).",

Brother in-law asked for soup instead of fries but was an add of $3 on top of his $15 Brooklyn sandwich.  Sliders could have been served with more gravy but I didn't dare ask for more or another $3 add. The prices were on the high side ($145 for 6 adults and 5 kids),  Overall this was better than grabbing fast food before a flight. Free Bagel for Yelp check in is a nice touch!",

While the atmosphere is comfortable and the service was average, there's not a lot that makes Chompie's super special. The eggs benedict I ordered was good but not extraordinary. The portion sizes and prices were equivalent. The service was complimentary but expected at such an established joint.  Experience Chompie's at least once but don't pull in thinking you'll have the best breakfast of your life. Comfortable, easy, and average.",

Chicken was flavorless, over cooked and dry-- I had to ask for sauce  or gravy because it was so bad.  Server was not sympathetic and did not alert the manager.  I would have expected an apology from the manager or some consolation.  By the way, this was 4:45 on a Sunday afternoon so it was not too busy to pay attention to quality.  Lastly, we didn't order beverages and the price was still $31 for two \"dinners\"....Pathetic for value.  Will give it a chance again for breakfast but dinner or lunch is a \"no go\"!",

    "text": "This was a tough review for me.  I wanted to give them higher marks, really I did.  I went in with low expectations.  I've had Jewish food on the east coast, OK?  Things were looking good right off the bat.  We were seated and water and a tray of pickles appeared as our tushes hit the cushions.  My lovely wife picked up a pickle, crunched off a bite, gave a surprised expression and said, \"Not bad.  I'll be the Jew-judge.\"  She is Jewish, after all.  Fair enough.  I thought the pickle was pretty good, comparable to some I've had on the east coast.  That's where things started to go awry.  It took between 5-10 minutes before anyone came over to get a drink order.  We ordered several items to share.  My wife and I shared a corned beef sandwich and fries with gravy.  The kids shared matzo ball soup, blintzes and a latka.  I ordered coffee.  The soup came first and it was very good and authentic.  Coffee?  \"Oh, right.\"  My water has been sitting empty for a bit.  The rest of the food arrived pretty quickly, and my coffee arrived.  Water?  \"Oh, right.\"  The blintzes were very good, especially the cheese.  The corned beef was good, it passed muster as authentic.  Fries?  Good.  Brown gravy?  Fine, but it had an odd flavor.  Latka?  Very good.  Water?  \"Oh, right.\"  \"Can I get a refill on the coffee?\"  \"Oh, right.\"  The prices are high.  The sandwiches are available whole or 1/2.  $13.xx for a whole corned beef is a bit high, but it is big enough to share so that's a plus.  One sandwich and one order of fries was enough for 2 adults.   The fries were $4.xx    Coffee?  \"Oh, right.\"  I don't appreciate having to ask for every refill 3 times.  I would probably write it off to just one server having an off day or something.   In summary:  Good kosher-style food, a bit pricey.  It will hit the spot when I'm craving a corned beef sandwich.  The service was spotty.  So what may have been a 4 star review has been knocked all the way down to 3 stars.    Coffee?",

Some of my favorite things to order there are the bagel skins, tuna melt (rye and swiss-best evereverever), and the french toast. I don't think I've ever had a bad experience here.   The only qualm I have is when I come here for brunch and order a mimosa. The so-called \"large\" mimosa is a joke. It's a regular size drink you'd get anywhere else.

However, one of the hostesses was very rude- couldn't catch her name but she was a very thin brunette. We were originally seated outside on the patio but realized soon enough that it was covered in little ants. When we asked to be reseated inside she rolled her eyes, let out a big sigh and mumbled \"ya\" and pointed to a table (didn't even walk us over to it!) As we ate I continued to watch her mannerisms and attitude with other customers only to find that she was very rude with them as well. She would walk much farther ahead of the guests, turning around with an annoyed glare and stance if they were not right behind her. She never once smiled. Perhaps she was having a bad day but I was still dumbfounded by her attitude and lack of customer service skills. Hopefully management takes notice because there's a lot of restaurants with great food but great customer service is what makes a place stand out from the rest.",

Really really great, or you wait 45 minutes for your food. But it's the food and the reasonable pricing that keeps us coming back. We're from Boston and like many Bostonians,  we prefer to support mom & pop places rather than restaurant chains when we can. The food is great! There are a lot of options (traditional, simple, Jewish style, etc).  My one biggest complaint/suggestion for the star's rating: PLEASE, for the love of God, come up with something better than throwing hot coffee over a cup of ice for \"iced coffee.\" As an iced coffee lover, there is nothing more infuriating than that. It's Arizona, it's hot, and people will drink it if you serve it! That alone would bring me from 3 to 4 stars.",

The location is perfect and convenient parking. I'd come here for all the people who want a all American restaurant and have a huge family to feed lol.   My food was okay. I ordered a jalapeno chicken sandwich. It was meh. Lol I hated the sauce and the beard was nothing special, but this is nothing to do with the 'quality' of the sandwich, just not my preference. Anyway, nothing big about this restaurant that I'd tell others to come check out.   Restaurant needs an update? Or maybe I'm too hipster for it haha.   Anyway, overall: service was really good and the food was meh.   Would I go back? Probably not. There are better restaurants that offer the same stuff.   Sorry chompie",

    "text": "Disappointing. Why? I'd never been to the actual Chompie's before, I'd just purchased my weight in their everything bagel's from my local grocer. And one time, my aunt brought a huge to-go container of Israeli Couscous Salad to a holiday dinner.  When friends decided to meet here for pre-concert nosh, I was hesitant. Can't we go some place with booze? Oh, Chompie's serves booze? ok then. I'll go.  Ambiance: -not too far slung from your Red Robin/Swanson's diner-esque chain restaurants.  -hardly any tables on a weekend night  Service: -our waitress was relatively polite, I hate that they have to wear those lame uniforms that remind me of my days at Applebees. They could use an upgrade. -food took a little while to come out, especially considering there was no one in there.   Food: -disappointed that they stopped selling the Israeli Couscous Salad. In fact, there was little on the menu that I expected at all. No couscous, no quinoa, very little promotion of their bakery/deli items. Lots of traditional chain restaurant foods: sliders, buffalo chicken, burgers, iceberg lettuce salads, etc.  -I ordered the Greek salad, half size. Amounted to a full large dinner plate (plenty for two meals). No meat will still run you $8. -FYI: \"gluten free\" menu insert has very little on it, but at least they offer. -other people in my party ordered sliders and a cheesesteak, which looked pretty yummy. Again, big portions, everyone took home leftovers. -next time I'll try some of their \"starters\" which more resemble traditional deli items: matzo balls, mini potato pancakes, knish, and a pastrami on rye.  I'm not sure I'd make it a point to stop by Chompie's unless I was really hankering for a good pastrami. Which isn't out of the question.",

    "text": "Giving 1 star was very easy.  They practically begged me to do it.  We arrived at 2:15. Sign on door says they'll be closing at 5 pm. First thing I thought was they allow their employees to watch the Super Bowl.  How nice!  Wrong. Turns out they would be closing in 2 hours and 45 minutes for a private party. Read on, because that point becomes relevant.    The young hostess (she knows who she is AND so does the manager) walked us back to the very last section of the restaurant to a booth.  We passed other sections filled with people. Not over-crowded, though, as it was 2:15 pm.  The booth had a large pitcher of tea and two large pitchers of water on the back of it, right where my head, HAIR, and shoulders would be literally inches away.  I told her I wasn't comfortable with that and I'd like to sit elsewhere. There was an empty booth 2 seats away.  She scowled at me. \"I have no where else to put you. We are full.\"  Really?  What about there?  \"Everything else is reserved\".    Everything?????   \"Yes, everything\".    So we left.  I called the manager from my car.  He apologized and asked us to come back.  He said HE, TOO is uncomfortable with drink pitchers being placed by his customer's hair, but he is a new manager so he's let it go.   He also said she should never have refused to seat us elsewhere. Props to him for not being rude like his front-line greeter.   Chompie's only gets one chance to be rude to us, so we declined to come back.  The treatment by the NASTY hostess, as well as the GROSS practice of storing open drinks where any customer's hair could dangle (Health Department, are you reading this?) was such a turn-off that I think the experience is worthy of sharing.",

    "text": "\"As if they have good Mexican dogs at the Jewish deli! C'mon, girl. Haha.\"  Kat P. of Yelp Phoenix  Anybody got ice for that burn?  She told me!  RIP J-WoW.  *Z-snaps, hairflip*  We came here to take advantage of the $8.99 BOGO hot dog deal, with the purchase of two drinks, for spring training.  We got two Sonora dogs (one with fries and one with coleslaw), a chili cheese dog with fries, and the corned beef hot dog with fries.  Overall it was okay.  The Sonora dog was disappointing but still tasty.  I was expecting beans, mayo, tomatoes, et cetera.  It fell short of all that but it was still decent --- just don't call it a Sonora dog!  I was pretty amped up with getting the Baker's Box special they had going on for $10.99 which includes thirteen bagels and two 1/2lb tubs of cream cheese.  I also redeemed my Yelp check-in offer of a free black and white cookie.  That thing was huge.  I prefer the Chandler location more than this Tempe location as it was both not busy yet service was a bit slow.  At least the location is clean and the eats are decent.  This is where Adam Richman of Man vs Food did his slider challenge so it was pretty neat to pop into the same spot where Food won.",

I would definitely stick to sliders when coming here because when we came for their Spring Training BOGO hot dog special, we were disappointed. It's not the most exciting chili dog and their Sonora dog was a joke. Then again, you are asking for a Sonoran style hot dog at the Jewish deli so what was the wife really expecting, right? Haha! They both tasted alright but we were expecting more since we love their other offerings.   For such a slow Saturday, service was okay at best. I think I'll stick to their Chandler location.   Also, don't forget your Yelp check-in offer for a free Black & White Cookie.",

My wife had the huevos rancheros which was not on the gluten-free menu but didn't appear to contain gluten. We also had an everything gluten-free bagel with blueberry cream cheese that was very good for gluten-free.  We were happy with the breakfast and will be back again",

It may not be the best place for bagels, but for a humble Mexican like me who doesn't have expertise on the matter, this was the best I've ever had. I only wish they had some habenero peppers on deck so I can get a sweat going while munching on my bagel. #chompsquad #chompafarian #makeamericachompagain",

When you order a sandwich, they fill it stacked to the sky with meat.  I had a corned beef that was juicy, sliced thin on rye with mustard.  Definitely comparable to what you would find in a New York deli.  The decor is all about New York with pictures of the NY subway all around.  I also noticed that they have matzo ball soup, kreplach, and potato pancakes - items you would not find just going to a sandwich shop around here.    Overall, it was a little expensive and the service was a bit slow, but I'll be back again to try something else.  It looks like they have a good selection of bagels and pastries in the deli adjacent to the dining area!",

I also ordered a side of their home fries and man, was I happy camper!   I've always been obsessed with Chompie's bagels but most often come in for a sandwich/lunchtime. We will absolutely be back for breakfast again soon because it was SO good and you get so much food for the price. I do hear they can get BUSY on weekends so just keep that in mind when making plans! But I promise you, they're worth the wait. ALSO, check in on Yelp for a free black and white cookie. And let me tell you, they taste like they're off the streets of Manhattan. So fresh and authentic. Their baked goods are seriously dreamy as well.   I just love this local, family-owned and operated business. See you again soon, Chompie's!",

Portions are really really large so keep that in mind when ordering. I wonder if anyone is ever able to finish a full portion.   Chompie's is not only a great sit down place for breakfast, lunch or dinner but also has a huge deli where you buy their delicious bagels, baked goods, flavored cream cheeses and best of all the smoked meats!!",

This place may be delicious, and their sandwiches may be huge but $15 (yes fifteen american dollars) for a sandwich is crazy. You could get full here off of the half sandwich but then again you're already over 10 dollars in at that point so what's another 5 to double your meal.   Really though, the sandwiches are good but they're nowhere near good enough that I will ever want to go pay that kind of money for one. They were piled high with good meat but I've had better elsewhere for half the price... If they were priced ~10 dollars for a whole and ~7 for a half I would probably come here once every now and then if I was in the mood for pastrami but as is I'll never be back.   I don't remember the service being anything remarkable either way so I'm leaving that part out of the review as I only did take out. I also hear that they have good breakfast specials so I might give it another shot for breakfast but I can't make any promises as nothing about this place really caught my attention enough to come back.",

But that's all they make. I Googled \"gluten-free tempe, az\" and came up with a website compilation of G/F places nearby. Chompie's was one of them, so I investigated.  I asked the kid behind the counter if they had gluten-free things, and he said yes. I asked what they had, and he pointed to a stack of unlabeled cookies in plastic containers. That was the first oddity--that they were unlabeled. G/F things should be labeled (for allergy purposes). The second was that was ALL they had, aside from a frozen hamburger bun (see Fry's frozen food department for better and cheaper buns). The ONLY good thing about the cookies were that it was $2.50 for 8 of them. They were mediocre at best. (again, see Fry's for better cookies). I am disappointed that there is no one in north Tempe/south Scottsdale/east Mesa that has cornered the gluten-free bakery market. Otherwise, I have to drive to south Tempe to get a decent cinnamon roll.",

I had the half sandwich and soup. Sandwich being pastrami, and soup being chicken kerplach.  One issue I had was with the temperature. The soup was hot. I mean molten lava hot. And my sandwich was warm. That temperature for the sandwich on it's own probably would not have given me pause, but contrasted against the extreme heat of my soup, made it less desirable. Make those sandys hotter, Chompies, and I will have nothing to complain about.  Definitely want to come back for the all you can eat sliders, they looked awesome!",

    "text": "Kind of overrated - I'm feeling like if I went there 5 times straight in a single week, I might even downgrade them a star.  I second the other Yelpers in saying that everything looks absolutely amazing the first time you come here - the menu is a haven of Jewish deli classics and can be a bit intimidating to the hungry individual wanting a taste of everything.  Servers are super friendly and hustling around toting enormous portions of delicatessen delights - the place has a really cozy feel to it.  Tucking into the food, though, nothing is mindblowingly good so much as straddling the line between yummy and blah.  My standard of a cup of matzoh ball soup, half a pastrami sandwich and an egg cream was a nice meal, but I had just hoped that little things could have been better to elevate the meal to the next level.  Case in point, the matzoh ball itself was bursting with the flavor of schmaltz (chicken fat - essential for a great, traditional matzoh ball) but the broth was so flat, I found myself seasoning my soup at the table.  Or the pastrami - can a girl get a little moister pastrami and a little spicier mustard?  Maybe I'm being a nebbish, but everything deserved a B- when I so hoped to give it an A+++  Jewish sliders are worth a try only once - it's an intriguing combo of brisket (bland), latkes (crispy and light), jack cheese (wish it was swiss for some reason and gravy (delicious!) on challah rolls that goes down smoothly but then proceeds to expand in your stomach like someone's blowing up a balloon in your innards.  Not so pleasant.  I officially know why Adam Richmond had to throw in the towel on Man v. Food - it's pretty aggressive how filling those little suckers are.  I guess if you are a champion to the likes of Joey Chestnut, go for the all-you-can-eat sliders action.  Mere mortals, stick to the basics and leave with your pants intact and not bursting at the seams.  Straight meh, says I.",

Jewish Sliders = mini challah rolls stuffed with brisket, potato pancake and Jack cheese and served with a side of brown gravy.  ($10.99)  The brisket was juicy, the potato pancake was crisp and tasty and the brown gravy was the perfect dip. Ask for a side of au jus to make it even better.

    "text": "This place got our business simply by default.  We originally had plans to meet friends for weekend brunch at another restaurant nearby.  The first choice restaurant had a wait time of 90 minutes for brunch.  That sadly wasn't acceptable with a small child.  Our friends suggested calling Chompie's to ask about their wait time.  We did so, learned the wait was only 20 minutes and headed there.  On the drive over, I remembered my only other experiences with Chompie's were at their Scottsdale location, and both experiences left me underwhelmed by both the food and the price to value ratio.  Having limitations on our restaurant budget, we like to feel we got real value for our hard-earned money.  Value to us does not mean filling up at the feeding trough that is Golden Corral or thinking fine dining is \"the\" Outback, but we like to feel if we're paying $50 for brunch (WITHOUT alcohol), that it was delicious or unusual.  We could have spent $50 for lunch at Pappadeaux and been completely thrilled.  The best thing about our visit was the nice corner table that gave us plenty of room to be comfortable and enjoy good conversation with our friends.  The food was very lackluster.  Authentic Jewish deli?  Hardly.  Grandma Yetta is rolling over in her grave thinking about their kreplach.  My husband spent almost $15 for the apple pancake with added scrambled eggs and sausage.  I went with a corned beef sandwich, as at $13, it was one of the cheaper options.  We both felt our choices were just meh, the corned beef flavorless and the apple pancake nothing special. Add in a pancake kids meal, 2 soft drinks, tax and tip and we were just north of $50.  Next time, I will have plenty of good suggestions for alternatives that aren't Chompie's.  Sadly, I think they're still impressed that they were featured on Adam Richman's show, which was so 2010....  (By the way, the restaurant has no control over this, but I especially LOVED the table of frat rats kvetching about their hangovers and dropping f-bombs like they were Adderall pills at last night's rager, hello goofballs, there's an impressionable 2 year old boy RIGHT NEXT to you, take your potty mouths back to the dorm room).",

I drive 15 mins just to go get their lox bagel and every minute is worth it because it really is delicious!!",

    "text": "I've just found the perfect slider for me- the turkey slider! It's like a Thanksgiving meal, with white meat turkey, cranberry sauce, and turkey gravy. Every ingredient in this meal is something I love! The challah rolls are perfect, and the potato pancake adds a nice crunch to the slider. I was slightly disappointed that the jellied cranberry sauce looked and tasted like it came straight from a can, but that was a minor setback.  I also tried some of the pot roast sandwich. It was a massive meal, with huge slices of meaty pot roast with good flavor.   I've also tried their bakery items, which are quite good. The cookies and cakes are, for the most part, really delicious. My favorite so far is the mouse cake. I've tried other cute looking mini-cakes, like the frog cake, but the frosting on it tastes a bit strange to me, and there's not enough of the \"cake\" part in it to balance out the massive amount of frosting.  They are also open an hour later now- very nice! (Until 9 P.M.)",

They had every kind of pastry someone from the east coast could imagine.   I ordered the Jewish sliders, their signature dish and it was delicious. The brisket was moist and the challah bread was so soft. Now I see why they chose this place on an episode of Man Vs Food.  The service was fast and friendly and the atmosphere was exactly like a NY deli in the middle of Manhattan. If you're in Phoenix and looking for a nosh you won't be disappointed with this place.",

The service was slow and I'm not sure if anyone was working in the kitchen!  We found out 30 minutes after we placed our order that they were out of Latkes and 2 of us had to reorder our food (out of latkes on a Sunday morning??)  We came specifically for the Jewish sliders!  It was another 20 minutes before we got our food . . .and half the dishes were cold.  The manager came over (finally) and said she'd have the dishes remade fresh.  She let us know with her attitude and tone that she was not happy with us (?)  Ridiculous.  We never did get the items we requested (tea refills, the cream cheese spread that was missing from one plate, etc)  The brisket sandwich is not made with brisket; it's definitely top round.  We should have walked out. We let the manager know it was our first visit.  She gave us a short apology, turned on her heels and walked away.    Can't understand why they are so busy.  Our meals were not worth any of the drama or the wait.",

I was disappointed to not be able to order the chicken matzo ball soup because they didn't serve soup until 11 a.m. But I consoled myself with the salmon lox with all the trimmings on s toasted everything bagel.

She said I think I remember that show And as I recall I think, we both kind o' liked it And I said well that's, the one thing we've got  Chompies has been serving East Coast style breakfast in the valley since 1979!  Located close to ASU Campus this place is packing with tradition and memories.    Breakfast is served throughout the day.  Pick up some fresh made pastries and bagel on your way in or out!  Last first time came I ordered he All American Breakfast -- YUMMY! Crispy bacon, warm turkey sausage, crispy hash browns, and over easy eggs. I'm a sucker for good breakfasts.  The 2nd time I came I ordered the Breakfast of Champions.  Let's just say I wasn't a champion this time around.  I finished my eggs and bacon, but man those pancakes or ginormous!  I think I ate 1/3 even though I was trying to carb load for my run that day.  Eaters be aware; the portion sizes hard HUGE!    The place itself is made like a deli shop.  I don't think much has changed since the open since it seem pretty dated.  It was fun searching for the different Broadway plays painted on the walls which brought back great memories.  Our service was excellent and the waitress seems to know a lot about the large menu.  Yes, not only were the portions huge....the menu itself was HUGE!  First timers I would definitely stay with breakfast.  You can't go wrong there! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "To be completely honest, I had had a bit of a rough go as far as Scottsdale/Tempe dining had gone during my recent weekend visit for Spring Training. Fortunately, that all changed when I walked through the doors of Chompie's Deli.  Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  Excellent on all fronts. Whether you're here for just a quick dessert at the bakery or for a full dining blowout with a big group (which was my case, having walked in 13 deep), Chompie's has you covered, and even our rowdy bunch was quickly accommodated by a friendly staff. Well done. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Having seen Adam Richman fail to take on the slider challenge here at Chompie's, there was no doubt in my mind that I was going sliders here. While you can get three and a side for $12 ($4 per slider), you can grab the 12-slider challenge tray for $40 ($3.33 per slider). Whichever way you go, it's totally worth it. Three sliders is more than enough for a meal and the side is the cherry on the cake. I opted for the tray with half \"Jewish\" and half \"Western\":  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=LXp_5OlR7luoCdbj1HV0sg&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  Boom baby. Fair prices. Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  Wow. Honestly this was excellent. I've had sliders in the past, but nothing like the Jewish sliders here at Chompie's. The meat was great and rolls an excellent compliment, but it was the mini potato pancakes inside that really had me over the moon. They were great plain, they were great with gravy, they were great with bbq sauce, and they were great with garlic ranch, all of which were provided with very good potato-wedge style fries. This was a great experience. Dual Stars Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I absolutely would. Not only does a massive menu compliment fair prices, a great staff and brilliant desserts at the bakery, but the sliders are unlike anything I've ever experienced. Excellent. Star Granted.",

I do like their bread so the hot pastrami sandwich on a Kaiser roll was yummy! You get to choose what bread you want the sandwich on.

    "text": "Chompie's Tempe is our guilty pleasure for all-day breakfast, sliders, fresh bagels, and hearty sandwiches. The menu is 7 pages long, so if you can't find something good to eat here, you might be SOL. If you check their website, you will find over a dozen menus - some are even specific to holidays such as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Yom Kippur, and Passover (just to name a few).  I especially love their salmon tapas, and hubby can't get enough of their sliders.  Chompie's parking is always a breeze here, they have their own private parking lot and also share another lot with some surrounding businesses.  Once you enter the building the hostess is there to greet and seat you. If there is a wait, you can browse the bagel and dessert counter. Everything looks and tastes really yummy. Side note:  the one time I visited the location in Scottsdale, I noticed that their dessert case was far superior. i.e. presentation, variety, and no smudges or questionable smears on the display case. In any case, it's a really minor detail that I think would make a huge difference at the Tempe location.  Service is good. Staff is always super friendly but I think sometimes they try to run with a lighter server staff which can at times really make it hard for them to properly manage their tables. They have a couple TVs in the dining area, and if you ask nicely they will gladly change the channel to the game of your liking (today was Seahawks vs. Cardinals). Overall, our server was friendly and got our order in quickly, and that made us happy!  Did I mention that with check-in, we received a full-size black and white cookie? That thing was huge! Way to sweeten the deal Chompie's!",

It is always a bummer when they run out of your favorite flavor of bagel, but that's also a good thing, right?! The service was super friendly and we didn't have to wait too long for our toasted bagels and coffee. Make sure to ask for LIGHT cream cheese on your bagel, otherwise, I swear, you get enough cream cheese for 3 bagels on top!

They have a wide variety of baked goods and pastries, and my favorite is the black and white cookie (free with a Yelp! check in!)

    "text": "Chompie's is the BOMB!! And they have a cool name too. Here's why I love them....  Okay, so you walk in and immediately notice the huge array of pastries behind a glass display case, along with dozens of baskets filled with fresh bagels lining the wall. And then your eyes keep going down the line and you see that there's actually an entire selection of meats and cheeses to be cut by the pound, in addition to pre-made deli salads and side dishes.  You think, \"Wow do I just order what I want from the deli counter?.... Because I could most definitely find something to eat just from here.\" But then your hostess brings you back into the seating area that has tabled filled with people munching on their meals and talking. You get handed a colossal menu that's busily decorated with New York themed text and taxis. It's about 7 pages long and you're hoping you can finish reading it before the restaurant closes. But it's laid out in a pretty organized way to help you find what you want. The selection of items is big enough to please a crowd. There's definitely something for everybody (except maybe vegans), with a focus on New York / Jewish / deli type of food. Oh, and breakfast is served all day. Bonus points.  After we settled on ordering one of their well-know dishes (the Jewish breakfast sliders) and just a common breakfast dish (the Early Riser), we sat back and took it all in. Lots of New York themed decorations. While we were waiting for our food, someone comes around with a plate of samples of their muffin-type breads. Extra points. We tried the chocolate chip, blueberry, and walnut ones, which were all really good.   Our food comes out about 10-15 minutes later and it wasn't a bad wait at all, considering how busy they are. The plates are 1: huge, and 2: piled high. My Jewish Breakfast Sliders consisted of 2 mini challah rolls each sliced in half and stuffed with a fried egg, a turkey patty, a slice of cheese, and a potato pancake. Boy were they goooood. My meal also came with a side of gravy (a bit overkill) and a side of fresh fruit (a nice touch). The other person I was with got the Early Riser, which is a bagel breakfast sandwich with 2 fried eggs, choice of meat, and a slice of cheese. This also came with a side of your choice. Overall, the portions were really big and the flavors were great! Definitely not healthy, but still delicious, nonetheless.  Service was swift and attentive. The staff was very friendly, quick to respond, and on top of the game. Price point was average too, which is always good. Noise level was a little loud, but not bothersome at all.  I definitely recommend Chompie's to anyone that loves New York or diner style food in a casual atmosphere. I feel like this restaurant is just one of those places that you HAVE to try....and then you might just end up loving it and coming back again and again.",

This is a typical restaurant setting, with full service waiters, none of that order-at-the-counter nonsense.  I was supposed to try the pastrami sandwich on challah, but after reading Wendy's Favorite I couldn't resist.  The sandwich I got had an insane amount of thinly sliced turkey, lettuce leaves, red onions and lite cranberry mayo on cracked whole wheat.  A very good sandwich in theory, but the turkey was incredibly dry.  This could have been fixed by adding more lite cranberry mayo, but the waitress was hard to get a hold of.  For $11.79 it should have been better.   The sandwich came with a side and I opted for french fries.  These were some of the best fries I have ever had.  They were made with high quality potatoes (at least that's what my dining partner told me) and were thick, more like wedges than fries.  Spiced well and complimented the BBQ sauce that I asked for nicely.  I also had a pancake.  It was thick, had a big diameter, but didn't taste as outstanding as I thought it would.  Good value for the price.  As you walk in you see a cart full of day-old breads/bagels for decent prices.  If I ever ate food at home I would have bought some bread, but fortunately I don't have to worry about supplying food for my kitchen.",

    "text": "I came here a long time ago when I was an undergrad, and I remembered liking it, but that was before I knew about Yelp.  Luckily, I swung through on Super Sunday to reminisce about my (recently) passed college days.  A group of friends and I (4 total) rolled in to grab a quick breakfast.  They have a counter besides the sit down area where there is a \"Rush Hour\" menu.  \"Rush Hour\"!  That must mean they get that shit ready fast!  Or it's for pairs of Asian and Black detectives?  We guessed the former.  So my friends and I each get a bagel sandwich.  Nothing very fancy.  It was like eggs, some veggies, and a little meat in a bagel of our choice.  No sweat, right?  It really wasn't even that busy in there (no line, everyone getting seated immediately).  So we sat.  Wandered.  BS'd.  Ogle'd a couple hungover girls stumbling in.  Normal stuff.  But we didn't see shit going on.  Nobody looked like they were preparing out \"Rush Hour\" sandwiches.  We waited.  We pinged the manager, and he said they would be on their way out.  After a half hour, three of the sandwiches came out.  Of course, my sandwich wasn't ready.  Must have been chopping up all those bell peppers...those little guys are so tough!  Or perhaps they were curdling the cheese as I waited!  5 minutes later, my sandwich got there.  My friend brought up the fact of how long it took to make.  Pat: Hey, what's up with taking over half an hour to make these simple sandwiches? Manager: Not really, it was like 15 minutes. Pat: No, look at our receipts.  They're timestamped.  Look at the clock now **It is past 1/2 hour now** Manager: Ok. Pat: That's it?  What kind of response is that? Manager: **no response...perhaps thinking about how he hates life?**  And that was it.  And the sandwiches sucked.  And they gave us the wrong bagels.  Awesome.  And them damn things cost like 5 bucks.  In summary: -\"Rush Hour\" menu is bullshit. -Can't get basic orders right. -Manager's a jerk.  I can't speak to how the sitdown area is.  I enjoyed it a long time ago.  But I wouldn't ever go back with what a letdown this past experience was.  Even if the manager had said \"Sorry about the wait\", I might have wanted to come back.  I wouldn't even want my money back.  But he basically was like \"What the fuck is your problem?\"",

It was soon after moving here from Los Angeles that I found Chompies.... being a regular patron of West Coast heavyweights such as Langers, and even Canters, I was hungry for good deli food and thrilled... at first.    Their food is \"meh\" at BEST and WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY overpriced for the quality.  If they charged 1/2 the price they do currently, this place would be 4-stars.. but don't come up in here trying to charge Langer's prices and serve up Schlotzsky's quality.   Next.",

I have always enjoyed the personal service even when the place is crowded, and expect lots of people all the time.    I can't forget  the Lox and bagels its as classic as it gets.  happy Eating  The menu is very large just like the location in Tempe.",

    "text": "Made it back to my old college stomping grounds after a several year hiatus, and all I gotta say is Chompies, it's good to be back! Why oh why did I stay away so long??  Went there for lunch the other day with the always lovely Gabi K., after I was hit with an insatiable desire to have breakfast for lunch.  We arrived at 12:30 and the place was pretty packed but we were seated right away.  Now, I should probably fess up to the fact that I have been ordering the same exact thing at Chompies for 8 years now, and see no sign of switching any time soon, because it is perfect.  I get the greek omelette with American cheese, an everything bagel, and hashbrowns, and it is an instant party in my mouth.  Gabi ordered a soup and salad combo (which I didn't even know they had since I never get past the breakfast page) and it truly looked delicious.  Seriously looked like one of the better looking salads I've seen around Tempe.  In the business of full disclosure, our waitress did falter with both of our orders.  She forgot Gabi's soup and she did not make the sub to American cheese in my omelette as I requested.  Neither of us are difficult diners though so we rolled with it and continued our gabfest.  What really pushes Chompies over the 3 star line for me is all of the extra goodies in and around the display cases in the front.  Black and white cookies? Check! Real, authentic chocolate rugelach? You better believe it!  And my personal favorite, acutal Wise brand Cheese Doodles!!! Not Cheetos, of Cheese Puffs, or any of that knockoff crap, actual delicious, heavenly Cheese Doodles, my favorite snack of years past when I lived in the Northeast.  You wouldn't believe how difficult they are to find in AZ!   But not to worry, I can get them every time that breakfast for lunch craving hits, and I almost always do.",

Tried their Biltmore Eggs Benedict when I met friends a recent Sunday and I applaud Chompie's inventiveness: lox instead of ham and accents of Havarti atop a bialy instead of an English muffin. The lox's saltiness overpowered the dish however, and I was genuinely disappointed. But it was still edible once my mouth adjusted to accommodate the high salt content. Said friends had fitness omelets & veggie sandwich - all looked & tasted wonderful (according to their reports).  Other faves are of course lox & bagel platter & blintzes. Service is efficient & friendly. Some visits better than others but overall a four-star establishment.",

They have a stellar bakery (which services a bunch of coffeeshops, restaurants, and groceries throughout the valley with bagels, cookies, cakes, etc.) and fantastic deli food, through-and-through.  Their Mile High sandwiches are absurd. Stacked 6-7\" tall, you won't be able to get your mouth around them. Start chipping away from the side and hope for the best.  Breakfast is typically top notch, if a bit pricey. The pickles they bring out absolutely kill me, but that's because I hate pickles more than anything on this earth. The wait can be really bad, even on a weekday--we were seated instantly, but it took a LONG time for the four of our basic food to come out.  On the other hand, the potato latkes, pierogi, brisket, sliders, roasted chicken, matzo ball soup, and basically everything else is DAMN good. Oh, and their bagels are top notch too.  Grab a butter cookie on your way out, or a \"character cupcake\" done up like a Sesame Street character. (The Cookie Monster one is especially meta.)  Ran by nice people with decent service (when it's not slow), you're sure to get a taste of the classic New York deli right here in Tempe.  Oh, and I'm on the Wall of Shame for failing to complete the terror that is the Slider Challenge. Don't even try it.",

I've had both their breakfast and sandwiches and I hate to rate it so low but honestly, I just don't get it. It's all Eh...alright. It's very standard deli food, definitely nothing mind blowing. I think the fact there's an actual deli in Tempe gets people excited more than anything, because there's not a whole hell of a lot of deli/restaurants around.   The menu IS huge so there's a lot to choose from. They have a wide array for breakfast and a lot of healthier options. Unfortunately I've always left feeling like it wasn't worth the money. I got one of their chicken sandwiches and the chicken was overcooked, dry, and the grilled vegetables on top were soggy. I've had the pastrami before, and while tasting okay, it wasn't super-juicy and melt in your mouth. I'm obviously spoiled.  I've been to some outstanding Jewish and Italian deli's in LA- namely Langer's and Philippe's in the heart of downtown. There's so many good delis in the huge metropolises, but not so much around Phoenix. Sorry Chompie's, you just don't do it for me. I like the bloody mary's and pickles though!",

When a place has such a huge, diverse menu they usually don't specialize in anything and everything is just mediocre.  That's what I found with this place.  We went for lunch and it was Packed!  Service was slow which could be from the vast menu choices.  Too many different types of food for the kitchen to keep up with.       I found the restaurant to be dirty and smelled slightly off.  Couldn't really quite place the smell, but wasn't all that inviting.  I had a Cobb salad and while a huge salad, the lettuce was warm and included quite a few brown pieces.  The little tray of pickles that they put on our table were thrown down and I couldn't help but get the feeling that they had been recycled from someone else's table who didn't eat them.  Not sure why, but I definitely didn't touch them, and I love pickles.  Granted, I've only been once, but the experience was enough to put me off and I haven't wanted to try it again.  There are just too many other good options out there.  But I'm sure I will try it at again and I will update if I have a better experience.",

Usually have to wait for a table but the its a great NY Deli place where the sandwiches easily top a pound. I have a hard time trying things other than the Reuben from the menu because its so good other things on their incredably large and varied menu are also very good. I personally don't care for their brisket, finding it dry and bland, but everything else is good.  Of note is their Mile High sandwiches - yes they are stacked high, the pickles are simply awesome and come to your table at lunch and dinner, breakfast/brunch here is top notch, and everyone should indulge in a Yummy french toast at least once - it makes a great desert so save room.  You usually have to wait for a table, especially during breakfast/brunch but its busy all the time. This location can be a bit loud with the college crowd but its not bad.  Dont forget the bread, bagels, and pastires. The rye bread is simply the best rye and can sometimes be found in your grocery store if your very lucky.",

Last week, we had the same blondie waitress that I believe another reviewer refers to - a scraggly haired blondie at that. We got there at 5:00. Scraggly took our order at 5:15. Then we proceeded to wait ... we ate all 5 pickles alloted for our table, drank all of our water without straws, despite the fact that we ordered cokes - which only arrived after they were delivered to another table???  Meantime diners all around us came, ordered, ate and left. Finally I caught Scraggly's attention and asked when we would be getting our meal, as the tables around us came after us and were already served. She replied, \"Those aren't in my section - and it's busy in here today.\"  Not sure what that had to do with anything. It's a restaurant sweetheart, it's supposed to be busy. And anyone who has half a brain, knows that sections don't have kitchen hierarchy. The tickets are prepared in order.  Needless to say, Scraggly forgot to place our order but didn't want to admit the truth. But AHA!!!!! When the bill came, the time stamp on the ticket was 6:07 - approximately two minutes after we inquired about our lost meals.  We confirmed the time stamp as the time the meal was ordered in the kitchen, with the little cashier - Yep, that's how the kitchen keeps track of whose meal gets prepared first.  Sorry Scraggly - NO TIP FOR YOU!!!  Chompies food is not bad but the service is consistently is (BADDDDDD) I'm sure there are plenty of ASU kids who comb their hair and have positive personalities. Chompies needs to hire them.",

If you are into food challenges, they do have a slider challenge that involves a dozen sliders, a pile of onion rings, and 1800 seconds.  Now, I'm not sure how any human being could possibly complete the slider challenge successfully, but kudos to you if you try it.  I was full halfway through my third slider.  Deceptive little buggers!  The lunch line is pretty significant, so plan on waiting for a table (for 5 of us today, it took about 20 minutes), or head in before/after the lunch rush.  The prices are a little higher than I would like, but for a once in a while lunch treat that's close to work, Chompie's is it.",

There were other people sitting outside as well. The hostess said, \"Let me check to see if someone will serve you out there.\" From my experience working at restaurants with patios, if someone wants to sit outside, you seat them outside. Anyways, she came back and said, \"Oh the patio is closed now.\" Since when do restaurants close the patio especially on a beautiful day like yesterday? I wanted to complain, but just shrugged it off. The menu is very large, but nothing looked very appetizing to me. I ordered the caesar salad and baked potato soup. The soup was okay, but the salad was not very good. It was mostly iceberg lettuce and did not have much taste at all. Not impressed at all.",

I was a little disappointed because for $14 for one sandwich with fries, I was expecting something great!  Sorry, this is just way too pricey for just an average reuben.  I had it with pastrami and it had good flavor, but the sandwich could have used more sauerkraut for sure.  The fries were good!  The best part was the deli on the way out, they had bags of day old bagels and bialys for $2.50 and I snagged a bag with some lox cream cheese to take home.  I'd go back for the lox cream cheese, it had chunks of lox and wasn't all ground up like lox spread I have had before.  I wouldn't go out of my way to go back here for a meal that's for sure.",

    "text": "Today I was craving a sandwich but didn't want to go to the typical Subway or Togo's so I decided to check this place out because it is close to my apartment and I had heard good things. Here are my pros:  Ample parking- the lot is huge and I'd be surprised if it ever filled up.  Friendly employees- she may have been a little bit lost but she was super sweet.  Large sandwiches- I was unaware of what I was in for, so I added salami to my turkey sandwich. Needless to say the sandwich ended up being HUGE. I literally had to deconstruct it to eat it.  Fresh produce and tasty meat- the produce on my sandwich was delicious and crisp. The meat was flavorful and as I mentioned there was a lot of it.  Pickles- The dill pickles I received with my order were scrumptious. I could see why someone would say they are salty but I LOVE salt so it was yummy.  Bread- the bread was delicious. I may have to go back and buy some of their sourdough bread to make sandwiches at home.  Cons:  Price- it was a wee bit more expensive than I was expecting. Its like $8 for a small sandwich and $10 for a large. I also wasn't sure I was charged correctly because the girl taking my order didn't seem to know what she was doing.  I still would like to go back and try their breakfast items, which I heard are fabulous and also to buy the \"half moon\" cookies they have. (If you are from upstate New York you know EXACTLY what I'm talking about). Oh and I want to try the Ultimate Slider Challenge one of these days.",

Took awhile to get them and when they arrived my friends were nice and creamy with a few chunks of ice where as mine was full of uncrushed ice cubes and large chunks making it impossible to use a straw and requiring me to chew.  I ordered a half corned beef half pastrami sandwich for my meal. Again it took a long time for the food to get to us and i understand they were busy but from what i have seen it was an average if not below average crowd for a sunday here. Got my food and I was slightly disappointed to see that rather than being half and half meat over the sandwich it was 2 separate halves one corned beef and one pastrami. It was easy enough for me to fix as with the large amount of meet i just split each half and mixed and matched. Just wish i would have been asked about this first.  The food was good and it is very good corned beef and pastrami, the potato salad is fairly bland. The rye bread is pretty good too. They do give a huge portion of meat which is nice. Also had a bloody mary which was good and had a nice spice to it.  Overall a decent meal but took a long time to get food and my smoothie had way to much unblended ice.",

With pancakes the size of your head, and the BEST corned beef hash I've ever tasted, why would ever go anywhere else? Their sandwhiches are feats of engineering, and i love that you get delicious dill pickles as soon as you sit down.  Their matzo ball soup has helped through many a hangover and if you're still not sure, try their baked goods! delicious rugelach and other sweet items.   We went to the one on Shea for the Rosh Hashana dinner (delicious and a great deal for a couple of Jews without a large community of Jewish friends), and I have to say I like the University location better. Great ambiance with the posters what not, and the staff is always pleasant and knows how to treat you.  What can i say, I LOVE this place!",

    "text": "I love Chompies.  I really do.  Just stay far far away from this place on Sunday morning / afternoon.  The place is incredibly understaffed.  Table for 3 with a baby.  Told us it would take 15 minutes to sit.  It took more like 30.  We sit down.  We wait 5 minutes, no waitress.  A table next to us get's seated.  They get greeted, get their drinks then get their food order taken.  Then the same waitress comes over and takes our order.  So now we've waited 30 minutes to be sat and 15 minutes to have a waitress come to our table.  I ask for 1 scrambled egg to come for the baby as soon as it's ready.  10 minutes later a manager comes to the table with our egg.  It's undercooked and cold.  Very mushy.  You would think being the manager, he's qualified to take a look at a scrambled egg and know this is undercooked.  It was quite obvious.  I send it back.  20 minutes later our food comes out.  Still no egg.  I ask the food runner.  She comes back with an egg that cooked fine but freezing cold on a very hot plate (a very tell sign that these eggs have been sitting under a heat lamp for 15 minutes)  If the egg was for me, I would have sent it back.  But it's for a baby and I would have cooled it down before I fed him.    The food was great but never saw our waitress again after she took our food order.  If we wanted water or extra napkins, I got up and got it myself.    This isn't my first rodeo.  My wife had her baby shower here on a Sunday and we got the same crappy service.  I need to remind myself to stop coming here on Sundays.",

While I am sure this spot was always popular due to the food and location in the heart of ASU, its cameo on Man vs. Food has done nothing if made Chompie's a must visit for out-of-towners.  Have no fear, as the food does not disappoint, ESPECIALLY the sliders.  I cannot say enough about how good those stupid mini-sandwiches are.  They receive top billing and completely deserve it.  This is a deli and bakery in the Truest sense of the word.   There are several menu options, but sandwiches and baked goods are the stars here.  Come hungry because Chompie's does not know the meaning of the phrase \"manageable portion.\"  Depending on the time, you may be forced to wait for seating, but that should reinforce the notion that you came to the right place.  To give you perspective, we came in July and gladly sat outside just so we could eat sooner, desert sun be damned.    You really cannot go wrong here, but do yourself a favor and make sure somebody in your party gets the sliders just so you can steal a bite or 9.",

The bloody mary is a little weak, too. But this isn't a bar so why should I even complain? Also, I've never had a \"rainbow cookie\" and was contemplating trying one today... and there were samples on the counter. I had one sample and it blew my freaking mind.

My friends that ordered other dishes didn't seem to like their meals either. The salad was okay, the fries pretty good. I would not come back for the food.

You know me...sign me up. I am eternally in love with the home fries, and have been known to stop by just for a side of them \"to go\"   But I went last Thursday with my 7 year old niece Isabella who was home sick from school (whole other story starting at about 5am which started with my sister calling...\"Please Nesto watch her for me or I'll lose my job\") As a bachelor who eats out a lot, not a ton in the fridge for a kid....so....breakfast? Get in the car.  Seated right away, as always. That's where the service stalled. Birds chirping as my niece looks at me with big sick-y eyes. No water, no server, busser or hostess to flag down.   Finally blondie comes up and looks a bit irritated to se us. \"Do you know what you want ('yet'? seems to be the unspoken word she wants to throw out to finish the question) as if we have been wasting her time in the 10  minutes we haven't seen her. Yes we do. Pancake and OJ for Bell, Coffee two eggs over med, home fries and dry rye for me.   She turns, grabs a tray of complimentary pickles off a side bar and slides them onto the table. The bright green are great. Garlicky and crisp.   5 min, she brings the drinks. kids cup for Bell. No straw. I don't notice it immediately but blondie is right across the isle helping a guy in a tie so when she turns I get her attention. Again she seems pissed that I asked for a straw and drops 4 on the table. WTH?  15 more minutes for food. I am a little interested and not pleased with the fact that the butter and syrup are in disposable pre-packaged containers. Has this always been the case? I am not a pancake eater, so I don't really know, but the place is a BAKERY. Surely they can dole out some butter and have syrup on hand. That was kinda weird.   I was so distracted by that, that I realized after blondie left. NO friggin silverware. OK, now I am starting to get miffed. Flag her down again.  Potatoes, cold. Final straw. The rye was delish. Love that stuff chewy and flavorful. But largely, we left two almost untouched plates as we left the place.   Maybe it was just a bad day for blondie. But that was not a great experience at one of my favorite places. I even forgot to buy a loaf of rye dammit.",

The menu at this place is huge, which I liked. While we waited, we perused the bakery case where there were a variety of delicious looking pastries.  The big thing here apparently is the Jewish slider, and I had to try it because, where else am I going to get such a thing? I ordered the gravy on the side and thoroughly relished two out of the 3 velvet brisket,crisp latke, j ack cheese and gravy sandwiches on homemade challah rolls. They were quite tasty but I cannot believe anyone could eat 12 of these things to get on the wall of fame, or whatever it is.  My sweetie had a fantastic bacon omelet with a jalapeno cheddar bagel. They do have salted caramel cream cheese which is just too weird for me, but BF enjoyed his  bagel with plain cream cheese and house potatoes in case there was a serious carb shortage. .  Service was sweet, iced tea refills kept coming. Only problem was our server brought the check before asking if we wanted dessert....we had to grab some of the sweets to go and ,although eye appealing, the cannoli  were not the highlight of the meal.   I do have a question though? How do you explain all the lovely young and thin Arizona State students ensconced in booths eating mammoth portions of food? How does that work? I could not eat here often, or they would be wheeling me out , but definitely worth a trip for the \"Jewish\" sliders.",

I have had a great time sittig outside yapping with my sister about who knows what while munching on the biggest pastrami and saurkraut sandwich EVER! This thing was HUGE! I was scared, I was elated, I was determined.   I went again for dinner and had my same matzoball soup but this time I had the Chicken Schnitzel. Warm. crunchy and full of flavor I was elated. The sides were eh, I make better carrots and the potatos were okay but the gravy had an odd flavor I wasn't too fond of. I have YET to try a dessert, but someday I am going to damnit!!   Oh and the pickles are yummy! :D Jussayin' The service leave MUCH to be desired for. We had to ask for everything about twice and the staff likes to play handsie in a closed section behind frosted glass. I had craptastic service both times I went. But I still hope ya'll give chomp down on some Chompie's and fall in love with it like I did!!",

They finally called me and when I stood up, the hostess refused to seat me b/c my friend wasn't there yet!!  I told her she was on her way and that I was going to order & eat immediately. She didn't care. I asked her if she would be giving me a different size table if I was by myself and she admitted she wouldn't. Again I asked her what the problem was and demanded to be seated. She just kept saying over and over again that it was their policy and that she would not seat me until my friend arrived in another 15 min.   I was furious! She knew I walked in by myself and sat there right in front of the door by myself reading a book--so why didn't she say something before I wasted all that time?  Additionally, my friends went there about a week prior. After they finished eating they continued to study together for an exam. The place was dead, so it's not like they were taking up tables. The manager actually came over and told them they had to leave b/c they weren't buying anything!!  I will never ever go back there. The food is decent, but sure as heck not worth the poor management and poor service!",

Service was great.. there was a little wait..but it was def worth it. I had a really tasty buffalo chicken wrap..Which i ended up taking half home it was a good amount of food. the breakfast also all looked great and b/f really enjoyed his. they really do have pretty much anything you could want also have fun drinks..Bloody marys, mimosas, root beer floats etc. We checked out the bakery and everything looked delicious.  Everything is affordable not overpriced by any means and large portions. Very cool place, love the menu we will def be going back again. make sure to check out the hall of fame/shame to see good ol' Adam Richmond's mug up there from Man Vs Food.",

Both times I have been there the wait staff were in way over their heads and realy didn't seem to care.  Even the bus boys seemed lost.  BY the time we got our food it was cold and you could tell it had been sitting around for awhile. Our order was wrong from appitizer to entree to drinks and no offer for dessert even if we had wanted it.  Totally forgot  the appitizer with no kind compensation of since they messed up.  Drinks were empty most of the meal and I'm a slow drinker. That said, we did like the food.  But I won't be going out of my way to eat there again.  We drove in from the east valley  to eat there, but it's just not worth the gas.",

    "text": "Found a perfect spot for an early morning meeting, Chompie's in Tempe is convenient, with nice, friendly-service and a great homemade corned beef hash.  When I order coffee, I just love that someone is always coming by to refill the cup and when I ask a question about the menu, I love when that person gives me their honest opinion. I can be picky with my food and Chompie's gave me the best service.  I like the corned beef hash that comes out of the can and although some would consider that disgusting, something about the right amount of salt and crunch, I just happen to love it. So, after asking our server about the corned beef hash, she suggested that I try it and if I didn't like it, I could take it back! That is incredible service because (A) she stood by her product and (B) guaranteed their service was going to be awesome, which also described the corned beef hash.  Also, the menu is robust with a lot of options, so definitely try Chompie's in Tempe.",

I had to try the Jewish Sliders that I had seen on Man V Food.  Obviously, I didn't try the challenge because I don't want to ruin latkes, brisket or challah for me for the rest of my life.  My platter came with three of these gorgeous beauties.  Every element worked perfectly in the sandwich.  You definitely have to dip the slider in the gravy though.  It can taste a little dry without it.  The fries were nice and crispy too.  It is sad that I won't get to try their bagels and other menu items because this menu looked extensive and banging.",

    "text": "Chompies overall was Awesome!   Serves Breakfast all day!  It has been over 20 years since I have been here, and now I wonder why. I thought of it more of a bagel place, with some deli dishes rather than a full blown restaurant. I must have been baked with a wicked hangover way back then, because this was awesome. There is a lot of talk about Chompies because of Man vs. Food, but what really brought me here was that they served breakfast all day.  It took a minute or so to be acknowledged by a host to get seated, but once she showed up we got sat right away. Our sever was very nice, made some suggestions, kept up on our Diet Pepsi refills, and was there but not overbearing.   We ordered the Banana Nut Pancakes, Omelet with Jalapenos (Cabo maybe), and a Killer Skillet with lots of Jalapenos and 2 perfect medium eggs placed on top. I got the blueberry bagel with walnut raisin cream cheese. The wife got a salt bagel with the jalapeno cream cheese (they were out of jalapeno bagels). The pancakes were very good, with lots of banana cooked in the cake, of course with lots of nuts as well. There was a lot of food. Well worth it.  We ordered a piece of German Chocolate Cake to-go. A few hours later we pulled that cake out of the fridge and devoured it with a quickness. Very moist, and the frosting was super yummy.   I just checked for our leftovers, and it looks like someone beat me to it. Dam I was looking forward to that skillet with all the egg and potatoes. I guess easy microwaved leftovers is out.  In search of breakfast now!",

Before I left, I made it a goal to eat at my favorite places, with Chompie's being one of them.  I hadn't been back to any of the Chompie's since Adam Richman had made a stop, but the last time I was there was back in January...and I really don't recall the prices being as exorbitant as they were last week. I know they weren't.  Price gouging aside, the past few times I've been the service has been really...bad. I'm saying bad because I don't feel like swearing, but let's say excrement-y, ok?  I arrived with a friend in tow - we were hungry. The hostess seated us promptly and was very friendly. A guy brought water by...and we sat. For ten minutes. Ten minutes. We made eye contact with 2 servers. No one came by to take our orders.  We ended up leaving. What a pity. I was willing to blow money there for some sliders, too.  Since they didn't want our business, Crackers and Co took it....plus, I saved a few dollars and actually had someone taking my order in under 10 minutes...with a smile.",

    "text": "I've been coming to Chompies for years, and although it has good days and not so good days, this is the very first time that I walked out without eating anything. I never even got to a table. I was meeting friends at about 9:45 AM. We had 4 definite and 1 maybe. 2 of us had arrived and we ordered a table for 5. There was a bit of conversation between the 2 people behind the reception counter and we were told it was going to be a couple of minutes. No problem, we can wait a couple of minutes. We move off to the side. I hear them talking about where they are going to sit us, is one of the rounds (they have 2) available....kind of conversation. Apparently 1 round was available the other was being used. People come in the door behind us and identify themselves as also a party of 5. Next thing I know the gentleman who told us it was going to be a couple of minutes is telling me that they can't seat us because our entire party is not present and I watch as they seat the party of 5 that came in behind us. I am not happy. I call the people that we are going to meet to find out where they are and ask where they would like to eat because I was not staying. They came in, we discussed that we would go to Harlow's. As we were leaving, the gentleman who told me that we would not be seated until our entire party was present, and remember we weren't sure if one would be there at all, says that they can seat us. I tell him that in all if the years I had been going to Chompies no one had ever played the \"can't seat you until everyone's here rule. He points to a sign on the counter that says \"no seating until everyone is present\". I didn't doubt they had the policy just that it had never been used against me and I though the fact that he was so blatantly obvious about it was insulting. If the restaurant was packed, I might have been able to understand. If he had been more up front and  gracious about it maybe, but it wasn't packed and it was handled poorly. I am very very dissppointed in Chompies. I picked 1 star because they had a pumpkin pound cake as samples on thr deli counter.",

The waiter brought a small glass of water and a tiny tray of quarter-sliced sour and half-sour pickles.  I really like the sours but not so much with the half-sours.  I ordered a full corned beef sandwich with Coney Island knish (my fave).  The waitress brought my order and I went right into the sandwich.  The corned beef left  something to be desired.  The corned beef was pretty dry so I had to drown the corned beef in mustard to make it more palatable.  The knish was overcooked and slightly burned leaving an off-putting taste, so again the mustard saved the night.  The only highlight of this dinner was a seven-layer cake.  It was delicious.  I was disappointed with their service and food quality.  I don't know if they had an off night.  I am a native New Yorker and have gone to Chompie's quite a few times and normally they delivered.",

The staff is very nice and very courteous but a little bit slow. I have noticed this both times I have been there. The food is a little expensive but with huge portions.  I must say though the menu is long and extensive and that worries me a bit. When I think long menu I thing frozen lots of frozen. But that could be just me. I do notice that they serve mimosas which is a big plus in my book.  Now the food portion of the review, the other guests that I have been with said there food was delicious, it looked to be really good. The first time I went one of my coworkers had the \"Old Fashioned Borenstein Burger\" and the other had a \"Monte Cristo\" and it was huge. Today I went with my family, my daughter had the \"Silver Dollar Pancakes\" which were not silver dollar pancakes, but crazy HUGE pancakes. It makes me wonder what a normal pancake looks like. My wife had a \"Classic Belgian Waffle\" with candied pecans mixed in. sadly the pecans came piled on top and were not candied.   I must admit I have not tried anything but there \"Old Fashioned Borenstein Burger\". And it is huge and delicious I usually get mine with bacon and cheese, the fries are awesome they are not your usual wimpy fries, they are steak sized but have a flakiness to them if that makes any sense at all. Overall I'm in love with their burger, but you would need to do something seriously wrong to make me dislike a burger.  And one more thing, its dangerous to have a bakery right there displaying awesome sweets. I'm usually not into sweets but on a whim my coworker told me to pick something and the \"Like Heaven\" little cups caught my eye. Tried the Oreo one which is a chocolate cup with cream and bits of what look like crumbled Oreos on top, which might explain the name, and just to let you know good lord it was like heaven! If heaven is like that, I will gladly serve the lord so I can get some more of those tasty little treats. Today on my visit I bought three, one for my daughter and two for me. I know, I know.  Well in the end this place is decent the prices are a little high, but the food is good and you get your monies worth. Next time ill try something else maybe breakfast who knows.",

Christopher was very helpful in helping me choose the sandwiches I would need for 16 women. The day before pick up, Brian called to go over my order and explain the presentation. He called a second time to verify pick up time. When I went to get my order, it was just as I had hoped. The cookie tray looked amazing and the sandwich trays were nicely done with a generous portion of meats. They included another tray with lettuce, tomatoes, and onions and mayo and mustard and silverware. I cannot recommend Chompies enough. It was perfect.",

Example me and my mom came here dinner time to eat and we wanted to dine out (since it was nice and hot out) so we asked to be seated outside they told us it's closed but there was already people outside on the patio area with their dogs eating so I asked why there's people outside on the patio area if it's closed then she said she'll ask another server if he could serve us outside and while we was waiting there was 3 servers talking about it and the server she wanted to serve us on the patio gave us dirty looks while they was talking and he was shaking his head so then me and my mom felt really uncomfortable and awkward like we felt out of place we just asked to order to go instead. I don't wanna play the race card here which I never do cause it's ridiculous but every time I come here I get treated differently compared to the other customers so service and staff really need to be trained or replaced. But the food is good",

I usually get a bagel sandwich just because I love them, but their home style cooking is beautifully done and anything on the menu is most likely a tasty choice. The owners are actually from New York and carry a nostalgic feel throughout the open kitchen. Concept and the dessert cases up front. Don't forget to grab one on the way out, they are pretty hard to miss and harder to pass up!",

OKC (where I live) is not exactly known as a lox mecca so I had to go with the tried and True hand-cut nova and bagel.  A nice doughy chewy delicious bagel, plenty of capers, thick slices of bermuda onion and melt-in-your-mouth nova (plus the obligatory schmear).Plus the portions are always enormous. I should have stopped (but couldn't) at just half the bagel and lox. My niece and nephews joined me so I got to witness my very thin niece polish off fluffy pancakes so large they would have killed me and my nephews polish off corned beef hash (for one) and bagel breakfast skins (the other). Again huge delicious portions and not a teeny morsel left from one of us at the table. Plus great attentive service. So why not 5 stars? I'm a tough grader.",

As an aside, I enjoy the food at this location more than at the Chompies location on Shea Blvd.  In addition, this location tends to get quite busy on work days after 12 pm.  This especially holds True when ASU is in session.  The portions at Chompies are large.  I can't remember ordering an item and feeling as though I was being served an insubstantial portion.  Plus there are AYCE pickles and that always helps the pass the modest wait for the food to come to the table.  The mile high deli sandwiches are as the name implies, BIG.  I have found that there is more than enough food if you opt for a half-sandwich served on a bagel or roll.  Their babka French toast is quite good and so are their omelets.  If you have a sweet tooth, and enjoy French toast, this is definitely a dish that is worth a try.",

I have to say that when  finally did make it here, they were not disappointing.  Beef brisket with latkes on challa bread -- these guys are geniuses!  The Cowboy sliders with onion strings and barbecue sauce on them were pretty darn good as well.  Everything was so good in fact, that I took 4 sliders in a box for my drive back to the bay area the next day!  I was also able to try some local beer, as well as some of their soup, which was all good!  Their bakery looked pretty amazing as well, but I filled myself up on all you can eat sliders, so I didn't get a chance to try any dessert.  It's ok though.  It was worth it.    My only complaint is that there isn't a Chompie's near me!",

    "text": "I was out with my colleague who has seen the episode of Man Vs Food that featured the Jewish Sliders, and we just had to come by. I mean, we seriously went out of our way to visit. We road the BUS, OMG. I'm still astonished that we were able to find our way around using surface public transportation, but that's besides the point.   Chompie's is ok. Everything looks amazing, and sounds amazing, and it's one of those deals where you cannot come in here when you're hungry or else you'll order way too much because the menu reads like a best of list of comfort foods. Anyway, I was torn between the Pastrami and the Jewish Sliders. Our waitress, Jess, couldn't help since apparently those are a couple of the best and most popular dishes. It would be like comparing Michael Jordan and Lance Armstrong. They're both amazing, it's just a matter of narrowing your meal criteria. I ended up with the Jewish Sliders since brisket, cheese, and a potato cake, all drenched in gravy just sounded too good, and unique to pass up. First thing I did upon receiving the plate was to get more gravy. There is no such thing as too much gravy. I went to to submerge sections of the sliders and slowly enjoy each bite. Remarkable mixture of flavors and the gravy makes a huge difference. Here's the problem though, the brisket was a little dry and tasteless. Without the cheese and gravy, the sliders would have been a miss. All together with the extra gravy however, they were good. I did go on to mention this detail to Jess when she came to check on us. I felt like the manager or whoever keeps track of customer comments would probably want to know that the brisket was dry? Well when Jess came back with the check, she surprised me with half of a pastrami sandwich! OMG, this made my week! I suppose she wanted to make sure that I left on a good note and through this small gesture, I most certainly did. I haven't tried the pastrami yet, but Jess promised that it would be everything I hoped for. I believe her.   Also had a thick delectable chocolate milkshake that nearly sent me into a food coma from all the syrup, whipped cream, and of course the cherry on top.   I like this place a lot. It also doesn't hurt that they treat their customers right and really listen to feedback. I'll be coming back.",

On rare occasions, there won't be a wait - so don't show up starving in case there is one. Love the bagels here (OBVIOUSLY) even though I just like plain with cream cheese. Great with a cup of regular coffee and omelet. I ordered hash for the first time last week. Served with lots-o-meat, but wasn't the best I've had - so I'll stick with omelets from now on.  P.S. Chompie's has these ridiculously good cookies you can eat (or bring home) while waiting called Rugelach - OMG - where have they been all my life? The apple or light colored ones are the best! Now I hope there is a line every time I go just as an excuse to eat these before breakfast.",

This isn't too far from the airport so if you are staying in the area, definitely come here. The line wasn't too bad and we were seated within 20 minutes. Good atmosphere and everyone was wearing some kind of Arizona team shirt.  We ordered 2 sliders which were good for each of us as a starter. We both loved the challah bread. But then I also wanted to eat something else as a main course. My gf ordered the beef brisket sandwich which was just as good as the sliders but more meat. The meat was thinly sliced and very tender. She could only eat half of the sandwich so she took the other half to-go which she ate later in the hotel which turned out to be a great snack later. I had the turkey and roast beef sandiwch (I can't remember the name of the sandwich) but it was too much for us. I was definitely full and I'm glad we came here before the game because we'd be eating dogs n drinking beer all day long.  Waitress was attentive and we did have a good experience. I'd definitely come here again when we visit.",

My husband tasted it and confirmed it was a moldy taste. The waitress was a trooper and tasted the other half of my bagel and promptly spit it out. She agreed it tasted moldy and got the manager. Mr manager was very sure their bagels were baked fresh daily. I just know there was no sign of mold but a very strong taste of mold. He offered me something else so I took an eclair to go but he still charged me for my meal.  My coffee was luke warm, my husbands bacon was tiny and his over medium eggs were runny. If manager had taken my breakfast off the bill I might give them another chance but he blew it with customer service. I will never go back.",

This place gets chaotic on the weekends but the staff does a pretty amazing job at making sure all their guest are taken care of in a timely manner. I hold a special spot in my heart for a good bagel, and these are damn near close to what I get back home! Which is saying a lot since I'm a mild bagel snob. All of the waitresses I've had have been super charismatic and friendly even when they are extremely busy they will still start up a conversation with you. Karen is one of my favorite servers at this establishment and has been taking care of me for over a year. She always has my coffee topped off and making me laugh harder then anyone can at 9am! If you are ever in the Phoenix metropolitan area and need a great east coast diner meal, I highly recommend Chompie's in Tempe! (Definitely try the Jewish sliders, that is what they are famous for after all!)  I am puzzled as to how the review below me could remotely bad mouth this establishment and Karen. Surely the woman doesn't work in the industry if she planned to \"run a bitch around and stiff her\". Well hopefully she won't return and waste a table space!",

From their amazing fried matzah balls (never seen this anywhere before), to their famous Jewish sliders (brisket, cheddar, and a potato latke on a challah roll), our food was delicious.  Typical of other great regional delis, like Brents in the Los Angeles area, you get a tremendous amount of food, which justifies the higher prices.  They have a challenge to eat 12 of their sliders in 30 minutes for a free meal, which is crazy, since I couldn't finish the plate of 3 sliders taking my time.  Excellent choice of sides as well, and everything we had was incredibly fresh.  This is my new \"go to\" place while visiting the Tempe area.",

    "text": "\"We wanted to take you out for your last dinner...so we got to thinking 'what place has specials on a Tuesday?'..and I remembered Chompie's has a special..AND A FOOD CHALLENGE.\"  And THAT is how I ended up at Chompie's on a Tuesday.  They were featured on TV (I think it's Man Vs. Food, but I'm not sure) bc of this food challenge of theirs.  On Tuesdays, they have a special - AYCE Jewish sliders & fries with the purchase of a beverage for $11.95.  (Keep in mind, a plate of 3 Jewish sliders + fries is $11.95.)  I was told the specialties here are sliders.  The sliders themselves are a decent size (I'd say maybe it's the same size as the tiny McD's burgers, but taller?).  Jewish sliders have potato cakes in them; Western sliders don't; breakfast sliders are something completely different.  Everything we ordered was ehhhh (befitting of a \"meh, I've experienced better\" rating).  Two things that did impress me, however, were:  1. They place pickles on the table right when you sit down!  I'm not a pickle girl myself, but it's a nice gesture. 2. Everyone here is so FRIENDLY (I mean genuinely friendly!!).  Idk, I think most Arizonians in general are friendlier than the Californians I encounter on a daily basis hahahhaa.  And our waitress went out of her way to split 5 checks for our party of 7...that was pretty cool of her.  I'm glad I went here for the experience, but I wouldn't come back again.  Lesson learned: Don't trust a bunch of post-gym, hungry, non-Yelping boys to pick a dinner spot ;)",

What I found at Chompie's was not good and I'm not sure it can even be classified as corned beef. While they offer extra lean for $2.00 extra making the sandwich $17.99, the fatty excuse for corned beef they provided at $15.99 wasn't good enough for a dog. Besides being extremely fatty (I certainly expect some, it's corned beef) this sandwich had zero flavor except that which was supplied by the rye bread. I have been to many delis in 60 years, and I have never experienced such a poor meal.",

Marginal service and marginal food  PROS: the bus boy was busting his hump and doing a damn good job  CONS: food was on the tail end of warm. How does this happen in a place 10% full at 0730 on a Thursday?  Service was less than pleasurable: our waitress exacerbated a sour experience by coming across like she wished she was somewhere else, far away. Anyway, she arrived about 5 mins after we were seated--it's a workday morning--I want to eat and go!    Drink order is executed and another 5 mins passes. It's coffee and a soda, not fresh squeezed kiwi juice--why 5 mins?  We finally place the order, and our server stops at 4 tables to refill water, bus table, and take an order. Hey! How about getting my order in the system? \"Crispy bacon, please!\" was a bridge too far; sausage links didn't even get to the warm category, as the first bite led me to question if the sole grill mark was an act of cosmetology or a malignant omen.  Come on, really?  I've done Chompies 3x, all for bfast, primarily due to convenience of location to ASU. Each time the chow is no better than average, service just an okay. Today, Chompies failed me.   I won't be coming back.  Cheers! RS",

    "text": "I went to Chompies this afternoon to take advantage their St. Patrick's Day Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner.  My experience started off well.  I arrived shortly before 3 pm and I was delighted to have arrived at an hour when they weren't busy at all.    I was seated immediately in a nice booth, and water was quick to follow.  I spent just a moment reviewing the menu, and just as I made my decisions, my server showed up.  He was a friendly young man, and after answering a couple of questions for me and letting me know that they were out of the Vegetable Medley, he took my order.  I ordered the Corned Beef and Cabbage dinner which came with corned beef, cabbage - and I elected to have boiled red potatoes and mashed potatoes with gravy as my two sides.  The dinner also came with soup or salad, and I requested to have the sour cabbage soup to go, and ordered a glass of strawberry lemonade.  My soup to go, and my dinner came out pretty quickly, but as I ate a bite of the red boiled potatoes, I realized that the potatoes were nearly cold.  I checked the rest of my food, and it was all room temperature.  I had to wait a few minutes for my server  to come within view, and I hailed  him.  I explained that my potatoes were cold, and that nothing on the plate was thoroughly heated.  He told me that he would bring me a new plate that was hot as quickly as possible.  The new plate came out a few minutes later, but it was actually the same plate (I had cut a piece or two of corned beef, and sliced my cabbage wedge in half before I realized the food wasn't heated).  I didn't really mind that it wasn't a new plate, it just wasn't what I was told would happen.  No big deal.  The food was still only warm, not hot, but I was hungry and so I didn't send it back again.  Also, my gravy was now missing from the plate.  I didn't make an issue of it since I had decided on taking the masked potatoes home with me, and figured I could just bring me a container of gravy to go when I finished eating.  I knew that I would be taking quite a bit of food home with me as the portions were VERY generous.   After awhile my server returned to see how my food was.  I said it was better, that I was planning to take my mashed potatoes with me and would need my gravy to go since they hadn't brought it out with my \"new\" plate of food.  He quickly brought me a to go box and a container of gravy.  While he was getting the gravy, I'd noticed that I never got my strawberry lemonade, so when he returned I asked him to take it off my check.  He apologized and said he would bring me one to go for free.  He returned to let me know they didn't have the strawberry mix for the lemonade.  I indicated that plain lemonade was fine.  I packed up my potatoes, gravy and other leftovers into the to go box.  He returned with the lemonade and helped me to bag my to go containers, and took away my now empty plate.  Then, nothing...  I sat there waiting for my check, and waited, and waited.  Part way into my wait I checked my watch, and waited another 10 minutes.  I could see my waiter walking around, standing and talking to other staff members, talking some more, but he never came close enough for me to flag down.  Finally, I took my things, went to the front counter, and told them that I wanted to pay, but I'd been waiting for my check for over 10 minutes.  The gentleman at the front very nicely looked up my table, provided my check, and took my payment.  The restaurant still wasn't very busy, so the issues that I had may just relate to how that location of Chompies is run.  The food, properly heated, would have rated 4 solid stars.  The cold food and service issues don't allow me to spare more than a 2 star rating.  Sorry for the length of this.",

I disliked the taste of celery every time I took a sip of my drink ( that was with me taking the celery out ). I ordered the French omelet which had bacon, mushrooms and onions. My whole omelet was covered in cheese which I had to scrape off and the food was dry. The only thing I enjoyed was my cheddar jalapeno bagel . On top of that our server was super slow with getting drinks, bringing out of our food and she forgot to bring our sides of salsa that we asked for.

So this is what I've been deprived of? Wow, the matzo chicken soup was hearty and delicious! It has a wonderful homemade taste and feel and really hit the spot! A dash of pepper and you have a very fulfilling meal. And of course I had to have a bagel - a jalapeno bagel with cream cheese and it was scrumptious. Ask for a sample of their delicious high quality cream cheeses, there are so many yummy flavors.   My boyfriend had the corned beef hash and he said it was the best he ever tasted. The meat was very lean and the portion was decent. He loved the coffee too (and he's picky about coffee).   I finished off the meal with a slice of german chocolate cake. Unlike grocery stores who sell sickly sweet cakes, Chompies emphasizes the coconut and almonds while keeping the sweetness in check so I was able to enjoy sweet and savory. The cake is so awesome I plan to buy a whole sheet. Good job Chompies on taking pride in your cooking and baking. I will be back to try more and more dishes!   Thank you to the staff for their superb customer service, I leave happy every time I visit!",

Bryan ensured we were seated for my comfort! Especially impressed since today is a holiday, venue was crowded and Bryan was short staffed!! Kudos to Bryan and his management expertise!

Regardless, I was seated within five mins. My server checked on me right away, took my drink order and brought me ice water.   I ordered the Soup and Jewish Slider Combo, with Chicken Noodle and Matso Ball soup plus corned beef sliders.   The menu was huge, with plenty of breakfast, brunch and lunch items.   My meal arrived in 12 mins. My server, Jessica, took good care of her whole section, despite the crowd.   The soup was light, full of tender-crisp veggies and a big matzo ball. It had plenty of chicken and noodles.   The two sliders were outstanding, with fresh but firm challah bread, roast beef, jack cheese, a potato pancake and horseradish spread. It also came with a side of rich brown Gravy for dipping and 1/4 cup slaw.   The meal came to $16.09 plus tip.",

The answer became apparent as soon as I got my food: it's bland.   Portions are generous and everything seems fresh, but it just doesn't have much flavor. I had a pastrami sandwich with sauerkraut, two things not known for their mild flavors, but I might as well have been eating packaged turkey and iceberg lettuce.  My lunch partner's egg salad sandwich was even blander than my food. It looked like the eggs had been all but pureed, like it was slightly lump yellow mustard.  I don't know if someone in the kitchen is on a low-sodium diet or what, but the chefs really need to rediscover salt and other seasonings.",

So bring a big appetite.  Chompies serves all the authentic deli sandwiches, soups, salads, bagels, breads and desserts.   The sandwiches at Chompies are delicious. The  Pastrami and Corned Beef are perfectly lean, piled high,and very tender. If you make it to Chompies you have to try the Original  Jewish sliders.  These sliders are incredible. Moist lean brisket, piled high on challah roll, a mini potato pancake on the bottom,  with jack cheese, served with a side of hot brown dipping  gravy, I can eat those everyday.  The soups are wonderful, especially the matzo ball. The pastry counter is endless, you have to try the black and white cookie  Chompie's is a must for breakfast or lunch if your in the area!",

Three strikes and they are out.  The last three visits have been especially bad.  My final visit their bakery case was empty which should have been my first warning.  Not empty from customers buying empty rather from they stop making/stocking.  When we sat down I decided I'll try something new on their menu \"Avocado Toast\" The \"toast\" was cold.  I waited patiently ~10 minutes for the waitress to return and ask if I could order something different.  I asked for a menu which took another 5 minutes then I ordered Oatmeal with Blueberries which she told me they don't serve after 11 it was 10:45 at this time which I mentioned and she said oh ok I can check but the blueberries are not fresh, so I said ok never mind I can take a hint.  I waited for my wife to finish her also not hot Eggs Benedict she is more forgiving than I.  When she was done we waited for at least five minutes before the waitress brought our check and during that time the table across from us had a chance to complain to the \"manager\" also about SURPRISE cold food he quickly began to berated the customer in front of the rest of us.  It was embarrassing that Chompie's has sunk so low.",

Omg so good it was hard not to buy a loaf of everything after our meal, thank God we were stuffed.  The chicken & waffles were so amazing! Baked with jalapeno corn. Topped with some tenders. Butter and syrup on the side. I've never had chicken&waffles before, but this has inspired a new food love.  I personally ordered the Guanajuato Benedict. So delicious. Spicy! Which is exactly what I wanted. They actually know how to poach an egg, then the avocado hollandaise and spicy chorizo were so yummy together. Came on top of a bagel. I'm embarrassed I ate the whole plate and like half my boyfriend's chicken and waffles.  5 stars for my awesome breakfast experience even if every time else I been here the service has been hella rude haha.... even from the owners when getting take out.

My office bought lunch from Chompies today and I ordered the Rachel's Motown for the very first time.  WOW is all I can say.  The corned beef I got was lean and mixed very good with the coleslaw.  I've always disliked 1000 Island Dressing, but their house made dressing is so good!  I will give them a pass for the bad customer service that I had on one occasion.  I will be back for this sandwich again.  You won't be disappointed.",

So if you're looking for good tasting food, then go here and rate them. But if you're looking for cool hip vibe, then this ain't the place for you.",

    "text": "EDIT: Customer service contacted me and is listening and fixing the issue. Thanks chompies for listening and for the prompt customer service. The food is always good and i love celebrating Hanukkah with my matzo from Chompie's.   Original review: I'm giving it two stars because I used to come here a lot and never had a bad experience.  The past 4 times I've been have been the worst service I've ever received.  The last time I went was on Friday September 14.  Jessica was our server and it was later at night.  We weren't brought pickles right away. And when we did ask for half sour we were brought the wrong pickles. They were disgusting and sweet. Nothing like the half sour I'm used to. When we went in today, we were informed that they had been out of half sour pickles for awhile now and have been awaiting their return.  So after Jessica argued about which pickles we had we started to order.  I ordered the early riser sandwich with corned beef hash on it (since that's an option) and Jessica proceeded to inform me that the early riser is a sandwich and that it's weird that I ordered corned beef hash on my sandwich (it's actually not weird at all. It's very common lol)  And after the snide comments about our orders, she brought us our food.  The food was great, my bagel was a little under toasted but I was hungry so I didn't mention that.  We were on my friends lunch break so we could only have a couple bites and then I got a box for the rest of my food, Jessica made a comment about how little I ate. It really upset me to hear this because a.) we were on a lunch break. B.) I've been recovering from a severe eating disorder and it can be rough when people make comments like that sometimes.  I don't want to dine in anymore if I'm going to hear backlash comments and I certainly won't be back for awhile. Chompies you've really let me down :/",

(When we came in, we saw some folks sitting out there) The hostess told us she wasn't sure if they were seating anyone there, and since that seemed like a hint that they didn't want anyone out there, I told her we were fine with sitting inside. (The dinning room was pretty stuffy, but I know better than to anger waitstaff at a restaurant) We started with a potato knish, which was reheated, but tasted okay. We both ordered extra lean corned beef sandwiches, hers with matzo ball soup, mine with fries. Both of us found the corned beef to be greasy and fatty. (Don't know if this is always their extra lean, but it didn't seem like extra lean) My GF said the broth to her soup tasted lime Campbell's, and matzo ball was bland. My fries were actually potato wedges, but okay none the less. Overall I would say this a pretty disappointing experience. I will wait for my visits to Chicago and Florida for real Jewish deli food.",

    "text": "This is where we always go for Mother's Day since menu, which is more like a book, can accommodate both  the youngest picky eater, and the elderly picky eater.  Even though the menu can be intimidating, it would be very far fetched to say that someone could like NOTHING on the menu.  You can get anything from plain pancakes, to extravagant omelets, to a simple hotdog, to a plethora of smoked fish, to a healthy salad, to a massive burger covered in ranch dressing.  And I am not even kidding - you can have a traditional thanksgiving meal of turkey, gravy, cranberry sauce and potato, covered in cheese, and stuffed into a slider - any day of the week.  I enjoy  the fact that they serve breakfast all day, coupled with the fact that there is a full bar, and ordering wine or beer or gin and tonic with  your pancakes is perfectly reasonable.  The service has never been bad, but it has been slow. However, Chompies provides all-you-can-eat dill pickles that are everything you would expect from pickles at a jewish deli.    If the menu is intimidating, stick to the stuff that Chompies is known for - massive sandwiches, sliders on challah bread, and bagels.  In fact, next to the door there is a clearance rack of day old bagels, which last a long time, especially in  the freezer.  There are 12 bagels per bag, for $2.50.  At Costco, a dozen of bagels costs $5 and at the grocery store, a half a dozen bagels cost $5, so this is a great deal if you embrace carbs like us.",

Add a Matzo Ball and your belly is full too!  Their Bagels are   really good, but for the carbs, which I try to cut back on as much as possible without loosing my mind.  So, when I crave a bagel or a croissant it's the Cragel for me, love croissants, like bagels, together a cragel is the right carb combo for me. I had a cragel and egg sandwich last week, very satisfying.  I used to love the sweets but since I am more selective with treats due to my constant risk of a burgeoning girth, I have found that they are not worth it anymore though they LOOK  Gorgeous they taste kinda bland, old, dry, and stale, The chocolate babka is still very good but I don't ever really crave it. Love the new location at the Arrowhead mall, clean, bright, good service, only place i would really eat in the mall when in need of a quick bite.",

Prices are fairly reasonable and day-old baked goods are usually heavily discounted.

First off, when asked what you would like to drink, if you say water, it's a bit alarming when the waitress asks (tells) you, are you sure you wouldn't like a lemon in that water?  It's cause the water they serve tastes terrible.  Seriously.  Second, I'm a huge fan of Kreplach soup.  So when I saw it on their menu, I got rather excited.  That excitement didn't last for long.  The Kreplach looked like they were mass produced, all identical, not hand made.  They were skinny.  Don't bother ordering it.  If you order a half sandwich, the cole slaw that comes with it, well, you need a magnifying glass to see it... really, why provide a serving in a thimble?  It's a shame, cause the cole slaw actually was good.  The corned beef sandwiches were ok, they seem to get pleasure out of their size... for $13 or whatever, I expect them to be big.  They were good, not great, but good.  The entrance is a dizzy array of the check in area, the register area, the take out area, and a merchandising area.  The seating area is pretty plain.  All in all, if this is Tempe's definition of a wantabee Jewish deli, it has the advantage to most places away from the two coasts, but it really doesn't pass the appearance or taste test.  Better than none, I'll concede that.  But disappointed, perhaps cause it bills itself as something it's not...",

Brisket and aujus good, rye bread stale, hard and old , coleslaw good , hotdog good .. Experience ruined everyone's time for a return here ..You should highly think of replacing that rude young person as a first point of contact.. Especially if one asks for a different table ..Good luck all..",

Good thing I didn't order more . . . after a long conversation catching up with my friend . . . I realized that three was just right.  The food was good and hot, moist and tasty, and the pickles were just enough garlicy.  I will definately be back.

After over 30 minutes of waiting for our DELI MEAT sandwiches, I found what looked like a manager and said we had been waiting a long time and soon had to go. He disappears and later comes back to the table, blaming it on the kitchen that somehow the ticket was misplaced. I used to serve, I get that shit happens but our waitress, who was horrible at this point, should have noticed sooner. So we got our mediocre sandwiches and barely had time to eat them. The quality was Nothing like I had remembered and I only ate it because it was starving. The pickles served tasted sour. And of course, because the Jewish owner would rather just banter and wave his hands at us, opposed to doing anything about this disgusting experience, I'm taking my business elsewhere. Do not go to this location if anything. You have been warned.",

    "text": "I absolutely love Chompies! It's the closest thing to a New York style deli that I have found in Phoenix. They have a very large and extensive menu and everything I've ordered has been really good.  They also have an amazing bakery that offers a very large assortment of tasty treats such as black and white cookies, red velvet cake, enormous eclairs, napoleons, and New York style cheese cake.  I'd say that my favorite thing on the menu is the pastrami sandwich, although I recently tried the Jewish Sliders after seeing them on Man vs. Food. The sliders were really good, unlike any slider I have ever had. The challah bread and potato pancake gave these sliders a very unique flavor, very tasty. I also tried the Western Sliders and those are good as well.   Although I live closer to their new location in Chandler, I still go to the Tempe location because of the hot ASU waitresses.  Chompies is the best!",

They seated us in a booth that had pitchers of water right behind my head. We moved to another table.  The Lox and Bagel was almost $16. Maybe that's a normal price now but seems expensive. When I last ordered this there seemed to be more lox. We had to ask for pickles - last time they were given to us without asking. Two little olives on the plate. One little skimpy container of cream cheese - I should have asked for another because it just barely covered the bagel halves. Lots of capers which was good.  I got the impression that they are having financial problems.  The dessert counter person was excellent, though.",

It was a saturday morning, and the place was packed, which reminded me of a bob evans after sunday church.   Word of advice, don't read the whole menu. Have an idea of what you're craving before opening the menu, and go straight to that section. Omelet, sandwich, salad, whatever. Their menu is extensively dizzying and could give you a seizure if you stare too long at it.  I simply ordered some strawberry pancakes and my fiance ordered an omelet with some home fries and toast. I got a huge stack that had 3 pancakes with whipped cream, strawberries and syrup. My fiance's order was equally as big. She also ordered a napolean for dessert (at 9 am?) and it was way too sweet and a little on the stale side. I would guess Chompies is not known for their dessert section.  Overall, if you want good breakfast, and a lot of it at a reasonable price, then give this place a try.",

Their service is pretty awful so I don't eat in very often, but when I'm feeling under the weather there's nothing like an order of matzo ball soup to go! I think it's a bit pricey, but since there's no where else to get this stuff, I can't really complain. I get the small size soup with an extra matzo ball and the total is around $7. (I love the matzo balls but have never been a big soup fan; I like just enough soup to keep the matzo balls warm)",

    "text": "Although I have gone to Chompie's at its various locations numerous times, this is the first review I have written.  Coming from NY, it is actually refreshing to be in a place that has a massive menu, great service and significant portions.  I am SO tired of people recommending deli's and saying they are like NY.  I had my hopes dashed too many times.  This place without a doubt comes the closest to the NY deli's I went to for 20 years in Manhattan.  Now.  I discovered that I enjoy this place most when I moderate my choices.  For a long time, I was getting soup and then a huge sandwich and made sure it had cheese and fries on the side.   It made me \"fear\" Chompie's because I would end up too full.  No more.  Now, I get a small bowl of Matzoh Ball soup.  It is without a doubt the most delicious and consistently enjoyable...especially this time of year.  Then, I get a half sandwich- corned beef on marble rye...no cheese...cole slaw on the side.  Seltzer to drink.  I leave feeling great.  And because the soup comes first, I enjoy that thoroughly with no interruptions from the corned beef.  It may not be Eisenberg's on 5th Avenue and 23rd Street in Manhattan...but the soup sure comes close.  Thank you.",

    "text": "Had a really unpleasant dining experience tonight. I've eaten here many times and it's been fine. I write this tonight hoping that a manager will read this and take corrective action. First - I had to wait 20 minutes and when I was seated the restaurant was empty except for about 4 tables. this was before 7 pm.  Second when I ordered the waiter told me they were out of pastrami. How does a deli run out of pastrami?? Especially when at least half of t)e items on the menu contain pastrami! Third mthe corned beef i got instead was so fatty and tough it was hard to eat. Fourth I had to wait half an hour after I finished eating to have my plate cleared and get a check.  Fifth when I left at about 7:50 they had locked the front door and wanted me to go out into their very dark parking lot through a side door. There were several other tables still eating but they turned out the lobby lights after I left - closing time is at 8.  Last the staff - while not really rude - had NO interest in the customers. They blew everything off, didn't speak except to tell me the front door was locked (one girl said it wasn't and opened it for me). They made it abundantly clear that they could care less about their work- and I am a very uncrabby easy-going diner. Oh, yeah, and the bagels I bought to bring home were hard as a rock. It will be a LONG time before I return.",

    "text": "We went there yesterday a I enjoyed it. The atmosphere was fantastic, because they had a tv, plus they have a lot of pictures of Man V. Food, when Adam Richman came here. The service is good, because they waited for us to order, and were very patient.   I ordered the Jewish Slider like Adam did, but I didn't take the challenge. 1 order of Jewish SIiders are 3 sliders. The sliders were awesome. The meat was tender and really juicy. The cheese didn't really make a difference, it just added a little flavor, but the bun soft and chewy, and buttery which tasted like pancakes without syrup, and it was fresh. The potato pancakes put the lid on the jar. The potato pancakes aren't just a creative idea, it was very crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. There are 3 reasons why this isn't a normal slider. Reason number one is the Potato Pancakes, reason number two is the meat isn't a patty, and grinded beef that made that slider interesting. Reason number three is that the cheese is melted. REALLY melted. I will go again, because the sliders are amazing.",
