    "text": "I went to Casa Filipina Bakeshop & Restaurant. I am no expert on Filipino food. I have only been to one in CA twice. I  want to find a place in Phoenix. Surprise there is one 7 miles from where I live.  They are located in a strip mall. You may miss them unless you was looking. Very simple lay out. Has a home feeling. Nothing fancy. Clean. As you enter you pass a glass case with very good looking pastries. An extremely nice young man showed me to a table. It was about 4:30pm so I was the only person in the restaurant. He asked if I had eaten Filipino food before. I told him only twice before and I would need help. He suggested the beef steak. Prepared in a sauce with onion and potatoes. No processed taste, genuine home cooked meal.  Very taste. There was a salad of fine noodles. I did enjoy everything I had a dessert of Ube and a cup of coffee. When i left everyone invited me back. It was only about 5:15pm by now and they were setting up for a band that plays there on Fridays. I have been to a lot of places to eat. The people here made me feel at home and welcome. I am going back. Probably tomorrow for lunch or dinner. I gave them 4 stars. I will probably change this to a 5 next review.",

    "text": "We enjoyed several plates here.  By far my favorite was the pork belly of course.  I love bacon so pork belly is a must.  The pork belly came out cut up in perfect two bite morsels for me.  A nice crunchy top with a soft underside is a great mix of meat goodness.  The sauce is on the sweet side, but not so much that it takes away flavor.  Plus it is a great sweet sauce for the meat. We also had the Pan cit Malabon, which has a spaghetti type noodle that is cut up.  I mean the texture and thickness reminded me of a spaghetti noodle.  The shrimp was only ok, as noted by a dinner guest on mine.  I cannot comment as I am allergic to shellfish.  I did chance the noodles since the top is sprinkled with pork rinds.  Interesting, but not my first pick next visit. The fired chicken was good, very crispy, but for the $7.99 price 2 pieces of chicken was not what I expected.  With everything else on the larger side I found this to be lacking in value for my dollar. We also sampled the flan dessert, which was creamy and sweet.  Nice mix and most likely I would try again.  I also tried the Halo-halo which my first experience.  Nice dessert that I would go for again.  A mix of sweet, ice and a small slice of flan on top.  All enjoyed in a plastic cup for you to enjoy for at least a half an hour of mixing ice with the sweet bottom mix.    If you are in the area and craving a great Filipino food experience stop here.  I will try some other dishes next time I am in the area.",

When we got our food, it was in a different container and we didn't open it til we got home. There were 2 small pieces of meat with a little bit of sauce. This measly portion could have fit in the small to-go container that was $3 cheaper.   We called the restaurant to complain about the small serving size we got and the lady on the phone ask two asked us things that turned me from irritated and a little upset to angry and outraged. First she asked it we were regulars then if I was Filipino.  Hmmm..I didn't know that their level of customer service was based on restaurant loyalty and nationality.  So what if I'm not a regular customer or Filipino? doesnt that mean they can give me smaller portions for the same price? I'll never eat at this place again!!",

The food just had the right taste, without the added greasiness or the added msg. Not only that, but they didn't skimp out on the meats. The meat was really meat not just innards. That made me happy. The only thing I found awkward was that the rice came portioned to each plate.. and if you wanted more, you had to ask. I don't know of any other restaurant that does that and if you are conscious about your carb intake this would be a good thing for you, but for someone like me, it felt awkward. Overall great restaurant and if I'm in Phoenix, i'll be by to have more tasty food! :) (We had the dinuguan, lechong kawali, kare kare, pancit malabon i think, sisig and crisp pata) yep and all of them good!",

At first the quality and portion servings were good,but the price is not well worth it with the small portions of food they serve you now.  Last time I was at Casa, I ordered Kare Kare, it was like 7-8 bucks and it only had 3 pieces of meat in it. Sames goes for the Menudo. I ate with three people, we ordered Menudo, Kare Kare, Pancit and two other items that I can't remember plus three Pepsi sodas. The whole bill came up to almost 85 bucks!!! I've been to other Filipino restaurants in Phoenix and spend 35 bucks for 4 people and had better experience in portions, servings and quality.  To add to this, the kare kare meat tasted odd, it was chewy and didn't taste fresh. I tried to give this place a couple of tries,but just can't enjoy it.   The only thing I love about this place is the Lecheon Kawali and the sinigang was acceptable. Not to mention the Sago Gulaman was really good.  Some of the dessert cakes are ok as well. The Yema was awful, did not taste anything like how I taste it in other Pinoy restaurants in Vegas, California and even home made ones I tried from family, friends etc.  You'll have to be a fan of this place to really enjoy the food. Its a very family oriented restaurant, service was really good and a friendly environment. They just have to improve on serving portions and quality of taste and they will be good.",

We both love the macapuno tart and the special halo-halo. This is a rare sit-down Filipino restaurant with friendly servers. The rest room is clean, complete with amenities like hair spray.

    "text": "Fellow Yelper Kurdy S and I were curious about this Pin@y bakery, so we met here for lunch during one weekend. Looking from right to left, the interior was divided into a bakery section followed by a sizable dining area. The vertical glass case carried an assortment of colorful Pin@y sweets, rolls, and desserts. Everything looked extremely tempting. The atmosphere was casual, down to earth, and unassuming.  The Chicken Adobo ($7.99) came with bone-in chicken, vinegar, soy sauce, and garlic. The chicken was tender and meaty, but the marinade could be deepened by the soy sauce and more striking with the mix of sharp flavors. For some reason, the expected flavors were flat and notes to plateau and climax were severely missing.  The Sisig ($7.99) encompassed diced pork and pork ears sauteed with garlic, onions, lemon juice, and fresh chopped jalapenos. Given all the sharp tasting ingredients, the flavors should have been far more robust, striking, and complicated. To the chef's credit, the positives were the food did not appear greasy; and the textures came out firm and not overcooked. The side of pancit was lacking flavor, and unfortunately, equally unimpressive. I've had all of these items homemade, so the experience was modest at best given this being one of the only two Pin@y bakeries in the area.  Ube Hopia ($4.99) was my least favorite item from the bakery. The exterior was noticeably staled without the fresh flaky textures. Although the purple ube filling was delicious, the air pocket inside was too big for me to recommend it. To this day, my favorite Pin@y bakery is still Valerio's.  Despite the limitations, the Sago't Gulaman ($2.50) was truly outstanding. It came in a big glass of tapioca, gelatin, and crushed ice. The drink was impressively refreshing to counteract against the hot summer weather. Of all the things I've tried so far, this is one item that I'd highly recommend.  Service was friendly and kind, but the food did take some time to arrive at our table. I still believe their food is a good gateway for those experiencing Pin@y cuisine for the first time. However, their targeted audiences could be much more inclusive of those who have already been introduced to the cuisine. I'd be interested in trying the other Filipin@ restaurant in the area before deciding whether to return.",

But the focus is on the food not trying to be more then a hole in the wall restaurant and bakery. Tv was playing the Filipino station go figure. Appetizer came out quickly. Best part was it tasted the most authentic lumpia that I have tasted in the valley.  Main coarse came out chicken adobo with rice and noodles. Now I choose this because 1 this is one of my favorite dishes to make my self and reminds me of growing up. If I had a last meal it would be chicken adobo. How did this compare... Close real close and to be fair to compare what you make at home is a little unfair because you know exactly how you like it. What was great it was full pieces of chicken bone in not cafeteria how many pieces can you make a chicken leg. Rice is rice so it was good. But the real surprise was the noodles. They tasted great. Chicken tender and flavorful just not like mine.   I enjoyed the food so much I want to bring my grandfather and see what he says. And maybe it can remind him of home.",

    "text": "As you enter you pass a small baked goods shop and enter a banquet hall like dining room. I'm not real familiar with Filipino food and asked our waiter what spices are used in the Chicken Inasal. He said, \"I don't know but it's a good choice.\" I order it anyway and then our waiter starts SINGING KARAOKE. Starting with \"Love is a many splendid thing\" followed by many Frank Sinatra tunes. He sings well and it is kinda neat but a little weird.  Someone runs my husband's plate out. I wait at least ten minutes and then someone runs my plate out. Both meals had a very home style quality to them. Both had falling apart tender meat that was infused with flavors. The Beef Kalderetta tasted like a beef stew that anyone's grandmother would make but with two french fries instead of potatoes. The Chicken Inasal was a whole chicken leg on the bone that was marinated and grilled and served with a vinegar-soy kind of sauce for dipping.  The baked goods look inviting to us and I read on the Phoenix New Times that these baked goods are among the Best in the Phoenix Area so I wanted to try some.  We ordered the mango and ube (purple yam) tarts to try. A waitress brings them and I notice a big crack on the purple tart and it looks very dry. We try to eat them but neither of us can PENETRATE the tarts with a fork because they are very hard. My husband breaks them open with his hands and they are hard like rocks and are inedible. We bring this to the attention of the waitress and she says the manager will talk to us. He brings out one new purple tart and says nothing is wrong with his tarts and they just needed to be warmed up. I think to myself well then who is suppose to warm them up? Am I suppose to bring my own personal oven with me when I go out to eat? The new tart he brought over was good unlike the first tarts. Our hard mango tart just stayed on the table. We get the bill then pay and leave. The manager runs after us and says that we didn't have to pay for the desserts. That sort of rubbed us the wrong way because nobody took the desserts off the bill and nobody told us we didn't have to pay for them.  If you come here you need to be a telepathic to know what they don't tell you and you need to bing your own personal oven if your desserts are served hard.  You might want to give this place a try but I certainly can't recommend getting dessert.",

Love the Food, the lumpia, kare-kare, lechon kawali, pancit malabon, spaghetti and others - lots of authentic Filipino food to choose from.     I've been to a few Filipino restaurants in Phoenix, some of them have come and gone, but by far, Casa Filipina has been consistent.   I also feel that this is by far the Cleanest Filipino restaurant i have seen here in the Valley.   We all know how some of them are.  I'm not overly critical about the less salt, less garlic or less stuff -  being a restaurant located in the U.S. - you have to learn to adopt, most American's won't eat food with too much salt, or too much garlic or too much of things.    That's what the table salt is for.  I grew up in the Philippines for 20 years, and have lived in the U.S. for 20 years - i don't like too much shrimp on my food, nor do I want to eat anything too salty or with too much garlic. Casa makes their food in the perfect balance of just making it \"right.\"   Even my non-filipino wife eats the food here.  I brought a few non-filipino friends to this place and they all love the food.",

The sauce in the dish had good flavor, too bad the meat was just too dry to eat. My main issue with this place was the service. We were seated for about 15 minutes before anyone came to get our drink order and it's a small restaurant. Once we (table of 3) ordered our food, all our dishes came out at different times...up to ten minutes apart from each other. You had to eat before everyone got their food or your food would get cold.Food is ok, but the service was dismal. The service is the reason for such a low review.",

    "text": "Been here twice... Been disappointed twice... So this deserves twice the star.  Sorry 'kababayan' ! I hope you can take this constructive feedback to become a better representation of our food.   I can proudly say that I know Filipino food. I think I have some credentials. Being a Filipino and growing-up in Philippines surrounded by good and authentic Filipino food should give me enough basis for my feedback and critic.  Let's start with the good. Place was clean and it did not have the oily and fishy smell of a usual Asian restaurant. Service was good. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. Food was also served quick and at the right temperature. The Halo-halo had a good balance of sweetness and creaminess. The Leche Flan on top of the Halo-halo had the firm and velvety like consistency that is common to a Filipino Leche Flan. The sweet Taro at the bottom gave the dessert a genuine Filipino flavor. Even the shaved ice is a positive. It is really easy to ruin a Halo-halo with brick like sizes of ice. The Sago't Gulaman was also really good. I got ahint of vanilla on every sweet sip and the jello had its own characterand flavor. The Tapioca balls was made the star of the drink with just the right bite but had the softness common to  a tapioca back home in the Philippines.   Now the bad. It breaks my heart that I am criticizing a Filipino restaurant but I love Filipino food so much, I just want to make sure it is represented well.  I would have wanted some water. I believe water should still be served even if our order had Halo-Halo and Sago't Gulaman. We also got a little bit of a funky smell on our Pancit Malabon (common to improperly stored rice noodles/sauce). Knowing what a really freshly cooked Pancit Malabon smells like, I just know that the sauce or the noodles on my order may have not been handled properly. Since I have already mentioned the Pancit Malabon, I might as well finish my review of the could have been noodle delight. The pancit flavor was very very very flat. It was very far from the layers of salty, sweet, garlicky, seafood umami flavor. I was saddened by the lack of seafood (got maybe 3-4 smal shrimps). The crunch from the pork rind was none existent. I was also looking for the smoked fish saltiness that makes Pancit Malabon a pancit from Malabon.   I have tried their adobo and caldereta on my last visit. Both fell very short on flavor and character. A little more salt and pepper and maybe a lot more garlic might make difference.   I've tried their Crispy Pata as well. Which I think was AWESOME!   There are some goods, but I've had more bads during my previous visits. I just wish Filipino food can be represented a little better. I wish the layers of flavors and texture present in each bite of a Pinoy dish comes out the next time I visit the restaurant I have been trying to love.",

Tasted good but I wish there was more to it. It was basically all noodles with very little vegetables and chicken. More veggies would have been great. I didn't care for more chicken because it was dry. The dish came with a side of bread. It had the consistency of a moist cornbread. 3/5  - Chicken Adobo: 3 pieces of boned-in chicken with marinated with garlic, soy sauce, and vinegar. Served with white rice. The chicken was flavorful and tender. 4/5  Service: The waitress was friendly and polite. One of the ladies from the back, I'm not sure if she was the owner or the chef, came out to greet us and asked how our food was. She thanked us for coming and wished to see us back again.

Last week, we ordered:  * Lechon Kawali: good; loved that it was super-crispy! * Filipino Bistek: ummm... tasted like Beef Stew, with gravy and all - not the oily-soy-saucy thing that you'd normally see with Bistek * Lumping Shanghai: a little bland, but not too bad * Garlic Rice: s'okay * Halo-Halo: delicious, sweet enough, and had lots of ingredients * Sago't Gulaman: yum!  Took home the following: * Cassava cake: pretty good * Bibingka: so bland (and I was particularly looking forward to this). I had to sprinkle sugar on it to make it taste better. * Yema: they mixed langka in it; not bad * Tiramisu cup: Eeek! This is not what Tiramisu tastes like! Son and I each had a bite and threw it away. * Chocolate Mousse: same as the Tiramisu, we ended up throwing this away after one bite.  We'll most likely come back, since there aren't a lot of Filipino places around.",

I don't open bags when delivering, just ask the restaurant if all food is in the bag. When I delivered to customer they told me it was missing half the order. I called the restaurant on my way back and they said they did not scroll all the way down to see all of order. When I got there he said oh let me go back and get it. Another wait while they finished preparing the rest of the order. There were maybe 4 customers in the whole place. I noticed that some flan syrup had spilled in the bag I brought back to ensure the customer got their complete order this time and I had asked him if he could please clean up the bag so it would not be that way when I delivered it again to the customer. He said oh the bag must have been tipped to the side when delivering it. I assured him it was not tipped over by me in the ride in the car or when handing it to the customer, but maybe by the customer when she began looking at the contents in the bag. He acted as if it was a problem cleaning up the bag. He even had the nerve to remind me not to tip it while delivering it by showing me how to carry it. I Know I never tipped it in the first place as the customer handled the bag while checking over the order. The problem lays in the fact they did not ensure they provided the customers entire paid order in the first place. I had to make 2 trips to provide the customer their order. Delivery drivers should not open the bags to check the contents as that is the restaurants job. Restaurants want to stay open then they need to make sure they have great food and great customer service. I will never deliver for this place again as they have horrible customer service.",

They were all great dishes! Seasoned just right! The adobo is amazing. I liked the fried garlic topping. Nice touch.  The lunch experience was awesome.

    "text": "I've only lived in AZ a little over a year. Coming from San Diego, one of the things I miss most is my Filipino food. I wasn't surprised that the Filipino restaurants were scarce here. So when I had the opportunity to go to one, I did my research to figure out which one I wanted to try. I am so happy that I choose Casa Filipina because it was absolutely DELICIOUS!   I consider myself a foodie. Went to culinary school and did my stint in this industry. So needless to say...I'm a little picky. I knew I wanted to try their lumpia shanghai because my son's birthday was the following day. I was trying to determine whether or not I was going to make my own for the party or order through them. Thankfully they were incredible! It brought me so much comfort eating them. PLUS, when I ordered 100 of them for my son's 5th birthday party the next day, they were a HIT! No one at the party had ever had lumpia before. And I think it made a pretty good impression that they would never forget it.  The other thing I ordered was Pancit Bihon. Just the day before, my husband and I were discussing how we have never had a really good pancit bihon back in San Diego--unless, of course, it was home made. My first bite of this and I was in heaven! Finally a flavorful pancit bihon that, one bite of, I stopped and texted my husband, my sister and my mom-in-law, on how amazingly delicious it was! I plan to order the pancit and the bihon for my other son's 1st birthday in just a few weeks.  The third thing I ordered was the Bistek. Now I have to preface my thoughts on this dish with how my family members are incredible cooks. I grew up on Bistek and my sister bangs this out of the park. So when I first saw how thick the sauce was, more like a gravy, it intrigued me. I'm used to a thinner sauce. I didn't let that dissuade me. After I took a bite, my first thought was how tender the meat was...tender like butter practically. Then when I got to analyzing the flavor, it wasn't the distinct soy sauce and pungent lemon tang I'm used to. It was good, but I guess I just preferred my sister's approach to it more.   I had to end my meal with Halo-Halo because it's my fave--I intentionally ordered as much as I did, so that I had some to take home to the hubby for dinner. The Halo-Halo did not disappoint. My only feedback would be for it to be in a bigger cup because mine was SO full of goodness, that I couldn't stir everything together. Tony, the owner, was even sweet enough to come out and ask me if it had been my first time eating Halo-Halo because I wasn't mixing everything together. Which is the perfect segway to the service...  I didn't realize how much I was missing the interaction with my culture. As soon as I was greeted in tagalog, my heart was happy and I think I had the biggest smile on my face. My server was super sweet and attentive. Tess even came out and served my check. Thanked me for coming in. But it was Tony who went out of his way to make sure I was truly experiencing a Halo-Halo, the way it should be. He even offered to stir it all up for me. After I told him that this wasn't my first rodeo, I explained how the cup was just too full.   I can't wait to return and bring my entire family!!!",

For those who haven't had ube before, the best way I can describe it is a sweet potato/taro flavor.  They used a whipped cream based icing, so the cake was light and wasn't toothachingly sweet like your typical American cakes too.  I recommend ordering the cake a few days in advance, as it looks much more vibrant than the one on display.  Overall, this place is a solid bakery that I would order cake from again!",

The food was great, simple but not simple on flavor. They wait on you practically hand and foot. There was an electric keyboard in the corner of the room, and behind it was an older quiet gentleman playing Over The Rainbow and a few others everyone would know. It was peaceful. I can see why this place is visited so frequently.   A man approached my niece and asked her name. She immediately became the shy flower she is and closed up and began getting upset. We responded for her, and he offered a song just for her.  Well, you can imagine what happened. Poor little lady started crying. But no worries, it was a very sweet gesture. And Ill always remember it.   Of course my niece forgot her trauma as soon as she caught a glimpse of the bakery shelves. Oh dear. She picked out her prize, a chocolate mousse tower. An even exchange for her tears, right?   She devoured it within moments and was incredibly happy.   If you haven't been here yet. You must. They treat you like family.",

They were very informative, helpful, and funny when going through the menu and answering questions about the food whilst I learned about the dishes. I will definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to anyone. PS an an inside hint about this gem of a restaurant. .. the owners/chefs have been in charge of kitchens in Beverly Hills Hilton and Phoenix, so this is five star food w/o the five star price.  Oh and the bake goods are awesome!",

Binagoongang - great , fresh,, a little too pungent for me to bring to work and eat in the office, but none the less deliciouso. Ate it in my car in the office parking lot..  Beef Kaldereta - also Great adn the  veggies fresh,, only down side was potatoes easily turned to mush when trying to fork them :P..  Only 3 miles from work will go here weekly..  Last trip Pork Menudo - Meat and flvors awesome,, this time the veggies seemed a little dehydrated, well the carrots.. but that didnt hinder from the dish being great.  Will be back.... Please oh Please add Pork Adobo to the menu or humba ?:P  See you next week at Casa Filipina !! Kain Tayo!",

In the interest of full disclosure, I am a Filipino who grew up in the Philippines and migrated to this great country when I was 24. I love Filipino food and would go out of my way to get some. With that out of the way, I was really disappointed with this restaurant. I was hoping to love it and find a regular place to eat at. My family and I checked it out over the weekend in search of a Pinoy place to order our Christmas eve meal from. Sad to say, this did not fit the bill. We ordered the pancit malabon, pork barbecue skewers, and an array of desserts. None of them were up to par.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place out for a few months now, so finally last Friday my mom & I decided to come here for lunch.   When you walk in your eyes are immediately drawn to all the goodies in the bakery case. But we were here for lunch so we brought our attention back to that. We were seated in the dining room that was pretty empty, there were only 3 other parties. After scanning the menu we ordered the following to share: lumpia (crunchy pork eggrolls), pancit (rice noodles w/veggies & chicken that came w/puto-a sweet rice bread) & ginatang sitao kalabasa (string beans, squash & shrimp sauteed in coconut milk w/rice). The lumpia was amazing, so yummy! The pancit was delicious as well, great flavor. The veggie dish was my least favorite, however my mom loved it. Oh I also did not care for the puto.   After we finished lunch we looked at all the treats again & decided to order some to go. I can't recall what my mom got but I got the following: cannoli, flan, cheese roll & siopao (steamed bbq bun). The cannoli was for my hubby & he enjoyed it. The flan was yummy but had a much thicker consistency than I am used to. I did not care for the cheese roll at all, I think if the cream cheese had some sugar added to it it would be much better. I had the siopao for lunch today & it was pretty good.   After chatting with the owners (very sweet, husband & wife) we found out they offer line dancing every Saturday for $8. My mom loves to dance & is going to check it out this Saturday with a couple girlfriends. If she has fun I might even join her next time!",

    "text": "The fiance and I were on a mission to surround ourselves with some comforts from home since we were unable to be home with our families in Cali on Easter. We decided to find a Filipino restaurant and see if it could compare to our mom's famous cooking (nothing ever does though, right?)  We had the choice between Casa Filipina and Halo Halo Kitchen which are only a few blocks apart. For no known reason we decided to go with CF if only for the fact that it was closest to us at the time. This is not in our home area so it's unfamiliar territory for us but we ventured on until we found it in a run of the mill shopping plaza with a Big Lots (a nice bonus since it was actually open on Easter so we got to do some after lunch browsing).  We didn't know what to expect from CF but we know we weren't disappointed. The small bakery opens up into a pretty good sized restaurant with a good amount of tables. There were several other parties there including what looked like an after church Easter family gathering of about 12. Good sign #1.  We were greeted warmly and seated right away. We were surprised at the menu choices and excited about the options they had. Of course, there are some Filipino dishes we wished they had but hey, you can't have everything. What they did have was pretty darn good.  We ordered the sisig [see-sig] (sauteed bits of pork with onions) and the pancit malabon [pon-sit muh-law-bone] (noodles with sauce, hard boiled eggs, shrimp and cruched chicharon, or pork rind chips, on top). I also got sago to drink (sweet syrupy drink with tapoica pearls and sweet rice jelly) b/c it made me think fondly of family parties when my dad would always make a punch bowl of the stuff.   The food was flavorful and offered good portion sizes. It came with a hefty scoop of white rice, naturally. The entrees also come with a piece of sweet rice bread called puto - i know, i know, not the best name for those of you who speak Spanish but that's what it's called, really! Random factoid: I learned this little double meaning when I got in trouble in 3rd grade for bringing puto to my class for the multicultural pot luck. Much explaining was done at that time too so I figured I'd include it here. Just an FYI.  One thing to note is that the food will take a little while to come out so be prepared. The server warned us in advance and was very apologetic about the wait but I have to say this....every Filipino restaurant I have been to that has heat lamps and premade food has been wrong on so many levels. Legit Filipino food is not quick to make and not good when you make it in large batches and just have it sit there waiting for someone to order it. So, just be patient and know that it's worth the wait.   Since we are constantly trying new places we will surely be trying other Filipino joints in the area but we will also be going back to CF for some good food to make us feel at home.",

I've also purchased a few items from their bakery (attached to the restaurant). They had a flat screen facing the restaurant wall on the Filipino channel. That's probably my most favorite thing about this place. It is quite entertaining. One star off for the pricing of the meat selection on their menu. The rice portions outweigh the meat by 60%. I had white rice left over and a little pork left. Overall, very traditional, inviting, and I hope they open another one up soon in the Glendale area part of town :)))",

Their dishes are best enjoyed with an open mind, as you won't see items such as pork chocolate blood soup on your average restaurant menu. I've been here several times and the owner, who seats you herself is very nice and friendly. My favorite dish here is the Lechon Kawali which is a deep fried pork belly dish served with a liver sauce. Their desserts are also amazing, my personal favorites are the Halo-Halo and pretty purple ube mousse tarts. They also have live music on the weekends which is also so fun to hear a Filipino-style crooner. The delicious, authentic food and wonderful ambiance will keep you coming back to this restaurant again and again.",

But I am use to a little spicier but for the price it's well worth it.  Also had their flan and jackfruit pastries in the bakery section, those seemed to be freshly made that same day. They had a huge selection in both the restaurant and bakery, I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "Masarap!!  I was craving Filipino food and Casa Filipina had come highly recommended from our Kuya.  Firstly, once we entered, we were promptly greeted by EVERYONE in the bakery! That really set the tone for the rest of our dining experience. Once seated, we ordered Bistek Tagalog, Chicken Adobo, and Lechon Kawali. I really wanted Tosilog, but I knew there was no way I could finish it ha ha ha!  Bistek Tagalog: Delicious! Beef was tender, the gravy was flavorful and thick, and it was topped with 2 potato slices and onions.   Chicken Adobo: this is a common dish and one I always recommend to people who have never tried Filipino food. Here, the adobo was soft and tender. The sauce was savory and gravy like, which is my fav!   Lechon Kawali: very crispy and fatty (in a good way). The liver sauce was soooo good! Did I mention, crispy?   For dessert, we got halo-halo to go and it came with flan on top! Yum! Can't go wrong with halo-halo!   Service: impeccable!! Each waitress was extremely friendly and VERY attentive! Our water was refilled plenty of times and she even brought us more rice when it ran low.  All in all, considering I grew up eating Filipino food, I'd say this was easily one of the best Filipino restaurants I've ever eaten at!! I felt right at home and welcome, like I had gone to a Tita's house and she cooked some bomb Filipino food. Ha ha!! When I'm in town, I will definitely be back!",

A friendly advice-don't compare their fresh lumpia to the one you had back in Phil.or never put an expectation as they have a diff.version.  -Bangsilog: it is so yummy plus they have this unique vinegar, and 2 eggs :-) worthe the pay.  More than 5 stars for the service, met \"Tess\" and she accomodated me and provided my needs. Always ask if I'm doing ok and if i need anything and she wears a \"SMILE\" that makes your day enlightened.  Really never had a best service like this before. Will definitely come back!!!

The service was friendly and awesome as well!

There were two women working at the front. Neither of which greeted me. It was dead, so a bit awkward to have no customer service. Alas, I had two children in tow who wanted sweets. They had tiramisu, chocolate mousse, tarts, and various Filipino goodies that looked beautiful. On the far left side there were three 12 inch cakes. The icing had cracks in it, from obviously sitting there for a period of time. Upon further inspection, one of the baked goods were covered in MOLD in their glass case. I was mortified and high tailed it out of there. I am disappointed that I will not be able to try their baked goods, but they lost a customer and a lot of trust that their food would be safe to eat.",

    "text": "My friend and I are going to school in Arizona and we're missing some authentic Filipino cooking from home. We found Casa Filipina on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We loved it so much that we came back today (we went yesterday also). The owners are very welcoming and inviting. We were seated quickly and our orders were taken as soon as we were ready. We both got meals that come with pancit and rice. My friend got the bangus which came with a dipping sauce, tomato, and cucumber. I got the sinagang na baboy and lechon kawali. The food came out really quick considering the bangus needed to be fried. My friend said her fish was cooked beautifully and evenly (because some places don't cook it evenly.) The sinagang na baboy has very good flavor, the meat was very tender, and the vegetables were nice and fresh. The lechon kawali was nice and crisp on the outside and juicy on the inside. Today when we went my friend loved the bangus so much that she got it again. I got the kare kare and, like the sinagang, the meat was so tender. They gave so much meat in the portions also!  Onto the bakery part: we got ube cheesecakes that were amazing. I also got the casava, but have not tried it yet. All of their pastries and baked goods look very scrumptious and I hope to try everything in their pastry case and menu in the future when I come again.  TL;DR - Come here if you're craving some authentic Filipino food.",

Filipino restaurants in the Phoenix area are slim so most of the time, you just have to go with what you got regardless of quality and taste.   I came to visit and even though the decor needed some updating and the a/c was out, the food made up for it. We ordered Shanghai lumpia, chicken adobo, and pancit malabon. Every bite was masarap (delicious)!! I was so freaken happy that I also got halo halo, pan de sal, and ube pastries to go. What was also great was the price - for everything I ordered and with tip, I paid $50. We left with leftovers and yummy bakery goods so I really think it was worth it! The employees (owners) were also so sweet and they hope I will come again.   I will definitely come back and I invite all of you reading this right now to come and try it out!

We did not want to wait until noon for lunch as we had a craving for a non-traditional brunch, meaning without eggs or bread, but with rice and pancit.  Filipino food, for non-Asians or non-Filipinos, is a derivation of other Asian foods, you get rice, noodles, tasty stews of pork, beef, or chicken.  Also Roast Pork!  In this case, Roast Pork Belly because not many establishments have a facility or enough requests to roast an entire pig daily.  But, oh well, Roast Pork Belly will do!  Our family is ethnic Chinese but similar to other Asians or Pacific Islanders, we'll eat anything.   So for breakfast, we had Kara Kare (curry pork with eggplant), Chicken Adobo (they serve a toned down version, they give you a side of amped-up shrimp paste which you can add to the adobo), and Lechon Kawali (Roast Pork Belly with a liver based sweet dipping sauce).  Each dish comes with rice and pancit.  Too much food for the three of us, so our son boxed it up for dinner.  The place is also a bakery - we ordered Ube Cheese Rolls and regular Cheese Rolls to go.  The rolls were good and flaky with the right amount of filling.  Tess, the owner, said the rolls were just out of the oven.  She is so nice and helpful!  We told her we were driving back to NorCal after moving our son into school and she offered assistance to check on him - so nice.  Island hospitality!  Will be back in October to visit!",

    "text": "This review is for the bakery only!  Fresh off my yearly trek to Manila, I was craving a taste of home. And what does home taste like? Ube and leche flan, apparantly.  Cue Casa Filipina Bakeshop and Restaurant.  I ran in at 1pm on a Saturday and ordered a halo-halo special, plus ube halaya roll and an ube cheese tart. The halo-halo took about 5-8 minutes to prepare. No worries, because I moseyed over to the dining area so I could watch TFC on the TV.  The halo-halo special was DELISH. The leche flan was such a nice touch. And they didn't go ham on the jellies. Honestly, I typically hate halo-halo because the jelly ratio is always TOO DAMN HIGH. This one, however, was just right.  I stored my ube baked goods in the fridge to be consumed later that evening.  The ube cheese tart was divine. I would definitely repurchase - I love the cheesy taste combined with the ube. The ube halaya roll was decent - I would have liked a little bit more ube, but still good. I love the ube crumbs on top too.  If I didn't live so far away.. I would come more often just so I could have a little taste of home. (And to bring home some ube treats too.)",

My total just for the lechon kawali alone was $13! 1lb of pork belly at the market is less than $3/lb & from what I ordered, it only weighted out to be like half a pound of pork.   When I got to the place to pick up my order, I had to wait at least 15 more minutes for it to be done. Their excuse was that there were many orders placed before mine. there was no more than 8 people dining in at the time. Keep in mind that when I arrived to pick up my food, I had places an order 20 mins before. Finally, when my order was ready I went up to the counter to pay. & the person who rung me up just kept staring at me. It made me very very very uncomfortable.   The Lechon Kawali overall was not the best. Very bland. The sauce that it came with didn't even make it any better. It did have that perfect crunch I was looking for though.",

    "text": "This is a great option to experience the unique, exotic flavors of the Philippines.  Our party of five ordered several things from the menu, including Shanghai lumpia, pancit bihon, crispy pork lechon, pinakbet beef calderata, and of course chicken adobo, and we shared all family style.  The dishes were prepared and presented nicely, coming from the kitchen over a short period of time.  The serving sizes are a bit lean given the pricing, but nonetheless we were all happily satiated at the end of dinner.  The host/servers did not hover, but were readily available and responsive when we needed something.  It was a very friendly and relaxing atmosphere.  While we did not order anything from the bakery on this trip, I have previously stopped by the bakery to buy Filipino treats.  The taste of cassava, ube, coconut, mango, and various other exotic flavors proliferate the large selection of desserts.  The Filipino sweet breads are hard to find in Phoenix, but they are here at your fingertips.  Overall, it is a FILIPI-YES to this Filipino restaurant.",

Thank goodness for Casa Filipina!  It's a 25 mins drive from OT Scottsdale, but at least it's a decent go-to for home cooked Filipino food.  Super simple resto - but clean.  We had a couple of the chicken dishes, the beef steak and squid.  Overall the food was tasty and service decent.  My tip:  if you have big appetites, order extra.    Because it is such a trek for us, I also ordered food to go for \"baon\", fried tilapia, pancit malabon (Filipino style egg noodles) and tortang talong (omelette with eggplant and pork).  Equally enjoyed these dishes at home!  Of the 6 Filipino restaurants I've come to learn about so far, I recommend this restaurant for Filipinos and folks who have yet to try Filipino food alike. We will definitely return when in need for a fix",

I have also tried the chicken inasal, which was super juicy and had great flavoring. The portions are great. While there I met the owners who where super friendly. They have a lot of sweets too which I haven't tried any yet but def will be with time. I know the flan is amazing since they put that in the halo halo, seriously some of the best flan I have had too.

We had completely different dishes, the Pork BBQ on Skewers is just tender, they managed to keep it moist inside, it's sweet and savory at the same time.  I went for the Chicken Inasal which a special spice blend, Tess, one of the owners came by chatting with us, she said it's has a blend of lemon grass on it.  The skin is so crispy, the spices caramelize into the meat gives this umami taste.  Don't leave without having some of their bake products.  Definitely try the Ube (Purple Yam) Cheese Cake.",

It was empty when we came in around 5 pm but they greeted us with the biggest smile on their face. Customer service was great which is why Im giving it a solid 3.   The food was okay. Coming from Virginia and being filipino myself My expectations were a bit high, too high because I just dont think Ive ever been to a filipino restaurant I didnt like. We ordered pancit, bistek, lumpia and sinigang. The portion was okay. More than most but a bit pricey from what Im used to with the same portion.  What disappointed me was their bakeshop. We ordered 4 ube mousse cake and we were so excited to get home to dig in and almost choked from the dryness of the cake. It really didn't taste like ube at all and I was a bit embarrassed since I brought my friends here specifically for the cake and it was a bust! We also drove 40 min to get here JUST FOR THE UBE CAKE. We also got the ube cheesecake and that was ok but wheres the dang ube flavor! So disappointed! Im so glad we didnt pay for the $44 6\" ube cake they had.   So in conclusion:  Customer service: 4 Food: 3 Dessert",

    "text": "When I travel, I always look for a Filipino resto just like this one that serve authentic Filipino dishes. This was the closest to me at the time. Hubs and I had to wait an hour bcs they were opening late according to their kind note that was posted on the window.   Hubs and I were the very first customers. We ordered several favorites.  The one that stood out the most is the sinigang.  It was simply made with basic veggies but was tasty enough to say \"yum\". The rest are forgettable.  The lechon kawali was very dry and overcooked in my opinion.     We also ordered the kare-kare and it was just okay because they didn't cook or make their own fried shrimp paste.  Kare-kare is sort of like some mild type of curry which, has the peanut butter base that should have a Really pretty orange-ee color to it. What really makes this dish special is to make your own fried shrimp paste that gives this dish the deliciousness that will present your originality and will make it more memorable to customers.   This is how I also remember my trips- where I had one of my favorite dish and where it took place. This goes for the other types of dining or eating I do on my own or with my love ones.  Anyway, on a good note, the perk was that we were given a lot of steam rice and pancit with our dishes.  You can google pancit if you are not familiar.   Service was very pleasant, it's well-maintained and very clean if you ask me.  That is also important and people remember as well.  Otherwise, I think they do have a favorite dish that might stand out for others. Who knows!? Prices on the menu? Well they vary...",

I highly recommend the lumpia, the lechon kawali, and dinuguan. If you're unsure about what to order, just ask Tess. She was so friendly and introduced us to the menu; that kind of personal touch was greatly appreciated.   P.S. save room for their desserts! They have so many different kinds, and everything I tried was delicious. Don't sleep on them.  P.P.S. I've been reading some negative reviews about the tarts from customers complaining they can't cut through the tart. Apparently they didn't have the common sense to pick the tarts up and bite into them. Do not skip the tarts. Our coconut tart was my favorite dessert of the three we ordered!!!",

The chicken inasal was quite plain. The bbq skewers were good, but not the best.   It's nice that the dishes come with white rice and a side of plain pancit.   Overall, it was an average experience.

Don't let the generic strip mall exterior deter you. Very friendly service and you can tell the place becomes a karaoke bar at certain times. The owner came and talked to us a few times and she enjoyed that we knew a bit about Filipino food already. Not sure about the one review that says they people running it didn't look Filipino but when we were there, they definitely were.  Anyway, I had the kare kare which the owner recommended. Was delicious especially with the shrimp brine dip. Yum!! So good especially with the garlic rice. Friend had the lechon kawali, which was so delicious and tender!! Great food we had here.

I worked with a guy who was in charge of hiring for a drug wholesaler, he liked helping friends and family. He was a Polish Filipino. Some of the family he hired were Filipino and would bring Pancit, Lumpia, adobo etc to the potluck type lunches we had. I would even go to family functions with them. I love Filipino food.   There was a place near me that closed down and I was left with no where to go. I drove past CFB but at the time it was only a bakery...lame   After seeing the review for the place in Chandler, I had to find a closer place. SO I YELPED... sure enough there it was CFB. It is only 6 miles from work...sweet.   I roll in and expect to see a dive but instead see a very clean, and larger then expected dining room. Attached was a bakery full of delights.   I ordered the Pancit with chicken and veggies. It was freaking good. No soy or spicy sauce ALL the normal flavors. I also asked if I could sample some of the Lumpia and it was perfect, fresh, hot, and awesome.   I will be back for some Adobo and some pastry's.   They have karaoke on Friday, and a live band on Saturday. So you are warned.",

    "text": "I hate having to give out three star reviews. For me, 1-star isn't the worst possible rating you can an establishment, a 3 is. Because 3 stars means it invoked no reaction to you, neither joy or disgust, no pleasure or pain.   I'd rather eat at a really shitty place that I'll remember than a so-so eatery that I'll forget the moment I get back into my truck.  If I want mediocre \"take it or leave it\" food I'll just cook for myself, kthxbye.  As BFeF's (Best Frienemies Forever), Clarice W and I frequently have lunch together in the Peoria area. The decision on what to eat is usually made using the following criteria: Where haven't we been that we can yelp about?  Our last lunch involved us going to Hope Kee and getting all wrapped up in their cutesy snack section and coming in late to work. So we needed somewhere relatively closer with no Hello Kitty gummi lips to distract us from our voyage back.  Clarice suggested Casa Filipina, a Filipino place by the Lenny's Burger somewhere near but not necessarily 35th Avenue.  We were welcomed in by the staff and taken immediately to a nice cozy table by the window. We were given our menus by the excited and talkative waiter I would come later to know as \"that fucking guy\".   At first I was a little troubled reading the menu. I was once in a relationship with a Filipino girl that was so tumultuous and unloving that when I seriously thought of breaking up with her that my first thought \"but  man, I love her mother's cooking...\".   But aside from the adobo and lumpia, I saw nothing else on the menu that I could recall from all those awkward awkward family dinners.  I can't tell if this means there's more to the cuisine than I'm aware of or that said ex's mother was, as well as a good cook, a fucking liar.   Either way, I'm glad I left her in the end anyway.  I ordered the Dinguan, which translates as \"chocolate pork\".  Don't be fooled by the name, all you saucy foodies out there thinking of that Iron Chef America where they made savory dishes with chocolate.  Chocolate pork is actually pork cooked in pig's blood.   I'll repeat that.  It's pig's blood. It's called \"chocolate pork\" because the blood takes on a brownish-black hue after it's been cooked.  After hearing this from that fucking guy, Clarice changed her original order (we even order the same thing! aren't we just the cutest!) to the Bistek Tagalog, which she was familiar with and knew she would like.  All the entries come with at CFB is a side of ride. I'm not sure if it's jasmine, white, or saffron, because I always opt for noodles when given the option.   And if you get that fucking guy, that rice doesn't even come with soy sauce. After serving us, he disappeared into the bakery, talking it up with some of the other customers. Clarice didn't get her soy sauce until after we had finished our entrees and were on our second helping of rice.   Thankfully my chocolate pork came with a lot of sauce and I was able to dribble it on my rice.   That's right, muchachos. We trannies prefer blood on our rice. You think about that the next time you try to tell us what bathrooms we can use, amigo.  I couldn't taste the pork. All I tasted was the blood. They could've just dumped a quart of blood on my rice and called it a day. The texture was nice though.  Clarice wasn't as fortunate with her dish. While I've tried to stay away from beef (it's enough of a commitment to keep my vegetarian brother off my back but not interfere with my eating habits), I had some of the Bistek, and it was passable. It reminded me of beef jerky, with its dry spicy roughness. Good, but not sure if that's how it's meant to taste.  Moral of the story: Clarice's entree did NOT make its own gravy, which made eating her rice a little inconvenient.   And seriously, JUST rice (really good rice, but seriously, how hard is it to make good rice)? Even my neighborhood so-poor-it-steals-its-recipes-from-other-restaurants Chinese place gives you an eggroll or wonton with your meal.   As the place is so fucking proud of its desserts, we ordered some. Clarice got the Creme Brulee and I got the mango tart. That fucking guy was in the middle of bringing Clarice her spoon when he caught the attention of another customer, so we sat for a good few minutes waiting to dig in. In the meantime, I managed to come up with a name for the color of the filling in my tart : burnt earwax.   My tart was about as tasty and edible as that term would imply.  Clarice's creme brulee was good, albeit a little cold by the time that fucking guy came with her spoon.  On our way out I learned that the bill had to be over 10 dollars before they would accept debit.  After I imagined beating every one of the staff near to death with a rolling pin, I got an eclair to go.  What I got was a bunch of whipped cream between two pieces of rock-hard pastry that you'd get at Fry's. Essentially, a diabetes sandwich.  Casa Filipina isn't good. But it's not bad.  That's the proble",

    "text": "I live in a town where I can find 5 Filipino restaurants in a 5 mile radius. So when I came to Phoenix for work, I wanted to see what the Filipino restaurant scene was like.  Like the previous reviewer stated, there are very few Filipino eateries. The supermarket that I found on my GPS was closed, so I found this one on Yelp. Overall, I would recommend to go to support the local Filipino restaurant.  When you first walk in, you start in the bake shop area where you'll find cakes and pastries on display. I wasn't sure if I could seat myself, but I was greeted and seated. There were two other tables filled with about 8 people eating including myself. What concerned me is that 2 of the other folks were the only other Filipinos - as I tend to judge all ethnic restaurants by the number of people of the same ethnicity.  But that logic doesn't seem to work here were the demographics of Filipinos seems relatively low.  I was craving Sisig (grilled pork - which is my favorite at Ongpin in South San Francisco) - but they didn't have that. On the whiteboard, they had Sinigang na Baboy (pork) - so I figured I couldn't go wrong with one of my favorites.  Since I was here on business, I figured I'll order a few other things including the shanghai lumpia (eggrolls), Halo Halo, and topped it off with Hot Pandesal.  The Sinigang was served in a bowl with 3 pieces of boneless pork. The meat was very tender and you can pull it apart with a spoon and fork. The soup was a little on the salty side since they may have put a little more tamarind mix, but that I might just be a little oversensitive about my sodium intake.  I couldn't help but think that I was eating at home or a family friend's house. Included in the sinigang was spinach, string beans, eggplant, a small potato, and cut onions. What was missing was dikons (those white radish things). It wasn't bad, and it wasn't exceptionally delicious because nothing compares to home made sinigang. But this would be the next best thing. I ate all the meat, and had quite a few eggplants left.  The shanghai lumpia came out shortly afterwards. The portion was pretty large and I could have shared it with someone else. I didn't care for sauce that it came with. I wanted vinigar, but a filipino family came in and there was only one server.  If you ever had Halo Halo at Ongpin, you'd find this lacking. It is served it a large plastic cup. What was missing is the ube ice cream. In fact, there was hardly any ube in it. There was a spoonfull of the leche flan, but I didn't finish it.  I actually ordered the Pandesal later, this version was like two very large dinner rolls served with butter. The bread had a fresh out of the oven taste.  The restaurant section was clean, with standard fare dining. There was a large flatscreen tv with TFC playing.  Last week, when I ate there, they were just written about in the local paper, but I didn't get to read the review.  They accept Master Card and Visa, but not American express.  I would eat here again to try some of their other dishes not because I want to support my fellow Filipinos, but because the food is actually worth having again. I took some photos of each dish with my iPhone, so I'll have to figure out how to upload them.  This is actually my first review because I was hoping to read more about Philippine restaurants in the area, I only saw this one. So I figured, I should also contribute!",

    "text": "This is my second time at Casa Filipina. I was hoping that this would merit a 4, maybe even 5 star review, but alas, I was disappointed and even embarrassed that I suggested this place to a fellow yelper.   I raved to Jetta R., \"Oh this place is so cute! The food is amazing and the service was great! We should totally hit this place up for lunch.\"   We walk in the door and were treated like I was on my first visit. Seated, given menus and place mats; water and silverware were promptly produced.   We even had some of the curious dishes explained to us.   Just a note, the food was really good, the first (and second) time I ordered the Bistek Tagalog. This time I felt it was lacking juiciness and the meat was difficult to cut with a fork (but the first time I ordered this dish it was so succulent it melted in my mouth.)   One plus I didn't receive last time was the offer for a second helping of rice.   I asked for soy sauce and the waiter said he'd be right back, he disappeared and then started talking with another customer for 20 minutes.   Then Jetta and I decided to order dessert, it is a bakeshop after all!  I ordered the Creme Brule, but when they came to clean the table off I wanted to save my spoon. The gentleman (whom I think to be the owner) said that he would bring me a clean one. Jetta, being the lady she is decided to wait until my spoon arrived. After 10 minutes of waiting I told her to dig in, finally while taking food to another table, the owner apologized for forgetting about my spoon.   Usually I am one for forgiveness, but not when there are only four customers in your restaurant and Jetta and I are two of them.   I can't believe how I went from super impressed to completely devastated. I want to try you again CFB, but I just don't know.",

    "text": "Firstly, there are very few Filipino eateries in Phoenix, so I'll give props to this one here.  Located in the rear end of an old plaza on 35th ave. & Thunderbird, you might miss it, so drive, and you will find it in the corner between a furniture store and Abacus Inn.   Inside you will find amiable Filipinas that will greet and accomodate your current food cravings.   I ordered the Pancit Palabok and was familiar with the rice noodles covered with orange-colored sauce, scallion, shrimp, chicharon and an egg to top it off. Puto was also served on the side. Not bad.  My friend ordered shrimp sinigang. The broth was rightly acidic, infused with the natural juices of the whole shrimp (heads included...for those of you who care to know).   Due to time constraints, I was not able to try any of the \"sweets.\" I did spot some bibingka, an ube dessert, and some cassava...they also have other things like cannoli and cookies (but that's not the reason you're there.   I'll surely eat here again, and will revise this review.  But at the end, make sure to provide them with a \"salamat\", or thank you in return for their great effort to advertise Filipino delicacies, that Phoenix needs more of.",

The strength of this restaurant is that the dishes are not so greasy - but then again what 's the point of being filipino if you don't have high cholesterol or blood pressure? All kidding aside, I also love the bakeshop feature. Very mom and pop oriented. Great foods although I'd like to see a little more on the menu.",

    "text": "Have been here twice.  The first time, we bought a mango cake (size to feed 15 people).  It was delicious and not too moist, loaded with mangos.  Returned a few days ago for dinner and what an experience.  The staff and owner were very friendly.  Great atmosphere with a live jazz band on Friday night that took all of our requests!  We ordered Chicken Asado (braised chicken in special sauce), Kare Kare (stewed pork in peanut sauce), Lechon Kawali (deep fried pork fat), and Pancit (thin noodles) with chicken and veggies.  Also had Lumpias (deep fried egg rolls with pork filling) as appetizer.  Was very pleasantly amazed by the flavors of all the entrees.  One thing that stood out was that the lumpias and the lechon was not greasy at all.  What a special touch that was and I never had these before without it being greasy.  The entrees had very good portions for the price.  They were served hot with sides of white rice.  The menu selections made you want to try many things (if you had room but probably won't because of the generous portions).  For dessert...Halo Halo.  The ingredients satisfied your sweet cravings after dinner.  The flan on top of the Halo Halo...best I ever tasted!!!  It was not overly sweet, but light and smooth llike it should be...amazing!!!  If you haven't tried this place, you need to.  If you are a regular,...you know what I am talking about!",

A friend and I stopped by to check out their baked goods and were greeted by a super friendly gentleman at the counter. I ordered a coconut torte, a slice of purple cake for my son, a regular cheese roll and 2 Purple yam cheese rolls. My 4-yr old couldn't contain himself and wanted to gobble up his cake on the spot. We sat down and i tried my torte. Super hard, but it had a good flavor. Wouldn't buy again. My friend had my try her cheese roll and it was amazing!!! Perfect amount of sweetness. We decided to try some food while there. We all shared a plate of pacit and lumpia and were very happy with our selections. The woman who attended us was very sweet and friendly. Later in the day I tried my purple yam roll. Flaky and sweet with a slight hint of taste of cream cheese. I can only imagine how yummy they taste a few min after coming out of the oven... Will def come back to try the shrimp lumpia and chicken adobo in the future as well as get my fix of purple yam cheese rolls!",

    "text": "*This review is for the Bakeshop.*  Was in town, visiting my man for the weekend, and he was seriously craving Filipino food. Yelped it, and saw that there was Casa Filipina and Halo-Halo Kitchen. Because he wanted breakfast, we hit Halo-Halo Kitchen first...   ...And to rectify our experience at Halo-Halo, we came to Casa Filipina after.  We were greeted warmly by both employee and by, I think, one of the owners. We were going to pick up pastries to nosh on as we continued on our day's adventure. We picked up - cheese rolls, ube cheese rolls, ensaymadas and a halo-halo. Here's the breakdown: - Cheese rolls: SWEET HEAVENLY JESUS. These were insane!!! So good! Cannot describe in so many words how wonderful these were. Super fresh, sweet cheese filling from end to end, and considerably larger than Goldilocks'. You can instantly tell the difference on how fresh baked these were. We purchased 1/2 dozen to share with his roommates, and yeah, they never saw them... -Ube cheese rolls: Really good. Had a great ratio of ube to cheese, and really really tasty. -Halo-halo: Really, yum... just wish it had more ingredients. But that's just me. It was a lot of ice, and maybe a little less than 1/4 of cup of the mix -Ensaymada: Little disappointed in this one. I think I'm more used to it be a brioche type pastry with sugar, cheese and butter. This one was more of a heavier roll, and seemed a little stale. I warmed it up in the microwave to soften the bread and melt the cheese, but still tasted not-so-fresh.  We learned that they served breakast, and make their longanisa in house from the owner, and after those cheese rolls, we'll definitely be back!",

We had the sinigang na baboy, bistek tagalog, binagoongan and pinakbet, for desert we ordered the halo-halo and chocolate cake. They are delicious and the kids loved the halo-halo. Couldn't help eating too much rice with all those food. While eating we were entertained by a live band and you could even jam with the band and sing to your hearts content. The owners Tony and Tess are doing a great job catering to the filipinos there in Arizona. Too bad I missed the line dancing, that would have been fun! Oh, did I mention that they have a good selection of filipino pastries and bread? Wish I could come back there soon and try their ube cheese cake, it looks yummy!",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place after seeing its YELP ratings.  Being married to a Filipina we are always watching for good Filipino restaurants.  After visiting here we're still looking for one.  But their bakery is awesome!  So this review is mixed.  Pancit and rice came standard with the entree. Portions are filipino size (that is, similar to restaurants in the Philippines - a bit small), but not outrageous.  The food was very average.  The caldereta tasted like American beef stew, and it shouldn't have.  It wasn't bad, but if you know caldereta you know this was much too bland.  The sinigang was OK, as was the fresh lumpia (sariwa), and pinakbet.  Nothing special, though.  The staff made up for it a bit, being very nice and friendly.  The sago gulaman also was good.  So the restaurant is 2 stars.  Better than Jeepney Bistro, but that's not a very high bar to clear.  The bakery is a solid 4 stars.  They have cannoli (Italian), puto, leche flan, pan de sal, pan de leche, fruit tarts, mamon, bibinka, and more.  We tried their pan de sal and pan de leche, both were excellent.  Their \"chocolate mousse tower\" was fine.  The puto was very good.  We bought several more items that we haven't tried yet (like the ube cheese roll).  But so far the bakery items have NOT disappointed!!  I can't see driving all this way for their food (we live in Gilbert, this is almost in Glendale), but I can see doing it for the bakery.  As good or better than Golidlocks (the standard for most Filipino baked items).",

Would be interested to see what was offered and was going to ask about it but forgot to ask as I was leaving. I'll have to check it out next time.",

    "text": "Situated at the corner of 35th Avenue and Thunderbird next to a pawn shop, this place is definitely a hole in the wall kind of place. The owner of this restaurant was orignally a renowned pastry chef, and now she has come into her own and expanded into a full blown restaurant and pastry shop. Her family is so friendly every time I visit and you can tell she loves to watch people enjoy her homecooked style Filipino foods.  Desserts:      Halo Halo (mix-mix) dessert is amazing here! The flan is so perfect within this dessert too!      Ube Cheese Rolls - These are made with Ube (a purplish taro plant type) mixed with a cream cheese type filling. Oh my frickin' gosh, I love this to pieces! The thin flakiness of the dough blends perfectly with the cheese and ube filling!  Entrees:     Adobo chicken - order a large size of this and you won't be disappointed - even those afraid to try new flavors. This will be a favorite.    Calderetta - she usually cooks this dish with beef and potatoes - almost like a slow cooked stew that can be poured over white rice    Pancit Bihon - My favoirte type of pancit. It's the thin noodle style with veggies and usually a meat like chicken or pork or both    Pancit Malabon - My dad's favorite type. It has thicker noodles and comes with mini shrimp and hard boiled eggs. My 2nd favorite type of pancit.    Kare Kare - Here it's made with beef or pork. My mom used to make this dish when I was growing up with Oxtail. It's a type of peanut butter stew with meat, eggplant and green beans. I know it sounds strange, but believe me, if you're on the adventurous side, you can learn to love this dish too.     Fried chicken - This is delicious fried chicken! I thought it'd be more similar to that type of fried chicken you get at Chinese restaurants that's cut up into small pieces and looks dark brown almost reddish, but it turns out this is good 'ol Alabama style fried chicken. I didn't expect to find this on the menu at all which was funny, but I think it'd taste awesome for breakfast with some waffles!  That about sums up my favorites at this place! And believe it or not, they actually have online ordering, so you don't have to worry about pronouncing anything over the phone if you're ordering to-go orders! Better yet, sit down and eat food while ordering food to go!",

Now for the food. The lumping Shanghai is good. Good balance of the pork filling and the crispy wrapper. And the do give you a size big enough for two to share an appetizer. Of course, I ate it all. Now I wasn't super hungry, but I saw the Sisig pork, one of my favorites. When it came out, I also got a generous scoop of rice and pancit. A+ the sisig itself was good, probably could have been served on a sizzling platter to reduce some of the oil, but I did enjoy the taste. Overall, this place is an excellent find. When I'm in Phoenix again, I'll have to stop in and try something else. This could be a regular thing. Sarap!",

We ordered the fried chicken, which was regular fried chicken.  It was only two or three pieces.  They were fine.  We also oredered the pancit with the big noodles and shrimp on the top.  The shrimp had a weird taste.  I didn't love the noodles either.  I enjoyed the pork belly.  It was crispy and came with a nice gravy.  I would order it again.  My son ordered the flan and really liked it.",

There's a ton of sweet stuff to look for here, they have a small part of the restaurant that shows all the great pinoy sweets. I suggest taking anything with taro, or ube. They are so good.

I tried the Pancit Melabon, which is a dish consisting of thick yellow egg noodles mixed with pork rinds (I had them hold the pork rinds, since I don't eat pork) and topped with shrimp and boiled eggs. It was served with puto, a delicious rice cake. The portion was huge and the flavors were wonderful. It was served with a plate of white rice and a generous portion of ramen-like noodles (I'm not sure what they are called). The price for this dish was only $7.99 and it was a huge portion.   My friends tried the binagoongang fish (milk fish) and barbequed pork and they both raved about their meals.  We were all tempted by the wonderful bakery display. I tried the butter pecan cookie, which is like a large Mexican wedding cookie (yum!) and my friends had the cannoli and the ube cheese roll, both of which were excellent. Next time I want to try the chocolate mousse tower, which looked rich and delicious.   The restaurant itself is nothing fancy. The food and the friendly service are the highlights, although I hear they have entertainment and karaoke on Friday nights.",

    "text": "I was craving some Filipino food without having to make it myself. I assumed that there wouldn't be many Filipino places near me; but a two-second search through Yelp proved me wrong.   I ordered a variety of stuff to get a general feel of what this place has to offer (no, I didn't eat it all---I have lots of leftovers to enjoy later). I ordered the chicken adobo, pancit palabok, and 3 types rolls--guava with cheese, ube, and plain cheese fillings.  I agree that the food has a home-cooked feel, so do not expect some fancy or gastro-pub meal. The adobo tasted great, just like how my mom makes it. There were sides of pancit and rice; both tasted fresh. I wasn't particularly fond of the pancit palabok; there was too much egg in it, but I'm real picky when it comes to preparing the dish.  I ate a third of the roll with the guava and cheese filling. It was delicious! There is a sweet cheese and guava jelly that melts together well with the flaky crust. I imagine if I had this when it was freshly baked or even heated up, I would have enjoyed it more. I have yet to try the other two, but I think I will like them too.   The two people who took my order and packaged everything up were really nice. Then there was the one remark 99.9% Filipinos say to me, \"But you're so tall!\" One of them told me to come to karaoke on Fridays to make friends; haha, cute. The restaurant looks like a Filipino home that happens to have a couple of bakery displays. So again, nothing fancy but I'm OK with that.",

A place that is reminiscent of your mom's- the smells coming from the kitchen, the sound of a language from a faraway land, and visual details like the place settings at the tables and Asian decor all around. The pinakbet (pronounced pe-nuk-bet) only a Filipino/a can truly appreciate- the salty essence of shrimp bagoong (pronounced ba-gu-ong) flavoring a stew of tender calabasa (squash), ampalaya (bittermelon), sitaw (Chinese string beans), and talong (Chinese eggplant), eaten with rice. To make it truly Filipino, you would eat it with your hands (kamayan). The best part of the restaurant is meeting other Filipin@s- like Professor Jerry who plays music on Sundays and teaches Filipino martial arts.",

The person who greeted me was a rude looking MEXICAN guy with a hat on. The only saving grace of this place is the wonderfully sweet waitress Claire.. She does her job well! Never and I repeat never eat at this restaurant!!",

    "text": "Here's what I ordered:  1) Kare Kare Plate + flavor was good + portions were a good size - pork meat was used rather than ox tail (kare kare is made with ox tail and not pork) +/- the plate came with pancit (I may be filipino but I don't like pancit period)  2) Dinuguan - it was a bit salty + good but just a lit to salty  3) Halo - Halo - no Ube ice cream (it's not the same without Ube ice cream) - more shaved ice than the toppings (I had to dig deep in order to get to the stuff on the bottom  The employees are very friendly and helpful. Customer service is top notch.  The baked good look so delicious--I wanted to purchase all of them. NOTE: they bake all their goods in the restaurant and DONT have it delivered like other filipino restaurants.  I'll give this restaurant 4 stars.",

All were well priced and very good. The sisig was not as good as the one I used to have as a little kid in pampanga but it was pretty darn good! Definitely worth coming back again!",

    "text": "Today made our way to Casa Filipina Bakeshop and Restaurant.   It's located in a strip mall down the road from ASU. It's a hidden gem for sure, no fancy signs telling you I am here, a diamond in the rough.  When you enter you immediately see assortments of desserts, what caught my eye is the Ube mousse torte (purple yam cake) one can drool with all the yummy desserts offered.  We were greeted and were taken to our table, the place is not big probably around 8-10 tables. Looking through the menu they offer a lot of filipino classic dishes like adobo, kaldereta, pork/chicken BBQ, sinigang, chicken inasal, kare kare and many more. Plus for desserts besides the assortment of pastries they have Halo Halo!  So I ordered the kare kare and my husband and mother in law ordered the chicken adobo. This is the first time my mother in law is eating filipino food ( unfortunately I do not cook filipino food.. Wish I did)  When our food came they give you white rice and a side of pancit (filipino noodles) and portions of the viande good for 2 people. We all had our own order and we all finished it ourselves ( it was really good). My mother in law enjoyed the chicken adobo (I was so glad.. ) and so did my husband. The Kare kare was great big pieces of beef so tender and the sauce (peanut) was so yummy I had to get another order of rice! Lol   I think the lady that approached us was the owner, she was so welcoming and nice! She also said that on Friday nights they have karaoke ( Filipinos loves karaoke who doesn't right?!?).  For dessert, I just ordered sansrival/sylvanas and the Ube mousse torte to go as we were stuffed. ( ate the dessert and it was delicious!)  I really enjoyed eating here, the food, service and desserts were incredible definitely would visit here again when in the Phoenix area.   If you have never had filipino food and want to try, come to Casa Filipina Bakeshop and Restaurant you will not be disappointed.  *They have the description of the food in English so you know what you are ordering.",
