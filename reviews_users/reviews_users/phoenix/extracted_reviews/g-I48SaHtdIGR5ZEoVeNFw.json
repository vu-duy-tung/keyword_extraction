We were told bring own food is not allowed even for baby, needless to say, we were upset and that would be our last time visiting there.  This restaurant is the most kid unfriendly restaurant.",

    "text": "Honestly, I don't know how this place gets such good reviews.  It must be the service.  I got take out on this visit so I will assume I missed out on amazing, courteous and attentive service.  Yadda, yadda.  I ordered two easy maki (the spicy tuna and the shrimp tempura roll), some miso soup, edamame, fried rice and chicken teriyaki for two and a half people to eat.  Normally I would order some ahi sashimi or some specialty rolls, but when trying a new sushi place I like to tiptoe into the waters.  SPICY TUNA ROLL:  Presentation? C.  It was ugly.  It looked like the roll had puked up some tuna on top of it.   Taste?  Meh.  It was a little fishy and not AT ALL spicy.  SHRIMP TEMPURA ROLL:  Presentation? B.  Standard.   Taste? Slightly less flavorful than even the bland chains (RA, etc.).  CHICKEN TERIYAKI BOWL:  Presentation? D.  It looked inedible.  There was barely any sauce on the chicken.  It was color-less.  It had a few potatoes and a few pieces of steamed broccoli atop a bowl of white rice.   Taste?  My friend ate it, so I can't comment on taste.  However, his comments ranged from \"Wow, this has NO flavor\" to \"Maybe the cook was off today and they had the busboy making the food.\"  FRIED RICE & EDAMAME: Fried rice was eaten by a three year old who loves rice.  She only picked out the veggies and left the rice.  Hmm.  Edamame was ice-cold (as in, did they just take this out of the freezer and not even fully defrost it?).  I give this place two stars only because it was cheap and the miso soup didn't suck (seems impossible to screw up miso soup, but it happens).  Oh, yeah, and the person who took my order seemed friendly.  Needless to say, it doesn't matter how close Sushi Ken is to my abode.  I will NOT be dining here or ordering food from here again.",

And, if you don't want to take my word for it, then take the entire Phoenix Japanese population.  They ALL eat here!  If its just the food you care about, this is the place.  If you are seeking a warm, inviting atmosphere with great service then this is clearly not the spot.  One last thing... while my review of Sushi Ken's food is terrific, Sushi Ken himself is unfriendly, never smiles, has less than zero personality, ignores children (while making sushi at the bar), and flat out does NOT like to be asked questions nor be spoken to.  Weird!",

Love it because it is by far the best sushi place I have been, all things considered. Hate it because after it, all other sushi places I ahve been seem subpar. Ridiciliously good and fresh sushi and ridiciliously low prices. Now that I am in LA I have paid 2-3 times the money is some of the \"best\" sushi places here to eat worse sushi.  To everyone that wrote negative reviews about the noodles/service e.t.c. Guys you come to this place for only one reason: GREAT SUSHI. Please go for your noodles, teriyaki etc somepleace else. Agree with the reviewer before me, it is a same this place has not 5 stars in yelp, shows some people can never be satisfied with anything.",

The tempura shrimp and veggies were excellent and I also had the pork ramen bowl and spicy tuna roll.  The sauce served with the sushi was great and did not have any complaints.  The prices for the items I ordered was very reasonable and the dinner total was very fair.  The service was excellent and the wait staff was very accommodating.  The menu is huge and there are plenty of dishes to choose from.  Don't expect the decor to be anything exciting...it's dressed as a typical Chinatown restaurant, which is by no means a bad thing.  I highly recommend giving this place a try, I'll for sure be going again.",

Ya, that wasn't really a sentence, but you get the idea. I have gone all around town and tried out sushi but no one matches their big fresh cuts here at sushi ken. And I'm talking real sushi here people, not just california / mexican rolls. Raw Fish. The prices are not cheap but good sushi is never cheap (conveyor belts etc is NOT good sushi). Any True sushi  fan I have brought he has agreed, and begged me to take them back.  Their Ramen is also outstanding. We've been to several ramen only joints here in the valley but none do it as well as sushi ken.",

Most of the meals includes miso soup and salad or soybeans.  The kiddie meals are a great deal too.

My wife and I come here regularly for date nights.  Their happy hour selections include a number of rolls and drinks.  Due to the intimate nature of the restaurant,  they seat about 20 tables so maybe 50 people total.  My advice is to not come during dinner rush (6p-8p) because this place gets packed and can easily be an hour or more wait but you can also jump into an open seat at the sushi bar and avoid waiting for a table.",

I was really looking forward to this meal. Having to drive 30min for the highly-recommended Sushi Ken? It'd be worth it, right? I had even skipped lunch in the hopes to be famished and love every bite of the dinner even more than normal.  :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( :( It was the worst Japanese food I've ever had.  I had the Beef Curry and Tonkatsu Ramen combination with a salad. The salad was colorless and wilted, and the dressing (I love Japanese dressing), was overly vinegar-tasting. The Beef Curry was ok, but I make better Japanese Curry at home using the curry cubes in the boxes sold at supermarkets.   The Tonkatsu Ramen....should not have been called such. The ramen tasted worst than instant ramen! It was mushy! There was no taste in the broth of marrow-y goodness. It was a salty, lifeless broth with shriveled bamboo shoots, too much wakame, and one measly thin slice of charsiu. I had about 4 bites and left the rest to die. I didn't even take it home to try to remedy it.  My husband had the Tempura Bowl and Shoyu Ramen combination with an Edamame side.The edamame was the grayest-green shade I'd ever seen. Frozen edamame from the supermarket looked better than that! His tempura bowl was bizarre...gone was the flaky, crunchy Panko breading. What was brought out was a glazy, weirdly crusted abomination that was overly sweet. I would like to dip my tempura myself, thank you very much. His Shoyu Ramen was terribly salty. My husband even likes things very salty, and he couldn't drink it. He also left 90% of his bowl untouched.   The only thing they didn't mess up was their California Roll, which is pretty impossible to mess up so thank goodness for that.   And the service? Terrible. Absolutely terrible. We were a table of 9, and they could have cared less. The 15% was already included in the bill, so maybe that's why they didn't even bother to try to be nice to us. The ladies were so mean! It looked like they just hated everyone they were serving! And usually Japanese waiters are SOOOOO nice. I know, cause I used to wait tables alongside co-workers who had just immigrated from Japan.  Funny thing is, the rest of the table really enjoyed their food. (Update: One of them messaged me after reading this review to tell me she actually didn't like the food...lol I guess my husband and I were not the only ones that didn't enjoy it) Nobody enjoyed the service though, I can assure you of that lol.",

    "text": "I could only imagine how bad the service in a restaurant could be, until I visited Sushi Ken with my family on 8/12/2012 for lunch.   The waitresses who served our table, (I really wish I knew her name, she is the taller one, with *less* Japanese accent),  she had provided the worst service I have ever seen, it was as if she did everything in the purpose of offending customers.  (1) Our party has 6 adult and 3 kids occupying 3 tables putting together, when she came over to take order, I was sitting at the other side of tables and I told her \"I am ready to order\", she said \"That's what I am here for.\" and just stood still there, I had to raise my voice to finish ordering for everyone.  I mean, I was the one who's talking and couldn't she just move a few steps toward me ?  (2) We ordered some sushi rolls and 5 complete meals, she told us we will get 5 appetizers and asked if we want salad or Edamame, we said 3 salad's and 2 Edamame's, and they were served as ordered, no problem here.  Later on she brought over 4 bowls of miso soup.  I think it is quite normal for anyone to expect 5, right ?  So I asked her \"Shouldn't it be five?\"  Guess what?  SHE ASKED ME: \"WHY?\"    Oh my god, she asked me back \"WHY\" and then we went totally silence after that.  It took me about 10 seconds to guess and said \"is it because one of our meals only comes with appetizer, but not soup ?\",  then she said \"uh -ah\" and walked away.  Are you serious ??  (3) After we had our fried rice and curry beef plates delivered, we looked around on our tables for spoon and not finding any, I waved her over and said that we need spoons for eating THIS fried rice and THAT curry rice.  I even pointed at these two plates because I was already afraid of mis-communication.  Then she brought over \"one\" spoon!!  1, o-n-e, single, uno !!  I told her again that we needed two, she stared at me as if I should have told her exactly how many I wanted.  Hello? I told you we need it FOR THE FRIED RICE AND THE CURRY RICE !!  IT IS YOUR PROBLEM serving plates that need spoons to work on, and not bring spoons with them, not my problem.  (4) After that moment I think her attitude turned from \"not friendly\" to \"rude\", when she brought over my noodle, SHE THREW THE BOWL WITH NOODLE SOUP TO MY HANDS, can you believe that !?  She delivered the noodle to my hands, not my table !!  What if I did not catch it ??  She definitely had gone over my edge at that time, if I were not with my parents and kids, I would have exploded right away, it was my family that prevented a confrontation from happening right there.   (5) The food is plain, actually after all of the above happening, I didn't care about the foods anymore even they were 5-star quality.    After the kids were fed, I waved her a couple times for check and I don't know if she overlooked me deliberately or she really didn't see me, after about 5 minutes I walked over to the cashier's stand and asked her \"Can we have the check, please?\".  YES I SWEAR TO GOD THAT I STILL USED THE WORD 'PLEASE' TO HER.     She did not bother to raise her head or even speak up, she just keep doing what she is doing, and nod her head.   At that time I immediately told myself two things:  (1) I am not stepping into this restaurant ever again in my life, and  (2) I will do whatever it takes to let the store manager know what happened today, or let the store owner (if she happens to be the manager).  Having this kind of employee is definitely hurting the business !  *** To that waitress *** . If you do not like providing service, then don't do this job.  I am not expecting you to show any passion, if this is just a source-of-income for you; But you need to have some basic manner and  respect if you put 18% gratuity on my bill.  If I wasn't forced to pay that, you were not getting ANY tip from me, because you do not deserve it.",

Then, a few of the more 'conservative' rolls.  I can't say they were horrible but I also can't say they were good.  I even ordered a side of chicken fried rice and found it not good, either.

A tip to get seated faster: look at what's open. If you request to be seated at the bar but the bar is full, you're going to wait a while. We ordered twice and got out in under an hour, so I think it wasn't bad for how packed they were (and on a Wednesday night!). Besides, it's worth the wait.",

We had tuna tataki, langostino roll, Philadelphia Roll (in honor of the Phillies advancing to the NLCS), spicy tuna roll some gyoza and miso.  Our intent was to have enough to bring home, and we certainly did.  The tuna tataki was the star of the show - I would recommend that anyone who has not been to Sushi Ken should give it a try just for the tataki.  It was excellent - and only $6.95 for a very generous portion.  I was stunned.  The langostino roll was spicy and delicious for and the Philadelphia roll was pretty standard - which is not a criticism, Philly rolls are what they are.  The spicy tuna roll was over the top with spicy tuna mounded on top of a normal spicy tuna roll.  Very impressive for the price and in comparison to other places.  This place is not fancy, but I dont care - I will be coming here to eat, and I will be coming often.  I am so happy that it is in my neighborhood.",

The main difference is that they also serve various types of sushi.  It is quite good for the amount of money.  The free california sushi that comes with your entree is not all that great but hey, they don't charge extra for it so what do you expect. Fish quality is acceptable but not extraordinary.  If you really want top quality sashimi you can try sushi hiro or sushi on shea in Scottsdale but expect to pay a lot more for the same dishes.. Sushi Ken is the type of restaurant that I can go every day without going bankrupt.. When I feel like spending more for something more unque I would visit Sushi Hiro..",

I was dumbfounded to see how my $10 even meal became $12.90 on the receipt. They must really love patting themselves on the back because AZ sales tax is only 5.6% which makes this a 25% tip!  Onto the food. I've been to this place twice. First time I ordered a cha shu ramen. The noodles and the char siu  tasted very authentic but the broth was remarkably plain. It tasted like something I'd improvise at home if I only had leftover noodles. It also didn't include extra ingredients you'd expect like a soft-boiled egg.  Second time I ordered a korokke curry. This dish really puzzled me, the curry was as thin and almost as flavorless as water, the korokke was hard and tasted like they added no salt to the potatoes at all, and the rice was overcooked. Japanese rice is characteristically soft as it is but it tasted like they cooked it a good half an hour longer than they should have.  The food is really bizarre. I can tell from the people speaking Japanese and the ingredients that this is supposed to be an authentic Japanese restaurant, but it's almost like they've never been taught how to cook it properly. If it was just for the food and service I'd give this place a 3 star, but the tip scamming really miffs me. I don't expect to ever come back here again.",

My first visit actually was a less-than-stellar experience. I ordered a softshell crab roll and a spicy salmon roll, and the cucumbers they used in the rolls were extremely bitter! Totally threw off the taste of the roll! (Although that was probably a fluke because the next time I came the cucumbers were fine) All my other friends ordered ramen or udon lunch sets, and theirs seemed fine so no complaints there.  But then I learned from a friend in the know that what you actually need to do if you want sushi is to order their $5 special rolls. Way cheaper, and still a good selection! Personal favorites: Baked Alaska and White Tuna. At only $5 each, they are a filling and inexpensive option if you're feeling like sushi!",

The Dynamite Don looked like it always did but this time, there was VERY little rice on the bottom. It tasted more like I was drinking mayo sauce with some seafood...

I also highly highly recommend their sashimi platter- the fish melts in your mouth and is so fresh! They don't skimp on their sashimi slices either...expect 1 1/2 inch thick slices! And the bonus is that the sushi chefs are from Japan and the owner are as well! True and delicious Japanese cuisine!

And if you HAVE eaten here and aren't digging it *coughteriyakichickenwtfcough*, there's a splendid Neo Tokyo up the road that may be more suited to your \"tastes\" (or lack thereof).",

They also have some killer lunch specials and the staff have exotic eyes (one with blue eyes and one with a lazy). The tempura was also good- not oily at all and very fresh. Try their bento box lunches. Lots of food- most of it under $9 with edamame and miso.  Decor is gross but honestly come here for the sushi. It's really good for the price!

The salmon sashimi was excellent, but the usually reliable yellowtail - not so much. We had a couple of spicy rolls, which were pretty bland, not spicy in the least.  The service, however, was terrible. Ten minutes standing at the \"hostess\" desk before we were acknowledged. Ended up sitting at the sushi bar, which is usually pretty quick, but not this time. Fifteen minutes before a server showed up, then 45 minutes for a basic sushi meal. Got tired of waiting for the check, finally had to go to the rear of the reastaurant to hunt our \"tunnel vision\" server down.  On the plus side, the prices are very reasonable, but I don't think we will be going back",

Great prices - between $3.50 - $5.50 for sushi - and the fish is double the amount of rice. Rolls run between $5 - $9.50 and they have a great selection.  Like others have mentioned, it's not a fancy place - fine by me! It's very authenticate. Sunday nights it's pretty slow so you get fabulous service - and they're always fast to deliver the food. Tried the sweet and spicy roll for the first time tonight and loved it! The only reason i don't give it 5 stars is b/c i've been there when it's busy and the servers can't keep up.",

    "text": "Obivously here in Phoenix, we can't get top grade sushi, so this place is okay. (I usually do not order sushi but other dishes)  The quality of the food is bearable but the service you get, not so. It seems from other reviews this place does this quite often to its customers but my girlfriends I went for a brief lunch on Friday and asked to have our bill split.  When the old Japanese waitress heard that, she got really irritated and said \"we'll add tip to your bill\".  WHAT?? for splitting a check you have to add on the gratuity?  Since there were four of us, we thought, okay whatever.  When it was time for us to order, some of us were bit hesitant trying to decide and the waitress got all frustrated and showed it on her face like she didn't want to be there. OMG, it wasn't like the place was crowded with customers, she had only two other tables and she was working with another waitress.  And after we ordered, she NEVER CAME BACK to our table!!!!  When the food came that was the only time she came back to give us our food, and never came back to check on our drinks or to see if we needed anything.  Fortunately the other young waitress came and tried to tend to our table which was nice of her.  Finally the bill came and she wrote everything down on one sheet and total was like around $59.xx for four of us, and she added 11.80 for tip.  So I asked her if it was cutomary for them to add 20% gratuity.  Then she rolls her eyes and goes \"it's 18%, not 20%\"  What?  I may not be a math genius but that is about 20% not 18% that she claimed.  My girlfriends and I did not want to make a big deal out of 2% difference so we left it at that.  But to be honest, I did not want to leave any tip for her.  I couldn't believe they tagged on gratuitiy simply because we asked to have our bill split.  This was the second visit we wished we had our lunch somewhere else.  I guess we're not coming back here anymore.",

When we arrived, the dinner rush hadn't begun. We ordered an appetizer, and we each ordered a meal. They brought out the hot dinner food first. When we were almost done, the appetizer finally arrived and so did the two orders of sashimi that were the dinner order of two members, so we had to wait for them to finish their food before ordering dessert. When the last two people finished their meals, we waited five to ten minutes before we decided to go up and ask to order dessert, which is when our waiter decided to come to the table and ask us if we wanted anything else for dessert. When we were finished with our food, we went up to ask for the check. When we finally received the check, they already added on a gratuity of 20% for a party of five. When we went to ask them about this, they said they only put an 18% tip and started arguing about it. The slower food service usually happens, and we usually go up to ask them for dessert and the check because the waiters stop coming to check on us, but after this debacle with the added gratuity,  I will personally never go to this restaurant again, and I would not recommend it especially if you go with your families.",

Tempura was oily and soggy (temperature issue when fried), sashiime was 3 piece of lumpy fish that I didn't even know it was sashime. Btw, I just read someone's review about their sashime being FROZEN, i had the opposite problem, mine was warm. What kind of sashime is served warm?!

Quite plain and dark indeed. Then I could only see waitresses and chefs who are NOT Japanese, and I was kind of wondering if I had gone to the wrong place. Ok, when we sat down, two people came to serve us and we finally see one Japanese woman, then I felt a bit relieved that I got to the right place.  I ordered a korokke curry coz I missed the taste of korokke so much, not a lot of Japanese restaurants here have this on the menu, so I was quite looking forward to it :)  BUT! When I tried the miso soup, my expectations started to fade...it's really salty! It felt like a lot of tap water mixing some powder...(Plus the hot tea was salty too! Should be made with tap water instead of drinking water...The waitress also gave us wrong orders of salad/edamame too, but that's not a big deal...)  Then my korokke curry finally came, and I could see the curry sauce was as thin as juice flowing on my plate (my friend ordering katsu curry also had the same kind of thin sauce)...The sauce was not sweet curry nor spicy curry, but plain curry.  The korokke was not my favorite either, the crust was partly burnt in black, too hard and too thick, unlike the golden thin crispy but not oily crust I expected. The potato inside was tasteless. :(  The rice wasn't that bad and I did completed my plate but I'm really not crazy about it. My hubby also said his Katsu Don wasn't very good.   The only thing that's good was we sat in a nice little quiet corner of the restaurant and had a good time chatting for a few hours without interruption. Anyways, I think we'll try some other Japanese restaurants next time. :)",

The soup base was good, but the meat was not as good and I wish there was more noddles. And yet again, a large portion of food for a good price. We also got the Melon Cream Soda, so we made it out of the restaurant for $25 total.  Overall, the best ramen I've had in the city, minus the meat, and all for a good price. I didn't try the sushi again for fear of not being happy again. If you come hear, stick to the Japanese food, not the sushi (regardless of the vast selection).",

I like others also experience horrible service, and given them multiple chances.  I totally understand bad service when you are trying to do things quick and efficiently, and the place is packed.  Maybe I'm just use to cultures where they don't value service, but value being fast and efficient.  But I draw the line when the place is maybe half full and we have sat down for over 20 to 30 minutes without even asking us what we want to drink.  While I'm a regular user of Yelp.  This has been the first time I've ever posted on Yelp because no place has actually gotten me so angry about them.  Also I've never played the race card before, but I truly believe that the servers there might be racist.",

The service has varied from decent to bad, and yes,  if you ask to split the check they automatically add a couple extra bucks to your bill without telling you. A little deceiving, if you ask me, but the reason I keep going back is because their prices are great and (some of) thier food is pretty good for a Japanese restaurant in Arizona. In my opinion, it's worth trying out if you don't walk in with high expectations for food and service.",

Sushi Ken is a bright, cheery place with good service and great food.    They are creative with rolls - they managed to have a few that I had never tried before (Crazy Roll is a version of a shrimp tempura roll, Crunchy roll is a California roll with tobiko and unagi sauce on top).   More than that, they have some excellent entrees.  The saba was big and delicious.  The konkorre (deep fried mashed potato with meet and onions) was, well, deep fried but good.  The tonkatsu was excellent, and the food in general outperformed my expectations.  Our friends in the area use this place as their go-to Japanese restaurant, and now I can see why.  Tasty and friendly.  I'm a fan.",

    "text": "Trying to find a Sushi place that is open for lunch on Saturday was tough but we did find Sushi Ken.   We were served complimentary miso soup and edamame.   Their sushi picture menu had a lot going on so it was hard to decide, we ended up getting an avocado roll, a vegetable roll, a crunchy roll and a tempura fried California roll.   I wasn't really paying attention to the sushi being made because I was busy eating my soup and edamame.   All our rolls looked good but sadly, not tasting all that great.  The seaweed was so chewy, the Crunchy Roll is advertised as using snow crab but it was obviously mixed with Krab as well, not to mention what tasted to me like a gallon of Miracle Whip, it was soooooo gross!!  The Avocado roll was the best one despite the chewy seaweed, the deep fried roll was just gross too, definitely made with a roll that was quite possibly rolled days ago and the vegetable roll was just OK,  it had a strange mix of veggies inside, I don't even know what they were.   Now another couple walk in and sit near us at the sushi bar and I was able to see the sushi being made since I was done eating.   Sure enough, I see the chef grab pre-made rolls from across the counter and top it with fish for a rainbow roll. GROSS!   There is no reason why these rolls could not be made fresh to order.   Now on to an even bigger surprise, you know how they usually grab a piece of seaweed and a hand full or rice and begin to work it onto the seaweed........  I saw the chef grab a piece of seaweed and take it down behind counter for literally 1/4 of a second and come back up with it covered with the pressed rice WTF!!!   Their rice and seaweed it also pre-made not wonder it was so damn chewy!   I would rather wait and wait for freshly made sushi any day than be served soggy chewy old  pre-made Crap!   Seriously I'll never go here again!!",

My advice is come for lunch or early dinner and you won't be disappointed.  My favorites are the ramen, the gyu don and the chunky spicy sushi rolls.  Frankly they did have a bit of an issue with service in the past.  To their credit they've hired new servers and more servers and it isn't an issue any more.  Bottom Line: Best sushi and ramen in the valley",

My husband is Japanese, & we've picked apart every sushi restaurant in the East Valley(not on Yelp, though). I should make a list.  This is where we eat sushi. We live @ 40 minutes away & drive in for a meal.(Though with the price of gas...)  In the price:freshness ratio of good sushi, Sushi Ken has it made.  It's like a real Japanese family restaurant. Giant menus with a little of everything on it. Want sushi? Got it! Kids only eat noodles? Got it! Sister-in-law doesn't eat fish? Got it! Just like home, there's something for everyone.   In addition, the sushi is actually good, fresh & plentiful. Plus, if you can read Japanese there's little signs posted around with specialties like negitoro donburi, my favorite.  Here's a little story; We've been married almost 33 years. I'm ashamed to say that until my last trip to Japan in 2004 I didn't like sushi. At the great Tsukigi Fish Market, I ate my first negitoro donburi & fell in love. I even had it as my last meal at the airport before we left Japan, and my husband has taught himself to make it for me at home.(good guy!) It was life changing!  So go to Sushi Ken, and enjoy! But let's just keep it between us so there's still some negitoro for me!",

    "text": "I came to Sushi Ken on the recommendation of a friend of a friend who spoke highly of them.  First off when pulling up at night we couldn't even tell for sure they were open until we saw the small open sign lighting up as it was fairly dim inside.  Once inside we were seated and started going over the menus. As with many sushi places there is the cooked food menu with all kinds of combo options, the sushi menu and here they also had a sushi combo menu. The sushi combo menu is technically labeled \"lunch specials\" but sunday-Thursday it's all day.  I ordered a combo of a spicy tuna roll and a spicy yellowtail roll that included miso soup and your choice of edamame or salad for $10. I also ordered the white tuna tataki roll ($5). I went with salad and the waiter repeated that back to me and then 2 minutes later brought edamame and then kinda got a little taken aback when I said I had ordered the salad. He did take the edamame back and bring a salad quickly though. My girlfriend got the cali roll and a dynamite cali.  The sushi was pretty tasty although I think the spicy tuna and yellowtail were a bit undersized. I did like the yellowtail was big chunks of yellowtail, which I am guessing is what their chunky spicy tuna is like. The spicy tuna was fine but lacked any spice. The cali dynamite was ok but they used too much mayo on it, i did like the variety of different seafood on top but some of the fish chunks were over cooked. The standout was the white tuna tataki which was a pretty solid sized roll and was very tasty. If I come back it's probably to order 2 of these.  One other weird thing of note here was that the water tasted a bit chemically to both my girlfriend and I. It was like some residual cleaner was still in the glass as it had a chemical citrus taste.  I will say their prices are pretty reasonable for the most part although some combos seemed high. I can't argue that I got 3 rolls, miso, and a salad for $15.  On the strength of the tataki roll and the fact the fish quality seemed fine they get 3 stars from me falling right in my range of: I wouldn't be against stopping if I am nearby but unlikely to make it a destination. So if you are in the area it's worth checking out.",

The edamame appetizer was very fresh, so it tasted great even when unsalted. Sashimi was delicious as well, and it was plated nicely.  On my first trip here, the chicken itself of the chicken teriyaki was brined to be overly salty and overpowering with the sauce added. Nevertheless, I returned, and this time the staff was able to bring me non-brined chicken with teriyaki sauce on the side so I could customize the saltiness -- and thus my meal ended up perfect.   Overall, super accommodating staff, quick service, and delicious food. KEN not wait to come again!!",

Pricing is reasonable in most cases (Not sure why their Boat No. 3 is now $74 though) and arguably one of the best Japanese restaurants in Phoenix that serves good varieties of authentic Japanese food.  They still have some American food just in case you are a \"California-roll\" type of diner.  I love wasabi octopus and other \"hard to find\" Japanese food that probably only exist in this restaurant within 100 mile radius.  Their sashimi aren't the best as the cuts are very average.  I do notice that their sashimi quality starts to head south recently, so I will only vouch for other Japanese food here and not the sashimi.  Ps.  They serve all 3 major Japanese beer brands for those who cares.",

At least it's not as bad as the Japanese-Mexican fusion place I went to earlier this week.  Yikes.  Anyways, met up with the in-laws today to celebrate my sister-in-law's milestone birthday.  I have never been here before so I jumped onto Yelp last night to see what would catch my eye.  Since it's been pretty chilly due to the winter storm, I was leaning towards ramen.  It ended up being a safe choice after seeing and tasting a little bit of what everyone ordered.  I ordered the Miso Butter Ramen with the Deluxe Dragon Roll on the side.  My ramen came with either salad or edamame and three California rolls.  I should have checked the tips on Yelp because I chose the edamame thinking the warm soybeans would help warm me up as we were seated under the only ceiling fan that appeared to be running.  It was cold and old and I ended up sliding it over the Mr. W. who had a very gross salad.  The California rolls are basic so it's nothing to write home about.  The ramen was satisfying.  Although the noodles seem to be the store-bought variety, I enjoyed the flavor of the miso broth immensely.  Paired with the butter that made the soup base creamy and coat my mouth with a wonderfully richness, I was pretty happy --- even with the hard-boiled egg [I was hoping for a soft-boiled egg].  I wish they had corn instead of bamboo shoots in their ramen but that's just all personal preference.  The chashu in my ramen was also nothing special.  The Deluxe Dragon Roll is a fancified dragon roll with the addition of cream cheese and tempura shrimp.  I also got to try some sashimi that didn't seem all too fresh, a cold lovely-dressed jellyfish salad, and other little bites.  Service was a little lacking but it's understandable since it was super busy.  It was a full-restaurant for the two hours we were there.  If I ever stop in again, I think I want to try their udon.",

The prices are ridiculously cheap, food is especially fresh, and their spicy chiraishi is wonderfully delicious.  Starting off with the rolls, my favorites are the Dynamite California Roll ...which melts in your mouth with every bite (full of scallops, salmon). I am a big fan of eel and the Rainbow Roll always satisfies my eel cravings. The Chunky Spicy Yellowtail and Chunky Spicy Tuna Rolls...they are what they say they are...chunky, meaty, and tasty.   What I love most about Sushi Ken is the Spicy Chiraishi. It is literally loaded with all types of sashimi and veggies...for a great price ($12)...I live in NYC and I still miss and crave Sushi Ken.   To all Arizonians, do yourself a favor and take advantage of Sushi Ken, my wife and I sure did during our stay there!",

The interior is absolutely bland, borderline disgusting. It's basically one giant room filled with dim lighting, a dirty ceiling, and an awkward looking bar/kitchen area. I've never heard any atmospheric music being played, the carpet is ugly, the furniture is boring and dark, and there is no privacy offered by the interior design. It feels like you're out in the open for everyone to watch, yet I can never get the waiters attention which brings me to my next point.  2. The service SUCKS! If anyone that works here is reading this, please note that your service is terrible and try to fix it! No one ever greets you when you walk in, so you are left to stand awkwardly at the front of the restaurant until you're lucky enough for a waiter to notice you. The waiters are never friendly, never smile, and never there when you need. If this restaurant just improved their service, I would give them 5 stars.",

My kids had the kids meals (chicken katsu & chicken teriyaki) and they mowed through it. They were even more delighted to get a huge scoop of ice cream at the end (my third child wished she didn't order an adult meal). The servers were great. We were feeling adventurous, so we ordered something I can't remember the name of, but it was a delicious piece of roasted hamachi head. Loved it.

The nigiri sushi is gigantic and will definitely fill you up fast but the fish is often wet from rushed thawing.  Again, for the price I can't complain.  I CAN however tell you that this service is pretty much the worst in the valley.  I'm not sure if these are just innately terrible servers or they could care less about you because they  have plenty of business that they don't need to please anyone.  The service is extremely slow, very disorganized, uncoordinated and just plain bad. I've been going there for awhile and the service has not gotten better and in fact it's gotten worse.   There are too many places in the east valley for good sushi to have to come here and beg to get your food . Update:  I went back recently and found it to be refreshingly nice to be left alone.  The servers are barely there except to take the order and bring you the food. I guess I will return after all if I just want to be left alone.",

Large sashimi cuts that other places would have halved and served you twice.  Unagi was grilled very well here as well as the ubiquitous rolls were done with panache and also very large portions.   The one downside was the tempura and sashimi combinations. The sashimi was great but the tempura was one prawn, one piece of onion and a pepper type.  Not a great selection for tempura.  Another highlight and an exceedingly good value is the chirashi sushi.  Excellent and wide selection of sashimi placed over rice with shreds of grilled seaweed.   Nice selection of beer and hot and cold sake.  Desserts are available though by the time I finished, I was stuffed.",

Second, the waitress told my friend who order a bottle of beer that if he shares his beer with other people she will REPORT him. OMG !!!

The attitude and ambiance of what it means to sit in and dine at a restaurant is far below standard. We arrived at the restaurant with several empty tables. Seating took another 15 minutes. Once seated, we weren't served our drinks until after the tables that arrived after ours got theirs and neither was our order taken until after theirs even though I had notified our waiter that we were ready to order. I do not care if he is the owner's son but to hold such a pretentious attitude at a family owned restaurant is rather un-classy. I've withheld judgement the two previous times that I have visited the restaurant always giving the benefit of the doubt that they were just understaffed or there were too many customers. But, as a diner, I feel that there is just a certain number of bad quality treatment that a customer can take. Needless to say, we walked out after paying for our drinks. Needless to say, I won't be back. I much rather pay a premium and eat at Roka Akor or ShinBay than sit through mediocre sushi and poor service.",

I know it's a stereotype that if the workers speak the language of cuisine's country, and if half the people there look like they're from that country, it must be a good place.  Well, so far that stereotype hasn't been wrong for me, and Sushi Ken meets it.  When I asked about the negitoro (which I haven't had since living in Japan), the waitress asked the chef if they had any toro, in Japanese.  (The answer was \"nai\") :(  Sad times.  But the negihama is a half decent substitute.  The sushi is delicious, and there are all sorts of varieties of rolls.  I'm a sucker for the yami roll, which I really wonder is \"yummy\" in romaji.  Who cares, it makes me pass out with *nom.*  I've also had the tempura ice cream.  It's not the best I've ever had, but it is still purty gosh durn good.

This is the only place that I found that serves real Japanese food that I grew up with. They have lunch special on weekends, which you can order M-Thurs dinner time as well. Lunch special are very inexpensive and lots of good food. They also have $5 sushi rolls special that is great. They have about 6-7 different kinds of rolls, that are $5.  I am not a raw fish person, but I can eat some. I love every dish they serve there. I go there at least twice a month, even though I live about 25 min away. The owner and most of the waitresses are Japanese which is hard to find lately at Japanese restaurants. They are very friendly and lately, there is no wait. It used to be a wait if I go on Fri or Sat night like 2 years ago, but not anymore. There is a flat screen TV with cable, so when I bring my Husband he enjoys ESPN. They are always so nice to my little toddlers. so lunch specials are about $7 to $9 each, and dinner is about $8-$15 or so. Their menu shows all the pictures of dishes, so if you are not familier with Japanese food, it is a good one to go to.",

The server never asked how the food was or offered a substitute when dish after dish was untouched after a bite or 2. When asked for something else, was told that was not an option. The only item comped were the Shrimp Shumai because they were still frozen in the center. Will stick to travelling a few miles rather than a quarter mile for a dinner that consisted of stringy and improperly prepared sashimi maguro, the masago was an odd pale orange color with little flavor, the sweet and spicy roll was more cream cheese than anything spicy or appetizing. The cream crab korokke...resembled a deep fried phlegm ball. No flavor and I imagine had comparable texture. Even the California rolls were underwhelming. The only thing we enjoyed were the gyoza, though we had to request a sauce to accompany the dish, they were cold by the time the server returned with about a tablespoon of brown liquid in a bowl.",

    "text": "I am originally from Japan and this is one of a few Japanese restaurants I love in Phoenix mainly for the following 2 reasons.  1. I can find real authentic Japanese dishes (including sushi) with good quality in a wide variety. 2. All are reasonably priced.  When I say real sushi, I talk about the quality of fish, not about sushi rolls which I don't find in Japan. Well, a few simple sushi rolls like tekka maki (tuna rolls) but definitely not anything like california, spider, rainbow rolls etc. except at fast food style low end restaurants. In Japan I go to both low end ($20-30 per person) and high end ($200-300 or up) sushi restaurants.  Sushi Ken's sushi has quality of a decent sushi restaurant in Japan. It's a really good thing as it seems hard to get fresh fish in Phoenix. First time I had their sashimi lunch set, I was impressed by the quality of the fish. So my guess is they have at least one Japanese real sushi chef who knows fish. In Japan, chefs have licenses and specialized in certain areas (such as sushi, Japanese, ramen, etc.) and are trained for years. (like in the movie \"Jiro Dreams of Sushi\")  As for the cost performance, I recommend their appetizer & noodle combo($12.5). It's really a good deal considering some of the appetizers are not really appetizer size. I had chirashi sushi (assorted sashimi on sushi rice) for appetizer twice and it's quite filling by itself, then it's followed by a big bowl of ramen. I couldn't finish all of my food. This combo menu was not in the menu but on the wall.  I noticed some people complained about the waitresses there. I so far haven't had any problems with their service. I've been there for 3 times. They were friendly and quick. I don't think it's because I'm Japanese as they were nice to others too. Maybe I just haven't met the notorious waitress yet.   I'm so excited about going back to Sushi Ken soon. And I recommend this place to all who love authentic Japanese food.",

When I first saw it I was skeptical and thought that the bowl was just full of rice with a little bit of fish on top. NOPE it's the other way around! Full of fish with a little bit of rice on the bottom. We've had a couple of rolls as well and they have also been delicious. Next time I will be trying their ramen!",

    "text": "OK.  I've read some of the reviews here and I see a lot of complaints about service.  Let me give you the real deal.    Why should you listen to me? I travel to Phoenix a lot for work. I eat a lot of sushi. Go ahead, think of another sushi place around.  OK, have you thought of one?  Well... I've probably eaten there and this place is better.  Why?  Sushi quality is top notch and prices are lower than they should be and slightly lower than the average sushi joint. Now, if you're thinking of a restaurant with a $100 piece of nigiri then no, I haven't been there and it may be better.  I go to normal priced sushi joints.  The only downside to this place is that they don't have fresh wasabi.  What's that?  Fresh wasabi?  Yes, many sushi places won't have it on the menu but will sell you some for a buck or so.  Go fresh.  I'm sorry to anyone who feels I just gave away a sushi secret., myself included.  Maybe I'll delete that part later.   Anyways, after eating here a good 15-20 times, I can confidently state that the service is fine.  Only one time did I have poor service.  The reason that you may have poor service is because this place gets packed and there's a line waiting to get seated and to eat.  The staff is then overworked.  Should they have more staff on hand?  I don't know. I'm not a restaurateur.  Bet you didn't know that word didn't have an 'N' in it  Me neither until now.  Point being, it is what it is.  You don't like it.  Don't eat here when it's packed.  They're also the kind of place that will close early when everyone has left.  You know what? I like that.  Sure it can be inconvenient for you, but they probably have a better quality of life because of it and we can all learn from that.   I only wish this place was closer to my home.  Like 2500 miles closer.",

A few days later we discovered that they had added $2.00 each ($4.00 total) on top of what we tipped. My friend called the restaurant and they claimed that it was because we had paid with two credit cards (split). Not only is this charge ridiculous, but it would have been more appropriate to add it to the pre-tip amount or inform us about the charge when we put two cards down. Increasing the amount AFTER WE LEAVE is simply deceptive. From reading other reviews, it appears that we are not the only ones that have experienced this.  The food is mediocre and, as other reviewers state, the service is poor. I will certainly not be back.",

    "text": "YEAH YEAH IT'S A GREAT PLACE BEST SUSHI IN ARIZONA. Well I guess if the cost of living is low you would settle for CRAP!!!! The only reason I give one star is that I'm hoping you read this before you enter the abyss of flavorless food, the out dated torn furniture, the lack of communication and the unpleasant smell of rotting carcasses of old fish.   I'm not picky, I don't look at yelps and judge, I  give the benefit of doubt that maybe one or two, even three bad yelps could just be normal.   $62.00 later I judged. My family and I went there and of course the first thing that hit us straight in the face is the odor. Odor it was, we were hungry my son wanted Rosatis I said tomorrow for lunch. It really should of been that night. I wanted to give a chance, we were seated and it seemed slow but we were early. The waitress took out order, we waited the soups came out fast and so did the eddis mommy (edamame). Our plates came out one by one as it does in most places of that cuisine. We waited for the waitress to come around but all we got was her back as she took care of the other tables, yes understaffed. Places like this use the phrase KISS Keep It Simple Stupid. That was the service and food. They will do what the order says and nothing more besides give you the check and take your money. I was very disappointed, the chicken teriyaki bento was something so unique with combination and the fake chicken breast they use, just as bad if not worse than a frozen lean cuisine, fried soft potato and a baked cup with some onion and chicken I have no idea WTF it was, but I was hungry. I had to try it thinking I would be surprised with some delightful tastebud exploding extravaganza in my mouth, only to have to eat 10 certs after and a shot of JACK to get rid of the bad tasting odor that followed from the room into my mouth. I really would at that point snorted some wasabi, not only for the flavor but also to keep my mind off of spending that kind of money for nothing. If you are in town drive further and eat at a chain sushi place, they lack the creativity of thinking out of the box but it will be consistent. This review is my opinion, take it or leave it.",

    "text": "I live in Los Angeles and I come out to AZ every other month. I have been to Sushi Ken many times, and every time I have had terrible service. This last visit was the last straw. The girl who was our server approach us with such a poor attitude and a sour look on her face. Needless to say, we tried not to ask her for much. At the beginning of our order, I notified her that I will need to place a to go order toward the end of the meal. She walked by our table many times, while our water glasses were empty, she never once stop to ask us if we needed anything or just fill our water glasses.   I then asked her nicely, that when she had a chance, could we get some more water. She then said, \"don't you need to place an order to go?\" I said \"yes, but when you bring the water, we can do it then\". She walked over, slammed a pitcher of water on the table and then walked away. I proceeded to serve our table the water, then walked over to the register to place my to go order and pay my bill.  I have never in my life stiffed a waitress. However, in this case it was necessary. The waitress followed me out to the parking lot and asked me where I had left the tip.   I told her that expecting a tip for NOT doing your job is not the way it goes. T.I.P. means \"To Insure Promptness\" and since I did the job for her, she did not deserve a tip.  The unfortunate thing, is that the sushi is actually good and affordable. I might suggest take-out for this place.",

The food is fantastic, fresh, presentation is outstanding, the people are friendly and the prices are incredible.  There's also a reason it's packed with people of Asian descent. True, the decor isn't Beverly Hills, but if you're more concerned with quality and value over atmosphere, this is a \"must visit\" locally owned, family friendly, neighborhood place.",

I guess raw fish is usually not served in a medical facility around here, maybe in Japan ;) The salmon tasted fresh and it was an attractive roll, $8 well spent as I wanted to increase her protein intake.  I tasted it and there was plenty of fish in small chunks, good wasabi and pickled ginger slices, rice, etc, an attractive package.  Kudos to the young man behind the counter working with an older man, probably his mentor.  The small staff was friendly and appeared efficient.  I will return to try other menu items.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  This is one of the very few reviews where the restaurant can do so poorly in one area but make up for it in another and still maintain 4 stars.    I'll start with the negative.  On busy weekend nights, service here can be abysmal.  Far too few servers to cover the entire place.  You will wait for everything, from water, to ordering, to getting your food all at the same time.  If you go in expecting this, it's not as bad, but sometimes it really can feel frustrating.  But, on the other hand, there is the value and the quality of the food.  If you order off of one of the white boards at the north end of the restaurant, there's a noodle combination and special combination.  If you order either one of these, the noodle combination in particular, you are getting one of the very best values for Japanese food in town, and anywhere.  You can easily split the combination between two people, or be totally stuff on your own.    The food here runs from average to quite good.  They are no longer my go-to ramen joint, but the ramen here is totally passable, made up for mostly by the broth.  I typically opt for the miso  or spicy miso ramen - I believe this is the best broth option.  The udon is also average, but on a cold night, is satisfying.  I've enjoyed quite a few of their appetizers, which they treat with the minimalist care that one should expect from a Japanese restaurant.  The korroke are lightly breaded with a satisfying crunch.  There is a tako (octopus) salad that is slightly vinegary and delicious.    Their sushi also runs from average to good.  If you go for straight nigiri, don't expect coastal quality.  It is akin to fast casual sushi in Japan, which means good for a quick meal but not mind-blowing.  They actually excel in rolls here, and one of the best is the chunky spicy yellowtail.  Decent kick of spice that doesn't totally mask the yellowtail, and plenty of fish.  For another decent deal - get the chirashi bowl.  There is a mini-chirashi and a create-your-own chirashi.  Both are great values and since you're getting a bowl of sashimi, you're getting some better quality cuts than if you were to order straight nigiri.  So plan for the wait, set aside some time, and accept the service issues, for they are worth it in the end.",

Wow is all I can say, we ordered Sushi, since the place has Sushi in its name \" Sushi Ken\" the rolls we got were all mushy and look horrendous. We ordered two bowls of Ramen: Pork and Won Ton, the waitress only brought us the Won Ton one, thank god for that because honestly a 10 cent ramen packet from the grocery store is much better.  The waitress did take the sushi rolls off our bill but had another waitress come over and say that's how they're suppose to look.  I've had sushi and rolls in many major cities and never ever had mushy, runny, nasty looking stuff like this and I'm not gonna get sick here!",

This was very obvious favoritism or racism, I should say, experience that I ever felt. We( Asian woman and Black guy)walked in, and they welcomed and seated us. Then a white man walked in and they welcomed and seated him. They didn't even ask what kind of drinks we wanted, but one of the servers asked  the white man who came later. And a couple of minutes later, a white woman walked in. And seconds later a waitress took the drinks to the table for the white man and to another table for a white woman. Finally she came to us and ask  what we wanted to drink. Really? We closed our menus and we were sitting obviously that we were ready to order. They didn't even acknowledge us at all! So I told my boyfriend, \"Let's go\"  I had to let them know why we were leaving.  So I  asked for a manager. Of course he or she wasn't there. So I told one of servers that we were here first and you guys were serving them who came later after us. All she said was \"sorry\" trying to give me a hug. If you were trying to hug me because I am your sister, you should have served us fairly.  It really made me sad and disappointed.",

I'm a fan of the $5 roll specials (look on the white board behind the sushi chefs) - these rotate but you can usually count on some sort of tuna roll and a few surprises. The tempura is always excellent - light and crisp just how it should be!   A few tips for Sushi Ken newbies... -The food comes out as it is ready. That means you may get sushi, then edamame, then soup, then some more sushi, then a bowl of ramen. Just embrace it and call them \"courses\". -If there is something that you don't want in a sushi roll, just mention it to the server or write it on the sushi order page. They are wonderfully accommodating. -It gets busy on weekend evenings, so come a bit early if you don't want to wait. -Don't be that guy who is waiting for a table and hovering over the poor folks sitting at the corner spot of the sushi bar. Go outside - the weather is nice.",

By the time we left, all the tables were full as was the sushi bar, and there was a wait!  The menu itself is a little confusing only because there are menus everywhere.  There is the main menu, a sushi menu, a bento box menu, plus signs all over the restaurant about specials and sushi.  Our waitress was pleasant and helped us navigate what specials we could order based on what food we wanted.  The boy wanted Curry Udon and got their daily special of a noodle dish and a choice of app/sushi/roll ($15).  I ordered the Noodle combo and picked Shio Butter Ramen with butter and Gyudon ($13).  I also ordered the White Tuna Tataki from the $5 special menu.  Both items came with a choice of side salad or edamame.   Overall we were very pleased with the food.  My ramen came with traditional toppings and was very rich and hearty.  The Gyudon was a pleasant surprise, just the right amount of savory and sweet.  We both enjoyed the Gyoza app that The Boy got with his combo, the wrapper was crisp and airy and the meat inside was well seasoned.  The Tuna Tataki was good, but was different than I expected.  It came as a roll stuffed with White Tuna and cucumber and then was topped with more White Tuna.  It was worth it for $5 though.  All and all, we both enjoyed our visit and I enjoyed the bill, the two of us left stuffed for $32.  I still keep thinking about the ramen and kick myself for not taking my leftovers home!",

I know sashimi, i am not new to this. The salmon i received was so pungent it left a lingering taste in my mouth. My husband who would eat anything agreed, it was fishy and unlike the salmon in his chirashi. It was a cheap cut of the tail and it was not treated properly.  I do not mess around with fishy fish. I sent it back. The waitress argued. She did not apologize, did not ask if I wanted to order something else. I had lost my appetite anyways. As i sat and watched my husband and daughter eat I could see the servers huddled in the corner.   She only returned to tell me \" I tried your food it tasted fine!\" and walked away again with a huff.  I dont know why Im surprised by such rudeness and audacity. As if I wanted to send back my food and first meal of the day? We had been running errands all morning. I was famished! The accusatory tone and stares were so appalling.  No wonder this place is empty. Aside  from the gaudy decor, stained carpet and filfthy restroom, now i know why they tint the windows, so no one can see how gross it is inside.   Thank god i sent my food back. I would have surely paid for it later with sickness.  Thank you previous yelpers about the tip about the credit card fraud. We made sure to pay and tip in cash. Shouldnt have bothered though. but karma...so I did. (tip)",

    "text": "So far, the Sushi Ken is my top 3 Sushi Restaurant in Arizona. I believe that they are the most authentic Japanese Restaurant in Arizona. My Japanese friend also agreed that.   -Price and Quantity: You may have to spend least $15 for one meal, so it is little bit above average. However, the amount of food is larger than other Japanese restaurants. If you order combination, you have to order the dish you do not like and it is expensive, unless you share with other person.   -Dish 1 Review: Nigiri(sushi) -- Spent $4.50 -- 3.8/5.0 stars Nigiri sushi is thinker than any other sushi restaurants and it taste better. $4.50 salmon nigiri is not even expensive when you see the amount of the food. Dish 1 re-order? YES  -Dish 2 Review: Chirashi -- Spent $17.00 -- 4.0/5.0 stars *Chirashi: selection of sushi rice, brown rice, or spring mix and comes with your selection of 5 different types of sashimi or other ingredients)  It was my first time trying Japanese Chirashi. Other Japanese restaurants serve standard Chirashi but Sushi Ken provides a piece of paper for customer and you can make your OWN Chirashi. I ordered 5 different types of sashimi and sushi rice. Sushi Ken serves pretty tasty rice and amount of sashimi was way bigger than what I expected. I shared my dish with my friend.  Dish 2 re-order? YES  -Dish 3 Review: Tonkatsu ramen soup -- Spent $8.50 -- 4.0/5.0 stars  Special about Tonkatsu Ramen was soup taste. It is very delicious and you can ask for spicy powder to make spicier! Noodle is delicious but not amazing. It is average.  Dish 3 re-order? YES  -Suggestions to restaurant:  Menu is too complex. I like the food options but the menu is disorganize and had hard time to find dish I want. I went with my friends and they all agreed. Also, they write special menu on board, it is readable but disorganize.   -Comparison with other restaurant: Sushi Ken Vs. Shimogamo  I would go Sushi Ken, when I really want to eat lot sushi with limited budget. I am not really expecting special sushi taste from Sushi Ken. When I want good sushi, I would go here.  When I want something special, I will go Shimogamo. Their Salmon Nigiri has special flavor. But not I am not a huge fan of their rolls, very small and didn't like it.  -Overall Restaurant Rating: --Service: 2.5/5.0 stars -- One time they include tips even we were party of three. Also, they do not have standard serving skills and workflow.  --Menu: 3.8/5.0 stars -- They have many Japanese food that you can't try from other restaurant.  However, I did not try all menu, yet. So, I cannot give food review for that.  --Desirable to revisit? YES, I went there 3 more times after my first visit.",

We sent back our sushi as it was mushy, sloppy piles of rolls that I wouldn't feed my dog. Our Saki had a strange taste and our ramen was mediocre to say the least. We barely ate and I have been feeling nauseous all afternoon. We have been told the owner opened Sushi Sen in Scottsdale which we will take the ride and try. Don't waste a perfectly good afternoon or evening eating here.",

    "text": "I have been a customer here for about 5 years. The food WAS great. However, I came with my family today and this place is nothing compare to what it use to be.   I have not seen the original sushi chef a older gentleman for the past few times I was here. We usually order sashimi and ramen. The sashimi's quality is very not stable. Sometimes, the fish was cut to thin slices, other times it is kind frozen, but is not too hard. The freshness has gone done as well.    Today, I order the bento box with yellowtail sashimi, yellow tail roll and tempura. My yellowtail sashimi's color is a little off and most importantly it came FROZEN, so it is very hard, like ice cubes. I talked to one of the waitress and she took my bento tray and went to the sushi chef. A few mins later, the SAME yellowtail sashimi came back and was cut into THIN slices, but it's still very icey. It taste like fish ice slices.  Also, they were not even busy, there are 3 tables included ours.   I was too hungry and don't want my tempura get soggy.  I ate the tempura and the yellowtail roll. The sashimi still kind frozen, so I was not able to eat it. I don't know if it's against health code to bring back to the kitchen pieces of fish that the customer had ate and cut it to thin slices and bring it back.   I told another waitress about this when she brought the check. She offered me half off MY MEAL ($6). The reason for that was I did not eat the sashimi. I feel offend by this. I don't need $6 off. The way they bring back my thin slices of frozen fish was very unprofessional and shows lack of respect to customers.  The way they handle this, it's not acceptable.  I talked to 2 waitress about this and no management was ever involved.  I start to wonder was there even a manager at this place.   Lastly, this place is going down if nothing is going to change.  My family and I will never come back.",

    "text": "Sushi Ken is one of the better Japanese restaurants in the Phoenix area. The quality of the food is consistent, the prices relatively reasonable, and the service is efficient.   They serve a variety of lunch specials that are in the $10 range. However, there are so many options to choose from the whiteboards surrounding the restaurant, that I would recommend checking out those options. I've been to Sushi Ken have ordered the Love Boat (~$65) when I'm with a big party of people. When I'm by myself, I like to order the chunky yellowtail roll ($5) or the appetizer and noodle combo (~$15). I recently tried the mini chirachi bowl, spicy miso udon, hamachi sashimi, and soft shell crab roll. All of them were fresh and delicious. The side salad that they serve with their combinations is pretty lackluster. I would recommend getting the miso soup or edeame instead.  The place gets busy during dinner time, so I would recommend making a reservation if you're coming in with a large party. Otherwise, the tables move relatively fast and I would not be discouraged by the wait.",

When I stepped in on Friday it was busy, so it definitely fueled my anticipation. But, after my meal I was wondering why all these people didn't just head down the street to (this other sushi place I know).  The service meant well -- a little slow, but friendly enough. The atmosphere was kind of cool -- kind of that well-worn Asian restaurant vibe I remember from San Francisco. Only this place doesn't really serve up \"the goods.\" The sushi was lacking. Some of it was alright. But some was just...\"no.\" Namely the Spicy Tuna; it was this bland, texture-less pink paste that I assume was made out of tuna, but you couldn't really prove it.  Anyway, I was bummed because I really wanted to like Sushi Ken; I heard such great things about it, and it's really close to my neighborhood. But walking away, all I could think was, \"Meh. I've experienced better.\"",

Notice there are no stars for their food.  I read a number of reviews before coming here and so many people raved about this being the best Japanese food in the valley...well, i can assure that does NOT include their sushi.  That's all i got (they should probably change their name btw!) and it truly was just bad. Yes, it was edible, but hardly.  Another reviewer mentioned that when getting his rolls he didn't pay attention to them making the rolls because he was eating his miso soup and edamame...well i fell prey to this as well. The first part of my spicy tuna roll was pretty good, but the pieces were overly large (4 of them) compared to the other 4...When i finally reached the other 4 pieces i noticed the consistency changed: the rice was hard and chewy and the tuna was dry and just not appetizing. I also ordered a California roll...the crab was dry, the avacado was brown and again, the rice was hard.  Now, Sir who is \"making\" my sushi rolls RIGHT in front of me....how many times did you have to sneak each piece over to complete my order without me seeing/knowing? I saw you make my to-go order fresh--as i watched you the entire time. Not cool.  Do yourself a favor and try another sushi place. I can't speak for anything else but their sushi, but i would NOT recommend this place to one single person. Not even a person i hated. And to be quite honest, i feel as though i should take a star away for as awful as i feel right now--i didn't even finish 2 rolls. There is no reason for me to feel this way....just saying.",

The rice bowls contain tremendously hearty portions and always fill me up. The food is flavorful and the setting is perfect for a group of people. When I've had sushi here, it's been delicious as well.  If you're looking for a well-rounded meal, I'd recommend Sushi Ken over Mido Sushi, Teharu, and Sushi Eye. This place is great.",

The food is so fresh, the taste is light not greasy, incredibly amazing. It shows that they are always full no matter the time of the evening. The cost is very reasonable and unlike some other reviewers I am not bothered by the decor at all, There are many beautiful restaurants that in my opinion serve just very average quality food. I do care for the quality of food not so much the decor especially in Oriental restaurants.  Yes, there might be a wait if you arrive at the rush hours but it's so worth it. My family's favorites are the soft shell crab tempura, the croquettes, any noodle or rice dish, the sushi are memorable and I usually don't care that much for sushi anywhere else, the ones at Ken's melt in your mouth. The service is always very busy and I am just so thankful that they can serve me that fantastic food. They are worth a trip even from far away. I've called a Japanese friend of mine to come try them when she will be next visiting us. This is a 10 star restaurant!",

I thought this place is a must-go-back-and-bring-my-friends. (because service was not up to par, I only gave it 4-stars)",

There are more servers, but only a couple seem to know what they are doing leading to a severely understaffed place. I've seen a couple just run around yet not accomplish anything.   The quality of food doesn't seem as high anymore either. The portion size also has shrunk. What draws me back?   It seems like they are cutting corners than trying to be an amazing restaurant. It's no longer a place I really care about going to anymore. Such a shame",

And I sort of got the impression that because I am gaijin (ie: not Japanese) I may have pissed them off even more.  Food still tasted the same (great) but the ambiance and the attitude really, REALLY rubbed me the wrong way.  Needless to say--no tip.  I would have RELISHED the opportunity that the other reviewer had when tall and nasty followed you out to the parking lot and demanded a tip--I guarantee she wouldn't have found that to be a pleasant experience.  You all just lost a customer and a fan--congratulations nasty face!!!",

My husband and I are addicted to the Chirachi bowl which is packed full of rice, seaweed, and piled high with the chef's selection of the freshest raw fish.  This incredible bowl of deliciousness is $20!  You couldn't find this much fresh raw fish at a restaurant for this price anywhere else in Phoenix.    If I get the Chirachi bowl idea stuck in my head, I have to have it and nothing else will satisfy my craving.  Speaking of...I think I'll order one for take out right now!  ;)  I rate Sushi Ken at the highest rating possible: 5 Noms: \"Nom, Nom, Nom, Nom, & NOM!\" :D",

Their pork shumai, ohhh my god, it is OUT OF THIS WORLD.   Their ramen is super super good but the only thing about it is that its a bit salty. I kept eating the ramen and the salt in the broth just builds up on my taste buds so by the time I only have a couple of bites left, all I can taste is salt. Good experience but wouldn't order ramen again.",

I was like OK but what about the expiration date. The certificate does not say anything about voided with new ownership. In my eyes, the name is the same and why should I care if you are under a new ownership. The life lesson is not to buy the restaurant gift certificates.

The Udong noodle that I ordered today was half cooked that it was very hard. Also, Chirashi fish were so low quality that fishes were mushy and sliding under my teeth. That much fishes were far from fresh.  When I talked to the server about the half-cooked noodle, I expected a simple apology. Instead, she told me \"No one ever complained about the noodle. You are the only one ever complained. We always use a timer to cook noodle\". I asked, \"do you think I am telling a lie?\" She was mumbling in a small voice... \"no...\"  Everyone can make a mistake. The problem is, instead of accepting the mistake and apologizing, she denied and treated me a liar. Eventually, she said \"I am sorry\" after I complained about the unfresh fish quality and then she left very fast as if escaping.  You just lost 10 years of regular. I don't think I will come back to that place again.",

Previously, they had chunky rolls that were available for $5 - those same rolls are still available for $10 but the fish quality seems to have taken a hit. The fish we received was doused in pure sriracha and the taste of the fish couldn't come through.

More than likely, you'll have to get up and go to the cash register or wave them down yourselves. They also have weird rules and fees about splitting checks, so don't do it. I learned the hard way. So if that's not how you like your dining experience, try somewhere else.   BUT, If you're looking for larger than average portions, low prices, and ridiculously good Japanese comfort food - this is it. The menu will probably take you 20 minutes to get through, it's like the Asian equivalent of the Cheesecake Factory when it comes to choices. Don't want to try one plate? They got you covered. They have plenty of options so that you can combine entrees at a low cost. Food moochers paradise! No more having to secretly hope that your friend orders something that you can 'taste test.'   Sushi-wise, I've NEVER seen anywhere else be as generous as they are with their sashimi slices. They have more unique varieties as well and have adopted the soy paper as well. I can go on, but if you must know how good the sushi is, I've spotted the owner of Sakana eating at the sushi bar a couple of times. Scandaloussss.",

I had chance to try variety of food in the past including ramen, sushi, tempura, donburi, curry, grilled fish to name a few.  They are not bad, I am sure one can find similar quality restaurant in Japan. For me they all tasted like cafeteria type food. Cafeteria food serves its purpose and they are there to please diverse people.  It's just such a drive for me to visit, unless I am already in the area, I don't think I would make an effort to drive there just to eat their food. Thus being said, if you are in the area, and with picky person or not sure what to eat, this place is a good option to visit.",

First of all, they are open 7 days a week! None of this open for only dinner on weekends or crazy stuff.  Sushi came out so fast and everything tasted fresh. I ordered my custom chirashi bowl where you get to pick five different things. I went with spicy salmon, spicy tuna, avocado, masago, and spicy scallops. I was in heaven. I especially loved how I was able to order all that fresh fish without rice and with \"spring mix\"  My husband ordered the chicken katsu and fried rice. Along with a crunch roll. Everything was tasty. They were busy all night and every table was full, but service was great!  Can't wait to go back.",

Chirashi dinner is also lack of quality, I used to love to order it here a lot before since it was the best I've had in Phoenix but now they ruin it by taking ikura, ika, and unagi out of the bowl. Beef short ribs ($16.95) were over cooked covered in oil and very chewy. Overall disappointed.",

The bathrooms are simply disgusting.  The walkway to the bathrooms show you the back door to the kitchen which will instantly take your appetite away.   In 2016 they had a shake up in management that resulted in a new floor to replace the moldy carpet they used to have. Us regulars smiled and prayed for more. Next they ripped down some of the hand written menu items. Then they put up $3 IKEA paper lanterns. Cool. Then they stopped! The tables are worn out. The bathrooms (did I mention that) are worse than the ones at a bus station.   PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE Sushi Ken Management: if you are reading this get an interior designer and spend $20k to remodel the bathrooms.  You will see the results with more customer visits.",

    "text": "An all-time favorite of ours!  My in-laws drive from Peoria to eat here weekly because they are crazy.  They did change owners in the last year and portion and quality dipped a bit but has recently redeemed itself again.  Portion and taste similar to before but price higher.  The price of their combos keeps going up over the years but the value is still justified with noodle combos.   For around $15 you get BOTH a bowl of ramen or udon and an entree.  We always choose the tonkotsu ramen with the spicy chirashi.  Ramen is nothing special but does the job.  The spicy chirashi is their name for the Korean dish \"hwe dup bap\" which is small chunks of mixed sashimi (usually tuna, salmon, white fish, yellowtail) in salad, subtly sweet egg cubes, and rice all mixed together with sesame oil and spicy sweet sauce.  This dish alone is $12-15 at other restaurants without the ramen.  The sauce has recently been a lot spicier than usual so beware and add less.   Another favorite of mine is their hamachi Kama combo.  It's like a bento box with a giant perfectly grilled hamachi Kama, a tootsie roll, white or fried rice, edamame or salad, miso soup, shrimp and veg tempura, 3 slices of tuna sashimi, and orange slices.   The service is not the best but the great food outweighs that.",

    "text": "I've tried and retried and retried during lunch time to like Sushi Ken, but I truly do not understand the popularity of this place, maybe because it's the only non commercial sushi restaurant in Ahwatukee.... who knows. A big turnoff is just the atmosphere, the dirty carpet, the old paint and dirty ceiling, the strange smell, the tacky printed out food specials taped all over the place, maybe its me but it just feels dirty and when I go to dine on sushi, I want the place to feel clean. I started coming here and ordering Sashimi, it's an OK quality, then I started ordering the specials, awesome deal: an entree with an appetizer choice. I prefer the Spicy Ramen with the Mini Chirachi.   Last week I brought a friend here. He had sushi: the Spicy Tuna Roll, which he thought was OK, the Hamachi Sashimi, which he thought was big slices but no taste, and the salmon sushi which he asked if they could slice a couple slivers of jalapeno on, which he though was OK too. Everything done and we get the bill. Not to be a ball buster but I will be, they charged us $2.00 for the slivers of jalapeno on the salmon sushi. when asked about the extra charge the waitress said \"it's a $1.00 extra for each order for jalapeno and we had 2 orders (see photo attached). Really! When I said we live in the hot pepper state and I can buy a jalapeno for 25 cents, her explanation was we are a restaurant!   When you nickle and dime your customer you lose your customers and for the already on the fence dirtiness of the place, you lost me and any recommendations!",

I have given Ken's more business than they ever deserved over the past couple of years solely due to it's close proximity to home and work. The experience I had there last weekend will certainly be my last.   In the past I had ordered things which didn't taste that fresh, one particular time I ordered Uni (sea urchin), a favorite of mine. I will forego any comparisons in taste for the sake of the weary, but let's just say it was horrible. So, I politely sent it back, only to be told when the waitress returned that Uni was not in season.... So, I should naturally know this? Hmmm... How about you just apologize and not blame the customer for foolishly eating what you served??  The experience this past weekend was very similar, the spicy Yellowtail tasted like it had been left in Tupperware in the sun for a day or two, so I politely sent it back. I was told that perhaps Yellowtail isn't my fish, as though I had never had a bite of sushi before in my life.  Apparently at Ken's, the customer is always wrong. Be warned, go elsewhere, like Sushi Eye or one of several others in the area who serve quality food without insult.",

So of course we had to get it!  The entree came with sushi and green beans.  I ordered gyoza and ice green tea.  The gyoza was ok.  The iced green tea was the real thing.  It was so good.  Then came the Charsui ramen.  The ramen was very good.  The charsui was not bad.  The soup base is soy sauce so it was a little salty for me.",

    "text": "I live just down the road from Sushi Ken, and I am definitely a regular. I also live down the street from Ra, and there aren't two restaurants which could be more opposite! Sushi Ken is  family owned and operated, very starkly decorated, and usually filled with asian families (and often screaming children). So if you're seeking a hip, trendy, sushi scene, then you probably should head down the street to Ra. However, if you want authentic Japanese food and fresh, inexpensive sushi (and possibly a wait to be seated) then head on over to Sushi Ken.  There was a point when I was eating here 2-3 times a week! I also made a point of systematically trying everything on the menu, and I can recommend it all. Almost. I wasn't a fan of the ginger beef dish. I don't even know if that's still on the menu...  I have a Japanese friend who first introduced me to the cuisine in college, and when Sushi Ken first opened I told her she had to go. Sure enough, she fell in love with the place and now makes a weekly trek (even though she lives and works in North Phoenix!) I think this shows the authenticity of the place -- there are so many authentic Japanese dishes on the menu that you won't find at a typical sushi restaurant. For example, she loves to order sanma (a whole fish steamed, mackerel I believe), which she said she hadn't eaten since she last visited Japan.   Now, as for my favorites. For lunch - you can't beat the price of makanouchi.  It's this HUMONGOUS bento box filled with a variety of  yummy delights (great for when you can't decide what to get). Tuna sashimi, cooked salmon, tempura, 3 california rolls, an egg roll, squid salad, seaweed salad, karokke (breaded potato cake), pickled vegetables, two pieces of tamago (sushi omelette), a wonton, and rice. All for $7.50!! It's a steal, especially since makanouchi costs nearly twice as much at dinner.    Oh, and did I mention every lunch special comes with soybeans or salad and miso soup? As if the meals themselves didn't already fill you to the brim!   I have a sister who is one of the pickiest people I know. My friend Eric is probably the pickiest person I know. I've taken both of them to Sushi Ken, and both of them ordered the teriyaki chicken, and both of them loved it.  And both are eager to go back! So, it's also a great place to take a crowd, since they have something for even the pickiest of eaters.   Also, I love their tuna tataki roll -- lightly seared tuna, with ginger and scallions. Absolutely delicious. All of their sushi is fresh, and they certainly beat the prices of all the other sushi restaurants in the area.  I'm also a fan of the iced green tea - and the servers know me well enough to just leave a pitcher on the table. :)  The servers, and Ken himself, work extremely hard  -- at one point, when the restaurant first opened, there was just two servers and one of them told me that they had not taken a day off in 72 days!! Luckily, they seem to have done well enough to hire many new servers, and an extra sushi chef, and the original gals don't seem as overworked.  There have been times when I've gone on a random Thursday night and had to wait a good 30 minutes in line before being seated. This isn't extremely unusual at peak hours at Sushi Ken, although since they have hired more help it seems the waiting has gone down some. They won't seat people unless the server can immediately attend to you, which is why there will be several tables open and no one is being seated at them.    I have yet to find another restaurant in the east valley which comes close to Sushi Ken in terms of quality of food and price.",

    "text": "Thought I reviewed this place already.  Since it's been about a year and a half since I last ate here (twice visited, ate once), I plan to give SK another try very soon.  Thought I'd just get the ball rolling now...  I met with a few people here the first time, but wasn't feeling hungry enough, so I just joined in the conversations and just observed the food as they were delivered to the table.  Most of my companions that night didn't actually order sushi, and instead, opted for Chinese dishes or Japanese noodles and other hot dishes.  The low menu prices did pique my interest, so when hunger pangs struck me a couple of hours later, I asked relatives if they wanted to join me for sushi (and they did).  As noted in the number of stars I posted above, I was not impressed with the rolls/nigiri I tried that evening.  I found the sushi (vinegared rice) lacking in the flavor department, and the roll ingredients to be subpar.  The selections we shared between us were so bland, I can't even recall which rolls and nigiri we had ordered!    Since it's been almost two years, and a lot can change in two years (for good or bad), I will be back to give Sushi Ken another try.",

I vary up my choices and with 3 columns to pick and choose you can get creative. I like that you can get either the Sushi or Sashimi Lunch ($3 difference) but I prefer Sashimi... This time around one of us got Yellow Tail, Tuna and Salmon...   Most recently I had the Gyudon (Beef bowl) from column 1, the Combo Tempura (Shrimp, veggies, etc...) from Column 2 and then the Sashimi I mentioned before. Lunch is served with soup and of course, you have to have some green tea to accompany the meal...  Location is a strip mall and the staff is friendly, prompt and tentative so cal expect a good experience. Sushi bar and counter are available for people and if you get a chance, try the marinated baby octopus... so good",

I moved away from Phoenix two years ago, but I am so incredibly nostalgic for the delicious home style Japanese cooking that Sushi Ken offers that I came to yelp just to gaze at photos of their food!   The menu is EXTENSIVE and the deals are great. There are always specials and additions to the menu written on whiteboards throughout the restaurant, so don't forget to check those out before ordering. I would always get a chirashi bowl and tonkotsu ramen, but I've eaten here so many times and even celebrated a couple birthdays here, so I've explored a lot of the menu. The tonkotsu broth is phenomenal, thick and rich in flavor. It's great on a cold day or if you're not feeling well. The fried rice is nice too and I've tried many of their sushi rolls. Everything on the menu is delicious!",

    "text": "Prologue: My fiancee and I were looking for a new sushi experience for our weekly Saturday evening dinner date and a search on Yelp of sushi restaurants close to home yielded this restaurant along with some good reviews.  The Plot: It was apparent from our review of the menu, as well as the signage posted in the restaurant, that they offered a greater variety items compared to the other sushi restaurants we've already tried.  So, we decided to be adventurous and order several dishes to share, including Deep Fried Baby Octopus, Pork Tonkatsu, Dynamite, Soft Shell Crab Roll, Shrimp Tempura Roll, Rainbow Roll, and Uni Nigiri.  The Scene: Most impressive for us was the presentation, particularly the extra effort that apparently had been given to plating the maki rolls. The Soft Shell Crab roll was actually a little creepy looking, which made it even more fun to eat.  All of the other dishes were good and on par with favorable dining experiences I've had in the past. The Baby Octopus was warm, crispy, and yummy, the Pork Tonkatsu was juicy, tender, and delectable, and the Dynamite was savory and satisfying.  The service was courteous, our orders were all promptly delivered to our table, and the meal, overall, was quite delightful.  The Rest of the Story: Everything was as good as expected and there were no disappointments. At the same time, there were no real stars in this meal. Considering the variety and the number of specialty items on their menu, another visit might reveal something more memorable.  My fiancee was a little surprised when the tab came to about $70; however, having had similar dining experiences in the past I was fully expecting to pay that much.  Epilogue: The quality of the food and the variety of items on the menu easily deserve 3 stars.  Never the less, this dining experience did not rank among the best $70 meals we've had and so we elected to not award a 4th star.  Photo Design: by Billie Z.",

The food tasted amazing as always, and the service was faster than usual. The way they changed the layout of the restaurant makes it seem bigger and also gives the customers a little bit more privacy. We got the tempura entree and the spicy miso ramen, both were amazing and fresh! Very impressed with the noodle texture and depth of flavor in the broth, though it was a tad bit salty. Will definitely be back soon!",

And their soft shell crab roll is the bomb. Will recommend to anyone and everyone..!!!!  Also 10starss for the service.",

I ordered the Ten Zaru Soba. It was amazing. The flavor was incredible. I'm always worried that flavors will be too strange but it wasn't at all.   The Soba comes with a salad and half California roll before the main dish which was great. Then the main dish is a plate of typical Japanese noodles (You can order them cold or warm. Mine were cold) with a really flavorful dipping sauce (it's kinda like soy sauce but with a different flavor) and then tempura fried veggies and shrimp.   Make sure to put the onions and ground up radish in the noodle sauce.   I'll definitely be back.",

The place is really out dated inside which I don't mind but to start with I ordered the chicken teriyaki and me and my lunch date shared a California roll. First they started with this soup that was disgusting, as well as the salad was just lettuce and a ginger dressing. When the food came they serve some strange things with the chicken. The chicken was very bland I didn't taste any flavor. I literally took 1 bite, When the waiter came by I asked him to take the plate away and please take it off my bill. He said because I had already ordered it he couldn't take it off but he could take half off. That really rubbed me the wrong way.  Second the California roll was not edible. My lunch date didn't like her dish either. We spent 25$ and only maybe had 5 bites. I would suggest to stay far away...don't try this place.",

And she was so rude, almost like \"wow your going to come in and eat when we're about to close?!\" I didn't tip her well because I thought she a very rude to us. When she saw the ticket all she could say was \"REALLY!? WOW! WOW! WOW! REALLY??\" She didn't even bother to come over and ask what was the problem. Safe to say we won't be going back there",

I went here two days ago and I was slightly dissapointed only because they raised the price since the last time I've been here which was probably half a year ago. The combination ramen + an entree used to be 11.50 but is now 12.50. Yes its only a dollar but that wasnt all. The specialty rolls that they have for 5$ is the same price however the size of it was cut in half from what I remember. It still gets a 4 stars because although they did raise the price and cut some portions, they are still relatively cheaper than most sushi restaurants. There quality is good but not the best and they offer a variety with there combo plate which is a slamming deal still. When i go with my friends we each get a combo (tongetsu ramen with spicey tuna donburi is my favorite) and a few orders off their sushi rolls off their 5$ special to share which is super filling. Service is always great here also.",

I know Japanese so I was talking to the sushi chefs about the restaurant, etc. As I was eating, they kept pulling out new Yellowtail, since they kept moving through orders. Amazingly fresh!!!  They have ALL the important Japanese standards: Ramen, Soba, Donburi as well as tons of fresh fish and amazing roll creations.  Wonderful example of a True Japanese-owned business. Great Job!!",

I had never eaten this fish before and, because the server had described it as moist and one of their popular choices, I decided to give it a try. One taste and it seemed very dry and overcooked to me. When I mentioned it to our server, she said the hamachi fish is similar to halibut and is a drier fish (i thought it was moist?) Obviously, I was not going to be accommodated in any way. In my opinion any fish, no matter how moist, will end up dry if cooked too long. My spouse's salmon was cooked perfectly btw. Our table was ignored from that point on until the check arrived. Needless to say, I only ate half the fish. My suggestion is to stick with food items you are familiar with if you choose to dine here. Will I come back? The jury is still out on that as I live in Los Angeles. Maybe I will try the Sushi Ken out my way and order the hamachi!",

I'm sick of places that has random ppl making sushi because they either: put too much rice in the nigiri..the rice is too sour or the fish cut is too thin/thick.  Fish tastes relatively fresh...not the best but def. not the worst. I'd give it a 8/10.  This still caters to the traditional Americans who want an assortment of rolls but for those that just want some good old nigiri - you can't beat this place. Place is relatively large so seating is pretty quick.",

The sushi is soooo fresh and they always carry out items that are not available in other sushi place like uni or sweet little octopus that I love! Their ramen is also superb and if you come here for lunch, don't forget to check in their special of the day cause they offer a great price with superb taste and lots of variety for lunch!!

The staff was rude, unprofessional and clueless.  The sad part, we are regular customers.  Well, former customers.  Sorry Sushi Ken...

Service - not too rude, till you have to deal with the son.  Too much attitude, eyeliner and absolutely no customer service.  Although I did get much better service when came in with an asian male. Is this the typical japanese attitude toward women? Food was still mediocre to yucky.  Quality of food -- not very fresh and very cheap ingredients. The fish was obviously refrigerated for too long.    Too much msg.  The nori rolls are a rip-off.  Even after pointing out to the staff that only half of the roll contained the crab, they chose not to do anything to remedy the situation.  Seriously? How the hell do they keep customers?  Ambiance  --  not much, seemed family friendly till we came back with the family.  The waitress was unaccomodating with miserable attitude toward the kids.   The kids hated the place and were not impressed with the food.   And they both love sushi.   Overall, suprised that so many asians frequent them or that they are still in business.

No dressing in the salad and the green was turning pink at the base. After 10 minutes we asked who it was for and where was the salad dressing. Waiter said soup is for who ever wants it and he took the salad away to put dressing on it. He returned with one more soup bowl and the salad plate.   Another 15 mns passed and one benko plate finally arrived.  We waited 15 more mns for the second benko plate so we can eat together to no avail.  We signed at the waiter to complain about this. My plate was getting cold and my son still didnt have his order.  The waiter replied that it had only been 10 mns and that if he was the customer he would not have said anything or complain and we should be more patient.  My son took it personally ( since he was the customer) and he got even more offended by the waiter's remark. Restaurant Manager came to our table and told us that there was miscommunication between cooks. She offered us a complimentary lunch and confirmed that  food was going to be ready in 5 minutes or so... I replied that l was done with lunch here and l got up.  We left and ended up having lunch at Thai Basil, which by the way served us right away.",

I missed its food sooo much (especially the katsu curry) when I was back in Boston. Service is always welcoming and nice (very very polite). As can be seen this is a family run restaurant and there is only one waitress. I personally work part time as japanese food waitress back in Boston and I totally understand how service just simply can not be met when there are over 6-7 tables to be served at the same time (they are often full-house with one waitress).

Just about any roll you can think of is on their menu. They also have great lunch specials for non-sushi meals like chicken teriyaki etc.. I tried the Sweet Potato Roll and Deluxe Dragon Roll, both were awesome! Those are my two favorite rolls at other sushi spots, so I decided to order my usual. At Sushi Ken, the rolls were prepared a bit differently than expected, but different wasn't a bad thing. I think all sushi places have a slightly different recipe for making a roll. I was impressed with Sushi Ken's quality of ingredients. The service was also pretty good. It was lunch time and we didn't wait too long for our food to arrive. Our table of 3 was very happy with everything we ordered and we can't wait to return! Maybe next time, we'll go for happy hour!",

The sauce was maybe a little watery, but the flavor was perfect, and the pork was perfectly breaded and stayed intact.  I could see the service being less attentive if it is busy, but given my experience, I would overlook it for the quality you get in the middle of a desert.",

After waiting sometime for my meal ask the server where is my meal he goes to the manager and the cook. After comes up to explaining that the chef and  sous chef messed up the order and then begins to tell me that if he was a customer I would've not said anything about the food being late like basically telling me to shut up and keep waiting. I've never ever in my life have ever had any server tell me this how dare an establishment allow a server to say/ even work there is crazy.

Everyone else at the table had mixed reviews, but it's mines that count! Haha! I plan to give Sushi Ken another try since I didn't get their famous Udon Noodles. Until then stay tuned.

The fish was always fresh and plating was excellent. As we came here more often we became more adventurous. Now, my wife always gets the Spicy Miso Udon. The broth is just like miso soup with an extra kick. The noodles are cooked perfectly and aren't soggy. We always recommend this place to our friends",

We had to ask another waiter to get us some water. Our assigned waitress also forgot to put in our order at first and then managed to put in the wrong order.

Perhaps a little healthier than it would be if it was cooked in a pan, but extremely untasty. The sauce is also a bit too heavy for the meal.  Definitely go to try their other dishes, just be warned about the chicken!",

I was kinda saddened about the sushi, how much it was, and how I was still hungry. The amount of sushi and the quality is, I believe not up to par for what you have to pay. For the price, I would definitely go somewhere else...possibly Sakana (cheaper and better service). The service here is decent. I did have to waive down the waitress a couple times to refill my glass of water. The atmosphere is alright as well. The restaurant is clean. I would only recommend this restaurant for lunch (when they have the lunch special).",

    "text": "Of all the places of Sushi I have been to, Sushi Ken stays as my favorite from the beginning to the end. However, I would usually be happy to give this place 5 stars, but for some reason, I'm a bit unhappy.  Pros: Sushi Ken's fish is extremely fresh, and the waiters show their best behavior when serving us. Unfortunately, the waiters strain a little to keep up with the constant ordering (this place is exasperatingly crowded during dinner time) and I give them credit for that. You can save A LOT OF MONEY if you look at any of the whiteboards posted along the walls of the restaurant. We ordered the Hamachikama entree(-steamed yellowtail, at least that was what I found when I looked it up). It includes a giant piece of cooked yellowtail with radish, a crispy California roll, pieces of tuna sashimi, shrimp and vegetable tempura, and an orange for only about $14. It even comes with your choice of soup or soybeans. It's a lot to eat, and we can hardly finish it when two people share the lot. The sushi boats are also decent for their size, though they can be extremely pricey, since one boat costs $60(and in case you're wondering, you don't keep the boat.) The hot/cold soba (or ramen) comes with a mini chirashi on the house (you can choose something different) for $15. They also serve certain rolls for only $5, and all of these are listed in the whiteboards (besides the boat). The bathrooms are fairly decent as they keep them clean, and for some reason, I noticed a Febreeze bottle sitting on top of the toilet tank even though there is an air freshener plugged into the wall. No wonder it smelled like baked cookies in there.  Cons: Unfortunately, their location is small, and due to the popularity of the restaurant, there can be a bit of a waiting time. There is a rip in the carpet, but that doesn't influence my eating in any way. They only have one cashier, so sometimes I see a huge pile of checks on the table next to the cash register. Unless you're a SERIOUS regular/friend of theirs, they don't have the time to greet or say goodbye to you. The staff are extremely rushed, but they do treat every customer equally. They simply need to expand their location, hire more workers, and get more tables.   Obviously, I'm coming back. This is the best sushi restaurant in my area, even though it is very cramped inside. I highly recommend this place to anyone who reads this. But come early, because like I said...it's crazy in there during 7-8 pm.",

This place has gone down hill since being taken over by new owners. A long wait is the norm here but that was only worth it as loyal customers to the original owners.   To speak to the food quality...The noodles in the ramen were over cooked, soggy and had absorbed the over salty broth, turning the noodles the bronze color of the broth. The bamboo shoot in the ramen was also soggy as if the entire bowl of ramen had been sitting for 30min before serving it to us. I would have thought this was the case but the broth was very hot when served.   The previous owners kept the Japanese tradition of high quality and great attention to detail. It was obvious that they cared deeply about sharing their Japanese heritage with the community. Now, it's just becoming the run of the mill Japanese restaurant like every other in town. Eventually fading into the sea of Asian restaurants before closing its doors for good.",

Spicy Miso Chashu Ramen was the highlight. Abundant broth, plenty of ramen, bouncing with flavor, and lots of heat.  Shrimp Tempura, California Roll, and Gyoza were unremarkable though. Shrimp was skinny and tough. The roll was dominated by cucumber.   Overall, come for the ramen and the special dishes. Order the staple somewhere else.",

Anyway I went with a couple of friends to find a new sushi spot and everyone always seem to rave about this place but after going here, I truly do not understand the hype. We waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged at our table, granted it was a little busy but still, 20 minutes is ridiculous. On top of that the sushi was expensive for the horrible quality of fish they dared serve me. I paid 11 for a basic roll and it came to me WARM, and the rest of the food was extremely mediocre. And at the end of the meal we waited a whopping 45 MINUTES FOR OUR CHECK AND WE HAD TO ASK FOR IF 3 TIMES! I would write more but this review would be endless but if you ask me, I would said just go to ginban across the street from this terrible place. Way better quality and way better price.

Food was good as usual but service was by far the worst we've EVER been treated!   When the 3 of us finished our meal we paid with 2 different credit cards.   When the receipt came back to us a gratuity was added.   We asked why was gratuity added and they said because they had to spilt up our checks with 2 different credit cards.  WTF... We never have this issue anywhere we go!   It wasn't worth the time to fight this since we had to get back to work anyway.    After the stupid gratuity issue...my coworker had leftovers to bring back, so he grabbed 2 chopsticks to go. One of the waitress saw him grab 2 so she grabbed 1 of the chopstick from his hands and told him that he only needed 1 chopstick!  WOW!  We were so shocked that we had nothing to say to her.    Bye bye Sushi Ken!!!  NEVER AGAIN WILL I OR MY COWORKERS BE BACK FOR YOUR RUDE SERVICE!!!!!",

I guess people have to visit more Sushi places in Phoenix, and then Arizona, and then West Coast......... that way you should be able to tell if it is really GOOD sushi or not.  I haven't mentioned East Coast or Asia yet, so yea.  Been there twice and found it deserves a review.. 1st time there- Just moved to Phoenix from Bay Area and was craving for some Sushi. A friend of mine heard me and took me there, saying it is the best sushi in the area. Ordered a sushi combo A or something. The price was good, considering the quality of sushi in the middle of dessert. I was drinking a bit and did not really remember too much, but I remembered it was good enough for me to go back.  2nd time- My girlfriend came to Phoenix for a visit, and we decided to go for sushi (again.) This time, however, was not so impressive. We ordered the sashimi combo, dynamite, saba nigiri and a few other nigiri. The miso soup was like instant soup, and the sashimi was REALLY NOT FRESH. It smells like it has been sitting the the fridge for ages, and we could not finish it. I don't mean to compare with the fishes I've had before, but it was just not acceptable.  General speaking, price is really good, so I will not complain too much. Especially the first time I went, the quality of food was acceptable. But I would not go back for another time, unless I know I am really craving for sushi and can't think of anywhere else.",

    "text": "WAY low prices, and very decent sushi.  They almost always have toro, which is a big plus in my book, and it's actually inexpensive in relation to other sushi places, which makes it even better.  Most importantly, the sushi has always been fresh.  I've never ordered off the regular menu, and I've always sat at the bar, so I can't speak to the service other than the sushi chef, and his service is consistently good.  This place consistently passes my \"tea test\" with flying colors (iced tea glass is refilled at 3/4 empty at a minimum, and never allowed to go dry).  The plating certainly isn't the most elegant or artistic, but the fish is fresh and tasty and the prices are low, so that offsets the visual appeal (or lack thereof).  If your usual idea of sushi is a place with sleek, modern decor, thumping music, expensive eats and lots of 20-somethings slamming sake bombers (can you say Ra?), this is not the place for you.  Sushi Ken is hidden behind some other buildings in a strip mall, and absolutely lacks ambiance.  Nonetheless, the fact that I have often been the only patron with round blue eyes lends credence to my opinion that the food is \"authentic\" (for whatever that's worth) and well-prepared.",

In my decades of existence and restaurant experiences, I've never heard of reservation gratuity.  Besides, when we arrived, the restaurant was not packed and plenty of tables (at 6pm).  The person on the phone did not mentioned anything about a charge to make reservation.  I've been to restaurants high and low and none has a reservation gratuity.  When we disputed this charge for a party of three, we were not presented with a manager.  May be all the wait people are managers of some sort.  We were told they do that all the time, but we were not told on the phone when making the reservation.  Shady and unprofessional way of doing business.  It's not going to happen again.

I tried a bit of my girlfriend's chicken she got and it was delicious. Anyone who likes Japanese food simply must visit this place, is it also great for first timers.

I even managed to get a group of 15 high school kids go to Sushi Ken for their homecoming dance dinner when I was in high school 6 years ago (which isn't a small feat, if you consider all the traditional high-school-dance-dinner-venues). Probably visited at least twice a week, when I lived in the Ahwatukee area.  ...What happened? It pains me to only give Sushi Ken a one-star rating, it really does, because half a decade ago I would have recommended them to the President of the United States. For some reason, not only has the food quality diminished in the past few years, the portions have undoubtedly shrunken, and the prices have inflated. Which still isn't the worst part.  I have absolutely nothing good to say about the service. No matter how good a restaurant's food is, if the service cant support the product, it's not worth eating at all.   Sushi Ken is not a friendly atmosphere. Water cups are never refilled. Food takes the entire Paleolithic era to be delivered. The servers used to be flexible with the menu and accommodated for substitution requests; however, now there is a ridiculous 20% upcharge to substitute salmon for tuna. The waitresses make you feel like they hate you and that they dread serving you, no matter how kind you are to them. Perhaps it's because they've implemented a 15% autogratuity policy, regardless of how large the party is, so they can get away with poor service without having to take a cut in profit. It's absolutely ridiculous. The queen of evil servers (the tallish Asian one who never smiles, only scowls), spilled water on my dad one time without so much as an apology. A few weeks later, as she was serving ramen to one of my girlfriends, she spilled half the broth on the tray and completely ignored her mistake.   So I thought I would find a way to bypass the horrible service while still enjoying a Sushi Ken lunch - call in for a takeout order and control my own service in the comfort of my home. I called in for a ramen, and requested that they separate the noodles from the broth in order to avoid them getting soggy (which is the standard for noodle packaging, right?) WRONG. Fifty cent up-charge. OUTRAGEOUS. Now, I get that you're trying to scrimp and save marginal costs, but really? Sacrificing the satisfaction and loyalty of a customer as well as food quality in order to save ONE to-go container that cost maybe fifteen cents max? Bad idea.     Come on, people, you're in the service industry. You're paid to serve. It's not that hard of a job - you smile and greet your patrons, who don't expect much in the first place - all they want is good food (which you have), and an atmosphere that doesn't make the table feel like their server's  going to pounce and maul their faces off.   News flash, Sushi Ken - tips are earned, not obligatory. I once served at a restaurant where autogratuity was forbidden, because management believed that excellent service speaks for itself. If you had to implement an autograt to every single party, big or small, then chances are you KNOW that your Service. Flat. Out. Sucks. People aren't happy to be treated like scum, then forced to pay for it. The solution is simple - revamp your service training protocol, and you'll get your loyal customers back.  To my fellow Yelpers: Avoid at all costs. I'm telling you, boycott this restaurant, and hopefully they'll shape up in the future. Because if not, there's no way Sushi Ken will stay alive in the long run.",

    "text": "OUR FAVORITE SUSHI IN TOWN!  If you want traditional Japanese cuisine, skip the fancy \"sushi\" bars and head to Sushi Ken.  We visit a few times a month.  You will find great service and an incredible menu. Their sashimi is to die for.  The hamachi is always fresh and buttery.  I can't say enough about their rolls.  They serve traditional cold and hot noodles, great bentos, Chirachi and even Korean Kalbi.  You will always find affordable combos.  They have a great selection of Japanese beers and sake.  Last time we were there the kids could barely finish their meal because the portions are so generous.  But they still had a second helping of miso because it is SO YUMMY!  Another thing to note, it is always packed with Oriental families.  That is always a good sign.  In the past year that we've been going there, we have never encountered any problems.  Thank you Sushi Ken!",
