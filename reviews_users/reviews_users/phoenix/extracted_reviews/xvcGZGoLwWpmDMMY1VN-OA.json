    "text": "Disclaimer: I was invited to come have lunch compliments of Thirsty Lion.   Upon arriving, we were greeted by the hostess who was very friendly.  She and another hostess debated on where to seat us - and the 1st hostess suggested a low top since my guest was quite short.  I'm glad she noticed. :)    Our server approached shortly after, and I am so mad I forgot her name, but she was courteous, friendly and knew her stuff.  We started off with the calamari and the bbq bacon wrapped prawns.  Both were delicious and the prawns were quite large and meaty.  Ashley, the event coordinator also stopped by to introduce herself - she was very friendly and knowledgeable about the restaurant and the menu.   For entrees, I ordered the pork cubano - I have to admit, this was my least favorite dish of the 3 that we ordered.  There were 2 types of meat in there and one of them was just not hitting my taste buds right. I actually couldn't finish it.  The fries that came with it were delicious though.  Perfectly crunchy.  Another person at our table ordered the filet mignon over mashed potatoes and asparagus.  The filet was perfectly cooked at medium rare and tasted divine.  The texture was great.  And the 3rd person at our table had the salmon risotto - that was hands down, the favorite of the table.  It was creamy and the salmon was cooked perfectly.  I'd definitely order that dish again.    For dessert, though full, our server suggested the blackberry cobbler with a scoop of ice cream on top.  It was great and the 3 of us shared it.  Without the sweetness of the ice cream, it would have been a bit tart, but with the ice cream, made it perfect.   Overall, our experience was wonderful.  Extremely friendly staff, food presentation was impressive and food was great (minus the cubano...sorry!).    Thank you for having us and we will definitely be back to try out other menu items.",

I think the happy hour food is yummy - especially the chicken fingers. And the drinks are priced fair enough.  My ONLY negative experience was last weekend before a movie and they were super slow and we nearly were late to the movie - completely missing out on part of our order.  It was a communication issue I am sure, but we had to chase them down to address it and that was concerning that they never checked in our table or asked us for another round of drinks.  HOWEVER - as we walked out, the manager chased us down and apologized and offered us a free appetizer when we come back. HUGE  That kind of customer service means we'll be back.  Thanks Thirsty Lion!",

    "text": "I ordered a breakfast with sausage. When the breakfast came out, the sausage wasn't sausage, it was hamburger from the sliders. Also, two of the three, over easy eggs were broke and over hard, plus the potatoes were cold. I told the waitress, that wasn't sausage it was hamburger. She had them make two more sausages for me. When they came out, it was hamburger again. I asked if this is how the sausage is here, can I just have bacon. She went back to order the bacon. Then the manager came over, I pleaded with him to taste the sausage, he went out of sight and did. Then he realized the cooks were using the sliders as sausage. Apparently the Cook's can't tell the difference by looking at it. He then said he was going to make me the sausage that came with the meal, bacon order canceled. Please understand I eat the sausage last with my breakfast. So I was waiting for a very long time, For my sausage. The fourth go round, I gave up, and just left. Believe it or not, they didn't put a big rush on making the sausage when I told them it was hamburger, all three go backs. So I waited well past half an hour, Probably closer to an hour. And left, before I got my sausage after four attempts. It was a very silly day. Last week, I ordered the same and they brought bacon. When I said I ordered sausage, the waitress started to take my whole plate back to the kitchen. I had to tell her leave the plate with me. Otherwise everything on it gets cold, while I wait for the sausage. That day they brought the sausage on only the second request. You can't make this up, I swear to God it's True.",

Hubby had the pork tenderloin special with cherry sauce that he liked. Friends had smoked chick salad and Cobb salad they said were good. The reasons I didn't give it a 5* is because the service was very poor. First the restaurants more than 1/2 empty but we were told a 20\" wait. Said we could wait at one of the bars but there's was not bartender at one of the bars. Then all the food came and we had to ask 3x's to get the dressing for one of the salads. I asked what the 2nd dressing was they gave me for my salad and never did get an answer. The manager (I assume) came and asked how things were but was in such a hurry he didn't wait for an answer. Finally did flag him down for a glass of water that had been asked for before.",

Food- Meh, it's a Gastropub but we hit happy hour so the plates they had were a great deal. The food was okay maybe 3 and a half stars. Nothing great and nothing bad, with the exception of the chili cheddar potato cakes. I loved those! The sliders were good inside but the bread was either too hard or over toasted, I prefer the roll softer. The Calamari was okay but not the best I have ever had by a long shot. I liked the sauce that came with it. The St. Patty's Day themed Whiskey bread Pudding was good. We demolished that. Again, not the best I have had but this is not a five star, chef restaurant.   I say go. It is a nice place. The happy hour deals are great and the food is good. The place was crowded when we went and they were short staffed but we still got good service.",

There were 5 of us total and we tried the brussels sprouts appetizer as well as the pretzel with amber ale fondue to start.  The brussels sprouts were surprisingly good, cooked with a little bit of bacon (which makes almost anything better).  The pretzel itself was ok - nothing too exciting.  The fondue was too much beer, not enough cheese.  Stick with cheese fondue for pretzels, people!  Entrees...  I had the french dip.  Others had the chicken caprese sandwich and fish and chips.  All were decent.  I do not like the dip for the french dip.  It has rosemary in it and it just tasted like an herb juice, which I did not enjoy.  The sandwich itself was quite tasty.  The fish and chips were decent, perhaps a bit too much breading.  The chicken caprese sandwich was very good.  Now for the best part - dessert!  Where the dip for the pretzels tasted like beer, the black butte brownie is not overpowered by beer.  It was delicious!  The blackberry cobbler was also very tasty but oh so mushy.  Other notes:  Our server was great - very friendly, made great recommendations, and kept our beverages full.  They make their own lemonade here and it was pretty good.  The restaurant itself gets an A+ for atmosphere.  Every part of the restaurant looks awesome, including the restrooms.  I would definitely recommend coming here.  The menu has a huge variety of items (almost too much) and I look forward to trying something new on a future visit!",

For our main course, we shared the Romano herb crusted chicken with lemon-herb beurre blanc and capers, over creamy garlic noodles, accompanied by sauteed green beans and red bell peppers, and fresh dill.   Stephanie was our waitress, and she was just a perfect representative of Thirsty Lion. She was friendly, attentive, and responsive to our needs even before we told her. She already knew from paying close attention. We also had two highly positive contacts with the manager during our meal, and we were quite impressed with his hands-on management style.

Our waiter gave the impression he wasn't thrilled we had brought our kids (even though they love to eat out and are extremely well behaved) but the service he provided was still very good. The food was delicious.  They have a fairly large menu and it was hard for this foodie to decide what to order.  I ended up with the veggie panino which was a pesto lovers delight (yep, that's me!).  My hubby got the cubano sandwich and he liked it but said it was a bit too spicy.  That is saying something cause he loves spicy food.  Could have just been those particular jalapenos but he ended up taking them off (which shocked me to no end) cause it was giving him heartburn.  Kids meals were very good as well.  Fries are salty and delicious!  Overall we were happy with our meal and will return.  They also have a seasonal menu that changes.  I always like to see that.",

Dinner was good, one of our friends had to leave and his tab was rung up, however, Carlos disappeared nowhere to be found for at LEAST 30 minutes after so we had to find another server so we could pay our tab.

The menu is a little pricey to me, but for a once in awhile treat its not bad. My brother-in-law had a pasta dish that was out of sight! So I truly believe you can't go wrong with what you order on this menu. There are some items I really want to try when I go back. The atmosphere is casual upscale and its a little dark inside but they also have outdoor seating if that bothers you. When we went it was raining and I liked being inside haha I thought it was a nice environment. Our server was friendly and when asked told us her recommendations, but also clarified that she is vegetarian so she couldn't comment on the meat with some dishes. She did eat fish though and said their sushi was her favorite and very popular. It was a good choice! She always kept our drinks filled as well. Thanks! :)",

Cassy had the seared ahi tuna and I am not a huge fan of tina however this time I tried it and it was outstanding!   I had the sausage and prosciutto Flatbread and it was great as well.  I liked the melding of flavors of the prosciutto with the sliced pepperacini and goat cheese and sausage.  The only minor issue could be that the prosciutto was overpowered by the rest of the toppings.  The crust was nicely done and crunchy.  We'll be back for their bacon wrapped prawns and their outstanding happy hour specials.  We've found a new place!  You should definitely try it!",

The Fish n' Chips were weird and not very tasty with some bizarre IPA beer batter... making them dark/bitter/heavy.  Service was not attentive and there were not many people there.",

Our server was great and went out of his way to make sure we had boxes at the end and then made sure we ordered food before the \"kitchen closed at 10\". Usually, when a kitchen closes at 10 you can assume that the place stays open another hour after that. We put our food in at 9:55 thinking we had an hour to eat and finish our glasses of wine. But a female (small, blonde) came over and picked up the checks, right before 11, for her co-worker and told us that \"they had been closed for an hour and they wanted to leave so we should finish up and get out of here\"... VERY rudely. I am a server at two high service standards restaurants and know how to treat a guest. I am astonished at the way she spoke to us. NO ONE said they closed at 10. Our server said last call for food was at 10! So this makes no sense. And I get it, you want to leave... but say hey by the way we are closed now so take your time to finish your wine. We couldn't even finish and had to run out cause we were so uncomfortable. Never been treated so horrible by server. Will not be returning to this location.",

The hostess/bus guy opened the drawer in front of entrance where they keep coasters and crayons that's where the rag was. I used to worked in high end restaurant and small owned restaurants as a hostess/bus girl and that's not where you keep a rag when you clean tables all the time.

He was amazing and basically met our every need making for excellent friendly service; I tip my lady hat to you sir.   For starters we ordered the calamari. This dish was not for us, tho we were told many others adore it. Maybe we're not use to the fancy calamari, apparently we enjoy the poor mans version of fried and fried some more. It was a bit tough to chew, and pretty funky, of course we ate it all.   Michael suggested the smoked turkey club so I threw all caution to the wind and ordered that bad boy. Um it was amazing! It had pepper smoked turkey, maple wood bacon, a chipotle drizzle on some amazingly rustic soft and perfectly toasted bread.  (FYI I'm a bead person...I, love, bread.)  It came with a side of fries that were delish as well.  Ikr course I couldn't tell you what my friend ordered because I had my face buried in my own plate.   Overall it was a good leisurely catch up brunchy kinda meal with a beautiful friend; warm tummies and a warm heart. It was one of days you always remember and go back to in your head and smile.   We will always have the Thirsty Lion, oh yes we will.",

    "text": "I ate here on Labor Day Sept 4, 2017 for first time ever, due to $15 for $30 Groupon going to expire.  I already selected the 12 oz ribeye for $29.95 to be my $30 item before purchasing the voucher.  When I ordered the ribeye off the menu which the server specified just the way I would say it, but he spoke first \"mediumrare/rare.  I said I just want to make sure it is red on the inside but not raw so it is hard to chew.  When it already arrived, my server told me that my ribeye only cost $23.95 and I must order more to make $30, so perhaps I would like to pick an appetizer.  WOW, really?   He told me that the rib eye WAS $23.95 about a month ago, but the menu changed and prices increased due to the $10 minimum wage law.   I told him that I SAW that the ribeye was $29.95 on the website menu AND on the menu he just took away.  He went away.  The ribeye looked the way I wanted it when I first cut into it, but later, I saw the rest of it was medium instead of mediumrare/rare.  The server came back twice to check on me, but I did not say anything to the server about it being medium, because I didn't want the cow to be wasted as they would throw away what I send back.  I got to thinking that $23.95 to $29.95 was a huge price increase for $10 minimum wage.  Later a woman came to talk to me.  She was the manager.  She told me that he got the price mixed up with the sirloin that was $24.95, and that they did not have a price change this year, the ribeye was always $29.95.   I held the steak up to her, and showed her the inside.  I asked what would she label the way it looked.   She said medium/medium rare.  I said I wanted medium rare/rare, red on the inside, not pink.  'But I am not sending it back because I hate to waste\".  She did not offer any words of remedy.    I just ate at Fogo de Chaos last Thursday, and I wrote in my Yelp review, that I could see how red the meat was, and say I want THAT red part, and that most of the time in other restaurants, I just settle for what comes out of the kitchen, it is rarely \"just right\".  This is one of those situations.    Steak was served with asparagus which was fibrous (spit it out), even towards the upper half.  Mashed potatoes was good, but not more than a 'B\".  I ate here a second time, about a month later, ordered the same steak, which I said I want it RED on the inside.  It was served to me WELL DONE!   Not even pink on the inside, which the server acknowledged and agreed fully and took the steak back. Server said I TOLD the cook to make it rare!!!!  It took a long time before I got another steak, but this time, was cooked to my satisfaction.    When I got my bill, unlike the first time, it came with a \"comment card\".  Well I started writing and writing and writing !  I guess the manager (a man this time, not the woman who visited me before) was watching me write on that comment card!   He came over, said he was the manager, and asked me if there was anything he could do for me, and if everything was OK.  I told him all the above story.    Well he gave me a $20 gift card, which I have not yet used.  All this was last year but I am not changing my 2 star story because of the gift card.  Someday I will use it and hopefully have a better experience with the steak.  The steak itself, when cooked right (red on the inside) is quite Yummy!  .",

Not a lot of choices, but more than any other place we've been in a week and a half. My stomach thanks you.",

We also ordered the kung pao which was pretty good.  The manager was walking around checking on tables and the service was efficient. For the portion sizes I don't think the prices are too bad.

I got the Gilled Atlantic Salmon which was EXCELLENT! My date got the pulled pork sandwich, also EXCELLENT. Their fries are good too! What surprised us most was that i assumed since my meal was 20.00 and his was 14.00, that we'd get the lesser meal free with our coupon. Nope, they actually gave my 20.00 entree. They also brought us a desert. That was also very smart of them because it was DELICIOUS, and I'd totally go there for the desert.

Generally cobbs are pretty hard to mess up- just throw some egg, avocado, bacon, and tomatoes on and you've got a great salad!

A sweet, peppy server kept me happy with tea refills while we ate fried calamari, a California roll, and garlic edamame.  While none of those food items are particularly thrilling on their own, they were well executed, delivered to our table in a timely manner, and we got out of the restaurant full with having spent less than $25. The breading on the calamari was especially yummy and not too heavy, complementing the calamari well.  Happy hour prices are very reasonable -- many items for around $5 -- while their regular menu varies greatly in cost. Digs are what can be expected from a chain restaurant in a mall -- clean, but a little boring.",

The burger was probably the better item of the bunch.  The fries were limp and soft.    Don't get me started on pub that doesn't even offer wings.

Asked again for red sauce and after a long wait our waitress came back with cocktail sauce. Explained to her that we wanted marinara sauce (Isn't that what usually comes with calamari?) After another long wait she returned with a cup of ice cold marinara sauce. By this time the calamari was cold too. When I ordered my entree I specifically asked if the \"southwest grilled chicken \" in the salad was at all spicy and the waitress said no. After a few bites my mouth felt like it was on fire. When I told the waitress that the chicken was spicy she said that she didn't think it was but they cook it with peppers so that could make it spicy. Wish she had said that when I ordered it. Then she took my plate away and didn't even ask if I wanted anything else instead. A few minutes later she brought us the check without even asking if we wanted dessert. Really expected more from a restaurant with a 4 star rating on Yelp.",

We had the pretzel to share and it stayed soft the whole time, which I admit was not long because it was so good! I had a salad for lunch, and it was fresh and flavorful. I had a bite of my husband's panini and it was full of meat and very hearty. The decor is interesting, kind of piece-mealed together, but whatever. We still had a great time and the service was good, too.",

I didn't even know that there was a new restaurant here so it was fun to try something different.  I was not impressed when we first walked in. The hostess was so rude and would not look us in the eye or even respond to our request for a table.  She was acting like we were bothering her when we asked how log they had been open for. If it weren't for my family and I being so thirsty we probably would have walked out then.  Once we were seated however things were great.  Our waitress was awesome, and we ordered the Brussel sprout salad and the Mexican chicken salad.  Both were delicious and refreshing for lunch. They also were perfect size. Nothing crazy were you were stuck with leftovers, but enough so that we were full.  My sister ordered the caprese sandwich and said it was pretty good, nothing special.    Overall we had a good meal, but I would recommend the hostess be a little more friendly, first impressions are everything.",

So far so good.  Issues so far: we were seated in a corner right under a huge flatscreen tv. Epileptics would be thrashing around on the floor from the flashing and scene changing on the tv. There should never be a tv this close to a seat.  The music is awful droning Strip club rock. Why? How appetizing is a headache? Hopefully the food is better than the environment.  We ordered fish tacos and a sirloin steak.   Talk amongst yourselves while we wait.  The music has become more jarring if that is possible.the food is just ok Not great but mediocre enough to eat  Not a repeat destination",

    "text": "HUGE fan of this place!! I really like their newer location at Scottsdale Fashion Square because it's right by their new Camelview Theaters which make a great dinner & movie date option. Thirsty Lion is also the right place to catch some sports as they have nice flatscreen's throughout the restaurant.   My boyfriend and I started off with the Ultimate Chicken Nachos and ultimate is the best descriptor. Somehow they've made the chicken to taste almost chorizo-like and full of flavor. The chipotle aioli makes the dish for me, as it's drizzled all over the final creation and makes every bit extra awesome. Honestly we probably could have ended our dinner just after splitting that because it was plenty of food but alas, we each ordered an entree.  Well I guess mine was technically not an entree because it came from the appetizer menu but nonetheless I ate it like an entree; I ordered the Pulled Pork Sliders. They are super yummy if you're a pulled pork fan like myself. Three of them come on a plate and topped with Napa slaw (aka coleslaw) and garlic aioli. If I didn't eat a huge plate of nachos just before, I would have ordered a side of fries to go with them. Zach ordered the Roasted Pork Cubano which is marked on their menu as a Thirsty Lion Signature Item. I got to try a bite and it was really delicious and packed with flavor. Hand cut fries come as a side with the sandwich and those a great too.   Lastly, if you go to the Scottsdale Fashion Square location, make sure to ask for Patrick as your server. He's attentive, gives good food ordering advice (like to order the Ultimate Nachos), and is a super sweet guy. The rest of the staff is friendly too, you really can't go wrong. They have awesome happy hours deals too!",

Upon arrival the hostess said he would be back with some waters. 5 minutes past and a lady comes to our table and tells us, \"I'm not your server but I will take your order because your server is currently backed up\", keep in mind, still no waters. We tell her our orders having ordered 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, and an entree. A man (manager) comes up to our table 10 minutes later and delivers the appetizers and drinks. We asked for a side of plates and another set of silverware since there was only 1 on the table and he says he will be back with them. My friend gets upset and goes inside to find someone who can get us some plates and silverware being we are starving and having no plates to eat with, also 10 minutes had passed! Our server asks if we want the entree cut in half and my friend says no. 1 second later the man behind him brings the entree. (What is the point in asking when the food is already here????) no one comes to check on us after the food arrives. The fries that came with the entree were the leftover pieces that you can tell were old. The food was cold.",

The guy rudely said, \"I don't think the busses will leave without you.\" Our server was Mark C. When we got our food, I tried it before I left. Most of my food was cold and felt like it had been sitting. After working in food service for most of my high school and college career, they aren't doing it right. Use trays. Servers shouldn't weave between tables. Bring food out together in an organized fashion. I watched an entire half of a Barclays Premier League Soccer match waiting for my food. I watched servers look at the food ready to go baffled as it sits on the counter ready to go.   The atmosphere is great. If they fix the service, then they will have something here, but until then.

    "text": "The best thing this place has to offer is the Monday Special (full sized pizza and 2 soft drinks for $20), where you get 2 good for anything/time Harkins (and any location) movie passes. Otherwise, I would never come back here for the food.  We came here with my mom for a bite to eat and she wanted to try someplace new. It was a Monday and it was around 4pm with a few people scattered throughout the restaurant. The second star is for whom I would assume was the manager who seated us, got us set up with menus and was very nice. The Monday deal is also worth its own star.  IF this business reads reviews, please note that sometimes it is ok for your waitstaff to write things down so that food is delivered as ordered.  Beer Cheese soup that husband ordered as a starter arrived with his pizza and was broken and not smooth. The fish and chips my mom ordered was overcooked and dry and my happy hour sized pizza was undercooked and not edible. Food was subpar for the most part but the husband liked his pizza enough.   I would also make sure that your long haired waitresses, tie their hair back a bit so that hair does not end up on the outside of a glass or in food and that your hostesses don't just stand around playing with or stroking their hair extensions. Service pretty much sucked, but we knew we wouldn't be coming back.  So, if you do decide to come- it might be to your taste as everything is subjective. Just as a note, an adult ticket at Harkin's for a nighttime movie is $10 (way less than theaters in the Bay Area) and the Monday special where you get two movie tickets for a $20 pizza that is large enough to share and 2 sodas is a steal of a deal.",

When it shut down, I was disappinted because usually the next restaurant is not as good. Well this didn't happen. Thirsty Lion is better! First - the staff is awesome. Bartenders get to know your name if you are a regular. Wait staff are very friendly. Prices are average Scottsdale 4 star joints- compares to Houstons, Roaring Fork, Don & Charlie's, PF Changs. Great atmosphere, lots of TV screens with sports, fine music. A word to people who knock any place for slow service. Keep in mind that any restaurant can have a crash of customers all at one time. Slow service once should never be a reason to write (or take seriously) two star ratings. Last - the food is excellent for what could be described as a classy, polished sports bar. My favorites - the short rib and steak dinners, fish tacos, spicy fried chicken sliders, burgers, all the salads. Only improvement could be in their happy hour. Just doesn't compare to the best in the area. But it's not bad and if you want things fast, that's the time to sit at the bar or a high top and enjoy great food and drinks.",

I really liked that although I was seated in the main restaurant dining area, I did not hear the trivia being played in the bar.

And of course the management is quick to defend, stating \"Arizona is very tough on liquor laws\" like okay he's 30, and his ID looks more like him than mine looks like me. I have my certifications also so don't give me the bullshit (btw, I usually don't even get carded at this establishment) but that's fine, a business that doesn't want money is a business I'd rather not contribute to.  Was an almost daily visitor to thirsty lion working walking distance away but based on the way my friend was made out to be a liar and then promptly ignored, its safe to say I'll happily take my money other places (like the 3 other bars that accepted his ID, such as Yard House, who brought out a book to verify the validity)",

Hands down perhaps the best vegetarian burgers we have ever had. They were huge and deliciously messy to eat. The fries were a bit over-salted and conflicted with the flavor of the burger. Next time I may try the cole slaw or salad instead.  Table service was great also. These was never a moment our drinks weren't refreshed. A+ for food and A+ to Patrick for the service.   THE BAD: On arrival we were \"greeted\" by a handful of hostess type \"kids.\" None of them had name tags or a recognizable brand outfit so you assumed they were the hostesses. I say \"greeted\" when we walked in, aside of a blank stare and a \"how many\" look, we were not acknowledged. A male host took us to a table. One side of the table was facing the glaring sun and when I asked if we could have a different table, he actually said \"whatever.\" It was obvious that the hosts need to be trained in hospitality.   Was it not for the food and the great table service I would probably never return.",

I have generally been disappointed by nachos at restaurants lately. Usually just a bag of chips with just a few toppings tossed on before heating. I was glad to find this pub style restaurant makes them the way they should be. Every chip with at least some delicious topping on it. We split the entree, a grilled salmon and asparagus risotto. It was delicious. They kindly split it into two plates. It was devoured quickly. In general this place has a great English pub feel. However, I still prefer the one at Tempe Marketplace just a few miles away. This is a great place for a lunch or early dinner while shopping at the state's top mall. It will also be great when the new Harkin's Theater opens a few hundred yards away. But, when looking for that destination dinner the stand-alone Tempe location is my preferred choice.",

The meat on the French Dip tasted like it had expired.  Fish n Chips was a small portion atop of a stack of french fries.  This tasted like a McDonald's Fish sandwhich. The french fries looked great, but had no flavor.  Personally, I think they have WAY too much on their menu to put enough effort into a few good menu items to do well. Slow service. We never complained.  A manager came over to talk with us and thanked me for the feedback and said, \"we have something to offer to everyone, so hopefully you can find something you like next time. \"  I was not looking for any deductions on our bill, however, he should have tried to at least give us a coupon for another try.  Although, even then I would not return.  Airport food is way better!",

    "text": "THIRSTY LION-- I love to write good reviews, unfortunately sometimes I have to write a less than favorable one. Sadly this review is long overdue. Was hoping they would improve so I wouldn't have to write a bad one. --First, I will say, we frequent this place only because it's the only restaurant close to the theater. We are always hoping for good food and service, but are always underwhelmed. This time was no exception. Cobb salad was literally the size of a side salad (on their side salad sized plate), but the price of a large cobb salad that you could get anywhere else. Waiter said that the greens were a romain blend. Came out with very little greens and no romain. Don't even know how they can call it a salad. Very few greens, not like a typical salad. And the cheap, fluffy, mixed greens...but with no \"fluff\", not fresh. Had some teeny, tiny pieces of hard chicken and some blue cheese crumbles, etc. Everything was very finely chopped like they were trying to hide the fact that it was not fresh, nor good quality. Dressing wasn't good, very heavy blue cheese vinaigrette that did not taste fresh. So, not loving that, we thought we would order some nachos. Surely you can't get nachos wrong. Nachos arrived and looked so good, but were not. Again, gross, hard, tiny pieces of chicken and some weird sour cream blend that we couldn't figure out. We asked for a couple sides of salsa thinking that might make it better. Salsa arrived and looked awesome, so we poured it all over the nachos, only to find that it was bad. Not just bad, but fermented, sparkling, fizzy, old, gross. We told the waiter and he had the chefs try it. They agreed it was fermented and threw it all out. I understand this can happen sometimes, but it seems to go hand in hand with the quality of food that we have become used to here. We've tried one of everything it seems. Nothing great. California Roll is prob the best thing on menu, but takes FOREVER (maybe only one chef knows how to prepare?) and has just a speckle of avo so they can say they put it in. Really want to like this place. Given it so many tries. Our waiter, although not super knowledgable of the menu, took good care of us. I would give him a shout out, but don't want to associate him with this poor review. Sorry Thirsty Lion. Please let us know when you make some healthy changes. We would love to see your restaurant improve. I will give two stars instead of one, because of wait staff...not always the quickest or sharpest...but always kind and sincere.",

    "text": "I just wanted to let you know about our experience Saturday evening at your Scottsdale Fashion Square location. When our food came one of the food runners dropped a ramekin of ketchup on the floor that splattered all over my family. Pretty crappy but, accidents happen. But then nobody apologized or even said anything. This isn't something that was unnoticed as ketchup was on one of my kids face. We asked for extra napkins, which never came. Our appetizer plate and all side plates sat on the table the entire meal, even our dinner plates remained on the table as we paid the bill. An honest review of the food was maybe a 4 out of 10. Your restaurant completely failed to provide any sort of dining experience at all. You food & service was below what I could expect from the Food Court in the mall. I really don't want to have to complain to a manager while I'm out, I just don't go back. I truly wish everyone great success but I would be TRULY AMAZED if your organization lasted a year in Scottdale.  Best,",

I had a beet salad with arugula and chicken. $13.95 and it was pretty small with not much chicken. Did I leave hungry? No. But when I spend that much on a salad I expect a bit more. Another person in my party had the Cuban sandwich and it was pretty good. Not a traditional Cuban sandwich but tasty nonetheless.  The kids meal was $6.95 and didn't include a drink. It was a good sized portion however and my daughter liked it. It wasn't crowded but we had to wait awhile for our drinks from the bar and we had to request water refills and silverware setup. The server was nice but overall service was just spotty.",

Since it was happy hour, let's start with the drink, if any one knows me they know Moscow Mules are my go to drink but Thirsty Lion kicked up a notch with their Spicy Mule, Smirnoff Vodka, ginger beer, lime juice, simple syrup, lime wedge and freshly sliced jalapenos, oh man this drink was amazing! Loved it! If you don't like spicy things, stay away from the Spicy Mule, because those jalapenos, they get all infused in the drink, so dang good!  Now for the food:  Pulled Pork Sliders, Traditional Scotch Egg, Sauteed Brussels Sprouts,  Bacon Wrapped BBQ Prawns, Bacon Wrapped Dates, who doesn't love BACON!!!!     Pulled Pork Sliders were great and since it was up for the offering I tried a Scotch egg, a hardboiled egg wrapped in pork sausage lightly breaded & fried, can't say I would order them again, but not saying I didn't like them, it was a little bland for me, and honestly I'm not a fan of sausage (but love me some bacon!!). The bacon wrapped bbq prawns, oh my gosh! Yum!! oh and the sauteed Brussels sprouts, oh my! They were sauteed with pepper bacon, red onions, olive oil & Reggiano Cheese, these are the way Brussels Sprouts should always be! I was tickled pinked to see the bacon wrapped dates because I had been craving them!!  They were medjool dates stuffed with Gorgonzola cheese & almonds wrapped in maple pepper bacon, these guys are just heavenly!! I could make a dinner out of them. Ok not really, but you really should try them!   Happy to have tried Thirsty Lion out for Happy Hour, look forward to coming back!",

Excellent food and superb service are tough to come by at restaurants as big as the Thirsty Lion.  But they somehow, against the odds, provide both.

All I had to do was send an email stating the day/time my party wanted to show, along with the Elites in my party, and they would provide us with a comped meal, including apps and desserts!  Parking wasn't too bad, in their ample lot, and was only a short walk to the front door.  Once inside, Tom D greeted us with a smile and a hearty handshake.  The interior was spacious, so I took a stroll to survey the estate.  This location includes a delightful patio area.  We were led to a reserved high-top table in the bar area.  Yes, they were expecting us.  It was about this time that our 4th, Kazi, arrived.  We hugged, we laughed, we looked at the menu.  Since the apps were on the house, I had to go with the Sesame Seared Ahi Tuna, since J decided on the Bacon Wrapped Dates.  My Ahi couldn't have been more perfect.  It was as good as I've ever had anywhere else.  And I shared my wares with the whole table.  For my entree, I had to try the Grilled Atlantic Salmon.  Once again, the fish was perfectly prepared.  At $21, it may be a tad expensive, and generous, for a lunch, unless you're sporting quite the noontime appetite, as it came with a mound of white cheddar mash and al dente green beans.  My friends and I were treated exceptionally well by the staff here.  It's quite a ways away from my home and office, but I would absolutely return if in the area.  Thank you Thirsty Lion management and staff",

    "text": "#300:  After going back and forth between 4 or 5 stars, I've settled with 5 but it's probably closer to 4.5 if I were to be honest ---- 4 for food, 5 for service, ambiance, and overall experience.  Plus, I had a lovely complimentary VIP Yelp Elite meal with the best group of friends ever!  Be jealous because they're pretty awesome.  \"Good food is all the sweeter when shared with good friends.\"  Heck should I know but #truth!  It was a sunny Friday in classy Scottsdale when I walked in.  The blue-eyed gentleman, my personal Mister Luck, Tom D. met up with us from the bar.  We were 15 minutes late but Kazi H. was even more late as always but she's a hottie so it's okay.  Anyways, after being led to our table where we were graciously informed that purse hooks were available under the table, we sat down and paid no attention to the menu.  We're terrible people like that.  But really, who sits down at a restaurant to order food when there's much hugging and bantering to be had?  Patrick, our server who we renamed as Patrique, had the patience of a saint.  We were indecisive, a bit ADHD, and all our dietary habits and quirks made sharing difficult.  Let's face it, we all want to share to try more of the menu right?  Tomcat bought us some drinks, that cheeky sweet guy, and soon Kazi and I were guzzling her not-so-great Blood Orange Cosmo and my amazing Grapefruit & Basil Martini.  What a great Friday!  We had ordered Bacon Wrapped Dates, Shrimp Ceviche, Seared Ahi Tuna appetizer, Seared Ahi Entree Salad, Chicken Penne & Gorgonzola Cream, Grilled Sirloin Steak, Grilled Atlantic Salmon, and the creme brulee [because if you know Kazi and me, we can't resist brulee!].  I won't bore you with all the details but portions were plenty and I would say out of the eight things ordered, I think we really enjoyed six of them.  The two not enjoyed as much came from the same person who ordered the blah Cosmo *cough*Kazi*cough*.    Notes:  Those bacon wrapped dates were sooo good.  Truly a flavor explosion, had lots of interesting textures, and probably my favorite bite of the day!  Between the saintly gentleman and all his good Catholic no-meat Friday, my YFF who has given up sugar, and my Kazi-love who doesn't eat pork, I was scared that I ended up ordering a whole appetizer by myself but they stepped up to be True friends by splitting two dates between the three of them despite their food restrictions.  These guys... it's love!  Also to note, I think the brulee had good flavor but please put the torch on it longer.  I love breaking a crispy caramelized shell.  I was a sad panda when my spoon just sunk into it as if it were pudding.  :(  Easily fixable though so keep doing what you're doing!  Anyways, lunch was amazing.  Great service, gorgeous restaurant, and even the restrooms were nice!  Had I had Kazi in there with me, much selfies could have been had.  Thank you, Thirsty Lion, for allowing us four to come in for a wonderful meal!",

    "text": "Met three friends here for VIP lunch (everything except alcohol was comped).  Service was OK (a little hiccup when server told us there was a limit of only ONE app, ONE entree, and ONE dessert & went to ask his manager when we asked him to confirm), but he came back apologizing about his mistake & told us we could order what we wanted, excluding alcohol.  Which brings me to bring up something that I thought was common sense-- if a place comps you something, then please make sure you tip your server!  If a place comps you EVERYTHING you've ordered (sodas, $10 apps, $15 salads and $13+ entrees; filet mignon was $29, AND $5+ desserts), then PLEASE tip 20%!  My four-item meal came to $56 before taxes, so I tipped our server $13 for my portion... The best part of this FREE multi-course lunch was that the food was very good!!  Well, what I had ordered anyway.  Bacon-Wrapped Dates- stuffed  w/ gorgonzola-cream cheese filling and wrapped in bacon.  There were chopped almonds inside, which added another layer of texture to the luscious chewy, yet creamy date and sweet and tangy gorgonzola cream cheese!  The salty-sweet combo was truly delectable & was the runaway winner of all the apps we ordered!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=1biMeepfC8QkBNV_einnWA#1biMeepfC8QkBNV_einnWA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thir...</a>  Spicy mac 'n cheese- macaroni pasta w/ spicy Italian sausage, four cheeses (jack, cheddar, Swiss, parmesan), chipotle cream, red bell pepper, & scallions.  First few bites were dry and not tender enough, & we all wrote that off as a loss, until someone dug into the center and found the sweet spot!  SO, if you order this app, be sure to stir it well to distribute the cheesy-melted-goodness all throughout the bowl! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=Iuvrpz6K8-_uQi1oF16gpQ#Iuvrpz6K8-_uQi1oF16gpQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thir...</a>  Filet Mignon- wrapped in peppered bacon & then grilled w/ roasted garlic herb butter.  The steak was placed on a bed of delicious cheddar mashed potatoes & garnished w/ five grilled asparagus.  Cooked medium & was PERFECT!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=_opL4TOUoywHlkkL7t1KrQ#_opL4TOUoywHlkkL7t1KrQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thir...</a>  I would pay $29 & order this entree again!

Creme brulee!  Perfect crisped sugar topping and luscious creamy custard underneath.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=XD4Kd5hmVoX259bCPfUeSA#XD4Kd5hmVoX259bCPfUeSA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thir...</a>  Friends ordered the following...  Charcuterie- came w/ four meats, one pate, a fig jam, ONE blue cheese (funny that there was only one cheese featured), crostini, cornichons, & a grainy mustard.  I only enjoyed the crostini, jam, & cheese.  Didn't care for the pate, nor the Italian sausage... <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=mZuFr6QkCLZnv5j_4_Eucg#mZuFr6QkCLZnv5j_4_Eucg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thir...</a>  Traditional Scotch Eggs- My first time trying these, & I enjoyed the textures!  Crispy-fried battered \"shell\" and perfectly-cooked hard-boiled eggs that were wrapped with thin-sliced pork.  Interesting & delicious, but I'd rather have a few more of those bacon-wrapped dates!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/thirsty-lion-gastropub-and-grill-scottsdale-2?select=vz6suZx9sUkNKZ_ZoMtB0A#vz6suZx9sUkNKZ_ZoMtB0A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/thir...</a>  Sauteed Brussels Sprouts- simple, & provided a great helping of veggies!

The BBQ pork slider which was the best in town is no longer served. I ordered the pizza which was soggy and not that good. My friend ordered the pretzel which was completely different.  The dough is not the same and the dipping sauce was thinner. Beef sliders also changed.  They are now quite a bit smaller I guess this will be our last trip to this restaurant.  It was good while it lasted.  Why change a good thing?",

But our last visit, all three of our side salad either had too much dressing that you couldn't taste anything afterwards or hardly any dressing that it's best to just add to Burger since it lacked flavor of any kind. The Impossible meat was overcooked and very dry. Also, our server wasn't the best. Probably since we only ordered water with lemon, suddenly, we don't deserve his attention.  He should know that Vegans don't typically order sugary drinks or alcohol with their food.  At their price point on Impossible Burger, I get more value going at Cheesecake Factory since it tastes better and it's a generous portion of goodness for only a $1 more. Needless to say, we won't be coming back here anymore. And we won't be suggesting this place to family and friends who come to town. The service has gone down since the first time we came in to try this place.",

There are plenty of screens to watch but at the same time, they are not so many that they are over whelming. With the dark wood interior and the low lighting, it still feels like an English pub. The menu is quite large and varied to satisfy all tastes.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna Poke Bowl. It was very good with large pieces of tuna and was so large I could not finish it. The beer selection has both local and nationally known favorites.",

Our overall impression of the restaurant from aesthetics; beverage program; multitude of food and price options and sense of organization was \"Wow! This place was done right.\" We elected to sit at the posh looking bar and were quickly greeted by the female bartender (sleeved tattoo collage/\"Jacklynn\"?) on duty. We ordered 2 Happy Hour specials+the bison burger and were satisfied with the meal. During the return trip to our parked vehicle my friend, who is a female bartender herself, raved about how engaging \"Jacklynn\" was and pointed out that quality bartenders like her cultivate return customers by creating a fun, casual vibe.",

Staff was friendly however once I received my food, my disappointment quickly outweighed my original feel good impression.   Started with a spicy tuna app. Well presented, the tuna was not mixed missing the classic \"spicy\" taste you lol for. Setting that aside, within each bite your struggling to taste the fish with the overpowering taste of rice which is double the needed amount to make up for an obvious lack of tuna. At nearly double the price of most other restaurants, an $11 app quickly sets up the wrong tone.   My main course was the \"Spicy Shrimp Ceviche\" ... although fresh, a massive disappointment came over me as I realized that my $12 lunch was nothing but a 4-6 oz cup of maybe 4-5 jumbo shrimp, obviously pouched and not authentically cooked, sitting in a cup of concentrated lime juice that's been stuffed with lettuce to fill the space that should have been by more shrimp or other appropriate fish and/or fresh veggies.   All in all, the staff was great but when you feel like you got ripped off for lunch, you're happy you didn't bring friends or family.   Because they were kind and did everything well, I gave them 3/5 stars, however this will not be a place I'll be revisiting in the future.",

    "text": "Many thanks to the Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill for extending a free meal to the Yelp Eliters. My friend and I had the opportunity to visit their new Scottsdale Fashion Square location on Friday. The staff could not have been kinder or more accommodating. We enjoyed the beautiful day eating our lunch on their outdoor patio. I was impressed with their variety of appetizer and entree options. There are plenty of classic \"grease in your gut\" pub platters but they also have healthier selections if you're interested in keeping the caloric content down. We ordered the Grilled Fresh Artichoke and Shrimp Ceviche to start our meal off. The artichoke had a good taste - little chewy - but the crispy onion strings and aioli had great flavor. The shrimp ceviche was fresh, light, and had a little kick with just the right amount of lime. I will admit that it was tough to find the shrimp in the dish - tiny diced pieces vs good sized chunks. Next up was our main entrees - Cubano sandwich and the Black Bean and Quinoa Veggie Burger. My friend was able to perfectly sum up the Cubano, \"Excellent. Mustard and pickles made it; they're the key elements of a Cuban and they nailed it.\" The focaccia was crunchy on the outside and warm in the middle. My black bean burger was delicious. Red quinoa and black beans made it visually appealing while the burger was moist and chocked full of deliciousness. Great job pairing toppings because the avocado, smoked mozzarella, and sun dried tomato pesto were perfect accents to the burger.   It was a good meal and we walked away completely stuffed. Great ambiance and wait staff. TVs and outdoor seating along with spacious interiors make it a good option for group meet ups. Free parking right outside the doors. I would recommend that they extend their non-alcoholic drink options. Fresh brewed herbal teas and fresh lemonades would make a great option if you're not a big fan of soda, Minute Maid, or Lipton.",

I could have called for the manager. One rule I go by is not to anger the people that make your food. Too bad the service was nonexistent. I watch many movies at Harkins and Thirsty Lion would probably have been a great stop for a pint and and some food. Went to the Yard House and got great food and great service.

Thirsty Lion is a bit of a mashup with standard sports bar food mixed in with some pub fare and some reasonably priced cocktails.  Burgers, salads, and calamari are pretty much what you would expect anywhere.  The fish and chips aren't exactly traditional but they were pretty good and they served them with malt vinegar.",

Since I am off work this week (which is rare), we were more than happy to come here and check out the restaurant in Scottsdale.   Location: the restaurant is very well decorated both in the bar and dining area. You don't need to go inside the mall to get into the restaurant. It is clean, relaxing, with few TVs in the bar area if you want to go there and watch sports.   Service: The service was excellent! The hostesses were nice and so was our waitress. She was super attentive and sweet the entire time. She kept coming back to check up on us to make sure we've got everything that we need. Not even once she gave us any attitude knowing that we were here from yelp. I cannot be happier and we made sure to tip her well.   Food: We ordered a total of 3 appetizers: Sesame Ahi Tuna, Traditional Scotch Eggs and Shrimp Ceviche. They are all delicious. The Sesame Ahi Tuna is cooked on the outta layer only and fresh in the inside. The shrimp Ceviche has the right amount of shrimps and seasoning. As for the main entree, we both ordered the Fillet Mignon. It was cooked to my liking. However, it was a bit too salty. No worries - ill ask them to go easy on salt next time.   As for dessert, we ordered a creme brulee and it was soooooooo delicious. It was sweet but not too overpowering. I cannot think of any better way to end our meals.   Rating: I will definitely come back here again to hang out with friends. Thanks for the wonderful complimentary meals!",

    "text": "AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.  ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE!!  Frequent here, WILL NEVER SET FOOT IN THIS PLACE AGAIN!!  Like the ambiance, food is inconsistent at best. Wait staff is hit or miss, mostly miss. Bar staff rocks, offering best service and personality. Sit at bar if you RISK coming here. The only redeeming thing about this place.  On occasions when I have teens w/me, we can't sit at the bar. Table service is ALWAYS a disaster. Ignored for lengthy times (even empty), order gets put in wrong, or not at all. Table service has never been good. NEVER. Not once. Bar is far superior.  Last visit (2 adults, 3 teens), 3 tables were seated after us by at least 5+ minutes. Not slammed busy, plenty of staff, we were served last. By the same waiter. Really???  Ordered 3 apps, some drinks. Tuna was the only thing edible. Actually, very good.  Most teens don't enjoy raw tuna, we got some basic easy stuff you'd think couldn't F up. WRONG!! HORRIBLY WRONG!! Queso dip and flatbread. Cheese dip was oily, grainy, salty, separating- TOTALLY INEDIBLE. Sat uneaten. When the waiter finally came around, mentioned it was totally inedible. \"Sorry you didn't like it.\" Flatbread, which we've enjoyed before, same thing, not edible. Not sure what the chef was thinking, but it wasn't food quality. We all had tried a piece, it appeared 1/2 eaten. However, those pieces were distributed among 5 plates, but remained uneaten except for the first bite or 2 to give it a shot. Mentioned to our waiter that the flatbread wasn't its norm, \"you ate half.\" Hmmm, can clearly see no one ate their piece on their plates, half still remains on serving board - that's your answer?? He knew we were in a rush to make a movie time. Asked for 2 out of 3 uneaten apps to be taken off the bill, obvious we didn't eat them. He replied manager was at shift meeting, it would be a while. Total BS. This guy knew we were in a rush to make a movie time. Also knew service was horrendous (in a corner, repeatedly forgotten). Not a doubt. Used that as an excuse to get us to pay the full bill, increasing his tip, avoiding getting busted for blah service.  I waited tables for years, I'm pretty empathetic to waitstaff. I get there are off days. Waitstaff doesn't cook the food, shouldn't be faulted for bad food. Even though he was a suck arse waiter, former waitress in me can't leave less than 20%, no matter what. Can't be that person. Bad karma. However, had he been worth his salt, not uncommon for me to leave 50-100% of the bill. Waited tables for years, I enjoy spreading love, showing appreciation for a job well done. Good karma.  Left 20% on a bill for cocktails and 3 apps, only 1 of was edible and correctly cooked (lol, basically raw tuna). Mentioned to have manager call me, pretty apparent message wouldn't be received. Mentioned if I didn't hear from them, I'd call to remove the 2 apps from bill, unacceptable to expect us to pay for those. Was told to ask for a specific person.  When I did so, they were never available. I'd ask for my call to be returned. NOTHING!! Not sure the person even exists, or is actually a manager. Think a friend CYA. Must commend cleverness. How about applying that to your work ethic?? Better results!  Like most, I have a busy life, can't chase down an unresponsive manager. Tried a couple times. BUPKISS. Fine, I'll just argue it on my credit card. Not my usual solution, but after such suck arse service all around, I'm just sick and tired of being taken advantage of and paying for truly SHIIT! Received a letter letting me know that the bank investigated and wouldn't be giving me a credit. Hmmm, never asked for any proof from me, which would be my phone bill proving my attempts to call the manager. Forced to escalate to an actual investigation where proof of follow up phone calls will be easily provided. Imagine my surprise that the manager had the time to argue my chargeback, but never had the time to contact a loyal customer.  I've forgiven their lame table service for years, I'm pretty mellow. What I cannot forgive is inferior food being served, obviously uneaten, and yet not removed from the bill. For the amount of around $20-25, they've lost a loyal customer. Great business acumen. Great management. Couple years of going there, never asked for a manager, $-60 of numerous issues - I WILL NEVER RETURN. Hope it was worth it. Given my charge card has a guarantee, I'll get the money eventually. But to make me put more energy into this than they ever did, ludicrous!!  This \"Gastropub\" will give you gastric problems and frustration. AVOID. AVOID. AVOID. Simply isn't worth it. Overpriced, underperforming, lackluster.  AVOID. AVOID. AVOID.  Don't say you weren't warned!! Simply not worth the higher prices for inferior food and table service.",

So please consider that when reading: The menu was just like any other restaurant you might find in a mall with slightly higher than usual prices. I ordered the fish and chips which were quite greasy and I ended up not being able to finish them. My boyfriend ordered the Reuben and he said it was okay.  The cocktail list seemed exciting but I didn't try any. If I were to ever go back to this place it would probably only be for a cocktail and nothing else.. Wouldn't bother spending money on food here.  I guess I can't expect much from a mall restaurant but was hoping for more after reading the reviews here on Yelp.",

    "text": "To whet palates this summer, the Thirsty Lion Garstropub & Grill in Tempe and Scottsdale has introduced a limited-time menu featuring fresh seasonal ingredients, and the food is just as vibrant to look at as it is to taste. I headed to the restaurant to try their summer menu and left feeling full and satisfied, with happy taste buds.  My pal and I noshed on tempura fried green beans to start ($6.95) which came with a sambal chili lime dipping sauce I absolutely loved. I gobbled up every last green bean, which was thickly battered but not overly greasy. I appreciated that the appetizer did have a healthy component to it in the green beans, and they were absolutely addictive - I could have kept eating them!  I got the fresh heirloom tomato caprese salad ($9.95) for my meal, which came with a side of spring greens topped with a white balsamic vinaigrette. The tomatoes, fresh mozzarella and basil were covered in sea salt and a maple balsamic glaze, and I loved this caprese for the thickness of the tomatoes. Everything tasted so fresh, and the glaze to veggie/cheese ratio was appropriate.  My friend got the smoked chicken and pesto pizza ($14.95), a huge portion that is perfect for two people, especially if you're getting an appetizer first. She loved the addition of Kalamata olives on the pie, which also included spinach basil pesto, house smoked chicken, chili flakes, roasted garlic, sundried tomatoes, a four-cheese blend and arugula. She liked the thick crust on the edge, which made it easy to hold, while the thin crust throughout the rest let the toppings shine.  Other entrees on the summer menu include grilled romaine and steak salad ($14.95), mesquite smoked St. Louis ribs ($20.95), seared Atlantic sea scallops ($19.95) and grilled wild Northwest salmon ($24.95). The seasonal cocktails looked mighty tasty and include fresh fruit sangria made with brandy and triple sec, and a raspberry mint mule-jito, made with fresh raspberries muddled with mint, lemon and lime, Bacardi Rum, Malibu rum, simple syrup and Reed's Ginger Beer. I didn't try a cocktail on my lunch break this time, but the drink looked beautiful and seems to be strong, judging by the ingredients.  For dessert, satiate your fresh fruit fix with a strawberry rhubarb and white chocolate cheesecake slice ($6.95), made with fresh whipped cream, strawberry rhubarb puree and fresh sliced strawberries in a chocolate-hazelnut crust. Our meals left us stuffed, so save room for this decadent dessert if you're into those flavors.  The summer menu is available through mid-September.",

I just noticed that they opened a Scottsdale location so we wanted to try this location.   It was hard for me to try the items I wanted because I couldn't eat meat this past Friday that we went and they don't have a lot of non meat items on their happy hour menu. I ended up getting their calamari and their hand cut pub fries. Both were really good. My boyfriend ordered the bacon cheddar potato cakes and he loved it!  I also got their house margarita which is not too shabby.   The only thing that did it for me was the service wasn't great. The waitress didn't write down our order so she couldn't remember it and ended up coming back and asking all of us what we ordered again. To top it off, my sister's drink was wrong. She ordered a vodka lemonade & she brought a vodka and pineapple. Their burger was also incorrect. They wanted it medium, and it came out well done. Note to staff, write down the orders so you get it correct for your customers. The food wasn't terrible, we all actually enjoyed it, however service needs a little work.",

We sat in the bar area and our hostess made a point to let me know about the purse hooks under the table.  Good touch, though it would be even better if they were a little more off to the side.  We had a good view of a few TVs, but not in an overbearing way like in a sports bar.  We started with the California Roll, which greatly satisfied my pregnant lady sushi needs.  I'm not sure what the sauce on the side was, but it had good flavor.  I definitely appreciated that it wasn't a sad 5-piecer, it was actually a good size to split.  My entree was the BBQ White Cheddar Burger.  It was tall, delicious, and next to a pile of really good fries.  I enjoyed it with a cold, tall coke and it made for a great lunch.  For dessert we split the Cream Brulee - it was also large enough to split, so I love that.    Our server got a little busy toward the end of our meal so we saw her less frequently as we tried to settle the bill, but the lunch crowd arrived all at once so it was understandable.  She was friendly and answered all our questions expertly.  Overall the food was great, service was nice, and I will return!",

Our server Gary was super friendly, outgoing and able to answer questions about the menu. We ordered draft beers and my lunch date was happy they had Sculpin IPA available and I went for a tasty Crispin Apple Cider per my usual sweet tooth.  The menu - We loved the bacon wrapped prawns!! They tasted like they were grilled to perfection and who doesn't love bacon wrapped anything?! A must try! The salad under the prawns was even quite tasty and I commented on how I never usually eat the little appetizer salads. This was like a cole slaw that tasted nothing like typical cole slaw.  Next I ordered the Salmon Risotto and it was so creamy! Good stuff! I also tried a few fresh cut fries and believe me they are worth cheating on your diet for the afternoon! Thank you for a great experience!  We sat in the bar area at a table with comfy stools as we chatted and watched sports highlights and music videos on huge flat screen TVs. There is a second bar area which is located in the restaurant. It looks like it could probably service a decent amount of thirsty lions! Can't wait to come back for happy hour!",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to be invited to try out Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill as part of a promo for Yelp Elites.   I got here shortly after opening on a weekday.  The place was nearly empty, but a few tables started to fill up as we were leaving.  I ordered an iced tea and the Sonoran Chicken Enchilada Stack.  I inquired about the side of beans and was told they have lard and bacon as an ingredient, so I asked if I could substitute something else.  They offered me a side salad, which worked out great.  The portion of the enchiladas was sufficient for lunch and I had a little food leftover.  If I had ordered this at dinner, I might be a little hungry after.  The flavor was really good on its own.  Once I sliced the roasted chile that was served with it... that kicked it up to a great flavor!  My stepbrother ordered the Classic Reuben sandwich.  It came with fries.  He ate every crumb off his plate.  He said he was surprised at how good it was!  He said the cheese was perfectly melted and enhanced the flavor of the sandwich.  He even said the fries were perfectly salted and he does not normally like to eat fries.    We were offered dessert, but we declined.  The space was really nice.  I loved the lighting fixtures.  They were very modern, but I felt like I had seen them in another nearby restaurant that closed in the last year.    I had to deduct a point for the service.  The waitress disappeared for a long while and I was waiting for quite a while for a refill.  That said, the manager did stop by and ask how we were doing.  Within a moment of him stopping by, a refill appeared.  I would definitely return to this location of Thirsty Lion again.  I think the menu is slightly different from the Tempe location.  It is such a large restaurant that I think it would be nice to come here for a future happy hour.  Thank you Thirsty Lion and Yelp!",

My review is NOT based on the free factor. :)  I'm grateful for the opportunity to come here because a) I didn't know it'd even opened and b) I probably wouldn't have come in to eat being as how I assumed it was 'bar food'.  They have an expansive menu, but not so expansive that it's overwhelming.  Ranging from your standard healthy and not healthy appetizers, to salads,flatbreads,  burgers, entrees including fish, pasta, etc.. this has something for everyone.   The soup of the day was clam chowder and I enjoyed all of it's creamy goodness. Not too bland, not too salty (common chowder issues),and you could see the large chunks of potato, clams, carrots, etc.  Delicious.  I opted for the steak salad and was not disappointed.  This is quite a large entree size salad and filled me up.  Steak cooked to order is served over a bed of greens, grape tomatoes, red peppers, and toasted onions with balsamic. Delicious. The chimichurri sauce on the steak is delicious.  My service was prompt, courteous and I didn't feel rushed.  They have standard and late night happy hours and ample tv coverage in the bar itself.   They also have a great variety of beers for this beer snob. :) This is a great addition to the mall and will give that *other* sports bar a run for it's money.",

    "text": "Received a free lunch courtesy of Thirsty Lion. Thanks guys!  Stepped in and had an amazing array of various appetizers before our main entrees arrived. We shared the ahi tuna, Scotch eggs, and ceviche. The ceviche had a nice spicy kick to it and had a good balance of sweetness and acidity. The Scotch eggs were probably my favorite part of the meal. They were perfectly cooked, with a slightly runny, dark golden center and perfectly fried, providing a good balance of textures. The ahi was decent and came in a very generous portion.  I ordered the filet mignon ($28). It arrived with some grilled asparagus, perched on top of some mashed potatoes. The filet had lovely deep grill marks, Coated with a thin layer of butter. The server asked us to cut into the meat to make sure we were happy with the doneness (Medium rare), which I appreciated. The mashed potatoes were decent, and the asparagus was grilled nicely.  To gild the lily we ended our meal by sharing some creme brulee. It was a very rich concoction, packed with buttery taste. While the sugary, caramelized crystalline top was excellent the rest of the dessert was just a little runny.  Service was excellent and were checked on as needed.  This is definitely a good place to dine if you are at Scottsdale Fashion Square!",

    "text": "I was happy to be able to check out the new Thirsty Lion location at Scottsdale Fashion Square, and even happier that they were willing to treat me to lunch to do so. Full disclosure here that my meal was covered by the Thirsty Lion, but I assure you that the awesomeness of a \"free lunch\" did not influence my review. I have been to their Tempe Marketplace location, but I've mostly had beer and appetizers there -- try the Traditional Scotch Eggs if you're not counting calories and want something amazing: hard-cooked eggs wrapped in sausage, lightly breaded and fried. They cut them in half and serve with a robust mustard. Yeah, it's better than bacon.  I was greeted promptly when I arrived. My server's name was Lindsey and she stopped by to introduce herself and get my drink order shortly after I was seated and had a chance to look at the menu. Since this was a workday lunch, I stuck with the iced tea, but I did check out the \"adult beverage\" menu since they tout having 25 beers on tap.  The beer list tends toward the lighter side: lots of IPAs, ciders and pale ales. If you're into that, bonus. As for the stouts, I think I saw only two. I believe they offer a 16oz or a 20 oz pour of any on-tap beers. In addition to the beer list, there are some modern takes on classic mixed drinks (Moscow Mule, Manhattan, Old Fashioned, etc.) and another list of signature cocktails that looked interesting.  Based on the \"pub\" feel of the place, you'd think it was the typical things like burgers and fries, fish and chips, and other greasy \"pub-style\" fare. Yes, that is available, but their eclectic menu also has several salads as well as fun items like spicy Mac & Cheese, Chicken Enchiladas, and even Sushi and vegetarian options. I narrowed my options down to three: Sonoran Chicken Enchilada Stack, NW Pub Burger or Roasted Pork Cubano Sandwich. Lindsey was helpful and told me that she hadn't yet tried the cubano, but liked the two other options. I figured a burger is a good thing to try at a pub, and it had \"maple pepper bacon\" on it: SOLD!\"  I opted for the side salad just to try something besides fries. I took the time to take some notes, check my email, and review the drink menu again. I swear it wasn't 10 minutes before my burger was sitting in front of me in all its freshly-grilled glory. I posted a picture... it's a little blurry since it smelled great and I was HUNGRY. This was no paltry fast food-style burger. I had a thick and juicy burger like the kind you'd make at home if you had the time to do it right. At first bite, I noticed the juciness and flavor of the grilled meat was complimented by a little heat from horseradish. This was supported by sweet and salty from the bacon, which had a nice crunchiness as a result of the maple -- it was a bit caramelized and cooked to perfection. The burger was served on what looked like a ciabatta roll, which was good because the burger needed something sturdy to hold it all together. The arugula was put under the beef patty so that it wilted nicely, and the white cheddar cheese was melted very nicely. The grilled sweet onion -- a monstrous slice of onion about 1/3\" thick and grilled -- was very tasty, but it slipped around a bit and required a bit of skill to keep inside the bun while eating. The one thing I didn't notice was the \"gorgonzola infused\" part of the burger. It may have been so subtle that the other flavors eclipsed it, but it might have been one of those things that as such an integral part of the experience that I would wonder what was wrong if it weren't there.   Bottom line: Messy burger, but awesome.  The side salad had a light dressing... Just enough. The greens were fresh, but nothing special.   I usually don't eat much dessert, and almost never at lunch, but Lindsey recommended their blackberry cobbler with orange shortbread crust. Wait. What? I asked if the blackberries were fresh and she thought they were. Okay, I've got to try that! The crust definitely tasted of orange, and there were large blackberries inside. If they weren't fresh, they were picked and frozen at just the right time. The filling was hot and tasted of warm spices... cardamom, maybe? The whole thing was topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream. I posted a picture of that here as well. I made a note about the quality of the vanilla ice cream. You can tell a lot about a place from the quality of the ice cream they use in their desserts. This was high quality, dense ice cream with flecks of vanilla bean easily visible... it could be a dessert on its own.  The bar area is a lot like the Tempe location, but there is a section off to the left of the hostess station with a lot of tables, including some outdoor seating... and I am out of room to write...",

The best part of the experience was the hostess.  She had on extremely high heeled shoes.  You could tell it was excruciating for her to walk.  She limped and cringed every step of the way to our table and back to the hostess stand.  When her shift was over, she stood next to the stand in her barefoot. Not cool in a restaurant.

The salmon plate, the shrimp tacos and my orange chicken were all plated with such finesse.  And all were as equally impressed by the taste.    They also have a multitude of craft beers to choose from... both local and global.  The interior ambiance was excellent.  I think it would be fun to be seated in the front patio, but we were seated in the inner mall patio.

    "text": "Let me just begin with how much I enjoy food.  Especially when I receive a complimentary meal.  I was one of the lucky ones to be able to have lunch here after I received a Yelp Elite invitation that came directly from Thirsty Lion to our wonderful community manager Lindsey.  I rsvp'd as directed and Alyssa Shelton was very accommodating with my schedule.  She reserved me a table for two.    When we arrived I stated to the hostess that I was here by Yelp invitation and they knew exactly what I was referring to.  After getting seated I asked our waitress what the details and or restrictions were for my invite.  She confirmed with the manager that anything I ordered would be on the house.  I jokingly said \"one of everything on the menu then!\"  I didn't ask if alcoholic beverages were included since I did have to return to my place of work after lunch.  Appetizer:  You can't go wrong with the oven baked soft pretzel.  Soft and buttery with a side of horseradish mustard I believe.  Entree:  I ordered the pepperoni, spicy Italian sausage with four cheese blend pizza.  It was as delicious as it sounds I promise.  My wife ordered the Brussels sprouts quinoa with chicken salad.  Tasted fresh and it was amaze-balls!  We also ordered a side of fries to treat our glutinous appetite.  No desserts, but I sure did want to taste them all.  Service was great and I even asked our waitress to charge my card for something so that I could leave her the 20% tip she earned from the total bill.  Overall the location is great.  I can see it getting very busy on weekends and it's also very spacious.  Can't wait to go back :)",

The manager was amazing and made sure we were happy, since there was a slight wait on the chicken- which we honestly had no problem waiting and didn't even think it was taking long. The fact that he came over and apologized before we got our food, checked up on our food and comp'd some of the meal was really above and beyond- THANK YOU Brian!   We ordered a Spicy Chicken Sandwich which was one of the best I've ever had. They cook their chicken to serious perfection and we love that they done use oversized chicken either, the bun to chicken ratio was perfect and not overbearing.   I myself ordered off the brunch menu and got the Spicy Chicken and Waffles and it was really delicious! The chicken again was cooked to literal perfection super crispy with jalapeno mixed in the batter YUMMMMMY. The waffles were really great, crispy on the outside. The maple syrup was BOMB and come out sizzling hot off the stove which I can appreciate as I dumped it all over my entire plate!!! Plus it came with two pieces of bacon which I assume were cooked in syrup and they were nice and crunchy.!  This meal was honestly the best I've had in a while. I loved it all, and I'll be back again soon! You def have to try it out, and I HIGHLY suggest the chicken!",

    "text": "You might not know it, but if you knew it, you would know that this place is a chain. Did that make sense? No? Read on....  You'd go, \"this place feels like a warm pub, big and solid, familiar, big mature menu, lots of staff.....but something isn't quite right.\" Here's the deal, The Thirsty Lion feels like it's between a family owned restaurant and becoming a young-chain. You know, pretty comfortable, where their food and atmosphere is still a bit like an original, family owned place, but it's trying to be something bigger. You can feel that they are trying to \"grow up\", maybe into something bigger than they're ready for, becoming \"chain like\" in their mass produced food and broad staff requirements where training has become a bit less important. It's a nice place with a huge variety of menu and drink options. Overall, it seemed that the quality control in both food and table service could use some attention.  Below is the deal on our specific visit. Keep in mind, I believe a couple things were anomalies, but having not been to this location before, I wouldn't know for sure, so I'm rating on our specific experience.  **Atmosphere** - we sat on the patio after walking through the restaurant. Lots of dark, warm wood and truly does feel like a gigantic Irish pub. I like the heavy woods and dark colors and brick and plants on the patio, it was comfortable. For the last 20 to 30 minutes of our 3 hour visit, there was an incredible stink on the patio. To a nose that knows, it was clearly sewer gas. There was a floor sewer drain about 10 feet from our table where the 'trap' had clearly run dry. This allowed sewer gas to come up and stink us out. I grabbed a cloth napkin and soaked it with water from one of our water glasses and covered the drain with it and placed a heavy plant from the table on top. This stopped about 90% of the stink. The manager, a super nice guy (more on him fixing something else below) came over and poured a bucket of water into the drain and taped over the drain to keep the smell away. Really appreciated his proactive diligence.  **Service** - The service was good, pretty friendly, albeit a little slow at times and not incredibly knowledgeable, although willing to go find out answers to our questions. Overall, the table service just seemed \"immature\". The only way I can explain it is that our server and the others who delivered the food, seemed that maybe it was one of their first serving jobs and they hadn't been doing it terribly long. They cared, they just weren't always sure what to do.  **Food** - The Thirsty Lion has a really big, nicely varied menu with tons of food options. The portions are decent and the overall quality is good. Our issues included noodles that were only \"par cooked\", which means they were mostly raw and when you picked one up off of your plate, it didn't hang down and wiggle, it was stiff and held a zigzag shape. Our server was a little confused on what to do and ultimately took the dish away. Unprompted, the manager came over and could not have been nicer. He was extremely friendly and apologetic and offered a myriad of ways to remedy the situation. He admitted that the entire batch of pasta that was prepped in the kitchen was incorrect. He brought us one of the biggest softest and most delicious pretzels I have ever eaten, along with three amazing sauces. Kudos to him for his honesty and excellent service! Honestly, because of our two interactions with him, he kept this from being a two star review. Another dish that our server had reported to be \"mildly spicy\" was at least a 7 on a spicy scale of 10. It was pretty hot for the average person. Fortunately a couple of us liked it spicy and ate it anyway. Had we not been pretty laid-back and liked spicy, this would have been another problem.  **Overall** - Based on our experience, I wouldn't rush back to The Thirsty Lion. But, to find out if it is normally better and this visit was just an anomaly, I would try it again. I have been to The Thirsty Lion at Tempe Marketplace and did not have similar issues and would rate it a 3 1/2 to 4 stars.",

My boyfriend loves the Romano Chicken.   Their menu offers lots of different options, and servings are pretty generous, so if you aren't a huge eater, leftovers are a plus! Large wine and beer menu too. They offer 9oz pours of wine as an option - if you know what I mean.   They are also super friendly and accommodating to large parties. No forced small menu or one big check.   Friendly staff, and great location. Worth checking out!",

Did I missed something, when  did \"Mother's Day\" become a holiday or does that matter. I even attempted to explain to the waiter that there's a law that a business has to honor a advertised posted price. My daughter had a reservation, we wanted to have dinner & drinks.  The advertised Margarita special was $5 during \"Happy Hour\" the waiter advised us after consulting with the manager of my complaint with the price now for a Margarita at$8.50.  Did that same restriction apply to the customers that were single men being served at the bar or the man and his minor child sitting at a table without a woman. Yes, we left that restaurant, we took our business elsewhere on \"Mother's Day\"",

And, they're not.   I believe it's when they get slammed, they forget about you. And when they're not, well... the staff slows down to catch their breath. It's really both the front of the house and in the kitchen.   A good example is our most recent visit last night. Our server Tim was first rate and we experienced no problems. In fact, Tim as great. Now I order the French Dip as I have recently, but last night they...  well served some well done and hard to digest meat (photo). I've also posted another French Dip photo from 6 months ago.   We like the Thirsty Lion and yes, we are Four Star \"Fan\". We just hope for some uniformity, or a good Culinary Manager to watch over the process better.   Enjoy!",

But one often gets the feeling that the menus in most of these types of establishments are fairly similar and there is not always a wide variety of choices.  First of all, the Thirsty Lion has a very comprehensive menu that can stand toe to toe with traditional restaurants.  Secondly, it's quite a large place and is well appointed.  As I was dining solo, I chose to sit at the bar where I could be up close to the televisions.  The service I received from Brian was impeccable. A friendly guy who was at the top of his game.  I tried the shrimp ceviche and it was darned good.  We made some small talk which enhanced my experience.  They offered a seasonal menu, a happy hour menu and their regular menu. Lots of choices. I intend to return and check out other items on their menu.",

    "text": "I have been consistently disappointed in the service at most Scottsdale restaurants since moving here about six months ago.  Can't say that about this joint.  Our waitress was Lindsey and she was on the ball from the second we got there.  Ordered a pear martini and a craft beer flight, calamari for appetizer and then shared the shrimp tacos and bleu cheese burger that was on special.  The main courses were a little cold when they came out, but the flavor was great for everything so it wasn't a deal breaker.  Calamari was crispy and fresh, the aioli to dip them in was perfectly seasoned and both the tacos and burger were cooked and seasoned to perfection.  While removing the plates from our table, a salsa spilled and splashed onto our clothes.  This kind of thing happens often to us, for reasons unknown, but the way it was handled was as good as it could be without discounting the check.  After apologizing, the manager stopped by to make sure everything was ok.  While there I noticed you can get 1/2 price off your pizza if you're there before or after a movie, which is something to remember for next time.  The prices were still a little steep, but hands down the best service we've had at any joint in this mall.  Since the only other one I've been to was in Tempe Marketplace, this location definitely impressed me more!",

    "text": "Empty on a Sat night and we know why (although to be fair, we were looking for something quiet, which this was). Walked past PACKED bars/restaurants in Fashion Square (Kona/Yard/Z Tejas) that obviously are much bigger hits than this.   One bartender for bar and bar area by patio (Zach). Very slow service. He's not fast or efficient and needs which compounds the problem. I also put this on management for either the staffing and/or layout of bars, point of sale terminals (which he spends way too much time doing). Doesn't clean off bar, every customer needs something constantly.  It's not clear on beer list what beers are served in a pint glass or a tulip.  Pet peeve - no beer prices on menu. Why? Because they're very pricey.   Bartender said reverse happy hour starts at 10:30pm but menu says 9:30pm 7 days a week. Need to give accurate info (He had to check the computer to see). It does start at 9:30pm.  Coors Light pint is $4 on HH? And only one other beer on HH? Lame! Plus, way too much head on the beer pours.  They do have a lot of HH food options. Brussels sprouts good. Kale salad was small and had almost nothing but Kale on it, despite menu description.  Wasting a HUGE TV behind the bar with music videos.  The other two are showing a replay of an NFL game. Meanwhile there's a Cubs Dodgers MLB game being played (But not shown on any TVs here). Boo.   Who I think was the manager (only one wearing white shirt) was surly in response to a simple/friendly question and answered while he kept walking away from us. Front bartender Chris was not friendly.  As it gets closer to closing time (midnight) you will start to see more hustle by the staff than you've seen all night - they are all just dying to close up shop, and make it very obvious to anyone left after 11pm (which is not many). Guess we all just can't wait to leave.  This place won't make it without changes.",

There weren't many customers and it was probably because it was late on a Wednesday night. The ambiance was lovely and intimate. My friend and I ordered pulled pork sliders and the Classic Reuben sandwich halved with fries. The pulled pork sliders were so filling even though we split it between the two of us. I don't know what magic they cook it with but the coleslaw and the pulled pork went together like peanut butter and apple slices. The hand-cut fries were delicious because you could taste the freshness inside. Moreover, the sandwich was loaded with meat and was more than enough to make us want to come back again. Our server was really sweet also.",

Also, not really our server's fault, but they did not have enough servers on the floor on a Friday night.  so our server was really busy and we were really hungry but had to wait about 15 minutes to place our food orders.  we kept looking for our server to get her attention so we could place our order, but she was either nowhere to be found or occupied with another table and didn't glance over at us as she just went back into the kitchen.",

I heard Thirsty Lion has amazing food, so i was really excited to go. The place was very clean, the people were so nice and our server was amazing. Our drinks and food came out at such perfect timing. I ordered the veggie burger, I'm not exactly sure what it's called on the menu, but it's a veggie patty with some pesto and other condiments in there served as a vegetarian option. I'm neither vegetarian or vegan, but i do like to eat healthier when i can. The burger was AMAZING! It was so flavorful and i feel that it was pricey, but it was not over priced. Such a cute place for date night. We sat outside. I think inside gave more of a \"typical eating out vibe\". Overall, so yummy. Get their cheese dip! It's amazing!",

I have had the burger here before and was excited to introduce my friend to it. The patty used to be thick and juicy, now it was flat and dry like a pancake. Not sure why they press the patty down so it is flat. The purpose of this burger is to look and feel like a hamburger, a thick patty not a piece of cardboard for $15!  Update: Spoke with the manager, Jeff. He tells me they hand press 4oz patties for their Impossible burgers. That's kinda small, most burgers are 6-8oz pre-cooked. They flatten them to fit the larger buns that they use for the real meat burgers. Great job on ruining this product!  Save your money and just go to Cheesecake Factory.",

They do offer outdoor seating as well as indoor. It is inside a mall some of your not familiar with the place it can be difficult to find even with gps. I parked in the parking garage designated for Harkins and found it was really close to the restaurant. They had some appetizers which was a teriyaki shrimp I believe and everyone loved them as well as chips and salsa which were really good and I believe artichoke dip.   For the entree they had salmon , chicken with rice and mashed potatoes with veggies , all were very good but especially loved the chicken and Caesar salad .  Now onto the dessert which consisted of a s'mores in a jar which was absolutely amazing definitely a must try if stopping by , they also had a bread pudding cake and creme brulee' which I unfortunately didn't try cause I was stuffed but everyone said they were both great as well.",

The service was lacking a little bit but you could see the manager filling the gaps & helping out, that is the mark of a well run restaurant.  I like the Salmon Asparagus Risotto (so good). My Wife loves the fish n chips (she is very picky too).",

    "text": "Looking for dinner while at the mall, the Lion called to us.  It was not super busy and perhaps the dining crowd is dictated my mall traffic.  We were seated out on their 'patio' (not really a patio, just good people watching of mall patrons) and the server came right over and took our drink order.  They had a pretty sweet happy hour menu, along with a full menu of interesting items from unique salads to plated entrees.    We opted for the fried cauliflower, spicy chix sliders and a pork carnitas salad bowl.  Everything was really delicious... but the cauliflower is off the charts delicious.  I would come back for that alone, and I live down in Tucson.  Service was a smidge slow given they were not that busy, but solid and food tasty.",

They knew we were catching a movie, so they got us in and out in 49 minutes. The wait staff and bartenders were incredibly friendly and attentive and the food was excellent.  I had the Gastropub burger and it was OUTSTANDING, but you better like Gorgonzola because it's filled with it!  We also had the fish tacos which were totally delicious.  This will be our new spot before movies!!!",

They even have happy hour from 3-6pm & 9:30pm to close, everyday!   They have seats inside which the lights are turned low or outside like a patio in the mall. It's noisy inside compared to the mall side.   So we got the creamy queso dip and OMG it was amazing! Definitely recommend it! Also I got the filet mignon, it comes with mash potatoes & asparagus. It was delicious! Definitely recommend it as well. My brother got the pulled pork and he liked it too.   Definitely will come back! Was really happy with how the food tasted!   They take reservations as well. Also it's a good family restaurant too.   Also when you check in they ask for your name and phone number then will text you when your table is ready.",

The effort shows True interest in improving what's wrong while continuing what's right - and it is appreciated.  I will give the Thirsty Lion another go when I return to the Valley, their efforts to connect with their customers absolutely merit at least that. Kudos to the customer care team.",

Food: amazing! We had brunch today and I had the pub breakfast. Came with sausage or bacon, I got sausage. Potatoes, eggs and toast! Everything was amazingly delicious. Wish they gave more potato's tho! My daughter ordered the berry waffles. Oh my it was so yummy! She loved it and I too loved taking bites off her plate.   Service...here we go!  Son of a bitch the wait was awful! Our server, Christ, wasn't very attentive AT ALL! I still gave him a good tip bc I'm not an ass. I know people have bad days. I think maybe he had too many table to wait on. When he was at our table, he was polite but awkward. My mom and I asked for coffee...wasn't hot. But whateves. Asked for more, didn't get it till the end of our meal and Chris says sorry it took so long but this is a fresh brew. Which it was but cmon, that's what we wanted to begin with for our first cup. Our food came out soooooo late. We ordered at 1:40 didn't get our food till 2:15! Is that normal wait? Am I trippin? Someone tell me if I am.   So over all, food was great! Service was sub par at best",

When I was told they have more than just drinks I was curious. they have a dish available for all tastes, so its a great place to take your girlfriend when she doesn't know what she wants to eat.   I had the shrimp risotto and it was so delicious. The seasonal menu was by far my favorite! They had some great spinach artichoke dish, calamari, and spicy cauliflower that I wanted a whole pan of.   the environment is very romantic and low and warm lighting, so again, great place to take your girlfriend ;)  I would never have thought to come here, so shout out to my work people for choosing this place for dinner. I had a blast, the staff was so kind and accommodating, and it was overall someplace I will probably take my girlfriend... seeing that I am single, probably just come alone though haha.",

It was such a large sandwich it needed a knife, rather than a toothpick, to hold it together.  Like King Arthur with Excalibur, I drew the knife out of the sandwich before eating it.  Some of my friends have suggested the knife was stuck in the sandwich in case someone wanted to cut their sandwich into smaller pieces to eat.  Fortunately my mouth is big enough I was able to eat the sandwich without having to cut it into smaller pieces.  Noticed another good thing while there.  The wines that are available by the glass are available in two different sizes.  If I hadn't been driving right after lunch would have ordered a glass of wine (the smaller size) while at the Thirsty Lion.",

The last time I was here the drink special was great but this experience was not a good one. There are a TON of better restaurants to go to in Scottsdale. Waiter was not friendly at all. It took a long time for us to get our first and only order of three drinks. We were excited for the $4.95 house margaritas. The waiter walked away so quickly and he didn't ask us if we wanted salt or sugar. It was the worst margarita I've had in Arizona. So sweet and artificial with what it seemed to be no alcohol. Food has always been poor for how expensive it is. We had the happy hour pretzel and it tasted like cheap out of the box freezer pretzel. Dipping sauces were bland and nothing special. Will not be back. Do not recommend. Nothing special here.",

THE IMPOSSIBLE BURGER of course...as I continue my journey with you through my Favorite VEGAN spots in the Valley of the Sun I found this little jewel at the Fashion Square Mall in Scottsdale.   Remember the focus is on the presentation here so here is how the Impossible Burger is served at The Thirsty Lion...Soy & plant-based protein burger grilled with melted cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, dill pickles, 1000 Island and served on a toasted brioche bun.  So with this selection, you have to ask for NO Cheese so remember to bring some from home...also there is no mayo so bring that as well. The bun is made with egg but I don't think they have a VEGAN option for it so you have to be careful there. We had it before we knew it had the egg so we won't be having that again...LOL!!!! Now be advised if you want Ketchup or Mustard just ask for it because most all establishments do have these condiments of course. This establishment has both indoor and outdoor seating and if you don't mind the crowds too much this could be a nice little spot to try if you getting hungry while shopping. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!",

While she was nice and knowledgeable with the menu she was just very slow to do anything. Our drink orders took 12+ minutes to get to us both times we ordered drinks. Food came out in a timely manner. I had the bacon Mac and cheese and the wife had a burger. Like I said food was excellent service not so. You can do much better in Fashion Square Mall.

We stopped in after our movie to grab a bite because boyf told me I would not be cooking. Our server was sweet and understanding that we probably wouldn't be her most profitable table because we had just eaten our weight in popcorn, but wanted to grab a salad and a glass of wine, and enjoy the OH SO GORGEOUS weather and sit on the 'You're a wizard Harry' patio that is Thirsty Lion Fashion Square.  Reading the other reviews in the side panel, I now wish I had stopped into the \"fancy British bathrooms\" because I am sure it would have convinced me I had stepped into a time continuum on the escalator out of the theatre. Neither here nor there.   Anyway, 500000 stars for the build out done on the space. Salad was caesar and nothing to write home about, will return and try something to give a real rating for. 5 stars for great Sauvignon Blanc because good wine is good wine. 5 stars to the movie we saw because it was phenomenal.",

The spinach artichoke dip with the flatbread is outstanding, as are the Hamburger sliders. The place also gives a 50 percent discount on a pizza before or after the movie with a valid movie ticket. We had the margherita pizza, which was also good and cooked perfectly. Although we missed the happy hour hours, the specials they offer during their happy hour are abundant and nearly half the price for things. Return visits here are definitely in our future.",

Definitely beats the food court when it comes to wanting a nice comfortable sit down place to eat.",

With the prospect of my Christmas shopping looking grim I decided it was time to regroup and grab lunch and a drink. I need a place that was away from all the commotion and figured Thirsty Lion would be my perfect place of refuge.  Walking in they were super busy, I found my little spot of heaven at the bar and quickly ordered a bloody mary. It was delicious and was nice and spicy. I arrived during HH, but I had my eyes on their I.P.A. Beer Battered Fish & Chips Crispy fried with Napa slaw, lemon caper tartar sauce and hand-cut fries. They arrived pretty quickly and they were delicious. Perfectly crispy on the outside and nice and juicy inside. Their slaw had a great flavor and their fries were great. I was really pleasantly surprised by how delicious the food was and how great the service was. Thirsty Lion Gastropub & Grill is the perfect spot for a quick and delicious meal!",

    "text": "My fiance and I made reservations through Open Table over a week ago for my birthday. I really wanted to try Thirsty Lion because it had great reviews online and I love the Fashion Square area.  So we get there, the hostess starts walking towards us and instead of greeting us she just stands there staring at us. After a few seconds, my fiance tells her we have a reservation under Chris. She looks at us and says \"reservation, for Chris?\" looking at us as if she has never heard the term reservation in her life and proceeds to roll her eyes at us. Instead of grabbing menus to seat us, she takes a phone call, leans over the counter and starts to twirl her hair as she spoke with the person on the other line. After a few minutes, she rudely said to follow her to our table. We get to the table and we are both in a horrible mood because of this hostess who clearly hates her job and it showed. Thankfully our waitress was very nice and accommodating. However, our drinks (Pinot Grigio and an Old Fashion) took over 20 minutes to get to our table even though it was a slow night, and the small plates she brought over were dirty which I did point out to her. She came back with another plate and that one was dirty as well so we just decided not to use them. The only nice thing I can say about this place is that the food was good and the waitress was nice. Other than that, there is nothing that will make me want to go back. My fiance and I were there to have a nice dinner and to celebrate my birthday and I cant say that it was a nice experience. I will not be back. I was very tempted to leave and just go over to Shake Shack next door.",

When we arrived, the hostess acted as if we had imposed on her otherwise world-peace enabling duties.  She tried to force us into a booth in the back of the relatively empty dining room, and she audibly scoffed when we asked for a standard table with chairs to better enable our mobility with our infant. There were plenty available, afterall.  Once seated it took some time for our server to come over.  Prior to her arrival at our table she had to go through the process of loudly arguing with a couple of her other serving colleagues about their apparent failings at life, so her attitude while gracing us with her presence was less than chipper.  She took our orders, brought our food, and processed our check.  So she did her job, but no extra \"pieces of flair\" to warrant a particularly good tip.    Overall the kitchen and bar were slow, and the service was pretty terrible.  Won't be planning to return and wouldn't recommend unless you really just want to catch a game and could care less about service.  There is better quality food nearby.",

Don set us up with reserved seating by the bar, set up an additional table for the food I pre-ordered for my guests & staggered the food as I requested.  Normally I spend time away from my guests to supervise the arrival of food & chase down the wait staff for my guests.  Don & his staff made MY night fun & effortless. I didn't have to make requests and the wait staff were ever-present.   I was able to spend time with my friends and enjoy the evening.    As the night went on, I requested additional food & dessert to be brought out.  Everything looked and tasted great.  There was not one drop left. All  of my guess remarked how good the food was.  I asked the wait staff to make sure my guests 1st drink was on my bill & then the rest would be on separate bills.  They did not go one drink over.  Eric & CJ kept coming over to check on us regularly. They were so friendly and polite. Each one shook my husband's hand & wished him a happy birthday.  As we left for the evening, we were in the parking lot & one of the hostesses who help us upon arrival stopped as she was driving by to wish him a happy birthday & make sure our evening went well.  A real class act.    I should mention again, the food was awesome.  We had everything from sliders, to chicken tenders to flat breads to sushi....and an incredible brownie dessert.  Everything was brought out hot, & well presented.  We have been to the Thirsty Lion before for dinner & have always been pleased.  I host this party every year and have not been as happy with the food & service elsewhere as I was this year with the Thirsty Lion.  We will be back to host there next year. (...for dinner sooner!)    If you are looking for a great place with great food and GREAT STAFF..... this is your hot spot for dinner or a party.  Thank you Don & Staff for making this a fun & carefree night.",

The bartender completely ignored me because she was too busy talking to somebody at the end of the bar I just assumed it was her boyfriend finally after getting her attention she came over and very rudely said what can I get you I explained to her that I had a free appetizer from the coupon sent to me in the mail and I also decided to get the fish and chips with the pretzel appetizer which I do you normally do get at Tempe location I also ordered a beer which took about 15 minutes to get there when I finally received my food it they both came on at the same time I really would have liked my appetizer pretzel first however I didn't complain.  They forgot to give me tartar sauce for the fish and chips after I asked her for the north side of tartar sauce she completely ignored me also the queso dip for the pretzels seem to be heard and on top like it had been sitting around for awhile so I requested another one with a side of some sort of mustard after that she walked away seem very angry with me I decided that I was going to leave I requested the bill and to go boxes which she completely ignored I work in the food industry and I have never been known anybody to be treated this way I was so appalled. I really didn't feel like being at the restaurant anymore so I requested my bill after waiting 10 minutes for my bill to come it finally arrived with the appetizer on the bill I explained to her that only the coupon and she had taken it already I was so upset I just I wanted to get out of there so I left 30$ on the bar and left I Will never return to the thirsty lion",

Rather than cause a scene I allowed the manager to decide what he thought would be acceptable to make it right.  So he apologized.  Maybe my approach was off.  Not that I wanted my meal comp'd but it would have been a nice surprise to see a little something taken off.  The service otherwise was good and the server was great.",

    "text": "The 4 stars is for food only. The service kinda sucked. We like to sit at the bar specifically because the bar tender is always there to talk to or just if you need anything. We were the only people at the bar and the bar tender was never here. Our appetizer plate sat in front of us the entire time we ate our entrees. We also had no app plates or silverware or napkins until we were almost done with the appetizer. She would disappear for 15 minutes at a time multiple times. She said she worked at the Tempe location for 4 years so I'm shocked at the lack of customer service. My husband was a server for 6 years and I was a server and bar tender for 10 years so we know how it should be. The edamame was delicious. Fish tacos were delicious. My husband had the tavern burger and he loved it and was happy they understood what medium rare is BC every time he gets one ordered that way it comes out well done. Would have given 5 stars if service was better...the bar tender was really nice even tho she wasn't visible very much.",

We tried to enjoy a Saturday evening dinner here.  Not possible.  I do have to say, the drinks were OK, the dinner was so --- so, I had scallops, all 4 (FOUR) of them for $19.99 were OK, rice was like I make at home in 5 minutes.  Thankfully my husband had fish and chips and I enjoyed his french fries.  Food OK, nothing special, drinks OK, price OK, service nothing special, but the NOISE, now that was special, ESPECIALLY NOISY.  Forget the crying babies, they can't do much about that, and I understand they are a Mall restaurant, so I understand the families.  Surprisingly, when we went to Z Tejas for a QUIET drink after dinner there were no crying babies, NO LOUD LOUD MUSIC, the TVs were quietly on so we knew what was happening.  So sorry, we loved the Thirsty Lion in Tempe for Happy Hour and lunch, but this is our last visit for dinner at Fashion Square.  Could the LOUD MUSIC wait until after at least maybe 7 PM or 8 PM?????",

    "text": "Having lived in Portland, OR the last 5 years - I've become somewhat of a food-snob and sometime critic. I loved living in a town that is known for it's fantastic dining - unique food trucks - and utter lack of national chain restaurants.  Moving to Phoenix was a good thing - I love the cactus, the sun, and swimming pools.  But I also love exploring new locations to dine.  I enjoy exciting menu options - new things I've never tried, old familiar things that are re-created, and old familiar things done just the right way that you expect.  How excited I was to receive an invitation for a complimentary lunch at the new Scottsdale location of the Thirsty Lion Gastropub and Grill!  I have to admit - I was a bit pensive thinking of how my previous experiences would translate to this new location.   Walking in the front door - all concerns disappeared.  Staff at the front of the house were efficient and friendly.  Just what you expect.  We were given a choice of seating locations and selected one by the window.  They even have some outdoor seating that would be fabulous in this wonderful spring we're enjoying.  Our Server - I believe it was Matt C - showed right up as soon as we sat down and took our drink order.  Matt was just like the others we had met - helpful, easy to chat with, efficient, and present when he needed to be without being a \"helicopter server\".  We reviewed various appetizer options - I was impressed with the list.  We quickly settled on the tempura beans.  While we waited for them - we reviewed the menu.  I noted that I was pleased with the number of menu options that I had to choose from - not too many, not too few... just right.  And very enticing.  I love it when I have a hard time choosing between several options - rather than trying to zero in on the least offensive one!  The appetizer came out suprisingly quick - hot, tasty, and an appropriate amount for two people with an appetite.  I would have preferred they had a little less batter - but not so much i hesitated to eat them. They were awesome!  The dipping sauce served with them was very very very good.  We next narrowed down our main courses.  Dining companion went for the fish and chips - I struggled between the enchilada stack - it sounds awesome - and the Reuben.  Matt said both were solid - but he LOVED their ruben.  Ahh - it's March.  St Paddy's is coming up ... and since I had had a nice big meal last night - I hoped that the sandwich would serve a purpose - to fulfill it's role as a delicacy that \"a king uses to purge himself of the \"demon of gluttony\". \"  Sorry ... this sandwich was so good - I believe their Corned Beef did the opposite to me.  I asked for a side of grain mustard - I don't know if it's home made or not - Matt told us that they use fresh product everywhere on the menu.  It shows.  The bread was the freshest rye I've ever had.  Every ingredient seemed as if they had labored for days to find the right product or recipe to complete my dish.  Loved the fries - but I just can't get over how much I loved my sandwich.   My dining companion had the fish and chips.  I tasted a bite with the tarter sauce and loved it.  Very solid.  He substituted the fries (which I LOVED with my Reuben) for a salad.  Blasphemy! lol... his salad was fresh and the dressing again - tasted homemade.  If it's not - they've found a great purveyor!   He filled up quickly - so I was able to taste his cole slaw.  OMG - seriously the best coleslaw I've ever had.  Too often it's over dressed, over sweet, watery, bland.  This was perfect.  I could go back just to have a side of slaw!  (Next time - regardless of what I order - I may just get a side of slaw!)  Desert was good.  He had the creme brulee - very good.  I ordered the blackberry cobbler with an orange scented crust and vanilla bean ice cream.  Very very good - only criticism was that there was a little \"too much\" blackberry... but hey - i'd complain VERY loudly if there was't enough.   Service was solid - Matt was perfect.  Kitchen sent out the food very fast, well prepared, hot, and spot on.  Manager circulated through to check on all patrons.  Smart.  How else are you going to know how things are going.  I'm surprised more managers don't show up table side!  The location is fantastic.  Decor makes you feel like you're in a pub as expected.  Several tables filled - one with a very large group that seemed to enjoy just as quick service as we did at our table of two.  Bathrooms were easy to access and spotless.    Bottomline - Home Run! (Oh wait - that's what I need to do next - spring training games and then back to the Thirsty Lion for more fantastic dining.)    Thanks for the invitation Thirsty Lion.  It's gutsy thing to open yourself up to folks who like to critisize restaurants online.  You've got it figured out.  Bravo!  And thanks for bringing a bit of Portland to the Sonoran Desert!",

They have a decent selection of beer, and a wine list for days (I don't drink wine, so I didn't read it.) The husband had a Moscow mule which was excellent and I had well deserved bloody Mary. I was disappointed that there were no olives in my drink, but quickly got over that because it tasted wonderful. Typical gastropub menu, but a lot of options for adventuresome foodie types and for the picky eater. The waitress was slow and inattentive, but we were not in a hurry. We would go back if we are ever out shopping and need adult libations...shop until you drop! Or drink :) Cheers!",

Sean (the manager) accommodated us in making sure we had all the items we needed even making sure we had the right 90's music pumping in the sound system. All the wait staff called us by name and made sure our guests were accommodated. Throughout the event, nothing but good vibes and things were said about our location (private bar and patio) and raving reviews of the food we chose. We originally booked in Tempe location but with the help of Deanna were able to get us in Scottsdale with the right vibe for our event and still be within our budget.  Nothing but good things were said about this event and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Thirsty Lion again for their scratch kitchen and event staff in making our 20 year High School reunion a success!",

The food and drinks are great and they've got a great happy hour. But every time I've gone, it seems not very busy and yet we end up feeling ignored. On more that one occasion, we've waited over 15 minutes before anyone came over to take our drink order. It's happened at the bar, in the dining area, and at a high top in the bar area. We certainly don't mind waiting if it's busy, however, that hasn't been the case for us. I don't know what the problem could be other than that's been made acceptable at this location.

If you are going to have them on the menu, someone should be trained how to make them. Our food, which we ordered off the reverse happy hr menu was equally as disappointing. We got pretzels and beer cheese-how can you mess that up? Turns out you can.   Maybe they have their good chefs and good bartenders on when it is busier...I will definitely not be going back.",

Guess Monday is not a great day to visit.",

The food: All the food we tried and share was phenomenal. Some things we all had were the ahi poke, steak salad, reuben, sliders, hummus and pretzel bites. All good came out hot and seemed to be fresh. Presentation was also wonderful!   The drinks: Great assortment of beers and craft drinks. If you go and it's hotter than 105 outside, you can get a very delicious mule for half off!   The service: The service is where this place really excels even over the drinks and food. Both the bartender the first day and the waiter the second day were extremely attentive to our needs and our drink glasses.   Although I only get to Arizona a few times a year which isn't enough for me, this place is well worth going out of your way for. The building and interior in and of itself is really cool looking!   Until next time Thirsty Lion!",

The food is \"okay\" and really isnt something to write home about, on top of being overpriced. Our waiter, (if you can call him that) seemed put out to even be there, and didnt even provide our table with napkins and silverware until 10 minutes before we left. Over all we were not impressed and wont be back anytime soon. Drinks were also served at a snails place and the beer was warm by the time it FINALLY arrived. For what my party paid, we should have had a much better experience. Sad.",

Working in restaurants I understand when there's a rush but there's no excuse for poor service. Our server Brittney was prompt at first with drinks and it went downhill afterwards. I'd have to say the best part was when she gave my husband lip about the beer he ordered when he knew it was the wrong beer and she says \"well that's the ticket that was on this beer\" never apologized about it and it took about 10 minutes for him to get the correct beet and again-never apologized. Not to mention he ordered the beer when we got our food and it came once we were all finished. I think we will stick to the Tempe location for better service and still amazing food.",

I had a grapefruit and basil martini {not on HH} and it was made with fresh grapefruit juice which made it a real winner. Well cocktails, select beer and wine, and a margarita are only $4!

She gave me the ice tea, no charge because we said we were going somewhere else. She ran to tell the manager what happened, as she saw us waiting to speak with the manager.  We received an apology and the manager said she would wait on us. Not even. There's no way Im waiting another 30+ mins for an order.   We will go to this location!!",

We were greeted immediately by the hostess and she walked us to the table we requested. Good start! After waiting for about 10 minutes, our server asked for our drink order, but then she immediately walked away from our table as I was beginning to place it! I have never had that happen, and it may be the most unprofessional thing that I've experienced while dining out. After she finished with whatever she became sidetracked with, we were ready to place our order, and once again she interrupted and told us to wait. By that point I was ready to leave. We decided to stay and hope the food and drinks made up for our experience with our server, but we were completely wrong. The experience was offensive until the very end to say the least.",

Never got our waters refill server out food and disappeared even tho we had no silverware. After 5 minutes of looking around I finally went up to the bar to ask for forks so we could eat our food. We asked our server for the check and some boxes when we finally saw her again 20 minutes later. She took her time for sure to finally return with boxes and our check. The food tasted amazing but I will not return. I don't go out to spend $100 on lunch to leave pissed off. Kaylin serving doesn't seem to be the right job for you.",

The past three times I have been to Thirsty Lion I've ordered the Smoked Turkey Club, it's so good and made panini style. I'll probably order it again next time. I do the side it is served with, I had a small side salad this time, but I have also had their fries and cole slaw. All are great!   Drinks are very good. I had two different martinis, a traditional gin to take the edge off from holiday shopping and then a pear martini for dessert.   It's a pretty large place and is really well done.  Also very comfortable. Even the bar stools are comfortable! There is an \"inside patio\" for people watching but there is also a regular patio off the bar as well.   Check out Thirsty Lion during your next trip to Fashion Square.   Enjoy!",

I loved the fact that the booths in the dinning area were huge and comfortable with the music being just right making this place perfect for a good conversation.The ambiance is cozy and feel good.The servers are friendly,food is fresh and you can select a bunch of options from their happy hour menu for $4-$6. We had the Pub Fries served with 3-peppercorn ranch dipping sauce $3.95 Crab & Seafood Cakes $5.95  (crab and salmon coated with panko bread crumbs served with chipotle aioli some marinated tomatoes and arugula).The cakes were good but i wish they had just Crab cakes. House margarita $4 pint of beer $4  The happy hour menu has a good variety of food options but the drinks are awfully limited. We also had the fish and chips(something i always order),they were served with fries and coleslaw. Overall a great place with free Valet.  Cheers!",

So the front line guy is the waiter, he is often supported by the busser.  These folks got it done on Friday.  The guys supporting them, the ones who get paid the most up-front: the cooks, failed the front line guys.  I don't know what happened, but for being only a half-full night the kitchen moved at an impeccably slow rate.  Put our orders in, and then we wait, and waited, and waited, getting a water refill periodically, being asked for drinks, getting an update on our food.  Our waiter finally brought our appetizer, the bacon wrapped prawns, hot to taste so I knew the food wasn't just resting on the shelf.  I split the herb encrusted mahi and jasmine rice...it was delicious and even hotter when it came.  Service was solid, back end staff needs a bit of work to keep the guys on the front line ability of customer retention.",

The only times I've have come have been to watch Indianapolis Colts games since for this season they are the \"official\" bar for the local group.They basically have \"reserve\"d the front bar tvs + speaker sound for our games [Sunday Ticket required or not]. During NFL season they open early around 9/930AM for the early East Coast games. Friends have told me their brunch is legit!   Food here isn't terribly British but can't be beat! Love their burgers + side salads for an entree but if you're wanting snacky-sh and happen to be dining during happy hour - that WONDERFUL kale salad + the garlic edamame! Their beer list can't be beat either - every time I'm at this location or Tempe it appears the beer list has changed [not a problem]. Service is great too whether you're sitting for 3 hours watching football or catching up with friends for a meal.",

We split the spicy burger with jalapenos, guac, pepperjack, etc - great as well - burger was juicy & cooked perfectly and tasted fresh - side of fries seemed fresh cut as well.  Finish off with a piece of starwberry/rubarb cheesecake - crazy light fluffy awesomeness!   Drinks were great for us too - Vino & cider (Plenty of beer options).  We will be back for sure!!",

That's when they told us the chefs were working hard to fulfill other bigger tables orders. I mean I could have gone elsewhere. Once food was on the table there were no plates or silverware, the girl who dropped it was like \"oh yeah, of course\" when I asked about silverware and plates lol. Yeah, I am not using my hands today. Anyway! First impression wasn't impressive. And first impression matters.",

The hostess friendly and attentive, my waiter friendly and accommodating, and the manager very attentive.   I ordered a margarita and the filet mignon with extra crispy fries and the slaw.  They were very accommodating of my request to change my side options. The slaw was just okay.  The fries were good and just how I liked them. The margarita was tasty.  Now the steak.   The steak has a great taste.  Flavored nicely. However the cook.  I asked for medium and the steak brought out was well done. I hesitated sending it back... I don't like to be fussy... but it was mignon and eating a mignon well done is simply ruining a good steak. I asked for it to be redone. They were very apologetic and accommodating.   They left me my sides and took back the steak and brought out another one a while later (when I was completely done with my sides).  The new steak was medium well to well again (they brought a second order of fries that I just couldn't eat).  Not cooked as asked again. This time I simply ate it... obviously the cook doesn't know how to temperature steaks.  The new cut was also not as good as the one originally sent (see pic). They offered me a dessert on the house which I declined, but still charged me for my drink (which was only 5 bucks).  I don't know.  Seemed tacky. Oh well.    While the service was great, and I might try this place for other things, I would stay away from the steaks!",

After being quickly seated I perused the menu and decided on the humus and veggie plate as an appetizer and the shrimp tacos as my entree. My eyes were bigger than my stomach though, as the appetizer was enough for a meal, but once the tacos and fixins came out... well I had to dig in! The food and service were great, and didn't break the bank either. I left stuffed and happy. Next time I'm in Scottsdale I will definitely stop in... you should too!",

Also they don't know how to make cheese sauce. It blows my mind that this place is still open especially based on how busy it was during what should have been a dinner rush.

We were seated right away both visits, but it took a while to be greeted by a server.  For my first visit, the server was trying a little too hard to upsell and that became annoying.  Otherwise, the service was good.  For the second visit, the server seemed to disappear a lot.  I had to get up to get my own utensils after the food was dropped off and the server was nowhere to be found.  Also, I had to ask for our bill.  Plates were cleared away after and I waited a good 10 minutes before asking the hostess for our bill.  When we got the bill the server set it on the table and told us to let her know if we needed the bill split and again was gone.  I again had to get up to ask for service.  The quality of the food was pretty average and the pricing was to be expected from a chain.  At least it provides another option...",

We went in for happy hour this afternoon, around 5:00 pm and waited and waited...no acknowledgment from our server (we were told that Lexi would be right with us).  15 or so minutes without even being offered a nod or a glass of water is not ok. We spoke to the hostess, who'd already forgotten us, and she apologized.    We will give them another chance because the food is good but the service must improve. If you can't handle tables when you're not terribly busy, what will the dinner rush be like?",

Only thing was, our server (Stephanie) was suuper weird. awkward. in a hurry. didnt seem to even wanna serve us. And only came to us like 2 times while we were there.  The food runner was more attentive to us than our server was.   Anyway. Yes food was delightful and tasty, but make sure you dont get sat in Stephanies area!",

I am super picky about my margaritas and this might be my favorite Margarita i've ever had! LOVE this place so much i had to finally write a review!",

    "text": "We decided to try somewhere new-ish for a late night snack and this location just opened up -perfect! We have been to the Tempe location before and were impressed with the late night food menu and and normal happy hour specials but that location was a tad far from home so when this location opened we were excited. I'm not sure if the specials are location specific or my bad memory but it seemed like the Tempe location has more food specials? & and a veggie sandwich on the late night menu? Anywho they had a few things we could nibble on -no worries. I got the spinach and artichoke dip and my beau got the chicken fingers. Mine was enough for 2-3 people and tasted industry standard -good but not wow and his food was pretty pitiful looking. A few stringy-dinky thin slices of chicken- not worth the price. I felt bad for him since I suggested we come here but maybe it was an off night?  On the plus side- the service was excellent -our waiter was very enthusiastic and friendly.   The prices for HH/late night are reasonable but will prolly not be back for normal food hours. -doesn't seems worth it -too pricey.  I love their patio - way better than yard house/kona/ztejas patio by far.  We'll prolly find ourselves back sometime but it's not going to be our go to place for HH & Reverse HH.",

Everything looked and tasted fresh, was served at the right temperature, and had inventive combinations of foods and seasonings. We had a Moscow Mule to drink, a Caesar salad, the spicy mac & cheese, and the fish and chips. I can't take anything too spicy, so I asked for the chipotle aioli on the side for the spicy mac & cheese. I stirred just a tiny bit of it into the entire dish and it was plenty spicy for me! Our server, Lindsey, stopped by our table several times to talk with us, and I was as amazed by her ability to hold plates in her arms for a long time as I was at her friendliness and knowledgeableness about the company.",

I liked the BBQ sauce they had on the side with it. Chicken has a lot of seasoning but still pretty tasty. Then we split the peppercorn bacon burger cooked medium rare. It was cooked perfectly with the right amount of pink in the middle. I also had the Tennessee honey lemonade which was pretty good as well.",

My kids did not. No drink included in the kids pricing. They do reverse happy hour 930pm to 12 seven days a week.  My son got the pizza and pork sliders.. Both pretty good. I got the California Rolls(tasted ok)  and the chicken tenders (very small, meat was tough, batter was super peppery, not impressed) Water doesn't taste filtered.  Only think I loved besides the Ambiance was the Orange Blossom Beer. Service was ok,but not great. Probably won't be back for food, Maybe drinks.  Too many good restaurants in Gilbert.

Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable (we had questions since it was our first visit). The NW Pub Burger was hands down one of the best burgers I have had in sometime. Looking forward to going back!",

    "text": "My friend and I both have birthdays in July and we came in with a birthday flyer for a free entree during the month of your birthday. We also brought two other friends and all ordered apps, beer, and an entree each. The apps were average, and the entrees were mediocre at best. But that was not the problem.  After asking for our check, we proceeded to wait 30 mins until going to the bar and asking for the check again (it was a Sunday evening). It FINALLY came and my friend received his free birthday entree. My entree however, was not taken off my check. I politely showed the manager my coupon and she proceeded to argue with me for 10 mins straight, saying that it was valid for only one person. I pointed out that the flyer did not say 'only one person', it said 'come in during your birthday month and receive a free entree'. She continued on her shaky argument until relentlessly and rudely giving me my free birthday entree.  Needless to say, Thirsty Lion has terrible service AND WILL RUIN YOUR BIRTHDAY DINNER. I cannot imagine the wait and the grief they will give you on one of their busy days.",

    "text": "Decided to splurge and try a bit of everything. Had the Bacon Wrapped Dates, which were phenomenal; as well as the Scotch Egg and Pretzel for appetizers. Then we had their Margarita, which was made with grapefruit. I must say that this was a welcomed change to an old friend I have grown fond of. I was so excited about their microbrewery that I decided to change up the pace and have a flight of all their dark beers. For $10 you can't beat it, and probably won't be able to finish them. To top it off we had their famous NW Burger which I think was perfect ending to a fabulous meal. The staff was attentive and very accommodating. This is my new favorite place when I fly into town. Move over Roaring Fork.",
