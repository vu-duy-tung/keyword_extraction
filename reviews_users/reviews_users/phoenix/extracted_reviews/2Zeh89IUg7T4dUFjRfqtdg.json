    "text": "There are a lot of places in Phoenix Metro where you can get a good Italian sub, but only a handful where you can score a great Italian sub. Guido's is one of them.  Their subs, hot or cold, are some of the best in the area. I say this tongue in cheek, mainly because if you're from New York or Philly you'll disagree with my 'great' assessment. But do try to keep in mind this is the desert.  Where we don't have decent breads unless the deli is buying local from MJ or Arizona Bread Company, which they typically don't. The cold cuts are Boar's heads and not imported.  And the tomatoes are desert tomatoes, not Jersey sweets.  So there IS a difference, you're right NY and Philly, but once you get off your high horse and figure out there aren't a whole lot of places to choose from here, you'll eat Guido's and you'll like it goddammit. Ughhh.    I visit here regularly to restock my fridge with fresh olives, imported provolone, and Margherita pepperoni, one of the few places that has it. They also have decent homemade biscotti and pizzelles. Their homemade sausage is tasty too. Not the best, just tasty.  If you often find yourself eating at any of the chain sub shops around town, give yourself a break from the insufferable shit they call 'Italian' and try Guido's.   Guido's. Where in light of everything, easier (and cheaper) than a trip to New York, Philly, or Atlantic City.",

    "text": "Background: I've had their food 3 separate times but finally made it in there for an on site visit on Saturday. (they deliver and have takeout).    Food: The first time I had their sandwich at a friends place it was a mozzarella and prosciutto conglomeration of epic amazing awesomeness.  Then when I found out the Chicago connection (as I'm from Chicago) even more cool points awarded.    Second time, I wanted to try their entrees, so I fired up the pesto gnocchi with shrimp and that too was delicious! The shrimp was fresh tasting and gnocchi cooked to perfection. Large portions too! There were like 8 shrimp!   Ambiance: Third time went in and fired up another prosciutto and mozzarella sammy and checked the place out. So it's setup like this.  Part store where you can buy all things Italian food, then a deli counter with all types of options (Italian meats, chicken salad, etc), then a counter where you order off menu for to go orders, and then also a sit down restaurant area with a server.  The got it covered!  They have a tv in there and it's totally casual.  I did see some white wine in a fridge that you could likely buy if you wanted to drink it there but didn't see red wine, but I'm sure it's there!    Service:  The service was great, the gentleman who took my order was very sociable and my sandwich came up very promptly.    Overall: Major thumbs up and a high five. If you are ever in the area I'd highly recommend this awesome place!",

This place has been busy serving customers for the past 28 years. I had no idea they'd been there that long. Geesh, they must be doing something right.   I've only tried a couple of things. By far, my favorite is their Italian sub. It's a freshly baked submarine roll absolutely stuffed with deli meats (salami and mortadella, pepperoni) and provolone cheese, then lettuce, tomato, onion, with a generous amount of Italian dressing poured over it. I know I should only order the half portion, but sometimes I just gotta go for the whole. Roll up your sleeves and get the napkins ready. You're in for a fantastic, messy, tasty treat.",

This really is a trip to Chicago hidden in a shopping center.   Upon entering we were enthusiastically greeted by the owner, who must have overheard us talking about getting an Italian Beef, and pitched us a turkey sub with fries special he had going on. I got the turkey sub, my husband got the Italian beef.  Service was outstanding. Our food was out within 10 minutes of ordering and our waitress was very attentive. The owner came and inspected our dishes after they were served and joked with us briefly.   Our only regret is we are only in town from the Midwest for one day and can't come back every single day for something different! We will make this a place we come back to every time we are out here now though!",

    "text": "Horrible service. Searched for some Italian delis in the valley. I wanted something I am accustomed to from back east and in the Midwest. Everything looked good to go online with this place so I headed out. Walked in and 3 different employees walked past us and not even a smile or can I help you. Granted, they seemed to be serving on the restaurant side, still it's a bad customer experience. Finally, walking back and forth the sandwich area and deli, different employees saw us and still didn't ask if we needed anything. I finally had to walk by the serving station and ask if we could et some help by the deli case. The woman said \"oh, you want something\"... So when she came to the deli we asked how much the mortadella was a pound and she just rattled off a price and that was it. We literally walked out.  This is a bummer that the service sucked because we were ready to buy about 5 different meats, cheese, olives, bread and cannoli shells along with some Pollyo and would have been return customers because the place looked great and quality was on point just looking at it. Price, doesn't matter in this equation because I will (as most will) pay for quality.  Please also keep in mind that this was not at dinner time, it was about 330 pm so perhaps they were on boarding the evening wait staff, but again, no excuse for not acknowledging people.  This bums me out more than anything because this place has the potential to be slam packed and it's not a wannabe Italian deli either, it's legit.  I will be back for another try, hopefully this was an off day.",

Just recently, we visited again and we were so DISGUSTED with how bad the service was that we didn't even stay and eat this time.  For example, the waitress never came to our table initially. We had to go the front of the restaurant to try and place an order. This did not work, as we were told to go back and sit down and wait some more. I must also say that as we were waiting in line, the owner, I  presume, ignored us and spoke with some customers behind us in line, putting their orders in immediately.   So, in the end, we waited a bit more at our table and then got up and left. Even though the service has tended to be slow and rather inattentive in the past, we have never experienced this level of rudeness before. We will not be back.",

We waited another 10 minutes to order. Then, we waited another 25 minutes for our food= 45 minutes!!! We ordered a seafood salad and an eggplant parm sandwhich!!! 2- 5 minutes total to prep these and the pkace was only about 1/2 full, maybe 6 tables of people with only 2 tables of us without food. The owner and manager were sitting in the back yapping and only 3 staff members working with 2 making food. When I inquired for the 2nd time where our food was, it came out. The salad for $13.99 was a smsll dinner salad in a large bowl apable of holding salad dor 4 people that was literally like a child's portion with 6 pieces of calamari on cut up lettuce with 3 thin pieces of yellow pepper pieces only, compared to one giant sized for  a little old lady sitting behind me. The \"whole\" large eggplant parm Sandwhich fir $10.99 was literally 2/3 the size of a subway footlong, hence about 8-9 in long.!! It had a 1- 2\" spec piece of eggplant on one half with a glob of cheese and a ton of sauce. The other half had a 3\" piece like the other. The bread was almost burnt too!! I complained about the salad and they took it back and added about a 1/2 cup of Mir salad and nothing else! When the sandwhich came out just after I complained about that too. The waiter said he would have the mgr/owner come over and did nothing else! Over 5 minutes went buy ad the mgr was talking with a staff member and didn't come over. My wife and I walked out without eating spending almost an hour total in this place. Talk about the worst service, food and atmosphere. The could care less!!! Now, we will tell the 100's of people we know which will turn into 1000's in our in our social circles not to go there nor do business with them. They hould be ashamed!!! They deserve to go out of business!!!",

The walls are covered with fun decor and newspaper articles while any available surface space offers baked goods, t-shirts, cookies, and snacks. The best part about this place was the server. Robbie was no doubt the most pleasant server I've had in YEARS and I eat out all the time. He accommodated several special requests and was friendly & funny without being over-the-top or annoying. He didn't even seem irritated when my boyfriend and I started spatting across the table. Seriously Robbie, I would open a restaurant myself just to hire you. I guess I should also mention that the food was great! I will definitely be back the next time my boyfriend and I feel like fighting over some good food.",

    "text": "Short Story-  Italian Grocery Store, Deli and Market - Very Good   Italian Hoagie - above average and very good   House made hot Italian sausage sandwich- ok would have been very good if sausage wasn't overcooked. Peppers were cooked nicely and bread was good. Fresh basil was a nice touch.  Broasted Chicken- Unseasoned, dry meat. Horrible. Came with tasty potatoes and an average salad and pedestrian garlic toast.  Service- above average  Restroom- NONE so don't even think about refills.  Additional Notes-  Broasted chicken is suppose to be a juicier chicken with a crispy exterior that's more healthy than deep fried chicken. Broasted Chicken is made by a pressure cooker/fryer. The chicken is suppose to be marinated first and then battered. I don't know what was done here but it seemed like chicken out of the freezer that got thrown in a microwave, dipped in flour without seasoning. As the chicken sat on my plate it continued to dry even more. Maybe the regular crew wasn't on and I got the newbie cook or dishwasher filling in to prepare food.  I am generously averaging this review to a positive three stars because overall it was mostly positive and just a bad day for broasted chicken.",

It's like I got on a plane and flew back east. It is truly a Deli where you can buy all kinds of meats and cheeses, fresh Mozzarella made in house, they cure their own meats, and in the middle of the deli they put tables and booths. This is a full Italian Restaurant. The vibe is amazing. There is a hustle and bustle of the place that is only found back east. The staff are very friendly, and the service was perfect. Some wrote about long waits for food. All I can say is I did not experience this and food was coming fast and furious to the other tables as well. I had Veal Parmesan. Once in a while I'll order it hoping to find a place that can match what I would get back east. I'm alway disappointed, well until now. They hit the bullseye. The veal was tender, but not hammered down  as thin as a piece of paper. This veal was hammered and tenderized, but left thick enough that it had a great mouth feel. It was a large veal cutlet, lightly breaded, cooked perfectly. The spaghetti you get with it was perfectly cooked al dente, and the sauce was delicious. Coming with a salad and garlic bread, it was really enough for two, but I'd have to chop your hand off it you tried to take some. I finished the whole thing. My wife had Spaghetti in white clam sauce. It also was perfectly cooked, and tasted great. We are definitely coming back, and if you haven't gone here, and love home style old school Italian, you need to go. It's worth any length of drive.",

The wings and calamari are our favorite appetizers on the menu. Anything on the menu is excellent from the best ceasar salad, the chicken parm sub, spaghetti and meatballs, are all some of our all time favorite entree's. Just tried the cannoli for the first time yesterday and it was probably the best cannoli I've ever had. One of the best restaurants in the valley.",

    "text": "I saw this restaurant/deli highlighted on 'Check Please! Arizona' and was compelled to come for dinner with my very good friend. It is a spacious deli with several tables available where servers take care of your order. When you walk in you are welcomed by the Italian grocery on the right and the deli counter on your left. If you're ordering to go, you walk straight up the the counter to place your order - we weren't sure of the protocol, so went up to order when we met Joe Guido himself and learned that for dinner service you seat yourself. Joe's voice is just as delicious in person as it was in the interview on 'Check Please! Arizona!' :). We were there relatively early on a Saturday (around 6pm) so found a table after a few min and the line formed out the door.   We ordered the antipasto misto appetizer, chicken piccata, chicken marsala and 2 pieces of breasted chicken. Joe treated us each to a cannoli. The antipasto plate was delicious - definitely good for sharing. The chicken piccata was very good - I subbed vegetables for pasta and my friend had the chicken marsala which was generously portioned - she could only manage half. I really enjoyed the belated chicken leg...so crispy and flavorful on the outside and juicy on the inside. Neither of us had room for cannoli, so that will be breakfast!  We'll definitely be back.",

The last chicken parmesan I had here was pretty epic, but now they are breading small strips of chicken (not a full cutlet) and dumping it on their bread with not enough cheese and too big of a roll. They are generous with the parsley. Also, they need to find cooks who understand English better or have someone American taking my order. I clearly said I want half a sandwich to the Mexican cook, yet I got a full sandwich instead. Since I thought it would be a good hero I shook it off, but guess what, the joke was on me in the end.",

Guidos gives you the genuine Italian deli feel you wouldn't expect in AZ and their top notch Italian eats transport you.  Haven't had a chance to try everything on the menu, but what I can say is everything I have had is perfection!  The servings are large and the prices are fair.  Also, don't forget dessert, they have some genuine Spumoni and decadent cannolis that'll have you rolling out the door.  Bon appetit!",

For example, we had to ask for plates for our starter item, which was brought out without any forks or knives. She made three separate trips back and forth from our table just for the starter.  Before taking our drink orders she took drink orders from a table which was seated after us.  It was very noticeable.  I'm not sure if the service follies were intentional or just because she wasn't a good server.  She was outwardly nice - just not efficient.       I like that there are some authentic grocery items available for purchase as well.  Generally a good place.  Like the rating says, my overall experience was \"A-OK.\"",

Everyone in our group enjoyed their sandwich as well, but they were so big that we all ended up having leftovers for lunch the following day.

My husband had the veal piccata which he said was burned and not tender, and the pasta side was not cooked and the sauce was bland. My daughter had the linguine with shrimp and was disappointed the shrimp was not grilled, but deep fried (this should be noted in the description).

    "text": "It was the first time I tried this Italian deli.  Since it is holiday time I am always looking for an Italian store where I can buy groceries to prepare Italian meals.  I bought Pastosa frozen ravioli, sausage and cookies.  When I opened the box of ravioli many of them were cracked meaning they were old!  It was late Sunday evening the 17th of Dec.  I was disgusted but anxious to get a meal on the table.  I heard Pastosa pasta is very well respected in Brooklyn and NJ.  Having Italian roots I was excited to taste them.  Most of them opened up and the filling poured out.  We scraped up what we could.  I am a teacher and it was a busy week for me.  I finally had a chance to bring in the receipt with the box of empty ravioli.  The Asian mgr or owner came out and asked me what the date was on the receipt, how I cooked them and gave me the third degree.  All I wanted was to get another box of ravioli. She said I should have called her right away or taken a picture, therefore I get no money back and no exchange. Would I have driven all the way to Scottsdale to complain about something that didn't happen?  Fact is they were old and she didn't want to admit it.  Rude and poor customer service, I'll never set foot in that place again.  Reminds me of how they treat customers who complain in Hong Kong.  I'm going to write the pasta company to complain.",

Very busy, but they put two tables together in a couple minutes and we were seated. Immediately someone had to use the bathroom and I remembered a review that said they did not have one. That is NOT correct, they have bathrooms. So a busy restaurant with a table of 7 and we all wanted to try something, but wanted changes to almost everything. This was no problem and everything we ordered came out fairly quickly and correctly. Guido delivered some of the dishes and wanted to know where we were putting everything. Told him we wanted to try everything and we would do it family style. He even offered to split them in the kitchen but we just had him put everything in the middle of the table. We had pasta with homemade sausage, salads, pizza, and broasted chicken. Everything was very good. Not the best pizza in the valley but in the top 10. Sausage was perfect. For desert, the huge chocolate cake and cannoli's (pistachio and chocolate chip). A small fight broke out at the end for who was going to get the last bites. Service was great. Very friendly. We will be back. Guido came outside when we left and asked how everything was and to thank us for coming in. Nice touch.",

I have not had a single complaint, or been disappointed even once.  Their sandwiches, particularly the eggplant parm and the chicken parm are incredible.  Amazing crusty bread with a huge portion, they don't skimp.  Their sauce is outstanding as well. The meatballs are phenomenal. I am also a fan of their minestrone soup.  I have gone there just for that.  its hearty, needs absolutely nothing sprinkled on or added to it.  And they are consistent.  Always good, every time.  I am actually salivating as I type this review LOL.  Seriously though, if you haven't tried it, please go.  It's a casual, friendly environment, and the food is outstanding, I don't care who you are, Italian or not.

It's a little loud but that's one of the things I love about it. Run by a family that puts their all into, what more could you ask for. The subs are my favorite but I haven't had anything here I didn't like. Makes me miss Chicago, but luckily I have this place to come to. Don't miss out on this gem!",

The manager Manny greeted me warmly and offered me their featured wine. He made recommendations and told me some history of the restaurant. I ordered mostaccioli al forno with meatballs! It comes with a nice dinner salad with their homemade Italian dressing. Everything was delicious! The pasta is very filling. Made with ricotta cheese and topped with mozzarella and I added meatballs. My whole experience was just perfect and I never even felt like I was dining alone because the service was so friendly! I will be making this my new Italian spot!",

I can't say enough about how great the food is here. I used to go way more often when I lived closer, but I still try to get back whenever I can.   It's a nice little place with indoor and outdoor seating, not enough to be crazy, just enough to fill the place up right. They are quick enough for a business lunch and I promise if you take a client here, they will thank you and want to bring people back.   The owner is ALWAYS there, and is always watching over the place, something I find very admirable and effective. While I was there, I watched him walking through the place straightening out, a big plus for me.   The prices are in line with a sub shop of much lesser quality so for the same money you can get real Italian stuff :) Definitely worth stopping in if you like good food and laid back atmosphere.",

    "text": "I was very excited about visiting Guido's. Been looking for a good Italian sub shop that cranks out a nice chicken parm sub. I went to Guido's with my wife and four year old daughter. The atmosphere was what I expected for an Italian market. The selection of items for sale was also interesting. As you wait for your food you can peruse the market area to kill time. The service was very attentive and the waitress was sweet. My wife ordered the fried calamari and she said it was delicious. So good even my four year old ate some. My daughter had a bowl of pasta with butter and cheese. Not rocket science at all. I ordered my longtime craved chicken parm sub. I was somewhat satisfied but the sauce was a little generic and the two pieces of chicken were so small they did not even fill the bread up. I would say overall my dish was okay. I would give them a try again as the menu is varied and I would give another dish a shot. The prices seemed very fair to me. I wish I could give them four stars but just not good enough the first time around. I will keep an open mind for next time and maybe find another star. Good appetite to you all!",

    "text": "This place made me sangry (sad + angry). I really wanted to like it as an Italian who works right around the corner.   Went here with my work team for lunch on a Friday and the service was so slow I missed my regular after-lunch meeting with my boss. Not cool! Not only did the food take forever to come out, paying the bill felt like it took just as long as eating. As we were wrapping up, I let the waitress know we were in a hurry, but it was at least 10 minutes until we got our check. I walked up to the counter area to ask her about it, and it was clear there was some confusion about our bill and what we ordered. Probably because one in our party was served well before everyone else (probably someone else's pasta), one who ordered chicken for her pasta never got it, and other general poor service related issues. She asked me to sit back down and said she'd bring it out to us, so I sat for countless minutes more until I eventually went up to her again only to have her tell me she thought she'd dropped it off already and had it in her apron pocket. OMG was I seeing red by that time.   If the food had at least been good, I might have been in a better mood,... but out of the six of us not ONE of us enjoyed the meal. The food was mediocre - like my reheated manicotti that seemed like a frozen Marie Callender's someone heated in the microwave. The garlic bread was rock hard and only edible after soaking it in red sauce for a few minutes to soften it out of desperation because the rest of our food was terrible.  Looking back at the reviews, perhaps sandwiches to-go might be alright, but I would never repeat our pasta eat-in experience ever again.",

    "text": "I was wandering around the shopping center at Shea and Scottsdale Road at lunch trying to decide what to eat.  I noticed a little Italian Deli, and was amazed  - it was before noon and the placed was packed.  I went in and before I looked at the menu, I wandered around looking at the diners and their plates.  The diners were very mixed - professionals,  construction workers, couples, singles, and groups. They all seemed to have something different, and they all seemed to be enjoying what they were eating.    So I decided to give it a try.  The person who took my order spoke heavily accented Italian, but I managed to convey what I wanted, which was really simple - an Italian Sub with salami, Mortadella, Pepperoni & Provolone.  It was packed with onions, tomatoes, and lettuce, and drenched in sub oil.  It was great, delicious - made me aware of what I had been missing all my life - and more than filled me up.  My only disappointment was that I was full - I wanted to try everything on their menu, because everything looked so tempting.  But they are close to my home, so I'm sure it will become my lunchtime favorite.  I only gave them 4 stars, since I only had the sandwich.  But I will update as I visit them again and try their complete menu, which also includes salads, pasta, pizza, and different kinds of subs.",

I had never had fries like these...they are incredible.  They finish the sandwich off in the oven so the bread is lightly crunchy when it comes out.  I did get a sandwich that was a little overdone for my taste once, and didn't notice it until after I had left with my to go order so keep an eye on that.  I think the food quality may suffer a bit when the owner isn't working.   The Calzones are huge and taste pretty good.   The Cannoli from their deli are a favorite in our office.",

That being said, I sure would like to.    Meatballz was closed again and we all needed our fix.  Guido's hit the spot with their italian beef sandwich that was cheesey, juicy and on some of the best crusty roll I've had in a while.  On the downside, the beef was pretty tough, so I'll probably have to go back to test it out again.  Spaghetti and meatballs had a well made gravy and meatballs that looked pretty good, and my son said were good, but he wouldn't even let me have a tiny taste.  Never seen him mop up sauce with garlic bread before, but he took it up like a pro.  They sell fresh pasta, pre-made entrees and salads, meats, italian ice and spumoni and the sought out San Marzano tomatoes.  The inventory is presented really well - not a speck of dust to be found on any can or shelf, fresh looking, well stocked and orderly.  Guido's has the potential for five stars if everything tastes as good as it looks.  Looks like a few more visits are in order.",

As I approached the front door I was greeted with a hand written note indicating the card machine was down and they were only accepting cash - but that didn't deter me. Came with two buddies and we decided to get a table close to the deli case which allowed for some good people watching and really helped to soak in the ambiance. It has the Italian deli feel to it; you know...the one with friendly people, all kinds of products you can't get at the grocery store, the finest quality cold cuts and cheese, homemade bread, and freezers packed with ice cream and pastas. We all opted for sandwiches; and the full size. Holy smokes were they massive and to be honest us full grown men could have gotten by on half a sandwich each. I chose the meatball marinara as I think it's a good way to judge a place - you get a feel for their sauce and the meat they use. The sauce was just a tiny bit on the sweet side for me but I have to say it's one of the best I have ever had. Meatballs were juicy and of quality ingredients. Both the sauce and meatballs were simply yet super complex in terms of taste. The bread was soft and light on the inside but crispy on the outside - truly a work of art. Topped off with some provolone cheese and a side of sauce for dipping was the finishing touches of a masterpiece. Great people, even better food...what else could you ask for. I will be back.",

We also ordered pasta primavera with marinara sauce and it was excellent as well. Meals. Amen with nice fresh salads and garlic bread. All terrific! We got a few Italian pastries for dessert- YUM!! Great place that I always visit when I visit Scottsdale. If you haven't been here, you need to get here!",

    "text": "Guido's has recently become my go-to for fresh cookies, biscotti, and other treats, but I finally decided to sit down and take part in their restaurant experience.   It's really a cute little diner, and other than being a restaurant, it also is an entire Italian grocery store. They have all the Italian cooking ingredients you would need along with the cookies, gelato, and even clothing that you can buy. Plus, the place is all one room, so you can see the chefs cooking right in front of you. It all really adds to the ambiance as if it was something you would see on Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives.   When we walked in, we were immediately seated, even though the restaurant was quite busy. The service was friendly and attentive, too. We started off ordering the calamari appetizer that was delicious. I was pleasantly surprised to find that the calamari was not tough at all, which can be a problem for Arizona restaurants. We received the calamari first, but it was a little slow getting out the rest of the orders (I don't really blame them, though, since it was quite busy with customers and take-out orders). I ordered the pesto ravioli while my friends ordered chicken piccata and soup. It was all good, home style food, but too heavy for my taste. The best thing we tried was their red sauce spaghetti that comes with the chicken, but I was underwhelmed by my dish. It was not only very heavy, but was a \"one-note\" kind of dish.   Overall, they have a good range of Italian food that would be great for a night out, but nothing that would make me want to sit down in their restaurant again soon. For now I'll just have to stick with their yummy treats.",

A great deli that serves meals on the other side of the house.  They also have a small but great selection of condiments for cooking and other items to make a great dinner at home as well.  We had the Pastrami sandwich and of course the broasted chicken.  First off, the service was terrific.  Our server was great.  He was friendly, knowledgeable and on top of everything!!  The bang for the buck is pretty good here.  The Broasted Chicken platter which is 4 pieces of awesome broasted chicken, salad, great toasted garlic bread and three large pieces of broasted potatoes.    The flavor on all the items was on point and it was great to see the QA is still in tact and the food was just terrific.  All that food for just $14.    The Pastrami Sandwich was also very good and tasty and served on a nicely toasted roll.  I could not find one thing wrong with our visit.  The food was superb, the service was awesome and the bang for the buck was perfect.  We finished off our dinner with their chocolate cake and three servings of their Gelato.  White Chocolate, Rasberry (WOW!!!!) and Pistachio.  I thought the serving was going to be normal but each serving was the size of a baseball.  LOL!!!!  It was funny as I could not eat all of this and had much to share with everyone.  It is absolutely worth trying.  The cake was light and not dense with good consistency and flavor and the Gelato was just terrific.    Once again, I highly recommend going to Guido's!!!!",

Staff was nice, it wasn't slammed busy but there were several customers and we didn't have any issues with service as I have read on some of the reviews.  I feel kinda bad basing my review on a sandwich, but it's what I ordered. I ordered a hot pastrami sandwich a half, the bread was crispy, fresh and soft inside. It was topped with lettuce, two slices of tomato and onions with italian dressing mayo and mustard. It's enough to get full of off, does it scream something special... Not in my opinion.  My husband ordered the Italian sausage it was an encased sausage topped with marinara sauce and cheese, onions and green peppers, he ordered a whole and he just said it was ok, at 12 bucks he said he coulda ordered something better. We also so ordered a side of fries, nothing special there either.  I wouldn't say it's a terrible place, I'd say a little pricey, for just ok food. It's not something I'd crave or run to, don't even think we would go back.",

    "text": "PLEASE READ AND SEE PHOTOS OF PAST REVIEWS  AS TO SAVE YOU FROM BEING SCAMED CHICAGO STYLE. Three of us went to Guido's and ordered three dishes one of the dishes was a prosciutto sandwich . The prosciutto  had a taste of a refrigerator  I can't really explain it but it wasn't good. We asked the server to take it back . Just a moment later short  a Hispanic woman showed up with a slab of prosciutto and  proceeded to tell us that she just opened the slab and she was sorry but she would have to charge us for the sandwich in  a very nasty and aggressive way.  We told her that it had a weird taste and we would be happy to pay for the rest of the meal but not for that sandwich. The lady said that if we don't pay for the sandwich also she would call the police we agreed and asked her to call the police. The police showed up and explain to us that the lady was ready to file charges for theft of services and that they could do nothing if we wouldn't pay for the sandwich we would be arrested. We told the police that we did not eat the sandwich we took one bite and it was bad and returned it . We had no choice and we paid by credit card and wrote on the receipt that we intended to dispute the charge for that bad tasting prosciutto sandwich. The idea that a business would act in such a manner to regular customers that are only guilty of returning a sandwich that tasted bad And were forced to pay for  it Under the threat of being arrested is literally The meaning of insanity. If you plan to visit Guido's I strongly suggest you not return any dish even if it's spoiled or bad or you're going to face the possibility of being arrested if you refuse to pay for the bad smelling prosciutto sandwich.",

    "text": "Been coming into Guido's since the late 80's. This ain't Chi-town or NY or Philly, so get over it. It's Scottsdale and its the best Chicago/Italian deli this side of the Illinois river. I haven't found another deli this side of town that is better.  Food is great. I've eaten everything on the menu. All fresh. Some things they make the night before but I can tell you for a fact that food does not hang around here for more than 24 hours.   I actually like the tuna sub. Of course, the bread makes the sammy. I always buy a loaf and some meatballs from the deli to make a pasta dinner for the family.  I'm not going to be pretentious and make recommendations. Go for yourself and see.  Oh, and the owner always says goodbye to me when I get up and leave.  Yea, that's a 5 STAR act in my book.  BADDABING!",

The broasted potatoes were boring fried potatoes.  The cole slaw has garlic it in and actually made me throw up which of course is not a good sign.  The chicken I expected juicy mouth watering juicy, which I did not get. it was dry, dry dry. The chicken is better at Costco and way less expensive.  I had to put apple sauce on my chicken to make it moist.  I would tell Guido to stick to one thing which you do good and avoid all the rest as they also sell very high priced pasta dishes, which I have not tried as they are very high priced even for Scottsdale.  The chicken dinner was also suppose to come with bread and butter and it did not it came with very dried out garlic bread.  If they had been honest and said it comes with garlic bread I would have asked for just bread and butter as I do not like garlic bread.",

    "text": "Worst experience! We have been to this restaurant a few times and while we love the food and atmosphere, the lack of customer service and class that the owner/manager showed to us tonight was absolutely inexcusable. After we ordered our food, the waitress told us that their credit card machine was down but that it should be fixed soon. After we ate our meal, we were presented with the check without a word about the machine. We figured it got fixed. When the waitress brought our credit card back to our table she said that the machine was still down. She told us we had to leave the restaurant and find an ATM that we could use, then come back to pay cash. I told her that I really didn't want to have to do that, considering we had a small child with us. I offered to pay by check. She checked with the owner/manager and he said no. She apologized to us and said that she would have taken the check if it were up to her. All of a sudden the owner/manager comes to our table and starts yelling about the situation. He said that he was \"stuck\" and that there was nothing he could do about it. I offered again to pay by check but he told me that there was \"no way\" he could take that. I said \"so you will run the risk of all these people leaving to go get money instead of offering an alternative way to pay, such as a check?\" Then he started blabbering about God or something like that. I also told him that we will get charged a fee to pull out of the nearest ATM, then he said \"well how much can that fee be? Here take a couple bucks off the bill\" I said \"forget it, don't bother\" He was throwing his arms up in the air and he was very loud, which was completely embarrassing to us. This was a Saturday night around 7pm, and it was very crowded. My small child saw that the man was yelling at me so she started crying, saying \"mommy!\" We could have made an even bigger scene since we did nothing wrong and were being treated so poorly, but we chose the high road. Needless to say, we left to find cash and brought it back. We will never return there again and I will be sharing this experience with our friends and family. So disappointing.",

    "text": "Been coming to Guido's since we moved to Scottsdale in 1997.  Back then there was much more family running the place.  The only 2 people I recognize now are the cook (always the same dude) and Guido.  Of all the reviews I read on Guido's (I didn't read them all, admittedly), I'm shocked more people didn't try the Broasted Chicken.  Not \"fried\" chicken, but a close cousin and absolutely terrific.  Juicy, crispy and darn good.  Comes with 3 huge Broasted potato wedges and cold slaw.  Let's talk about the cold slaw:  BEST in the state.  Has some kind of oniony taste that just knocks it out of the park.  Sounds strange, but sometimes I crave the cold slaw more than the chicken!   Wings are solid.  Pizza's OK (I'm from Brooklyn and a huge pizza snob, so nothing in AZ is going to work for me).  Hot Sandwiches are great.  Chicken Parm and Meatball sub are favorites of my teenage sons.  Great selection of beverages.  Interesting beer choices from the help-yourself-refridgerator in the front.  Prices are decent.  Service is spotty, but the kitchen is right in front of you and very open so if things aren't going well, you can walk right up to the cook and tell him.  Also, Guido is always there, so...  Only real disappointment are the frozen \"Italian Ices\" that sit in a freezer near the front of the place.  They are pre-packaged and frozen.  Tempting to look at, but a poor immitation of the real thing.   If you're headed to the Harkins Shea 14 movie heater or the Big League Dugout for your baseball gear stop in.  With the lack of good Italian places in AZ, this one's worth checking out.",

I explained to him that's not what it says on the internet and I even show him the price listed on the internet. He says well that's not right and says I have to pay for their mistake of them not listing the right price on their menu! And then he hands me a paper menu and says see it says on here! Most people use technology and the internet today! Regardless of the error, a $4 dollar increase is not worth their sandwiches.

    "text": "One Saturday, we were looking for Panettone to give as a gift to one of our Italian friends. Panettone is an Italian Sweet Bread Loaf that seems to disappear in your hands after you take the first bite. At least, that's how it is for me.  I was informed that they stocked this particular bread here by the dozens, which meant that we didn't have to keep driving around town looking for it.  However, since I was here around lunch time, we decided to dine here. It is a Deli after all. One of this particular Deli's signature dishes is their Broasted Chicken. It's not an Italian dish, but it's made by Italians from Chicago.   The moment you walk in this place, you will notice just how well maintained and clean this place is. One of the ladies that worked there kept making sure that the place was swept and mopped continually. I wish our tile floors were as gleaming as these on a continual basis.  We sat down in one of the booths, and not only did she do the cleaning. She also was our server! Imagine that!  I ordered the Broasted Chicken, and my wife ordered the Spaghetti Carbonara with a side of meatball. For appetizers, we ordered side salad, and some garlic bread.  The salad as okay, and so was the garlic bread. There was nothing special there.  However, the Broasted Chicken was stupendous. The skin was very crispy, but it was neither overdone nor overly saturated with flour. The meat inside was very tender and juicy. The combination of both was heaven.  I regretted having ordered the smaller portion.   My wife's spaghetti had such a wonderful sauce. And the meatball was huge and absolutely magnificent.  After we were thoroughly satisfied with our meals, we went to pay. As we were leaving, we kept wondering if we were forgetting something. After hopping on the 101 Southbound, we soon realized what we had forgotten - the Panettone!",

It's an unassuming Italian deli and restaurant. We walk in and not sure what to do cause there's no hostess but one of the servers just tell us to find a table. Cool. They basically have two server handling all the tables inside and outside.   Took a little while but our server came and brought us our drinks. I ordered the Italian combo which is Italian Beef with homemade sausage and grilled onions and peppers with melted mozzarella. This was really good. They give you a cup of sauce to make it even more moist. The bread is fresh too. So good. The more sauce I put on the more I loved it. So good. My wife want to try my sandwich and she couldn't put it down. She loved it too.   My wife ordered her usual the meatball sandwich which happens to be one of my favorites too. Huge meatballs with Marinera sauce with melted mozzarella. I knew I could share with her and boy was it good. Meatballs were really good and loved the sauce. My wife was raving about the bun. So fresh and soft. We both really liked it a lot.   I decided to get a half an order of boasted fries. These were fresh and really good. I know I'm not supposed to eat a lot but so dang good. Not crispy but just right. No complaints here  So this place has an Italian deli with Italian dessert in the freezer too plus a restaurant. Very busy. Very open and reminds me a lot of DeFalco's but less cramped. Very relaxed atmosphere were you can enjoy your Italian meal. The food is spot on. Excellent. The service is pretty good. It's just not one of those place you want to rush to get in and out in a hurry. Enjoy the food. Enjoy the atmosphere. It's really good.   The question is will I be back. Of course I will. My wife even asked me what days they are open and I know she loves it too. Can't wait to try more. I just love Italian food",

We had the salami caprese sandwich and the Italian sub. The bread is that perfect mix of crusty and chewy that you are looking for and the fillings are on point.   They were also incredibly kind to my 1 year old daughter. We ordered her a meatball and they offered to bring it out first without us even having to prompt them. Our waiter let us know how long things would take so we made sure to order things that came out quickly. Perfect situation for parents of a toddler!!  Overall I say get yourself over here before Triple D shows up and this place gets swamped!",

I had a taste for fried chicken and they said the broasted chicken at Guido's is one of the best.  They were right.  It was sooooo good.  Perfectly cooked and juicy.  My daughter-in-law and I shared the large broasted chicken dinner.  It is served with a broasted potato which was perfect and cole slaw or a salad.  The cole slaw was just to my taste.  My son had the eggplant parmesan sandwich.  It was gigantic and he said their parm is the best he has tasted.  We also had calamari for an appetizer.  The calamari is always great and the marinara is the best.  The restaurant gave us a pistachio cannoli for my birthday and that was wonderful.  So delicious.  If you haven't tried Guido's go there.",

Do I find a seat, do I wait at the door where the menu stand is, do I approach the register/counter?  However, the food was phenomenal. I ordered the fried mozzarella cheese sticks, and they were very delicious with a thick-battered crust. The basil and the flavor of the marinara sauce were nice additions. I also had a pepperoni, sausage, and cheese calzone, which in my opinion was one of the better calzones I've had. Not too bready. Get ranch with it because their ranch is also very tasty.

I was also pretty impressed at how quickly they made my takeout order given the crowd in there.    I'd recommend calling ahead to place takeout orders to avoid waits.  Another pro tip:  the large menu above the grill doesn't have all of their items listed so, go to the cashier and grab a paper menu - it has everything on it.  Verdict:  highly recommend.  I'll definitely be back.",

We ordered a sausage and peppers large sandwich and an eggplant large sandwich with 2 sodas. We got up and walked around to see all of the items they sold in the rest of the store. . While the restaurant section menu prices are more in line to being reasonable a large homemade excellent fresh made sausage is $5.99 a lb. about 3/4 of one sausage. You decide. Our sausage and peppers hero was excellent and the toasted bread perfectly crunchy and the red sauce just right. The price was excellent for the large sandwich.. The eggplant sandwich was also excellent. We took home a meat ball sandwich which was very nice but not as good as Casanova Brothers sandwiches in GILBERT. They are #1. I definitely give GUIDOS #2 and when in SCOTTSDALE mall it's a short ride to Shea Blvd for some delicious sandwiches at reasonable prices. 3 large sandwiches a coke and ginger ale plus tax $41.00 and we had enough for a 2nd dinner the next night and a half  and a little more! Very nice atmosphere and Maria was a pleasant server!",

After flying all night and morning I was starving and found the shopping center Guido's was located in and went right in.  Old school Italian deli I have encountered on my mainland trips and was very happy.  Starving I ordered a half Chicago special with Italian beef and sausage, a whole Italian combo and a Greek salad to go.  Ran over to Safeway next door to get a six pack of craft beer.  Got back to the hotel and had a feast.  The next day I was planning on eating with some folks but fell through.  Tried to get a reservation on my own, but too late to book any thing and landed up at Guido's again.  Had the Veal Piccata, a small Guido's combo pizza and some desert cookies.  Back to the hotel to polish off the meal with the left over beer.  Fantastic, nothing like it here in Hawaii.  Two days later, leaving for the airport, I swung by to pick up two sandwiches for the long flights back to Honolulu and cookies for my family.  Sandwiches were the Italian combo and the cappicola/salami.  Great homemade Italian cookies, also.  All in all, no better place to find Italian food.  Real old school and family run to boot.  Owner, Joe Guido is there all the time I was there and is a really friendly to all his customers, new and old.",

    "text": "Didn't feel like cooking Sunday night. The assembled horde were hungry. Decided to order Italian and have it delivered from Guido's. Then, later that week, we all wanted to watch the CWS-NYY game and I had a hankering for eggplant parmigiana  Sunday, we ordered a margharita pizza, sausage pizza, garlic bread w melted mozzarella and marinara and cheesecake for all. The second time, we ordered eggplant parmigiana, antipasto, fried calamari w marinara, a couple of subs and cheesecake for all.  Okay, for starters, I understand that any restaurant-delivered food is not gonna be as fresh as it would be in their dining room. That said, the food from Guido's was pretty good on that score. The delivered food was reasonably warm or reasonably cold depending on the item. The spaghetti accompanying the eggplant was al dente.  Other than the calamari -- it was over-breaded, soft and overdone -- everyone was delighted with their dinner. Except me. But, that's what I get for ordering seafood in Arizona. The pizzas were warm, but a little light on the sausage topping.   The cheesecake was especially good, a nice-sized portion, reminiscent of NY cheesecake. The filling was creamy without being too heavy. Guido's cheesecake has a very thin graham cracker crust.   Be warned: there is an 18% service charge for orders delivered. If this food was served in their dining room, I'd knock them down a star. But, as for delivered pizza/italian food, this is about as good as it gets.",

The person at the counter was friendly and informative, and helped with suggestions. They have an amazing menu of Italian cuisine, and they also have frozen, fresh and Italian product market items you can purchase to take home. I truly recommend them if you are around Shea and Scottsdale road for a great lunch or dinner!",

I used to stop in for quick sandwiches all the time -- you'd walk up to the counter, order a sandwich to go, and the very efficient guys behind the counter would have you walking out with a great sub in just a few minutes.  For the last year, though, it's table service.  Same good food, but slower and more expensive.  An Italian sub (no side) and a coke is now $14 with a 20% tip. Sure it's good, but that's not something I'm going to do every day.",

    "text": "This place is a hidden gem! It's been in AZ since 1980 and I only learned of it within the last few years. It's a combination of italian deli and sit-down restaurant. Surprisingly, the pizza wasn't very good, but they offer broasted chicken and broasted fish with broasted potato wedges or broasted fries and it is amazingly and consistently delicious. We drive from Glendale to eat here and then drive back home - it is so worth it. We've had broasted chicken at other places but we've never seen anyone else offer broasted fish. It's like thick nuggets of cod in a light batter and it is so good (comes with coleslaw, chicken meal comes with salad or coleslaw).  They serve you hot garlic bread in a basket that is often made from Italian bread, French bread and even a sesame French bread, baked on premises!  We've never had to wait to be seated and its one reason my wife and I do NOT like to go out to eat on a Friday or Saturday night in the Phoenix metropolitan area, where dine-in restaurants commonly have a  1-2 hour wait before getting a table (Grimaldi's, Texas Roadhouse, Applebees, Olive Garden, Red Lobster, Cheesecake Factory, etc...etc...)  They also sell dry pastas, sauces and oils imported from Italy as well as offer a variety of fresh baked goods, I also like that I can pick up the latest copy of the free New Times newspaper there.  The pasta dishes are excellent. The only thing we've had they we were disappointed with is the pizza - which is kind of shocking, given how good everything else is and how authentically Italian it is otherwise.  Haven't tried anything from the deli. We go there primarily for the broasted fish and broasted chicken. You have to try both and decide which you like better (most people I take prefer the fish, but agree they are both great!).  Prices are very reasonable and lots of menu items to select from. And they serve Coke products. What more could I ask for?",

    "text": "I went to this gem of a place today for lunch with my aunt and niece,they had been there before but I had not.  I had a great sandwich called a prosciutto caprese, it had fresh mozzarella and basil on it and the bread was divine.  The whole sandwich with the tomatoes and oil combined with the fresh bread,prosciutto cut perfectly, homemade  (I'm guessing) mozzarella, served with broasted fries is on my top ten sandwiches I've ever had.  My aunt had an Italian sub that was delicious as well, but even she liked mine better. My niece got a little bowl of spaghetti which she loved almost as much as the chocolate cake we shared after.  It's a great environment,with real italian products for sale, deli items, baked goods, canolis that we took home are great too.  However, there was a bald man who may have been the manager or owner that was barking orders to his employees rather rudely it seemed. Also the air conditioning must have been broken because I was sweltering,  so was everyone else there.  It was hard to enjoy the experience when we were sweating the whole time. The waitress was great, I think her name was Jane, i know it began with a 'J' and she had long brown hair and big beautiful brown eyes, and a great smile. She was busy but still had time to be friendly,even when the guys were ringing a bell while she was talking (very disturbing ) she got all of our orders right, got the food out fast, and recommended the Caprese when I asked her about the best sandwiches they had.         So besides the air conditioning being out or not set low enough I would go back to this place, but I'd  rather order to go instead of sweating in there.  I'd like to try the chicken,it looked great.",

Delish!  When my parents came, they ordered the pastrami sub and the sausage subs. Commented in the amazing bread and meats. They want to go back!  Last thing- soups are to die for!  On service, both times we went early lunch. Our waitress was accommodating, sweet and fast. In seeing other reviews on service, I would recommend going early lunch or early dinner to beat the rush.

As soon as you walk thru the door you feel like you've been sent through some sort of time warp back to Old Time Chicago. From the Deli style counters to the booths for dining in this is a great date spot. The staff was helpful and friendly which made me feel very welcome and at home.  The only negative because well nothing is perfect is that no one welcomed us as we came in and it was mildly awkward figuring out where to place a take out order. Yet that still dims in comparison to my experience. Shout out to @Fox10 news you hit it out of the park with this recommendation!",

    "text": "How authentic of a Chicago place is Guido's?  Well, they have Old Style beer in the Frig!  Guido's is really a Chicago Italian deli, that doubles as sandwich and pasta place.  The food is good, but where they excel are with items from their deli case.  Take for instance the italian sausage.  It's home made and delicious.  Really!  You should come here just to order it for lunch, or to take a roll of it home for cooking.  As we were waiting for our dinner order to arrive, I decided to walk around the store.  The specialty salads looked amazing.  If I hadn't already ordered, the calamari salad really looked good.  I don't know how it tastes, but I made a mental note to come back for lunch and try it.  They also have a wide selection of non deli items, but the prices can be high.  The San Marzano brand of Marinara pasta sauces was marked $12.99 on a dusty jar.  The same sauce at Whole Foods is $8.75.  That 12 oz can of Old Style I mentioned above?  Well, it was $4.00.  I could go on, but you can see where I am going.  Competition can be a wonderful thing, Guido's reminds me very much of DeFalco's further down Scottsdale Road and south of Old Town. If you live north of here, then Guido's is a viable alternative. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/defalcos-italian-grocery-scottsdale#hrid:4ltqc2OvnsY8NUYW-NLU-w\">yelp.com/biz/defalcos-it...</a>   For dinner we ordered the Chicken Parmesan and bowl of Angel Hair with sausage and meatballs.  Both came with a house salad.  The marinara sauce was good, but somewhat bland, without the taste of any garlic or oregano. Along with two Ice Teas, our meal ran us $35.90 including taxes, but before gratuities.    Guido's is Three Stars, \"A-OK\".",

We ordered the linguine and clams and veal piccata which came with a side plate of spaghetti and red sauce. Both dishes came out looking like soup. Pasta was overcooked and drenched in liquid and grease. Veal came in the same manner, drenched in sauce although tastier than the pasta, but 1/4 inch of liquid is too much for any dish that is not soup.  I love your deli, subs, chicken, even pizza but i was extremely disappointed with the pasta which should be the staple of any Italian cooking. If this was my first experience at guidos i would never go back. I will still go to guidos but never for anything but the broasted chicken or sandwiches",

It reminded me of a pizza place back home that hasn't been updated since the 90s but doesn't matter since the food is on point. I got the italian sandwich, would've liked more meat but it was good. I will definitely become a regular here.   Oh, and if you complained about the service, did you really expect 5 star service at a deli? Get off your \"foodie\" high horse.",

I thought the chicken sandwich was good. My friend had the meatball sandwich which they really enjoyed.  I went back a second time with family and the service was seriously some of the worst I've ever dealt with in any dining experience. There were 4 of us - 2 of us were served the wrong meals, drinks were brought out very late (they forgot one drink), and the gnocchi were pretty bad (I thought it was funny how the chef came out and pulled a packet of gnocchi that was for sale off the shelf right in front of us right after we ordered). We were the only people in the restaurant at the time so we knew it was coming to us.  Besides getting the orders mixed up, the server would ask one person what they wanted, go to the next person, and then go back to the previous person to confirm what they ordered. He had a pad of paper in his hand so I'm not sure if he was writing down our order or doodling.",

Pricing was very reasonable and the menu selection huge. I look forward to trying some of the deli products to take home for dinner. Thank goodness for google maps that have led us to Guidos.",

We were a group of 4, and found a table immediately. The server (Maria) was reasonably fast given how busy the place was, and. although it took a while to arrive, the food was out of this world!  Finding an Italian restaurant that serves low carb food is almost impossible, but Guido's actually has more than one item on the menu that I could eat without substitutions ... and they were unbelievably tasty. To top it all off, since I'm a pretty handy cook myself, I'm forever wishing I had my spice rack with me when I eat out - this is the first time I haven't thought that in ages! Give it a try, and be willing to take your time. Food this good isn't instant!",

Looks can be deceiving because when i got inside this was basically a full-service restaurant, deli, and then some.   Food took a while to come out but it was a busy night and I could see that they really cook everything homestyle and to order. It was definitely worth the wait.  I ordered the chicken parmesan sandwich which was hot and delicious, the sauce and uality of the food gives me confidence to come back and sample the whole menu.",

They were minced canned clams. The pasta was cooked a proper al dente but under seasoned. A little garlic would have gone a long way to making it a better dish. One of our guests got the broasted chicken and it was super dry. The raviolis and meatballs were OK, but nothing special. Service was OK. No beers on tap. No cold glasses either. This place would be fine for lunch, but there are a lot better options for an authentic Italian dinner.",

Also a different bread every time so you never know which one you are getting--some breads I like better than others. I also tried the calzones, lasagna, diavalo, and the clam sauce. All delicious.  Service is usually good. Maria is one of the best waitress there and always a 5 star for service when she the waitress. Another woman with long brown hair is usually a 3 star when we get her.  I'll be back. Hope it goes back to 5 stars.",

The atmosphere. The service. My drink cup was never empty. Which usually is a nuisance. But not at this place. It was a blessing.
