I found the food to be creative and great tasting.  I had the chicken one night and it was finger licking good.  Chef Charleen has it going on, as well as the rest of the staff.  If your looking for a great night of food and wine try this place you won't be disappointed.  This place is quickly becoming a hot spot so call ahead for RSVP, the place only has 36 seats in it.

The chicken is phenomenal - perfect example of how a humble dish can excel with great execution.  Someone in your party has to order it.  The lamb was similarly terrific.  The braised leeks are well covered in other reviews here and are a great choice, but the fennel was even better - the ratio of various ingredients perfectly balanced and with just the right amount of dressing.  If you consider yourself a \"foodie\" - or whatever annoying term we use to describe ourselves - you owe yourself a trip to FnB.  This is a restaurant that could thrive in any market in the country - Phoenicians be thankful it is in your hood.",

    "text": "Full disclosure, I know Charleen and think she's great.  She didn't pay or help or prompt me in any way to write this.  I just think this place is one of the best for foodies in the valley.  First time at their new locale, and the food and service was as great as ever.  I actually said \"thats the best chicken I've ever put in my mouth\" and it was my husband's dinner, not mine.   Starters, pate and mozz/melted leeks were both outstanding.  I tell myself that i have to learn to make mozz like she does  but then I remember I have a day job which is not culinary inclined. I'll tell you that Char's burrrata is even better than the mozz if you can get it.  To order: the beet falafel is insanely good, not a thing I would choose to order normally but way worth your time! I happen to think its the Chef's favorite starter! The beet falafel has a beet puree, the best pita chips you'll ever taste, yogurt sauce and other yummy accouterments. I'm a foodie but it's hard for even me to explain why and how this is so effing perfect.  Just go there and try it.     When faced with starters like mussels and lamb riblets, I know it's a challenge. But please try the aforementioned pate which was had a wonderful richness offset by gherkins and grainy mustard. I love me some Matt Carter but I daresay this is better than Zinc's homemade pate, which is now second to Char's.    Pasta with cauliflower, green beans, some other things I forgot because there's always crispy  parm/reggiano frico on top which makes me lose my mind to the point that I can hardly remember to wipe the amazing butter sauce off my chin.  Should I say something bad to balance my review? I'm struggling.  We had a new to us waiter named Travis and he rocked.  Did I mention that they have WINE ON TAP? Travis explained it's just a pony keg like beer but with a nitrogen line aka Guinness so the wine doesn't oxidize.  So smart. So want one.    You should go to FnB. If you hate it call me.  I'll be sitting by the phone that doesn't ring.",

    "text": "Only in town for 3 days - So many restaurants, not enough time!  After much consideration, I chose FnB and did not regret it.  Located on a charming street in Old Town, this place was walking distance to several other restaurants and pubs.  The atmosphere was chic and bustling, while service was sincere and personal.  But mainly I picked this place for the unique counter seating that lets you watch the action in the kitchen.  I appreciated that Friday night reservation was ready on time despite a full house, and my party of 4 was given the corner of the counter as promised!  Thank you!!  FnB features local and seasonal produce, meats, and even wine!  We started off with some Arizona vino, which was surprisingly nice (even for the wine snobs in the group).  The food menu was extremely limited, even for a restaurant of this size.   There were only four entree selections... and NO FISH OPTION!   This is how I felt about that:  /:(  Here's what we ate:  * Braised leeks w/ mozzerella - This dish was praised in Food & Wine so perhaps my expectations were too high.  It tasted like leeks, cheese, and a fried egg.  There were no special flavors in this dish, and after sitting for 2 minutes the cheese got hard and rubbery.  * Rainbow Valley Butter - Butter as an appetizer?  What the hell, we're on vacation!   The generous mound of freshly churned butter was awesome on top of crusty bread with local honey and cashews.  The radishes seemed an odd accompaniment but I was told radishes and butter are a classic French pairing.  * Crispy Jidori Chicken - It's a good, basic roast chicken.    * Pasta du Jour - The pasta was a unique kind of shape, but other than that there was nothing special here.  There was a little bit of chewy pancetta and a ton of cauliflower florets in the pasta.  The sauce was broth-based with a hint of lemon.  Not great.  * Seared Scallops - Lame dish.  The scallops were served on top of plain steamed jasmine rice/quinoa (but primarily rice), with a lemony relish.    Overall take?  Pleasantly surprised by atmosphere and service, underwhelmed by food.  Entrees are probably overpriced for what they are, but we still left full and happy.  Would possibly come back after checking out other restaurants in the area!",

    "text": "My meal at FnB last weekend was one of the best I've had in Arizona. I love everything about this place, the food, the cocktails, the staff, the atmosphere.  It was a rainy Sunday. I knew the restaurant was right next to Cowboy Ciao, but managed to walk right by it (my friends noticed me go by). I turned back, and Pavle was nice enough to wait at the door, and said \"Ben?\" as I was about to pass by again. I agree with what everyone else said here, Pavle really makes you feel at home.  I started with the slivered fennel salad and a ginhound. I split the order with a friend, and they were more than happy to bring the salad split  onto two plates for us. I love citrus, and these were a very refreshing start to my meal.   Next up was the trout. It was presented stacked on top of the sunchokes and caramelized onions, with some wonderful broth on the plate. The combination of flavors was rich, and amazing, and the presentation ensured that every bite was as good as the last. I could eat this every visit, but I sampled the chicken and lamb, and was just as blown away. For desert I had lemon cake with ice cream and strawberry compote.   FnB has been receiving a lot of positive buzz lately. It's well deserved. If you haven't visited yet, you're missing out.",

A creative menu that changes constantly there is never a dull item to choose from and their support of local farmers and Arizona wineries is a bonus.  Try anything on the menu it's all delicious.  Their leek appetizer(seasonal) was rated one of the top appetizers in the country.  Their selection of Arizona wines will change your mind about the potential for good vino in the desert.  They schedule winemaker dinners once a month on Tuesday evenings and the courses pair very well with the wine.  My wife and I have been to two and loved every minute of it.  Also,  Saturday nights at 10 pm there is a special menu with huge discounts on a particular entree.  If you have not been don't wait any longer.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fnbrestaurant.com%2F&s=7393cd4fe05264bbc6793be4d67a4c64babd045307e60ba68856e14a896a8bb5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">fnbrestaurant.com</a>  Thanks Charlene and Pavel  Matt C",

    "text": "Unlike other reviewers, I'm not on a first-name basis with the owners/employees.  We started with the spiced nuts (great) and the rock shrimp (average).  The shrimp seemed like a well prepared version of a TGIF appetizer.  Not particularly thoughtful or memorable.  Next we had the asparagus (great) and the mozzarella (odd).  The asparagus was a great marriage of its ingredients, whereas the mozzarella left me thinking that the whole was much less than the parts.  The leeks, mozzarella, bread crumbs and fried egg didn't really complement each other.  The ingredients were each good, but the combination was, well, boring.  For entrees we had the bass and the chicken.  The sauce for the bass was great, but the fish itself wasn't noteworthy.  The chicken was tender, but I had to cut back on the skin as the rub was extremely salty.  The veggies (leeks and fava beans) that came with the chicken were great.  For dessert we had the chocolate mint creme brulee and butterscotch pudding.  The creme brulee was a mistake, as all subtlety was lost in the dish.   I wish they'd been serving a traditional creme brulee that night.  The butterscotch pudding was the highlight of the night.  The flavor was deep and complex and not overly sweet.  It was the best pudding I have ever had.  The service was solid.  We arrived for our reservation on time, and were immediately seated.  I liked how different members of the wait staff checked on us throughout the night, not just our assigned waitress.  The food was good but not great.  I appreciate that they use sustainable ingredients.  However, when you make a menu that small (the items I mentioned above represent nearly half the menu), there is little room for error.  When I factor in the steep price, I don't expect to be dining at FnB again, even for a special occasion.",

    "text": "I have to go w/ five.  I can still remember every, even the most subtle flavor, starting with the bread and oil, the Ginhound cocktail, followed by the salad (we chose the salad Pavle talked up, and we were not disappointed).  As we munched on the salad, I commented to my dining partner that we were eating a lot of grapefruit - both the Ginhound and the shaved fennel salad featured the fruit, but neither were overly bitter at all.  It was the ideal way to start the meal.  We elected to carry on with the Spigarello (delicious- excellent balance of garlic and a slightly buttery taste) again per Pavle's recommendation, along with an order of the mozzarella w/ an egg over braised leeks.  This was my favorite dish (well, tied with the salad and dessert...).  The mustard breadcrumbs added a little tangy flavor along with a fantastic texture.    Finally, we decided to split the bread pudding dessert.  Made w/ chocolate/cherry bread from the Phoenician's bakery (available at the Old Town Farmer's Market in Scottsdale), it was decadent.    All in all a fantastic meal - everything was perfect.  The atmosphere, the service...  It was fantastic.  You won't regret going there.",

Before going I had our meal all planned out in order to try the things people have most commonly recommended on yelp.  So, we had the valley butter, etc., which was so good, we especially loved the honeycomb.  We also had the braised leeks, which were tasty.  The jidori chicken with spatzel was my favorite.  It was so juicy and crispy and the spatzel with greens was amazing.  We also had the ginger cake, which was good, but not great.  I really liked sitting at the bar watching the chef cook our meal and other meals, especially because I loved to cook.  I enjoyed the fact that they had only AZ wines/beers; the wine was great and my husband enjoyed his AZ beer.   It was a great dinner and we will most certainly be back in the future!!!",

While driving around I called to inquire as to the wait time for a table (knowing the place was not big), I was told they would have a table in about 15 minutes, when we arrived 10 minutes later we were seated immediately.    Everything on the menu looked so good it was hard to make a decision, ultimately I chose the lamb and my dining companion chose the chicken.  The lamb was incredible and cooked perfectly; on a bed of fingerling potatoes, snap peas and olives, with just the right amount of mint; there was a little too much oil on the vegetables, this may have just been due to the olives.   I was able to sample the chicken and found it to be perfect, not dry and perfectly seasoned.  If only chicken could always taste that good.  Hopefully the chicken will still be on the menu when I go back!",

I love the decor and the new floor is exquisite and I think they've made it look a much lovelier dining experience all around, especially considering the space constraints.   We waited a few moments at the door while Pavle and Co found us seats at the bar. Though we were there for sweets, Dottsy couldn't resist getting an order of the rock shrimp with jalapeno tartar sauce and god bless her. It was delightful! MMMM, now I want more of it...anyway, we went ahead and ordered 1 of each of the desserts on the menu (only 3 last night we're not animals). I ordered the apple ginger thingie (can't think of the name, sorry), Dottsy had the chocolate cherry bread pudding and Chrissy had the lemon creme brulee. The creme brulee blew me away, it was so delicate and lightly infused with lemon essence it was like a pillow of sugar deliciousness. The chocolate-cherry dessert was a mouth full of yum as well, and my apple ginger dessert was tasty, thought I like a bit more ginger zing in general. Ohh they are so good.   The rest of the dinner menu looks fantastic as well. I will be back to test the rest of it out soon!",

The jidori chicken with spaetzle dumplings and broccilini was heavenly.  The rock shrimp came out fried like popcorn shrimp.  But it was so much better than what you'd expect from popcorn shrimp.  The batter was light, almost non-existent, shrimp was tender and juicy and it was pared with a dipping sauce you'd want to dip everything with.  The Tuscan kale falafel didn't disappoint and was a good starter.  The trout and fennel salad was a good combo of flavors that I didn't expect to be good, but was.  Overall, a great place to try different small dishes and share.  The entree selection was limited to four items so I'd say it's not a place for large parties.

    "text": "Tonight was my third time dining at FnB since the opening, and I don't plan on slowing the frequency of my visits. Each experience has been unique with a consistently high level of quality.  In a tiny spot that has housed previous excellence, the owners have managed to create a radically new atmosphere in Old Town Scottsdale. The decor, revolving around the gorgeous tiled floor, is highlighted by homey and personal touches. The room itself seems to generate warmth which is perpetuated by the owners and staff. The open kitchen spotlights the care and attentiveness that is given to every dish that's prepared, and if you take a seat at the bar set around the kitchen you can watch and interact with Chef Charleen and Sous Chef Sasha.  I'm impressed with the Arizona centered wine list.  It is fantastic to see local industries support one another.  Callaghan's Buena Suerte cuvee is always one of my super favorites.  Tonight my guests and I shared the Benton Farms country ham and goat cheddar with house pickled local veggies, fried green tomatoes with green goddess dressing and feta (that kept their firmness and acidity), the crispy rock shrimp with jalapeno tartar and my favorite, the shaved fennel with local citrus salad. The breading on the rock shrimp was light and not overdone at all, you could really get the texture of the shrimp, and the tartar had just the right amount of heat.  With patient and attentive guidance from our server Emily, I ordered the flat iron steak with a golden raisin salsa verde and cauliflower for my entree. Rather than something to take up space on the plate, the cauliflower was tasty and a star in and of itself. The steak was perfectly prepared and matched up well with the raisin salsa verde. For $21 it was a great value.  Another standout at the table was boneless trout with sunchokes, caramelized onions and dill. It was so delicate that the fish fell right off the skin. Chef Charleen Badman manages to couple delicate preparations with comfort and tangible flavors.  To finish we shared the butterscotch pudding. There was fighting over the last bite. Delish.  Our check was presented with a bite-size peanut brittle for each guest, a yummy way to end our night.",

Asparagus was stringy Squash was dead on the plate  Ribeye was grisly and fatty, the meat fought me more during meal than at the animals actual death. Sauces were of no consequence and the chimi churi was ....... Well a culinary joke, please chef look up how to make this, no excuse you've got culinary school and the Internet for help. The staff will encourage you to order appetizers because they quote \" don't want you to wait too long to eat\" I heard this 4 times as the waiter made his way around customers. Serving staff were good. To finalize this review, of all things the China plates were small, I ended up chasing my food between the plate and the paper table cover.

I went here because I saw \"fried green tomatoes\" , but they no longer offer those. That being said, what she suggested was amazing! I had some type of small plate dish that was a bread (can't remember the fancy name:), with greens, beets and jicama on top, amazing!! Hard to eat, but worth the mess. Also had the grilled asparagus in a cauliflower cream sauce w/ beer chips. The chips tasted just like the Trader Joe's version, but the asparagus and cream sauce were delicious. Main entree was the collard green dish she suggested and I'm so happy I took her suggestion. It was spicy and super filling!! Will definitely return here my next visit to Scottsdale. Extremely vegetarian friendly! The majority of the menu was vegetarian. Great find:)",

And the spaghetti squash was so flavorful. And the wine pics were perfect. Also, Mcallister the bartender was hilarious. All the staff worked well as a team.

Unlike Phoenix, mediocre restaurants can easily thrive in Scottsdale. Pick the right location and its high income citizens will drop cash at your joint for years. As a result, it's hard to find memorable dining spots that blow you away. FnB does.   The emphasis on local ingredients and even local wines and beers is fantastic. The service is top notch, in a casual and friendly way that's representative of our Arizona culture. The entire menu is unique and enticing. I didn't know what some of the ingredients were, so I asked, and received excellent, quick descriptions. The ambiance, again typical of our state, is relaxed but elegant in its own way. Charming is a good word for it.   For eating, we selected two appetizers and entrees each. The chef has not only gone out of his or her way to be as creative and unique as possible, but each one was prepared meticulously. Every bite was delicious.",

Every starter, side, veggie dish, and entree I've had has been painstakingly prepared to perfection and manages to taste both rich and light at the same time.

If you take someone here, s/he'll be impressed.  Reservations are a must, as the place is small (and a bit closed-in feeling), and items are not inexpensive.

Cranberry Presbyterian - cranberry vodka, ginger ale, lemon  Iced Tea  Bread and Olive Oil  Duck Egg and Black Olive Relish  Swiss chard falafel, egg, sina's sauce, marinated greens, hazelnuts  Braised leeks, mozzarella, mustard bread crumbs, fried egg  Vacherin Cheese, Dates, Pecans, Apples, Honeycomb, Grilled Nut Bread, Kumquat Moustarda  Lamb Riblets, Sherry Vinegar, Honey, Aleppo, couscous  Brussels Sprouts, Balsamic, Honey, Grapes  Sunchokes, Farro, Chantarelles, Feta  Scallops, cara cara orange salsa verde, sunchokes  Chocolate Cake  Huckleberry creme brulee  Persimmon cake with ginger ice cream  After a pre-meal snack at the now-shuttered Lee's Cream Liqueur, a nice enough place whose ice cream was decent but poorly marketed in a high rent area (I contest that she could make a killing setting up shop in Portland or Brooklyn) my mother, aunt, and I made our way to local darling - and soon to be relocated - FnB.  Knowing Charleen Badman's skills with meats, and more so local produce, I figured that giving the restaurant a second look with family in tow would not only be more fun, but also allow me to sample more of the ever-evolving menu and on both counts I was correct, though unlike my first visit not everything wowed.  Perhaps a fault of the season, or perhaps secondary to the pending move and a jammed-packed house my second trip to FnB (and third meal cooked by Badman, including the Fried Chicken Face-off at noca,) everything at the restaurant just seemed slightly 'off' that night - servers abrupt, pacing off, and the price/quality/quantity ratio all skewed to the left while the sunchoke dish was nearly flavorless and the falafel too dense, served luke-warm, and the majority returned to the kitchen without comment (from our table or the servers.)  Additionally underwhelming considering the $14 price tag was the petite portion of a relatively common cheese - though the accoutrements were all exemplary.  Moving on to what worked - that can be more or less summed up by the rest of the plates; from the creamy hard boiled duck eggs topped with briny olives to the famous leeks and riblets, on to the best Brussels sprouts I've ever encountered and some truly inspired desserts - the persimmon cake particularly with a carrot-cake texture that fused brilliantly with the intense ice cream from Sweet Republic.  More relaxed than my first visit, but at the same time also with less \"wow\" moments I still contest that although there are plenty of things that FnB does very well it is no more than a \"local\" restaurant and a far cry from what many have designated it as \"The Best in Arizona.\"",

It was my birthday dinner with just family so it was the perfect intimate place to have my dinner.  Summer - they are not open Sunday- Tuesday and being Labor Day weekend glad we called ahead because starting in Sept. they are now open on Tuesdays.    The food!  I love how the menu constantly changes depending what is in season.  My 11 yr. son was a little disappointed when they did not have a kids menu.  Rest assure our waitress was on it and gave him some suggestions and he was absolutely happy with his order.  When his order came out he thought this is a small portion.  He was pleasantly surprise the bowls are deceiving and it was more food than he anticipated.  His pasta, butter and parmesan was 13.00 bucks.  I am glad he enjoyed it....little steep.  The rest of us had the roasted squash- delicious, pasta lobster mushroom dish which was to die for.  The flavors in that dish was unbelievable.  It was even better the next day for lunch...had leftovers.  Last dish was the pork & beef meatballs and my husband loved them.  The portions looks small when they come out but they are really filling and just the right amount.    I love how they feature Arizona wines (which I am skeptical at times) and beer...no skepticism there.  FnB served some great AZ brews.   The staff here is great.  Our hostess and waitress were absolutely  informative and very friendly gave us taste of a wine to see if we would like it.  The service all around was great.  At the end, which was really unexpected but they did bring out a birthday dessert of my choice-included a cute little candle and my family singing me happy birthday.....Priceless!",

When I called to make a reservation on a Saturday night earlier in the day, they couldn't get us in until 9 pm.  I guess I shouldn't have been too surprised given it was the weekend.  I asked if they could call me back if there was a cancellation for an earlier time and the person on the phone, I believe his name was Pavle, obliged without hesitation.  10 minutes later I get a call back about a cancellation near the time I initially requested.  I thought that was nice he called back.  The menu isn't huge and a lot of what was on there I had never heard of.  Pavle was so helpful though as he explained in detail the food and how the ingredients meld together to bring out the flavor.  The socca was amazing.  It was very flavorful, as were the fried green tomatoes.  My friend is vegetarian and although there were vegetarian items on the menu, Pavle recommended that the chef make a special vegetarian dish for her that wasn't on the menu.  I thought that was a cool gesture.    The restaurant is small but the ambiance is trendy.  We left impressed with the food and happy with our decision to come to this restaurant.",

    "text": "So my coworker and I were on business travel and showed up here with no reservations at about 5:45 on a weekday night.  No space at the bar was available but the hostess was willing to give us a table but not before looking us in the eye and saying \"I have a table that's open now but is reserved at 7. Will you guys be able to finish by then?\" After a quick yes ma'am we were shown to the table and the flavor stampede began.    Apps: We shared the radish/butter/honey/cashew plate and the cheese/fruit/bread plate.  Let me preface this with I don't like radishes, but I'd hurdle over my mother to get another plate of the radishes and honey.  The cheese plate was tasty and had a good variety but I was on the edge of picking up the radish plate and just licking it clean.  Ridiculously delicious.  Mains: I opted for the ribeye with the chimichurri and he got the jidori chicken since he had steak the previous day.  Easily one of the best steaks I've ever had.  It was juicy and cooked a perfect medium rare.  The chimichurri had great flavor without overpowering the juices that flowed out of the steak.  If I was willing to hurdle my mom to get the radishes, I'd cross check my dad to get this steak.  The jidori chicken looked really good and my coworker enjoyed it but it was obvious he had some steak envy going on.  We opted out of dessert since there was an 'adult' (read: alcoholic) ice cream shop down the way we wanted to try and we left full and happy because of the fantastic food we just had.

The rutabaga gilfeather with ginger creme fraiche was an unbelievable compliment to the meal - the best rutabaga we've ever had. Heard enough? The chicken and chocolate dessert were off the charts, and the service was outstanding. A little tricky to find, but well worth it. Wow.",

    "text": "my girlfriend & i loved our dinner at FnB. duck breast entree with chorizo, a slightly crunchy textured saffron rice & black olive tapenade was beautifully prepared --an almost perfectly balanced dish. while not as spectac the pasta with lobster mushrooms & peas definitely qualified as delicious home-style comfort food. green salad with fennel / cucumber / feta & grilled shishito pepper appetizers were both gold star, smashed cucumbers tasted a little under-dressed to us. all three appetizers were wonderfully fresh. grilled okra with labna yogurt & hazelnuts was right up there among the best vegetable dishes i've had in years. we seldom get desert, at FnB we ordered two, & both the labna ice cream & buttered corn bread with plums & vanilla ice cream killed it. we were initially taken aback that the only by-the-glass wines are from arizona vintners but the two reds recommended by the waiter worked out well. bottle list is eclectic in the best way, heavy on gamay & pino, two cabs only both from lebanon... service was informed, enthusiastic & articulate.   we ate here at the end of a two week road trip that included great restaurants in sonoma, san francisco, big sur & santa barbara. FnB was as good as anything we had along the way. it would shine anywhere, in scottsdale it is manna from heaven.",

We just ask the waiter to bring us whatever he recommends. And we are never dissatisfied. Cool thing is menu always changes with the seasons  This is our go-to restaurant for outta town guests.

    "text": "I went to FnB a few months back with the boyfriend after yelping places to visit while in town and finding this place had the most 5 star reviews.  While we were in town they had Dave's Roast Chicken and some kind of steak, a pasta dish and a fish dish. That steak is the best steak I have ever had in my life. I was a little sad when it was all gone...I just wanted to keep it in my mouth and not swallow it. Maybe even go to sleep with it in my mouth. It was so great that I called the next day to eat there again (they were booked for 5 days in advance!! boo) or to take it to go (they laughed at me when I said I was desperate to have that again before heading back to OC).  I don't remember what the Chicken tasted like but I remembered liking it a lot as well. The fish had a nice spicy sauce on top and it was also great. We did not try the pasta, didn't think it would be appropriate to fill up on carbs when there was all this yummy food to eat. They have seasonal menus which is great and the ambiance is great for dates, and to go eat with friends before a night out. They have cute drinks and tons of wine to pick from. Check out their Wine store as well!  It is not a huge restaurant and it is the best so make reservations before going.",

Once we got our food wait staff disappeared and focused on larger tables. Never got refills on water or any acknowledgment.

Had the braised leeks to start, which appeared to have been made less of leeks and more of a white cheese that I can only assume had been allowed to congeal into a rubbery mat beneath a heat lamp.  It was literally impossible to cut into bite-sized pieces, and was tasteless besides.    Then, after at least a half an hour wait, pasta with chanterelles.  The shrooms were great, and I have to say I enjoyed fennel for the first time in my life, but the pasta was enormous in size and there was an awful lot of it.  But one of my friends had the fried green tomatoes, which were wonderful, and another had the brussell sprouts, also wonderful, and the butterscotch pudding dessert with the nutmeg whipped cream was simply divine.  They were very busy (our reserved table was 20 minutes late and the seats were still warm when we sat down), so I'm thinking they were just run off their feet.  I'd give them another chance.  Oh, and a delightful Arizona sauvignon blanc.  I'm told they serve only Arizona wines, which is kinda cool..",

If you have not been yet, this place is worth a meal alone, with friends or a special date night.  The location is walkable from the Fashion Square Mall or the W.  Highlights: The FnB always comes up with unique approaches on simple food with great flavors.  Their meats are especially exceptional and always cooked to a \"T\" (my mouth is watering just thinking about my last meal here).  A great example of a unique dish was grilled broccoli with a spicy dressing and pine nuts.  The piece of broccoli was the size of a saucer!!  talk about using local produce.  Anyway, if you are looking to change up your dinner routine, want to have some great food that is a little outside the box and have the owners share the passions with you through their food, give FnB a shot.",

I will be honest, I can't recall every single delicious item I gleefully devoured but what I can tell you is that there was not one single item that was not delicious and ever so eloquently presented.

On my most recent visit, we started with the okra, socca, and beefsteak tomato appetizers. The okra (served with lime labne and hazelnuts) was amazing. I had the roasted squash with chikpea puree and pine nuts for my entree, and loved it. It was a great combination of fresh, vibrant flavors!  The wine list is exceptional, with a wide variety of wines from Arizona and other regions as well. The somm was super knowledgeable and helpful, too.   Service was also good. I was happy to see that FnB has added additional tables and a bar in the extra room to accommodate more guests, as it is always difficult to get a table here.  Only downside is that the main dining room can be kind of loud, especially when the room is packed with dinner guests. It may be difficult to have a nice meal here with more than just a few others.",

As I checked into the restaurant. Was greeted and sat immediately. So, far wow great looks like the evening dinner might go well. I was not impressed by either table that was offered. I HATE I HATE I HATE sitting near foot traffic. The corner table was next to the wine storage and we sat right under the magazine rack. HOW IS THIS assigned as a dinner/seating table? BIZARRE.  The lamp above the wine storage was making me melt and stick to the chair. Let me just enjoy dinner sitting in the corner in this warm warm hole.   I did enjoy the meals and the complimentary sparkling beverage. The food presentation was sloppy and the use of beans as garnish/filler in every dish was repetitive.   Our waiter was not engaging at all. Only when he set down the bill. The food runner and busboy did their best to provide service even though I don't think it is their job. Not their fault.   I am scratching my head here... wondering how in the world did they even make it on the James Beard nominees list?   Would I come back? Would I come back if the manager e-mails me? No & No. It is what it is. I can't change the fact I had terrible service. But they can.   I had no idea they had a bar next door and it looked more appealing to have dinner there. There was no customers on that side, but the bartender.",

    "text": "FnB is a charming little eatery in the downtown Scottsdale area. The menu offers some unique combinations of food and beautifully presented dishes. We ate here for lunch and had the grilled trout rillettes. They were served on a wooden board with a lovely selection of grilled ciabatta(?) bread, regular and sweet potato chips, arugula, fresh tarragon, pickled egg, pickled beets and a creamy horseradish sauce. The rillettes were well sealed by the layer of (duck?) fat on top of the small glass jar and a treasure trove of trout with cream and herbs lay underneath. The taste was delicate and spread very nicely on the bread. While I loved the horseradish sauce it overpowered the mild taste of the rillette so I had to put the barest amount of it on the bread. As for the other elements on the wooden board, I enjoyed the peppery arugula, fresh aromatic tarragon and vinegary sweet pickled beets. The pickled egg was a beautiful cheery magenta red color. I couldn't taste a lot of pickled flavor in it though and the egg had a slight greyish tinge around the yolk. Unfortunately some of the potato chips were stale and chewy while others were light and crisp. After running out of grilled bread I actually spread the rest of the rillettes on a potato chip to discover I preferred this combination over the bread due to the contrast of crispiness and light saltiness with the creamy rillette.  Service was on point. Drinks were refilled as needed and everyone here was very friendly.  I'll definitely come back again for more one-of-a-kind selections from FnB!",

    "text": "Brilliant! Unequivocally a 5-star experience. From ambiance, service, presentation to flavor, FnB does not disappoint. Thanks to fellow Yelper, Karen W., I got to enjoy this gem.   Tip: Make reservations ahead of time with Open Table.   Our reservation was at 1:15 pm but I got there a little early. The lunch menu was small, but each item on the boutique menu looked amazing. I peeked over other tables and was impressed by the portion size of the fresh egg salad sandwich with beets and greens. Wow!  My server was attentive and hospitable. Even though I waited a while without ordering, he made me feel welcome by his smiles and presence.  After perusing the menu and what other customers were being served, I decided to order the trout rillettes. I am a rillettes fan so it was a no-brainer. Karen also chose the same thing. We were impressed when our gorgeous lunch boards arrived. The adorably potted trout rillettes came in a glass mason jar. The trout had the most divine texture and flavor, it was both creamy and flaky and delicately seasoned with trace amount of herbs, covered with I believe duck fat. This was accompanied by toasted rustic bread with a nice char and chew, potato and sweet potato chips, pickled beets, pickled egg and arugula and a horseradish dipping crema. Everything tasted fresh and delicious. The star of the show was the colorful heirloom beets pickled carefully. I could've enjoyed a whole meal of beets. I enjoyed pairing the rillettes with the salty potato chips. I enjoyed eating the beats with the bread and pickled hard boiled egg. Finally, I ate the arugula with the horseradish crema. I thought the crema obscured the gingerly seasoned trout rillettes.   Chef is genius! She has inspired me to create a warm weather menu for my family's table through her simple but creative menu. The protein chef highlighted included eggs, cheeses and fish. Her plates are designed to give equal significance to carbohydrates and vegetables. I love the notion of choosing beautiful vegetables offered using multiple culinary techniques, raw and prepared. She also didn't offer an over abundance of carbohydrates, but did present variety. Her plates were a feast for both the eyes and the taste buds. I cannot wait to cook my summer meals now. I also look forward to treating myself to another meal at FnB!  Tip: Parking can be a nightmare especially on the street. There is a free parking garage just next to the cluster of shops FnB is tucked in. FnB is located in a quaint courtyard. Their outdoor dining patio frames their entrance. They have a small sideboard that they use for their maitre-'d station.",

We got the persimmon salad, the pickled shrimp with saltines, and the lamb riblets. Everything was great and the dishes really highlighted the quality of the individual ingredients well. I'm not sure that the pickled shrimp and saltines worked well together. Service was fast and friendly.",

PROS The food was incredible, we were all so happy to share, highlighted: -bok choy with ginger dumplings -crispy chickpeas had a great texture and spice  -squash and cauliflower had a great sauce with lots of herbs and green onion -my hubby loved his rib eye and annihilated it, huge portion -my duck confit pasta was very tasty and rich, lots fo green herbs and the sauce was just the right amount. I hate it when it's drowning or is too dry so this was a good balance to pasta/sauce ratio. I ate about a 1/3 of it so looking forward to having this for lunch :)  CONS -Service was spotty - we requested a few different bread plates since they were dirty then were completely forgotten. Little misses here and there when requesting  -A little slow for drink / cocktail refills",

    "text": "After having Sheepdogs and Moscow Mules with bites of nachos and chips with guacamole and salsa at the CMYE: Meet Your CM event, I was ready for some good eats!  Yuko H. had plans with Aileen B. for some dinner here at this adorable place and with a hungry appetite and booze to burn off, I tagged along.  What a night!  It was our own UYE/PYE inside the Charleen Room.  Out of our intimate party of five, Aileen was the only one that had been here before and she told us all about the co-owners and their previous location.  It made for pleasant talk while we nibbled on warm bread with EVOO.  McCallister was our server for the night and he was great.  He was charming, knowledgeable, and I think he had a thing for Aileen AND Yuko!  ;)  With a rotating menu, it's not very helpful to talk about my dish for the evening but hey, it's my review so why not?  I had ordered the Yellow tail for $30.  It had featured a beautifully seared and nicely seasoned yellow tail served on top of a generous bed of cous cous with avocados and hearts of palm and tomatillo sauce.  It was a beautiful medley of flavors and texture and with the help of some friends, I polished off my plate.  I also got to sneak some bites of the Summer Squash, Pork Tenderloin [chick peas, radishes, kidney beans, and other yummies in one bite... goodness!] and Socca with cultured butter.  The food was amazing and fresh and I like the farm-to-table theme this place has going on.    All in all, I had a wonderful dinner with some of the best Yelpers in Phoenix!  Thanks for the great night!",

The chicken (a thigh and half a breast) was boring and the accompanying pasta was also greasy. For digestif I had the chartreuse cocktail, which was very pleasant but not worth $16 because in the end you're still just sluming it in greater PHX, and you need that drink just to recover from the underwhelming meal (I do recommend the drink--medicinal and complex floral nigh vegetal). Service was good but nothing beyond what you'd expect at $50/head; the ambient noise is bright and loud. Seen it before, move on.

I'm a foodie slash \"wino\" so I rally enjoyed getting to talk about what we were eating/drinking.   We tried a few local wines, including \"Hannah's Blend\" red (named for Pavle's daughter Hannah, who also moonlights as the assistant Maitre D!). The wine was so delicious we got a bottle to take home!  In retrospect I wish we had bought a case!    Thanks to Pavle, and the whole staff at FnB for giving us a delightful last night of a long trip cross country.   Ps: TRY the spring rolls, the falafel and the CHICKEN!!! And of course -- get out of your comfort zone and try some of that tasty AZ wine!",

    "text": "What a TREAT!!       If you are looking for something with a nice quiet atmosphere that is a little off the beaten track I highly recommend FnB.       We navigated our way through the gaudy tourist trap shops of one of Scotsdale's main streets to find FnB, which is tucked away amongst some smaller local shops.      Our server (never got his name) was absolutely amazing.  He toured us through the menu steering us toward several amazing seasonal small plates, entrees, wine, and of course dessert.  Everything we had was simply amazing.  My favorite was the roasted winter squash served with chicken liver.  I will definitely be back.  Probably best to make a reservation as the restaurant is small - ish.",

The chef specializes in veggie dishes-- so flavorful and well-textured. The menu changes regularly, but if you can, try the kale falafel and the glazed carrots. We ordered about 4 small-medium dishes and shared!the only reason that this isn't 5 stars is I felt that the server was a bit pretentious. He asked that we order our meal all in one foul swoop, but we weren't in a rush, and we wanted to gauge how much we ordered by our hunger levels. But overall, definitely a repeat!",

The space has a pleasant feel and the staff is very friendly and accommodating. Would probably be an above average neighborhood place in Portland or San Francisco, but I guess this is one of the best places in the \"Valley of the Sun\"... as one bar proprietor told me new ideas take a while to reach Arizona.  I tasted nearly everything off the 2011 Spring menu and everything was pitch perfect or very near. I wish there was more seafood on the menu but I suppose doing a local food restaurant in Arizona doesn't permit it. The one thing I tried that wasn't quite as good as the rest was rock shrimp with chipoltle aioli. Don't get me wrong, it was good, but didn't quite fit in with the rest of the menu and the uttely ubiquitous battered shrimp have to be a bit better or have some twist to break through to 'fine dining' status.   The steak was wonderful but I wish it had been smaller. It was just too much meat. I do like that they didn't ask me how to cook it, and it came out rare. There is no such thing as cooking meat \"well\"- it's either rare or wrong.   The fried green tomatoes were outstanding! The flesh was tender and rich with a subtle sweetness. Not too sour and no bitterness. The cornmeal crust was crispy, rich and light. The was a distinct cinnamon note, pleasantly bringing up memories of apple pie without really tasting like it.  If I'm back in the area I'd return here, especially to see what's on the next seasonal menu!",

It's quaintly situated off a nice pedestrian street and we were immediately greeted by the hostess. We got a table near the window and she suggested several of the plates while we looked at the menu. We started off by ordering the socca and the french fried squash bottoms. I am not kidding when I say that the socca was THE most flavorful vegetable based dish I have ever eaten in my life...and I have eaten across the world and in several Michelin starred restaurants. The dish was absolutely amazing, the elephant garlic was fantastic, and the peppers had the most amazing flavor! Wow, what a fantastic dish...and especially in the middle of the summer it really served as a \"refreshing dish\" for us. The french fried squash bottoms were great as well, it seemed to be a popular dish throughout the restaurant. We ended up ordering a couple more dishes which may not be on the menu anymore (since they change the menu regularly). I assure you, you can't possibly go wrong in your choices at this place. The chef does an outstanding job at elevating fresh vegetables, and the service staff does a great job at describing the dishes. What a wonderful place to go!",

The restaurant was small but cozy and warm with floor to ceiling windows and a kitchen open to the diners.   The menu is small - only six items including dessert. You'll have to be game for almost anything to enjoy.  There were two of us, and we ordered the whole menu except dessert.   We started with a ramp dip with scallions and bacon served with a side of chips. It was fantastic!! The store next door sells the dip. I'm pretty sure I could eat it every day for a month. We asked for more chips so that we could eat every last drop. Next up was a bright and light salad with strawberries, pomegranate and vinaigrette. There were Asian inspired meatballs next and a celery root gratin. Both amazing. Finally we had a chicken swarma wrap. Good but the one thing we probably could have skipped.   We didn't drink anything but water, but it's worth noting that the wine list looked great and highly curated as well.   Best of all, the price for this ridiculous amount of food was totally reasonable. The restaurant was so great, we might go back for dinner too!",

Thanks dude, it was a first date and I was sweating enough as it was!    I had the \"piece of cheese\" tray for an app, it was a Bleau (usually not my fav) but it turned out to be quite good, mild and tasty.

    "text": "Let me start with the food.  The meal started off fine with a salad of beets, greens and goats cheese.  The deviled eggs from a variety of fowl was more like hard boiled eggs then deviled eggs.  Lamb chops had a nice flavor but came out before they had the chance to settle.  Fish over couscous was a disaster.  Conceptually the dish was suppose to be freshly cooked hot fish over cold couscous - this was verified by the server.  I don't see how this is a good idea because when you combine a hot element with a cold element you just get lukewarm, especially when one is piled on top of the other.  The fish was actually lukewarm because of a mistake in the kitchen.    Despite having a reservation the flustered server at the door asked us to check out the restaurant's attached shop.  It was quite a while before the server greeted our table.  Everything was fine until we waited over 35 minutes between the starters and entrees.  It is painfully obvious that the fish dish was cooked before the kitchen realized they forgot to fire the lamb chops.  Instead of re-cooking the fish the kitchen decided to send it out cold along with the sizzling chops.    Upon sending the dish back the server asked if we'd like anything else.  After explaining to her that I did not wish to prolong an unsatisfactory experience she sent over what appeared to be another server.  The gentlemen asked if there was anything else we would like and I just asked for the bill.  He barked at me 'there is no bill tonight' and quickly walked away without saying anything else or allowing me the opportunity to say anything else.  An awkward night ended with a quick good bye and lots of laughs in the car.",

The friendly crew is on top of everything without being overly intrusive, they're kind and they have plenty of knowledge regarding their menu and wine list. They go above and beyond to create a great atmosphere.  My problem last night was the food. Holy cow was it bad! Each vegetable dish came out swimming in piles of oil. At one point I looked to my wife and said something to the effect of, \"Wow... there's so much oil on this plate, my fork is literally sliding out of my hand.\" We shared six vegetarian dishes, each more oily than the dish prior. The meal got progressively worse. Sunchokes drowned in oil, leaks drowned in oil, you get the picture.  We've been to FnB before and usually enjoy the food. This trip was a disaster though and I don't think we'll be heading back. In the words of Tom Colicchio on Top Chef, \"Did you even try the food before sending it out of the kitchen?\" would be my question to the chef. Overall, great service, and that's the only reason for the second star, a very poor dining experience this time around.",

Pavle treats everyone as if they're family and walked us through a tour of the lagos, skirt steak, roasted potatoes, and so much more.  The lagos was a wonderful turkish-inspired bread dish served with enormous orbs of roasted elephant garlic, which we spread \"like butter\", served with a nice cream sauce. It was fantastic.  The skirt steak was perfectly prepared and served over an interesting cold salsa of roasted corn and apricot and some other goodies, with a chimichurri sauce on top. Spot on, and an interesting blend of textures and flavors.  And the potatoes. I did not know you could do such things to potatoes. Roasted and charred perfectly, with a nearly spongy crunch to them, served with delicious melted cheese and an egg on top.  The menu rotates pretty frequently so I won't go into too much detail of the several other dishes we had but I'll say they were all pitch-perfect, up to the amazing butterscotch pudding we had for dessert.  This is one of those special meals that will warm you over as you get to try new approaches to interesting ingredients. Each step is exciting and different and tastes fantastic. I'm not a wine drinker, so I can't comment on the Arizona-only wine selection, but I've heard good things and with everything else being so spot-on, I'd be surprised if it were to be found a shortcoming.  I plan on coming back in the next quarter when the menu shifts up again, but that's only because I'm trying my hardest not to come back immediately and do it all again.",

    "text": "People often comment that various Social Media outlets are a waste of time, brain power and lead to a loss of workplace productivity. For me, sites like Twitter and Facebook are a way to connect with like minded people and stay up to date on news and current events. For the Dwivedi family, Social media turned out to be a lifesaver.  Last night FnB Restaurant in Old Town Scottsdale hosted the \"Tiny Fab Kidney Fund\" late night dinner service to benefit Amy Donohue & The Dwivedi family.  Before getting to the food, a little background on the event. A decade ago, Anu Dwivedi was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease. Six months ago, her kidney function down to twenty percent, she was told the transplant waiting list was up to six years long. (not a prospect that brought comfort to her family).  Anu's foodie daughter Kirti decided to put her social media obsession to use via Facebook with a page she created titled \"Kidney disease and my tiny mother,\" to learn and share her family's experience. Amy Donohue saw the page and decided she could help. She contacted Kirti, got the required tests done and the rest as they say, is history (or will be in the coming weeks when the transplant surgery is done).  In addition to the inspired cuisine FnB is becoming famous for, Chef Charlene Badman whipped up a few Indian inspired dishes in honor of the Dwivedi's. (half of all revenue from food & beverage from 10PM on + 100 percent of the proceeds of a silent auction totaling approximately $1300 went to the Tiny Fab Kidney Fund).  On to the nights food! My appetizer consisted of lightly battered, perfectly fried rock shrimp ($13) served with a well balanced jalapeno tartar sauce (with a hint of Meyer lemon and fresh herbs).  Alongside my rock shrimp was a heaping serving of three varieties of cauliflower , tossed with spanish peanuts, marinated in fish sauce and mint whose soft insides were perfectly complemented by their deep fried crunch. (this dish is simply delicious!)  Next up were a pair of Samosas ($5) filled with creamy sweet potato and accompanied by a small bit of sweet, tangy dipping sauce who's components slip my mind (Blogger/foodie foul).  Grilled spicy broccoli ($8) with pistachio and Meyer lemon aioli is flat out the best thing to ever happen to that humble green vegetable (its because of this dish that I know when broccoli season is).  A piping hot serving of traditional Punjabi Butter chicken (Makhan Wala Murgh) served over Basmati rice rounded out my meal. (I imagine this type of curry to be comfort food in Punjab).  If I had one complaint about the butter chicken it's that I feel the sauce to rice ratio could have been better. The rich, creamy sauce definitely would have benefitted from more rice in my opinion but the flavors were great.  So then, social media is informative, recreational and the bane of workplace performance but you never know, someday it could very well save your life or that of someone you love.  Side note: If you have ever wondered what it's like to experience True hospitality, make a reservation at FnB. Co-owner and front of house manager Pavle Milic is a study in graciousness, sincerity, service and will make you feel as welcome as anywhere you've ever been.",

Get a few cocktails, a few apps, share an entre, and then dessert. Mmmmmm... then come back for lunch and dinner the next day to hopefully try anything you didnt get the chance to try the previous day. I look forward to any occassion to come here to FnB. Hey, look, its friday! Need to celebrate and go to FnB tonight! Yessssssss!",

I also think about a lightness - space, light and comfort.   Unfortunately, this place offered none of these qualities. We were seated in a room near the kitchen that was cramped as it was hot.   The kitchen hood wasn't keeping up with the smoke from grilling, so the room had a cloud of smoke that floated just below the ceiling that reminded me of how bars looked 20 years ago when they were filled with cigarettes.   Forget about getting beer on tap (remember - 'pub!). Only a handful of bottled beers graced an inventive wine list, but alas, that was flawed too - our top choices were sold out.   Did I mention that the temperature in the restaurant was 78 degrees? It was like sitting in your grandmother's living room.   The food kept up the losing trend. The falafel was overcooked. We had a decent app of dumplings of a sort. The pasta with cauliflower was dense and lifeless - maybe it would have been better on a cold windy night, but not so much in the smokey, overheated gastro-sauna.   We were very disappointed.",

    "text": "In Scottsdale for a conference, it appears that the Phoenix-Scottsdale area is (I am repeatedly told) *not* a place for fine dining.  But we found a small, local, and highly recommended restaurant that -- if we're ever back in Arizona (politics notwithstanding) -- we're definitely returning to!  FnB is a small place tucked inside a little courtyard of shops off 5th St.  With an frequently changing menu composed of an assortment of about 10 appetizers, 5-6 sides and only 4-6 entrees, the menu may be small, but never felt limited.  Focused on locally sourced food wherever possible, the food was excellent -- far more \"exciting\" and \"intriguing\" (and with much better service; the waitstaff here is excellent!) than the far more expensive meal we had the night before.  The wine list has about 25-30 different wines from local Arizona producers, as well as wines from elsewhere, but we stuck with the wines from Arizona (OK, one from Washington).  We started off with a Dos Cabezas white blend, \"Meskoli,\" that was light, crisp, fragrant and very nice.  We then shifted north to Washington State for one of my favorite wines, the DeLille Chaleur Estate White, a Sauvignon Blanc-Semillon blend that never fails to satisfy.  The Dos Cabezas Aguileon, a Tempranillo blend, was truly excellent - a wine I'd buy here in Berkeley, if I could find it.    FnB is one of those neighborhood gems that you just treasure and try to keep to yourself . . . and your best friends.  If I lived here, I'd be here every week!  WONDERFUL!",

I have been to highly rated and award winning restaurants around the world, and small local dives to Michelin Starred Gems....this was one of the worst meals I have ever had...all around.  I researched places to eat in the area before making a reservation for this one. In addition, it was recommended to us by a woman who worked at one of the nearby wine tasting rooms.   First off, the atmosphere was awful. The decor is simple and nothing to write home about. Fine...I saw photos online. But if the 2 rooms they have (which I only noticed on the way out or we would have asked to move), they chose to seat us and another couple in the same room a large rambunctious group of 15+ which sat inches away. The noise echoed horribly and we could barely hear each other. Finally, we ended up moving outdoors despite the heat to finish our dinner.   The food courses were ALL underwhelming. I was shocked. We had some kind of chickpea fritter sort of dish which was cold and soggy/chewy and another with watermelon. The watermelon was the shining star of the meal next to the bottle of wine our server, who had no idea what he was talking about in terms of wine, recommended. How do you hire servers at a place known for their wine selection that know nothing about wine?  While looking back to their website, I realize the James Beard Nom was for their wine, not food...which I'd originally thought. I suppose stop by for a glass but stick to ANY of the other restaurants around to eat. Will. Never. Return.",

Starting with the ease of making a reservation online, to the wonderful ambience when we first walked in, FnB delivered on all aspects of our dining  experience.  The waitstaff is kind and helpful, often working together to service our table. They were clearly knowledgeable of the menu, which helped as my party was comprised of lacto-ovo vegetarians. Most of the menu, in fact, was vegetarian so it was difficult for us to make our decisions! The staff also mentioned which items were vegan, or could be made vegan.  Since the menu is seasonal, I won't dwell upon the food other than to mention that it was all superb. Each dish was delectable, from familiar dishes like falafel to new ones like apple sharlotka. Together, my boyfriend and I enjoyed four vegetable dishes and two desserts and spent about $85 with tip (and a coffee with dessert!).   I would certainly go back to FnB again to experience some of the best dining in Old Town Scottsdale.",

The service was great and our server was really knowledgable about both the wine and the food. We were indecisive about what to pick off the menu so we asked our server to basically order dishes for us. He picked things that complimented well together and was just overall delicious (and probably were things we wouldn't have ordered ourselves). He also recommended a wine we ended up loving too.   The menu changes constantly but the dishes we ordered were:  - yuzu cured salmon, wheat noodles, ginger-sesame dressing, tea egg  - beets, melon, pumpernickel croutons, goat cheese, vadouvan - butternut, delicata squash, lime, goat cheese, cumin, mint - langos, liptauer, arugula, marcona almonds - pasta, green beans, schreiner's bacon, potato, pesto, parmesan  We decided to only order one of the main dishes since we weren't interested in getting a big piece of protein. Even the pasta itself, while quite good, wasn't the star. The vegetables actually stood out the most. So fresh and perfectly seasoned! Highly recommend sharing dishes and even going with around 4 people to try as many things as possible. Can't wait to go back!",

We selected FnB based on that they are equally known for showcasing the bounty of Arizona's local terroir with an award-winning wine program according to their website. When in Rome sort of thinking: AZ food and AZ wine while in AZ = sounds great.  Our table of five was crammed with a chair on the end, in the traffic flow, our server didn't know anything about what would be considered the good AZ local terrior plates and wines to share as a group, as promised on their website. Told him we liked CA Cabs and were looking to try AZ wines. He suggested a Grenache that was sooooooo sweet - nothing similar to what we told him we liked at all. So disappointing for a place that \"was nominated in 2017 by the James Beard Foundation for Outstanding Wine Program\".  Maybe they need better training, higher quality of servers or just send a Sommelier over for wine suggestions. Maybe the James Bread nomination is based on whats in the cellar, not the server knowledge and expertise. Food just seemed to be trying too hard to be \"the epicenter of creative Arizona cuisine\". Nothing stood out as OMG delicious or AZ special.  Something should of been OMG out of all the plates we tried.  I mentioned in my OpenTable reservation that it was a special out of town birthday outing. No dessert offering or mention of it at all by our server to see if we wanted something special, which in the end was just fine as we couldn't wait to leave and continue the celebration else where. So disappointing over all.",

    "text": "FnB was our favorite meal during our visit to Scottsdale. Everyone here was incredibly friendly and our server was great! The food was comforting with unexpected but much appreciated surprises.   We started with the summer squash and pickled corn. I have never had pickled corn much less with what I believe to be crushed corn nuts. It was amazing. A little sweet, a little salty, and just a kick of spicy and sour with a corn nut crunch. It kind of reminded me of an amped up chile picante corn nut mix.  For entrees we had the famous fried chicken and  pasta with bacon and fresh pulled mozzarella. Both were great but I loved the cornbread that came with the fried chicken. It tasted like orange zest mixed into some creamy whipped butter.  Great spot and a must try!",

An excellent amount of crunch paired with the sweet and salty squash and bacon was perfection. The bread could have been grilled a bit more. The $12 Bloody Mary was on the small side and lacked flavor. Stick to the $5 southern French rose. Definitely worth it!",

    "text": "This place creates good imaginative food. However our server, a heavily tattooed charming fellow, did not serve us well. The limited but spectacular menu is organized into three sections. There is a wonderful appetizer, salad, small plates section, a shareable vegetable section, and an entree section with only four choices. All spectacular.    I asked my our server if would be appropriate to share one of each course between my very petite wife and myself?  We were two couples sharing a nice table. He highly recommended that we each order an entree and a starter and split only a vegetable per couple. We each shared an appetizer (fabulous chicken spring rolls), shared a vegetable (one couple ordered the cauliflower and the other Brussel sprouts - both great), then we each ordered our own entree. Two chickens, goulash, and swordfish were ordered and enjoyed immensely.   However neither couple could finish more than a third of the vegetables ordered and more then half of the sizable entrees were boxed up.   The food is good enough that we will enjoy our reheated lunches, but when I go to a new (to me) upscale restaurant I would prefer to try more smaller portions and less massive servings. This server didn't understand my goal or was too focused on increasing the check size to care. Perhaps we put him off when we ordered wine by the glass!  It was a Wednesday so not polishing off several bottles of wine seemed reasonable. The fact that he disappeared as soon as the food began coming out and I had to ask a busboy to retrieve our bill makes me think he was just padding our check.   We will never come back and we eat out 3-5 nights a week in the Phoenix area.   The restaurant takes its food seriously. They should focus a little more on the total dining experience. Frankly, I would have preferred to order half a dozen starters, one vegetable, and one or two entrees for the four of us.",

    "text": "I am so glad I made reservations to have dinner here on a Thursday night because it sooooo much easier to find parking than on the weekend when everybody is partying.  Now on to the review of the restaurant: My first impression was very good until I decided to sit at the bar. Now, maybe I was expecting too much but the barkeep did not appear to be as welcoming as the hostess/server. In fact, she did not set a glass of water in front of me until I finally looked her straight in the eye. Maybe I'm mistaken but from what I've been told bartenders are usually more talkative. Unfortunately, the bartender tonight was more interested in chatting with her buddies than making conversation with me. There was no attempt made to converse.  I really wish I had not given up my table. If I do decide to treat myself again at FnB i think I will dine at a table instead. At least at a table I will have plenty of room to spread out and read my book or magazine.  The vittles for this season's menu were very good but nothing to write home about. The current menu offerings are posted online so I think if I do decide to go back I will check the menu first and see if anything catches my eye. But, I will not make a special drive out there like I did this evening. I really wish I had just took a 3 minute drive to one of the local restaurants near me instead of making a 30 minute trek and being disappointed.  The food is solid but not out of this world and service was mediocre at best for my experience. I might try this place again but not anytime soon.",

They clearly are obtaining the best/highest quality/freshest meats and vegetables and doing amazing things with them at reasonable prices.  The chicken is prepared flawlessly and creatively.  The spicy broccoli is excellent (and actually spicy), although the aioli is a bit heavy-handed.  The turnips were a bit underdone/bitter but still tasty nonetheless.  Would love a larger beer and cocktail list.  Service is excellent between a variety of attendants.  Sit at the bar/chef's counter if you can.  Food is the star of the show.  The panna cotta dessert with blueberries is a can't miss.  The reason for the 4 star instead of 5 star review is based on the condition of the restaurant and the bathroom.  Unfortunately, the 4'x2' ceiling tiles are not only ugly, but dirty as well.  More importantly, the air vents, a couple of which are directly over the piles of various food ingredients and prep-area on the chef's counter, are black with dirt/grime/dust.  The thought of that air blowing directly on our food was unappetizing to say the least.  This place needs an entire new ceiling.  The porcelain cats on the counter should be done away with as well.  Also, for a place this big, they have just one solo bathroom, for the clients & staff.  It's kind of run down as well.  Just could/should be done a lot better.  The vibe is great here, both in terms of employees and diners.  Several locals were remembered by the staff, but everyone feels like a local after a few minutes.  We will be back.",

It was a dish of little pastries filled with lamb, served with pomegranate and middle eastern yogurt and cheese. It was a dish I had never eaten before and is something I'm excited to try again, the best dish of the night.   We also had the pasta, spaghetti squash and lamb chops, all of which were excellent.

Pavle and Charleen are certainly an amazing team and it's clear that each of them is passionate about what they do. Pavle's hospitality and knowledge shine as he takes you through the menu and makes sure you're comfortable and well taken care of throughout the evening. Charleen is a master in the kitchen and turns out the most amazing plates. Veggies never tasted so good!  The atmosphere is intimate yet fun. From the moment you enter FnB you're treated as a friend. I've been a happy customer since it's near beginnings, and I've always had a perfect experience when dining there.  As far as menu specifics? Get the butterscotch pudding! Even if you weren't expecting to get dessert you shouldn't pass it up. Also, most of the time, my husband and I go the small plate route (and maybe order an entree to split as well). We love how everything sounds--and we're pretty good about sharing--so we find that ordering small plates is the most exciting dining experience for us. If you're not so experienced with wine, don't worry! Pavle will help you. I told him I had no idea what I liked with wine and he responded, \"Of course you know what you like! If you know what you like in food, you know what you like in wine.\" Again, the unshakably friendly demeanor you can expect at FnB, even if you're not an experienced oenophile.",

But, I was just as happy with the fresh bread and (so good that it's) green, flavorful EVOO.  We had the Halibut, Broccoli and a special of prawns. The broccoli was something worth writing home about. I'm going to try to duplicate at home. As the girl next to me at the counter said, \"it's the best broccoli you've ever had times 100.\" The Halibut was lovely. Cooked perfectly, lightly seasoned and served under a salad featuring kumquats from the chef's neighbor's garden. That's local!  One of the more interesting, engaging dining experiences that I've had in a long, long time. Reserve a seat at the FnB counter immediately, if you like fresh, inventive, local, in season food with impeccable presentation.   *Except for the Gastropub part, the food is too light, fresh and the setting more intimate than a gpub.",

    "text": "When I knew that I was coming to Scottsdale to attend an event, I started looking up places that I should try and this one came with the best reviews. We called to make a reservation the evening that we were going, and they told us that they would call us back with a time. Sure enough, in five minutes we received a call that there was a spot open for that evening.    We were seat and greeting within a couple of minutes of arriving by Nathan. About 15 minutes into our dining experience there were a group of intoxicated girls that sat at the table next to us and were very loud.   There were 3 of us that were in our party and we ordered the lamb, fish, and pasta. We all shared the grilled broccoli. I enjoy the braised lamb with the rice. The broccoli has nice flavor to it and would recommend to anyone that eats here. For dessert, we had the chocolate cake which was a nice finish to a good meal. I would give the food 4 stars.  As we were brought our dessert, I asked the women that brought it out if there was some way that the girls that were still next could quiet down. They were loud and the service staff saw playing into them causing them to be louder. She went and told our server and he did nothing about. I never heard from from anyone in the restaurant. For this reason, I give them 0 stars on the service side of the meal.  I feel that this could have been a good meal if it wasn't for the drunk girls next to us.",

    "text": "Just ate here for the first time last night for my birthday dinner and it was PHENOMINAL!! I don't think I've ever had a meal with so many different flavors in every single course, all of which were perfectly balanced and blended together.  And my wife isn't usually one to try a lot of unique dishes like the ones featured at FnB, so she was a bit hesitant to even go here, but she absolutely loved everything - and that's saying a lot!  We started off with the world-famous braised leeks, which were perfectly cooked (hard to do with leeks), and the combination of flavors with the egg and the mustard panko smothered in mozzarella (which they make themselves) was amazing.   Then for the main course I got the pasta and my wife got the halibut, and we split a side order of the rutabaga (sadly, they were out of the spicy broccoli).  The pasta  - WOW!! It has so much going on with the bacon, chanterelles, tarragon and a wonderful creme fraiche-based sauce, that I couldn't decide what I liked best about it.  And the halibut w/cauliflower and chermoula was out of this world, and my wife liked it so much that all I got was a few small bites.   And then we finished off the meal with two desserts.  The first was a few scoops of roasted banana ice cream sandwiched between two pizzeles with rum raisins and chocolate fudge. It was very good except for the fact that the ice cream was slightly bitter, which makes me think they either used bananas which weren't ripe enough or they didn't roast them long enough. But then again, I'm comparing it to my own roasted banana ice cream that I make which is out of this world, so I'm a tough critic when it comes to that. :) HINT: use 6-8 well-ripened bananas (showing just a few brown spots) chopped up and tossed with a mix of 3/4C brown sugar and 2T rum & 2T butter, roasted @ 325F for 25 mins, for every 2qt of ice cream.    The second dessert was a black walnut & pear cake with a side of creme fraiche whipped cream.  I don't think I've ever had black walnuts before, and the flavor is SO good and SO different than regular walnuts, and the subtle sweetness of the pears was a nice contrast.  I highly recommend it.  All in all it was one of the best dining experience that I have ever had, and I have eaten at  lot of very nice restaurants including Le Jules Verne (at the top of the Eiffel Tower) and French Laundry (in Napa). And the prices were very reasonable for being such a quaint restaurant with such eclectic cuisine.  If this restaurant were located in a place like NYC, Napa, Paris or even a high-end shopping plaza in Scottsdale, you would easily pay $200-$300+ for this type of meal, but here in this small side-street gem of a restaurant our total bill came out to a mere $98 (not including drinks, tax or tip). I can't wait to come back again and try some new things since the menu is constantly changing according to the season. I also hope to stop by for one of their \"Late Night Love\" events to try some of their unique one-off meals.",

My husband and I love coming here, and we love bringing friends here to try the awesome food.  Some noteworthy highlights since the last review:  --We attended the vegetarian night here in January. Of course I loved every bite, but what was really cool to me was that the restaurant was completely sold out that evening. That says a lot about Charleen's way with vegetables. Absolute magic!  --We finally got over our fear of AZ wine and tried a bottle of the Dos Cabezas El Campo, included in the  SF Chronicle's top 100 wines of 2012. The Dos Cabezas Syrah that went with veg dinner was great too.  --FnB has moved to Baratin's old digs. I miss sitting at the counter but love the bigger space. Hopefully we'll make it to the Frank Sinatra table one day.",

For an appetizer we enjoyed the Lamb Manti, which is a combination of a dumpling and ravioli.  The lamb filling is seasoned with mint and cilantro garnished with pomegranate, yoghurt and pine nuts. The flavors are fantastic, we loved it!  The beet salad with horseradish vinaigrette had an amazing zing to the pallet, very different, and is the perfect salad course.  The pasta entree with sausage was perfectly cooked and had great flavors.  We talked about this dish the next day!  Really should not be missed.  So simple and so well executed.  The staff does an excellent job with food and wine description along with wine pairing by the glass.  100% of the wines by the glass are sourced from Arizona.

After enjoying some complimentary fresh bread (delicious!), I dived into a bowlful of shishito peppers with crema and some grilled okra with hazelnuts. The okra was amazing!

    "text": "This was a great local find.  I was in Scottsdale for the night and wanted to find something more intimate and more bistro like with healthy options and Yelp led me this direction.  They also open later and being on west coast time it just ended up I was always eating later than normal.  When I first walked into this place I noticed that there are two sections to sit, one is an area where there is a bar with other tables nearby, and then there is more of a dining room next to the bar.  Since it was late and causal I opted to go for the bar area.  It turned out great as the service was just as good and it had more interesting people on the bar side.  I won't go into details but lets just say there was a passionate couple sitting at the bar and it definitely provided entertainment value watching them make out for an hour straight. No eating no drinking just doing their MO.  Watching the waitress dance around them with serving was pretty funny.  Anyway that said the menu offers a lot of very innovative dishes many are vegetarian, a few are vegan.  They can also modify the menu pretty easily.  The dishes we had and I recommend them all highly is wild greens with pickled jalapenos, and a creamy rice underneath.  This dish was incredible with the mixture of vegetables, spices and creaminess you get with a risotto dish.  I almost didn't believe this was dairy free.  It was like major comfort food aka crack.  The other pasta dish they had on the menu was very simple with veggies but it again was so flavorful.  I also recommend the brussels sprouts with curry lime and the arugula salad was simple but great.  They have a nice wine list and local beers.  the service is very friendly and attentive even though it was pretty late at night.  Will definitely be back as I hear they change up the menu often.  Oh and the prices I thought for Cali standards was very reasonable.  Yes the dishes were mostly veggies but with all the layers of flavors they all had it was totally reasonable.",

We had a fresh butter lettuce salad with radishes and jalapeno, Peruvian spring rolls, and duck empanadas.  The butterscotch pudding was to die for.  Even the wine list is hyper local (I didn't even know they had wines in Arizona). While the server was kind enough to let us try some of the local wines, we opted for a California blend instead.    Service was attentive, knowledgeable, and low key.  Ambience is a bit loud, very focused on the food and not much else.  But that's the way it should be at a place like this.

Need to retrain employees on this or specify that you won't split checks as a policy. I work in the food industry, my family owned a restaurant in NYC for 20+ years, so I do understand the etiquette. I was polite about it as a courtesy to my server, and asked about it as SOON as we were seated. Server was being straight up lazy.   Literally 10 other places during my stay in Scottsdale accommodated the split checks for much larger parties.   Manager if you are reading this: a quick conversation to the servers on this would be appreciated. If you are a manager or owner who feels this is a picky BS review and it won't effect your business by not addressing w/staff: I'll look you up in 10 years and see who's renting your space at that point. These small things matter.  Any excuse about the plating system doesn't apply guys. We could have put a few of the plates on each of our checks if that was going to be your out for the bad service.",

We had a 1215 reservation for lunch for 7 people. The menu seems very simple. Only offered 1 option for anything. 1 salad, 1 veg, 1 sandwich, 1 pasta. After we were seated, it took another 10-15 minutes for us to get our order taken. Once the order was taken, this is where the waiting really begins. After 35 minutes, the food finally came out at 1:10pm. We were literally sitting there for almost an hour with no food in front of us. In fact, there was a couple outside playing cards waiting until their food to arrive. Clearly they have been there before and know the etiquette for waiting for lunch.   I was truly embarrassed as I picked the place with the understanding it had great food. Once the food finally came, it did look good and my team seem to like their food. But for a lunch time offering, we needed to get back to work and there is no way anyone has over an hour to eat lunch. Not sure i would ever return.",

All three appetizers were shared and delicious. Who the hell thought of combining fish sauce with harissa?  I guess a really good chef at this restaurant did, and it made the mussels amazing. Entrees of chicken, pork shoulder and carrot risotto were all great. Eat of us tasted the other's food and there was no loser in the ordering department.  A great evening with good food well prepared and good wine. P S: Dessert didn't suck! We would definitely come back here if in town again.",

I'll admit, my wife and I moved from the Phoenix area just before Pavle & Co jumped to their Baratin location, so I can't vouch for the vibe and atmosphere of the new place. I can however vouch for the fact that we only had 2 dishes that disappointed over approximately a dozen visits. Their championing of Arizonan wines is brave, and ultimately a brilliant move, given that there are now so many incredible wines coming out of that state. The most amazing thing at FnB however, is the dizzying array of vegetable dishes that Chef Charlene would create - the Leeks and Grilled Broccoli standing out immediately in my mind. Pavle is undoubtedly the most charming host you'll ever meet - if he ends up serving your table, you'll see what I mean. We miss this place so much... When we next are in the PHX area, we'll have another visit to FnB inked into our schedule.",

This is ultimate comfort food for me - with the bulk of the menu highlighting local in-season organic vegetables from McClendon and other local farms. Charleen prepares dishes that pay the ultimate homage to the vegetable and the farmer with perfect seasoning, contrast, balance and temperatures.   Beyond vegetables, the housemade burrata was light as a cloud and shrimp grilled to perfection on the mesquite. Dishes at FnB are simple but often the simplest dishes are the hardest to get right as there is nothing to hide behind - ingredients have to be fresh and of the highest quality and execution must be perfect. Charleen and her crew strike it out of the park almost every time.  Service is professional, attentive and friendly. Pavle and his team make you feel right at home, which is the other reason why I would happily eat here everyday.",

I do not like pretentious restaurants, which are \"in\" for a couple of months, and then change after the initial reviews. That said, when a good friend wanted to try FNB, I was good to go - but in my mind I was somewhat hesitant, wondering if it was one of those places that had a rush of good reviews, then service, ambiance and quality would slide.  I need not have worried.  I was impressed. After walking by the front  door,  Pavl was standing in the door and greeted us. I had never met him before, but he is one of those genuinely nice, warm human beings that love the world, and everyone in it. I did not have a reservation, but he immediately sat us and truly made us welcome.  It was like dining in some one's home - everyone made us feel at home, and actually seemed concerned about our evening and the meal.  I had the Alaskan Halibut and it was outstanding.  I also tried the Jadori chicken, and it too was wonderful (I had not ordered it - it was half a chicken, and I would have ended up with it in my lap). Of course,  I am a beer drinker, and their choices were limited, which I had expected - but they did have a beer brewed in Prescott, which was fine.  They are known for their wines, and they had an extensive wine list of different local wines available, which I understand are quite good.  It is rather expensive, but the atmosphere, food, and service make it reasonable.  And yes, even if you don't know him before you go in, Pavl will seem like an old friend by the time you leave.",

The atmosphere is cool, kind of old school diner-y but with a laid back sophistication.  I liked it.  Our server came by to offer us drinks and mentioned that his favorite red was from the vineyard of Maynard James Keenan.  Who knew?  Well, he does have a good voice so I decided to give it a go.  And it was pretty good.  I like how the chef is not afraid to offer non traditional dishes.  We decided to share a few, including the chopped chicken liver, smoked trout, crispy rock shrimp and jalapeno tartar, and asparagus, cauliflower puree and crispy beets.  Everything was simply prepared and delicious, like comfort food.  I like this place.  It's mellow but still cool and has great service.  I'll be back when I'm in the mood for something different.",

I have no doubt everything was made to order using only the highest quality local ingredients, but I found it a little too fru fru.  Same with the entrees with the exception of the pork chop.  I love the look of this place and I love how helpful and friendly the staff was especially the owner (at least I think he was the owner or something).  I also love the idea behind this place - a place that specializes in quality Arizona foods AND wines.  And the final clincher as to why I am a fan of this place (and probably most importantly) is because my wife loves it.

It's a smaller place, I like being able to see into the kitchen, but I feel like they need a little more space. It can be too cramped for groups larger than 4 - and even 4 can be a stretch.   But the food is incredible. It's locally grown and it's so hard to pick when you're looking at the menu. The only solution is multiple trips.  And if that's not enough, the service is phenomenal. Our waiter (and also owner I believe) was extremely helpful. He described the menu items to us in mouthwatering detail. And when I asked him to pair a glass of wine to my dinner, he took the time to really consider it and ask me about my tastes and found a wine that I absolutely loved. So much in fact that after the rough day I'd had, I asked him to bring me another glass. I joked \"I don't know how much it costs but it was so good I don't care. No, don't tell me, I don't want to know - I just know after the long day I had I deserve another glass.\" He laughed at that and then a few minutes later he came around and topped my glass off, instead of charging me for a full second glass. I really appreciate little things like that. That one move pretty much solidified me being a long-term customer.  Try FnB. You won't be disappointed.",

And unlike some other uber popular restaurants - you can believe the hype. The service was wonderful, the food was rich and complex, and the whole experience was satisfying.   A few comments -   It was really warm in there. I'm sure it's tough to keep such a small place cool with the kitchen in the middle of the room. I was fine with the temperature through most of the meal but by the end I was ready to go.   Drinks - we were offered water to start and were given a rundown of the \"mocktails\" they had available. (FNB is byob). But we were never offered anything else - it left my dinner companion and I wondering - do they serve other beverages - tea, coffee, soda? There was nothing on the menu.

Wow who knew that all went together.  I had the chicken they have this summer and it was just so flavorful.  The dessert is good, but not over the top (but some times I LOVE over the top).  Such a lovely dinner.  I will say I don't think it's for kids.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I dined for the first time Sunday night at 8pm. When we walked threw the front door and entered the tiny dining space I immediately noticed something that set them apart from the restaurants located on the same block, and that was every seat filled with happy people on a Sunday night.  As the night went on I found the food and the wine to be great, but the best part of the evening (besides my girlfriend of course) was the personal touch the owners give to there guests. It's not any one thing, but the fact that they are hands on (which in my opinion works best in this business) is what made the night for me. To see the chef/owner throwing down behind the line and at the same time answering guest's questions on methods and ingredients and also owner/hostess/waitress/manager she is really something, seating people ,answering the phone, taking orders, and managing the awesome staff and still having time to chat with us. I have been in this business for 16 years and have never been apart of something as special as FnB.  Make a reservation, try the Pillsbury Diva and Enjoy!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "FnB you've got my full attention!  Okay foodies, I'm sure you've read about FnB in the past months or so.  In the place of where Digestif used to be, hails a new victor in culinary truth. In a quaint yet sophisticated space featuring a remarkably glossy multicolored artlike tile floor,  FnB features a  menu that changes sometimes daily with the freshest produce, all from local Arizona farmers.  They also use other fresh ingredient from local vendors.  The freshness certainly shows in the taste and integrity of their food, it is so delicious!  I had been looking to come here ever since I saw a picture on facebookof their braised leeks/mozzarella/mustard breadcrumbs and fried egg phenomenon!  People, this is food porn worthy in my books.  One glimpse of that dish and I simply knew I was destined to dine there.  So, with a drooling comment on my friend Jay's picture status, I begged him to PLEASE call me the next time you want to go to FnB!!   Happily for me, that day came about a week later :) Upon arrival we took a seat at the bar.  You could call this a bar, but I call it a food voyeur's naughty pleasure.  You see, the whole kitchen is surrounded by the bar, so if you choose to sit there you'll get to watch Charleen Badman work her magic while enjoying a nice glass of Arizona wine.  We were warmly greated by Pavle Milic, the restaurant's owner and also our server for the evening.  We both got the \"Vino del Barrio Blanca\"  ($10.0/glass) from Pages Springs Vineyards right here in AZ.  We then ordered up two appetizers to share and relaxed with friendly conversation.  Of course, we ordered the braised leeks/mozz/breadcrumb/fried egg ($13.0).  We also tried their duck/pork pate which was a new addition to their changing menu.  Both were amazing, but I must pay close attention to the best salty and savory thing I ever ate in my life!  Yes, I just said \"best...thing I ever ate,\" because it is True.  That leek dish changed me forever, as I now crave it in my sleep, it was that amazing!  I watched as Charleen put the fresh mozzarella over the leeks and stuck it under the broiler.  Then,  she prepared the out of the broiler, slid the egg on top and dusted with the mustard breadcrumbs.  over easy egg in a small saucepan over an even smaller double burner, giving it a generous sprinkle of salt on top.  When the cheese was perfectly melted over the leeks, she pulled it   I really could dedicate my whole article on this one plate, as it was for me, perfection.  The perfectly cooked greens, the melted stringy cheese, breadcrumbs,  and maybe my favorite part...the crispy around the edges, over easy egg! It had a salty, savory, creamy, slightly chewy,  and warm flavor in every bite.  I'm pretty sure they saw me scraping the plate to get the crusted mozzarella off!  Oh my god, it was just unbelievable.  When you go to FnB, you'd be a fool not to order this delight.  Next was the duck/pork pate.  It came on the plate with two pieces of crispy bread, a few softly roasted cippolini onions, some pickled cauliflower and cucumber and a dollop coarse ground mustard.  This pate was very nicely put together with the perfect amount of fat content and seasoning.  The pate also had pistachios in it that gave a nice texture contrast.  It really tasted like my dad's liverwurst that he's been making for years from an old world German recipe.  For me to be able to compare it to something  homemade and authentic from my dad's market, makes it top notch in my book!  The onions were great, as you could smear them onto the hard crusty bread and accompany with a piece of pate. I loved the bi-colored pickled cauliflower, it was delicious  For the entree it was a hard decision as all of the four entrees on the menu looked amazing.  We went with sharing the flat iron steak with cauliflower, caper, and golden raisin salsa verde ($21.0)  I totally didn't realize until we got our entree that Pavle didn't ask us how we wanted our meat cooked and I'm very glad that he didn't.  This steak was cooked to an absolute perfection.  Nice sear on the outside with a juicy red medium doneness on the inside.  It had a very clear, pure beefy flavor and just melded so nicely with the caper raisin salsa.  You'll notice we had cauliflower twice that evening, but that was not a problem at all as it was so different each time we got it.  In the pate dish it was cold and pickled. In our entree we were given a beautiful purple cauliflower that was roasted  with what tasted to me like some fresh grated parmesan, but I cannot be positive of this.  Either way, I really enjoyed the distinct flavors of the cauliflower each time, it was really great.   When we thought we could feast no more we told Pavle we'd be skipping dessert.  However, Pavle simply wouldn't let us leave without something homemade and sweet in our stomachs.  Such a kind man to make sure my sweet tooth is paid attention to ;) ...read full review on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ErinForney.com&s=0f244e1a8a6445310b36330fa14c4d09247b3b99d55c8c1852f98117af281e81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">ErinForney.com</a>",

    "text": "We went last night and loved the place! FnB took over the old Sea Saw space next to Cowboy Ciao in old town Scottsdale. You will love Pavle and staff. They are the kindest people. We tried the meat and cheese plate and crispy rock shrimp with jalapeno tartar and loved them. The cheese plate comes out with the best tasting fresh baked bread. The shrimp is very crisp and flavorful with the jalapeno dip. I don't even like jalapenos, but love this dip!   We only stayed for drinks and apps. The rest of the menu looked excellent. I had to look up what gastropub meant and it truly describes the menu. It is like gourmet comfort foods. The place is a small cozy place with a bar area where you can sit and watch the chefs cook your meal. I felt like we were in a little bistro in New York. It's like being in a intimate restaurant and watching the chefs (like the food network).  We watched the chefs prepare several of the entrees and they smelled and looked really good. I saw the roast chicken dish, braised lamb and the boneless trout go buy and wanted to grab the plates out of the staff's hands. I think all the Foodies will love this place.  We will go back again and I'm going to go for the entrees!",

Like night and day; this place was the polar opposite of its neighbor.  The service was terrific and the food very good.  They seem to change their menu regularly, so by the time you visit, they may have none of the dishes that we had.  For starters, we had the meatball dish and the braised leeks.  Both were delicious and I thought the meatballs were phenomenal.  For the entree I had the bucatini and my best girl had chicken.  Again, both dishes were delicious, and the portion size of the chicken was more than my wife could finish, so we left with an extra meal in hand.  The staff people were very helpful and friendly, and all told, we had a really nice meal.  Next time we're in the area, we'll make a return visit.",

This is my favorite kind of spot -- with excellent food and service, but without any of the pretentiousness that is often found at top restaurants.    The food was inventive and excellent.  The braised leaks lived up to the high marks given by others.  Our lamb entree was also a highlight.    The service was super.  Joshua was friendly and engaging.  We took all his recommendations on ordering and was very happy with his choices.

The menu changes with the season, so I apologize in advance for making your mouth water by mentioning  food you'll probably never taste.   We started off with the appetizer special, Fried Squash blossoms stuffed with burrata served with fresh tomato sauce, and an order of naan with eggplant puree.  The Naan plate was nothing special, but the blossoms were fantastic.  For dinner Hottie had the lab chops with couscous and I had the pasta with butternut squash and pesto.   The pasta was amazing, I watched the chef make my pesto to order... mmmm basil!  Hottie devoured every bite, so I would say he enjoyed his chops too.  For desert we shared the panna cotta with cherries, it was the perfect ending to a great meal.  This place gets 5 starts all the way, from the moment we walked in, the service was impeccable and the food was superb.  Thank you FnB",

    "text": "Charleen Badman is often cited as the best female chef in Arizona.  She's been nominated 5 consecutive years (including this year) as Southwest Chef of the Year by the James Beard Foundation.  To add to her numerous accolades, Charleen & her FnB team won top prize at the 2018 Devour Culinary Classic (the super bowl of AZ culinary festivals).  FnB had been on my radar for awhile, but their recent triumph at Devour made a visit here all the more urgent.  As I write this today, its International Women's Day.  What better day to grab a meal from supposedly the best female chef in the state.  Arriving at 5pm, I was mostly clueless about this place, but intrigued.  FnB is somewhat hidden in Old Town Scottsdale, so I'll make getting there simple for you.  Goto Citizen Public House, then walk one block directly east and you'll be right on top of it.  FnB is essentially four different spaces in one.  In the front entry is a small bar area, followed by the main bar, followed by the main dining room that overlooks the kitchen.  And of course the outside patio if you prefer that option.  Altogether I'm thinking seating for about 100 or so.  As I was here on my own this go around, I opted for the small bar area.  From 3pm-5pm they actually have the small bar open for light bites & drinks, but the main event doesn't start until 5pm (thus why I waited).  Charleen co-owns the business with Pavle Milic.  Charleen runs the kitchen while Pavle is mixing & mingling with the customers whilst educating them on FnB's extensive wine offerings (quite literally hundreds of different bottles of wines to choose from).  Most of their wine is sold by the bottle, but they do have a limited number of wines offered by the glass.  I'm a red guy & their 2013 Oliver Winery Syrah Blend sounded right up my alley.  A smooth medium bodied wine that was so good I got two glasses of it.  I also got a free bread & olive oil snack to start (the bread is made by the valley's very own Noble Bread Company).  Charleen's reputation as a world class chef is largely earned by her ability to extract the absolute maximum flavor from the fruits & vegetables she sources from Arizona farmers.  In fact it's earned her the nickname Veggie Badman (which also just happens to be her Instagram moniker, but I digress).  The menu here changes seasonally, but always has a heavy tilt towards fruits & veggies moreso than the meat dishes.  As such, I asked the bartender for recommendations on perennial & popular items.  The first item she recommended was their Oranges dish.  Orange slices, honey, bee pollen, basil, pistachios, & yuzu kosho (a type of Japanese chili seasoning).  The presentation is a gorgeous kaleidoscope of color on a plate and is phenomenally delicious.  The honey elements do a great deal to mellow the tartness of the fruit & give it a more savory flavor.  For my second dish, I got their Peruvian Chicken Spring Rolls.  The chicken is cooked with an assortment of herbs & mixed with pecans, then wrapped in a fried egg roll atop a bed of aji amarillo pepper aioli.  Fantastic.  The aioli was spicy but manageable & mixed wonderfully with the chicken and the rolls cut easily with a spoon.  Wanting to save room for dessert but still hungry for one more plate, I opted for what the two bartenders both told me was their favorite item on the menu.  The Cauliflower.  Heirloom cauliflowers topped with brown butter & mustard seed sitting atop a bed of almonds & fresh made ricotta cheese.  Wow, wow, wow.  The cauliflowers themselves were perfectly cooked with just the right amount of char, but the brown butter & ricotta elevated this in a way I never expected.  Truly a dish where Charleen's veggie whisperer reputation is well deserved.  To finish, the bartender offered me a dessert menu, but almost immediately said there's only one dessert item worth considering.  FnB's most popular dessert dish is apparently their Butterscotch Pudding with whipped cream & nutmeg.  I'm not usually a big butterscotch fan so I was skeptical.  After the first spoonful of butterscotch & cream, I changed my tune.  Rich, sweet, smooth, perfect.  It's a good thing I opted for the cauliflower instead of a meat dish as I never would've finished this otherwise.  Total cost for my two glasses of wine, 4 dishes, tax, and tip came to about $90.  The light bites menu from 3pm-5pm is such that you could get a decent meal and drink for about $20, but Yelp accurately touts FnB as a $$$ type restaurant during the rest of the evening.  I knew that it would be pricey going in, so I have no bones about that.  And honestly it was worth every penny.  Charleen is incredibly creative with her flavor mixes (particularly on her fruit & veggies) & presentation.  Having left full & joyous from a gloriously delicious meal, I can confirm Chef Charleen is indeed worthy not only of being considered the best female chef in the state.  But a strong contender for best chef in the state of AZ, period.",

Love the way they rotate the menu and use food that is in season.  Every dish was colorful and flavorful.    The service was fantastic.  Our server gave us some awesome suggestions but really allowed us to order what we thought looked good.  They cleared our dishes quickly after every \"round\" and made sure our drinks were always full-water and \"not water\".  The highlight of my night was the butterscotch.  I think I could've asked for one to go in my purse.  It was the BEST butterscotch I've had in 8 years.  If you are in Scottsdale, you need to try FnB.  I know I plan to the next time I am in town.",

    "text": "While visiting Arizona this weekend, our friends said they wanted us to experience this establishment.  They said they had been wanting to try it as it had been recently awarded Restaurant of the Year by some publication.  Unfortunately dinner did not live up to expectations.  We arrived at 6pm for our reservation and were immediately seated in the bar where there were 3 other small tables and about 8-10 at the bar.  The chairs were made out of pop metal, and were incredibly uncomfortable.  I soon  realized that the bartender was not only mixing drinks for the rest of the restaurant, but he was also the server for the tables.  By the time he got to taking our order it was obvious he was overwhelmed.  When I asked him what type of pasta was used in a dish, he replied he didn't know.  Never said \"Let me go find out for you\" He was much more helpful with the wine selection.  We were finally served our entrees at 730.  Food was OK, but certainly nothing to write home about.  On the way out at 815 I mentioned to the host/manager that the poor bartender was having a hard time.  He said \"Oh I'm sending another person over there right now.\"  I told him it was a little late for that.  In hindsight I should have refused the table in the bar and asked to be seated in the restaurant.",

I am a pretty decent chef myself, so when i eat out i want to have something that I do not have the skillset to make at home. It could be from certain knife skills, presentation, or the sourcing of food. FnB hit the spot on all three of those categories. Their food was reasonably priced  considering that it is top notch!  When we came we ordered all vegetarian dishes which was great. They have many options for the omnivores. Also if you ask the waiter to make you a vegetarian dish the chef will make you one that will please your palate and eyes.   Can't wait to come again!",

    "text": "This was a fun experience. We love trying local favorites and the main reason we went to FnB was because of the ratings on yelp. This restaurant recommends that you order 4 dishes per couple. We had the chicken spring rolls and a chorizo appetizer (I forget the name)...both were great; however, I think we preferred the spring rolls. Next we tried the ratatouille which a a great flavor but we didn't expect it to be cold...we thought it would be warm?? Then for our entrees, my husband had the halibut, which he loved and I had the chicken. The chicken was great with a fantastic flavor and it was paired with potatoes and grilled/sauteed peppers. The only thing I wasn't overly thrilled with was how MANY peppers were in the chicken dish...I'm not opposed to the peppers, there was just entirely too many. NOW.....by this point, I really didn't need dessert, especially since i couldn't even finish my dinner; HOWEVER, I wish I would have started with dessert first!!!! I had the toasted cornbread with peaches and mint ice cream!!!! SO AMAZING!!!!! The hubs had lychee sorbet and he loved it. This was a great restaurant....the only reason I gave FnB 4 stars was because I didn't think it was as amazing as all of the reviews. Very good...but I have had better",

They say you eat with your eyes first, and this could not be more True when it came to the food here. Vibrant colours and melange of textures were shown with each dish.

Its just refreshing to taste unique textures that is palatable while pushing the boundaries of exploration. More so, it expands into the curiosity mindset on how basic ingredients can unite together with such harmony on a plate.  Some people in this world just have that special gift that allows them to be artistic and creative on a plate.  I applaud these chefs.   I ordered the grouper fish paired with cauliflower.  Again, the unison of protein and vegetable with the medium of sauce is just sublime.  Definitely recommend the grouper fish dish.  I also enjoyed the mussels.  It wasn't rubbery, which tends to happen when you over cook it.  The taste was light and flavorful.  You can definitely take bread to the sauce and wipe it clean.  The grilled bread with the ricotta cheese is interesting as well.  The seemingly thick but crispy bread was absolutely nice.    I feel that this restaurant found its way on delivering dishes that is mapped out quite well. Taste, texture, and service is well thought out here.  Especially when the server took notice of our sharing and split our entrees.  Love it when people are mindful of such details.    I would recommend anyone to stop by this establishment and enjoy a memorable meal.    **You may want to call in to inquire about its location since its not visible from the streets.**",

For starters, the incredibly friendly, personable, and attentive owner / host makes you feel like you are eating at his private home instead of a restaurant. He was funny, informative, and always attentive to our questions and needs. Beyond that, their chef is truly an artist with the way she is able to construct complex but perfectly balanced flavor profiles with each and every dish. During our dinning experience we must have ordered at least half of the items on the menu, which were each very distinct and delightful. The wine selection at FnB is vast and perfectly compliments whichever menu items you and your party settle on. Not only is their food outstanding, but knowing that they pride themselves in finding locally sourced ingredients adds another layer to the experience. FnB will provide you with an incredible fine dinning experience, which I advise you to plan ahead and secure a reservation. I can't wait to come back soon and see what amazing new dishes they are cooking up next.   P.S. Happy to be the 500th review. Keep up the outstanding work!",

He called to make the reservation for 15 of my friends, as I wanted everyone to enjoy the food and have a great experience with me. The manager Zoey, who made the reservation had asked if we wanted to do a large party menu (family style) or just have the regular menu for everyone. The large party menu was $60 per person not including alcohol. I had told my boyfriend I didn't want to put a price minimum on my birthday (even though I knew most of my friends would spend well over that) just for the few people who weren't comfortable spending close to what would be $100 per person if they were drinking alcohol. She accepted the reservation. The next day she called and said she gave the wrong information and that we would HAVE to spend the minimum per person with the family style menu to dine there. Now, I work at a high end restaurant and never would turn away business for this reason. So I called and spoke to Zoey, while she was very friendly, she told me she would not accommodate our reservation. Even after I explained to her that this was my favorite restaurant, and that I really wanted to spend my birthday with them and we would be patient and make things easy on the servers. She continued to say the owners would not allow it and their grill wasn't big enough (sounds like they're under staffed to me). Really, not big enough for 15 people?! I also told her my friends would spend well over the minimum, I just didn't want to have that as a stipulation to my birthday dinner and give a negative vibe to the few people who would prefer not to spend close to $100 per person. To me, this seems like a very snobby restaurant that isn't interested in business if they are not going to spend the amount they want them to spend. I find it astounding that owners would want to turn away business of 15 paying customers on a Saturday night. I spoke to a few managers I know in the food and beverage business and they said they would NEVER turn people away like that. I told her I was very disappointed and she ended the phone call by saying \"I hope you enjoy your birthday somewhere else!\". Gee, thanks for telling me that after I had 15 people planning to come to your restaurant! What was once one of my favorite restaurants, is now my least favorite due to the bad taste in my mouth after this issue. Looks like we'll be spending our money at The Mission on Saturday, another one of my favorites!",

I think the problem is that most of the food we ordered was just OK.   The wine selection is good, I ordered a glass of red and it complemented the meal :)  We started with the duck eggs and olive goo. It was okay, but not amazing. Essentially, duck eggs with olive tepenade on a bed of greens. eh.  We also ordered the broccoli. It was better than normal broccoli, but it wasn't amazing enough that I would go back for it again. I liked the flavor of the aioli which was special and something that you should try if you go, but don't go just for this side dish.  For the main course, we got the chicken. It was fine, not great but not bad either. The food just didn't stand up to the hype...until the dessert.  The special that night was cornbread with whipped cream, ice cream, and strawberries. This. Was. DELICIOUS. I would go ONLY for dessert here. They really know their sweets. Do NOT skip out on dessert if you come here!  The service was great and I really enjoyed the waiters which is why they get the bump to 4 stars.",

    "text": "My wife continues to be the 'Yelp Queen'.  Many of our best restaurant discoveries while traveling are due to her ability to find these kinds of gems among the rubble of restaurants scattered around the city.  She finds them, I write about them.  This one gets 5 stars!  FnB presents original, gourmet foods like you'd see on those Top Chef TV shows, thanks to Chef and part owner Charleen Badman.  The description from their FnB website says:\"With a farm-focused menu and exclusive Arizona wine list housed in a charming, intimate setting, FnB has won the trust of diners the world over with its constantly-evolving, locally-sourced menu and a hospitable, unpretentious staff and setting.\"  It would be wrong to say that the menu is of a single ethnic style or a specific culinary influence - it's not French, it's not Southwestern, it's not Greek or Mediterranean, and it's not asian seafoods.  Rather, it's exciting American cooking that includes all of those styles.  Chef Charleen draws from ingredients that are locally grown and that change with the growing seasons.  And what a treat it was!  Appetizers included duck eggs or lamb manti with yogurt, urfa butter, pine nuts and pomegranate or a cheese spread plate with crispy pita bread along with marcona almonds and elephant garlic.  We ordered several dishes priced between $8 and $15.  We sampled the sweet squash with coconut milk dressing and thai hatch chili relish.  We had roasted carrots with cardamon raita and cashews. I had a meat-filled filo shell that had hints of cinnamon, honey and pistachios.  Everything we tasted was over-the-top delicious and original.  We even lusted after the dishes brought to the neighboring tables - razor clams, pasta with sicilian sausage and even scallops.  It all looked so good and by the smiles on the other customer's faces told the same story - it was all fresh, original and delicious!  The staff was equally fun.  Shantal and Nate served us well and patiently described menu items, made wine recommendations from the Arizona wine list (yes, I was skeptical but they were VERY good!) as well attending to us in a warm, friendly fashion.  Then, just as we were about to leave at about 8:30PM on Sunday night, in walked a man and his wife with a bag full of the most interesting mushrooms I've ever seen.  Chef Charleen, the staff and the kitchen crew all gathered around as he poured out the thick, chunky, colorful mushrooms that he hoped to sell.  The casual, open atmosphere of the restaurant made it comfortable for me to grab my camera and join the little group gathered around the earthy fungi and snap a few shots.  The Chef bought the whole bag by the way.  I wish I were around the following few days to see how she ended up using them.  We loved the fresh, new foods we got to try and loved meeting the entire group of folks who make this restaurant a top choice.  No wonder they've won so many awards.",

The lunch menu had maybe 6 thing so my friend picked the veg, salad, and sandwich.  Sounds basic enough...  I was over the moon about the margarita which i had really been craving that day.  Since they only have 2 cocktails listed on the lunch menu I was grateful for the \"simple\" margarita with lime and agave.  My friend got the other option-a bubbly drink with aperol.  We were both happy with our drinks... Straightforward and not shy on punch.  The salad came out first which was greenery with fresh tomatoes, figs, and blue cheese.  This salad tasted earthy and farm-y with the subtle figs forcing us to discuss how fig jam is too overkill sweet.  How do these subtle fruits transform sweeter than honey?  Turns out the veg is a zucchini with roasted tomato and black tahini.  Really amazing flavors that enhance the dark roasted tomato and crisp zucchini. My friend loved it but I didn't love it... The tahini reminds me if mud or dirt especially next to such fresh produce.  The sandwich was really delicious with a million genius things I don't even want to go into detail.  Sort of a lavosh wrap served open faced with crispy eggplant, hard boiled egg, Harissa... Really generously enjoyable and surprising with each bite.",

That was one of the most decadent and gigantic thing (twss) I have ever tasted...almost.  I tried the Butterscotch Pudding, so creamy and custardy.  A little too sweet for my taste buds, but very good besides. The smooth and not overly acidic coffee hit the spot.    I also looked over the main menu.  Definitely a must try for next time.

Wow-it was top notch.  What I loved about FnB, aside from the excellent food, was the fine dining service with a relaxed, yet classy, atmosphere (they reset your silverware as you move through courses).  We found out that our server was actually the owner!  I was beyond impressed.    My best friend and I went to FnB for dessert in November of 2014.  We ordered the butterscotch pudding (they are known for it) and a pear cake with a locally-made vanilla ice cream.  The pudding was really good, but the pear cake, perfectly seasoned with nutmeg, was to die for!  We almost ordered a second.  I will continue to bring family and friends to this restaurant.",

My search brought me to FnB and using yelp I was liking the reviews as the majority are 4 and 5 stars.  I rate it 3.5  Here's the deal. Everything was fine.  Service was good, atmosphere was good and the food was good but nothing was outstanding and nothing wowed us.  One thing that kind of bothered me was being oversold by the server.  I'm a big eater but the amount of food we were led to order was too much.    2 starters 2 veggies 1 entree.  1 veg would've been more than enough.    We ate a few bites out of both and took one home and left the other.  The food flew out of the kitchen and IMO the pacing was too fast.   We ordered a bottle of wine and I felt like we had to chug it at the end.  Two dishes we enjoyed were the asparagus, polenta and fried egg.  The other was the cauliflower with fish sauce.  They had a good flavor balance and a little pop to separate a one toned meal.  The chicken they're known for was delicious but for the price point at the end of the day it's still a chicken.  What didn't work... The rutabaga dish.  It was literally a baked/ steamed rutabaga with a shit ton of creme fresh.    Overall solid food but if you're looking to be wowed with depths of flavor this may not be the place.",

    "text": "Short review:   Dishes that encourage sharing; small bites with big flavor. Creative food made with love. Decently priced for lunch but can get expensive for dinner - but you can get great drinks at either time!  Long review:  This place actually gave a very bad first impression when we first stopped by for lunch - it was closed during its posted opened business hours online, with a sign that says they will be open for dinner. So reluctantly we came back another day for lunch, and we are so glad we did!  The lunch menu is very simple compared to the dinner menu, but the food is wonderful. It's been a while since we've eaten here, but I'll do my best to remember:  A chive dip with chips: light, creamy, and opens the palate for more. Delicious; but still, relatively simple. 4/5  Squash pastry: this thing impressed me a lot, since it got us to eat the vegetables on the table without seeming like we were eating vegetables. It was pretty great. Hubby did not enjoy it as much as I did. 3.9/5  Summer salad: I loved this salad. I don't remember quite what was in it, but it had greens, pomegranates, and strawberries. Yum. 4.5/5  Pork Belly: OMG, this thing is so delicious. Originally it was meatball of some kind on the menu, but they subbed this out because they ran out of it in the back and I'm glad they did! It came in a broth that was packed with flavor! This is the dish that made me love this place and we didn't even order it! 5/5  Chicken Greek wrap: It's ok. We were really full by then, but it was basically a well-made chicken wrap. 3.5/5  Dessert: I don't recall what it was called, but it was caramel on the bottom and cream on the top, and I could lick this thing clean. 4.5/5  We went back for dinner, and we had some very delicious food; but some not so impressive dishes as well.  Fried chickpeas: about the only thing neither my husband nor I cared for here. It really did not have much flavor, but it came out greasy anyway. 1/5  Heirloom tomato salad: YUM. Big flavors, wonderful comeback. Fresh and vibrant, with the tomatoes speaking up on their own. 4.5/5  Pasta: this was really good here. Noodles were straw like and came in a marinara sauce, topped with cheese - it gave us a feeling of a wonderful home cooked meal from Italy. 4.5/5  Lamb: Not my favorite. It was a very greasy dish; grilled lamb chops over eggplant. I couldn't eat too much of this, but it did have great flavor. 3/5  Overall, impressive. A must try for people who like food. I would advise going at lunch; even with the smaller menu, it was delicious.",

We arrived with a group of 8 people, 30 minutes before closing. They were beyond accommodating. The owner was very friendly and the waitstaff just as nice. They allowed us to eat on the outside tables and the service was still superb. The old fashioned and cranberry presbyterian were the best mixed drinks I've had in awhile. Upon explanation of the menu, we ordered a ton. Each dish sounded and tasted better than the last. The rigatoni with duck confit was to die for. The turnips had great flavors and were cooked to perfection. The leak dish with the egg and bread crumbs was mouth watering. There was nothing we didn't like at this place. What a treat to eat here! I would make it a point to come eat here if I am ever in the area or if I know people who will be traveling in the area, I will definitely recommend a meal here. The owner is very modest but there dishes deserve all the praise in the world. Truly an excellent meal and a fantastic dinning experience.",

My favorites were the carrots, broccoli, and rutabagas - creatively prepared and hearty enough to be meals in their own right. Their standing butterscotch pudding is worth it - get it even if you're full. We also ordered their cheapest Arizona red wine, and it was great! The owner was warm and welcoming, and all of the servers were really friendly and helpful. There was no snootiness here, but real enthusiasm for great food and people who come to enjoy it.",

I'm typically a steak/potato type guy, but  place is really great. I don't know what half the ingredients are in a entree, but they all taste great. Every thing we had was prepared well, tasty, and a good sized portion.  The staff is very attentive, and the place has a great vibe. We don't get down to old town much, but will make this the place for dinner when we do.  We prefer the chefs table (Bar) over a table, seems way more fun and hip.",

    "text": "My wife and I visit family in Scottsdale several times a year and always enjoy checking out the latest new restaurants.  In short: FnB is the best meal we have had so far this year, and perhaps in all our years o f visiting Scottsdale. If you live in the area and enjoy good food, you must check this out.    We were there wtih another couple and having four of us enabled us to taste a wider variety of dishes.  *Every* single dish was excellent!  We had a selection of appetizers: Spigarello, shaved fennel / citrus salad, braised leeks with mozarella, romanescu all of which were tremendous.  Nicely prepared, delicate flavors, beautifully presented.  Our main courses were also wonderful: roasted jidori chicken, trout, flat iron steak. Portions were good, not over the top, and a good value.  The steak was perfectly cooked medium / rare, the chicken was crispy as promised, the trout was the best my brother ever had.  We had a nice Arizona red wine (who knew?) recommended by Pavle the owner who was our server.  Deserts were inspired and a perfect finish to the meal.  We shared chocolate sourdough bread pudding with cherries and apple gingerbread clafoutis that my wife loved.  Pavle also brought a taste of the butterscotch pudding which sounded ordinary but was phenomenal with the coffee.    If I sound impressed with the food, I was.  Everyone loved the dinner.  It was absolutely one of the best meals I have had *ever*.  Service was attentive and thoughtful without being overbearing.  Ambiance and decor was good.  Music not too loud, so you could have a conversation without having to strain.    FnB has been in operations only for a couple of months, but this is destined to be one of Scottsdales best restaurants.  It's not a big place, so I recommend making reservations as it will only get more popular over time.  Best of all, the prices are quite reasonable and the staff is there to make *you* comfortable.  If you want something prepared a bit different they'll do their best to take care of you.    Let them know you saw this review on Yelp and maybe you'll get a little taste of something extra also!  I wish there were more restaurants with this quality of food and service. --Zack",

We were seated promptly upon arrival and greeted by the wonderful, and personable owner Pavle. The atmosphere was very \"chill\". Although FnB is a smaller restaurant it does not seem crowded as our rather large party was seated comfortably and not bumped into by waiters or other patrons. The bright tile floors compliment a nice mood lighting to emphasize energy in a more mellow environment. One of the more enjoyable touches was the classic yet deeper jazz tracks completing the perfect atmosphere.     A fine beverage list of cocktails, Arizonan wine, and local brew is available as well as some of the most delicious appetizers one could find. Pavle suggested a family recipe of fresh mozzarella, leeks, a fried egg, and bread crumbs for starters, at first I was a little apprehensive of the offerings I put my trust in Pavle's expertise and was not disappointed in the slightest. The entree of Spinach pasta with fava beans was superb. And meyer lemon poundcake with ice cream and a raspberry sauce for desert completed one the most delicious meals I had ate in a long time. Pavle and FnB delivered and I would have to put this on the top of my list for dining locations in Scottsdale.",

For example, the mouth-watering falafel with crispy kale on the outside, while the core of the falafel is cooked to perfection- not dry but melting. I have had a lot of falafels in my life, never this good. This supreme experience continued with the chicken and the swordfish entrees and a side order of brussels sprouts in curry sauce! We stumbled on this gem after we couldn't get into a couple of your run-of-the-mill crowded and very noisy restaurants. Pavle, the effervescent and very friendly co-owner was kind enough to give us the last table in the house. Guess where I'll be dining every time I visit PHX!",

Pavle and Charleen are the dynamic duo of Old Town. I've been in for dinner several times and can't keep away during late night on the weekends. I look forward to the twitter update every week that lets you in on the menu. It doesn't take long to round up 4-5 people as ready for dinner as I. If you go with 2-3 people sitting at the open bar around the kitchen is really the way to go.   Make a reservation for dinner and let the staff help guide you through the ever changing menu, which includes lot of locally grown produce. The wine list is a True showcase of the wines Arizona has to offer. If you are new to Arizona wineries let the staff guide you there as well, and I promise you will be pleasantly surprised.   I had a macaroni and cheese this past Friday I could live off forever. I don't love lamb generally - but I loved theirs. Save room for dessert, because at FnB it is always worth the extra two miles on the treadmill.",

Most places want to turn the table, but this place wanted to ensure we enjoyed ourselves.   As for the food, there was nothing left on the plates. The food was so good, i think the entire party was tempted to lick the plates. The corn was very tasty and the Pate stole the show! I had always been on the fence with pate, but this place left me craving more. The lamb was great and the salads and pasta had such great flavor. All the food danced on my palette. And to finish the night off we ended with the Butterscotch Pudding. They say it has a following, and I proud to join that following. The texture and flavor was mind blowing. My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   I will definitely be going back to FnB!",

The mussels had a different preparation than I had ever tried before. The pasta was probably my favorite dish.

After spending $160 on a meal and a bottle of wine, we were enjoying the end of our meal, when the hostess told us we would have to leave soon because someone else needed our table.  Being understanding, we asked if we could sit at the bar to finish our $50 bottle of wine, and the hostess told us 'no, that is reserved'.  The bar had been half empty since the time we had started dinner.  We left confused; having enjoyed the food but been treated terribly by her.

Due to the use of local ingredients, and a unique concept we decided to try it out.    We started with a few cocktails and some fried oysters.  The fried oysters were different that some I've had before.  They were super crisy on the outside, but raw and fresh on the inside.  I prefer my oysters still in the shell, but my gf loved them.    For the meal I had a pasta (made in-house) dish with heirloom tomatoes and mozzarella.  The gf had the chicken dish with polenta.  Both were fantastic.  The portions were large too, so we had some to take home.  For desert we had a buttercake which was almost like a big cupcake with vanilla ice cream and fresh peaches.  It too was awesome.  This places rating is for real.  Our server was very knowledgeable and explained the menu to us well.  The food was fresh and delicious.  I love the local vibe to the items and the creativity of the menu.  Everything about this place was great.    The place is fairly small so I recommend a reservation.

It had dishes using preserved lemon (Moroccan) and the langos, a puff pastry appetizer with roasted garlic and goat cheese, is originally Hungarian (not Turkish, as another reviewer wrote, and the name has an N in it). Traditionally, langos are supposed to be soft and elastic, more like a bread, not like a big potato chip, but maybe that's FnB's unique version?  Another appetizer, preserved duck eggs, was delicious. The menu includes lots of veggie dishes using local produce -- very well flavored and cooked. This would be a good restaurant for vegans or vegetarians.  The wine list was overpriced for mediocre wines -- mostly Az local.   The ginger cake dessert was a real piece de resistance. Truly astronomical.  The prices were astronomical too. The bill for four of us, each ordering one appetizer and one main course, we shared a single dessert and one bottle of $38 wine came to $300!",

    "text": "We came here for dinner on Friday night and I absolutely loved the charm of this place. Its a tiny little restaurant that packs a lot of punch. We were seated at the bar, which happens to surround the kitchen which is in the middle of the restaurant. It was awesome, we could watch the 3 chef's work silently while preparing everyone's food. Pavle, the owner took great care of us all evening and he was so fun to chat and laugh with! He recommend a great bottle of wine and decanted it for us in one of his MANY awesome decanters. It was a nice touch.   We started off the meal with the cheese plate and it was good. The nut bread was fresh off the grill and the cheese paired perfectly with the apples, almonds and spicy apricot spread. For the salad we ordered the molina lettuces. This lettuce is hand picked for them daily and you can really taste the freshness of the greens. They were crispy and spicy and the mayo blue cheese was so good on top with the explosion of pomegranate seeds. It was sooo fresh and sooo delicious. I loved the salad. For our mains, I had the Cod and my boyfriend had the pasta and both were equally delicious. Mine was a little salty, but all in all the fish was cooked perfectly. It was a perfectly executed meal. We debated on dessert and had the chocolate steam cake and I wasnt overly impressed with it. The peanut crunch on top was better than the cake I thought.   We were the last ones in the restaurant and Pavle entertained us the entire night! He suggested restaurants for my boyfriend to check out while in town this week. He was great! I would definitely recommend checking this place out! The service was TOP notch, the food was stellar and the charm of this place will put a smile on your face!!",

    "text": "I happened upon this restaurant by accident, as out-of-town relatives invited me to dine with them when they had a cancellation in their group.  I'm glad they did.  I'm not a foodie, not even a fake one, and can't testify to tasting seventeen different aspects of each course, but I can tell you that the Lamb Tenderloin I had with a side order of with Swiss Chard was fantastic.  The citrus-marinated olives are a treat as well.  This is not my traditional dining experience; it's a bit above what I tend to favor.  However, I know when food tastes good, and I know when it tastes fresh, and FnB provides both in spades.  With drinks (several Vox Rocks, Extra Dirty), I spent about twice what I normally do for dinner ($80 with tip), but you'll not hear me complain, as it was fantastic from start to finish.  I won't be here every week, but I can say it will be someplace at the top of my list in terms of occasion dining.",

SERVICE was mediocre; I went by myself, I asked to sit at the bar; the receptionist did not inform me that a bar seat had opened up; I had to seat myself.   FOOD really, really kicked butt.  I ordered the only fish on the menu.  Note: dishes change every season, so reviews read here may be applicable for upcoming seasons.  The fish was cooked perfectly and complemented by an assortment of fresh ingredients: veggies and fruit.   I have never used the word \"complex\" until I tried this dish because there was no other way to describe how each bite brings out new combinations of flavor. Will absolutely consider going back.",

    "text": "FnB represents everything that is good and right in the restaurant scene currently in Phoenix.  Every component that makes a restaurant great is to be had in spades at this little gastro-center.   The Food: Charleen's creative, local-focused, uber fresh cuisine features a short menu that is anything but on flavor.  Every single flavor combination featured is spot on. The Jidori chicken is hands down the best I've every had, with spaetzle and wildflowers. The chicken is moist, flavorful, and pairs perfectly with the texture and simplicity of the spaetzle. Every single appetizer and entree wows in its own unique way, the only thing longed for is more options once you've eaten everything on the menu. To me, the menu is the perfect balance of simplicity, creativity, flavor, and little bits of heaven.  The Wine: All Arizona? Yes. Bad thing? Not at all. With characters like Pavle, Josh, and Emily helping you choose wines that you will enjoy, it's hard to go wrong.  My advice, take their advice- they know what they're talking about and very likely are going to know what works well with which food items.   The Service: Perfect. Pavle could make anyone feel welcome and comfortable, and the entire staff has more serving experience than most restaurants in the valley combined. Trust them when they recommend things, believe them when say they know.    The Ambiance: This is the only restaurant in the valley that makes me feel at home, and the only place I'll go if I need to feel like I am.",

    "text": "This place IS as good as it gets.  I travel a lot for work and try to eat at the best places in whatever city I am.  Fnb is a gem and a foodie heaven.    I was lucky enough to dine at the counter with no reservation early on a Tuesday night.  I had no idea that they fill up so fast after 7 on a weekday.  Upon sitting at the counter, I was warmly greeted and given a run down on the specials of the evening which included a marinated beef tongue as an appetizer and a Ribeye steak for an entree.  Being an heirloom tomato addict, I chose a salad of heirloom tomatoes, avocado, almond, and ricotta to start and the grilled lamb tenderloin with eggplant, carrots, and mint  The heirloom tomato salad was ridiculous.  The avocado and ricotta perfectly complemented the sweet and tart tomatoes which were lightly covered with a simple dressing.  I am not able to get this quality of produce at home in the midwest very easily, so I was enjoying every bite as much as I could.  It was a great and fresh start to my meal.  After sipping a great wine recommended by the matre'd, I received my entree of medium rare marinated lamb with grilled eggplant and carrots.  First off, I have cooked and tried many lamb dishes from around the world and this lamb was THE best lamb I have ever put in my mouth.  Perfectly cooked and seasoned.  There was a faint hint of garlic to the meat, but not over powering.  A Truely superb dish.  The eggplant and carrots just added to the pleasure.  Both were wonderfully cooked and positioned with the sliced lamb for a great presentation.  I unfortunately did not get a chance to try dessert due to my incredibly fully stomach, but upon my next visit, I will probably not eat for 2 days so I can have 3 courses.    This place is an incredible spot and you can definitely see that the executive chef loves their job and the food they cook.  5 STARS!",

    "text": "Very disappointing meal.  The meal started off fine, enjoying the beet salad but it was all downhill from there.  My ribeye, which I ordered medium rare came out medium well and had to be sent back.  Alter waiting 5-8 minutes while everyone else at the table ate their dinner, the second steak, although prepared properly, was tough and full of grizzle and fat.  The steaks at Costco are better.  I ordered a cup of tea, which is served in individual sized pots, and after waiting a few minues for the tea to steep I poured the tea into my cup only to realize that it was just hot water.  The tea leaves which sit in a strainer at the top of the pot was not submerged into the water.  I had to ask for another pot.  Management never apologized for these errors, did not offer to comp a desert, nothing.    The prices are high, $15 for a glass of wine, $29 for entry, sevice spotty and food mixed.  There are only four entries on the menu so you would think they would be able to get them right.",

    "text": "I'd been wanting to try this restaurant for the longest time - then out of no where, the bf decided to grow a romatical bone and took me here for dinner one Sunday night. The place is tiny - but it's packed full of good food and good people. We sat at the bar, which is awesome because we got to watch the chefs do their magic. I can't remember what we started off with. But we split the Chicken Jidori and spicy broccoli. The broccoli was delicious, it had pistachios on it that I kept picking off with my fingers. I couldn't help myself! The chicken was juicy and served with spaetzel. I'd never had it but I could definitely hear my boyfriend moaning over how good everything tasted.  Little did we know that on Sunday nights, they do a late night special - this particular evening it was fried crawfish with a thai fish sauce served over rice. AMAZING. It was a heaping amount of Crawfish, for less than $15. I thought we would only get 6 or so. And there was a giant mound. This place was great. The server was a gem, the chefs hook it up with great food and I'm sure I'll be back on a Sunday for the Late Night Special. Apparently, if you follow them on FB, you'll get updates on what they're serving up for the special.   Next on my list from these great people is Baratin - they just opened up a little wine bar cafe and I'm sure the food is going to be just as amazing.",

    "text": "Dearest FnB,  I realize we have just met and I am putting a lot of weight on our first evening together...but I love you.  I have been infatuated before and I know this is so much more than that.  Last night, even as I sat staring into your local produce, the sweetness of your grilled butternut squash still upon my lips, this poem was forming in my mind.  I know it is not original but a take off from the great Elizabeth Barrett Browning of the Romantic Movement.  To me it feels right and fitting that a great sonnet taken from among the best the world has to offer is an appropriate way to enumerate your intoxicating virtues:  FnB, how do I love thee? Let me count the ways. I love thee to the depth and breadth and height of your menu My palate can reach, when tasting out of sight For the local produce being prepared in grace. I love thee to the level of every day's meal  Ok, that's enough romance.  When can I get with you again, FnB?  I must have you from the top of your delicate appetizers all the way through to your sweet and tender desserts.  You plied me with your cranberry infused vodka and zest of lemon, your spiced roasted nuts bursting with flavor again and again.  Your crispy rock shrimp, flash-fried to tender perfection in their light and revealing cornmeal covering are etched upon my mind.  And the jalapeno tartar...you can be a spicy vixen indeed!  Your lovely salad of apple, celery root, walnuts and blue cheese was sublime in it's awakening flavors brought on by the simple vinegary coating, awakening in me the abiding desire to plough through your menu and consume you to your core.  Yes, from there it rolled inexorably on to grilled butternut squash with pear and bacon, each bright flavor building on the next.  The fried green tomatoes were a revelation to us both (yes you had us both, you saucy wench) with their tart and delicate interiors exploding through the complimenting dressing and feta cheese with which you plied them.  Oh yes!  And your flatiron steak...I don't often play with the red meat team but your presentation, your flavor...purple and cheddar cauliflower, caper and golden raisin salsa verde...enough I say, you overwhelm me with your generosity, you just give and give until...  And your desserts!  I tremble at the thought of your chocolate bread pudding, macerated cherries all over with nary a care of what others may think!  Outstanding!  As if all of this were not enough your service throughout the meal was warm and comforting.  To a member, I felt your staff was there to please me and me alone.  But, Fnb, as in all healthy relationships, open and honest communication is tantamount to a wonderful and enduring relationship.  With that understanding I have the following constructive criticism.  I had to look deep within to find even the hint of a fault...your fried green tomatoes.  When my mother used to make them they were sliced more thinly and fried in a skillet...this made them delightfully crunchy on the outside.  Oh my God, have I compared you to my mother?!  Freud be damned! Just forget that, and forgive me FnB.  I'll be back soon.  In heartfelt adoration,  Jim W",

This means that there are seasonal changes to the menu but that only gives you a reason to go back.  I like to order dishes when I go out that I've never had before.  You'll find a number of odd sounding dishes here but don't be afraid to be adventurous. Who knew that I'd like braised leeks with mozzarella and a fried egg? But I do.  I doubt that you'd be disappointed in any of the appetizers but in addition to the leeks, try the pork and duck pate.  At one time or another I think I've tried all of the main courses - pick whatever tickles your fancy - I don't think you can go wrong.  Save room for dessert. A personal favorite is the butterscotch pudding.  You'll also find an interesting wine list here - I believe they are all from Arizona wineries - Who knew?  They're surprisingly good.  One tip - This is a popular place so you should make a reservation.",

I had been wanting to try this restaurant for years! The restaurant is very cute...small and kind of looks like an old diner (ish). They got the third star because they brought out a bit of champagne for us, on the house, because it was my birthday....nice touch. Our waiter started out strong, being friendly and helpful. We decided to share:  A special - lamb ribs that were braised for 8 hours and then fried over couscous, the cheese plate, the jidori chicken, and the spicy broccoli.  The lamb had good flavor, but there were only two really good ribs and the rest were very greasy and fatty... not awesome. The couscous it came with was good, but nothing too exciting. The sauce was pretty good, almost a bit minty or something.   The cheese plate was a huge disappointment for me. The waiter described the cheese as a ooey gooey cheese that was really bad for you, but very rich....it was gooey, but it had a very odd flavor...it was not a cheese I particularly cared for. Additionally, it came with toast (burnt), dried figs (flavorless), nuts (weirdly seasoned), apples (good), and dried cranberries and orange jam like stuff (both pretty good). I feel like a 12$ cheese plate should come with more than one cheese. Maybe that's just me.   The chicken had a really tasty, almost hash like, spaetzle under it that I really enjoyed. The chicken itself was good, but it came with maybe half of a chicken breast and then the leg and thigh. The BF and I are not huge dark meat fans and this dark meat was particularly gamey. The white meat was good, but there wasn't enough of it. This was, in my opinion, the most flavorful dish we had.   My biggest disappointment was the broccoli. Everyone on Yelp and our waiter said that the chef was a master at cooking vegetables and our waiter recommended the broccoli. I do not get it. I like broccoli, but this just tasted like plain broccoli, it was not spicy AND it was served over a giant pool of mayo....the bf and I both don't like mayo (and the BF is allergic to eggs), so we really couldn't enjoy this dish. It does not mention the mayo in the dish description.   Towards the end of our meal our waiter seemed to disappear, a large table was seated and we ceased to have any attention. I do not understand what the fuss is about...we paid almost 70$ for this meal, and it was just mediocre at best....the food was very salty (gave me a headache) and I would prefer to eat at so many other restaurants in Phoenix. I didn't even order dessert on my birthday because I didn't want to spend the money when everything else was so blah. I wouldn't spend my money here again when there are so many deserving (and more fairly priced) places to eat.",

We ordered the Lamb Empanadas, the Spicy pasta salad with zucchini and the summer squash and sausage dishes for us to share together. All of them were extremely good.

The appetizer salad we had was a combination of  watermelon, cucumbers, pine nuts, corn nuts, feta, cilantro, with a very light vinagrette. It sounded bizarre, but it totally worked.  The lamb manti, though, was transcending. All I can say is that it's over the moon fantastic. We all loved it. Imagine small little lamb packets topped with a light cream, and sprinkled with pomegranate seeds. Amazing.   I had the pasta with heirloom tomatoes, and wow, the pasta was done right. The tomatoes were also divine, super sweet, and full of flavor. Amazing olive oil as well, I could have had a few more bites of just the oil and bread. Or twenty.  My husband had the hailbut, and it was perfection. Perfectly well cooked without being dry. The only thing I would have liked more was....more.  The wait staff was top notch, highly professional and very courteous. This is always a test for me. I loved each of their manners.  Can't wait to go back to this wonderful gastro pub!",

    "text": "We had dinner plans with friends on the calendar for over a month... When we made the plans, we said we'd figure out the time and place as the date approached.  So when my friend suggested we go to FnB, I hesitated for a moment...  \"What is FnB,\" I asked? (Embarrassed that I had no clue).  \"It's the new restaurant located where Sea Saw and Digestif used to be,\" my friend informed me.  \"OK - Perfect,\" I responded - still having no clue what to expect.  Jared and I were fans of Digestif and ironically, we happened to be there on the last night they were open.  We went in for dinner on Sunday, October 18th (the day after our wedding) and were shocked to hear the news... But enough about that!  In just six weeks time, this restaurant transformed into FnB, the creation of Pavle Milic and Chef Charleen Badman.  It now has a bit more space and a warmer, lighter feeling to it... the tile on the floor is really unique and colorful.  You can tell it's a family-run business too... we felt extremely welcome from the moment we set foot inside and we met the entire staff, Emily, Josh, Pavle, Chef Charleen, and Sous Chef Sasha.  But enough about the atmosphere and the fantastic staff, I'm sure you want to know about the food!  The menu is limited, but pretty much everything on it is appealing.  Luckily, our table was up for sharing.  We started with two orders of the crispy rock shrimp & jalapeno tartar and a fried green tomato salad.  Both were delicious... I especially enjoyed the combination of the fried green tomatoes with green goddess dressing and feta.    We continued with the citrus marinated olives as an appetizer to share... they aren't kidding with the \"citrus\" description - you can really taste it and I loved it!  Jared and I shared the boneless trout entree and our companions shared the roast jidori chicken entree and we all shared an order of the spigarello.  What's spigarello? It's similar to broccoli rabe but not quite as bitter.  Chef Charleen prepares it with garlic and chili and it's delicious!  Needless to say, we cleaned all of our plates!  As if that wasn't enough, we proceeded to order one of each of the dessert offerings: a lemon creme brulee, an apple crisp, and the cherry chocolate bread pudding that Angela mentioned in her review.  The lemon brulee and the bread pudding were the favorites at our table.  And from listening to Pavle talk about it, I think the chocolate bread pudding is his favorite too!  Oh, and I forgot to mention that I was the only drinker in our group last night... I had a glass of sauvignon blanc - one from Chile - and it was perfect.  The prices aren't bad considering everything used at this restaurant is bought fresh daily from local farms.  We'll be back to see our friends at FnB again soon... and I encourage you to go check out this little gem of a restaurant as well!  Just make sure to save us a seat at the bar.",

My daughter and my mother as well are floored by every meal we have experienced there.  It is truly a joy to eat there. Pavle is also a wonderful host and all the servers we have come in contact with there are wonderful as well. Maryanne in the bodega too can give you tips to all the best items.  What a joy!",

We decided to order only one entree and several starters and sides which turned out to be a nice way to try more items on the menu. Our favorites were the braised leeks and rutabaga with creme fraiche. Also ordered dessert which was incredible.

Something about sitting up and being able to watch these amazing chefs create wonders is highly missed for me. With that said, now I can get on to all the kick ass stuff these guys are doing! FOOD GLORIOUS FOOD. With the Farm to Table concept in full gear here, this place is heaven for your sinning taste buds. The menu is constantly changing so you will be pleasantly surprised every time you visit.   Chef Charleen brings it from the start to the finish. Let's start with the appetizers, order one or two of them. You'll need to wake that mouth up from your day to day grub. Entrees, um pretty much pick your favorite protein and wait to have mouth and gut karate chopped by the Chef. This place put's so much flavor into their dishes that you savor every little chew. Your mouth is almost exhausted from the additional chewing you'll do here.   Check out FnB's special events as well. We did the Chinese \"Pop Up\" event and had an absolutely amazing meal from Chef Helen Yung from Sweet Republic. That girl can bring it when it comes to pre dessert food!  Doesn't FnB stand for \"F***iNg Brilliant\"?!?",

Terrific service. (Slightly pricey wine.)   We were visiting Scottsdale for a day-long business meeting and then took a couple days afterwards to enjoy the desert sun before going back to gray cold Chicago. We had been walking around Old Town, so really didn't know where to go and FnB popped up. We didn't have a reservation, and the host was very very kind to let us grab a table in the time window before another party showed up. THANK YOU. And once we were seated, no rush at all for us to finish and move on. Such a delight.   So grateful because this is truly one of the best. Just a panoply of flavors and textures in one dish. One delight after another. Will definitely be back when I'm back in Scottsdale.",

The shrimp were light and fluffy and the leek dish was phenomenal as other reviewers have mentioned.  We ordered a nice bottle of Arizona Stronghold red wine to go with our lamb and chicken entrees.

Have I been living a lie my entire life? The menu itself is spectacular. They have the perfect amount of items on the menu for you to choose from. My husband and I looked at each other and we wanted to order the whole entire menu...haha. The waiter suggested that we order about 4 dishes to share and that their portion were generous, but we aren't average people so we ordered 7...lol (We should've listened to the waiter...they weren't kidding about being generous.)   Chicken gizzards. If your afraid on innards, don't be because if you didn't tell us we would have thought it was popcorn chicken. Crispy and super tender and juicy on the inside. Not your average innard. The sauce was delicious and the beautiful flowers added a nice fresh peppery last to the dish.  Waxed bean aged cheddar and black bread. This was the first time I had waxed beans and it was pretty good. Crispy refreshing picked bites with savory cheddar and sweet bread. You know you nailed it when you think things just shouldn't go together, but realize that they do work together.  Strawberry, rhubarb salad with glacier lettuce. This was one of my favorite dishes. The glacier lettuce was crisp fresh and lightly pickled and all the elements that I like were in the dish. Strawberries and goat cheese, who could say no?  Mexican shrimp was another one our favorites. It a little hard describe but what looks like a ceviche is nothing close. It's a must try flavor explosion. The flavors had many layers and depth to the dish and to just call it a ceviche is like a insult. All the flavors or savory, sweet, spicy, acidic and richness played a beautiful symphony on your palate.  Socca and Squash was yummy too.   Rutabaga was really good as well, but since we didn't listen to the waiter... 5 dishes in the rutabaga was really filling. Out of everything, this was my least favorite but it was still really good.  We were at our stomach limits, but no matter what we HAD to get dessert. We were on the edge about two dessert and they recommend the grapefruit dessert. OMG it was so zingy but so good. Tasty creme sandwiched between beautiful crispy flaky layers.  We came back 2 days later because we wanted to try the complete menu. Unfortunately, to our surprise they changed the menu and we were not about to order 7 dishes this time around. We ended up ordering more mediterranean style dished this time around. The dolmas were great and huge. We made the mistake of order two chickpeas style dishes, which both were really good but in the end it was a bit too much chick pea overall. Coconut dessert was a pleasant ending to our meal.  Overall, everything was delightful and service was so friendly. We loved how every single element contributed to the dishes and elevated even more. Each dish seasoned to perfection and put together with so much creativity and thought. This will be my go to spot when I'm in Arizona, but for now I'll be on the look out for something in Cali to satisfy my veggie cravings.",

Obscure ingredients that sound interesting on the menu but contrast the underlying flavor of the ingredients. The service is ridiculously haute.

The falafel and asparagus dishes were fantastic, the flavors were interesting and rich. The other two dishes were terrible. The broccoli was basically just burnt, it had yogurt type sauce and grapefruit slices as well. It didn't have a lot of flavor. The pasta dish was weird, I kind of liked the sauce, but it didn't match with the pasta or something. It was unfulfilling.

Starters- watermelon and shrimp salad: Tasty, refreshing, well seasoned  Heirloom tomatoes: very fresh, under-salted, nice presentation  Side- zucchini with squash: bland but the zucchini was cooked nicely. Would not order again Main- Pork Chop: fantastic! Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Delicious salad below of corn, peaches, almonds, very tasty.  Overall, would definitely come back for the pork entree.",

    "text": "How does this place have so many good reviews?   It took 45 minutes for pasta, with no meat, just some heirloom tomatoes, mozzarella and a 'sauce'. There was no flavor to the food at all. We were so let down, the food tasted like it came out of a barilla box.   The hostess told us that there would be a free dessert or champagne in celebration of our anniversary, which didn't happen.   Potatoes and zucchini were fine, but certainly below our expectations, given all the hype and accolade.   Add 2 cocktails and our bill was north of $90.   We literally walked across the street to get dessert and save ourselves having to wait for an inattentive staff to bring out ice cream from Sweet Republic, and berries. K. Thanks.",

    "text": "I was to told this place is crazy amazing. Like most farm to table and seasonal menus you expect the flavors of the food to meld together and the menu items to be complimentary of each other. This is not the case. Nothing goes together. The food is just ok and not worth the money. We started off with the ricotta cheese and egg plant dish which was terrible. Texture and taste wrong wrong wrong. Then we had the fried chicken liver which was probably the best thing we ordered but again it was just ok. Next they brought out the corn, sea bass, and mozzarella bacon pasta. I love sea bass and I had one bite and couldnt get myself to eat anymore. My daughter however loved i but husband didnt care for it.  The corn was alright and pasta just ok. The reason I am giving this place 3 stars is not for the food ( because the food is 2 star max) it's for the service and ambiance of the restaurant. They played classic jazz which is great and the lighting and set up of the restaurant is comfortable and inviting. Again it was the 2019 summer seasonal menu maybe they just got it all wrong this season.",

A varied changing menu is always a sign for me of a talented creative kitchen. We commented many times during the meal how we appreciated the talent in the kitchen! I don't know if commenting on the specific dishes is relevant because the likelihood of them being on the menu in the future is low but the Takeaway of this review simply is that you can't go wrong here, and if you want fresh delicious creative food this is your spot. Also our waiter and service throughout the evening was outstanding! Actual rating is 4.5 stars",

I liked the setup of the place - the different dining rooms helped to give a more private feel and keep the noise levels lower.   The food was fantastic. The hardcore carnivores and picky vegan/vegetarians all found multiple dishes that they enjoyed and wanted to come back for. We ordered family style so that we could try pretty much the entire menu. My favorites were the grilled peaches and corn, halibut entree, and the vegan eggplant tart.   While we did not venture into the extensive wine menu, we did have cocktails (they had four options on the menu). My negronis were strong and expertly made, a perfect pairing to the different dishes we ordered. I would definitely come back again.",

The food however really did not live up to what had read about it. The leek dish was good, but not great. The mozzarella was not a good choice of cheese on it. It seemed clumsy on a dish with such potential. We then had the scallops which were okay. They were lacking in overall flavor, though the scallops themselves were cooked perfectly. The pasta dish was a disaster. Our waiter made a big deal about the pasta being imported from Italy but it was poorly executed. It was like chewing on a gum ball. The crab in the dish seemed frozen and did not have a good flavor or consistency. The sauce on the pasta was soupy. We mentioned our disappointment of the dish to the waiter. He was gracious and took the dish off the bill which we did not expect or want.   So to recap, service great, food not so much.",

    "text": "4 stars for Scottsdale, maybe 3.5 for LA.    Another key comment, this is not a Gastropub.  Not sure who initially qualified this restaurant as such, but my definition of a Gastropub is a location which serves gourmet-ish, comfort, casual, beer-friendly food with an extensive selection of craft beers and select liquors in a Euro-type setting..  This beer list is comprised of 3-4 beers and not sure any of them are on tap.  Also, there is really nothing \"pub\" about the layout of this restaurant.   The central kitchen design won me over with the open-flame grill surrounded by bar seating in full view and participation of the women-only chefs creating fresh, simple yet uber-flavorful, seasonal dishes.    We walked in around 9ish on a Saturday night to have our pick of \"counter\" seating.  The kitchen is literally the size of a small bar area with an open flame grill, salamander and a couple of burners on the back side. I can't imagine how the chefs can operate in this space, but i suppose that prep work is the key.  The menu is small (again, small kitchen) and based mostly on small plates and about 3-4 main dishes.  We ordered the shishito peppers with tahini and black sesame, the beet, watermelon and feta salad, corn on the cob with parmesan and mint and the pasta and pancetta dish along with the indian-inspired halibut with yogurt, basmati rice and cucumber.  The wine list is strictly Arizona wines, which I honestly didn't even know Arizona could produce wines.    So, the low down....  I can honestly say i don't like beets.  It annoys me that i don't, and so every once in a while i try something with beets just  to make sure that I'm not missing out.  The beet-watermelon salad was delicious.  I can't say that i now love beets, but i can say that the balance between the earthiness of the beets and freshness of the watermelon and creaminess of the feta made the dish the best beet dish I've ever had.  It was also complete with some crunchy curry-garlic-herb bits that were charred in the oven.  Ok, now i'm scared since i just wrote a novel about a dish that i usually don't like. Shishito peppers.... unreal.  Tobin downed about 15 of them in 2 minutes.  They were placed on a base of tahini and sesame oil and were charred to still green perfection.  We scooped up every last pepper and wanted more.  Corn on the cob with parmesan and mint, i would have never guessed that those ingredients would work, but they did and I'm excited for Tobin to replicate at home.  And now the slight disappointment came from the main dishes.  The pasta dish was talked up by our host and it was really just another tasty pasta dish.  Pasta was cooked nicely, tomato flavor was good but i didn't taste the richness that was expected from the pancetta.  The Halibut was nice, but maybe too delicate in contrast to our starters.  Now my one complaint... I was served a nice Syrah blend at first and as i finished my first glass with the starters, was not offered another glass (while of course, Tobin was brought a nice Sangiovese blend after his  sub-par first glass of Syrah).  Instead, the server, picked up my glass and no one was at our table to check in until after we had finished our mains.  The servers and staff seemed to be very occupied with a fellow (cute girl) foodie/critic/industry insider sitting next to us, and we got an unfortunate cold shoulder.  That's what always makes me sad about service, I can usually over-order on wine and other beverages, but somehow they don't see that and lose out on additional sales.  I guess it's always a blessing for me seeing as I save a hangover the next morning and have a few extra bucks in my bank account.  Overall, i would recommend this place for anyone visiting Scottsdale and wants a quality, non-cheesy dinner atmosphere.  I would return next time i visit and hope to try more satisfying dishes and hopefully more than one glass of wine.",

Local wine, a carefully plotted menu, and a free dessert... even after we were stuffed...

    "text": "This restaurant, and I shudder a bit to call it that because what we're talking about here is a complete and total gastronomic experience, is a must if you are ever in the Scottsdale area. The food is all local, organic and sustainable when possible even down to the wine list which is replete with local selections. What they do with what they procure is just astonishing. From the moment you walk in the door, you are welcomed and made to feel at home and they are genuinely grateful that you have decided to dine there. In the center of the small room is a lovely wrap around counter where you can watch an open kitchen. The three chefs mingle in elegant dance of culinary construction that recalls Joel Robuchon's L'Atelier in Las Vegas (though considerably less expensive). The menu is sparse with 3 or 4 offerings in each category but descriptions that cause me to want to order everything. Rock Shrimp with Jalapeno tartar is a standard. When I asked my local friends if they would like to share a plate, they replied \"no, they were getting their own!\" The Jidori chicken was simply the best tasting, juicy and succulent poultry preparation I have ever had. Hands down. I did not get the butterscotch pudding for dessert and that is my one regret. I had a taste and all I can say is, \"Bradley Ogden, beware!!\" The cowboy style creme brulee, with the sugar top burned in with a branding iron was fantastic. The custard was hinted  with lavender, honey and local fruits. I wanted to chew the remaining bits of burned sugar off the ramekin with my teeth (propriety notwithstanding, I managed to behave). The server acted like he was the owner in a good way, kind, gentle, friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the wines. The owner came up to chat a few times but mostly was manning his station, ensuring quality control. The gestalt of the experience was just stunning. I will return again and again.",

They are usually quite excellent and they do great things with veggies and creams.  The only downside for us is the unnecessarily pretentious Tattoos man that waits on everyone. Every question you ask him, you will be made to feel like an idiot. He truly thinks you should just shut up and order. I believe his name was Pavle.  I'd probably give this place more stars but the entire table agreed we just weren't liking the main persons attitude so they can take our 2 stars and our $200 and suck it. Suck it hard.

    "text": "As we arrived at FnB we immediately felt right at home. There was a faint smell of toasted marshmallows in the air and the hustle and bustle of Chef Charlene Badman's small open kitchen felt like being at mom's. The warm glow of owner/manager Pavle Milic's face fortified the welcome feeling.  Short for Food and Beverage, FnB seems to have everything aligned for culinary greatness. With food and service worthy of a long-established restaurant, you'd be surprised that FnB has been open only a few months.  Located in Old Town Scottsdale, the space formerly housed the famed Sea Saw. The bar surrounds the small open kitchen, with views of Badman and Sous Chef Sacha Levine working their magic. Or, if romance is in the air, opt for a table for two. FnB is cozy and intimate.  Farm fresh, seasonal and comforting describe Badman's creative and fun menu. Even something as simple as Citrus Marinated Olives ($4) just tastes better with a touch of orange peel.  The menu is not large, with only a handful of nibbles, appetizers, sides and entrees. On one visit, our knowledgeable waiter didn't even bat an eye when we ordered just about everything on the menu.  Lightly dusted in semolina flour then flash fried, each crustacean of the Crispy Rock Shrimp and Jalapeno Tartar ($9) has a nice feathery crunch. Fried Green Tomatoes with Green Goddess Dressing and Feta ($11) combines classic components, yet brings something new and balanced to the table.  Braised Leeks, Mozzarella, Mustard Bread Crumbs and a Fried Egg ($13) are as simple as they sound, but tastier than you'd imagine. This is the beauty of Badman's cooking: farm-fresh produce prepared with love and attention.  Since it is based on seasonal bounties, the menu is always changing, so don't be surprised when your favorite dish is no longer available. During several visits I had the opportunity to try something new each time.  Try not to fall in love with the pasta offering -- on one visit the pasta was a Garganelli and other times it was Strozzapreti ($19). Both were perfect, cooked al dente and served with local veggies.  Blue Nose Bass, Snap Peas, Hazelnuts and Citrus Sauce ($21) was fresh and light, yet meaty and satisfying.  Roast Jidori Chicken ($20) sounds like a cooking preparation, so I was surprised that it's actually a breed of Japanese chicken. Smaller than your standard chicken, it's amazingly flavorful and juicy. As one of my dining mates put it, \"It tastes how chicken used to taste.\" Each succulent bite reminded me of how simple ingredients in expert hands can be so fulfilling.  Grilled Broccoli, Meyer Lemon Aioli and Crispy Onion ($6) is one of the sides. The smokiness of the slight char on the broccoli is alluring and adds an exotic dimension to something that would otherwise be ordinary.  Badman's desserts are handled with as much love and care as the rest of our experience, which made them all the sweeter. Topped with whipped cream and finished with a grating of nutmeg, each joyous spoonful of the Butterscotch Pudding ($7) brought comfort and delight.   Looking into the kitchen, I could see plumes of smoke in the air as a ramekin filled with Mint Chocolate Creme Brulee ($7) was getting seared with an iron.  It all made sense as burning sugar filled the air, like roasting marshmallows at a campfire. It's one of those things you long to come back to -- home.",

There are lots of great restaurants in Scottsdale... and all of them have better service.  Hopefully they can get their act together since their restaurant is hard to find as it is buried in the back of a small building and they probably rely a lot upon word of mouth.",

(and i left my phone in the hotel room on the charger, so i didn't take photos either that night...shame on me.)   beet salad - different colors of beets, mixed greens, wheat berry, lightly dressed in a viniagrette  asparagus with polenta cakes - i love polenta cakes. these were triangular in shape.  cauliflower dish - this one tasted like a healthy meatball marinara dish!! IT WAS THE MOST DELICIOUS CAULIFLOWER dish i've ever had.  cauliflower, marinara sauce, fennel sausage.  there was a bit of spiciness in it. Mmm...kudos to the chef!!  she's amazing.  butterscotch pudding - good balance of salty sweet flavors. butterscotch pudding topped with whipped cream and nutmeg  chocolate whiskey cake with ice cream - should've stopped at one dessert but decided to indulge since we were on vacay. enjoyed everything else, so figured...why not? =)  moist, round chocolate cake drizzled with a whiskey chocolate syrup. a scoop of vanilla ice cream complimented it well (though i thought the vanilla ice cream they used was too sweet)  they have a simple menu. there is one for lunch (no brunch), dinner, and late night. dinner is from 5-10pm. late night is after 10 (until midnight).  for the late night menu all wine is half off.

Some of us wanted to look at the menu but he took it away before we could look. Then he bought out some crap wine & even worst food. Quote \"I don't have time to make cocktails so I suggest you all have wine\", \"this is my favourite dish\". Never asked what we wanted. He insisted we only eat what he wanted to serve.

    "text": "1/30/10  Came in for dinner.  My second time at this location (the first was when it was the newly-transferred Digestif during Yelp Eats Week).  What a great transformation from a dark, smoky venue to a warmer, much-more inviting space- thanks to those b/w and prismatic floor tiles!  My EXCELLENT meal consisted of table bread and basil olive oil; the marvelous and perfectly cooked flat-iron steak, medium to medium-rare (cauliflower, golden raisin salsa verde); and the stupefyingly-addiciting puff pastry Chef Charleen created that night w/ AZ pecans, vanilla ice cream, and Wild Turkey caramel sauce (corn-free!!).  I had to muster up all of my willpower to sock-away half of the steak (the raisin salsa verde made this dish a winner!) for my Mom to try at home (she's hard-to-please, but LOVED the leftovers), so that I could demolish the pastry creation :)  [I just recently found out I'm allergic to pecans, but y'know, this dish is so good, I'd definitely keep it in mind on my next visit when considering my dessert options!]  While still enjoying in the aftermath of such a wonderful meal, I was pleasantly surprised to find that my table ticket arrived w/ a small chunk of homemade toffee crunch.  However, this lovely-looking sweet contained an allergen or two, so Charleen switched it w/ a two-bite chocolate chocolate chip cookie.  What a sweet way to wish me good night!  Yelp Eats/Restaurant Week, where are you??",

    "text": "I am so disappointed in my experience at FnB. It started off poorly with the service. It took about 5 minutes for a waiter to come over and acknowledge us (which should never be the case). After asking for another minute to look at drinks, it took about another 5 minutes to order drinks (thus, we ordered food at the same time). After ordering, everything was fine. All the servers were engaged in a timely manner with dishes, refills, etc.   The food is truly the disappointment. As I sit here writing, I am trying to recall the good dishes we had, but I can't remember them. I know we ordered four dishes, but I only remember two... because they were bad.   One dish was the Nashville HOT Chicken Livers. For some, this may sound disgusting. I like chicken livers. I also love hot chicken, but OMG it was HOT. It was too hot where you couldn't taste any flavor. It was so hot it caused us to chug multiple glasses of water. One server noticed this and as she filled our water told us how much she loved hot food, but won't even eat this dish. Yes, it says HOT on the menu which should tell someone it is hot, but my fiance has had Nashville hot chicken (e.g. Hattie B's) and this was too hot. Moreover, the constant chugging of water completely destroyed our appetite.    The other dish that was a disaster was the Shishito peppers. Personally, I feel Shishito peppers are overdone like how kale eventually was overdone, but they are good. You fry them up and season them.  Simple. We decided to try their version because it was different. It was mixed with potatoes and an Aioli sauce. Not to be mean, but it was horrible. Basically, someone dumped a poorly flavored mayonnaise on the plate and poured the veg on top. We had one bite each and were done with the dish and dinner.   I know they can change up the menu, which I love, but unfortunately these two dishes missed the mark.   Another thing that truly irked me - I love to ask servers their favorite dishes. They know best! Nothing bothers me more then when they say everything on the menu is great! Well, I experienced a worse answer. The server said he doesn't ever suggest his favorites. He wants the kitchen to speak for itself. Well, based on the kitchen that night I would have really appreciated his favorites.",

On Saturday, we definitely felt like we had the best table in the city.   FnB in located on a courtyard in Old Town. It spans several rooms with the bar to the far left--it's open seating if you don't want to wait two months. We were seated at a table by the window in the right most room. The decor is sparse but bright.  Our strategy for ordering was simple--stick to apps and small plates so we could try as many things as possible. Badman has been called \"the veggie whisperer\" and well over half the menu is vegetarian. We got the falafel, the grilled asparagus, the celtuce, the spaghetti squash, and the butterscotch pudding.   The polenta under the asparagus was one of the best things I've ever eaten. It was creamy with just a little crunch on the edges. The richness of the egg yolk soaked in and paired perfectly with the asparagus. It was wonderfully elevated comfort food. The spaghetti squash was our other favorite. The tomatoes were tangy and perfect with the sweetness of the squash. Then there was the butterscotch pudding--it was about half whipped cream and half very sweet pudding put it all had about the same texture. It was divine.  FnB was worth the wait and Badman has definitely earned her laurels.",

Restaurants that try too hard, especially by combining basic ingredients in new and contrived ways should give anyone pause.  I had the summer squash with ricotta, pepita's and some other pepper that had some fire.  All that would be good, but what came to me was a big sloppy mess on a plate and not very good.  To be good, squash needs to be roasted really well and through, this was undercooked.  I also ordered the Halibut, which had a similar plating strategy-as much as possible piled high with a heavy hand.  Why ruin a perfectly good piece of fish by deep frying it with a heavy batter and mayonnaise slathered all over it?  The last bites of just the fish made me realize that what I liked was the mayonnaise, rice and sesame seeds.  Why do servers feel it necessary to ask how you are liking your dish while taking your first bite and still chewing?  It's incredibly awkward.  Sorry, FnB is just off for this palate.",

    "text": "FnB Restaurant is a contemporary restaurant located in the arts district of old town scottsdale. They offer a farm focused menu of innovated globally inspired dishes that are meant to be shared, entrees, cocktails and a wine menu that focus on Arizona Wines. Some offerings on the menu you might not be familiar with such as \"Farcous\" (French Chard Fritter), Celtuce (Obscure stem lettuce), Bagna Cauda (warm hot Italian Dip) and many others but don't worry you server will explain. The menu is broken down into cold sharing plates, warm sharing plates and entrees. The menu showcases vegetables but also offers meat proteins embellish with extraordinary vegetables.  It's always difficult to decide on what to order because they offer so many things that sound delicious. I like to order two - three sharing plates..and at least one dinner for two people but often my husband wants his own dinner and we have the most amazing leftovers to bring home. But I figure I don't go here as often as I want to so I try to make the most of my visit.  Whatever you order they start you off with our best locally made bread called Noble Bread and serve it with High Quality Olive Oil. Tonight we started with the Radish Salad that was made with the freshest fanciest radishes that don't taste sharp like super market radishes. They were dressed in caper anchovy dressing with pumpkin seeds and sweet dates. It was a light and delicious salad.  We also shared the Salmon Gefilte Fish Plate. Everyone out there would love gefilte fish if all of them were made like this. So fresh and mild with a light as a cloud texture with fresh herbs. Also on the plate were pickled beets with a really delicious flavor that I'm not familiar with, pickled eggs, beet horse radish and buttered matzo. It all went together really well.  If you like fish you should get the fish dish because it is always fresh and prepared as well as the finest places in Vegas. Tonight I tried the Mexican Grouper...It was so fresh that it just melted in my mouth. It also was over the top delicious with a bountiful pile of vegetables and fancy herbs. My husband tried the Veal Loin and we shared a sharing plate of Corona Beans....Even the beans were like no other....Really plump and sweet in a broth with bright herbs and flavorful provolone cheese.  Sadly I was way too full to order dessert but I usually do because dessert is always great here. Actually I ordered too much food and I had a large box and a small box to bring home.  The Chef for many years now has been nominated for a James Beard Award and this year (2019) is a Semi Finalist.  The restaurant is small and is usually busy so you need to make a reservation.",

It's a quaint place and the atmosphere is very casual and relaxed. You can hear pop music playing in the background but not too loud. My group was having conversations without having to yell at each other. We were a group of six and we were seated comfortably.  They also have an extensive wine list and cocktails.  The food was very tasty and well seasoned. I know now, firsthand, why Chef Charleen Badman won the 2019 James Beard Award. The main dishes were big enough portions that you could share with the table. We ordered for starters: crudite and salad of strawberries. I love the chamoy sauce for the crudite, very interesting pairing. We also tried the grilled summer squash and it's one of our favorites. For the main course we ordered the pasta, chicken, lamb, and the fish dishes (basically one of each) and they did not disappoint!!!   Then, for the dessert we got the old-fashioned butterscotch pudding, butter toasted cornbread with strawberries and strawberry buttermilk ice cream and a rhubarb pie. They're all very tasty but our favorite was the butter toasted cornbread with strawberries. Perfect ending for the meal!   Overall, we will definitely visit the restaurant again when we get a chance. Kudos to Chef Charleen Badman for a job well done for showcasing local products in a very fresh and innovative way.",

    "text": "I visited 3 great restaurants while in Scottsdale, this is the one I would come back to first.   It was truly unique, not pretentious, a bit on the value side of a pricey restaurant town. Most of all, FnB, is oh so different and delicious. Isn't that why we go out, to do something we ourselves could not do better?  The restaurant has 3 rooms it's relatively small with a down market elegance to it.  This will make sense when you show up. The patio is small but a good idea too. The is a quiet place tucked away from the business streets all around you in downtown Scottsdale.  The staff is competent and friendly. We were lucky enough to be there when it was not overfull with patrons. So things worked out perfectly.  Besides the understated elegance the menu takes some time to digest so take your time. It's mostly a fusion restaurant of fine fresh greens and is forward on local goodness. If you are a carnivore and can't stand spending high dollars on greens, then be rest assured there is just enough choice on the menu for that kind of person. Super large parties are probably not going to do all that well here.   FOOD WISE: Enjoy the many blended flavors which is why I nod this place towards 5 stars and not 4. It's the talent and care in the kitchen that is so obvious once you try the amazing food. My favorite dishes were the radish / date starter and the squash. All of it was amazing. If you are True foodie, this will definitely be a special night out.   WINE WISE: It was also the first time I had a GSM from Arizona , and I must say I was impressed. You should try a GSM from Arizona. We tried both of the value choices, I liked the spiciness and finish of the Dos Cabezas just a tad better. Both decent choices at $12/glass. There is a special menu of really top flight bubbly, rose' and other top flight wines if you are feeling the urge to go deep.   Anything on this menu is a splurge, and order up from small to large.  ENJOY!",

It's not only a vegetarians dream, it's great for anyone that is vegetable friendly and if you don't think you are...you will be after eating here!  Don't get confused though, they do offer protein choices as well; such as chicken, pork and fish.  We were a party of 4 and opted for 4 share dishes and one main.  Loved the kale falafel - not the dried out variety you may be familiar with.  No, no, no - this was moist and delicious, yet crispy on the outside on a yummy sauce.  And they kindly served 4 by request so we could each have one.  Another loved item was their long beans.  Fantastic!  But the dish that took my heart was their pasta with lobster mushrooms in a parmesan broth. OMG!  Other items were pretty good too, but those 3 were my fav's.  The best part of our night was a visit from Pavle to assist us in selecting one of their touted Arizona wines.  They are known for showcasing a great variety of local wines and being from CA wine country, we were eager to try some.  He did a great job at pointing us in the right direction and was more than hospitable, sharing history and restaurant information.  The least fav part of our evening was the extremely loud, boisterous table sitting behind us, making it almost impossible to converse.  In hindsight, we should have asked to be moved as I'm sure they would have been happy to accommodate.  Next time, I will...",

The dining room is a bit cramped and the evening we were there, a bit warm. But once the food started to appear, I forgot those things.   This is a vegetable-forward restaurant. But it does serve a variety of proteins if you're not totally into vegetables, like myself.   We started with the Tuscan Kale Falafel, Radishes and Creole Style BBQ Shrimp. The Shrimp was the winner of the first course.   For entrees we ordered the Braised Niman Ranch Pork Shoulder and Dave's Roast Chicken. The Pork Shoulder was amazingly flavorable and tender. Our portion could easily feed two.   Our server Maggie was highly attentive and knows the menu inside and out.",

    "text": "Great food, intimate, and superior staff  Was back in PHX for a work trip and a few coworkers and I wanted to hit somewhere great for dinner. We agreed on FnB based on their rep and location.   The restaurant is a cool re-use of spaces off of Old Town Scottsdale. It's close quarters, but they've made the space work and it comes across as intimate versus cramped. Volume wasn't bad and our group could converse and laugh without having to yell at each other, nor overhear the conversations of others.  The food and service are what set FnB apart. We had an extra person join us and squeezed them in. The maitre d' quickly let us know he was able to play some Tetris with reserved parties and re-sat us with a bit more space. Super chill guys and the crew had our settings moved in two minutes flat. Then came the food. Oh, my. That sweet, sweet food.   The pasta with lobster and mushrooms was mad smackin' tasty and I left no trace of it on my plate. Others had the same and loved it. Also popular were the fish, some okra-base side, and a vegetarian dish that I don't recall. everyone was enthuse about their food.  Dessert was marked by a Semifreddo. I'm apparently an uncultured hyena, because I had never heard of this dish. But I ate it all like a beast and know it well, now. As did two others. Something across frozen whipped cream, ice cream, and nuts. Cold, but not so that it chills your mouth. Basically, it's like kissing a sweet cloud chased by a nutty finish.   Definitely. Go.   nom nom nom",

The waiter was informative but seemed to forget little details like filling up our waters regularly, splitting the check as requested.   As for the food, it was a mixed reviews from our table. We ordered several appetizers which all agreed was the best part of the meal. The summer salad was excellent, refreshing  and very flavorful. The shishito peppers were also delicious.   The squash side dish and Mexican corn dish (I forget what they are named) were just ok.   Three of us ordered an entree. I had the flounder which was good. My husband had the  pork chop which he felt the meat was prepared well but didn't particularly enjoy how the dish was dressed. Our friend ordered the pasta which was slightly over cooked.   Lastly, we figured we would have dessert and ordered the plum upside down cake and the butterscotch pudding. They were not overly sweet which is good but after a few bites, I was done as I wasn't tempted to have anymore.   Overall the appetizers were 5 stars for us. The sides and entrees were 3 stars. My flounder was a 4.",

    "text": "I FINALLY made it in to FnB with friends and we had the most wonderful time! We have been dying to try it for so long and can't believe it took us this long to discover the amazingness. The menu is comprised of primarily small plates with a few entree selections as well. It changes regularly based on what is in season, etc. They're very big on supporting local! I love this. I was VERY impressed with the serving sizes of their small plates and they're also willing to adjust sizes based on how many people are in your party.  We had a group of 10 but split our small plates as couples. My husband and I started with their wild Mexican shrimp, tomato juice, serrano, jicama, hominy, avocado, and buttered saltines. It was served cold with 4 giant shrimp and loads of sauce and goodies. It was INCREDIBLE. It tasted just like the authentic shrimp cocktails that I get in Mexico, minus the ocean view. :) Next, we tried their shishito peppers that had a red pepper/romesco type sauce. They were so mild and delicious. Lastly, we split their cold sliced potatoes with eggs and a grain dijon mustard sauce over the top with herbs. LOVED them. However, if you're expecting warm potatoes, not for this one! We ordered entrees as well so 3 small plates + an entree each was a lot of food! We definitely could have stuck with 2 small plates.   For my entree, I ordered their Creekstone Farms ribeye with a pepper relish, fennel, and wheat berries. The flavors were unique and the sauce almost tasted like a vinaigrette. It also isn't a HUGE ribeye like you would expect, they served it sliced so it is a manageable portion, which I appreciated. The meat was a LITTLE chewy but still had great flavor.   All in all, we can't wait to come back! The restaurant itself has 4 different small rooms. I would say the biggest party size for a night out with friends would be 10 (we took up most of their main room) and definitely make a reservation. It makes a great date night spot and is very romantic. They have fresh cocktails and a lovely wine list as well. The service was friendly and the server was extremely passionate about FnB and the magic behind their food.",

    "text": "I have been to FnB about half a dozen times with my first visit being in 2013. I have not been reviewing on Yelp often back then, so this is actually my first review for this restaurant and my rating is strictly based on my most recent visit in January.  Had I rated FnB back in 2013-2015, I would've given them 5 stars hands down! (See photos from back then in my photos. Nice and bright ones are from back then and the dark and dreary ones are from the recent visit which reflects the ratings as well coincidentally...) Unfortunately, my recent visit was not so good, hence the 2 stars.  I brought my friends who are new in town to introduce them to a great farm to table restaurant concept. Starting with the first dish we were disappointed and I had to send it back.    What we ordered: -Chicken fried chicken livers, green goddess dressing: right away I tasted that it was too bitter.  We realize that it was the batter that was bitter and the liver itself was underseasoned making it inedible. I sent it back. -chilled octopus, pickled caper leaves, oca, pink grapefruit, lemon mayo: this dish was pretty good. Octopus cooked to perfection. Refreshing and tasty dish. -creekstone farms ribeye, grilled potatoes, dried tomato chermoula, baby kale: the ribeye was ok, but the potatoes were amazing. Overall a good dish. -Risotto, rock shrimp, meyer lemon, snap peas, i'itoi onion, basil: this one was favorite out of the entire dinner. Risotto was perfectly cooked, the flavor was spot on. -macau style African chicken, rice, peppers, greens, peanuts. What makes it macau style and what African? Was there harissa in there somewhere? I don't taste either distinctive flavors but the chicken was tender. :D - bottle of 2016 Rune Grenache wine. First time trying a bottle of AZ wine and I was pleasantly surprised. Restaurant price of $64 per bottle tho? I'm not sure I'd order again.  -dessert - persimmon cake, pomegranate seeds, vanilla ice cream. We were excited about the persimmon cake and fully expected persimmon flavor to come thru...thoroughly disappointed. The cake was flavorless and didn't do much for any of us.   The overall food experience was about 3 and the service was 1. Total bill was $235 plus tip. Had the food been great, the price isn't bad. However, with mediocre food and service, I'd rather spend a little more and go somewhere else.   Our reservation was at 6:30, we got our food at around 7:15 pm and we were finished by 8:45. We were having a good conversation and catching up with friends. At 9 pm, the host comes by and apologized and asked us to leave because they have to get the table ready for the next party. It was a 4 top and I didn't see anyone waiting or standing there! She did offer to move us to another area, but I didn't see any other area that was free. This is the first time I've ever gotten kicked out of a restaurant!! Wow. How embarrassing for me in front of my friends and I had to apologize to them for bringing them here. Never again.",

    "text": "It seems that success has gone to the head of this fine establishment. I can't review the restaurant currently because I could not get seated at the bar as a walk in, which was a common occurrence in the old location. I tried twice--there was one open seat when I arrived and when I checked back a few minutes later. I was told that all the seats at the bar and at tables were spoken for over the entire evening, though I asked if this was True for late dinner and was told yes. I went elsewhere but called later to ask if they took reservations for the bar and was told that those seats were reserved for walk-ins! This is a different establishment than the one that received all the awards and accolades. Since I am in Scottsdale only once or twice a year, there will be no repercussions for the restaurant but I wanted others to know these circumstances for their reference.",

    "text": "Even though it took us 2 hours to get seated (no fault of FnB, Joel L NEEDED to sit by the window!), I had an awesome time here last night. See, I get teased a lot for never leaving CenPho.  In fact, Lara asked me \"Are you ever allowed to get out?\" so I knew it was time to finally check this place out. I'd been in touch with Pavle for a couple days.  He's adorable!!  Had to meet him. They have late night eats, which is $10 plates after 10pm.  Score!!!  They had two choices last night: brisket and chilaquiles for the vegetarians.  Once we were seated, it only took about 10 minutes to get our food.  We were served a small veggie platter to tide us over.  There were these little garlic pickles that were to die for!  Kirti even asked for a little extra of these and they were devoured instantly. The place was PACKED.  They were out of the brisket, but seemed to come up with two servings for my dining companions. I had the chilaquiles.  Holy cripes!  They were delicious and came with an egg on top.  I loooooooooooooove eggs.  So much so that I want to marry an egg.  Not Humpty Dumpty, because I'm little, but maybe he has a little cousin or something. Anyway, the service was unbelievable.  They made me some lime drink concoction (non-alcoholic).  I had 3 of them!  Chunks of lime, lots of ice.  Sooooo delicious, especially for a warm summer night. Sitting by the window was the BEST.  Watching the drunk Scottsdale girls stumbling around Old Town made the wait worthwhile.  Watching them park?  Priceless. I ran into a lot of CenPho Escapees there, too.  What does this mean?  That it's ok to venture to Old Town, but *only* for FnB. Thank you so much, Pavle, for an amazing night.  And thanks to my friends, for making me feel guilt-free about leaving my 'hood.",

    "text": "The reviews of FnB seem to fall into two categories, the majority that rave about the place and those don't see what people are raving about.  I have to say, I'm in the minority.  I just don't get what people love about FnB.  The menu is strange in that there are about 15 \"sides\" and apps, but only 4 entres.  My wife and I ordered the cheese plate, the shishitos, the eggplant, the pasta and the chicken.  The three sides/apps came all at once to the small table, leaving us a little crowded and feeling  rushed.  The cheese plate featured a  sliver of cheese, much too much charred nut bread, some dates, some nectarine slices, some pecans, and an apricot preparation.  It was all fine, but not at all interesting or nicely presented.  The shishitos and the eggplant were both pretty bland except for the padron peppers in the eggplant dish.  The pasta and the chicken were both uninteresting and bland.  All evening I found myself looking for a salt shaker.  My wife eventually asked for some crushed red pepper for the pasta.  Didn't try desert or coffee.  Nothing was very bad, but nothing was very good either.  At present, FnB does not have a liquor license so it's BYOB.  There is a $15 corkage fee.  It seems fairly high to me.  The last time I brought my own bottle was several years ago at Quiessence.  I don't remember a corkage fee there at all.  The fee is waived if you bring Arizona wine.  I'm all for eating locally produced foods, but seriously, Arizona wine!?!  The tile floor (left over from Seasaw) is very nice.",

The food is honest and simple yet amazingly delicious, we ordered just about everything on the menu between the two nights and were satisfied with all of the dishes.

I can honestly say that this is probably in my top 3 best restaurant experiences of my entire life. Pavle was our server and had incredible energy and passion about the menu items. Describing in detail many of the menu items, we decided to ask him, quite simply, \"just bring us food\" and the journey began. Pavle brought us small plates and entrees, vegetarian dishes and meat dishes. Interesting ingredients, all fresh and local and presented beautifully to our table in perfect time. Every bite was an adventure and created conversation. Never did we feel rushed and we all couldn't stop raving about all the different dishes we tried. Highlights for me included the turkish lamb dumplings and the falafel with delfino cilantro. We all left with a big smile on our faces and feeling full, but not overally full. I cannot wait to come back to Scottsdale and try the next FNB selections. A most unique and memorable dining experience.",

A little too much for my appetizer but my son helped finish them off.  He opted for the cheese which was unusually good for an American cheese. I ordered the Rabbit dish for my entree. It was wonderfully put together with homemade pasta, a variety of vegetables and seasoned to perfection.  Absolutely delicious! It was a very ample portion and after the shrimp proved too much for me to finish.  My son had the rib eye steak which was cooked perfectly and very tasty. I also ordered a side of roast vegetables which was way too much food.  Having said that, we couldn't resist the yummy looking sweets! I opted for the grapefruit cake and my son, being a chocolate lover went for the chocolate cake.  Unfortunately this is where I think the quality slipped a little. Although both desserts were very tasty, if eaten without the creamy topping the cake in both was on the dry side. I understand that they were both meant to be eaten as a whole with their respective toppings but the cake part shouldn't have been dry.   That said the whole experience was extremely enjoyable and I would absolutely return.",

I've eaten my way through most of the menu and can't find fault with a single item.  Of particular note, the panna cotta with mulberries and kumquats is sublime.  Don't even think of sharing it.  This dish is everything a dessert should be.  A little bit of heaven.  Reserve well ahead of time and sit at the bar if you can, and watch the food being prepared.

Peggy and I dined at the new location of FnB this evening, and our loyalty to the duo of Pavle Milic and Charlene Badman was once again royally rewarded. Spicy broccoli with tangerine aioli and pistachio, and Peg had the hand-pulled mozzarella and leeks gribiche to start the evening.  Actually, seeing Pavle and Charlene began the evening, so things were never in question. I had the roast chicken, which would seem to be a very uninspired dish in most venues. The addition of spaetzle, spigarelllo and pan jus didn't allow that to happen. Peg had the corvina (read: white seabass) with a pomegranate-persimmon, get-your-freekah-on, and Meyer lemon chermoula. Passing the always wonderful butterscotch pudding (gotten probably 80% of the time) we opted for a kumquat lemon verbina creme brulee. Aside from the technical wizardry that Charlene produces, the new place (nee Baratin) had a very comfortable vibe. The rooms and decor are inviting, and it is hard to believe that not a beat was skipped. We told both Pavle and Charlene that we would be happily content with 50% of them on opening night.....we got 100%....as always!  Dr. B",

Did not like the \"butterscotch\" pudding dessert - was not sweet nor did it taste anything like butterscotch.  We did notify the waitress about this, and she did take it off the bill (after exclaiming that no one had ever complained about it before!).  Servers were very casual in appearance and personality - not what one would expect at a resturant where entres are $40.  We also had poor service - seemed like no one waiter was assigned to our table - we had to flag down various people for service.  Additionally the tables and chairs were very close together.  All in all, it was much more casual atmosphere than expected based on reviews.  There are so many great resturants in Scottsdale; unfortunately this was not one of them!",

Reviews highlighted its focus on local ingredients to make award-winning food, and we were not disappointed.

The food was fantastic!  We started off with the leeks and the falafel, which were both delicious.  Husband had the grouper, which was very delicately seasoned, bringing out the simple flavor of the fish.  I had the roast jidori chicken, which was crispy on the outside and juicy inside.

I tried two of the cocktails from the menu- the Milano and the Spring Sundowner.  The Milano was a very flavorful drink that was somewhat bitter, but after a few sips my tastebuds became acquainted to the flavor and I happily guzzled the rest of it.  The Spring Sundowner, however, was DELICIOUS from the first sip to the last.  It was so light and refreshing and delicately sweet.  I'd go out of my way just to sit and sip one of these cocktails.  We had the leeks, mozzarella breadcrumbs and egg.  I'm glad we followed the crowd and tried this before leeks go out of season!  Every bite was delicious with a perfect balance of texture- the tender, smooth leeks with the gooey mozzarella and egg, plus a little bit of crunch from the breadcrumbs.  Our entrees were delicious as well.  I had lamb with artichokes, beans, asparagus and potatoes.  The flavors were incredible- very earthy and rich.  My husband had the jidori chicken with spaetzle.  We've both eaten a lot of chicken in our day, but NOTHING like this.  It was so perfectly moist and flavorful, and the skin had the perfect amount of seasoning and crunch to it.  I was almost jealous that I hadn't ordered it!  But then I had another bite of my lamb, and was content with myself...  We decided to skip dessert since we had friends waiting to meet us.  When our server brought us our check he politely told us \"We don't take \"no\" when it comes to dessert,\" and gave us two pieces of homemade peanut brittle that was crunchy and delicious.  My husband and I don't get many childless meals out, so spoiling ourselves at FnB was a perfect way to spend a night without our girls.  We'll be back for another soon!",

All I have to say is my god, I'm kicking myself in the rear for not coming here sooner and enjoying the delicacy that is FnB.  My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees. The house pulled mozzarella, and the lamb riblets. These appetizers were amazing! The mozzarella came on a bed of white beans and tomatoes with grilled bread, stunning. The lamb riblets, were out of this world and it came with a cucumber salad. I couldn't tell what type of seasoning was on the lamb, but seasoned ever so perfectly.  For our entrees we ordered the lamb, and the duck. The lamb tenderloin cooked a perfect medium rare came with an assortment of grilled zucchini, squash and potatoes. The duck breast again came perfectly grilled medium rare on a bed of rice with chorizo, and I'm not positive, but I think some liver was thrown in, superb.  If it's available definitely sit at the counter and watch them prepare the food. Luckily I was right in front of the grill and I was the master of the grill, Charlene perfectly preparing meats and vegetables. I have to give high recommendations for Pavle as well, as I was lucky enough to have the pleasure of having him being my server. A very outgoing, down to earth person and we exchanged some stories and some jokes. That just added to the experience and the ambiance of the whole restaurant which I love. A quaint, intimate setting, that's not pretentious, where everyone inside is enjoying there company and the delicious food. I totally want to go back at this moment.

Okra= decent. crispy squash blossoms = to die for.   i had the quail. it was decent but nothing special. my boyfriend had the porkchops and felt the same way.   for dessert we had the chocolate pudding and the bluberry shortcake- both amazingly sweet and decadent. we heard you had to reserve your desserts early because they run out... just a tip. anyway, i would go again. great service also.",

My boyfriend and I  had several of the appetizers: the chickpeas, the peppers (which are not on the online menu), and the fried zucchini, which were all very flavorful, I would order all three again, but the fried zucchini chips were truly off the charts. We then split a salad the 'green salad' which has cucumber, grapes, celery and ricotta. I can honestly say I would eat this salad everyday if I could. For an entree we split the halibut with quinoa, which was also amazing. All and all the food was as good if not better than any restaurant out there. My Hangar and soda and my boyfriend's Dark and Stormy were outstanding as well. If I lived in Scottsdale I would dine at FnB no less than once per month.   The restaurant is small and most of the seats are at the bar. I would not recommend FnB for parties of 6 or more. It should also be noted I do not rate restaurants of this caliber on price, you get what you pay for and FnB is worth every penny!!!",

First, the atmosphere was sophisticated and urban, yet relaxed and fun.  I loved how the kitchen was in the middle of the dining room.  You will need reservations on the primary evenings.  We called the night before and still had to wait until 8:15 to get in on a Saturday night.  The dining area isn't huge.    For drinks, we decided against wine and went the mixed drink route.  They had a mulberry elixir that they made themselves that looked really interesting.  It also sounded perfect for the lamb tenderloin which I was planning to order.  My wife chose the Sundowner which was bitter and bubbly with a twist of citrus.  We both were quite happy with the drinks.  For appetizers we split the beet, watermelon, feta salad.  Wow, what an interesting and refreshing salad.  Very complex but light.  As I mentioned earlier I ordered the lamb tenderloin with eggplant and mint.  It was easily the best lamb dish I've ever had.  Impressive.  My wife ordered the pasta, a strozzapreti \"strangle the priest\" pasta with heirloom tomatoes, fresh mozzarella, basil and a housemade pancetta called tesa.  The sauce was very fresh and light and the pasta was cooked perfectly.  For the dessert course we had the panna cotta with a blueberry sauce that was perfection as well as the butterscotch pudding which was incredibly rich with a complex flavor.  How many places serve butterscotch pudding?    Service was spot on and very attentive.  It was everything we would have wanted so 5 stars it is.",

We enjoyed dining outdoors, but as the evening went on, we realized indoors might have been a better option for us with the way we had dressed! Our waitress was very nice and informed us that our plates would come out as they were prepared. We started off with the sweet pea falafel and asparagus with polenta cake and fried egg. I devoured the falafel--it had a crunchy outside coating but was super soft in the middle. Underneath the two patties was a mint cream sauce that complimented the dish wonderfully. Every bite melted in my mouth! The asparagus was very fresh and crunchy. I am not a fan of egg yolk, but my husband ate every bite. It was that good. We then ordered a roasted tomato dish with cheese and crispy bread slices. The tomatoes were amazing--the seasoning on them was pure perfection. Both of us really enjoyed this dish... it was almost like a bruschetta! For vegetables, we ordered the brussel sprouts and carrots. I loved the combination of grapes, brussel sprouts, and balsamic honey. For our main meals, I got the deviled chicken and my husband got the swordfish. He said the swordfish was his favorite dish of our trip so far--flavorful and light. The chicken was okay--I only ate the breast and wasn't a big fan of the sauce. It was a bit spicy for my taste. However, I still left with a very full stomach and would definitely return to this location another time!",

I found this gem by searching for organic, farm-to-table and was pleased with all of the good reviews... We had our 1 year-old daughter with us who was a bit tired and cranky but we decided to give it a shot. Although I know places like this will often sneer at the sight of young ones, they welcomed us happily and even put us at a more comfortable table despite reservations being fully committed. I loved all of the flavor the menu had to offer and was excited to find out the chef was of Hungarian descent which was often reflected in the menu along with other great flavors. Our waiter was extremely well-informed and answered every question in great detail and wasn't afraid to share his personal opinion. Even the hostess impressed us when she asked if she could hold our daughter while we enjoyed our entree and we later found out she is a sommelier!-- which half didn't surprise us because even the wine list and bar menu were impressive. Looking forward to the next time we are in Scottsdale.",

I tell ya what, my definitely in the know host and I were very impressed, so US Airways did a solid job with their recommendation. We walked in early on Easter Sunday and were lucky to sit in the best seats, at the bar, overlooking the grill as owner and head chefette prepared the goods. The food was amazing!! And even knowing that I was a bit crabby from a long day of poolside drinking at numerous PHX resorts, the waitress was a bit creepy. She was too soft spoke, never stopped babbling on about the menu then dropped a dish right next to me thus making me leap out of my chair. Nice. The place still gets a 4, check it out.",

Not realizing that Pavle our waiter was actually the owner, we marveled at how knowledgeable and adept he was, suggesting dishes and explaining their preparations. He even offered a complimentary glass of wine (Arizona-made, as are all of their beers and wines). We were totally impressed. All of our dishes were flavorful and imaginative, from the leek/mozzarella appetizer to my fish entree to my BF's jadori chicken. It has been 4 months since our trip and I still remember the food and the experience vividly, which is saying something since I usually can't remember what I ate yesterday. I loved the open kitchen and the casual gastro-pub environment; it is clear that the food is the focus at FnB. It's a refreshing change from the scene you find at many Scottsdale restaurants. It's a little pricey for my grad student budget, but definitely fair for the quality. I hope to return very soon!",

They have a wide selection of pure cane sodas, which I don't believe are on the menu, so be sure to ask.

    "text": "Before I begin my review, it's important to note that I arrived without a reservation on the night of their one-year anniversary (total accident).  I was greeted in a very unusual way; I was told they could seat me at the bar if I left at exactly 6 o'clock (I walked in right when they opened at 5).  I worked in the service industry for over 2 years and I have never told a guest that they can eat if they leave in an hour.  It's sort of a ridiculous request; as a customer, you can't control how long it takes for your food to come up.  It's also not very welcoming; then again it was their anniversary, I had no reservation and they were squeezing me in.  I think the better way to have handled it would have been to put no deadline on my dinner and quietly tell the kitchen to rush any order I put in. Regardless, I was seated and my server was very sweet and I felt right at home. I ordered the piece of cheese, fruit, and grilled nut bread for an appetizer. I was brought an excellent slice of brie, perfect plums and a spicy fruit spread.  The bread was burned though. Not necessarily worth $9, but still okay. For my salad course I ordered the bloomsdale spinach, sungold tomatoes, pinenuts and goat ricotta. Oh my God!  Amazing. The bloomsdale spinach is this leafy green, similar in appearance and texture to kale without the nasty taste. Because it wasn't limp, the dressing didn't wilt the leaves and the contrast in texture with the pinenuts and ricotta goat cheese was superb. I was really impressed they didn't go with the usual feta. It was susggested I order the pasta, chanterelles (type of mushroom), bacon, tarragon, asiago, butternut squash and creme fraiche dish. I ordered it without bacon and it arrived with bacon.  No big deal, except no one checked on whether I was enjoying the dish; I had to flag someone down, which was a challenge and took 10 minutes.  Normally this would not have been a big deal, but I was on a deadline and only had 20 minutes left. When the new dish of pasta arrived it was so overwhelmed with asiago, I couldn't discern between the mushrooms and squash--all I tasted was cheese and creme fraiche. Also, at $21 for a modest portion, it was slightly overpriced (although I realize the ingredients are seasonal and exceptional quality).  If you do decide to order that dish, I recommend asking for no cheese; the creme fraiche was enough. My server asked if I would like dessert and I said I couldn't--it was 6. He told me he could move me to another table and I could have my dessert there.  It seemed like a lot of hassle and I just wanted to take my leftovers home and enjoy them without rushing, so I declined.  He brought me my check and a yummy minature cookie and I was on my way. Overall, I think the menu is thoughtful but overpriced.  If you are a foodie, I strongly recommend going for the experience but making a reservation first. Bon Appetit!",

These guys (and girls, chef Charleen and sous chef Sasha) have got a wonderful thing going.  Simple, well-executed menu of local/seasonal ingredients.  I'm addicted to their pasta offerings.  Addicted.  I simply cannot dine here without having the pasta dish; fortunately I'm a big eater and can manage that and starters and sides and an entree or two.  Sasha's touch with the pastas is magical, and no matter what the pasta or ingredients, it will rock.  Jidori chicken is sublime, juicy inside and crispy skin outside.  Beautiful, savory lamb.  Ribeye with tapenade-like relish from Charleen.  A wine list of Arizona wines, one of the ballsiest moves I've ever seen.  Grilled asparagus with crispy beet chips...now I make beet chips at home, they're that addictive.  My experiences at FnB have always included excellent service... and very reasonable prices.  My accomplice and I have at least four courses, wine, coffee and after-dinner drinks; our check has never been over $160.    Make reservations for the counter, and let the staff here wow you.",

The agua fresca cocktail was too sweet for my taste so I moved on into a wine recommendation of the Pillsbury chardonday with my appetizer/dinner. I was a little dissapointed with the squash blossom appetizer. The filling tasted as if it was nothing more than \"plain old\" mozzarella cheese. The halibut was excellent over a spiced quinoa and my SO said the Salad of lamb's tongue was excellent. For dessert my SO felt his panna cotta with blackberries was average.  The staff were friendly, helpful, and very knowledgeable about the food and wine offerings. As a couple without a reservation and the restaurant starting to get busy, our dining experience was perfectly paced and we were not in any way hasten to relinquish our seats.

I was completely blown away by our server.  She was beyond competent and efficient.  Note to Scottsdale restauranteurs: it is okay to hire experienced servers that might be over 30 years old.  She greeted our table and answered every question that I had before I even asked.  She was always attentive without interrupting us or being overly intrusive.  Usually, I go on about the food, but truly professional service is such a rarity these days.  I wish I recalled her name.  Anyway, the food was superb!  We had the special appetizer of grilled squid and shrimp and the lamb manti. There was enough for the 4 of us, but it was gone in a hurry.  We enjoyed the tandoori chicken with cous cous and the scallops entree.  Sides of carrots in a yogurt sauce and summer squash.  For dessert, the cornbread with ice cream and the chocolate cake.  I'm not doing justice on describing the food.  Everything was prepared perfectly.  What a lovely evening.  The only comment I have about the chicken entree is that it is served on a board.  It was difficult to dismantle without fearing that it would land on my lap.  Eh, it probably made me slow down and not eat so fast!  Thanks for a wonderful evening, FnB.  Oh, and we really enjoyed visiting the Bodega after dinner and purchasing some Bianco sauce.  The shopkeeper was warm, inviting, and entertaining.",

    "text": "I can honestly say that I just had one of the best meals of my life. Where do I start? We had leeks baked in mozzerella and breadcrumbs covered in a fried egg, a sort of broccoli rabe sauteed with garlic for appetizers. WOW. Next, stuffed boneless trout stuffed with artichokes and carmelized onions for my hubby and a succulent ribeye with finger potatoes and a kalamata olive/olive oil compote for me. Double-WOW. Finally, a trifecta: the most delicious butterscotch pudding with fresh whipped cream that I have EVER had, and my husband's dessert was made of his favorite things ever - zesty lemon cake stuffed with fresh strawberry compote and covered with toasted coconut shavings and vanilla ice cream. The entire meal was unbelievable and the service was impeccable. When we asked our waiter (he might also be the owner or manager) if it were ok to have a slight variation on one of our dishes (we didn't want to offend the chef) we were pleasantly surprised when he told us that since we were paying for our meal, we should be able to have it the way we want it. The wine list is all AZ wines, but those didn't disappoint either.  I highly, highly recommend FnB but book early; there are only about 10-14 tables (in the same location where SeeSaw used to be).",

Fried green tomatoes were fine, but not the best I've had.  Grilled broccoli was good, but not great.  Butternut squash pasta was not well-balanced, and we didn't finish it.  Ribeye was well-prepared, but intensely garlicy.  Interesting Arizona wine selection was generally good.  Butterscotch pudding was sublime.  Everything was overpriced by about 15% to my way of thinking.  Atmosphere was cozy and intimate, but also air conditioning felt like it was set too hot at 80.  Service was attentive, but in watching other tables, I think our server did not take as much time and effort to guide and inform us as others did.  Bottom line, I did not leave feeling like my palette had been as fully satisfied as I'd hoped and expected, especially for the money we spent.  I don't think we will go back, because there are better options, like St. Francis, etc., but we may check it out again once their seasonal menu changes again.",

    "text": "This is a difficult restaurant to review because you simply want to love it.  The owners have spruced-up the old (sadly missed) Sea Saw space with an open kitchen and an eclectic menu.  The room is warm, fun and comfortable.  The staff is eager and earnest.  You want to linger.  The menu is eclectic, although fairly limited.  So, it's difficult to articulate why FNB seems to just miss.  The buzz is there.  The staff works incredibly hard and it's fun to watch the chefs on display. But, although FNB strives to be something more, it remains firmly rooted in the US southwest with culinary offering dominated by familiar strong, electric, flavors.  Specifically, the dishes seem to lack finesse.   The lamb's tongue salad, for example, seems to contain a small herd of sheep.  Fresh corn overwhelms a delicate pasta dish. An iron-finished creme brulee is diminished by an ever so slightly burnt sugar crust.  Unnecessarily strong seasonings dominate a beautifully prepared quail. All of these dishes are fundamentally solid, but could be so much better with a little more faith in the ingredients and a slightly softer touch.  The small AZ-centric wine list is a loving nod to the growing local wine industry, but it really needs some diversity.    Still, despite some shortcomings, FNB is a welcome alternative to the plethora of concept restaurants and deserving of its apparent success.",

I decided to make a reservation for our company Christmas party on 12/3 and when I decided to confirm the time a week in advance  they had no record of the reservation.  I was however able to get a reservation for the 17th.  No problem, or so I thought.  Because of the last slipup I decided to call a week before to confirm.  No problem they said we have you down.  When our party of 7 showed up for our 5:45 reservation they said they didn't have us down!!!  How could this be when I even confirmed a week before!!?? Does this place bump reservations when it fits their schedule?  They did arrange to have a table, but if that didn't happen our Christmas dinner wouldn't have happened.  I give them credit for accomodating us, but come on ,you need to do a better job of tracking reservations.  And when you screw up a reservation (2X) don't say sorry for the misunderstanding say \"sorry we messed up on your reservation\"  That would go over way better.  Normally i'd give 4 stars, but you only get 3 due to messing up the reservation twice!",

    "text": "Y-E-S for FnB! Like last year's winner from the Republic's Critic Choice Best New Restaurant, Noca, this year's winner, FnB, is a recession era \"fine dining\" restaurant...classy but casual atmosphere; intimate service; and locally-sourced, high quality ingredients prepared simply and perfectly! I recommend sitting at the counter and watching the magic happen in the kitchen. The almost-completely Arizona wine list is a unique trait, and the Cabezas Meskeoli white blend was very nice. That said, they are a bit pricey (they probably come from small wineries not benefitting from economies of scale). The food menu changes often, so I won't comment on specific dishes, but I don't really think you can go wrong here...appetizers, entrees, and desserts were all superb! Food prices are reasonable for \"fine dining\"...not an everyday place, but it doesn't have to be relegated to once a year special occasions, either. And if you're a late night person, the special meals served after 10PM on Fridays and Saturdays make FnB even more affordable. I'd give FnB 4.5 overall.",

Peruvian chicken spring rolls, crisp on the outside, soft and savory within, were offset by an eye-opening tomatillo sauce. A spicy-sweet chicken entree was all about flavors that popped, and did so in harmony. I love that Badman respects vegetables every bit as much as proteins. Roasted multicolor carrots with harissa, avocado and dukka (an Egyptian spice mix) amounted to springtime on a plate.  My only regret is that I don't live in Arizona.",

    "text": "I met my friend S for lunch. This place has a small lunch menu. Really small. A snack, a Veg, a salad and two entree's. Both S and I had the sandwich. It was a really good sandwich. The roasted pork sirloin wasn't dry and all the condiments added up to a tasty bite for sure. Well for me, anything with Avocado on it is a winner. And Arugula, I love it on sandwiches. But for all the goodness of the sandwich, the Tabbouleh salad was awesome. Putting both of these on the same plate made for a serious winner of a lunch. My only complaint and why I'm not going for the 5 star rating, is that the menu IS small and the tables are way too close to each other. S & I sat next to another couple and aside from smelling her perfume quite easily, we could hear their conversation and the conversation of the table on the other side of them. There was only one other table with a guest sitting at it but she was by herself and as far as we could tell, she kept her conversations with herself ... to herself. Our server was attentive and the service was properly paced. And our sandwich was priced right at $12. Great sandwich w/ salad, service and prices but not so great seating and small menu. 4 Stars",

My friend and I ordered 5 appetizers to share to try as much of the menu as possible (although we quickly discovered that was too much for the 2 of us, and perhaps 3 appetizers would have been a better sharing choice). I notice that they still have their winter menu on their website as I write this, so their current offering are different:  -Kale falafel: Freshly cooked and served with a delicious yogurt sauce. I'm generally NOT a fan of kale, and yet I loved these! -Rutabaga with ginger creme fraiche: Neither of us tasted the ginger in this dish, but it was still fantastic. Some of the best creme fraiche I've tried. -Smoked salmon salad with grapefruit, radish, & other goodies: Nice and light, great for a hot day. -Poached duck egg with morels and fava beans on garlic toast: Perhaps my favourite dish we had, although it's a tough call with the falafel. -Cabbage and kumquat salad: I didn't get a chance to try this, but my friend loved it!  These 5 apps ran us $60. For the quality and amount of food we got it was more than worth it. Service was great, very friendly and attentive. Lots of veggie friendly options! The location is very nice, as is the vibe. I'll definitely be back to try more off the menu!",

Pavle Milic is a suave front-of-house co-owner, who, along with his great staff, make you feel very welcome on every visit. But all the good graces in the world wouldn't make a difference if the food wasn't good, and it's gooood.  Charleen leads the kitchen and delivers some of the best simple but elegant food in the valley. The focus is on fresh, seasonal ingredients, and the menu is constantly changing depending on what's available. What really blows me away at FnB are the vegetable dishes. I crave them! It's what has brought me back to FnB on many occasions since my first visit. Also, the restaurant opens up late on Saturday nights for \"Late Night Love\", which is a limited menu with a special entree and discounted drinks. Every time I go to LNL, I see local chefs there, and when the chefs come out, you know you're in the right place.",

Appetizers:  - The beets were full of flavor and the special creme freche like sauce really made them pop - The braised leeks with the fried egg were incredibly good.   - The lamb appetizer had mixed reviews.  I didn't think it was special, but two in our party really enjoyed them.  Mains:  - The lamb, artichoke moussaka was full of flavor.  I was fortunate enough to have the last serving.  - The lamb chops are either the best or second best (see braised leeks) item on the menu.  So many flavors that tumble over.  Really enjoyed it. - The sea bass was sea bass.  It was a little more grilled than usual, which gave it a nice flavor, but nothing to write home about - My wife and friend loved the seafood pasta, but I can't comment too much, as I did not partake  Desserts:   - The cornbread.  Well, I didn't have it, but the three in my party that did all loved it - The Eton Mess was amazing.  Instead of strawberries, they used rhubarb.  The tartness of the rhubarb went perfectly with the meringue and cream.  I wish I had some right now for breakfast.  Service:  - Excellent.  Very helpful.  Very friendly.  Great timing.  Except for the end (see below).  FnB would have gotten five stars and still can in the future, but one thing really irked me.  We were rushed out.  The check came while we were still having dessert.  Ok, no problem, but usually you ask for the check.  Then after we had finished dessert and two in our party were still drinking their coffees, our server came and told us that there was no rush but that people were waiting for our table.  Ok, so that's a little off putting.  Two minutes later, the hostess came over and told us the same thing.  Ok, we got the point.  We'd only been there for 2.5 hours and the coffees were still half full.  Not a great ending, but I'll chalk it up as a mulligan and hope it doesn't happen again because the rest of the evening was excellent.  Oh, and they need more comfortable chairs.",

We ordered the tasting menu, preferring to have an experience more than just a casual night out. When we made the reservation we informed them of a gluten intolerance and was still asked if it was ok to serve pasta. The thing is that their tasting menu isn't custom or even specialties dishes, it's just smaller portions of what is already on their menu. Slightly disappointed with that aspect but otherwise the food was amazing. The pairings just made the food all the better. 5 courses in total with one being dessert was the perfect amount to walk away satisfied. Main dining room is small and very loud. Not our typical romantic evening dinner but overall, a great experience.",

When I asked for a whiskey, my waiter seemed annoyed.   My guest and I ordered 6 items from the \"F\" menu, and it seems like they came out either more salty or peppery than the next. The Brussels were inedible due to the salt content. The asparagus plate was overpowered with pepper. The delicate halibut was over cooked, salty and drowning in sauce.  The lamb also was over salted and had so much garlic it didn't even taste like lamb. We decided to try to cleanse our palate with the lemon cake. We each tried one bite, there was virtually no lemon flavor, the cherries tasted off and the ice cream tasted of pure cream.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of gastropubs, and wanted to check out FnB since they are on the Eater X list for the Phoenix area, and I liked what I saw on their menu. We came in before a Giants afternoon game to pick up some food for lunch. They are located in a strip mall type setup, and you won't be able to see their signage from the road, so you'll have to park and walk. Unfortunately, their current menu isn't posted online, and I don't remember exactly what each dish was, so had to guess as best as possible what we ordered:  -Salad w/Pomegranate, Granny Smith Apples, and Parmesan Cheese (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fnb-scottsdale?select=ICiC7fdhDtqHUC8uNf0HrQ#ICiC7fdhDtqHUC8uNf0HrQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fnb-...</a>): This salad was too tart! The pomegranate seeds weren't sweet yet, and the granny smith apple slices were so tart they made my cheeks pucker and twitch. The vinaigrette was also on the sour side. Skip!  -Roasted Brussels Sprouts w/Peanuts, Arugula, and Fish Sauce (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fnb-scottsdale?select=ICiC7fdhDtqHUC8uNf0HrQ#sBdRQZXQ4oi0rJCZDcbk2Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fnb-...</a>): Yum! I really liked the char/crust on the brussels sprouts, and they were perfectly cooked, with a nice crispy to the outer leaves. However, it was a little salty, and I felt like I needed a large bowl of rice to eat it with. They give you a huge portion, so it was definitely worth the price.  -Roasted Pork Sandwich (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/fnb-scottsdale?select=ICiC7fdhDtqHUC8uNf0HrQ#GyWXLJovPSm4s3sWnTFw9Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/fnb-...</a>): Super disappointing! There wasn't anything I enjoyed about this dish. The roasted pork didn't have much flavor and was on the dry side, and the bun was way too thick. There also wasn't enough sauce, so the sandwich overall didn't have any flavor. It was also served with a fregula (or some other type of small pasta or grain) salad, and that was just so-so.Skip!  My biggest complaint with FnB is how long it took for us to get our takeout order! Our server told us 15 minutes or so when we first placed the order, and almost half an hour later I had to grab him to ask where our order was. There were only a few other tables in the restaurant at the time, so I'm not sure what was happening in the kitchen. Our server kept telling us our food was almost ready, and they were packing it up for us, but then another 10 minutes would pass with nothing happening. I'm pretty sure it took over 45 minutes for us to get our food, and we ended up missing the start of the game, which I was bummed about. Our server was nice enough to pour us glasses of water while we were waiting, but I was disappointed with the lack of communication regarding when our food would be ready, and also that they took so long to make everything! I'd hate to dine there when the restaurant is full! There are some stores around there to browse at least, but they need to give their customers an accurate time frame of when their food will be done. I hope they work on speeding up the kitchen (if possible), and also ensuring their online menu is updated. At least parking in this center was easy, but I could see it getting really crowded on a weekend night since there ware other restaurants in that area as well.",

Each plate we ordered made us wonder why we hadn't tasted dishes like these before, and got me to try to recreate some of them at home.  Think clever use of ingredients and each dish had great depth.  We ordered the roasted cauliflower hummus starter dish, followed by the roasted chicken with spaetzle and crimini mushrooms, followed by the brussel sprout.  The roasted cauliflower with pine nuts, dill, raisins, etc on top of the hummus was the perfect appetizer and the brusselsprout in coconut milk-based sauce had great balance of flavors and wasn't like your typical over-buttered brusselsprout at many establishments.  I can't recall the last time I had roasted chicken that not only had great flavors (they added herbs underneath the skin it seems) but was also quite moist and tender.    Wished we had room for dessert, but will def come back here again next time we're in town.",

The food was outstanding you could tell everything was very fresh and the combinations of flavors are incredible. We started with the dumplings which came with a noodle salad with watermelon radish. Amazing. Then we both had the sandwich which was over easy fried egg with thick cut bacon and shaved Parmesan on a ciabatta bread with some greens and a house mayonnaise. It also came with a side salad a mixture of chickpeas quinoa apples mango and some other items. Both were phenomenal. The menu is very small for lunch butt the food was incredible. We weren't hungry for any dessert but the waitress offered of butterscotch putting so we decided to share it. Unfortunately that was the only downside to the meal. The putting itself tasted more like a salted caramel then butterscotch and it had a very grainy texture to it. When you had that fresh and light of a sandwich the pudding was way too heavy. It would have been better to have a fresh fruit parfait with fresh whipped cream. Would highly recommend and is definitely our new go to restaurant while in that area. The bill for two people was $44 which was one appetizer 2 meals and two drinks.",

I can at times be a Bay Area food snob but this place really blew my mind away.  As soon as my colleagues and I walked in, we were pleasantly surprised with an intimately set up table for three and was introduced to a knowledgeable professional server. I hate that I never got her name!   Don't be afraid to ask what some of the funky sounding ingredients are; the waiter will guide you through the menu.   My colleagues and I ended up choosing about 4 of the smaller appetizers- oh the wonton, yuzu salmon dish was heavenly. And please try out the eggplant dish too!   This would be an ideal place if you: 1) Care about what goes in your body; health conscious yet still a big foodie 2) Love vegetables  3) And desserts (how can you not?) 4) Prefer an Intimate, quiet ambiance  5) Look forward to Farm to Table, beautifully concocted and creative dishes   As a side note: Our server had to move my group to a table a foot way because a group of 8 was congregating at 10pm. To thank us for our \"move,\" our lovely server treated us with THREE DESSERTS.   WHAT.   I know...  If it's your first time in Phoenix, please stop by this place.  I promise you won't regret it!",

    "text": "When I first heard about this place going in to this little space in  Scottsdale, I initially thought it was going to be an Italian restaurant...a cute little play on the Italian alphabet.  F'n A, F'n B, F'n C...I know...not really Italian at all...more Brooklyn and Bronx.  But it's not Italian at all...it's world food...world class, world of comfort, world food.  After a number of meals at FnB over the past year, I'm trying to recall a dish that didn't knock my socks off...and I can't think of a single item!  Last night was no exception!  Chef Charleen was in the kitchen giving everything from roasted chickpeas and a little piece of cheese, to fried green tomatoes and braised leeks, her special touch...innovative, imaginative, interesting...but never at the expense of the food itself.  She uses simple ingredients, her skill and imagination, and obvious love for the art of cooking, to make every dish special and astonishing.  One of the things I love about going to FnB is just walking into the place...You can tell it's going to be a great meal just from the fabulous aromas coming from Chef Charleen's kitchen...plus, who doesn't like the Technicolor floor in this place!  The Beautiful Carin and I have had a few things to celebrate lately and another terrific dinner at FnB seemed like a fitting way for us to enjoy a lovely Saturday evening together.  In addition to sharing our braised leeks and fried tomatoes and what-have-you, we spent our dinner feeding each other Red Snapper (pan-fried with a dusting of cumin and couscous) and pasta with bacon and morels...satisfying and rewarding entrees, that delighted us both with the flavors and with the quality of the food and the preparation!  A quick word about the service at FnB...and that word is \"welcoming\"...Pavle and his excellent staff encourage you to linger just a little bit longer...to enjoy your conversations and relax with your meal...to enjoy the ambiance and the fact that you are in another world for while.  So we did...with coffee, cordials (Chartreuse will set you free) and some of the best little sweet treats you will ever eat...Butterscotch Pudding that is sublime in both its simplicity and subtlety and Chocolate Date Cake...nutty, chocolaty and cinnamon-y.  People occasionally ask me to name my favorite restaurant...I know, that surprises me too!  When they do ask, I'm generally hard pressed to pick out one particular restaurant from the five or six that I would consider the best places I've ever eaten...and FnB easily falls in that top five.  But I will tell you that if I had to eat at only one restaurant for the rest of my life...I would do just fine at FnB!",

We tried a couple of the appetizers one being a Carrot Socca which was the hit of the night.  The menu does change seasonally so be prepared to be adventurous.

I've come here with friends, but I've also come alone & felt totally welcome. I like sitting up at the counter, and I've actually met some really great people to chat with there. Pavle & Charlene run the place, & they are the kind of people who always make you feel like they are glad you are there.  Chef Charlene does things with food that make it amazing, & these are things that I myself could never accomplish. My main cooking skills involve a microwave or a menu.

We received excellent service from Pavle, who co-owns the restaurant with the chef, Charleen. We arrived and were welcomed to sit wherever we saw an open spot. We chose the bar - which actually overlooks the kitchen. Great choice!  We were able to watch our food (and everyone else's food) be prepared and banter with the chef about the awesome ingredients.   Although the menu is small, there is plenty for everyone - and they are ALWAYS willing to make whatever you want. I ordered the salmon and my boyfriend ordered the chicken. Both were delicious and perfectly prepared.   Along with an excellent staff, impeccable service and the highest quality ingredients, the drink menu is equally appealing. Be sure to grab some Arizona wine when you go!  Cheers and thanks so much, FnB!",

We arrived in 3/07 with no reservation but figured we would see if they had space.  They offered us the three seats at the bar which ended up being a fun place to sit.  Servers were very chatty and energetic making it fun.  Ordered some veggie plates to share (leeks and egg, spicy broccoli, beet salad). All were superb.  The portions were larger than expected.  Had we known, we would have skipped the pasta entree.    The entree unfortunately took almost 30 minutes to arrive with no one checking in on it or us around the delay.  This was the one miss in the service.  When it did arrive, it was good (but we were FULL already). Our one observation was being surprised at the use of a premade spaghetti for the pasta.  Given the style of restaurant, house made hand cut pasta sheets would have gone better with the dish.  They talked us into dessert.  Great butterscotch pudding and lemon cake.  Don't know where we put it all!  All in all a great and recommended restaurant that would earn 5 stars if the portions were more appropriately sized, the entree delay was addressed, and the pasta was fresh versus premade spaghetti.",

    "text": "Went there with some friends for my wife's birthday. It was our first time there. Our server was Nathan, who was fantastic. He was extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu and honest too.   I've been hearing about this legendary Leek appetizer from other friends for 2 years, so regardless of all the other delicious sounding appetizers I ordered them. Frankly, I don't know what the fuss was about. It was good, but i was expecting something dynamic, something I would remember for a long time. However, along with our appetizers Nathan suggested this artichoke and chick pea snack. It was very dry, flaky artichokes, with chick peas, salt and a splash of lemon. It was amazing. We finished it and ordered another one right away. Substitute this for the leeks.  My entree was the Lamb Chops. These were also out of this world. Plenty of black char on the outside, cooked perfectly and seasoned just right to let the lamb speak for itself. I love trying new things on the menu, but I will probably come back and order this again.  FnB just vaulted up to near the top of my list of \"if someone is coming into town and they only have one night to go out to dinner\" places.",

Six of us came here for a late night dinner. We ordered several different things on the menu and shared. I was not impressed with one thing i tried, and most of our group felt the same way. The blossoms were luke warm and over fried. The salame sandwich which was described as cheesy goodness barely had any cheese on it. I ordered the butterscotch pudding which was described as \"to die for, people rave about it\". The pudding was gritty, chalky tasting and not good at all.   The best thing that several of us enjoyed was the random cookie that came with the sandwich. This should not be the case.   Pavle was so kind and took the dessert of my tab. The service was great but for the price and the taste of food, I will not be returning to FnB",

    "text": "When there is a huge following to a restaurant, your expectations are set a lot higher. From the food to the service it was a major disappointment. Watching kitchen and FOH staff, walk through the restaurant, outside through the front patio to their storage room a few doors down was an annoyance. We were just there a little over an hour and at least 8 to 10 trips were made to their storage room through the restaurant. Our server seemed like he didn't even want to be there. He didn't even introduce himself, when he brought our veg out, he sat it on the table and said, \"Here's your veg.\" While still at our table he proceeded to start talking to the table across the patio. When we had hardly touched the veg, that should of been an indicator of how much we disliked the soupy tasteless mess of spaghetti squash and roasted tomatoes. The spaghetti squash dish was watery with bitter acidic tomatoes. The yogurt cheese had a foul taste, as well as the chickpeas. We only ordered veg, because of the great reviews on their veg. This was completely disappointing. The bean tostada was very basic and overpriced for what it was. The cabbage slaw needed salt and acidity. My husband choose the lamb burger and I decided on the #sundaylove special, General Tso's Chicken, which was more like #saltylove. Going from two dishes that were in desperate need of salt, to two dishes that were overpowered by salt, really showed the inconsistency of our meal. The rice served with the General Tso's Chicken was sad, it was clumpy and mushy. Rice is a basic and I excepted a higher standard than what was served to me. Based on this experience I would not return.",

I moved from Los Angeles and am trying to re-establish my list go-to restaurants and FnB seems to be a Yelp Favorite.  First off, like others have pointed out, it's not a gastropub.   The service was good, which is why this gets 3 stars. The food is very ho-hum. It's not terrible, but it's not great.   We had the braised leaks with egg -- good, but not particularly memorable. The halibut was cooked well, but once again nothing special. The 1/2 chicken was also cooked well -- crispy skin, moist inside -- but the basmati that came with it was super dry and the spices were just a bit off. Almost mediterranean? Almost moroccan? Really neither?  Overall, a $95 dollar meal that was not bad, but nothing to write home about. I'm going to keep looking.",

    "text": "Happy birthday to me! Possibly the best dining experience I've ever had.   My date had dined at FnB on more than one occasion and talked it up quite heavily. Between trusting his palate and the 5 star direction of Pavle Milic, I literally didn't have to make any decisions. None. Being the control freak that I normally am, I really enjoy when someone else takes over and just 'makes it happen' for me. It's sexy. This time was no different. I wouldn't have changed a thing.  We started off with a couple of perfectly crafted mint juleps and tasty marinated olives. I don't venture into mint julep territory very often but I'm glad we did. Light, refreshing and the perfect beginning to what would end up being over 2 hours of gastronomic sensory overload.   The menu is forever changing; one of the perks of using only seasonal/local ingredients.The Braised leeks, mozzarella and over-medium egg is a little slice of heaven on a plate. Throwing an egg on almost anything will make my eyes light up. It's like bacon in that way...a no brainer.   As for the entree, I had the jidori chicken and spaetzle. Holy WOW! Had I not known that it was chicken I would have assumed it was some sort of exotic fowl that I shouldn't legally be eating or maybe even WANT to be eating except it's so damn tasty that I can't stop, so ya...  This was a first time spaetzle experience for my half German ass (sooo pathedic, I know) and it was superb. I have no comparison... but I am a dumpling fearing texture-phobe and let me just say there's nothing to be afraid of here. Insanely good! I did only have one bite of my guys lamb dish, though it too was excellent.  I have a True soft spot in my heart for local wine and I've never seen a list composed entirely of such. Kudos FnB!  I don't remember what we chose (see what happens when someone else does all the driving) but it pared perfectly with our meals.  One more thing.....don't ever let anyone tell you that lemon cake and butterscotch pudding don't go together. They do. Let them scoff. The only rule is that there aren't any.",

    "text": "NY and Chi town foodie snobs...AZ has finally blazed into your picky palate! I needed a relaxing place to eat and stumbled upon FnB. I liked the ever changing and concise menu. The farm fresh ingredients, creative pairings, and relaxing atmosphere hit the mark. First up was the Hummus. Red roasted pepper hummus, feta cheese, pine nuts, turkey, and green beans were only a few of the delectable ingredients. Complete with warm crisp tortillas in chili spices and olive oil for dipping. Now I will dream of hummus and feta together. A match made in foodie heaven? I think so! Have you ever thought...does beer go with hummus? Surprisingly, yes! Prescott Brewing Co. has a Liquid Amber Ale that will rival any wine. Microbrews are in the running now. WooHoo! This sudden foodie discovery resulted in me devouring the dish. Result...I didn't have room for my entree! Seven hours and a fabulous hair appointment later, I ran back to the fridge. Waiting patiently for me was a sandwich with a delightful blend of veggies. Which included: roasted summer squash, pickled radishes, spicy coleslaw, pinto beans, carrots, avocado, egg, goat cheese, a savory sweet grilled bread, with an addition of shredded pork (thx to Jackie's recommendation)! Addicting? Yes. I thought I did not have any addictions. Thanks a lot FnB. Now I have to come back for a fix. A job well done on reeling in another devote customer. Guilty pleasures of not going to the gym shall ensue.",

    "text": "I can't believe I forgot to write a review for FnB, I feel like I've been singing their praises since I first stepped foot into that welcoming atmosphere! First let me begin with how much of a joy it is just to meet Pavle Millic; he is by far the friendliest and most doting personality I have ever encountered. The menu is an interesting read, nothing that I would ever consider creating myself, but it all sounds intriguing.   My first visit to FnB was with a group of foodie/wino friends and many of them had visited before. I let them recommend their favorites and then went and ordered the only items they didn't have covered, so we could try just about everything on the menu. I am SO glad I did, as I would've missed out on the best trout I have ever had... scratch that, probably the best fish I have ever had as a whole. I cannot begin to describe the symphony of flavors that Charleen has created in this trout dish, just try it... whether you like trout or not, just try it. That's not to say I wasn't impressed with the braised leeks in mozzarella with mustard bread crumbs and a fried egg on top... delish. The crispy rock shrimp and salads are also terrific.  FnB also has an all-Arizona wine list which is why I was eager to support this place, but it goes so far beyond the locavore/locapour effort. Overall, dining at FnB is a wonderful experience with a comfortable atmosphere, amazing aromas, top-notch staff, and incredible flavors. I've stopped in several times just for a drink or dessert and it feels like I'm walking in to visit family. Someday I'll make it in for the late night specials... they tempt me every time!",

Of particular note was the roasted cajun chickpeas, and the duck with merguez and rice.  They have a few decent craft beers to go along with it all, as well as wines by the glass. Dessert was quite a treat as well; I had an interesting twist on butterscotch pudding that was delectable.",

Our server, Brian, was so attentive throughout our meal, offering wine tastings and checking up on us to make sure we were doing okay.  Yes, F n B is a tiny restaurant perched among many \"trendier\" spots in Old Town, but this was some of the best food (and LOCAL wine) that I have ever experienced.  Choose this spot for an authentic meal, some great vino, or just stop in to see Brian!  FnBest,   Natasha",

    "text": "I just ate at FnB last night. It was the BEST meal of 2011 for me and probably the best meal that I have had in Scottsdale. This restaurant bucks the Scottsdale trend of theme restaurants playing trance music and providing good, but not great, food.   Pavle Milic has created a True local restaurant that serves food that comforts the soul and a warm, inviting ambiance that never fails to make one feel welcome (this was my second time at FnB).   The jidori chicken was amazing. The rutabaga was ethereal as described by Mr. Milic. The best dish we tried was the grouper. The fish was amazing in terms of its nuanced flavors and perfect texture.  The wine list (all AZ wines) is also a plus as it will surprise you how well they pair with the food and stand up against wines from more well-recognized wine regions.  I hope this review pushes FnB over the top to five stars because it deserves it.",

Waitress highly knowledgeable about all ingredients (so what IS a quark?) and Arizona wines (pretty good!) and very helpful all around. All dishes - starters, salads, that carrot risotto - were just perfection. The butterscotch pudding was a dream and that grapefruit cake captured the essential flavor of grapefruit - which is really, really, really hard to do.  Sat outside on the micro-patio and enjoyed the lovely evening breeze.   I wonder if Chef has read the Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake? For I believe she is Madame. The food loves her.",

    "text": "Look. This place is hard to review because what I ate may not be on your menu. And that's the beauty and splendor of this place. Every temporary dish is what other restaurants would hope to tout as their signature, legacy dish.   Hell, FnB shouldn't even show you the menu because when you look at it, all the ingredients confuse you and leave you with so many questions. A lamb manti what? A what-kind-of falafel? And who is Sina making the sauce? Pasta with what kind of sausage?  It doesn't matter. Try it. All of it. Stop looking at the menu, trying to figure that shit out. You can't.   Here's what I always do: I pick a main entree and a wine.  Then, I just stare at the always helpful server and ask, \"what side dish best complements my selection?\" They always recommend a winning combo. Then, I ask, \"What is one absolute must-have for starters, and what's a novel one you're most excited about?\" I order both of them. Every time I do this, I get an amazing experience.  And save room for dessert, but skip the cheese/apple dish if it's on there. I found it to be too stale relative to all the flavor in this restaurant.",

When we asked the waitress if we could add another small table to accommodate the other dishes we ordered she barked back that she then wouldn't have that one available, despite being there early and the restaurant was less than half full. Very knowledgeable bartender and decent cocktails, but the wine-list was uninspiring..... I get it you want to highlight regions such as Loire and showcase the differences....just have some non esoteric non offbeat wines on the list as well!   The lamb was good, the grains excellent. Polenta was amazing, the curry chicken was \"sold\" as an authentic Indian flavor explosion....it was undersalted and bland!  At this point I would have still given it 4 stars.... but then the shocker.... the flourless chocolate cake was smothered in whipped cream and totally stale, definitely several days old.... Went straight to Virtu afterwards to have another fantastic dessert!",

I really appreciate the diversity of influences and the liberal use of vegetables and herbs.  That said, do not avoid the proteins - the pate is unctuous in the best sense of the word and any lamb offering on the menu will surely please. Shared plates is the way to go to sample as much as possible and they are generously portioned.  Thumbs up for the AZ forward wine program and the knowledge and passion they bring with all their offerings.  If you want unique, local and excellent in PHX/Scottsdale FnB is not to be missed.",

    "text": "After several people recommended this place, we made a reservation for Saturday dinner. We wanted to try a bit of everything so we ordered two small dishes, a vegetable dish, and a main entree to share. To start, there was bread and olive oil that was infused with a bright, perhaps fruity, flavor. The crispy chickpeas were a nice snack. The Peruvian chicken spring rolls were fantastic - very flavorful and with a nicely thin fried wrapper. Perhaps the most interesting dish, flavorwise, was the spicy grilled summer squash with fish sauce. Very savory and innovative. The grilled half chicken was tender and tasty, but the accompanying rice was overly sweet, to the point that we only ate the rice that was less covered in sauce.   Overall, we found all of the dishes to be on the heavier side (maybe just because of our picks) but the flavors were amazing and creative. Service was great. I will definitely return to try some of their other dishes.",

We tried the terrine, fried squash blossoms, eggplant, and tile fish. I loved the terrine and tile fish. Really liked the squash blossoms. Just liked the eggplant - it was in larger chunks and ended up kinda mushy. However, I still liked the way it was served with some sort of yogurt-y sauce over the top.   Overall, I would award FnB 5 stars.  HOWEVER, I dined (as I often do) with my husband. He is a solid meat-eater. He did not appreciate the focus on vegetables. He did not appreciate the beef-free menu (although at other times, beef may be offered). He wished there were more options overall (only 4 entrees). He did, however, like the wine and the service.   So overall, 4 stars. But don't take a beef-lover there.",

Mid-Course: Fall Corn on the Cob - Calabrian chile l basil l pecorino l pumpkin seeds. This undoubted is the corn either on or off the cob I've ever had! Amazing!  Entree:  Pasta-fresh made in-house l lobster mushrooms l bacon l basil l zucchini l crumbs. Gentle ribbon pasta with a light taste blended perfectly...the bacon was a marvelous touch! Great dish!",

I happened to choose this restaurant by chance on a nite a friend and I were looking for some place different and nw to go to.  I'm so very happy that we did.   this is a small establishment with the kitchen practically the center piece of the small space.  The kitchen is surrounded by the bar.  If you're lucky, you can take a seat there.  BTW, you may make a reservation to be seated at the bar.  I think the restaurant is quaint and has a romantic feel to it.  (This review is based on the old location.  They've since moved.)  That night, I was so happy with the service.  The waitress was kind and thoughtful.  She was very busy.  She was playing hostess as well as waiting on tables.  She explained things on the menu and suggested drinks to us.  I don't recall the mixed cocktails, but we each had 4 different cocktails between the two of us and enjoyed the variety of the flavors in the drinks.  The cocktails were original drinks  We ordered the okra fries, I'm not sure what I was expecting, but they were just \"ok\" for me.  I was not that impressed by them at all.  However, the dinner was a different story.  I had a wonderful dish with duck in it and my friend had a chicken dish.  Both of the entrees were enjoyed by us both.  The menu changes frequently.  I just visited there 2 months ago and I looked on line to see if I could spefically name the dishes, but the menu is completely different!   I recommend this place for date night!!  It's also nice for out of town guests who enjoy food and think of a meal as a grand experience.",

We will be back many more times. Looking forward to experiencing more from their ever changing menu. Do yourself a favor and visit FnB at your earliest opportunity.   Second visit and what a disappointment!  This time, because of the summer heat, we sat inside. It was hot, loud, and cramped.  The food lacked both the wonderful taste and presentation we enjoyed on our first visit. The service was adequate at best. I apologize to all that used my previous review as a basis to visit FnB.

I started with a cocktail: the Cranberry Presbyterian, a ginger ale with cranberry-infused vodka.  I giggled when I saw it listed under the heading \"Potent Potables\", because Jeopardy.  It was strong and tasty, not quite as cranberry-heavy as I expected, but fresh.  We also had a number of small plates to start, with my favorites being the Peruvian chicken spring rolls and house pulled mozzarella (pictured) as well as the pork rillette.  For my main course, I had the pasta with duck confit, lentils, foraged mushrooms, spigarello, and bread crumbs.  The pasta tasted deliciously fresh, and the combination of flavors didn't taste like anything else I'd had before.  The kudos and recognition this restaurants receives (including two James Beard noms for the best chef in the southwest) don't surprise me a bit!  The service was fantastic and the food was too.  We didn't have the right headcount and they were able to move some tables and accommodate more people quickly, not an easy task in a small restaurant.  Our group was still talking about how great the experience was the next day.",

It felt like the flavor/texture/spice/temp balance of each dish had been studied for years in culinary labs around the world.  Whoever is setting the prices is definitely smoking crack - OR has b-list goals in philanthropy as I believe they could easily charge twice as much for each dish.    And the service - perfect in every way.  Our server (Ian, I think, #222 on the check) who looked like a younger cuter Ben Wyatt was super knowledgeable and totally not precious about the large collection of exotic ingredients in the dishes - and very patient in explaining origins and in assisting with French pronunciation!  Bonus!  He had excellent suggestions, fantastic follow up, great casual sharing of fnb vision and purpose without being preachy or pompous.",

Not one bratty kid in site. It's kind of a date type place. It's pretty quaint and quiet. In fact, it feels very French to me. The service is spot on amazing. No complaints there. The have a wine list of death so order away but be ready to pay! My favorite part was learning so much about food just from the menu. I had to look up no less than 10 ingredients on my phone just to know what I was ordering. The menu is not in French. The ingredients were just things I'd never heard of. It was a great dining experience all around!",

We really splurged and tried literally almost everything, hehe, but let me share my recommendations.  The bread soup was surprisingly delicious, deep sensuous flavor of green, and the bits of bread were so crispy, a nice contrast. The roasted broccoli was just perfect, perfectly slightly charred and flavorful, simple but oh so good. the heirloom carrots with some sort of harissa sauce - wow and actually, my favorite thing on the menu was the orange salad with pistacchio & tarragon. It was legit the best salad I've ever tasted. The lamb manti-little lamb meatballs - SO tasty, almost crispy on the outside. The falafel was outstanding, perfect little fried balls, that somehow tasted light and refreshing.  ok- soooo i pretty much recommend everything? i guess :) oh, and save room for the chocolate cake. trust me.",

Overall, the food was incredible. The flavor profiles made sense, eat plate had a perfect contrast of textures,  and each dish had a little something unexpected that just made everything POP! The flavor combinations are to die for, and I highly recommend the summer squash salad, porterhouse pork and the cornbread dessert.   We will be back! Keep it up FnB.",

It's such a rarity in today's society that you can go anywhere and be treated with respect that finding a place where they do service right is truly a gem. FnB is doing this amazingly well. My first impression even before anything was served to us was so positive based on the kindness and temperament of the staff. Go here to be treated right!  5 stars for food: The menu items were very unique and interesting with flavors that married well. We're in love with changing seasonal menus as it gives us incentive to keep coming back to see what they've got going on, and that's exactly what we're going to do. We had the verde salad, goat cheese stuffed chiles, halibut entree, and pork chop entree on the Summer 2017 menu. Delicious. Delectable. Unique flavors combined that soared.  4 stars for interior: The interior was cute and cozy, but left something to be desired. A lot of the guests were pretty dressed up for their dinners and seemed kind of out of place when sitting inside the restaurant. The interior design seemed to encourage more of a casual vibe rather than upscale, but hey do it up, folks.  Will return to check out the Fall menu and perhaps get a seat outside in the cooler weather :)",

Some sounded great to me but my friend just wanted to stick to drinks and bread. Told our server and she seemed annoyed by that.   Our lemon drops were wonderfully made. However it took her 10min to fill our 2nd round when there were maybe 5 other tables in the restaurant. We asked for bread to munch and first plate we got 4 pieces. When we asked for round 2 on drinks AND bread, again we had to wait about 10min for drinks..15 for 3 pieces of bread.  Our waitress had a bad attitude and seemed stoned. It's a cute place that I'm sure could've been a much better experience with the right server. 3 stars for the awesome lemon drop.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place. I heard amazing reviews about the food and service, but sadly our experience was terrible. We went early -  6:00 pm on a Saturday night. We knew it was a small restaurant and there really isn't a great table, but could overlook it due to great food and service. It took the waiter more than 10 mins to greet the table and take drink orders. When he came back we tried to ask questions about the menu and place appetizer orders and all he said were the things we were looking at were \"salads,\" and that we needed to place our order all at once, \"to give the kitchen a head start.\" We were so confused - did we order appetizers or not? We should have walked out then. When you are paying close to $40 for a main entree -  this type of service is unacceptable.   Our waiter didn't make any recommendations on the menu and seemed less than interested in our table. After 15 mins he came back and we ordered 2 mains, a salad, and 2 appetizers(for 3 of us). One appetizer came - the Kale Falafel - which was tasty. The other never did. The dinner orders came out over 1/2 hour later. It was obvious we were sharing the mains, but no plate was brought for sharing. The Asian Pear salad I ate was over salted and tasted only of onions. The mains, the pork chop and chicken, were good, but not great. After an hour and half of terrible service in a cramped restaurant, I was done. The waiter was much more interested in drinking wine with another table than providing any service to us. It takes just one person to ruin an experience and he sure did that. I have received better service at Chipolte than FnB.   For the price you will spend on a mediocre meal, there are many, many other Scottsdale restaurants that offer better food and MUCH better service. I am sad to say I won't go back and would only recommend this restaurant if you want to be ignored.",

After a small stumble with a server about where I could sit, I chose the outdoor patio. (This review is for a visit in February.) It was pleasant to sit outdoors after escaping San Francisco's cold rain for Giants Spring Training in Scottsdale. Go Giants!  A  friend advised me to visit FnB due to my being a vegetarian, and FnB delivered. I wanted to order everything on the menu that was vegetarian, and asked Pavle to decide for me.   After good bread served with fruity olive oil, I ate Tuscan Kale Falafel with a tzatziki style spicy sauce. Who needs kale salad after this delicious appetizer?   Next was a beautiful, refreshing salad, with just-picked tasting ingredients. Salad as art. I loved the green apples in combination with cucumbers.   Meat eaters could be happy with the vegetables as entrees. Pavle chose butternut squash, whose sweetness was highlighted by the miso butter and almonds. Flash-fried cauliflower with lemon-caper yogurt and purple sumac were equally good. The Chef creates innovative flavor combinations. The portions are large, so I took food home for the next day's lunch. Tip: try the famous butterscotch pudding. I will next time.   The lady food runner was very pleasant. Don't forget to check out their cute store of local products. Great experience and great food!",

Their salads are always sufficiently dressed but are never drenched, if that's even possible.  Their service is spotty sometimes which I unfortunately got the worst of during my last visit. I had a waiter who took three minutes to seat me, despite being visible from waiters station and kitchen.   Even then I wasn't a priority. I was seated at two-person table in a corner of the restaurant, which was still visible to everyone who passed by. I do not ask much but to have my drink refilled at a decent rate which it wasn't.   I had an appetizer which was taken away fairly quickly after I was done, but I don't think it was by my regular waiter. Then finally when I was done with my main meal, I waited at least 15 minutes to have my plate taken and get my check.   The wait staff and my waiter were clearing a table across the room but still didn't notice me across the way, despite having pushed my plate away and tinkering on my phone, which is the nonverbal way of communicating, \"I am ready for my check now.\"  I wouldn't have gotten my check if I hadn't flagged my waiter down.   I'm always appreciative of the quality in food I order at FnB, but I won't be back for awhile for the way I got neglected during my last visit.",

As in, did I mention it was topped with a perfectly poached (local, organic) egg?  The space is itty bitty, but the ambiance is intimate and effortlessly charming (kind of un-Scottsdale, do I dare say?). Do yourself a favor: make a reservation. They were totally booked when I visited around 8 pm on a Wednesday night.  With a focus on AZ wines and locally sourced ingredients, this would be a great spot to bring out-of-town guests or potential in-laws you'd like to impress with your sustainable eating habits and sophisticated palate. Just make sure that if the in-law thing doesn't work out, then you get dibs on this place after the break-up. It's really too small to run into an ex without things getting awkward.  Speaking of awkward, our server described in a detailed and faintly condescending lecture EVERY SINGLE ITEM ON THE MENU. It felt like an episode of Portlandia. I did not ask if he knew the chicken's name or how it got along with the other chickens, but it took all of my willpower. All of it. Which means I had no willpower left to resist eating more than my fair share of leek heaven. Or dessert. Pronounced \"yum yum yum\".  I do love the locavore concept and the thoughtfulness behind the food. And I plan to return, even if a lengthy lecture is part of the menu.",

    "text": "You must eat here! It's as simple as that. Still not convinced?! Read on...  We are out of towners visiting the area on holiday and a friend recommended this place, although they hadn't been here, but had heard great things.  To start with, my wife ordered the pate and I the fried green tomatoes. Both were delicious options. My FGTs were tangy, zesty and extremely fresh in a light batter. The secret sauce was superb and complimented the tomatoes. The pate was plentiful, meaty and juicy: just how it should be.   For our entree, my wife ordered the chicken and I went for the short ribs. We shared a side of brussels sprouts cooked in a fish sauce, rather than the curried. WOW. Order these and do not be put off by fish sauce.  The chicken was tasty, with the right amount of garlic. HOWEVER, my short ribs were out if this world. Incredible flavour, succulent, beefy, clean and probably the most amazing short ribs I've ever had. I'm not exaggerating.   You will not be disappointed if you choose to eat at FnB. I will return.",

Menu is in constant change which again, if you know your food and gastropubs well, you will know that just like the Four Seasons; everything must be changed to fit the harvest of the present. Their pickling of vegetables is an art. A little pretentious some might say. I couldn't disagree more. This food belongs at a larger establishment to hopefully reach the minds and palettes of other foodies.",

The patio is GREAT and the inside has a very intimate and mellow vibe to it so it's beautiful for a date.   I like to consider myself fairly adventurous when it comes to food, but the menu threw us off guard and nothing looked very appealing. We decided to have a glass of wine and moved on to Cien Agave for dinner. It seems like everyone else like it. Perhaps I'll go back with a better idea on what to expect and a more open mind!",

    "text": "Amazing gem of a restaurant. Went with 3 others while on a business trip. Everything from the appetizers to the main dishes were exceptional. A True farm to table, the ingredients felt as if they had been just picked / foraged and then expertly prepared in a way that was creative yet not overly so that the taste of the ingredients were lost. From the composition to the texture to the taste, every dish hit the right note. I'm glad there were four of us so we could order a bunch of appetizers and try everything in addition to our mains. Portion sizes were perfect, when the appetizers came we were all surprised by how shareable they were (maybe we're just used to small new york city apps). Overall, I loved everything about this restaurant, I am actually hoping work brings me back to Arizona again just so I can eat there.",

The food was excellent, prepared expertly and clearly with love. The wine list is handpicked and packed with gems.

    "text": "I'd been wanting to go to FnB for the longest time and based on reviews and word of mouth I was excited. I knew that meals could be pricey, but I didn't mind based on how good the food was supposed to be.  My friends and I had a reservation so there was no issue with having to wait once we arrived and that was awesome.  When I got there I was promptly greeted. The staff was very friendly and didn't have the attitude that people accuse servers at Scottsdale restaurants to have.  We took a little time to decide what we wanted to drink and the staff was fine with us taking time to make a decision. When we did order our wine was served within a reasonable time...except for my glass. And once everyone else's drinks were delivered the server seemed to disappear. It probably took about 15 minutes for a server to come back so I could ask for my wine that never got served. I got my wine shortly after asking for it, but no apology for the error, which I didn't care for. Felt a bit like an \"oh well\" situation.  When it was time to order, I had wanted the salmon but was informed they were out. I could somewhat understand this though as we had a later reservation (8 pm). I decided to order the pasta with sausage instead. The dish had good flavor (great seasoning and not too salty) and was a good portion size. The herbs in the dish were fresh and flavorful. Was it an entree worth the $19 price tag...not in my opinion.  Now that I've been, I can say I've been, but don't have to go back.",

    "text": "I was stoked to find a highly rated Farm to Table restaurant to enjoy during our brief stay in the area, and even chose lodging to be within walking distance of FnB.  I apparently have a very different ideal, based on quite enjoyable meals at the Nest in Portland, Art of the Table in Seattle, the Chicken and the Egg in Atlanta, Allim in Great Barrington, which I've reviewed as well as number of other dining establishments all the way to the iconic Chez Panisse  in Berkeley.  I'm a Farmer's Market, Farm to Table cook who prefers chickens from my local small farmer butchered the previous day and greens picked from my garden in time for dinner, tomatoes that haven't had the flavor dulled by refrigeration.  A previous reviewer described FnB as follows:  This would be an ideal place if you: 1) Care about what goes in your body; health conscious yet still a big foodie 2) Love vegetables 3) And desserts (how can you not?) 4) Prefer an Intimate, quiet ambiance 5) Look forward to Farm to Table, beautifully concocted and creative dishes   To this I would say: 1) I care about what I eat and enjoy good ingredients well prepared. 2) I  rate restaurants on how well they prepare vegetables more than what they do with the protein entree.   I was a vegetable breeder and know how good they can be when bred for eating rather than long haul transportation and processing. 3) Desserts?  It seems rather counter to caring about what goes in your body to dump sugar into it, but heh, if it floats your boat, why ever not? 4) I greatly prefer an intimate quiet ambiance, not the loud cacophony of high ceilings with nothing to break up the sound and the room crowded with people trying to be heard.  We couldn't hear each other, let alone the wait staff.  5) The dishes were indeed creative, and beautifully concocted.  The food quality going into the dishes was less than expected, vegetables included.  The steak was nothing like our usual grass finished dry aged  beef and the chicken was tough and lacked the distinct chicken flavor of our local pastured fryers.  I'm not sure where the Farms are that FnB sources  for their Table.  I certainly haven't seen any driving into the Phoenix area. Perhaps they are doing the best they can with what they can source in the desert.  The lager was sweet and the by the glass wine selection is  limited to AZ and NM wines, which I find too sweet to drink.  I can understand that they are catering to local tastes, but FnB does not compare favorably with Farm to Table restaurants elsewhere.",

This family-run place is bustling w/ foodies, and pulls off consistently great meals using fresh, local ingredients + service w/ pride & love. As a solo diner, I didn't think I'd need reservations...and I was almost wrong! 7pm on a mere weeknight & there was only 1 seat at the chef's bar left.   Service = 5 stars.  Immediate, efficient, so warm & welcoming. The back-of-the-house is actually right there in the open. Sit at the chef's bar & the ladies will talk up a storm w/ you. Incredibly attentive on refills of water, wine, delivery of food, whatever your need - super pro!   Wine = 4 stars.  Since the focus is on AZ/local fare, you can imagine it's an extremely well-edited (focus on edited) list. A+ they offer a 375ml Gruet blanc de noirs for just $15. Best deal on the list!   Food = 4 stars.  Ordered a handful of small plates instead of an entree so I could try more things. Rock shrimp was tender & just cooked right, grilled broccoli was very tasty (albeit a bit cold), braised leeks & mozz also tasty but very rich.   The biggest a-ha was that the amazing olive oil they use - I guarantee you'll love it - is $4/btl from Trader Joe's! The staff will be thrilled to tell you all about it, too, so be sure to ask.   Will definitely go back, as the menu changes seasonally. So wonderful to have a food option in Scottsdale other than the dime-a-dzn Coyote Ugly-type bars & poser sushi joints.",

My other beef is about the \"B\" in the name. In my mind, there would be some expectation of real drink options based on the name alone.

    "text": "I could rave on and on about fnb, but that'd just be repetitive given what everyone else here has said. So instead, I'd rather just give you my   TOP 5 TIPS for a LEGENDARY FNB EXPERIENCE  1. Call ahead. Atleast a week, because the days of popping in are long gone. My impression is that if you're willing to take the old people slots (REALLY early, like 5pm) or the raver slots (the latest seating), you're good to go. But that sweet spot 7pm seating? You can't call early enough.   2. Relinquish control of your drink choices. FnB has one of the most talented mixologists in town- his cocktails are made of unicorn dust and leprachan DNA.  Relay your tastes and something magical will appear before you, whether its a cocktail or wine perfectly suited to you.   3. Don't overthink the menu. Its divided into four \"parts\" which loosely translate to \"starters, more starters, possible side dishes but could also be starters, and entrees\". Don't try to outsmart the menu, like some guests of mine have, just pick a few starters, an entree and a few sides for the table. There is literally nothing on menu that could be bad, so share everything.   4. FnB vegetables contain opiates.  This is not scientific, but purely observational, because FnB has over the past year made me love fava beans, spaghetti squash, and rutabagas, none of which I have ever been gaga over. They just do something great to veggies, and at some point i'll learn to order nothing else while there. Dear Pavle & Charleen, I hate brussel sprouts. If anyone could change that opinion, it'd be you.   5. If there are leeks on the menu, order them. Do not pass go, do not collect 200$, just go directly to leeks. This seasonal dish is legendary- an odd mix of mozzarella, braised leeks, breadcrumbs and an egg. Its heaven.   The unwritten rule is this: introduce yourself. To Pavle, to Charleen, to Colleen, to Emily, to everyone on staff. They are the friendliest, warmest, most wonderful people, and good friends to have.",

I am not a fan of basic sandwiches, but with recommendation by FnB staff I went for it.  The mix of hummus, turkey, avocado, even feta cheese made a great dish.  I even liked the pickled corn and peppers.

    "text": "Absolutely superb.   My boyfriend made reservations about a week ago for my birthday dinner last night at FnB. They called him earlier in the day yesterday (Friday) to confirm, which I absolutely love.   We arrived 15 minutes early but were seated immediately by Pavle. He pulled out my chair for me, called me all different terms of endearment, was incredibly attentive, etc etc.   When my boyfriend asked if they had lemonade, Pavle said \"no, but I have simple syrup and lime juice in the back. How about a limeade?\" It seems silly, but that was such a great touch. Also, the limeade was awesome!  We ordered the moz/leeks/egg dish and oh, wow. The leeks were cooked perfectly, the bread crumbs added the perfect crunch, and the egg mixed with the delicious, warm, gooey mozzarella was the perfect mixture of tastes and texture. Wow.   We also ordered the grilled spicy broccoli with pistachios. Perfect amount of spiciness - not so bland that you're questioning where the heat went, but not so spicy to where your mouth is on fire for minutes afterward. The broccoli was thick and cooked perfectly - grilled and still crisp.   Both my boyfriend and I are vegetarians and were told that we could order a specially made plate. Because we were so full from the two appetizers, we split a vegetarian entree.  And again ... wow. We were given a plate overflowing with food. It was a trio of dishes - broccoli with (we think) cumin rice and a tomato garnish/sauce, potatoes with pea pods and (I believe...) spinach, and beans with spinach, and an array of green leafies. Each bite was more delicious than the one prior. We hardly talked as we devoured the food. So good, so tasty - everything was seasoned perfectly and perfectly cooked.   I was so excited to have a vegetarian dish that wasn't just pasta with a vegetable thrown in. It is so nice to have an innovative vegetarian dish that truly felt like it was made creatively. Pavle told us he truly appreciated the assessment of the vegetarian food, and we let him know how absolutely wonderful it was.  He also let us know they have a vegetarian tasting menu once every few months, which trust me, we'll be going to.   Overall, one of the best dining experiences I've had in a very long time. We truly felt like we weren't burdening the (amazing) staff with any requests or questions. They were all so friendly and attentive.   We will definitely be back to FnB.",

I wish they had more items on their menu though. This place is definitely not good for kids because they probably would not enjoy the food. It is very pricey here so you would not want a big party - main courses are 25-28$. I would go back pretty often but only on special occasions realistically. Couldn't afford these prices haha. Overall it was an unexpectedly good experience to try unique combinations of foods.",

    "text": "One of my favorite books  is Michael Pollan's \"Omnivore's Dilemma\".  Pollan explains how humans have the rare luxury of being able to determine what to eat from a virtually limitless supply of options. Not only can we choose what foods to consume (meats, grains, veggies, dairy, etc...)  we can narrow down that decision to cuisines, preparation styles (raw, steamed, grilled, etc..), the food's source (local, industrial, pastoral) and if the food was scientifically altered somehow (molecular gastronomy, genetic engineering, hydrogenation, etc..)  Choices, choices, choices!  While I love food, sometimes I just don't want to think about it anymore. I want to let the professionals take over. The good people over at FnB are the pro's I have been looking for. I had dinner there last Saturday night. I could break it all down for you and describe each dish, but I want this review to focus on the general concept of placing your trust in a restauranteur. While I have only been once, I now trust that FnB will serve fresh, local produce. I trust that the menu is simple and seasonal. I trust that I am not a mere piggy bank funding their next concept restaurant. I trust that the chef will produce really good food without cutting corners by adding excess amounts of salt, butter, cream or sugar (don't insult my palate's intelligence). And I trust that members of the kitchen staff get paid more than the decorators or \"ambiance engineers\".  I trust FnB to follow through for me so I have no regrets.  I'm definitely going back soon. In fact, what the hell.... I'm going back next weekend. Hope to see you there.",

    "text": "Hands down, FnB is my favorite restaurant in Arizona. This small gem in Old-Town Scottsdale is a unique, classy place with food and service that are nothing short of stellar. Sitting down at the high top bar that encompasses the cooking suite is my favorite place to dine. Being able to engage with chef Charleen Badman and the kitchen staff as they prepare your food is a key element in the dining experience. However, the unforgettable experience begins as soon as you walk in the door. Pavle Milic runs the front of the house and is the most sincere and charming man you will ever meet. His passion for serving and fussing all over patrons gives FnB a unique charm. The interior makes you feel like you're in a street-side cafe in New York.  I've been here many times and decided it was finally time to write a review. I remember last year I brought my mom in on Mother's Day and we tried the Braised Leeks with the Fried Egg ($13). We wanted to try a dish that was different than something else we would normally order, and this hit the spot. No wonder it was listed as one of the 10 Best Restaurant Dishes of 2010 by Food & Wine. This was an amazing dish, and something only Charleen could come up with. I love her dynamic approach to taking the \"ugly\" vegetables and turning them into delicious food.   Pavle features an exclusive Arizona wine list, and rightly so. Arizona wines have much to offer and Pavle is a strong supporter of Arizona wines. I am a huge fan of Sam Pillsbury's wines, and always happy to have a glass of the Diva or Roan Red ($13) at  FnB. Pavle also does cocktails right. The Sundowner - Aperol and bubbly ($9) is done perfectly, reminding me of my trip to Italy. For a special after-dinner drink, the Chartreuse VEP ($16) is an exquisite beverage and worth the splurge.   Pavle, his wife Emily, Charleen and the whole staff are one of the main reasons I go back. Their friendship that was built through this little restaurant is very valuable. The food is innovative and takes simple food and does it in ways that you wouldn't have thought.   One final note, working in the foodservice industry, I absolutely love the late night food that is available on Saturday nights from 10-midnight. The vibe changes and it's a hangout where you can grab a great dish (chilaquiles!) and a cold local beer.",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations are getting high...but why not?   We went to FnB last night and the menu lacked great choices.  The whole menu except for the last 4 items and one item on the top was all vegetarian.    We started with the cheese plate and it was a small slice of blue bree,nuts and burnt piece of nut bread that we witnessed being scraped off after it was burned and a blob of yucky apricot goo...wouldn't the dish washer tell them no one was eating it?  Next we had a braised leeks with mozzarella with a fried egg on it...it would be fine as a side... but not an app?  Next came the pasta...it was ok, not house made it had a heavy sauce and a lot of chewy mushrooms,squash cubes and wilted bacon...nothing special.  Dessert was a steamed chocolate cake that was dry as a bone served with a table spoon size scoop of banana ice cream...the coffee was pretty good.  The tap water was even bad so we ordered bottled...  I fear that the owners are cutting corners and making things that are easy to make with the small quarters they have.  We have been many times before and the menu has been more inspired and so has the food.  I hope they are not getting burned out...",

One note they are now BYOB with a corkage fee for Beer and Wine. No fee if the Beer or Wine is from Arizona.  One note for FnB we were preplexed with the lack of pork on the menu :-)",

    "text": "Go. To. FnB.  I just recently had my anniversary dinner at FnB with my girlfriend and it was truly a phenomenal experience. Char, Pavle and Emily deserve every pleasant thing that I've heard about them, and they certainly deserve every single star in this review. I felt like a \"guest\" (I want to stress guest because I didn't just feel like a customer) the whole time I was in the restaurant. Oh, and I noticed the same treatment to the rest of the guests in the restaurant as well; Pavle knows what he's doing.  Oh, yeah! Food!   We tried a lot of different items on the menu by splitting everything, and I couldn't have been happier. We had the eggplant with pomegranate, za'atar and yogurt, a cauliflower dish that was substituted for the okra dish, the braised leeks and the pasta with creme fraiche, bacon and butternut. Every single dish  was very well crafted with multiple layers of flavor and texture, but they were very simple when it came to ingredients. I would really like to say that there was one thing that I would call favorite, but I can't. If the cauliflower stays on the Fall 2010 menu, it's worth a try. The eggplant was dreamy to me because I love za'atar. Za'atar is a simple Middle Eastern spice blend that adds a great flavor to most things it is put on, and it brought the eggplant dish together. The braised leeks? Well, I now understand why critics are crazy about them... Fantastic mozzarella, mustard bread crumbs and leeks covered with a gooey eggs? Count me in anytime. Lastly, the pasta. Bacon is really a wonderful thing to see when looking at the description of a pasta dish  that already had butternut and creme fraiche. It didn't disappoint; scrumptious until the last bite.  Oh my... I've gone on and on. I couldn't help it though, FnB was and is a place with hype that does not falter when faced with customers ready to be blown away. It was worth every penny and I can't wait to head back down to Old Town the next time I want to have a great meal at a classy (and cozy) eatery.  PS: My girlfriend and I also had the butterscotch pudding for dessert. Wow, just wow...",
