When I looked at the menu, I'd forgotten what it felt like to be able to order anything on that extensive menu! I had the wings and a bacon burger! Definitely going back soon. The drinks/teas are so good and refreshing! They need to have another restaurant closer to the west valley!",

I got the Kung Pao noodle bowl with mock chicken and it was delicious. The sauce was spicy and flavorful. The veggies were fresh tasting and not overcooked. And I couldn't believe how tasty the \"chicken\" was! I don't know what's it's made out of but it really did taste like chicken.  They were super busy at lunch but they kept things organized and brought the food out pretty fast. I also liked all the healthy beverage options. I would definitely eat here again and any time I am asked for a vegetarian restaurant recommendation this is what I will say is the best in the valley.",

I liked the peanut stir-fry with mock chicken so much in Tempe, I ordered it again at the downtown Phoenix location.  Unfortunately, this version of the dish was drowned in so much peanut sauce, that its all I could taste.  The veggies and mock chicken were cooked right, it was just that the dish was out of balance with too much of a powerful ingredient.",

    "text": "So the wifesky said we should eat something healthy today and wanted to give this place a try. Well, if the little lady wants to try this place out, that's what we'll do!  Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix on N 7th. Street.   A word of caution, if you use Google Maps (like I did) to search for this place, it'll show you a location on Scottsdale road (2240 N Scottsdale Rd #8 Tempe, AZ 85281) which obviously isn't the location for this restaurant as listed by Yelp (2022 N 7th St, Phoenix, AZ 85004).  I'm not sure if they're both affiliated or not. When you're driving on N 7th St. and you don't know what you're looking for, it's easy to miss the restaurant. The signage is large but it's decorative with decorative writing so drove past it.  The entrance too can be easy to miss as it's a bit small and the signage to enter was just as small. The parking is very limited and also....small, so if you've got a monster truck or SUV, you might have difficulty parking in the back.  Parking is also shared with their sister restaurant called Nami located next door that apparently serves vegetarian pastries.  We were lucky to snag a parking spot however, if the parking lot was full, then I'm not sure where else we would've been able to park. (-1) The outside had the usual seating for dinning but was small in size and close to the busy road. The interior was also on the small side. At first we didn't know if we had to be seated first and wait to be waited on, but after seeing a line forming by the cashier, we promptly joined it.  Apparently what you do is grab a menu, join the line, and while you're waiting to get to the front of the line, you choose your items to order.  Then you pay, you're given a number which you place at the edge of your table of your choosing wherever you wish to sit providing there's seating. I'm guessing if the place was packed, I'm not sure where we would've sat.  Perhaps we would've ordered to go.  Menus - the menu was self-explanatory.  The cashier who took our orders answered any questions we had about the food and the drinks.  Service - once staff brings out your food, we didn't see them again checking in on us.  Seems like they're there to either bring out the food and clean the tables/area.  Food - I had the big Wac -- 2 hand packed vegan burgers, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions on a sesame bun and the thyme fries (you can choose fruit or a tahini salad). The thyme fries didn't taste different than regular fries which I guess is a good thing but it was certainly crunchy, fresh, hot, and very tasty.  It certainly wasn't oily and greasy like regular fries was. The vegan burger also didn't taste like a vegan burger and in fact, I thought I was going to be biting into a piece of cardboard.  While it wasn't meat from ground beef, it was certainly very tasty and didn't lack any flavors as I thought it would.  In fact, the special sauce, cheese, pickles, and onions only served to enhance the flavor of the veggie burger patties itself and brought out the taste even more.  Even the sesame bun was soft and fresh as if it was just baked.   I think the various vegan items on the menu is enough to bring me back however I'm a bit leery of how small the establishment and their parking is.",

All the mock-meat and tofu dishes are overly heavy on oil, even the rice/noodle bowls feel super greasy. Maybe their salads are on the lighter side, but I've never tried any because I opt for junky delicious options, like their mock wings.    Their drinks selection is noteworthy, as it is vast and great (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic).  Oh, and I hate how they nickel and dime you for everything--like if you ask for extra sauce on something, they'll charge you for that.",

    "text": "I never once thought that one of the best burgers I've ever had would come from a vegan resturant, but it does. I'm not vegan, or even vegetarian, but I've been to Green numerous times and while I've enjoyed many things on their menu, I keep going back for their \"Big Wac\", their version of the Big Mac, or \"BBBQ Burger\", their BBQ bacon burger. They're delicious! The texture and flavor is exactly that of the meat version of the items they represent. They have everything from healthy options that you would expect from a vegan resturant, to bar food style options like mock buffalo wings and chili cheese nachos. There really is nothing negative to say about this place. I can't even think of an \"it might be better if...\". This is definitely a must try! Make sure to hit up Nami right next door for coffee and dessert when you're done!",

I have only tried a few of the other items because the wings are just so good and addictive.  It blows my mind that fake chicken can taste that good. o_o But I can say that the crab puffs and egg(less) rolls are also great. Every time, the food is great, the service is timely and also friendly. I only wish there was one closer to my house! I certainly hope they open more locations.",

    "text": "This restaurant is inspirational!  Read on for details...  It is a tiny little place which does a great job of circling people through.  You walk in and up to the counter where you order from the overwhelming menu!  The menu is adorned with specialties and allows for much personalization in most dishes.    I do recommend starting with their famous wings!  They are quite spicy but the sauce is exquisite.  The crab rangoons are also a nice, refreshing twist on the Chinese deep-fried goodness... these appear to be baked and come with a really light dipping sauce which packs a bunch of flavor.  For the main courses, the menu is overwhelming!  I have tried the buffalo chicken sandwich which is their same spicy-amazingness sauce in the wing appetizer and comes on a submarine roll (which is a little too large for my fancy but filling all the same- I just opted to pull one half off of it).  I have also opted for something named with diablo in it-you can order it with rice or noodles (i opted noodles) and you can pick your choice of meats to add in.  This dish was swamped with veggies!  The flavor was an explosion!   If you made it through the first part of the review, please note that everything I have talked about is completely vegan/vegetarian!  That's right... everything is made of textured soy and mushroom to create a meat-like product for the dishes.  I have even \"tricked\" people into eating this food without them even knowing they are eating meat substitutes.  That's right!  Full-on meat eaters who would never order a dish at this joint were raving about the tastiness of their meals!  If you order to go, you are given wooden utensils and smart packaging... which I love.  portions are generous and you won't leave hungry...  I would even venture to say that an appetizer and meal by your lonesome is too much food!  You must be with others to indulge in both courses (unless you want left overs).  I am slowly making my way through everything on this menu.  I eat here for every single meal I possibly can when I work in Phoenix (almost weekly) so I will update once I have conquered.  See my review for Nami, it's sister restaurant in the same parking lot... I am in the LOVE!",

I don't usually order veggie burgers at vegetarian restaurants because they are standard fare at most places now but I made an exception because it came highly recommended and I am so glad I did; it was spectacular! The wings were also fantastic. The Po'boy was really good but didn't wow me as much as the others. We also went over to their sister bakery (nami) next door for soft serve and I would suggest you do the same- So. Good. Can't wait to come back to both places!",

They told me the wait would be about 20 minute. I got there at a few minutes past 8 and the place was jam packed. I wouldn't recommend coming here if you're looking for quick service on a Saturday night. I could see my order finished and waiting but I had to wait in a line of about 5 customers. Not a big deal, but I think it would be beneficial to have a line specifically for to go orders.   I waited in line for about 10-15 minutes and got my food. I brought it home to my girlfriend (whose vegetarian) and we sat down to eat. She got the BBQ sandwich and it looked and tasted great. The wings were awesome too! My only problem was my cheesesteak. I don't think it's normal for it to only come with one bun (on the bottom). It still tasted good, but obviously it was a bit messier than I was hoping for having only one bun.   All in all, the food was great and I'll be sure to come back. I may not order to go again though.   Cons: Parking, order pickup, lack of buns.   UPDATE: Came again to show my mom and brother. The food was much better. I think it does taste better fresh out of the kitchen VS. Out of a to go box. I had the Po Boy sandwich and loved it! Much better experience this time.   Best of all, they gave me 2 buns this time :)",

    "text": "Been on a kick on cleaning up my diet and was on the search for alternatives meat products, that not only tasted good but was wallet friendly. I've heard little blips of how yummy Green's items are and found that their Secret BBQ Sammie is one of the best mock chicken sandwiches you could order!  Green is conveniently located next to Nami which serves up soy-based ice cream, pastries, desserts and coffee. However, I needed food-food and Green serves up some of that and it is all plant-based! Green also serves alcohol, if you are so interested. I ordered the Secret BBQ Sammie, a side of fries and got their House Made Strawberry Lemonade. Items are a la carte.  The space is a bit small but has a patio out front and out back. Big windows to allow bright light in. There's bar seating and tables. The staff was really friendly and informative.  The Secret BBQ Sammie has slices of thin mock chicken, slices of bell pepper and carmelized onions in a espresso bbq sauce and vegan mayo. Legit BBQ sauce, it was tangy, sweet, hint of spice and then some. The mock chicken was thin like sheets of tofu, but had a texture similar to chicken but with more bite and chew to it. I really enjoyed it, it's one of those things where you can appreciate it's similar characteristics while still being it's own thing. The bun itself held pretty well to it's filling and did a good job of soaking up all the BBQ sauce. The fries were okay, they didn't seem hot or fresh but are the typical thin cut fries. I ended up taking half of my meal home because it was really filling. The house lemonade was good, I also tried their limeade and found both to be refreshing while not being overly sweet.   For price point I'm pretty impressed, this meal with a drink came out to be around $12 which is not bad for a plant-based meal that actually tasted legit!   Parking is a bit of a pain here during lunch time and turning into Green or Nami on 7th can be a bit of a hassle during peak times. Despite the traffic, I'm excited to try the other things Green has to offer!",

The interior decor and seating arrangement just made it seem more of a rushed dining setting than the Tempe one. Not that that is necessarily a bad thing, but just something I noticed right upon walking in.  I got the Secret BBQ Sammie, which was one of the two sandwiches that could be made gluten-free (the other being the Original \"G\" Spicy Po-Boy), and even though I could have gotten it with their gluten-free bun, I was in the mood for more vegetables, so I asked for it without any bread and just on a bed of salad greens. WOW IT WAS GOOD. And the espresso BBQ sauce they used on the mock \"chicken\" and the onions and peppers? I wanted to lick my plate clean until every drop of the sauce was in my belly (but I maintained some dignity and didn't).  Also unlike the Tempe location, I'm not sure if there is a dish return station, and if patrons are just expected to leave their dishes and utensils on the table when they're done. Because I ended up feeling awkward trying to bring my plate and fork back and not finding any place for dirty dishes. But this meant a lot of the tables weren't bused right away, so finding a clean table to sit at outside was impossible until an employee came to clean the tables.  But otherwise, a good place to get a hearty vegan (and gluten-free if you desire) meal in Phoenix!",

This is my only 2nd vegetarian restaurant I've ever tried and for now Mew Green American Vegetarian is my #1 go to stop when I want a burger. Omg their famous Big Wac burger is the best vegan burger I have tasted so far and it is well worth penny. I order the famous Big Wac and Buffalo wings. I had to bring the wings home because I was full of the Big Wac alone and the 2 cups of raspberry lemonade I had which by the way was delicious as well. Don't take my word go check them out yourself I promise your tummy will thank you and you will be thanking me for this review lol. Enjoy!",

I wasn't aware that I was supposed to stand in a specific spot to get service. So when a couple was about to jump me in line, I made my presence known. The cashier made a huge deal about me not standing where she was expecting me too. As she was helping me, I described an item I saw on their menu online but she made it seem as if never existed. Then after she helped me, she apologized to the people after me as if I was an annoying customer.   To make matters worse, as soon as my plate touched the table I noticed ALL my food was cold.",

I got the coconut curry with fake chicken meat - I could have been fooled it was the real thing. My friend got the coconut curry with tofu, which had so much flavor. The curry bowl came with brown rice hidden under a pile of healthy and crunchy steamed veggies, all smothered in a flavorful yet slightly spicy sauce. The only factor was that the curry didn't have much of a coconut flavor, but it was still really delicious.   I have absolutely no concerns about the ingredients that are used- as far as I know, Green is very transparent about their foods. Definitely the place to go to for people wanting healthier choices other than salad. I would recommend trying this place, even if you're not vegetarian. You would be surprised!",

After 5 or so visits, I've never had a bad meal. Lunch seems to be pretty popular here - but never a terribly long wait. Order your meal at the counter, grab your number, find a table, and wait for delivery. The staff are always friendly and smiling - I don't think I've seen someone sad or unhappy to be working here.   On a recent visit the girl at the counter sold me on their daily special, this day's was a bratwurst; vegan of course. Coming with a few options for the side, I settled on their house made coleslaw; which I thoroughly enjoyed. The bratwurst was tasty with a dijan / spicy mustard and sourkraut, but the bun seemed to span the width of three brats and was sliced more like sandwich bread and not like a hot dog bun; I can live with that minor complaint though. I've had their hummus and buffalo wings appetizers, a big wac (their shameless vegan big mac), a thai penut bowl, ranchero salad, and one or two other dishes I can't quite remember at this point; all vegan, all delicious, with my favorite being the ranchero salad - it's my normal go to option here.  I believe I've answered the question of would I come back by actually coming back, once every month or so.  Happy Yelping Phoenix. This spot totally makes it easier to be green ;-)",

Out of the two sandwiches, I like the Wendy's Pickle best because of the crispy breading and the perfect pickle taste.

Their mock meat game is totally on point, and they use quality ingredients.   I especially loved the half sized pieces of walnut in my pesto bowl. Really a nice surprise.

The menu is very user friendly with juices, sandwiches, salads,  burgers, and small bites in which you can mix and match.  It's almost hard to decide but what I love about this place is if you get their handhelds which is the burgers and sandwiches you get to choose your side and there are all kinds to choose from fruit to vegan chile to coleslaw and even brussels sprouts.  Now I know there are many people who hate brussels sprouts but believe me they probably make the best ones in the entire planet, if you don't like these then yes stay away from brussels sprouts period:).  My go to dish is the dagobeah jungle which is a fancy word for jerk spiced brussels sprouts over salad tossed with a jamaican dressing and tortilla chips. You can also get this as a wrap.  If you don't like spice then avoid this dish but if you do you are in for a treat.  It's got this great spice and the brussels sprouts a so amazing the way they char them.  It's perfectly filling for lunch.  The burger here is also like crack and I love that with coleslaw.  Now here is the deal.  This place is so reasonable it's almost like I feel guilty how little I pay for such a great fresh meal.  I end up tipping handsomely even though you walk up and order yourself.  As far as beverages they have a whole line of fruit drinks from teas to ginger lemonade and you pay one price (again cheap) and you get unlimited refills.  This is cool because I got to try them all.  Some are a little sweeter than I like so I stuck with the tea and the berry one and added water and ice to make it exactly how I wanted.  It's all self serve so it's great.  They also have beers on tap and  wines and they give you a nice selection.  Overall I'm a fan and will keep coming back.  Win win win!",

Great flavor and LOTS of tasty veggies (eggplant, broccoli, peppers, onions, carrots, zucchini) but lacking in noodles.  Still left full and satisfied though.    Was disappointed that they only have bottled teas/juices and no soda (Scottsdale location has a soda fountain).  I'm not even that big on soda, but I have one Diet Coke with my lunch each day so if it's not available - or heaven forbid, Pepsi products only - then I get disappointed.

    "text": "Wait, did Green open up another restaurant in Phoenix?  Like many of you, I was overjoyed to utter that wholly unexpected turn of events.  Am I in a giant garage?  There's a hangar door for a narrow, long car.  I suspect this set-up works well when it is warm, but not hot, and you want to eat outside.  Or eat on the edge of being outside, but remain inside.  You get to choose how close to being outside you want to be without actually being outside.  The way I see, Green is a great restaurant and it happens to be vegetarian/vegan.  Where Green surpasses other restaurants is flavor.  The salad, the most neglected item on every other menu-- flavorful.  Other menu items -- flavorful.  Did I mention that I like meat?  If you are answering, \"no?\", then you need to read some of my other reviews.  And feel free to endorse them as funny or cool.  The answer is yes, people.  The reason I like Green is because what I like even more is good food.  This incarnation of Green has an artsy (in a good way), trendy, causal kind of feel.  There's folksy art on the walls available for purchase, and am in a hangar for mini airplanes?  There's also the companion coffee-dessert shop next door, called Nami.  It is where you get the Tsoynami.  If you don't know what that is, maybe it's time to find out.",

My friend had a calexico which had a nice hummus/sauce mixture, but was otherwise pretty boring. I don't know....feel like burgers should have some form of veggies like lettuce, tomatoes, etc. Another friend had the thai peanut bowl. The tofu was pretty good but that sauce was so thick and heavy. I'm curious to try other options and check out Nami, but they've got some work to do to impress me foodwise.",

I don't typically like when vegan/vegetarian foods try to be like meat, but they did a fantastic job. The wings had a great sauce and the burger was a dressed up vegetarian burger.

The fries were a wee bit cold, but still tasty and I didn't want to wait for a refire. I learned there was fairly new staff on board and that's such a small detail that it's forgiven. I know if I asked, they would have happily remade them! The Spicy Po' Boy was good and messy!! Their wing sauce is my favorite, I probably won't order that sandwich again, just too messy for me. I prefer their Bufalo wings anyway (eaten with a fork)! My standard order includes the wings, definitely what made me fall in love with Green. The Sangria was large, slightly dry, not uber sweet, and had peach slices! They have other cocktails beside wine and beer, but I wouldn't expect a full bar. However, the cooler full of non-alcoholic bevs holds quite the variety!   The Scottsdale location sells the tsoynami desserts inside, along with the full menu, while the Phoenix location shares a lot with Nami. Nami is the stand alone coffee shop where you'll find all the vegan desserts!   Great vegan fast food, there are healthy options, but who wants that when you can get a Big Wac?!   There's lots of indoor AND outdoor seating, the art lining the walls is local and can be purchased, it's counter service where they deliver to the table, booze, and desserts next door. Keep in mind that parking is limited and have patience with the parking lot, it's worth it!",

From the cool laid back bohemian-hipster atmosphere, to the friendly staff and great selection of eats, this place is off the charts.   A lot of restaurants really try at this, and the bar was set high from living in Austin, and having a lot of that culture within an arms length, we were spoiled. However, I am looking forward to my next road trip just so I can try new things and eat great food while on the road.   Locals you are truly gifted a wonderful vegan eat spot! Try the buffalo \"wings\" - they are incredible!",

I adore the plant based food (being lactose intolerant, it's often difficult to find cheat day like food when the craving hits) and the delicious dessert shop right next door.   What I don't love?   The parking.   Almost every time i've gone, i've almost narrowly missed hitting someone who is backing up out of a spot or the tiny parking lot is cramped by mid day and you're circling around like a chicken with their head cut off to find a rare open spot.   I get the exclusivity of this place but go here on the off hours or lyft to get something to eat (I'm not kidding)",

As a vegetarian, I already eat pretty healthy so this place is always a treat for me.  I would avoid the obvious lunch and dinner hours because this place is very popular. Also the parking lot can fill up pretty quickly so plan the timing of your visit accordingly.  I don't really care for the salads here but I compare every veggie burger I eat anywhere to the outstanding BIG WAC (a vegetarian Big Mac) and I also love the buffalo wings, crab rangoons, and occasionally I get the tahini cole slaw. The same owners own Nami next door so on the rare occasion that I still have room in my belly for more, I'll get a s'mores tsunami from Nami as well.",

I'm almost 99.9% sure you guys took your BEST cook and put them in the Scottsdale location, because last time I went there the food was ON point, how your guys's USED to be..and I'm really disappointed..when you pay extra to get gluten free bun, then the burger comes with NO sauce and VERY tiny amount of cheese..almost a PLAIN burger for the most expensive one? What are you giving your customers? What they paid for?? NO. After going to fast food vegan restaurants in Cali, I really hope they come out here because they're gonna take away all your business. They are cheaper and 100% more flavorful and healthier as well! I honestly will eat at home from now on. Much rather make something BOMB, healthier and less expensive than that CRAP food. Not even sorry, that's just the honest truth. Thanks for being as good as you could be? LOL",

    "text": "Pleasantly surprised with this place. Went here for the first time some weeks ago and went again today. Both times I got the Big Wac which seems to be their most popular item. I mean, I'd planned to try something different but after poring over the menu I just couldn't pass up the Wac again, as many of the other dishes sounded spicy and I didn't particularly want a spicy meal today for reasons I'll keep to myself :-)  People-watching while waiting for the food to be delivered was interesting. This place definitely has a certain type of clientele. Flesh-colored yoga pants, tree-hugger sandals, tattoos even shittier than those you might see at Pita Jungle (which is definitely saying something), the rogue's gallery of patrons brought a wan smile to my face at least once a minute until lunch was served.  The burger itself is surprisingly tasty. They lay on the pickles pretty thick, and it doesn't have much cheese or ANY tomato, but even so it was soft and delish. The fries were meh. They call them thyme fries, but I pretty much didn't see any thyme on them - maybe a few microscopic dots of green? But for the most part, just regular shoestring fries, maybe a bit drier than normal, and far from the best fries I've ever had.  Great thing about the meal is that you somehow don't feel shitty afterward. After a regular Big Mac I'm filled with self-loathing. An hour after my Big Wac I was happily enjoying an afternoon coffee and feeling pretty good.  If I could suggest one thing, it would be for these guys to pick different names for their menu items. Fun to read at first, but if McDonalds, Wendy's etc (they also have an item called \"Wendy's Pickle\") catch wind of their trademarks being used like this it could spell big trouble real quick. Maccas probably have more lawyers than employees! One whopper of a law suit (see what I did there?) could probably take this joint down. Plus it's difficult to say \"I'll have a big WAC please\" at the front counter without breaking out into a shit-eating puerile grin. Oh, and another suggestion - arrange more parking space. The parking SUCKS. Assholes parking on the left and right of the place make it almost impossible to manoeuvre anything bigger than a VW beetle around and out again. Good luck with your F150s, nouveau cuisine gourmands..  Also, fix the fries. They're not worth the money you're charging for them.  That all being said, I'll definitely be back! And MAYBE I'll try a new menu item next time round.",

This last time was just unfortunate, we put in an order to go, go out to use the facilities. Come back and wait for our food. We begin to notice how people who came in after us were getting their food so we made a comment about that to the person we ordered with. She looked at us blankly went back into the kitchen and proceeded to run out food. 20 min goes by, nothing. 30 min goes by, nothing. She walks right by us a numerous amount of times so we decide to say something.  They found our food and say, \"we called your name out 20 min ago.\" Hands us our now cold food and sends us on our way. Wow! What service?!? I wish there was an \"I apologize we were really busy and didn't notice that you've been sitting right in front of us for 30 min\" instead we were made to feel like it was our fault and sent on our way. A little disheartening for someone who goes out of their way from a different city to visit.   ProTip: They are not paying attention to detail, so if your food takes longer then 5-10min say something otherwise your food will be cold.",

The last 4 times have included a rude ignorance from staff regarding my autistic son and recently his service dog.  Each time I come with my son to get an ice cream we bring his dog, which has his service tag, but on the last trip it was left at home.  The staff immediately question me on dog's validity to which i assured and demonstrated his action with my son.  Today we entered Green. Asked the same question about the dog. Order ice cream & sat down.  This time my son had his favorite cereal in a snack bag which he likes to add to ice cream.  NO one else was there besides staff, every table empty except for the one table where a male worker finished wrapping napkins.  He got up and came over to my table to recite the prohibition for outside food in the establishment and requested that we leave.  I explained to him my son has allergies on top of everything else and would be done in a few moments.   Worker insisted and walked over to the front door, opened it and pointed both to the message on the door and to the street.  I gathered up my son, dog, ice cream.  Walked over to the register and reached in to  jar to remove my tip.    Told him the owners should be proud of the depth to which rules are enforced with an empty room and empty parking lot.  And to go F... himself...",

It came highly recommended so maybe it's just me. Ranchero salad was delicious as usual. Very happy that all of our food (for our family of 5) came out at the same time. I can't remember the last time that happened at Green and that was always frustrating. Sometimes someone would be done with their meal before the rest of the food came out. Hopefully they've fixed that for good. Finished with tsoynamis next door at Nami of course. Yum.",

Decided on the BBQ chick'n, crab puffs and the boyfriend had the Big WAC.   Restaurant was clean and fun, outdoor seating was lovely. The cashier was super friendly and helpful as we were trying to pick some lunch items. I would recommend Green highly, and would be there weekly if I was a resident. I can't think of anything that could improve it!",

I ordered the Buffalo Wing ($5.50), Sesame Dragon Rice Bowl with mock chicken ($9.75), The BFF $8.75), and Big WAC ($8.50).   From the reading the Yelp reviews, I was most excited to try the Big WAC, but it was salty vegan patties with burnt bread. It does taste similar to a McDonald's Big Mac and like a Big Mac it was lacking. I would also skip the Buffalo Wings as well.   The two dishes I did enjoy were has mock chicken as the main protein - The BFF and rice bowl. After trying The BFF, I got one to-go for my girlfriend and she did not even know that it was fake fried chicken. I would try Green New American Vegetarian again for their other mock chicken sandwiches.  What I recommend: -- The BFF",

I'm vegetarian so hands down it's one of my favorite restaurants in the valley.   The food is great. It's truly a vegan/vegetarians dream - comfort food, vegan style! And although it's vegan it still taste amazing! So flavorful!  Recently they changed their menu up, which I'm pretty bummed about. The sandwiches no longer come with a side and they changed a few sandwiches and got rid of one of my favorites - the No Harm Chicken Parm :( whyyyy!?  Although, they did add a new sandwich, the BFF. Let me just say, it makes up for my old fav. The BFF is a mock chicken sandwich and it is so good. The mock chicken breading was crunchy and crispy. There's avocado on it. I subbed the jalapenos for Cholula hot sauce. And then there ranch sauce. Ahhh, I'm getting hungry thinking about it! That along with the chili cheese fries and I'm in heaven.   Another bad change, the kids meals. They now include a side and the price went way up. $8 for the mock chicken nuggets and $9 for a plain veggie burger...you gotta be kidding me! Although, I still bought it for my little ones lol.  What can I say, I'll always love this place.",

After waiting 30 minutes (plus 15-20 in line to place the order) I finally just asked for my money back.  I was never rude and I did not raise my voice or show any signs of agitation. But all I got after waiting nearly an hour was sarcasm and an attitude. They did not offer to comp the food, nor did they even bother to offer an apology. All they said was that they \"simply forgot\" and I would be refunded in \"about 3-4 business days.\" That's an hour of my life I will never get back.  It's the second time something like this has happened to me here, but I figured I'd give them another shot, and that was a mistake.  There are other vegetarian options in the Phoenix area, and I highly recommend taking your hard earned money elsewhere. It will be the best advice you will ever get on here.",

I have a moderate spice tolerance - I like some, but I don't have a taste for really extreme heat - and it felt just right to me, and not a bad size for having been listed as just a side instead of an entree.   This location is also very close to a bus stop, and that line allows several easy transfers to the light rail system, so it's easy to access by public transportation.   It also has a little bit of seating outside in both the front and back, and is right next door to another vegan business, which is either great planning or a happy coincidence.   I really liked both of them. I think if I lived in the area I'd probably prefer the Tempe/Scottsdale location just because it has a bigger parking lot, a little more space, and more natural light but this one is still pretty good, and I look forward to trying more of its foods in the future if I'm ever back.",

If you prefer Middle Eastern, Indian, or \"hippie\" vegetarian/vegan, you will probably not like Green too much as their menu is largely vegan-ized items (they use mock meats and cheeses to create burgers, chicken wings, and the like) with heavy use of salty sauces, vegan mayo, and deep frying.  The service and atmosphere are decent for any fast casual eatery and the place is clean as a can be. I've been many times, but the time between my visits is increasing each time.  Please don't mistake the the words \"vegan\", \"organic\", \"natural\", etc. for \"healthy\". Green certainly has healthy items on their menu, but they also have tons of deep fried choices and something like half their menu is slathered in a rainbow of salty sauces.",

A few years ago I was a regular & came on a weekly basis but then my lifestyle diet became more strict when I eliminated the \"comfort food\" that I craved, dropped sugar, & increased my workouts. I decided to go today b/c I've been sick w/ the flu & this is my third week not being active so I guess my body needed that \"comfort food\" satisfaction. I went to Green and had a salad, & for that comfort food cravings, I had the crab puffs. The salad was good & so were the crab puffs, of course the post meal feeling has me feeling tiered, which I am not used to but the food definitely hit the spot for the time being since I've been having that naughty food craving. Although I don't plan to return for a long time, maybe when that craving hits again, I still want to give Green 5 stars for being vegan, using organic ingredients whenever possible, & my salad seemed like a quality salad, so why not. It's great that Green is able to introduce vegan foods to non-vegans whose mind may not have been open to trying vegan food, that alone deserves 5 stars.",

She refused to talk to me about it, saying it was secret. Shocked, I stated that businesses really should disclose that type of info without hesitation, and she said \"no, they don't and aren't going to.\" I thought she was very hostile even though I was just curious. It's not like I was going to try and steal their recipes!  Staff should be friendly and understanding about questions, its what makes customers trust and support their efforts.",

The vegan meat patties are so thin I kept asking \"where's the beef?\" After a couple of bites the meat patties mushed up and turned into the consistency of humus. Way too much bread, it's all bread. The thyme fries had no thyme whatsoever that I could see or taste. For $12.50 (burger alone is $9.75 and you have to pay $2.75 for fries) I expected more. There are many other vegetarian restaurants in town that serve tastier and healthier food. I admire the vegan focus but the execution isn't there.  If I can make better vegan meat and vegan food at home, there's not much reason to eat at this place.",

    "text": "This Green location is an expansion of their Tempe location. Sometimes when establishments do good and grow, one or some of their locations suffer. Not here. You get the same great food that you've come to expect from Green. And in an ingenious business strategy, they'll offer different specials at each one.    For the sake of not being completely redundant, I'll just sum up my favorite dishes.   Vegan comfort food: Big Wac (simply amazing; that is all)  Wendy Pickle (awesome!)  Original G Spicy Chicken & the Argentine po'boys (both equally yum!)   BBQ Chicken or the BBBQ Burger (BBQ is on point!)   All of the burgers & sandwiches come with a side of your choice of fruit, thyme fries, or a Tahini coleslaw. (99% of the time, I choose their fries because they're SO good!)  Feeling light? Jerk Salad w/ their succulent & perfectly seasoned mock chicken instead of tofu. The jungle dressing is delicious!   Ranchero Salad, which comes with BBQ \"chicken\" & their homemade ranch. I hated ranch when I was omni, but I like their vegan ranch.   Both of my fav aforementioned salads come with a spinach + dark medley salad mix (no icebergs here!), shredded carrots, & tortilla strips. You may opt for a 1/2 or full sized salad ($6 vs $9). I usually get the full and eat the 2nd 1/2 another day. Just remove the mock meat, heat, & replace on salad. Unless you remove the tortilla strips prior to refrigerating your leftovers, those will be annoyingly non-crunchy the next day.   This location has liquor options for all of my beer guzzling and mimosa-loving lushes. (Which is ALL of my friends.) I don't drink, so I am unable to assist in that area, except to say that they have drink specials sometimes.   Speaking of... This location implemented it's first happy hour this summer. It's not every day or every Friday, so I suggest stalking, er, following Green on Twitter, ig, & FB for the fastest updates & news.  Happy Hour specials have included delights such as Sloppy Jose's (sic) sliders, Buffalo Cauliflower bites, Roasted Brussels, & Garlic Potato tacos. All beyond amazing for my taste buds. (Happy hour prices extend to certain alcoholic drinks as well.) HH has only been at this location, so far.   Live music sometimes.   Nice and clean inside. Pay at the counter, take a number, & they'll bring your food to your table.  If you prefer fresh air, there are a handful of tables outside.    The restrooms are outside of the building. I am extremely OCD & shuttered at the thought. But when I was finally forced to utilize the facilities, let me tell you! That has to be the nice & cleanest little \"outhouse\" in the history of outhouses. I was very pleasantly surprised!   It shares a parking lot with its sister store, Nami. It's a small lot & it fills quickly during lunch & dinner times. If you're going for lunch, M-F, I suggest arriving no later than 11:30am, to beat the lunch crowd.   One of my favorite restaurants in the valley!",

Glad it's not limited to rice and noodle bowls anymore but VERY sad they got rid of the noodles option!  I was so disappointed that I almost didn't know what to order.  Once I chose and tasted, I forgot about those noodles.  I can't recall the cool name of the salad but it was tons of hearty fried Brussels sprouts in jerk spices atop deep green kale glistening in a thin layer of oil (possibly slightly cooked?) with spring mix, shredded carrots, tortilla chip strips, and a \"jungle dressing\" that had a creamy orange color and amazing taste.  I was hesitant that the salad without any meat or mock meat would be filling enough so I ordered a side of thyme fries.  The salad ended up being sooooo substantial that I was stuffed and could barely eat any fries.  Fries were only okay...missing some magic.  I cannot stop thinking about how delicious, crunchy, green, and flavorful that salad was!  I will be coming back more often and next time I'm getting the same salad with their awesome mock chicken added to it!",

I have only positive things to say about the food and the ataff.  The only real drawbacks for me are the parking situation (not many spots and kind of a pain to navigate when it's full), and prices.  I can't really complain because a good product and service is worth appropriate compensation (and this definitely is).  I just don't earn enough to really be a regular, if that makes sense.  Overall, I definitely recommend Green (either location), but if you come be prepared to drop a decent chunk of change, and maybe ride share if you're coming with friends",

For me the mock chicken tastes more like spare ribs with the barbecue sauce and onions all over it.    It's also a fashion statement. If you can eat this and not get any on your clothes, it means once you picked it up you didn't set it down and you made your way through every bite (and the sandwich could be a meal in itself) without getting barbecue sauce all over everything around you -- except maybe your face and hands.

I heard their burgers and wings are the bomb too. You order at the counter, get a number and pick your own seat. Then, they bring our your food when it's ready! They have sitting indoors and outdoors. They also serve alcohol! On Sundays they are not open but next door Nami's is open for brunch. You can order your food at Nami's then head over here to grab a bloody mary or a mimosa. Bathrooms outside. Friendly staff. Food came out quick. VERY SMALL parking lot.",

Selby's here in Minneapolis, I knew when I went down to Phoenix to visit my parents I had to try their predecessor Green New American Vegetarian. I got the Classic Burger without cheese and the buffalo wings, both of which were surprisingly cheaper than back home at J. Selby's.  The burger was good, but average. I could tell it was a veggie burger unlike the Solo burger at J. Selby's where I couldn't tell at all. The burger was very reminiscent of a Boca burger in my opinion. The wings however, oh my GOD! I could have eaten five orders of those alone! They are easily the best vegan wings I've ever had and I still have cravings for them. I just wish they could tell me how they make their wings so yummy. I wish J. Selby's would forgo their cauliflower based wings for these. But then again maybe not as I would never leave. LOL.",

I ended up with the BFF, which is a mock chicken sandwich with cheese, jalapenos, and ranch, all vegan. It was incredible. The meal was a little pricey because fries were extra, but it was well worth it. (I am confused why they were called thyme fries, too, as they didn't appear to have thyme on them.) Having read other reviews, I plan to return to try to Wac Burger. My mouth is just watering remembering my time at Green. Mmm...",

This place is always packed and it's because it's easy to see that people are discovering that the food and atmosphere here is awesome. They have so many wonderful options. If you are in the mood for a nice veggie bowl they have that. But why not try the the burger (big wac) options or the spicy chicken sandwich. I was in phx for two days and i went both days i had too. The spicy chicken sandwich was great and probably the vegan thing I've ever had. The fried brussel sprouts were so good and crunchy. The next day I had the big wac and it's a really good burger with a lot of flavor.  My lady had the tofo curry bowl and it was a lot of food.  The portions are great the staff is fun and this place is the perfect place specially for a bite to eat, everyone should try it not just vegans.",

I'm a pretty tough critic in the realm of fake meats and substitutes, as the flavor and taste was never my reason for giving up meat.   My boyfriend and I came here a few days ago and shared wings, crab puffs and a big Wac. The big wac was by far the best hamburger I've ever had in my life. It was exactly how I remember a Big Mac tasting, yet somehow even better. The crab puffs were delicious, but I didn't notice much fake crab meat. They seemed to be mostly cream cheese. The buffalo wings were also very good, but definitely an obvious fake meat. I don't think many meat eaters would appreciate them, but I loved them. The sauce is so good, I want it bottled.   I fell in love so hard with this place, that I think we're going back for dinner tonight.",

To be fair, this location doesn't have the super-customized hipster vibes of the original Green, as in, there aren't painted car doors lining the walls, but it offers the same great food in a metropolitan area. Plus, Nami is right next door, which is essentially a fat, animal-loving kid's heaven.  Currently, my nom of choice is the orecchiette with mock meatballs. If you're missing meat, or need to convince some judgmental bacon-lover that vegan food isn't a leaf on a piece of tofu, order this. Delicious, savory meatballs, smothered in cheese and marinara over veggies and pasta? Hardly part of an ascetic lifestyle. Oh, and it's eight bucks. Double awesome.

I recommend peanut butter with double chick-o-sticks.  The actual restaurant is super clean, modern, and fresh. The front is a glass garage door that when the weather allows, will open to a patio.

    "text": "This is my favorite restaurant by far! Being a vegan it is hard to find a place that will have options for me that isn't just a salad and that will actually fill me up. Green is always delicious and I feel like I ate a great meal after leaving!  Not only is the food great but the customer service is as well. I have only once had a cashier that was not 100% pleasant and helpful, and I have been here many times! I have taken meat eaters here and there are no complaints. The first time eating at Green was weird because the mock chicken was almost too realistic, the texture is phenomenal!   One warning I will give is that if you are allergic to soy, this is not your place. Every meal has a soy element (tofu, soy milk, etc.), so if you can not consume soy you have to ask for the meal without some of the key ingredients.   I have a sister who is vegetarian and although we are both about a half hour drive from Green we try to eat there as often as we can. Its that good! To add her two cents, she is very picky about mock meats. Every other vegan/vegetarian place we have tried has her saying \"I don't like this as much as Green.\"  My favorites are the Original \"G\" Spicy Po Boy, the Big Wac, and the Crab Puffs. My mom is a big fan of the Black Jack Pita as well! And although their coleslaw is great, I think the thyme fries are some of the best fries I have ever had!  Gluten free? No problem! There is a whole menu of items that are already or can be made gluten free. Counting calories? There are lots of delicious salads! Want to stuff your face full of delicious fried awesomeness? You have come to the right place!  I HIGHLY recommend Green to vegans, vegetarians, and omnivores alike!",

My loss of star comes in because of the menu.  There are some GREAT menu items, but unfortunately, the descriptions are seriously lacking. I ordered a \"creamy\" artichoke dip, which led me to think I was getting an Italian-inspired creamy artichoke dip. But what I got instead was an Asian-spiced watery artichoke dip that did not even try to be creamy. It was more like a spicy soup.   The spicy soup was good, but it wasn't what I expected, and certainly not what was described on the menu. It's all about consistency, and unfortunately, they didn't deliver in this area. But, nonetheless, I will come back because the food is great!",

However, I've been sick for three days after eating there. I ordered everything off the gf menu but still had a reaction. I was a little worried when my chili came out with fried chips on top, but I double checked with the employee who gave it to me. He double checked with the kitchen, so I thought I was fine. Nope. So either the chili is a problem or the banana cream pie soynami (with gf options) from Nami next door. I almost brought one of my children, who has an even more severe reaction to gluten, with me. That would have been a disaster!",

She snapped and said that it was coming. Then she proceeded to serve three other tables. Five more minutes went by and they went back up there to ask again about their food. Once again, she snapped and said it was coming. Obviously it wasn't. At this point half of our group lost their appetite and did not finish their meal. After waiting for five more minutes, for a total of 20 minutes after the rest of the table had been served, we asked for a refund of the one plate. This was a $70 tab we will never get back and are very upset by one employee's attitude. She ruined our meal and did nothing but stare as one person in our party complained about her attitude. If there was an issue in the kitchen, she should have said that. Aside from the incredibly rude employee, the food was just okay. My burger bun was burnt and that is all I could taste. This was my first time and I will never return. The people with me have been here before many times, but they decided they would not ever return. It was a waste of time and money. She completely ruined our evening.",

For me it's hard to find place to eat thats vegan/vegetarian and accommodating to wheat, corn, and soy allergies. So when asked for gluten free option they told me everything is on a shared grill. Now to me that's not gluten free, they are cross contaminating their food. I break out in hives eating any of these ingredients. Also, the little chips that you ask for the gluten free option they give you corn chips. So I didn't really eat my salad. Kind of a disappointment. So if you have food allergies I would suggest not eating there because of the shared grill of all their food. Too bad.",

While I like the quality of the food equally in both, I prefer the restaurant in Phoenix. But, the parking is a dream in Tempe compared to the lack of spaces in Phoenix.   I truly believe someone made a pact with the devil to come up with the Big Wac. As a vegetarian, I do not miss McDonald's, but this burger tastes better to me than I remember the Big Mac or any McDonald's burger tasting. It does this while magically capturing what is best about McDonald's burgers' dressings. The thyme fries are a prefect accompaniment.  My wife adores the O.G. Po' Boy. She says it is the best spicy, tangy buffalo \"chicken\" sandwich she has ever eaten. It's dressed with baby greens and we fight over the thyme fries everything comes with. They're worth fighting over.   It is worth a hassle, any wait, or even ordering it to go through their fantastic app.",

I didn't post a review after that experience, but felt this warranted one.  I ordered the BFF and a side of fries on the advice of one of the staff members.  But after waiting 25 minutes for the food and watching a number of people who ordered after me receive their meal, I said that I wanted a refund.  A different staff member went into the kitchen, clearly couldn't find my ticket, and asked one of the kitchen staff if they had my ticket.  I could hear the kitchen staff say they did not.  When the same staff member returned to me, I asked her if the kitchen had even started preparing my food.  She stated, \"They are cooking it, but we'll be able to cancel it.\"  At this point, after being lied to, I realized that I don't need to support this business.  Like the lack of courtesy given me about the status of the food prep, the refund process was just as lackluster.  After offering a gift card in the amount that I paid (because that's exactly what a customer wants from a business they don't like), I waited another ten minutes while two different staff members tried to figure out their point-of-sale system.  Ultimately, they couldn't figure it out and just handed me my money back while scribbling what they had done on a piece of paper to jog their memory later.  I guess the best thing I can say for Green is that, while they wasted 35 minutes during my lunch hour and made me late for my next meeting, I saved $8 by quickly buying and eating a sandwich from Walgreen's.  Maybe not as tasty, but then again, I've never eaten the BFF since Green failed to even let me try it.",

Ok....well at least they are fast right? WRONG. Waited another 15-20 minutes for my take out order to be completed. The vibe felt very new age/alternative and I definitely feel like my guest and I were overlooked due to our appearance.  Golf clothes are apparently not the preferred dress code. Overall this was a lackluster experience and the service really puts a nail in the coffin. Hard pass on trying again.",

It is as good (and better than some) as the vegan food here in LA and much cheaper. I started with the crab puffs which were basically the vegan version of crab rangoon. I used to love crab rangoon before I became vegetarian 15+ years ago and haven't had it since, so this was a treat. I honestly couldn't tell it was vegan. The cream cheese and fake crab was perfect. I also got the big WAC which is their vegan version of a big mac. This was one of the best veggie burgers I've had. It tasted just like what I have always imagined a big mac tastes like (I've never actually eaten one). It was also a huge burger and under $10. I will definitely be back next time I am in Phoenix. Plus there is a vegan bakery next store",

The first time was at Nami, a woman was simply confused of the pricing because I guess she was in there prior, ordered the same thing and it was less. She was very calm, and the manager was really snobby and kept bickering with her. It was really embarrassing for both the customer and the establishment. The second time we came in today, my friend tried to order the same salad she always had to find out you guys changed the menu..The pricing had gone up and now there was no chicken...no big deal, but she wanted something taken out of it. The manager brought he salad back and was just like \"can I just bring you a plate and you just pull out whatever you don't want?\" It was pretty inconsiderate and having been a manager myself for 6 years at a staple AZ restaurant, I know this was probably not the best way to approach the situation. Shouldn't you be offering your customers good food AND friendly service? I would hate for green to get pretentious.",

    "text": "After having visited the Tempe location, I was excited to try the restaurant downtown.  This space is so much more urban chic, with clean, open decor.  It is much more my style than the other location!  I arrived right as the restaurant opened, daughter in tow.  We quickly perused the menu and decided to order the hummus plate and the drunken mushroom chicken bowl.  We also ordered a couple fountain drinks and filled up with some organic berry lemonade.    We were served the hummus quickly by Chef Damon (though we did not introduce ourselves).  It was spicy and I loved it, but it had too much of a bite for my daughter.    The bowl came out quickly, and my daughter and I shared and devoured the entire bowl.    We chatted a bit with Chef Damon, who told us they were introducing a kids' menu in the next couple weeks.  It will have things like Mac N Cheese and Burgers.  I told him my kid loves the rice noodles, etc.  I really hope they offer kid sized portions of some of their milder flavored bowls.    Overall, I LOVE Green!  My daughter loved it, too.  She asked me if we can go there every week when we are downtown for her appointment.  That's even without making a trip to Nami, which we plan to do next week.  The employees at this location are on point and are very friendly and helpful.    My daughter loved the music and chose to dance a bit while the restaurant was still empty.  Hey - she wasn't bugging anyone!  Who can resist world music?!  Here's to continued growth and success of a fabulous restaurant.",

First of all, vegan soft serve - I had the \"Betterfinger\" with chik-o-stick candy and chocolate chips, yum.  Also tried the Wendy's chicken sandwich with their fries and that was delicious too! The atmosphere was great, the staff was really friendly and it hits all those vegan cravings!",

I had planned on going to the restaurant but had mostly forgotten about it until recently when a friend of mine had a birthday party there.  I was so impressed! Everything was delicious. I had a little bit of everything at the table and enjoyed it all. I ordered a Po Boy sandwich for myself. It was tremendous! A little spice on the previously mentioned chicken wings.   They had some truly stand out hummus. Absolutely incredible chili fries...I'm going back soon. So good!",

    "text": "So, I must admit that when I walked into this restaurant I did not really know what I was doing. As a recently minted Vegan my friends have been telling me to try this place. Figuring from their name, they'd have vegan options or at least items you could modify to be vegan. Upon looking at the menu the \"Big Mac\" grabbed my attention. It mentioned that it was a vegan burger but had cheese. \"Why would they do this?\" I asked my friend. \"Why would they put cheese on a Vegan burger and make it un-vegan? Why even bother making the burger vegan then?\" I queried. She then pointed to a section on the menu that described the restaurant. Much to my surprise, Green is a 100% vegan restaurant!  Now, I didn't know what to get because everything sounded good, being Vegan. The waitress suggested we get the special they were offering that night, which they were doing for NYE 2013. The special included hot & sour soup, \"egg\" rolls, vegan crab puffs, BBQ \"chicken\" skewers, some baby bok choy, and some sort of vegan duck dish. I have never had duck so I have no basis for comparison. I must say, everything was absolutely delicious! The vegan crab puffs...I can't get over how good those were.  They also have really unique drinks and they do offer beer and wine.   I will definitely be back to this restaurant or their Tempe location.",

I am Asian that grew up on home-made Asian Foods, so I don't think their Asian bowls are that good. I use to get them and I would ask for less sauce or sodium because I thought it was a bit salty. Besides that, I love their food.   I love the thought and design. I always think of inviting friends because it is so cool inside. I love how the artwork changes all the time. This place really makes vegan food appealing to those that are spectacle to the idea of vegan food.   I am thankful that they are closer to me now since I live in North Phoenix!

It was hard to pick what to order on the menu because I wanted like 5 things. I ended up deciding on the Thai Peanut Bowl with soy chicken. It was absolutely amazing. The vegetables were very fresh and a bit al dente. I loved the soy chicken. And the peanut sauce was the perfect medium level of spiciness. My companion had the Coconut Curry Bowl with soy chicken and also loved hers. She asked me after we left if I would come back to Phoenix just to eat there. I said I wasn't sure but you wouldn't have to pressure  me too hard to take another trip to Phoenix. She (a non-vegan) also said she wished we had Green in Portland and said it was the best vegan restaurant she'd been to. Anyway, I need to get busy planning my next vacation to Phoenix for about 7 days so I can try everything I want! Or Green could always open a location in Portland. You'd be much loved here.",

They warned me about fried items in a shared frier (fries and sweet potato tots), but anything on the gf menu would be fine.

Ordered buffalo wings and artichoke dip for appetizers, and they were so delicious, I was so happy, and thought things would be okay.   Then my jerk tofu salad comes out and the tofu looks suspiciously deep fried. I get up to ask, and sure enough, they deep fried my glutenfree tofu. I said I can't eat it, because I have celiac disease. She asked if they could just remove the cc'd tofu off the top and offered raw tofu in its place. No, that's not how celiac disease works. You have to remake it.   Since she was so ill informed, I decided to ask about the wings and dip. Turns out the wings and corn chips are also fried in dirty oil... Even though they were on the gf menu. When I pointed that out, she said \"well we SAY we can't guarantee there's no cross contamination.\" ...that's different than knowingly bathing all the gluten free menu items in gluten, lady. (The menu didn't state that these items were deep fried, and I figured the corn chips were store bought, so I didn't ask. Stupid me for assuming they had a clue. That shiny fancy gluten free menu was just so distractingly beautiful....)  She tried to make me pay for the remade salad, but after I said I didn't want to pay since I'd just bought a ton of food that 2/3 of our party couldn't eat even though it was on the gf menu, she comped the salad. I should have just walked out then and there, but didn't want to ruin my companion's meals. My spouse eats glutenfree so he doesn't make me sick, so any minimal contamination wouldn't harm him, thankfully.   I'm angry that their employees are so ill informed, but I'm absolutely disgusted and infuriated that the owner(s) went to the trouble of printing gf menus and pretending like they can cater to gf customers while not actually caring about the ramifications of their dishonesty and ignorance.   If you're a gluten free fad dieter, you'll have fun here pretending like you're being glutenfree because you're doing it to be trendy. But if you have celiac disease or gluten intolerance, don't bother giving these people your money.  I don't expect perfection when I eat out as a person with celiac disease. But I do expect honesty and an honest effort to minimize contamination. Neither happened, and now I am incredibly sick. Shame on you, Green. Shame on you.",

It has simple,  straightforward vegan options for food you'd usually get from the drive thru or Chinese take-out,  kinda. I thought the food was good especially for people looking for vegan alternatives. It was not great only because it tasted like regular fast food. I was just surprised the flavors weren't more developed and taken a step further.  I wasn't expecting that. I got take out (spicy po' bo and classic burger) & my car smelled like a burger king and it tasted like a whopper lol..  Not saying it's a bad thing, but since being vegan I haven't really looking for things to put me in mood of eating McDonald's or burger king. I think if I order something different my opinion will change.  We'll see!",

    "text": "True, I've had more adventurous plant-based, vegan food in a lot of cities (LA, Portland, Seattle, for example), but I think Green does a really nice job with quality, service, and an affordable, approachable menu. I am so grateful to have an option like this in a food scene dominated by steaks, pizza, and pasta.   We've been twice so far, and both times got the bowls with house tofu, brown rice, and lots of veggies. They come with various sauces and spices, and all we've tried have been excellent. The salad we ordered the first time was a touch too astringent (over-salted, too much vinegar) but otherwise included a solid variety of diverse vegetables. We tried the vegan chili fries the second time, which were pretty tasty, though I generally find that vegan food trying to imitate non-vegan food comes up a little short. We also tried the chocolate tSoynami, which was basically a non-dairy chocolate shake. I'd be interested to see the grams of sugar, but taste and texture were good.   Overall, I'd love to see a few more options on the menu where plants get to be the stars, but I enjoy Green and will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I had only one night in Phoenix to catch up with one of my oldest and dearest friends and based on reviews and the menu, I decided to go to Green Restaurant. Green is a 100% vegan restaurant that features new American-style comfort food. They also try to use organic ingredients when possible. But, it was really the chef's statement on the website that made me want to visit. It is owned by Damon Brasch, a vegan chef and restauranteur who is now living his dream by having opened this restaurant. He wanted to create a menu that would please any palate and that was influenced by many different cultures and cooking styles.  And it was so successful that there are now two locations as well as a separate vegan dessert place called \"Nami.\"  My friend alerted me that it was a very casual place so I was prepared to dine super casual on this Friday night. When we arrived around 8 p.m., it was packed and there was just enough seating for our group so we snagged it right away. We took a look at the menu for a long time. As everything is vegan, it was very difficult for me to choose what I wanted. The menu features appetizers, bowls, salads, sammies & burgers, and sides so there was a lot to choose from.  I was also pleased to see that they served beer and wine as well. Once we made our selections, we ordered at the counter, then sat down and waited for our food.  I started with a locally brewed beer -- Four Peaks Peach Ale. Then, our appetizers started arriving. First, we had the green hummus made of garlic, poblano chilies, and chickpeas with fried pita. This one was a winner.  Next,we had the spicy buffalo wings, which were probably my favorite item from the whole night. They were tender with great spice and served with a delicious vegan cucumber ranch.  Our last appetizer was the samosas filled with curried potatoes, peas, carrots, and garlic served with a tamarind dipping sauce. These were okay, but nothing to write home about.  For my entree, I ordered the Clexico Burger. This was their homemade burger with organic garbanzo hummus, cheddar cheese, mayo, and spicy chipotle sauce. The burgers were a bit too meaty for me and not vegetably enough, if you know what I mean. And there were no veggies -- no lettuce or tomato so it was just a lot of fake meat with a nice chipotle sauce. I thought the burger was good, but definitely not what I should have ordered given the other healthy options.  I ended up wishing I had ordered the Singapore orange bowl that my friend had. Filled with fresh broccoli, zucchini, and faux meat, it was delicious.  Another girl got the Coconut Curry Bowl filled with broccoli, zucchini, and potatoes in a curry sauce.  My out-of-town friends tried their famous version of a Big Mac, the Big WAC! This was way too much burger for me. It was two patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame bun just the way I remembered. I have to admit that it was good, just too meaty and too much.  In the end, I was so glad I chose this place. Though I wish I had ordered the fresh bowls, I was still satisfied with everything I tried and some items were exceptionally good. All of our bowls and sandwiches were about $9 so pretty cheap. And I love that they offer beer, wine, and soft serve ice cream. This place is a win-win.",

So what kept bringing me back?  This place is all vegan and has tons of gluten-free options. They even have a separate gluten free menu that explains what they have and how to order to make sure you get what you want. They even have gluten free beer, and it's only $3. If it's busy, someone will come out to the line and start taking people's orders to move things along more quickly. And the people who work there are super friendly and helpful.  As I said, I went four times, and I ordered something different each time. My favorite was the salad with mock chicken and artichoke hearts. It was so delicious that I wish I could have it at every meal. It was a substantial salad that more than filled me up for lunch for less than $10. I tried a couple of the different po boys - one on a gluten free bun (which I do not recommend - it was kind of dry and tasteless), and one with gluten free tortillas (recommended). You can go to Nami next door for vegan desserts, several of which are gluten free.  I just love that everything is so well marked, and the employees are helpful and understanding. Not having to struggle to find something to order or to get the employees to understand my dietary restrictions was a welcome change. The fact that the food is also quite tasty made it even better.  I would gladly go here every day if there were one near where I live.",

It was simply a matter of choosing the right items. So, stay away from the crab puffs, and you'll be totally fine.   Really looking forward to going back. (And with the next update, I'll make sure it's more timely, and we have the menu items so we can steer you in the right direction.)  Yet another update.

I have been going to the Tempe location since shortly after they opened.  There is no difference in the food from one location to the next.  The only down side is the parking situation at the Phoenix location.  But for this food, I'll drive around the block til a spot opens up, THAT is how good it really is.",

Maybe because its their flagship location?  I'd recommend either location for American style comfort foods with a vegan twist!

As a strict carnivore, I was hesitant to come in. I felt personally attacked when I saw they had all kinds of mock meats. But one bite was all it took to shake and tremble my foundation. Here I sat lost in my identity, but found in the upper heavens of flavor. If we lived 500 years in the past, I'd be writing to the Queen instead of writing this review to accuse the chef of witchcraft, because his skills are nothing short of a wizard's. I immediately had to come out of the closet and tell my bros about my experience. They did not approve. I may have lost my bro card, but oh god was it worth it.

I believe I may have gone in on an off day and it put me off.   I wanted veggies, I saw and I decided to give it a go. Now, I do believe the menu changed since I had gone in so long ago. I went with the artichoke wrap and I was not disappointed in the least!  This thing was massive! It was dressed perfectly with their lemon-tahini dressing so each bite really did have a perfect balance. Artichoke hearts, hearts of palm, kalamata olives, cucumber, tomatoes, greens, just so much deliciousness all wrapped up. I did add mock jerk chicken to it and as I've said in previous posts I'm not a fan of tofu, however the mock chicken was actually a good addition. I was surprised.   When I asked the lady what she would have chosen between (upon being given selections) she was honest and used \"interesting\" to describe the wrap. I was sold on it at that moment. It was interesting and sometimes that can be frightening. Only, this time, I was stoked and will visit again at some point.",

    "text": "This was a nice find on my recent business trip to Phoenix, especially since I've been searching out satisfying vegetarian fare given how I've been attempting to turn a nutritional leaf. Phoenix actually has quite a few excellent vegan and vegetarian-friendly restaurants from the original True Food Kitchen (review: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2BT7Zqn&s=4849d50d24631d8df525bc9cc6323edca30f28fa9cc8e66e247618aba19deac4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2BT7Zqn</a>) to Fresh Mint in Scottsdale (review: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Diq8m4&s=c213da545d0e35ba0255a97343a0e2f26aa7d3ffcb9eaf717bb3586bb7107d07\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2Diq8m4</a>). I can see how a healthier diet could help you cope with all the dry heat down there, and Green appears to be one of the more popular spots down there since cars were circulating the funky-retro building on a regular basis in their futile search for an open parking space.  I was lucky because I got there around 5:30PM having survived not only the rush hour traffic but also Seventh Street's infamous suicide lanes to get there. For a fully vegan menu, the selection was very home-style comfort food but obviously with a meatless twist like the use of grilled seitan for their Chicago Cheesesteak and mock chicken in their BBQ Sammie. I was immediately drawn to the $8.75 Peanut Chicken Salad since I could easily indulge myself in a bowlful of brown rice otherwise. It featured several pieces of mock chicken coated in a crispy texture, mixed greens, cabbage, carrots, green onions, and crushed peanuts.  It was all tossed in a sweet peanut vinaigrette and topped with tortilla chips I probably didn't need (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2EJ518M&s=821e665c7af4247bffe5948a9ab2eb092b3ea89b280e8c8d6167017ac1b2eda2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2EJ518M</a>). It was quite tasty though I assume it was not as low in calories as I was hoping, especially since there was a bit of peanut sauce in the vinaigrette that bordered on decadent. It was truly entree size, but I underestimated the portion (as usual) and ordered a $3.75 bowl of Vegan Chili on the side. This was also topped with plenty of tortilla strips which made me think I ate a bag of Doritos for dinner (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2DCfnbv&s=a4b7e6704c33a066bd99ce4ea1b461e6dd85d7b60158cfe31f25bf63eabbad12\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2DCfnbv</a>). Since a place this organic wouldn't be caught dead with Diet Coke, I took advantage of the bottomless refills of the $2.25 Strawberry Lemonade which lent puckery sweetness to my meal.  FOOD - 4 stars...tasty vegan comfort food that's quite filling AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...funky vibe, nice patio, traffic hell on Seventh to get here SERVICE - 3.5 stars...nice vegans TOTAL - 4 stars...another enticing meatless spot to check out in Phoenix",

All I tasted was salt but the patty's texture was good and the bread fresh.  The tomatoes were fresh and flavorful but the lettuce was watery and felt sparse for such a large sandwich.  The secret sauce was also very sweet and lacked flavorful seasoning besides salt. No sides came with the sandwich this was disappointing.  There is very little parking and the space offered is both tight and odd.  The inside lacks personality and decoration. It's a plain looking tiny shaped space. No nutritional information is offered or known by the employees or offered on the website or menu.  Also, the service was extremely slow it was well over 30 minutes before the food arrived. Unfortunately the overall paid experience was very disappointing.",

I am mostly vegan, sometimes vegetarians and all the way gluten intolerant. I decided on the \"chicken\" nuggets with fries. I chose those items because there was a GF next to them. I confirmed with the cashier that those items are in fact gluten free. No they are not!!! While wheat has not been added to the products, they are cooked in a fryer that has had wheat products in it. Total cross contamination. The \"chicken\" nuggets and thyme fries are totally confusing and should NOT have the GF next to it. I ended up ordering a brown rice bowl with curry veggies. It was good but not at all what I wanted.  Please have 2 fryers in the kitchen, 1 for wheat products and 1 for non wheat products.   For my gluten free friends, please confirm that your dish is in fact gluten free. I would hate for you to get sick.",

They're thin crispy fries smothered in cheese (I think it's daiya) and vegan thousand island dressing. Definitely wanna eat that mess with a fork. It was greasy and rich and delicious.   I got a po boy. It had a perfect amount of spice and the chik'n inside was thin and tender and super delish. It was super messy and got orange spicy sauce all over my hands. The omnivore boyfriend got the BFF. It was spicy. He said the breaded chick'n reminded him a lot of a Chik Fil A type of sandwich. His was even messier than mine and he had to scarf it down because it was falling apart in his hands.   Bus your own table. Be sure to save room for dessert at Nami next door. They have super yummy ice cream but the serving sizes are pretty small for the price.   We'll definitely be coming back to Green. I want to try everything on the menu.",

I must say that I'm really not a big fan of the fake meats or dishes that try to be vegan when they really shouldn't. However, I would say that the stuff that we ordered was really good. We started with the chili fries and these were actually super good. Fries were nice and crispy and the chili not only had flavor of a legit chili but the texture was there too. You have to get a side of the ranch too. My wife and I split the Thai peanut \"chicken\" wrap and it was definitely the best fake meat I had ever tasted. It actually had a good texture and the crunchiness from the peanuts and the sauce all went really well together. Whether you are vegan or not, you will most likely enjoy this place.",

But it's funny that carnivores don't take in meats tasting like vegetables, but the vegans take in foodstuffs tasting like meat. Hmmm....  Squirrel!  Anyways, I was in the vicinity of some green unhealthy new americans and decided to finally try Green restaurant. It's popularity proceeds it and after reading the menu online, there were a couple of dishes I wanted to try.  Mainly the Dagobah. Day-go-wha? Yeah, Dagobah. Actually the full name is Dagobah Jungle ($8.75): jerk spiced fried brussels sprouts over fresh greens tossed in jamaican jungle dressing with carrots and crunchy tortilla strips. That's how I ordered it but the cashier also gave the choice of having it in a burrito.   Daay-oh. Day-ay-ay-oh! Dagobah come and me want to eat it all. It arrived to the table in a large bowl with ample brussels and a decent portion of salad. On first taste of the dressing (I think it was tahini based) the sky must have parted and heavenly light shined down on me. It was delicious and made me forget about the jerk seasoning which was completely AWOL. Too bad, because now that I think about it, spiciness in this dish would have probably sent me UP to heaven.   I also tried the samosas ($6.75): curried potatoes, peas, carrots and fresh garlic wrapped in a thin fried pastry with tamarind dipping sauce, says the menu. Well...four small samosas came on the plate in thick crispy fried dough with - maybe - two cubes of potatoes in each one. Curry? Couldn't taste it. Garlic? Couldn't taste it. Carrots and peas? I'm pretty sure I would have been able to spot them -- if they were there. But they weren't. Did I already say AWOL? i would not order these again.   Oh yeah, I also had the animal fries ($5.75) which are supposed to be potatoes seasoned with thyme and smothered with melted cheese, grilled onions, and 1k island sauce. These were really good, but thyme was not on my side? It was AWOL.  Are you seeing a pattern here?  So, overall, even with all the absent flavors, the dishes were good. Nothing was too oily or over done. Portions were generous, much better than I'm used too. I would like to return and try the Karma Curry,   If I could change only one thing, it would be the onions on the animal fries. Onions flavor was weak and they were chopped very small, almost insignificant. If it wasn't for the sauce I would not have liked them as much.",

They either never tasted a good vegan/vegetarian, or any other decent food, or cannot cook themselves, therefore they like what is being offered there.   I had a bowl of something that had brown rice, overcooked/burned broccoli and undercooked (very hard) slices of carrots. It was extremely salty, and it did not have any particular flavor. It was tasteless, and the saltiness burned my throat, so I took it back to the counter, and they offered to exchange it for something else. What I got back was another bowl with just plain rice, topped with the same burned broccoli and hard carrots. The salty sauce was missing, so it was more palatable. Oh, I forgot that there were three chewy, fried pieces of tofu (\"chicken\") mixed with it. My friends had some other stuff, but they did not finish it either.  In my humble opinion, it is almost an insult to compare that stuff to True vegan cooking. Vegan and vegetarian cuisine is usually delicious, and flavorful. Another observation: The name Green invokes that they might offer some fresh salads, or other green vegetables. Did not see any.  Will never go back, as there are many better choices for a good food around here, but still wonder: Who writes the positive reviews???",

The cheese was both crispy and melty, which made it good to eat. The Big Wac didn't work for me because it actually tasted just like a Big Mac.

My partner and me visited Green's on our way to the mountains (oh, I don't like this name for a restaurant BTW and I don't even care because the food is so delicious).  I got the chicago cheesesteak.  She got the big WAC.  We went back and ordered 4 more meals to take with us on our trip - screw going to the grocery store and cooking stuff over the fire.  As fun as that is, Green's food is so delicious, we weren't interested in anything else or trying to recreate this deliciousness from scratch over a campfire.  I'm so glad we got more to go.  The chicago cheesesteak we roasted over the campfire that night was even better than what I had in the restaurant.    Then on our way back north to Sedona, we went out of our way to go back to Green's and get more food to go.  Honestly, we didn't get enough to go and fought over it several hours later (although I'm not sure there will ever be enough).  I'm stirred up by my experience at Green's.  Their chicago cheesesteak is better than any chicago cheesesteak I ever had back in my meat eating days.  That means there's like 3 million Chicagoan's eating cows in the form of cheesesteaks that aren't even as good as cow free cheesesteaks.  That's just stupid.  It's not worth the cow.    I'm trying to figure out how to get Green's food here in Chicago.  Can I just order it?  Have it frozen and shipped?  Should I open a Green's New American Vegetarian here in Chicago, on my block, so I can eat it whenever I want?  Maybe.  I've been avoiding writing this because now I want a big WAC, a cheesesteak, a karma curry, a peanut chicken... and they are 1,753.2 miles away from me.",

I never in a million years would have thought that I'd actually be reviewing a restaurant that only serves vegetarian/vegan options with such high praises, but here I am.   I love the whole \"comfort food\" thing they're going for. I got some egglessrolls to start and the diablo red bowl. Both were awesome. The atmosphere at this location was also really cool. Super friendly staff that were patient with me.",

For an appetizer I had the buffalo wings and they were a perfect combination of spicy and savory.  I also had the the secret BBQ chicken sandwich and it was probably the best vegetarian chicken sandwich I've ever had. Being from NYC I've been to many vegan/vegetarian restaurants and I can honestly say without any hyperbole that this place is better than any place in NYC.   Do yourself a favor and go to this place now!",

That Nami was so delicious it made the whole meal a real treat.  Thanks to the cooks at Green and the folks at Nami I had a vegan feast fit for a peasant.   Cole slaw, french fries and tasty vegan meats layered between toasted bread of the Mickey sandwich, it was simply good.",

Place is nice and clean so I ordered: * spicy buffalo \"wings \"   * egglessrolls * drunken mushroom chicken The wings made me think of boneless wings at first but I found them oily and slightly mushy.  I could only think of a frozen package of fake chicken that was heated and cut up.  Similar or the same maybe for the fake chicken in the drunken mushroom chicken bowl.  A breaded piece of processed, packaged and frozen fake chicken is all I could think about when eating, so I stopped. The egglessrolls appeared to have also been processed, packaged and frozen then,  deep fried in oil.  I was thinking that they would have been fresh rice paper wrapped.  They were mushy and oily on the inside.  Crispy and oily on the outside. The noodle dish deserved a bigger taste and perhaps a bolder sauce.  The vegetables were cut without care or respect to culinary skills whatsoever, often leaving parts that would have been better off in a stock or trash. I so wish that I would have stayed home and cooked my own meal on this day. I feel like I was at the TGIFridays of vegetarian foods. Thanks for reading!",

My cousin was in town for a conference and she wanted to meet up with me for a meal before heading back to L.A, so we decided to meet at Green and she loved it, she ordered all apps, the buffalo wings, spicy peanut tofu and the crab puffs. I had the Big Wac and my husband had the Alfredo. Everything was flavorful and delicious. No one left food on their plates and we finished our meal with desserts from Nami next door.",

This place is 5 minutes from my work and as a vegetarian, a welcome spot to grab food! (At least it used to be.)  The problem is the \"new\" menu. All my favorites are gone. If I want a bowl, it's no longer available over noodles, only rice. The sides are a la carte and not included with the choices now.   The other reviews of poor service are warranted. It took almost 30 minutes to get my food. The worst part was I saw the expediter eating french fries off the plate of someone's food just before running it out. GROSS!   Time to find a new place for my 'go-to' lunch spot. :-(",

    "text": "So today I tried the downtown location. I'd only been to the Tempe/Scottsdale location before and had really liked it, even though I'm not vegan or vegetarian.   Well, I don't know if it was this location or if the restaurant has changed that much but it really wasn't good. Not at all.   The Green Burger that I'd eaten at the other location was phenomenal. I've lived with vegetarians for years and have tried a lot of vegan and vegetarian food and have never cared much for it (unless I was preparing it) but the Green Burger was amazing.  It was a house ground and packed oats & barley veggie burger with fresh lettuce and tomato, vegan mayo, ketchup and pickles (per the website).   When I tried to order it today, it was no longer on the menu. I was told the menu had recently changed and the patty is now different - even though the Green Burger is still listed as a menu item on the website. This new burger is just awful. It's much smaller and it's soy based and tastes worse than a Boca patty. If I wanted a crappy little frozen soy patty, I wouldn't pay nearly ten dollars for it...   The fries, which were also amazing at the other location were nothing special here either. They are supposed to be seasoned - they are called \"Thyme Fries\" so I expected some, I don't know, thyme?  Nada - no seasoning whatsoever. They were good but just plain old fries.   It wasn't just me. My husband who has 16 years of vegetarian/vegan experience and who really enjoyed the Argentine Po-Boy previously just looked at me and said \"no bueno\".  It was mostly bread with hardly any filling in it.  Much different than the other location.  Between apps, sandwiches and a couple of iced teas, it cost nearly $50 for lunch for my daughter, husband and me.  Totally not worth it.   I'd go to the Tempe/Scottsdale location again if I knew for sure the Green Burger was available, otherwise I can't see myself returning.",

I get the peanut or curry bowl expecting thai food quality, and it's just not that. It's a substitution for real meat and at that they do a decent job, I'm just not into it.",

The food is mostly mock-meat versions of stuff like chicken parmesan, buffalo wings, etc. If you like greasy, fried food with heavy sauces and want to try the vegan version of it, that's what Green is good for. It tastes good, but I don't feel so great afterward.  If you prefer healthy, clean organic food loaded with fresh veggies and minimally-processed, try Chakra 4 or Persian Garden Cafe.",

Not all of us want to feel a smug self righteousness all the time  while we eat raw beets with a side of dirt. Sometimes a Vegan just wants a hamburger. Is that asking to much?! Not anymore.

I must warn you, parking is a bit of a nightmare.  Very limited spots and fills up fast.  Standing in line to order was very disorganized and it took about 25 minutes to get our food.  I can understand waiting that long if you have a sit-down restaurant, but it's a pretty casual restaurant.  The wait seemed excessive.  I ordered the Singapore Orange and hubby had the Original PoBoy.  We shared our meals and I'm sorry to say, I was under-whelmed and felt queezy from all the saltiness.  We drank tons of water thru the night and still had a funky after-taste the next day (YUCK!).  I really wanted to like Green as I've enjoyed other Vegan restaurants.  I think they have way too many cuisines.  They serve: Thai, Indian, American, Italian, Greek & Mexican.  Focus on one or two and make them exceptional.",

Okay, I get it, this isn't a 'health' restaurant -- it's a vegan alternative for fast food and whatnot, but a girl can dream.  I have to say their fries are still my favorite and their noodle/rice bowls are delish. Uhhh and their fresh green tea/limeade/lemonades are so good. Mix them all up for the perfect beverage.

Great food.    My wife and I enjoyed the wings both times we visited this establishment, we highly recommend (make sure they give you their vegan ranch!).  First time we were there we also tried a Po Boy and it was good.  Second trip there, we had the Jerk Tofu Salad which let me tell you was some damn good tofu salad!!!  We also tried the Mac n Cheese and it was good in the sense if they did use nutritional yeast it wasn't overpowering, tasted like real mac n cheese but lighter.  We were hungry so we also ordered the samosas which were good, I thought the sauce needed more heat but that is just because I like spicy food.  Next time we are in Phoenix we will definitely stopping in again!",

Now, in a time where vegan options are much more prevalent, Green has raised its prices to almost fine dining level.  If the food was truly gourmet, I would not have an issue with the increase.  However, the food tends to be overly salty and is very hit or miss.  More times than not, I have been disappointed with my meal due to careless preparation (e.g. over-cooked, skimpy toppings, etc.).  Hopefully Green will start imposing better quality control standards in their kitchen.  Until then, I can easily get my vegan junk food fix by going to Whole Foods.  It is surprisingly easy to make a vegan Big Mac at home for a fraction of the price.",

    "text": "I'm not a vegetarian, but my good friend (who was with me) is and has been for a long time, so we decided to check out Green New American Vegetarian (actually, it's Vegan).   I'm glad we did!  The place is super cool inside - definitely a trendy place with a lot of young people.  We got there just in time, before the lunch rush, because at about noon, the place was insanely packed!  The menu is pretty big, so there are a lot of choices for the True Vegans.  I ordered the green hummus dish to start - really good and spicy - but not too spicy. The pita chips are freshly made and have a nice spice on them, too.  I didn't get the pickle garnish... a little strange.  I had the small Green Salad - it was really super de-lish.  The dressing was also a little spicy, but it made it really great.  Tons of green olives - so, you better like olives (which I do).  My friend ordered the Argentine Po-Boy - she scarfed it down... she had the cole slaw side and said it was really yummy.  Keep in mind to get there early - the parking is big enough for about 10 cars (we were luck to get one of the last spots) and the place is small, but you'll love it!  Definitely worth trying - even if you're not a vegetarian!",

    "text": "First of all, we knew it was going to be good when we drove up and noticed the great smells from the parking lot! Let's start with the building and decor. Urban hip all the way, clean with a great vibe. I noticed and loved all of the recycled materials used so creatively in the decor. You can tell there are smart and creative people behind this business and it shows.  My girlfriend has been a vegetarian for 30+ years and while I am not, I do all of the cooking in our house and have developed an appreciation for this type of cuisine and am always looking for creative ways to spice up our meals. Most of the meat substitutes found in stores do not measure up to whatever they used as chicken-less chicken in their spicy buffalo wings. They were so flavorful, had a great meat texture, and the ranch dressing to cool it all off was delish. I can't wait to have them again! We then tried the Green Hummus. Again, very flavorful, the green part coming from a creative use of Poblano Peppers and drizzled with a little sesame oil. I thought the pita chips were a little greasy and since I try not to eat fried foods very much, I thought it would be cool if they offered and un-fried option but they don't. Then again, I didn't ask. Whatever they used to season the chips with was also very good and very flavorful. We then embarked upon the crabless-puffs. Nothing remarkable but for a creamy fried (Ughh) little puff, it was great. The \"Green\" salad was kind of blah compared to everything else we had, but it was fresh and organic and made me feel better about myself after munching down all the fried stuff. The service was super fast and friendly. I thought the pricing was dead-nuts. Even the bathrooms were cool! We can't wait to go back and try more things! We have a great appreciation for restaurateurs who actually pay attention to detail and take the time to develop a creative and super flavorful menu like this. Worth the drive, worth the money, worth our time = Five star review.",

Big WAC (I could eat this every day and die enormously fat and happy. I made moaning noises whilst eating to the horror of my lunch mates.) 4. Secret BBQ chicken sandwich (lunchmate who is a pretty die hard meat eater enjoyed it. Said the BBQ was good, texture was fine \"but definitely not chicken.\") 5.  Iced tea (I drank at least 5 glasses. So tasty and fresh!)  It took 45 minutes to get my TO-GO order. No apologies given. Other people came in, ordered, ate and left while I was still waiting. Place was crazy busy. Everyone looked happy though. I think my experience was an anomaly.   Bottom line, I will definitely be going back. Much more to try!",

    "text": "I'm a confirmed carnivore. I admire my sharp, pointy canine teeth designed for ripping flesh off of a bone. I have an deep, abiding love for pastrami, ham and steak. Heck, I even like bologna and hot dogs-- the worst of the worst.  But if there ever was a reason to \"go vegetarian,\" it's in Central Phoenix at Green, who tout their cuisine as \"New American Vegetarian.\" This means it isn't all ooky cubes of bland tofu thrown into some stir fry or thin Mung Bean Soup. It is, however, 100% vegan with gluten free options.  Although Chef Damon Brasch, the mastermind behind Green, promotes his menu as \"comfort\" food, that may be a bit of a stretch. There's absolutely no substitute for, say, Shepherd's Pie, bacon or a roast beef dinner. Sorry. However, Green does have an attractive array of dining options that are very, very tasty, flavorful and filling.  The Spicy Peanut Chicken Salad presents spicy peanut mock chickenover fresh greens, carrots tossed in miso vinaigrette and tortilla strips. ($6 sm/$9 lg). Very appealing.  The Kung Pao Mock Chicken Bowl offers spicy ginger and garlic tamari sauce with crushed peanuts. Eight different bowls are on the menu with lots of veggies (of course) plus your choice of chicken, beef (mock), house or fresh tofu. Choose from either pan fried noodles or organic brown rice.  Take your pick from nine different po- boys, sandwiches and burgers. The \"No Harm Parm\" po-boy features a breaded mock-chicken cutlet with tasty Mum's tomato sauce and a dazzling mozzarella cheese. But the bread ... you have to try their bread. Phenomenal. All these are between $8.50-$9 and come with your choice of thyme fries, fresh fruit, or an incredible dolphin-safe Tahini Coleslaw which will knock your free-range socks off.  Green's cooler has a vast and delightful range of ice teas, sodas, mineral waters and flavored Kombucha that's a pleasure for any diner's palate.   You'll never see Colonel Sanders, Ronald McDonald or Long John Silver in here--but during our visit we saw Hollywood's handsome Kal Penn of stoner flick Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle. (He must've had the munchies, dude.) He didn't find the legendary 100% beef hamburgers there, but he was in the right place for one fine veggie burger.",

With heavenly Daiya vegan cheeses and Tofutti ricotta cheese out there, it is possible to make ooey-gooey vegan dishes. However, the gratine was still tasty.   The vegan crab puffs were crispy and had a nice texture, but fell a little flat with flavor. Perhaps a dash or two of kelp flakes would give them a bit of ocean spark. The dipping sauce and lime wedge added extra needed kick though.   The absolute delight of the meal was the big Wac sandwich-- 2 veggie burgers that had an awesome flame broiled taste were smothered in a special sauce and then layered with pickles, lettuce, and onions. All this between two sesame seed buns-YUM!!! Next weekend, (if we wait that long!!) we are going to try the BBBQ (vegan)bacon burger and mac n cheez with veggies.  I Love vegan comfort food!!!",

Yelped \"vegetarian\" and saw this place, whose menu was reminiscent of one my favorite spots back home in NYC, Red Bamboo.  This is veggie-friendly reimaginings of classic American comfort food. Po Boys. Egg rolls. Buffalo \"wings.\" Some asian fusion-style bowls as well.  The food was excellent. Service was quick - and very friendly (being a NY-er, I was a little overly conscious about taking up too much of the server's time, but they loved chatting!).   EXCELLENT beer selection and wine on tap!  And it was CHEAP, given the quality of the ingredients and portions. Since I knew I wouldn't be back soon, I wanted to sample a lot and the cashier warned me that I was ordering way too much food for one person (I did), but I went ahead and the bill was less $25 including a glass of wine.   Really awesome, forward-thinking place. Made me reconsider my evaluation of Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale after a week there. Glad to see this kind of spot in Arizona and I hope it does gangbusters and inspires other similarly-minded businesses (I think it will - I was especially encouraged by the diversity of customers. Old war vets you'd expect to sneer at some fancy-pants non-meat, hearty salt-of-the-earth families, etc. Definitely not what you'd expect at a very urban-hip type place!)  I then went to their sister vegan ice cream/coffee shop, Nami, which was excellent and I will review later.",

It took me forever to find this place because, being an out of towner, I did not realize there is a N. 7th Street and a N. 7th Avenue both of which intersect McDowell Road. Anyway, I got to the restaurant and ordered the spicy buffalo \"wings\" to go and had a glass of the local wine while I waited at the table and waited and waited...  I love the clever and artistic design of the place, especially the detailed little touches. I had visited the website before coming and loved the chef's story. I really wanted to love this place. Alas, the wine was meh though I loved that it came in a little mason jelly jar. Also, it took forever to get the one thing that I had ordered. It's not like the place was packed; orders were coming out of the kitchen. When other people who ordered just before and after I did got their food, I went up to check. The cashier checked on it and said it would be right out. Finally, 10 minutes later I got my bag and bounced.  The spicy buffalo \"wings\" just weren't that good. The breaded \"mock\" meat was overcooked and too chewy. The glaze on it was just ok. I eat (and cook) vegetarian all the time and have had some fantastic eats; this was a disappointment.",

Who would have thought that the meat eater would be a bigger pussy than the vegan? It's okay though, I'm a girl who likes beer so I'll give myself a pat on the back for that.   Anyway, after dinner we went next door where my friend Mariah served us up so vegan treats. I originally tried making up my own Tsoynami creation but after a few minutes I just let her surprise me.

We took a risk to try infamous spicy buffalo \"wings\" and we loved it to death! It tastes exactly like a regular chicken. The buffalo sauce was at it's perfect spiciness. As for meals, I ordered original \"g\" spicy po-boy with thyme fries and my partner ordered secret BBQ chicken sandwich with thyme fries. We both loved them and eat them all up! Absolutely delicious! And the staffs were so friendly and knew how to communicate with us in a heartbeat because we both are deaf. We are coming back no question about it! We will try Nami's their little sister 100% vegan bakery. You need to take your friends over here!!",

The Thai Peanut was my favorite by far - WOW it was good.   I'm not a big fan of beef, but the mock beef was delicious. The sauce was a bit spicy, and happily not very sweet. Very, very good.  I didn't find the Diablo Red quite as appealing, but that's just a personal preference. Service was very friendly, and it took only a few minutes for our food to be delivered to our table. A very, very good meal.",

    "text": "So strange watching this previously great restaurant plummet. The food is no longer noteworthy and the experience is below enjoyable. I have visited the Tempe location Green since 2010, and the Phoenix location since it opened. Meals that were once well made and adequately portioned now represent a hastily prepared snack. The menu has shrunk, and items that used to be paired - such as the Argentine Po' boy (no longer on the menu) and fries - are now sold separately. Remarkably, while menu items have removed major portions of the meal, the prices of these orders have all risen. Eliminating standard portions from long-standing meals and increasing prices is a bold move, and the absurdity is further compounded by the noticeably lower quality food. It simply isn't that enjoyable. The family members and friends I previously took to Green would always rave about the food and experience; I would not consider such an outing in the restaurant's current state.   *Fun Fact: the largest portioned meal is also one of the least expensive. Try ordering the chicken nuggets from the kids' menu. It looks like that section of the menu is still unchanged. I imagine the owners will make the necessary adjustments if they read this review (sorry kiddos).  The owners seem to be banking on reputation and being the only somewhat hip vegetarian restaurant in town. Using smaller sizes, higher prices, and fewer ingredients are all decent ways to increase net profit, but what happens to your once loyal customer base? Even the soynamis have smaller cups. Absurd.",

It can be a bit pricey, but I've discovered that if my husband and I each get a bowl and cups of lemonade we can keep it to about $20, which makes it much more wallet friendly for an impromptu weeknight dinner out.  Their curry bowl with fried tofu and noodles is one of my favorites, it's spicy, flavorful and piping hot.  Also their buffalo 'chicken' wings are fantastic, and very 'meaty' and spicy!  Tip: Avoid the pre-bottled sodas and drinks in the case, they are SILLY expensive.  Just get one of the cups for an in-house beverage (tea, lemonade, etc.) from the dispenser on the counter, they are very yummy and refillable.",

There's lots of younger people going in and out of it so there's a nice vibe at the place. It has vegetarian as well as vegan options and in general it's a nice progressive place.

The big wac is messy but it taste very similar to the Big Mac without the guilt. I love their sweet potato tots and their French Fries as well.

So, the people were great and helpful when it came to my first-timer questions about what to order (vegan gyro, singapore noodles) for the hubs and me, and plain lo mein noodles for the kiddo. My concern always about a serious vegetarian place is that they skew snobby, rather than populist and happy. Green is the latter. Go Green - nice work! PS: yes the food is awesome. Just eat here, even if you like meat.",

The menu being American fusion is really diverse. I ordered the Red Diablo (with mock chicken) which was a pretty impressive asian stir-fry brown rice bowl. All the veggies were cooked perfectly as was the brown rice in a tasty sweet spicy sauce. Other options ranged from pizza to almost any typical sports bar styled sandwich such as Buffalo chicken or 'pulled' portobello mushroom. Pricing is fair; $7-8 for most main dishes. Check out Nomi next door for coffee, tea and plenty of vegan deserts, too.",

We were both completely amazed at how good our meal was and are sure to be repeat customers.   It was difficult to decide what to have since almost every item on the  menu looked delicious. I finally settled on the No Harm Chicken Parm with Thyme Fries and my husband had Wendy's Pickle with Tyme Fries. We both had green tea to drink.   Our sandwiches were both delicious. This was my first try at vegan cheese and the faux mozzarella on my sandwich was delicious and added just the perfect touch. The tomato sauce was rich and garlicky and balanced out all of the flavors.    My husband took one bite of his sandwich and declared, \"This is really good!\" High praise from a man who eats everything but rarely gets excited by any of it. We both loved the bread our sandwiches were on and thought the fries were awesome.  We will be back, Green, to try all of the delicious items on your menu. Next up: The Big Wack!",

Two Big Wacs, 2 orders of thyme fries, and \"wings\".   All of our food came out really quick. Wings first, followed by the burgers. The wings were great! Good flavor and the dilly ranch paired very well with them. The Big Wacs were great! A little too salty for my taste, but I still thoroughly enjoyed the burger and fries! My husband, a carnivore, was shocked at how much it tasted like the real deal. I've tried the famous vegan versions in other cities, but the Big Wac blows those out of the water!  While the service and food were both great, I feel the price was slightly too high. In my opinion, burgers should just come with a side of fries automatically.  Great restaurant that's definitely worth checking out.",

I got the Big Wac and animal fries, I don't know how they do it but it tasted exactly like a Big Mac and animal fries if not better than the original. Tried the buffalo wings and they were good as well. Price wasn't bad considering how good the food was. Place is nice with plenty of seating and drink options including alcohol. Only negative is there is not much parking. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Wow. What awful service! Ordered three meals for three different people on the same order and the first meal came out, followed five minutes later by the second, followed five minutes later by the third. The first meal (rice bowl) was cold by the time the last meal (avocado wrap) came out. Both were okay, not great. And the second meal (burger with coleslaw as a side)? Burger was garbage and tasted like i was being punished for ordering a veggie burger in a vegan restaurant, while the coleslaw was good, but probably only because of the overwhelming sweetness of its sauce. There was no apology or acknowledgement of the huge gap in time between meals, and to make matters worse, the waitress opens the garage door that serves as the front of the building and forced people to put their jackets back on as they were blasted with cold air. Why would you open the whole restaurant to the outside on December 28?To distract us from the cold food on our plates with the cold wind from outside? My coworker said, \"I like the atmosphere in Green's Tempe location much better.\" Although she was referring to the murals and decor, she could just as easily have been referring to the climate, because unless it's got a cold arctic wind blowing in from the north, it couldn't be worse.",

There is not enough spaces to accommodate the massive crowd that is always there. I've had many near accidents in the parking lot, there are hardly any spaces available, and the layout is awful. If you can take an Lyft I would recommend it. Also, prepare yourself for a large crowd stuffed into a tiny space. After a few bad experiences here I choose to go to the Scottsdale Rd location even though the 7th street location is much closer to home. The owners should really consider expanding this locations facilities. I know I'd go a lot more often if it was a better experience.",

    "text": "There's not much more to be said about Green, but I wanted to make this my 100th review because I'm a sap like that. Green (and chef Damon) has revolutionized the greater Phoenix vegan community. Sure, there are healthier dining options, better parking and better service at other vegan places in town now, but without Green's leadership, it might have never been possible. It's too crowded? Hooray! More people not eating meat! It's too expensive? They actually pay employees a decent wage, and use unique ingredients that make our bellies happy (usually). It is hands down always my top recommendation when people as \"where can I get vegan food?\" or when someone comes to town who might be so inclined.   Rather than going into menu items, I'll give a hat tip to the regular specials. By far the one that makes me say \"Let's go now\" is the Grinder. I'm not a huge mock lunch meat fan, but the way the Grinder comes together with oil, pepperoncini, and mock salami-like meats and cheese is cosmic. Other favorites are the street tacos, anything with beans (which is my only real Green complaint - give me some beans on the menu, Damon!), or almost anything with hot dogs (but the recent hot dog stuffed pepper was a step too far for us). We recently had the bangers and mash special - a very fun vegan treat!  In short - Green is a Phoenix treasure and I hope it survives and thrives for decades to come!",

    "text": "Love that there is a vegan place in Tempe! It is pretty simple decoration inside, but they do have a good selection of food. They have bowls and burgers and some sides like fries. We had the coconut curry  bowl and the Chinese ginger flavored one. I like the curry one, curry taste was mild. And someone was very hungry and got another \"Big Mac\", it was too salty. The bun looks sad, but tasted good. And they do have some beer and wine selection. When bf asked the counter boy for recommendation what's good. He mumbled and then he said he doesn't drink. Bf said that he hadn't been drinking for a long time. The boy said 'why start now?' Wow!! That clicked! Bf realized that he shouldn't drink under his condition now, and decided to keep record clean. Thank you so much for helping save him from falling!",

Even when our cousin came to visit just a couple of years ago...I was just like...okay it is better than I thought. Now with all of that being said, I have 3 recommendations for food choices if you decide to visit this establishment.  The Buffalo Wings The Wendy's Pickle (might be the best chicken sandwich in AZ) The Big Wac (think McDonald's but better of course)  All missing is the IMPOSSIBLE Burger here but maybe one day they will get it. Eat, Drink, and be Merry, my Friends!!!!!",

It is a consistent issue I have at both locations that their food is overly greasy. The only thing I've ever enjoyed is the Thai salad, but the chicken on top makes the greens wilt and get greasy. Over the years, this has been my consistent review, yet I keep going back hoping it will get better.",

The staff is super welcoming and even at their busiest are still super friendly. The prices are very reasonable and you feel full after the meal. My husband was skeptical (as he is still a meat and potatoes guy) but came with me to support me. The chili cheese fries and Big WAC won him over to come here with me.

We went here at lunch time. You walk up to the counter, order, and sit down to wait for food delivery. We ordered the hummus, the samosas, and the coconut curry bowl with the house tofu. We quickly had the hummus delivered and then.... crab puffs? Woops. Well, we had discussed the crabpuffs, so we figured they just put in the wrong order. That was ok, we were happy to try them. The crab puffs were good... I don't like regular crab puffs, but the veg version was fairly tasty, creamy, and crispy on the outside. The hummus was very good, a little spicy, but overall tasty... now, it was no Pita Jungle hummus... definitely not at the same caliber, but it was good. I liked the crispy pita chips, but I think it might be better with just normal pita. Anyway, I guess they realized they brought out the wrong item (crab puffs) and they brought us the samosas... woohoo! The samosas were by far the best item I tried there. They were cinnamon -y and delicious... crispy with a wonderful filling. I would come back here just for the samosas...yum. The curry bowl was also good, but I wish it had more sauce.... it wasn't the most flavorful food I've ever had, especially for a curry. I would want to try it again to see if maybe it was just lacking sauce on the day we were there. I will definitely be back here!  PS the decor here is beautiful, very clean and modern.  PPS the prices are affordable- less than 10$ per person",

OH MY STARS!  pair the Wac with the thyme fries and you have complete perfection. The people running the place are super nice, and this location even serves wine and beer.  The restaurant itself is very nice inside-sort of casual elegant.  I would highly recommend it for date night if it weren't so hard to hear your companion when inside.  They have a tiny back patio, and a larger front patio-so if you can score one of those tables-you'll really enjoy your meal.  They have a companion vegan bakery next door and that's where you get the soynamis instead of at Green--go next door too!  It should be 5 stars but it did take quite a while to get our meal, and it's really hard to hear inside.  Food is 5 stars though-NO QUESTION.",

I wasn't one of them, but that didn't stop me from ordering a pasta bowl with a meatless add on. It was heavenly. The taste is simple yet more than enough, and the variety in the menu is plain fun to look through! For not being a vegetarian, I come here a lot more than I should.  It might seem that it mostly appeals to young crowds who look for different and conscious approaches to their food, but anyone can try it and fall in love with it like I did. It's well-made food that delivers and makes you feel good while eating it.  Parking is a bit of a challenge if you have a large car because it's quite narrow, but spaces are usually open when it's not busy.   The decor is clean and minimalist; you can't help but fall in love with that Ice-T ice machine, pun intended.   All in all, if you feel pretty cool for coming to place like this, embrace it. It's a rad and one-of-a-kind place to eat at.",

No server came to our table, not sure if they were supposed to hit we went up to order and the woman said oh I'll tell her to come to you, so we went and sat back down and about 5 minutes she took our order, food came out in a timely manner, but after that the server was MIA.",

Balsamic picnic salad  Leave room for a Tsoynami. Just walk next door to NAMI and wait to be amazed. This place smells like sugar and coffee heaven.",

    "text": "Let me just preface by saying I am not a vegan. Actually, I am the opposite of a vegan and indulge in red meat pretty frequently. However, a good vegan friend of mine wanted to try this place out and I am so glad I did! We went on a Wednesday afternoon and it was packed. The parking situation is not favorable, so try and carpool if you can. Luckily, we ordered and were able to snag  a table at the front. I had the Thai Peanut Bowl with mock chicken and it was surprisingly, really good! It was loaded with fresh veggies and the perfect amount of sauce. The only aspect I found lacking was. . .salt. I'm not sure if I am desensitized by the morbid amount of soy sauce I consume at home - I most likely am. Don't get me wrong, the meal was amazing but I think a dash or two of salt would have made this meal perfect. The mock chicken was also surprisingly yummy. It had the consistency of a frozen chicken nugget (odd) but the flavor was spot on. I would definitely visit again! I am dying to try the Big Wac.",

This was my first experience at Green and as a vegan, I don't think I'd bring a non-vegan here hoping that they'd think vegan food was super tasty.    My (non-vegan) friend and I both thought our sandwiches were over-sauced and he actually couldn't even finish his. I will say the texture of the mock chicken was good...but, again, the sauce (mine was BBQ) was way to overpowering.   I guess if you're vegan and are craving something meat-like, this would be the place to go.    I might go back to try a non-sandwich menu item...  Also, it would have been nice had the waitress not taken my half-eaten meal off our table when I got up to refresh my drink.  While it wasn't the best lunch ever, it was still my lunch and I would have liked to have finished it.",

We are all veg in our house, and my son's a picky eater and also a homebody, but he loves to come have their veggie burger and fries.  While I can't name all the dishes I've had there, I can certainly vouch for the BBQ chicken sandwich and burger, and I've only had one dish there that didn't excite me, but that's a pretty good track record considering the number of times we've eaten here.    Love the atmosphere here and enjoy occasionally sitting with people we don't know at the bigger tables.  As others have said, there is very little parking.  We've always been lucky and found a space, but if you can bike here, then I highly recommend doing so (so there is more parking for me).",

I ordered the small ranchero salad (which was substantial enough to have been my entire meal) and the special, which was a sandwich of tempura cauliflower with melted cheddar, pickled beets and a spicy sauce (I don't remember what it was).  I took the components off of hte bun becuase the salad was filling me up, but was very pleased with the dish.  If I lived in Phoenix, it would be very difficult for me not to get that salad every single day.  It was delicious, hearty and perfectly dressed.  The service was quick and pleasant and the space is welcoming.  Check it out!  I know I'll be back next time I'm in Phoenix.",

I typically also love the staff, friendly, cordial, and seem to fit with the vision of this organization. Today was an exception. I ordered a to go order and arrived promptly. I could see my order sitting on the shelf. A petite nose ringed gal was taken an order to someone. Usually I am acknowledged at very least upon entrance, however nose ring girl was deeply entranced in conversation with the man making an order. While I understand the need for deeper connections between people in a fast paced world, I was in a hurry and starving. I was not even noticed and stood there for about ten minutes waiting for them to be done. She did a good job of explaining the menu but body language and gesture certainly gave light to a clear flirtation. Apparently his name is Dante, not Donte. I took off my sunglasses in hope eye contact would evoke some sort of recognition as I stared longingly at my food. I'm pretty sure she could not have bent over further to see down her tank top, shameless. I get it, young and beautiful abound this place, freedom to communicate and be loose is all good. This is a business as well and I wonder if this conduct of greens operating model. Ok I'm a little dramatic, but the bottom line is my food was cold, my sandwich was congealed and fallen apart, my salad wilted with cold mock chicken. So I just want to thank nose ring girl, my green perception is altered. Thank you to all the other staff who are friendly and a sheer delight, but ms nose ring girl, speaking from experience, being of service to ALL customers is a typical principle in food service. 1 star, not for green, 1 star for nose ring girl who clearly has an affection for up and coming hipster boys clearly I'll accustomed to female attention.

Green makes it a little easier :). The Big Wac is amazing, tastes better than a Big Mac and I have convinced a lot of carnivores to go try it. A few decided to go full vegetarian after knowing they could still get flavorful, comfortable tastes without having to settle on just rabbit food or squishy tofu. There are a few thing that didn't tickle my taste buds (the kids mac&cheese, tahini coleslaw and crab puff dipping sauce). But everything else I have really enjoyed. LOVE the Spicy Peanut Tofu as does my tofu-hating brother, which is saying a lot. The No-Harm Chicken Parm is the best and the Original \"G\" and BBQ Chicken/Portabello Mushroom Sandwiches are incredibly tasty. I like to ask for extra thyme for my fries because yes, depending on the kitchen, I have noticed it can get be a little skimpy :/. Overall, if you're in the area and willing to try something different, try Green.",

I really have no idea what I'm eating, but I've been a few times and haven't been disappointed.  Service/staff is pretty good, they definitely fit the theme of the place.

Also, the menu is not on the wall, but physical handouts you have to look at in line. I wish instead of alcohol they had some food items on the chalkboard.

    "text": "MY TAKEAWAY: Great food. Will hit the spot. Cheaper than most vegan establishments in NY and namely Brooklyn that I've frequented. The service leaves a lot to be desired. I would gladly be willing to pay more for a better customer service and overall end-user experience. Going out to eat or grabbing a bite outside of your home is more than just about getting good food, it's the totality of the experience. From how you order, the staff, speed, food quality and consistency, atmosphere, etc. This place is great already, as-is; however, if they want to take things to even bigger heights, they may want to revisit the way you order and/or the staff's ability to offer better customer service. Everything else is perfect. Maybe it's just the New Yorker in me, that has come to expect more. Food-wise this place even beats some of the best places to eat at in Brooklyn, NY. Yes, even those classified as some of the best Vegan establishments. I will be coming back. How often? Well, that is yet to be determined. If my customer service experience changes in future visits, which would make this place an easy 5 stars, I will be sure to update my review. This place is nearly perfect!  Green, the first vegan restaurant I've visited since moving to Phoenix, AZ. There is a decent selection of vegan establishments to choose from, yet I choose this place to try first. Mainly because before moving to Phoenix I was doing some research and came across this YouTube video featuring this establishment and it's next door bakery Nami. (link - <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dy5CwdOGYb88&s=f3eb2ebc1bb172b3897f4bb1d6c1fded9cad14c260e91015fba0e9c2ee24db11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=y5Cw...</a>) After seeing the passion behind the brand and mouth-watering food, I had to try it for myself, once I completed my move to Phoenix.    I've frequented this location on two occasions, once on a weekday and once on a weekend to get a better feel of the place.  First visit, a weekday: The service leaves a lot to be desired. You go up to the counter and order then have a sit and they bring you your food. The customer service and/or the end-user experience isn't the best, however, you don't go to a place like this for its service. I'm well aware of that; however, it would have made my experience that much better and truth be told the amount of times that I would frequent this place would have been a multiple of what it is or would be now. The food matched my expectations and slightly surpassed them. The BIG WAC, boy, oh, boy! Excellent. Filling, tasty and utterly satisfying. My burger fix, as a vegan, has been fulfilled in the most pleasant of ways. Their wings are also amazing. I tried them on this visit.   Second visit, a weekend day: Service slightly worse than my weekday experience. There was a line to order unlike my first visit, but no worries because the line moved fast. The staff was very efficient in managing the high traffic. I'll give them that. Overall, customer service was a little worse than my earlier visit. Food was great again. I'm liking the overall consistency from my only two visits thus far, food wise. I ordered the BIG WAC again, fantastic.   That has been my experience. You should try it for yourself. It's more than worth it. I hope this added value to someone out there.  Happy Yelping :)",

I ordered the Big Wac burger and thyme fries and fell in love immediately. It was literally the vegan version of the old school (circa 1979-1982) Big Mac sandwich from McDonalds (back when McDonalds used actual beef and not \"meat product\". My colleague had a salad that he was very pleased with, and we shared the eggless spring rolls which were also amazing. I recommend this place to anyone looking for great vegan food in a relaxed/chill and casual environment. Unfortunately the place closes at 9pm so if you're going to go, go early.",

    "text": "I think the concept of this place is really nice. There is only one vegan based restaurant in Cincinnati, so it's pleasant to find a place that only serves vegan food.  The inside is really nice and they honestly have a lot of seating. When you initially see the place, it looks really small but you will be surprised once you go in. You can sit outside, front or back.  It can become crowded when trying to order food because the counter is pretty large and takes up space, but that's a small complaint.  I ordered the Wendy's pickle burger and thyme fries the first day and the second day I ordered the Brussel sprout salad with the buffalo wings.  I thought the burger was pretty good - I'm not a fan of a lot of fried food because of the grease. The burger was a tad bit greasy and I would hope that they would drain it a bit more. The fries were okay. I'm not sure if I was supposed to taste the thyme or not.  I would probably not get the Brussel sprout salad again. The Brussel sprouts were fried and I did not like that. Maybe I'm old fashioned but I like my greens to stay green  the Brussel sprouts were waaayyy to greasy. I bit into it and oil came out - I think roasted Brussel sprouts would be better.  The buffalo wings were pretty good and the dressing for the salad was pretty tasty. Overall I think the place is nice and the food is pretty decent. I'm not a fan of fried food but I got it anyways in hopes that they did it different because it was vegan and hopefully healthier but that was not the case. I think others might like this which is why I didn't rate the restaurant bad because it's more of a preference rather than a standard.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I am an avid meat eater who is in no way veggie forward. I can count the number of vegan/vegetarian specific meals I've had on one hand.   I came with a group of friends who love Green and have been raving about it for years, literally years. So I finally caved and decided to give the place a shot. I tried the chicken sandwich with avocado, chili fries with cheese, hot wings and the eggless egg rolls.  The restaurant was busy but not \"impossible to find seating,\" level of busy. Though parking was definitely tricky. We sat and the egg rolls and chili fries quickly arrived. The egg rolls are fantastic and the chili fries are definitely something I will get again, as a person who doesn't enjoy ground meat I liked that chili better than ordinary chili.  Then my friends big wac, my other friend's curry and my chicken sandwich all arrived. No mention of my boyfriend's dish or the hot wings. But we couldn't wait and dug in. One friend loved the thousand island that came with the big wac but wasnt a huge fan of the burger itself. The curry was fantastic with fried tofu. And my sandwich left me a bit confused. It had the initial feel of chicken and definitely the look but was very bland. Next time I'll stick to a more veggie solid meal rather than a meat substitute.   My boyfriend's meal and the wings didn't arrive until after everyone was finished. Thankfully there was just enough room in our stomachs to give the wings a try and they were fantastic as well.   In all I would suggest this place if you're feeling a salad dish or appetizers as that's where the taste really shinned for myself. I wish the service had been a bit better, or if they had communicated a bit more. And I would have appreciated salt or hot sauce on the table to umph the taste of my sandwich a bit, but their fries are delish!",

My partner got the Sesame Dragon rice bowl once and what I sampled of it was phenomenal.   My only gripe would be that the fried brussels should be served on a plate/larger bowl and they should all be cut in half and then roasted (got both and the full size brussels are just hard to eat)  Also that the \"thyme fries\" do not have any visible thyme and if the flavor is there it is a bit more subtle than I would hope for. I also tend to prefer a thicker fry, but they are a decent fry nonetheless.  Love the 'Ice Cube' machine  and the Electric Nectar juice! Can't wait to go back and try out happy hour and some of the other menu items!  My advice is to save a little room for their tSoynami ice cream at Nami's next door!",

The store is very modern and cute and there is always such a fun group Of people in there eating and working. We never feel out of place.

The bf and I both ordered bowls, I had the sesame dragon bowl with house tofu and the bf ordered the Singapore orange bowl with their mock chicken. We also ordered the spicy buffalo wings as an app. The bowls had absolutely zero flavor. I tried a bite of my bfs and he tried mine as well, and both were just \"meh\". And the veggies weren't quite cooked, but weren't raw either. Just not impressed. The lemonade was extremely sweet as well and made it difficult to swallow. I did enjoy the buffalo wings, and the sauce and ranch were on point, so props to you guys!   So I guess I am now 50/50 with this place, but I'm sure I'll be back the next time I'm in town, I'll just skip the bowls.",

It runs along diners tables which causes you to literally stand over them as they are eating their meal. As a person who suffers from severe anxiety this makes it really difficult. I didn't actually get to eat here bc there was only one cashier at the time and I had already waited about 10 mins just to order. I had seen some of the dishes come out and they didn't look too appetizing so I ended up leaving. Kinda sucks bc I wanted to give them a try but the overall experience was a turn off.",

Super glad that we did because we have put green new American  on our rotation of restaurants.

Now I am just trying to be vegan, and this place keeps me on track. This Wisconsin girl loves cheese, and the west coast fries satisfy my craving. I recommend getting the big wac or classic burger and using some of the cheese from your fries on your burger. So good! The staff is always great! The fresh bevvies are delicious amd made with organic cane sugar too. The crab puffs are cravable! The bff is great, but I like the burgers even better. I love you, Green! Recommendations: crab puffs, the earthling (it's a special), the west coast fries, And the cheesesteak. I LOVE this place. I am now a committed vegan thanks to Green.",

I die for The BFF, made with fresh jalapenos, cheddar, avocado and ranch drizzled. Yum!! Or the famous Big Wac that has even my Utah friends craving to eat it again. The Wendys pickle tastes just like a Wendys chicken sandwich, crazy! They nailed it here. Now if you guys could make a vegan chickfilet sandwich pretty please you guys elses be straight murdering it in the vegan food game!!",

They're a bit pricey, so It's not something I eat often, but it's a great treat for those times that I'm craving that comfort food that's harder to score as a vegan.   What's even greater about this place is that the food is SO good that even non-vegans eat there. My meat-eating husband often craves their buffalo \"wings\".   I highly recommend the buffalo wings or the Big Wac (which is Green's take on the McDonalds' Big Mac.   The people who work there are also great. They've always been very polite and the service is fairly quick and always friendly. I heard somewhere that the head chef and creator of the Green menu even won some culinary award. I'm not sure if that's True, but it wouldn't be hard to believe based on the taste!   If you're a vegan looking for some hard to find comfort food, or if you're a meat-eater looking to either dabble in the vegan cuisine or need to take a vegan friend or significant other to lunch, I HIGHLY recommend this place!",

My review about the food is like everyone else overall. We were most disappointed in the service. I can always appreciate when an explanation is given to a first timer, who doesn't know how they run the restaurant. None was given, fine. So we leave a tab open after ordering apps because we wanted to eat as we went and didn't know what to expect for four people. You basically have to expect a do-it-yourself type service. The two front of house people were rude and short with us. The blonde female seemed as if she was having a terrible day and it rubbed off on the rest of the staff. I asked where I could park my grandpa's walker and I suggested an empty corner and she said no, that I should keep it at the table. That has never happened. We asked for side plates and got rolled eyes. The poor service alone definitely discourages us ever returning.",

Ordered the curry bowl also and we had so much food that we had to save it and finish the rest of it for the next day, but it was awesome because we wanted to go back for more buffalo wings and realized that they wouldn't be open till later on and our plane was leaving. If your a vegetarian or vegan or even a meat eater.. I promise this place will not disappoint! Its mad awesome delicious!",

Pure heaven!  I also enjoyed the chili and my husband loved his sandwich.  We will be returning, frequently.  We also stopped into the vegan ice cream store next door and it was also outstanding, what a great addition to this community!  service was also well above average, I am talking about outstanding, I had a ton of questions and she gladly answered them all.",

    "text": "Green, I'm so glad you've opened up a midtown location.   In college, when I lived in Tempe, I'd frequent green very regularly. After I graduated and moved downtown, I'd drive myself over to the Scottsdale Rd. location as often as possible for the sweet and sour bowl, the smores tsoynami, and whatever yummy baked goods were fresh that day.   So here's the scoop, for all of you soon-to-be enthusiasts.   Green serves 100% vegan food. That means no dairy, eggs, gelatin, etc. However, their food isn't 'healthy'. That's not a dig-they do casual, 'comfort'-style vegan food that you'd be hard-pressed to distinguish as being vegan.  With mac and cheese, burgers, rice/noodle bowls, salads, buffalo wings, etc, green has a little something for just about any craving.   After your meal, go next door to their joint dessert/coffee bar and snag yourself a tsoynami. Just. Do. It.   The (few) downsides-  They changed their menu a few months ago, and I was pretty bummed-some of the items that I loved and ordered regularly throughout the years were replaced. I was kind of disappointed when they first rolled out some of the new items, but it's definitely gotten MUCH better/consistent.   I've gone with a few non-vegan/vegetarian friends, and while all of them have been pleasantly surprised with the food they've ordered, sometimes the staff hasn't been too keen on explaining things, making substitutions, etc. That's kind of a bummer. I feel like it's improved, though, and the Phoenix location feels less hipstery-'cliquey' than the green I first encountered five or six years ago.   It's downtown. Parking is limited and tight. Carpool!",

I've been to Green several times is the last few months, as I've traveled to and through Phoenix, and I have really liked everything... except that I wish they went easier with the salt on some of the dishes.  Maybe Green thinks non-vegans will find vegan food more flavorful with lots of salt, and of course salt does magnify flavors, but they just use too much of it.  It's the burgers especially that I feel are too salty (I've had the Calexico burger and the BBBQ bacon burger).  Tip: you get a choice of 4 fake meats in the bowls, and of the 2 I've tried (mock chicken and house tofu), the house tofu was the star.  Nice flavor (just a tad too salty) and chew.  Also, the tahini coleslaw that comes with the burgers is excellent.",

Wow, those crab puffs were amazing! Since being vegan, I have missed having crab rangoons/crab cheese wontons at restaurants, and these tasted just like the real thing!! I had the thai peanut rice bowl, which was great (huge serving too, especially after all the appetizers, so I had leftovers!) and hubby loved the bbq sammie. Just when you think it can't get any more awesome, theres the Tsoynamis! Holy moly!!!!! These are like mcflurries/blizzards but with vegan soft-serve and all of your favorite goodies incorporated in. Some of the best dessert I've ever had!!",

No worries as they were quick to say, \"Come on in!\"  Prior to our arrival we didn't know if Green was a sit-down or counter service.  Upon entering we found that it would be a counter service experience.  Nice and laid back. I immediately loved the flow of the restaurant with the painted wooden tables along with tree stumps for some of the seats.  Patio dining is available but the far end also has a see-through garage door that can be opened up for open air dining too.  Quick examination of the menu had me wanting everything.  It's so nice not to have to decipher which items are vegan and which ones aren't.  I settled on the Mexicali Burger.  However, when I went to order I noticed the special....\"The Big Wac\".  What?!  This is what everyone has been talking about in the Green Facebook Group. You see, The Big Wac is basically the vegan version of the Big Mac.  It's not always available and absolutely everyone was raving about it.  I made the quick switch, ordered the Big Wac with fries and my husband ordered the Kung Pao bowl.  Did the Big Wac live up to the rave reviews? Yes, and more! Although I admit I was never a huge burger person even prior to going veg this may be one of the best burgers I've had in my life.  Seriously.  My husband's meal was also tasty but after a nibble of my burger he immediately wished he had gone for the Big Wac too. Partnered with the yummy thin fries I had the perfect meal.  I can't wait to return to have another fantastic meal!",

    "text": "I've been a patron of Green New for about 2 years now. I'm from Los Angeles, but have a ton of friends in Arizona and discovered this place via Yelp. On every visit I made it a point to stop at Green New. I moved here in November and have only been 3 times. My 2 visits were just as I remember it! Excellent on every level. This last visit - Not so much. My husband and I went in for a Big Wac. We were about to place our order when I looked down and noticed the menu's looked different. I inquired about them, and was told they had an updated menu with new items. We decided to take a quick look and apparently they downsized....and raised the prices. The Big Wac no longer comes with a side, but is now $8.95 for just the sandwich and all sides are additional. We wanted fries and those are now $3.75. Whatever. We knew it was going to be good and we drove 35 minutes for this specific meal, so we ordered. The woman with the red hair was very nice, took our order and gave us our water cups. The thin pale woman with the short dark hair looked as if she hated her job. No smile, no warmth, she appeared to be just miserable. Totally not the friendly faces I'm used to! Really weird to see because everyone has always been super cool! I even made friends with one of the manager ladies who always recognized us and knew about our treks back and forth from Los Angeles. Anyway, out came our food, served to us by the dark haired girl. She said \"Enjoy\" and took off. Eh, no matter, cause I'm about to get down on this Big Wac! So I took a bite and it was tasty as ever! Picked up a fry and that sucker was cold and hard. The portion was a handful and they were unseasoned! WTH?! What happened to the seasoning? So I asked my husband if he wanted a dipping sauce and he asked for a side of 1000. I get up and wait at the counter...and wait...and wait...and wait. These people have just taken my order and just served me my food, but I was forced to wait in line while other patrons ordered and all I needed was a side of 1000. And it's not like they didn't see me. The girl who served me my food was looking right at me while she was just stood around. By the time I was given my sauce my food was cold and my fries were stiffer then when they were served to me! NOT COOL!!  My Big Wac was just like I remembered it - DELICIOUS. The service, however, was not. Of course I'll go back because the food is tasty. I'll just need to prepare for the bad attitudes the next time I visit.",

    "text": "We're giving three stars overall based on: 1.) Quality of ingredients 2.) 100% Vegan (which is rare) 3.) Gluten-Free offerings 4.) The diversity of the menu, including baked goods and vegan \"ice cream\" treats 5.) Okay, and they also serve alcohol  We can't give more stars because they were not earned.  We'd LIKE to give this place more stars, but we're very discerning. We went twice this week--once at each location. At the Phoenix location my companion had a noodle bowl with tofu, and I had the gluten-free rice bowl with tofu. Each bowl comes with a choice of protein: tofu, mock chicken or mock beef. You're getting charged for it, so you might as well pick one. We shared an artichoke dip appetizer that is gluten-free.  At the Tempe/Scottsdale location we opted for the large size artichoke heart salad. We had to choose a protein (it comes with it) so we chose mock blackened chicken.  We'll start by saying the sauces were terrific (Mongolian and coconut curry). We both enjoyed our flavor choices at each location.  The artichoke dip appetizer was very tasty and we would recommend it.  The downside: Take a close look at the photos and you will see large chunks of carrot and zucchini. While  we normally like these vegetables (we should--we are 90% vegan in our household and have high standards for a diversity of vegetables and food preparation. We also manage food allergies), we did not care for the \"bite\". The vegetables are crisp, about half-cooked, which is usually okay but not in this dish. We are actually used to preparing our dishes with these raw (100% uncooked) because we grate them or spiralize them, but we prefer them fully cooked when they are in large chunks.  Experiment/Note: Try shaving vegetables, grating them, or spiralizing them vs. chopping them into large chunks. You will find that the flavor profile is way different. Especially with a red onion. Thinly sliced is heavenly, but grate them and you're in for a horrible bitter taste that can ruin a dish completely. Super large chunks of red onion in a salad? Unheard of. Yuck. Same goes for carrots and zucchini.   So, the texture and bite ratio of the dish fell short. The large chunks off-set the dish in a negative way. They overpower and it is unpleasant. At home we spiral cut everything, so the bite ratio is evenly dispersed and not overpowering when we're making it ourselves.  Spiral cutting also allows for a lightness to the dish and a fuller plate. We WISH SO BADLY that Green would do this! We get the feeling that vegetarian restaurants serve a bulk of carrot and zucchini to add volume to dishes at a lower cost, and we have the sneaking suspicion that vegetarians eat them this way because no other choices are offered. We take what we can get.  At the Tempe/Scottsdale location our salad (thankfully) lacked the monster carrot/zucchini overdrive. The \"big\" salad did not seem that much bigger than the \"small\" salad. We had a problem with the blackened mock chicken. First, it was overbearingly salty. Yikes. Second, it played havoc on our digestive system later. Apparently we cannot handle processed meat substitutes--but we understand that a lot of people *can*, so we're just putting this out there.  We are of the philosophy that more vegetables are key, rather than simply substituting meat. Normally we avoid all substitutions and go for an abundance of colors....avocado, very thinly sliced red cabbage, spiral-cut or grated carrots, cucumbers, zucchini, etc. This salad had none of that, other than a few tiny pieces of artichoke, which left us wondering, \"Where's the artichoke?!\" Also, the salad contained a lot of very salty, but otherwise pleasantly crunchy, gluten-free tortilla strips.  We get a sense that Green is for people who rely on substitutes, reminding us of \"french fry\" vegetarians. We'd like to see more TRULY GREEN/NUTRITIOUS/LOW SODIUM choices, with more colors. Truly. We mean, we really do. This place has so much potential and it falls short, which is sad because the two locations are surviving in a city where vegan/gluten-free/organic restaurants are hard to come by. Maybe we're going there because there aren't many places for us to go--but you can create more converts if the bites are better.  We want to go back, but we will be disappointed if we do. We'll go back a few times a year, probably, for that special sugar splurge, for sure. The people who work at both locations are cool and totally nice, and the service was good on both occasions.  This is a sad love letter to Green. We *want* to love you. And sometimes we take risks in love. So we are hoping you find it within you to take menu risks with more vegetables in smaller bites, more colors, and no substitutes because, frankly, we don't need them. Give us an abundance of clean eating with those marvelous dressings.  In short: Grate or spiralize your veggies, add MORE kinds of veggies, and cut waaaay back on the salt. Also, give us a protein free option. We will be loyal forever.",

The \"steak\" is moist, flavorful and full of spices. I can't believe it's not meat. Their peanut cole slaw is my favorite side. So good!   The parking lot is small so good luck during the lunch and dinner rush... But I've never seen it so packed that I had to drive away. I personally love sitting on either the patio out front by the sidewalk or in the back under a tree. They have excellent service and even make an attempt to remember your name if you become a frequent customer.",

I used to go to this location when it was the former restaurant \"It's A Wrap\" back in the day and I love the remodel since Green moved in the space. Parking is always hard at this location so I had to park a few businesses away and walk over. I got there a little before noon and there was already quite the line. The line moved slower than it does in Scottsdale and I ordered my Spicy Thai Chicken Salad (my favorite) and ordered it to go incase I didn't have time to finish the entire salad during my lunch hour. I'm really glad I did because by the time I got in the door, stood in line and got my order I had 10 minutes to eat my lunch. I think next time I will call my order in ahead of time so the wait is a little less and I can eat my lunch with more time to spare.   Still very good, services was good and I will be back soon.",

    "text": "Phoenix is lucky to have this place!  Vegans rejoice as the food was amazing.  I had to go there twice on my visit.  For starters, the staff is very friendly and were happy to be there.  The drinks: Great selection with some organic choices like lime/lemonade.  I mixed it all up which tasted great.  I will say that trying each individually was nice too.  I love that they have green tea as one of the options.  I did not get anything from the fridge as they had sodas and other things there.  Nice.  The food: Fries were awesome considering they were thin cut which made them crispy throughout.  Not sure if they had another options, but we got the thyme fries.  I recommend it.  Sandwiches were bomb! Big Wac - Well, if you like the Big Mac when and if you ever ate meat, this is it without the guilt or blood.  Tasted awesome and I am surprised that this was vegan since the cheese was so cheesy.  Barbeque Chicken - A big sloppy in which you may need a knife and fork to eat.  Me and my friend split it, so we just cut it in half and it oozed with sauce.  Great sauce and great sandwich.  The extra sauce is a nice dipping item for the fries for sure.  Faux Lay Of Fish - Awesome!  Since I had a fish sandwich before while I was eating the last bite, I had to make sure it was not real fish.  My friend reassured me as she is a fish eater.  I on the other hand was surprised.  We had to get it again on our second visit.  The only thing is for those going there to try this, it is a seasonal item or special.  I hope they have it when you go!  Diablo Bowl - Not bad and had great seasoning.  We had a mix of both noodles and brown rice (friends wanted that as I only wanted noodles).  That probably didn't help the dish, but in the long run, the dish had a nice flavor.  Would try again if I am ever in the area after getting one of the above beforehand though.  We also went next door to try a cake.  Although their other stuff was pretty good based on some sampling, that cake was way too sweet.  It was my mini birthday cake though, so THANK YOU for putting that candle on it!  :)  Made me extra happy.",

The food was good, not sure how they get the mock chicken to have the look and texture of what I remembered the real thing to be like.  The service however was another thing.  We ordered two Wendy's pickle sandwiches and an order of fries.  The fries came out pretty quickly a good 5-10 minutes before our sandwiches.  When I could finally get one of the food runners attention I asked about the rest of the order as well as why did she bring out the fries so soon.  The response was \"I know, we don't like it either but the kitchen just prepares the orders as they get the\".  WTH?  I told her I ordered the sandwiches the same time as the fries, shouldn't they then come together?  Her response \"sorry we have no control over the kitchen\".  Again, WTH kind of answer or logic is that for any establishment?",

The new restaurant is modern, simple and clean.  I love the decor and of course the delicious food. Healthy, cruelty-free and eco-conscious too!  It's one of the best vegan restaurants on planet earth. Okay..maybe the best one in Phoenix. Green Vegetarian is an excellent place for lunch and dinner. Without a doubt, If you are ready to become a vegetarian. This is an excellent place to start because the flavors are explosive!  I have tried pretty much everything in their menu because my friends and I frequent the one in Tempe.  However, it's too far from where we live, so we were delighted when the second location finally opened in Phoenix. I took a few pictures and posted them to show you what we ate this evening. Since I enjoyed the Singapore Tofu Noodles in Calgary today for lunch, I decided to try it again this evening in Phoenix.  My friend Boston ordered the Apricot Miso Bowl. He said it was sweet but delicious. I will be taking more pictures of course because I intend to eat here again and again.  The employees here are also very nice, polite and unobtrusive. I really love this eatery.  You don't have to be vegan of course to love this place. The dishes maybe vegetarian and vegan, but in no way restricted in its choices or flavor. Great place to get out of food rut and find your food groove!",

Staff was friendly and helpful when ordering. The food arrived quickly and hot. There are seating options inside and out. And it seems to be busy with eat-in and take-out orders at all times.

There's a small parking lot shared with Nami. You can also park around the perimeter of the building in different marked spots. The restaurant is modern and simple and comfortable.  Lots of different wines and beers available, and I would have loved to have one, but I opted for one of many different healthy flavored water drinks in the fridge by the counter. I had the Thai peanut bowl with house tofu and noodles. Sauce was spicy and delish; noodles were cooked well, and there were nice big pieces of fresh broccoli and carrots alongside perfectly done tofu. It was filling and yummy, and I did not feel depressed (from grease and calories) after eating it.  The big wac really does taste like a big mac. It looks beautiful - the way you'd hope a big mac would look, and it tastes awesome. Calexico burger was pretty good. Cole slaw is really fresh, really good, and the fries are amazing. I could eat the fries all day, every day.  I will be back! Even if you're not huge on veggie only food, this place is worth a try. If you like tofu, definitely stop in.

I can honestly say with no hesitation that in terms of good old comfort food done vegan that Green leaves every other place I've eaten at in the dust. This includes every restaurant frequented while living in Portland, OR which to many is some kind of vegan mecca.   Get the Big Wac. Best vegan burger I've ever had.",

Not too many healthy options, but if you're looking to splurge on some junk food, or convince your non-vegan friends that vegan food is fun and delicious this is the place to do it. They recently updated their menu, with that their prices went up...again. However service is pretty good and the food is delicious, creative, and filling. I often wonder why they aren't open on Sundays, especially because Sundays is the main day of the week I have the time and energy to travel to one of their two locations, but I have learned to live with it, especially supplementing with Nami and their deliciousness (see other review).  Be aware of their hours of operation and check out Sunday brunch at Nami which is served at Nami, but essentially hosted by Green.",

    "text": "Well ... based off of so many positive Yelp reviews and considering how packed the place was when I visited, I must try it again. For me, the food was only okay... perhaps I should have tried the special of the day. In fact, it was highly suggested that I try the special of the day (street tacos) but because it was my first time I wanted to try the local favorite, one of the most popular items on the menu, the buffalo chicken wings. So that's what I ordered.  I waited a very long time for just one order of buffalo wings. The buffalo sauce was amazing, but cold, so was the wings. They tasted like they've been sitting back there for a while and forgotten about. I ate 2, ate the carrots and cucumbers that accompanied the wings and left the rest of the wings there. They were cold anyway. I opted not to get a to go box because I just didn't like them very much. I imagined if I would have taken them home to heat up they would have taste worse.   The restaurant was wayyyyyy too busy for me not to give them another try. Something's gotta be good! Next time I think I'll try their version of the Big Mac",

For the most part the food has been good, but I consider it comfort food because of its heavy sauces and rich flavors. Don't get me wrong it's quite good and flavorful. But unfortunately it's been going down hill the last few years because of its smaller portions, higher prices (which don't trouble too much), but my biggest concern is the cleanliness of the place. I was just here yesterday with my good bud Jeff and man the place is in need of some MAJOR cleaning from floors needing to be machine scrubbed, air vents in the ceiling needing major cleaning, chairs are filthy, and restrooms need love. Look, I'm not bashing just sharing the concern, because let's face it, if you don't take pride in where your customers dine, sit and enjoy their food, what does the kitchen look like, eek!  I know vegan options in Phoenix are scarce, and I've been to most of them, and I don't want to criticize a place with a decent reputation, but I can't keep coming back to enjoy a good vegan meal in a dirty place. Get it cleaned up and you'll earn back my biz!  With love and respect!",

The Sesame Dragon bowl was decent but could have used more sauce or flavor (though I tend to like my stir-fry with more sauce than most). The \"thyme fries\" were OK but I didn't taste any thyme. However, the crab puffs were awesome. I don't know what kind of vegan magic goes into making them, but I highly recommend getting them! I also had green tea to drink, and it was nice that the four different teas & lemonades were all self-serve & free-refills.  I've been trying to eat vegetarian more often throughout the week and Green has been on my list of places I've wanted to try for a while. I finally was able to drag someone with me and was also pleasantly surprised that this is a casual \"order at the counter and food is brought out to you\" kind of place rather than one with waiters -- good to know for future times I may be looking for a quick bite.  The main downside was that the dining area was not very clean at the time we visited. The open tables were pretty dirty as were the floors. I also didn't notice any staff wiping off tables during the time we were there. It may have just been a freak thing and I still plan on visiting again, but this is something I'll be paying attention to.",

My favorites on the menu are the buffalo wings, the spicy chicken sandwich, and definitely the big wac, but everything so far has been amazing! My vegetarian friend didn't even eat all her chicken because it reminded her too much of real chicken. I, on the other hand, love this, because I still enjoy the taste of meat and dairy. Green gives me that satisfaction without having to give up being vegan.   Come to Green is you want delicious, cheap, junky vegan food, and make sure to stop at Nami afterward for vegan ice cream!",

The place is super cute even though I stopped here on my way to the airport so I didn't get a chance to sit down and eat.   I got their famous Big WAC, the vegan version of a Big Mac and let me tell y'all.....I side eyed questioned if it wasn't actually real meat! It tastes just like an actual Big Mac!!! But what was 10x better about it was 1- you're not eating any actual animal products, 2- there is none of that McDonalds food after taste that used to linger for hours (belching not included) and 3- you didn't get that \"omg I'm going to pass out I'm so full\" feeling after you ate it.   The Big Wac with a side of thyme fries and a berry lemonade really makes you question how important IS that flight you're about to catch. Maybe it could wait the savoring of such a surprisingly delicious HEALTHY fast food meal.   And side note, Amy fiance, a non vegan, took a bite (which turned into a few) and he himself could not believe it was actually vegan. So whether you are vegan, or not, this place is a must!!! 5 stars!!!",

The sides are very good though. My husband loves the fries, and I go for the tahini coleslaw.  One thing I wish could be tweaked is the size of the sandwich buns. It's a little too much bread  to filling ratio for me. I could be healthy and order some of the rice and veggie bowls, but I'm not going to drive all that way for such nonsense. I'm here for the vegan junk food!  Green has long been a favorite of mine. I'd go here over Coronado any day.",

The place itself is on the smaller side but there's still plenty of seating to hold 25+ people. The parking isn't the greatest and can be rather annoying when it's busy. With that being said the food is great.   They offer a \"big wac\" which is a vegan twist on the classic Big Mac burger and it's greatly done.   The buffalo wings are a real winner and you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't order them at least once.   I've tried a variety of their \"burritos\" and have yet to be disappointed. The peanut chicken burrito is my favorite. The mock meat they offer makes it very hard to even realize you're not eating the real thing. This is a great place to introduce someone to vegan food for the first time.   Be sure to order a drink and try they're house made drinks! All of them are delicious and compliment the food well.   If you still have room after the meal right next door is a vegan bakery!",

    "text": "We tried Green this past Friday night.  Yeah, we are totally fans.  A little backstory...My Wife and I have been vegan for about the last 9 months.  Our Son was out of town last week, so we decided to try a couple of new places during our \"Staycation\".  After a rather disappointing meal at another establishment just down the street, we decided to try Green on the recommendation of a server at another restaurant.  We arrived about 6:30 on Friday evening, and the first thing we discovered is that parking is not so great.  This almost made us go somewhere else, but I'm glad we didn't.  We were able to find parking on a side street and had a short walk back to the restaurant.  The restaurant was busy, but we were not deterred.  We got a menu, and got in line.  While waiting in line, I was looking around the place.  There is one main dining room with the ordering counter/drinks at the back.  Out front facing 7th Street is a nice patio, and the main room has a roll up type door for nice weather.  I also found out later, that there is a back patio that I would love try.  The place was very clean and modern; but be warned, it's loud.    While looking at the menu and deciding what to have, I was also \"window shopping\" other customers plates.  Everything I saw looked good and the portions were large.  While there was a lot of talking going on, people really seemed to be enjoying their food (a very good sign!) and not letting it sit on their plates.  Turnover was also pretty quick, people seemed to eat and go, not a lot of lingering.  My Wife and I both decided on the big WAC burger (Green's take on a popular burger from the \"golden arches\" place), thyme fries, and an order of the buffalo wings for an appetizer.  We both had iced tea to drink (there are 4 house made drinks to choose from).     While it took a little time to get our food (understandable, it was Friday night and the place was busy).  It was sooooo worth the wait.  Our burgers and fries came before our wings.  We both requested no onions, and that's how we got them.  The presentation was awesome.  The burgers and fries were hot and looked like a million bucks. The patties came to the edge of the bun, the \"cheese\" was melted, the taste was phenomenal.  The burger was huge.  The fries were crisp and not greasy.  I'm trying not to use too many exclamation points so my review doesn't get canned, but I could put them after every sentence, the food was just that good!  We both felt like we were cheating.  The only let down was the Buffalo sauce.  When our wings arrived, they looked great and smelled good.  The texture was spot on and they were sized nice, but neither of us cared for the sauce.  Maybe I'm too much of a traditionalist when it comes to wing sauce, but I would try them again.  Overall, this was a fantastic experience and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Green to anyone.  Vegan or not.  Great job Green!  4.5 stars",

It was very busy but after waiting a good 20 minutes we had to ask for our table to be wiped down as it had food remnants still on it from the previous diners. The food came out in stages with the last meal coming 50minutes after everyone else's food had arrived. Had we not had to pre-pay, we would have left. Asked to speak to the manager who was less than thrilled at hearing some criticism (hey - I get it - it's busy as heck and the service industry is not an easy one to work in - but at least act like you care.) In an annoyed tone she asked me if a gift certificate to the bakery next door would \"make it all better?\"  With all the money they're making on those delicious vegan burgers and with the place packed you'd think they would hire more staff to accommodate! That would actually \"make it all better.\"",

    "text": "this vegetarian restaurant is good but certainly not healthy. their food tends to be a little greasy at times. also, their portion sizes are extremely unfilling. i usually come and spend about $30-35 per meal just by myself with no drink, which i feel is rather a lot to pay for a date out with myself... to fill me up,  i usually order an appetizer, a large entree salad, and a bowl. their appetizers are a bit greasy and fried. their crab wontons tho obviously being vegetarian have no crab, are just fried wonton crisps stuffed with a little amount of what tastes like philadelphia cream cheese. i did not enjoy those. i do really like their mock buffalo chicken wings tho. i order those a lot. but they can get a little greasy and heavy on the stomach. their salads are decent, but i generally like my salads without the purple lettuce and often times they forget so i end up eating a full salad that is actually the size of a small side salad after half the salad is removed because it is purple... the bowls are my favorite part but they are extremely small and considering there is no meat, is very unfilling on its own, hence my additional order of an appetizer and salad. they are tasty tho! you can choose to order with rice or noodles. the noodles are tastier but makes the unfilling bowl even less filling on the stomach. so i usually get the rice. they have a great amount of sauce in their bowls and their veggies are crunchy and delicious. the ambience is nice too tho sometimes it can get loud. they have an outdoor patio too which is nice. the restaurant opens up into that patio, so it looks pretty nice. tho i have to order more than i normally would at another typical vegetarian restaurant and spend more than i would like each time i come, and have to deal with the upset stomach from all the grease and oil they use, i still come eat here every once in awhile because the food is good, and im not on a diet. they do have many things they could improve upon tho IMO...",

    "text": "My friends, who are vegans, invited me to tag a long with them one day to this restaurant. I was quite skeptical about trying the food because I'm not vegan at all, but I said what the heck I'll give it a try what can it hurt? I'm not a picky person at all when it comes to the taste of food. Anyways, I was actually very impressed with the taste of my dish, which was the kung pao with mock chicken. After my first experience, I had gone back about a total of 5 more times. The 3rd time I decided to try a new dish, the lemon pesto bowl with mock chicken (my friends favorite dish). This dish ended up turning into my favorite as well. On my 4th visit to Green,  I ordered to go, and got the lemon pesto bowl with mock chicken and requested an extra side of lemon pesto sauce. When I looked in my bag to make sure everything was in their, I noticed my lemon pesto sauce was not, so I kindly asked if I could get the lemon pesto sauce (my friend also requests an extra side of lemon pesto sauce with her order all the time and they have NEVER once forgotten to give it to her). I tried to be as understanding as possible because I know we are all human and forgot little details like that. I will honestly say I was a little irritated because I had to wait additional time for them to prepare it. On my 5th visit, same thing,  they forgot my pesto sauce AGAIN. I was thoroughly irritated because I just didn't get how they could forget a second time after I had specifically requested for the side and the cashier even verbally repeated my order . AGAIN I had to wait for the pesto sauce to be prepared . I decided to give this place another try because I became addicted to the lemon pesto bowl (my 6th visit). I ordered the same thing over the phone, to go. Mind you, they always verify my whole order before hanging up. When I picked up my order and paid, I checked the bag to make sure my pesto sauce was in there.... and once AGAIN my pesto sauce was not in there!! Bitting my tongue I asked the cashier if I could get an extra side of pesto sauce because it wasn't in my bag. The cashier told the people in the back to prepare some.. After waiting patiently about 5 minutes I asked one of the servers walking around if she could check up on my pesto sauce because I was still waiting. She went to the back and came back with the sauce. I left and headed home. When I got home and was getting ready to eat my dish I noticed they had forgotten to add the mock chicken (the best part of it)! I was so freakin pissed because here they had forgotten my pesto sauce for the 3rd damn time and now they forgot my mock chicken! I was extremely irritated that I felt compelled to call and let them know. When I called, I explained to the girl that answered the phone that I was just in there, and I now just noticed that my mock chicken was missing (I didn't bring up the missing pesto sauce) She proceeded to apologize and asked if I would like to come back to get the chicken. I told her I'm already at home (what I was thinking in my head: I live 30 mins away their is no way in hell I would waste gas just to go all the way back to get the remaining portion of my order that you guys screwed up on). After a couple seconds of awkward silence, the girl was unsure what to even do to solve the problem and put me on hold so she could ask a coworker what to do? Really? She acted like she had never received a phone call before about an incomplete order. I've worked in the food industry in customer service so I found it to be very strange that she had to ask another coworker what to do. Maybe she was new? Idk. Anyways after waiting on hold, she came back and told me that her manager wasn't in today and that she would take down my info so he/she could call me the next day to maybe set me up with a gift card for the chicken they had forgot. Which I was totally fine with, all I wanted was the chicken that they had forgotten, that I paid for. The next day came and I never received a phone call from anyone.  I was very surprised that no one called especially with all the good reviews on Yelp, I really thought highly of Green. I was so disappointed with the whole situation and previous experiences with my order that I told myself I'm done with this place. I truly enjoyed the food, but after so many screw ups I gave up and told my friends that I won't be returning. It's just a big headache and a waste of time. Maybe I should have spoken up the first time they forgot, and not have been so polite....but that is not the type of person who I am. I try to be as patient as possible. This is my first time writing a review on anything, sorry it wasn't a good one.",

This place is so close to my work that I was able try it. The first time, I had their buffalo wings and an apricot noodle dish. Their take on ranch dressing with cucumber is a to-die-for concoction. What I wouldn't give to be swimming in that. Soooo good. They need to bottle that. NOW. The buffalo wings really tasted like what you'd get in a sports bar but they were a little salty for my taste. Another time I had the vegetarian chili fries. Very authentic tasting also. The faux-cheese was meh. But it went well with the fries. Another winner is their green chile hummus with the fried pita chips. I would love to work my way through the whole menu. I also like the decor of woods and recycled materials. So far, I haven't found much to complain about. If you're going to pick up to-go, definitely call ahead first. Also, parking can be tight; you may have to risk parking at Coco's. Still, I'm all for going 'green'!",

I have eaten everything on the menu, and there is not a single thing on it I wouldn't order again, which I cannot say for any other eatery in the Valley.  But if I had to suggest something to a meat-eater that is venturing out into unknown territory, I would recommend \"Thee Argentine Po Boy\".    If you were raised by American McDonald's junkies like myself, and you are trying to change your eating habits, and you love to eat that ice cream cone after your McFeast, then feel free to hoof it over to Nami next door and satisfy the sweet tooth as well.  Thank you Green for making me feel a little less 1950's America in a ever-evolving world.",

Feels a little less pretentious, a little more grown-up, and hopping next door to Nami for a Tsoynami and vegan dessert is unbeatable.  I love everything on the menu and have always been impressed by the prices. Whether you're vegan/vegetarian or not, GO. I have brought several friends who are meat eaters and have since been back with them on countless occasions. The options are overwhelming. Their mock meat is incredible and all of their noodle dishes are loaded with an abundant variety of fresh vegetables. Great for a healthy lunch or dinner with friends.  Even if you're not big on the food -- give soy soft serve a try and pop next door for a Tsoynami (Green's vegan version of a McFlurry or DQ's Blizzard). There are so many flavor options and they are all PHENOMENAL.  No doubt if you try once you'll be back for more.",

    "text": "This was my very first visit to a vegan restaurant. I was so thrilled to come here, I couldn't contain myself. The employees were nice, but they were busy. The people in the restaurant seemed a bit snobby, but I shouldn't care about them anyway. I am there to eat, not make friends.   I was overwhelmed with choices. I went for the buffalo wings and the spicy chicken po' boy sandwich. My boyfriend got the Green Veggie Burger, and his sister got the no-harm chicken parm. We are vegan, she is not.  The wings were by far my favorite! I think I will order them as a meal or to share though. Some reviews said the portion was small, but I couldn't finish them despite how delicious they were. My sandwich was pleasantly messy and delicious. The texture is truly fabulous as far as faux meat goes. Don't come here expecting gardein textures and flavors - it is the best of the best!   A lot of people said it was greasy and oily. I am familiar with a low-fat diet and usually eat as low-fat as possible. Even though this is not health food (unless you get the healthier options), it doesn't feel heavy or disgusting like traditional SAD food does. There is a noticeable difference. The salt level could be taken down a notch, but other than that, this food is AMAZING.   After going to Vegas and trying vegan food at restaurants here, Green is still winning as far as value and quality goes. I can't wait to go back, and Green will certainly be on my mind for awhile.",

I was there last weekend and had their mock buffalo chicken sandwich and it was messy but great. They use a great bread for the roll and it comes out literally burning hot so wait 2 or 3 minutes before you dig in and have plenty of napkins. They also do a variety of vegi and mock meat stir fries that I've had at their other location and though I've not had them their vegi burgers look amazing.  Parking can be a bit of an issue if it is busy but the place draws a wonderful eclectic crowd, sort of the same group that you might say, see at a showing of an independent film. Oh, and I especially like the fresh teas, lemonade, and  ginger drink that they have available and the ice maker has a wrap around of face pictures of the rapper ice cube, how cool is that baby!  I hope that one day they open another location near Mill avenue, I think it would do well and I would eat there on a much more regular basis!   Bottom line, give it a try and the other thing, the boneless mock chicken buffalo wings, good stuff!",

    "text": "I gave Green a chance after banning it from my already incredibly small list of vegan friendly restaurants. I was shocked at how expensive everything was for such small portions. $7 for four samosas? Maybe you could fool some people who are vacationing in veganism but it's not going to fly with me.  The food was fair. Just fair. The sauce for my samosas was almost disgustingly sweet (no chutney?). It took a ridiculously long time to get my main meal out and I was disappointed to find that it was /really/ greasy. I understand that the point of Green is comfort food but excuse me if a quarter cup of grease just makes me sick.  After dinner we popped over to Nomi where I tried the BFs twinkie which had an incredibly dry cake and unfathomably greasy cream (which I think has more to do with how long it had been out and how they decided to store the cakes rather than how it was made).  The only good part of this time's visit was that I could stomach the food. Last time I went there I had a lemon slice on my freaking pizza. Who the hell puts lemon on a pizza??  I don't think I'll be going back. If I want Asian food I'll go to Loving Hut otherwise I'll be making things myself. It's not worth the price nor the taste to be ignored while surrounded by artsy fart \"hollier than thou\" attitudes among fellow vegans.",

I had to try the vegan chili and it was amazing as well, I wish they sold this in grocery stores so I could eat it all the time.

Clean chill restaurant with alot of personality and im all about supporting vegan restaurants. The big wac is my favorite but this time i got the bbq wings salad with a tangy ranch dressing and crispy tortilla chips. Light but filling, veggies were fresh and wings had lots of flavor. I think ill do the wings in buffalo sauce next time though, i think it would go better with the dressing. I sat out back on the patio under the tree and it was pretty relaxing.also, love the varieties of house made ice teas! I mixed some of the sweet ginger tea with some lemonade and dangggg, so refreshing! I will be back as always! Cant wait to try something different next time.",

The last menu change seems to have put more emphasis on the comfort-food. I miss the green burger greatly. If I'm not mistaken, it was a hand-packed patty made from oats, beets and sundry seasonings. It was delicious and didn't make me feel like a pig for eating it. The newer burgers - while good comfort food - are not something I care to eat when I'm not depressed or too tired to cook.  2. The management seems to hire employees based on their number of facial piercings and overall devil-may-care fashion sense rather than friendliness, helpfulness and other attributes of a True customer-service professional. There are some very nice employees, but the lazy ones who behave as though they're doing you a favor by showing up to work have put a damper on many experiences for people I know.",

Such a cute peaceful outside patio and the best vegan \"meat\" I've ever had in my life, great drinks, super friendly service. I'm not kidding when I say I will be flying back to Phoenix specifically for this food.",

What a different interior than the other; a lot more upscale looking, a nice patio, good beer selection.  But no big fat ice cream bar?  Or maybe I just wasn't looking hard enough.  Ah well, I just wanted good, not desert.  Went with the Big WAC (second time having this) and buffalo wings.  Damn, eating that Big Wac makes me feel like a kid again.  So freakin' delicious.  And they have Teese vegan cheese you can switch out for Daiya (which I eat all the time).  Sweet!    My companion enjoyed his huge chili dogs and we split the wings, loved em.  What a great ranch sauce.    I'd be here all the time (other location too) if I lived in the area.",

This Green location is very airy and pleasant.  On nice days the garage door in front is opened up so the whole restaurant seems like a patio.  The staff are friendly and orders come up in a timely manner.  The parking lot is quite tiny so sometimes it's tough to find a space, but it's worth the wait!    Today for lunch I tried the ranchero salad.  The salad features Green's famed \"wings,\" which I learned today are made from mock beef, not mock chicken.  The restaurant happened to be out of the \"beef,\"  and I was asked if \"chicken\" would be okay.  Silly me thought that wings would be made of faux chicken anyway!  I'm not sure what they taste like when made with \"beef\" but I really enjoyed the \"chicken\" version.  The salad also has a vegan version of ranch dressing which sort of tasted pesto-y to me, but was cool and refreshing just like non-vegan ranch but without that heavy, artery-clogging feeling.  Yum!  I've also had tried the secret BBQ chicken sandwich.  This seems to be quite a popular item, but I thought the \"chicken\" in this dish was chewy and hard to bite through.  The sandwich was also messy to eat because it had tons of sauce on it.  The sauce is fantastic though.  Just get lots of napkins.  I particularly like the Green burger and addictive thyme fries.  The apricot miso noodle bowl really surprised me.  Lots of sweet and subtle flavors.  Green is an excellent place to come for a late afternoon lunch.  I think even people who are hardcore carnivores can find something to enjoy here.",

I recommend them. Then today I went for their Sunday brunch and had their vegan biscuits and gravy and a chocolate peanut butter crunch donut. The biscuits and gravy had great flavor and I really liked the tofu scramble and potatoes that came with it. Their tofu scramble has a better texture and flavor than most that I've tried. The meal wasn't hot when I got it - in fact it was almost getting cold. The donut was gluten free (I don't require a gluten free diet; it just happened to be) and I got it because it was smaller than their \"main selection\" of donuts which are all very large. The donut was like a very moist chocolate cake donut- very little to no peanut butter flavor and no crunch- that did not bother me at all because it was still really good. I can't wait to go back!!!",

The staff consists of a crew of heavily pierced and tattooed alt-hipsters, who are typically very helpful and pleasant. They are always willing to explain a menu item. I've taken lots of non-vegetarians there and most have wanted to return.   Their buffalo wings are the best to be had in Phoenix, hands down. I love the \"Original G Po Boy,\" which features the buffalo wings front and center. And the thyme fries, oh jeezus. I tend to stick with the sandwiches, and I've never had anything I didn't like.  The ambiance is great, too. In cooler weather, they roll up the delivery door, which opens up a full wall of the restaurant to the outside world. It's nice sitting in the clean, modern setting while overlooking the 7th street traffic. Very urban and cool. The artwork, which is in constant rotation, is also something to be seen. I loved the NWA-themed stuff they had when they opened.   Excellent food, excellent experience.",

    "text": "Whoot! Finally an awesome veggie place that serves tasty mock meat and alternative fooooodddssss! I lament the fact that Vegas, which is a major city as well, doesn't have anything even close to this place.  First off, the serve every vegan, vegetarian and organic eater alike, and the food is GOOD! So good, even my carnivore boyfriend liked it. I got the Thai Orange bowl with mock chicken, and he got the No Harm Parm chicken Po'boy. The Thai bowl seemed to be very popular since I saw nearly half the people in there with it, and it was very good, full of fresh veggies cooked perfectly and not at all soggy, with a semi-spicy sauce to die for, but only a few pieces of mock chicken. His meal, however, with the giant Po'boy and tasty potato tots was fricken AWESOME. I tasted his mock breaded chicken and nearly cried. It was like a biscuit covered in country gravy and soooo moist.  They have really cool alternative sodas and organic lemonades- I got my favorite Zevia cherry cola and he got the cup (which you can go and choose from three lemonades, endlessly) and got the organic berry lemonade. The place is really cool too, but kinda hard to find if you have never been there, only because it is so laid back and not \"HERE WE ARE VEGGIES\". It's sign is very dark, but no worries, just remember it is right by Coco's. Parking is very tight, so I advise to park either at Coco's, or down the side street by Coco's in the residential neighborhood and walk.",

I walked in here tonight and my heart filled with happiness to see so many people here embracing the vegan lifestyle, after all peace begins on our plates!!!  Everything I have tried here is delicious....from comfort food with their burgers and fries to their bowls, delicious specials, salads and appetizers. Big wac is definitely a go to when I want something \" bad\" .  I have taken both my carnivore hubby and child here in the past ( but they both are now vegetarians ~ by choice.....yeah !!! Still hoping they convert though to all plant based diet though )And they even loved it then when they consumed meat.  You order your food at the counter, they give you a number and they bring your food out to you. Outdoor seating as well, both in the front or the back of the restaurant . Friendly staff and I cant forget about the desserts next door.....omg....nights on 7th Ave are made for vegan foodies !!!!   I do have to warn you....parking can sometimes be a challenge but the meal is soooooo worth it !!!!",

We want to order a platter for our next football Sunday!   The rest of our meal was still great. The Big Wac was very filling and the BBQ sauce on the Sammie was to die for (vinegary and sweet and smoky). Animal fries were a good side but I'm sure we would've been happy with any of the others!  Can't wait to come back! Also, the service was great and staff were patient and helpful. :)",

She and I decided to order food to go since I had just flown into town, she had just gotten off of work, and we were both a bit tired and wanted to get to her place, eat our dinner, then crash for the night.  Didn't take very long for us to receive our order (wasn't busy), which was good. Small inside, but nice atmosphere, and pleasant, helpful servers.  I ordered the artichoke chicken salad and paid $2 to have avocado added to my salad, and it was AMAZING! Very filling.  If I had not known any better, I would have thought that the \"un-chicken\" was real chicken.  Only downside is parking, which is why I gave the place four stars.  My friend had to park in an adjacent lot, which was dark, and at night, regardless of the neighborhood, it's always best to park in a well-lit area. Need to improve on that if possible.  Otherwise, I will definitely go here again when I am back in town.",

Sometimes, we have to park at nearby business just to get in here. So, be forewarned, you may have to squeeze into a narrow parking lot to get in.  However, when you do manage to get in here, you will be well pleased with the menu. Some dishes are fairly original, and some are variations on a standard. But, so far, we haven't really been disappointed with anything that we have tried.  For starters, we often order the spicy buffalo wings (wings? I thought this was a vegan/vegetarian place), or the green hummus. Both are delicious.  For the entrees, the spicy peanut chicken salad, or the Big WAC are some of their standard and well executed.  For drinks, and this is probably one of the plusses of coming here, the Vimto juice is just such a wonderful departure from the ordinary. It's a combination of grapes, raspberries, and black currants and is wonderfully mild on the pallete. Normally, each one of these fruits can be quite overwhelming by themselves, but in this iteration @ Greens, it is quite a mild and satisfying combination.  And the service is friendly and efficient. It's not a very big place, and it is easy to miss down 7th street, but it is worth stopping by if you are in the area and want to try something different.",

I wish the sauce was gooey and nicely glazed on the wings, but it was runny and the wings were just sitting in a pool.   As for the burger, this was the best vegan burger I have ever had. The patty was the closest to taste and consistency to a real beef patty. BUT, I was so disappointed with the \"secret sauce.\" I could barely taste anything AND my burger barely had any sauce in it. The thing I detest the most is a dry sandwich. This burger falls short from perfection because of the flavorless sauce and the lack of sauce.",

    "text": "I appreciate Green for what's it's worth. Vegan fast food that hits the spot for the junk food craving. Slightly over priced for non organic processed food and never in the three years I've been going has there been any great service. They are always in a rush and rude due to being packed most days. The parking lot is a living nightmare when it's busy. So much use of soy, not great for people with intolerances. I've had friends become sick after eating here, I don't know if it's from things being too greasy or too much processed junk. The Big Wac and fries (taste like the real thing) I must say are incredible, but everything else is lack luster including the \"BFF\", with very little flavor. I'm happy they cater to vegan community and even non vegans who can't believe it's all vegan. I just remember the experience was better before they raised their prices and I was new to the area.",

This was not the case here. I'm seriously thinking about flying back to Phoenix just for this place.   I basically did a tasting and ordered the Big Wac (so amazing - totally had that \"mouth feel\" we're searching for), the Wendy's Pickle (a little fake meat taste to be honest), the buffalo wings (spicy for my taste but still good) and the vegan chili which will soon become a late night snack.   Couldn't eat it all in one sitting of course, but had to try it! This was a Postmates delivery, so I'm sure it would have been even better at the restaurant itself.   Don't cheat yourself - visit here!",

    "text": "Best vegetarian restaurant I have ever been to but weigh that with the fact that this is the first one I have visited.  :) I have wanted to try this joint for some time given they carry their version of a Big Mac, called the Big Wac and if I am going to try vegetarian I wanted to be doing it eating a Big Wac. In addition to my first visit, I brought my 74 year old father who also has never had a vegetarian meal and thought it would be fun for him to. As for our food experience, wow, if that was vegetarian grub, I am now officially a vegetarian. Everything we had was on point. The spicy wings were awesome. The sauce for the wings was what made it stand out. So flavorful. As for our Big Wacs, oh and with the thyme fries of course, it was a tasty meal.  Now don't get me wrong, it does not surpass the Mac as the flavor of real meat does carry weight but our Wacs were darn good. Tasty and as close to a Mac as one could ask. Could of used a little more sauce, if I am being picky. Overall, a real nice meal with a slightly higher price point. That seems to be par for the course though when eating anything that is slightly better for you. Will have another Big Wac in the future for sure.",

Not your typical natural food salad bar fair. The chef put thought engineering the menu. This place is always busy and I am not surprised. I think you folks should be looking to open a new branch in North Scottsdale !  My only suggestion is to have a counter space for online order pick-up so we don't have to stand in line. You are doing so well that there is a line and usually just one cashier who takes order and answer phone calls. It's hard to expect this one person to tend to pick-ups.",

Would definitely come back and try other menu items.",

    "text": "Ive been to Nami and thought it was awesome. But I never had the chance to try Green until now.    I tried a good amount of things and highlight all the details below.    Jamaican Bowl Thing - Super fresh, brussel sprouts were fried just right. The sauce they use was a low toned sweetness that wasnt overbearing. The vinaigrette was a little too powerful in the first few bites, but subsided immediately after.    The crab ragoons were a freak of nature. Its hard to believe that it wasnt cream cheese or imitation crab fr that matter. It didnt necessarily have the fishy taste of the sea, but it was damn close. The sauce they give with it tasted like au jus! I could have ate a boatload of those things.   The samosas were a solid option. They weren't as crispy as I like, but they had some flakiness, as well as a nice overall mouth-feel with the grease. Oddly enough, I wish the containers of dipping sauce were wider, as I had to break the samosa down for it to fit.    The chameleon taco had a great, bold flavor. I thought of it as a southwest flavor, even though I dont think thats what they were going for. The tempura batter taste was spot on for what you would expect on a piece of chicken. The eggplant and sweet potato are already soft, so they spill out of the tortilla fairly easily. As long as you eat this carefully, its worth getting.    They serve fresh fruit that tastes great, but I m annoyed that they only gave me pineapple and grapes. Im not asking for the Chiquita banana hat in my bowl, but Im expecting some type of variety. Maybe if they listed what fruits were actually available, I wouldn't have been as perturbed.   Overall, I was quite excited with what I had. I feel this establishment is a not-so-hidden gem of the community.",

    "text": "It should be said that not all vegetarian and vegan food is necessarily healthy.  Sure, a lot of folks adopt veganism or vegetarianism for the health benefits.  But even meatless foods can have junk food appeal.  Perhaps you're scared of going vegetarian and want to try something that tastes just like your favorite chicken wings.  Or perhaps you're already vegetarian, but you're craving a great All-American burger but without the burger patty guilt.  For those of you who've never been to Green, take it from this carnivore.  This is the place to get your junk food fix (and a few healthy fixes as well).  Truth be told I've been to Green a number of times.  The menu has changed a little here and there, but the core of Green's appeal remains the same.  A place where vegan and vegetarian foods can be creatively woven to mimic the foods we all know and love, pushing the boundaries of what vegetables can do.  At first glance it would seem hilariously out of place to see items like a burger, or a cheesesteak or buffalo wings while perusing the menu of a vegetarian restaurant.  But for owner and head chef Damon Brasch, that's the whole point.  Opening the public's eyes to whats possible to construct with creativity and an almost religious devotion to avoiding meat and meat byproducts.  I've had a number of items on the menu in the past including the Buffalo Wings, the Chili Cheese Fries, and even the Crab Puffs.  All vegan, all surprising, all quite tasty.  For tonight's visit with the Yelp Veg Curious UYE crew, I decided to attack an item I had yet to tackle.  You've all heard of the Big Mac (two all beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, on a sesame seed bun).  Wait till you get a load of the Big Wac.  Same basic recipe, but the patties?  Yup, vegan.  To make it an All-American meal I went with their Thyme Fries on the side and one of their house made lemonades.  Total cost including tax came to about $15.  I would invite any longtime McDonald's Big Mac fan to try the Big Wac and point out any truly noticeable differences in the texture of Green's version of this American food icon.  As with the rest of Green's menu, you find yourself perplexed at how they can make a vegan version of these dishes taste like the genuine article.  To this day I don't know how they make the Buffalo Wings taste like legit chicken, or how they mimic the crab so accurately.  All I can say is Chef Brasch has incredible imagination.  Some dishes I've had here are better than others of course, but even those that fall short are not for lack of creativity.  So if you're among the flocks of those steering clear of meat but want the closest approximation to a meat menu you can find, you'd be hard pressed to find many places in the valley of sun that can accomplish that fete the way Green has.  The prices for the food are also quite reasonable, and the restaurant itself is a pretty cool spot on 7th Street (just be aware parking can be a bit of pain as many Yelpers have noted).  When you do come here, be sure to save room for dessert next door at Green's sister restaurant Nami.  And if you're a suspicious carnivore coming here for the first time as I once was, prepare to be confused, surprised, and delighted.  And most importantly, full.",

When I came in, I was welcomed with a very hip vibe, streamlined decor, and wonderful chalk boards filled with local brews, wine, and drink specials. Everything on the menu is vegan. They took the time and care to recreate fast food classics en vegan, so that the same cravings can be placated when we have that hit for a quick bite from a place like Wendy's or McDonald's.They have West Coast fries, flavored with thyme and smothered in vegan cheese, vegan 1k dressing, and onions at around $5.50. My main was the Sesame Dragon sauteed carrots, broccoli, house tofu, scallions, and cabbage all over rice and served with a lime. The amount of food is plenty for the price of $9.50, so come in with an empty stomach, and have a good time filling up. None of the guilt. All of the flavors. Non-alcoholic drinks are self-serve, but the quality is through the roof--I would strongly suggest the strawberry lemonade! Oh, and their partnership with Nami is awesome---I went over there to get a Tazmanian cupcake and a chunky Samoan square, too! Please, if you have a chance, come on in, and get down with some great vegan loving! I'm coming back for more!!",

I expected (per norm in most places) corners to be cut where not noticeable (see: frying something often masks it's lack of freshness) - corners were not cut.  The three things ordered were all well prepared, fresh and delicious.  The things I oversaw on other tables were also looking mighty tasty.  I'd love to see a few bottles of craft beer here - that's my personal opinion.  Part of the issue is local laws, the other part is those running the show.  Will return, for sure.",

The atmosphere is trendy and fun, right in line with the food.  The staff and the other customers all seemed friendly, even the biker-dude eating on the patio.

If you are more health conscious, you can get a bowl of steamed veggies in various sauces from the bowls section of their menu. They do offer an organic tofu option if you are concerned about GMOs. Just ask for the \"fresh\" tofu. If you are not worried about health, everything here is delicious. The chicken wings are great. Not very chicken-wing-like; more like like little soy nuggets drowning in spicy sauce with a side of ranch. Super yummy. The artichoke gratine is amazing, also spicy. The chili fries are just ok IMO; their ranch is amazing though. Next time I would just get the fries with ranch to dip them in. Seriously the best vegan ranch I've ever tasted. I could go on and on because I ate practically everything while I was here. It's all good, you guys. I love that their water is room temperature. The people who work here are super friendly and helpful. The restrooms are great. You may be tempted to sit on the front or back patio in the evening because the weather is nice and they keep it pretty cold inside, but being eaten alive by mosquitoes is not worth it.

Thai Peanut Bowl and the Singapore Orange Bowl for food on recommendation of the cashier.  Very excited to be there and I tipped the cashier nicely upon ordering because she was so helpful with menu recommendations.  I'm not sure what was wrong with the kitchen, but the Spicy Buffalo Wings and the Singapore Orange Bowl were unexpectedly very seriously oversalty, to the point of inedibility.  The other two items were quite excellent, the samosas were crispy and fluffy, and the Thai Peanut Bowl was very good, so I think the other people's five star ratings are probably spot on for their dishes.  I'd forgive them the inedible dishes, except when my companion complained about the oversalty dishes, our complaints were treated quite poorly.  My companion then asked for some rice to cut the salt, but were told we would have to buy extra rice, which my companion did... it did not help.  I asked that at least the chef be informed or that someone check our complaints..., no one.   Maybe it was the cashier, I'm not sure; I felt that our complaints were not taken seriously, and we did not finish the inedible (oversalted) portions of the meal and I left hungry.  While I would understand why people go there, it was an unsatisfying, and the complaint service was seriously lacking.",

    "text": "Walked in after 5 minutes of trying to find parking and dealing with traffic.  My 4 year old son had a yogurt with him and left it on the table. The lady that was cleaning the tables got it and almost threw it out before my husband walked up to her to let her know it was ours. She looked at my husband and handed it to him as if she was disgusted with it and said \"If it's not vegan it's not allowed in here\". Really?!   We just walked out.  Horrible!  So if someone walks in with leather shoes or a purse they'll also be kicked out or is it just food. Kind of a double standard there if you ask me.",

I LOVE that all the cups and silverware is biodegradable. Their Nami desserts are also delicious.  I very much prefer their San Fran location as there is far more parking and more room inside but either location deserves a happy 5 stars!",

    "text": "In a nutshell, Green Restaurant serves fantastic vegan meals that I sorely wish were back in my city of Oakland. Looking at the selections of entrees and sides, it feels just like an all-American diner- but without the stinky grease! You walk into this place and it does not at all feel like a cheap place to get your fix of fries and burgers. Such a good vibe!  You walk up the counter, place your order, and then barely get to wait, as it comes out to you rather quickly. There is also a refrigerator that stocks some bottles of kombucha- you know, just to fill out your vegan dinner checklist!  This great feeling, for me, is exemplified in the Po' Boy sammie. The mock chicken was so meaty and filling that I was astounded it was meatless! The buffalo sauce was just the right combination of spice and heat. Makes my mouth water right now just recalling that delicious sandwich.  I found the prices to be a tad higher than I would expect, BUT I would whole-heartedly support a vegan restaurant instead of a traditional American joint.",

The favorite at the table was the Karma Curry Rice Bowl which had crunchy vegetables and soft/dense fried tofu pieces.  Everything was very rich and flavorful, not the stereotypical vegetarian blandness that most would expect.  Also, for vegetarian food, this place is quite affordable!  Would definitely return to try other things on their menu!",

However, the last few times I have been here the service has really gone down hill. Tonight I ordered at 8:15pm, then sat at a table to wait for my food. Several other people came in after me, ordered, then had a seat. I got my wings at 8:35pm. I started eating then started to notice that the people who came in after me started getting their Big Wac sandwiches BEFORE me. I counted 5 other people who got there sandwich before I did who ordered LONG AFTER I did. Finally at 8:55pm I got my sandwich. It took them a full 40 minutes to get me my sandwich and 20 minutes after my wings.        This is HORRIBLE customer service!! The girl who brought me my sandwich knew I wasn't happy and she did apologize. What I don't understand is, why did several other people get the same sandwich BEFORE me when they ordered AFTER me?        I really do hope they don't keep going the way they have been. By reading other reviews it looks like I'm not the only one having this problem. If you're reading this Green, please fix this problem. If you don't, you could ruin a really good thing.",

    "text": "I never knew how exceptionally good vegetarian food could be until I had it here.  They truly knocked it out of the park, for me.  One key trait that separates a great restaurant from an average one is whether they are consistent.  And my dining experience here demonstrated that.  I've swung by here for lunch and brunch on separate occasions.  During my first time, I took a stab in the dark and went for their Thai Noodles with \"Chicken.\"  Boy, did I order right.  The noodles were perfectly cooked al dente! The \"chicken\" had great texture and taste.  The veggies were cooked firmly and evenly.  The freshness of all the ingredients made the biggest difference!  The sauce that glazed all over was on point! Everything was balanced nicely.    As for brunch, the fiancee had their \"eggs\" Benedict and I had the breakfast burrito.  The Benedict was just okay, we thought.  The \"ham\" that came in it was on the rubbery side.  The burrito was definitely much better.  What stood out from both dishes was the \"egg.\" Although it didn't quite taste like an ordinary egg, it certainly appeared like one given the texture and color.  The tortilla tasted non-gluten while the potatoes and \"sausage\" were cooked nicely.    I wish I lived closer as I would frequent more often.  I certainly hope they expand.  This is truly a hidden gem in my book.  7th St. & McDowell Rd is not known for being a food area but a trip here is definitely worth it.  Parking can be challenging, so if you can't find one, go into the neighborhoods on the south side and park on the dirt lot (you can't miss it) or by the curb.  It is minutes away from Downtown and the I-10 freeway.",

I was super excited, because traveling and veganism don't often go well together unless you meal/snack prep for your road trip (which I obviously didn't).   I was extremely disappointed.  First of all, the girl that was working the cash register that day is probably a master of resting bitch face. I went up to order, said \"Hi\" and she just stared at me without saying anything. Even when I asked her a question, she grunted. There was barely any interaction between us, she was your typical emo-vegan-Urban Outfitter clad hipster. Okay, that's probably not fair of me, but she really pissed me off.  Furthermore, a lady came in while I was ordering claiming that she left her car keys or something at the counter. Resting bitch face girl couldn't be bothered.   OKAY, enough ranting about customer service.   Food.  I got the Thee Green Salad, and my husband got the No Harm Chicken Parm Po-Boy. My husband took a bite of his sandwich and didn't eat the rest. But I'm not a fan of vegan, imitation meat, so I'm not surprised.  My salad was boring, they were pretty stingy with everything but the \"fresh greens\". Plus, I asked for no tortilla strips, but there they were...  Blehhhhh.",

    "text": "Hmmmm I have been hesitating to write this review because I want to like this restaurant. I want to like it so much. I just love having a dining option that has ingredients that I recognize. I have eaten here three times. Each time my food has tasted completely different. I ordered the Singapore orange rice bowl twice. The very first time I got it the tofu was cooked perfectly but the vegetables were horrifically overcooked and were the same quality as the generic frozen vegetables I can get at my local Fry's.... The second time I ate there I had the Wendy's pickle. The sandwich was not disappointing per se but the mock chicken patty was too big. I don't know how to explain precisely what it felt like biting into it. If Green is trying to re-create a chicken patty using texturized soy protein etc. etc. then they're missing the part where the patty needs to not be large... This sandwich would've been perfect if the patty had been exactly half the size it is. The second time I ate the Singapore orange dish (which would've been my third visit to green) the sauce was so salty-the sauce tasted like they had made the sauce out of soy sauce than reduced it and then added more soy sauce and then salted it. The tofu was perfectly cooked again and this time the vegetables appeared to be fresh vegetables and they were cooked perfectly crisp tender. Had I not had the sauce the dish would've been perfect. I really like the idea of this of this restaurant however when you look at the menu and compare what's on the menu to the food there is a distinct discrepancy. Either the owner isn't being honest or the general manager can't keep a consistent staff in the kitchen. Until something changes I will just take my business elsewhere or make my own version of Singapore Orange at my house.",

I had a Big Wac here and honestly no vegan burger has ever been able to stand up to it! It was literally perfect. I have tried several versions of vegan big macs and none compare to it! The fries were also amazing. I seriously consider going back to Phoenix just to go here to eat!!",

The people that work here are very nice and I could hear the cooks singing which made me laugh. I also like that they seemed very quick to clean the vacant tables (nothing is grosser than a dirty table, well maybe two dirty tables). One thing I will say is that the music was a bit to loud for me but I'm sure they would have turned it down if I asked.",

I take comfort knowing everything is vegan and there's no contamination of meat stocks etc.. hiding in my food, I have had experiences at other places where I find a random piece of meat in my food! Not here!!! The food is consistently good and the service is always great! Can't say enough good things about this place!",

I had 3 days to plan a small get together for my best friend's wedding reception.  It was happening at the courthouse and I wasn't going to let her get married without a party.  Since both she and I share similar food allergies, choosing Green was a no-brainer, especially since I could order a cake from Nami next door and have it delivered.  We ordered some appetizers (which were promptly eaten) and Jeanette was so incredible to work with.  The staff at Green and Nami really helped to pull together what might have been an empty evening into a wonderful celebration for my best friend and all of her old and new family. Thank you so very much Green for making it possible on such short notice! BTW, on a side note, their chicken enchilada nachos (which was the special that night) were positively amazing.  The food is top notch each time I visit.",

I think this proves the point that JUST BECAUSE ITS VEGAN DOESN'T MEAN ITS HEALTHY!!  I wish Green had healthier and freshier options.  Maybe some kind of local quinoa salad?  Interesting daily soups? Their salads are pretty pathetic, with their \"mixed greens\" resembling something that came out of a bag from Fry's.  However, Green IS delicious.  I would classify their hot wings as one of  my favorite foods ever, and I am always very happy whilst eating their creations.",

The downtown Phoenix location is even better than the Tempe one with Nami, the bakery right across the street. Service has always been good when I've been in as well. Even if you're not vegan/vegetarian you should stop in.",
