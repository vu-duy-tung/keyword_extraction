Not attentive (restaurant wasn't busy) 2. Forgetting orders (ordered a salad and she never brought it)  3. Laziness, which she spent 20 minutes cleaning one small table which just needed whipped down 4. Took forever to return my credit card  5. I asked for a drink almost 20 minutes later \"sorry we dont have it, bad batch\"   Things she did well.  1. Got our drinks right   If you are to go to this restaurant  Don't let her serve you, she was pleasant with a passive aggressive attitude.   Ive been in the food service industry for years, and it seems to me this server didn't care about her job.",

The service was painfully slow, the bartender, an older guy, was not interested in waiting on us, he was more interested in washing glasses.  We ordered the deep dish pizza, gourmet 5 meat pizza, wings and boneless wings.  Both wings were terrible, cold, hardly any flavor or sauce.  I failed to mention we also ordered Mediterranean chicken tacos which never came.  We all had belly aches on the way home.  This place sucks, TGIFridays is better and that's not saying much!",

I was starving and the place was packed and I didn't feel like waiting for them to fix it. Not the best experience to say the least!!",

    "text": "2.5  It hurts my heart to write this because I went here three days after its grand opening and everything was amazing.  The food was great. The service was honestly the best I can remember having at a restaurant.  I ordered their Asian salad and the chicken was cooked to perfection  I came back on Monday of this week during lunchtime to meet my family for a quick meal.  My quick meal ended up taking over an hour and a half for a total order of: 2 unlimited soup and salad meals, the santa fe salad, and my brother got some type of chicken dish.  Aside from the fact that they have one group of people waiting on tables and another group running the food and that is clearly extremely confusing and only causes more issues than productivity, I think the entire process needs a review.  I think their way of trying to be efficient having people designated to sections & tasks in this huge place is more negative than it is positive.  I won't get into details, but my parents' soups and salads were coming out in doubles without spoons, our waiter was nowhere to be found for a period of time, three different people brought out the orders.  It was just chaos.  My brother and mom had also been here on two separate previous times within a week and had the exact same issue with the confusion.  They have really really great food here plus an extremely extensive menu, but if you are looking for somewhere to go on a date or somewhere to relax, I would give BJs a couple months to get everything sorted out and settled.  I know I will wait to go back.",

They do a lot of things just ok but don't anything very well. Ribs were dry and over cooked and not very tender. Mashed potatoes were bland and cold. Asparagus pasta was bland and completely forgettable. Probably the biggest disappointment was the draft beer. I tried two selections and both came out with that sour, metallic-tasting, semi-flat taste that is probably caused by dirty lines, incorrect temperature, improper co2 regulation etc. It was so bad and skunky that I didn't finish my second beer. I wouldn't recommend nor would I go back.",

Yes- on Friday and Saturday nights there can be a wait to be seated (especially when there is a game on) but download the app and you can let them know you are coming ahead of time! I can see people got frustrated last Friday when a Pirates game was on... But honestly I got seated right away because I had the app and reserved a spot in line!  Plus you can get rewards with the app and coupons. The beer is fantastic and the staff is friendly. The food is good (the pizza is my favorite!) and I haven't tasted anything I didn't like.",

We started with the chicken pot stickers, and though they were good, the portions were very small for the price.  We had the buffalo chicken deep dish pizza. This was also pretty good, but not worth the price. The crust is excellent, but the buffalo chicken was pretty bland.  Service was below average. It took at least 10 minutes just to be asked if we wanted a drink. My wife had the watermelon mojito and loved it. I had a limited release Stone IPA that was blended with a BJs beer. It was unique and was good.  We asked for a side of ranch that took about 20 minutes to show up.  Not sure if we'll come back. Maybe for a drink.",

Now that it's been open for a few months the crowds have died down especially with Burgatory opening next door. Anyway, this place has a large seating area with a bunch of televisions. They have homemade Root Beer, orange soda, cream soda, etc. The root beer is really good. As far as the food the pizza is very solid and the burgers aren't bad. My favorite though is the balsamic glazed chicken (pictured below). It comes with mixed greens, onion straws and mashed potatoes. You get two decent sized pieces of grilled chicken smothered with balsamic vinaigrette and covered with the onion staws. It's the perfect portion that will make you comfortable full but still have room for desert. I would recommend this dish. The desert are amazing. They have P-Zookies cookies fried with ice cream on top that are to die for. Service has always been exceptional. One of my new favorite spots to go.",

The one thing that did draw me away while drinking were the high chairs they use in the upper part for seating, but the multiple flat screen TVs took my mind off of that almost right away. They do not have TouchTunes so the music option is out, and all your left w/ is lite chatter w/ the friends your w/.

BJ's started off strong.  Then, the descent towards cheapening everything in order to squeeze every cent possible for the sake of profitability begins. It's a slow descent so ownership doesn't think people will notice.  We'll take this off the menu, we'll use a slightly cheaper this or that.  It's the food business. There are like ten grades of everything. They'll never notice if we source this instead of that....Well, we do notice, and it unfortunately appears to me to be happening here.",

Everyone in our party was very pleased with their dinner selections and my roasted double pork chop was, without question, the best pork chop on earth!  We can't wait to return for another great dinner.",

Sat down in bar area where we were instructed to sit by hostess.... sat unnoticed for a while. Our very pregnant waitress comes over and gets our order of 2 philly cheese steak sandwiches with fries and cole slaw. She brings our waters and disappears..... then someone brings our food out without the slaw on either plate. Wait and finally get the slaw, no silverware..... had to call waitress back at which time we asked to get a coke to drink. Finish almost all of our food, comes by and slams drink down.... no apology, takes off. We inform her at the end of the meal, the philly cheese steak didn't have any onion on them... her response, let me look.... stands there, grabs a menu and sees it was supposed to have onion. Says, do you want onion, food almost gone! No we say... just the bill! Managers response.... \"sorry you didn't have a pleasant experience\"!",

    "text": "Nice chain restaurant tucked away in McCandless Crossing. American fare with very little imagination.  If you're a beer drinker then BJ's was built with you in mind.  Little impressed me about their food selection, but they have an enormous beer/cider selection.  Not being much of a drinker, the best I could muster was three stars. The waitstaff wasn't great, the food was unimaginative, but what I ate tasted pretty good.  They did mediocre exceptionally well.  Good for groups, kids, but the parking is awful.  They share a lot with a grocery store and another restaurant. Expect to walk a pretty good distance from your car to the door, and if it's calling for rain - bring an umbrella.  It's a hike.",

And our waitress, Taylor, was friendly, knowledgable, and attentive.  For dessert, I went with the salted caramel Pizookie.  It was yummy. Some of the caramel got crispy and that gave it a nice little crunch.  I'm glad this trip was better than my first.  I'll be back again.",

We tried about 8 different beers from BJ's and I liked them all! Their seasonal double IPA was super delicious, and their stouts were really tasty as well. For food, we ordered a couple small items- the fried portabella strips appetizer, the Brussels sprouts appetizer and a small Hawaiian pizza with habanero added (the bartenders recommendation). Everything was great- the portabella strips were juicy and the sauce that came with them were so complimenting. The Brussels sprouts were just as good, although I would have preferred if the sauce came on the side, rather than them swimming in the sauce. Regardless, the sauce was REALLY tasty. The pizza was super delicious, although I didn't really notice a spicy kick at all from the habanero. Just when I thought we were done eating, my friend ordered the ahi tuna appetizer. This was the first time I had ever tried raw tuna... and I really liked it. It was fresh, and the portion was pretty generous as well. Overall- we really enjoyed our afternoon here and I am looking forward to coming back for dinner sometime.",

My boyfriend and I were sitting at a booth at the front of the restaurant and right behind us were about 5-6 staff members hanging out and talking so loudly that we could hardly hear each other and pretty much had no choice but to listen to their conversations rather than have our own.  The food - presentation was great but that was about it. The bread bowl with broccoli cheddar soup was the only thing we enjoyed. My boyfriend ordered the hickory brisket and bacon burger. The brisket was lukewarm at best but tasted decent. The burger itself seemed like a frozen burger thrown on the grill, looked great on the outside but undercooked in the middle. The bacon was super greasy, like it was thrown in the dryer and put directly on the burger. I ordered the southern fried chicken. The mashed potatoes were good but the chicken was terrible. It way over cooked and hard to chew. We're not the type to send food back, we just probably won't be back. It was almost $40 (pretip) for lunch for two that neither of us enjoyed.",

We wanted pizzas as that seemed like the popular item to the folks around us but found out they were out of dough. After an expensive beer and no chance for pizza we weren't off to a great start. We ordered the potato skins, wings and 2 of the salads to share. The food was just o.k. Some of the potato skins were burnt and others seemed not cooked long enough. I also like mine with tons of cheese and bacon. These barely had any. The wings were pretty awful. Chicken was tough and chewy, not enough sauce on the wings which made it bland.

    "text": "Added our name to the Waitlist via the BJ's app on Friday at 5:15pm. It initially said there was a 15 minute wait for parties of our size (3) which was perfect because that is how long it takes us to get there. We arrive and check-in. The Wait Time on the app now says 35 minutes which we expect to be no problem as we don't mind waiting a few minutes until 5:50pm for our table to be ready. The App also mentions that \"This is not a reservation, so you may experience a slight wait when you arrive.\" As it approaches 6pm and we hear other parties with similar sized groups being called to be seated we start to wonder if the Wait List has even helped our place in line. This location is rather new and there always seems to be a crowd in the lobby - which is totally normal and expected. On this visit, though, they actually served small slices of pizza to the guests waiting for their tables. We thought this was a great! (I always thought a restaurant should have a separate sidebar and waiting room with light snacks to make the wait a little more bearable.) Anyways, we are seated at 6:05pm and order our drinks. We tried to order their newly advertised Pumpkin beer and our waitress tells us that they sold out in 6 days and it's no longer available (it's not even November!). We decide to order an appetizer - Sriracha Queso with Chips. Our family is no stranger to queso and this is our 2nd time ordering it at BJ's. We are always surprised how it seems to lack the Sriracha part. For dinner, I ordered the California Chicken Sandwich with fries. My wife, K, ordered the Spicy Peanut Chicken with Soba Noodles which was a new addition to the menu. Our son, G, ordered the BBQ Boneless wings - and the waitress suggested he try their Root Beer BBQ sauce on the side. We had a longer wait for our food than normal. Both adjacent tables who were seated after us received their meals before us - but there was no worry because our server brought us extra chips! Once the meals were delivered, I now understand why it took so long...they had to wait for my wife's dish to be delivered from Noodles & Company in Cranberry! The noodles and the portion size was much smaller than pictured. There was really no spicy component to it - it tasted more like an orange flavored sauce. My sandwich was delicious - lightly toasted and a healthy serving of avocado. G's Boneless Wings were plentiful - there had to be at least 15 on his plate! Overall, an OK experience that's why I gave it 3 stars. We still enjoy BJ's and their expansive menu - and especially the beer! The Jeremiah Red is my favorite! In the end, $50 for 3 is absolutely fair. We will be back again.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place...I went here with my family after we saw a movie.  We got seated quick and got our drinks. I was excited when I saw how extensive the menu was and, looking at the prices, I figured it would Cheesecake Factory quality stuff.  We ordered a Southern Fried Chicken, Deep Dish Ziti, and Flatbread Pizza, which arrived within 10 minutes.  This is when it fell apart.  My corn was cold, and the chicken and mashed potatoes were barely lukewarm.  The chicken was paper white inside and disgustingly dense, rather than the tender and juicy chicken I had been expecting.  The sauce on the ziti tasted like tombstone pizza sauce and had no distinguishable flavored.  The pizza had a soggy crust and the cheese tasted like a cheap version of Pizza Hut.  All of it was awful, but I guess the pizza was at least edible.  The conclusion we came to is that this place uses frozen meals (think Banquet, Lean Cuisine) and heats them up.  That explains how the chicken could be cold, yet cooked through and the total lack of flavor.  You could honestly find better food in the freezer aisle of Giant Eagle, at least it would be hot.  Will not be going back.  With all the options for food in this area, there's really no need for this house of horrors.",

    "text": "My partner and I have been back to this place about 5 times.  We used to be regulars at the location in our home town in Florida.  We were excited when they opened.  EVERY single time the service is absolutely the worst.  From the hostess to the wait staff.  Whenever we approach the hostess station we are met with a blank stare - no greeting, they don't ask how many we have, there is just an awkward silence before I feel uncomfortable and end up greeting the hostess instead...  Our first visit we were told by the hostess there was a 15 minute wait, so we sat down and waited around 20 minutes, making eye contact with the hostess, a young couple walked in and were seated immediately.  Then another, who were also seated immediately.  We stood up and asked why we hadn't been seated and the hostess simply replied \"Oh I forgot you were waiting.\"  No apology, nothing.  The wait staff is awful - no refills, no check in, different people delivering your food, no condiments, no silverware, getting a different drink when I do get a refill. On one occasion our waitress told us the cook \"forgot\" to cook our meal, so we waited almost an hour. When the manager came to our table he said \"I'm sorry I think our cook may be dyslexic.\" Eh - super offensive joke dude.  It has just always been an unpleasant experience.  We like the food and my partner loves the beer selection but it's not worth the hassle to come.  Sometimes we grab takeout but avoid the dine in experience and go to Burgatory.  Only plus is their deep dish pizza is to die for.",

I called the restaurant and a woman rudely answered and said their app is all messed up and it never works right. my thought is  so why have it?   anyway she told me there is not another one in Pittsburgh.  so an hour and a half of driving for nothing.  personally I don't think it's worth the wait and hassle.",

    "text": "As soon as we walked into the restaurant we were greeted by a scowl. I, the guest, was smiling at the \"Hostess\" while she continued to scowl at me and then asked, how many? No hello, no welcome, nothing. I told her 2 and she said there would be a 15 minute wait and tried talking us into the bar area. I kindly declined and told her we would wait for a table. The hostess then shoved the number pad at us and demanded a phone number & name. Wow, was this woman rude. As a \"Host\" you're the first person your guest sees and should be greeting each person with a welcoming smile. Didn't happen for us. This particular host must of had a problem with us because she then said hello and smiled at every person from us on. Can you say petty? Be professional, this isn't high school. Our server was super weeded in her section and looked so confused the entire time we were there. Food runners ran our appetizer and salads on top of each other and when our food came shortly after our app & salad, the food runner did not clear the plates. Drop and go must be BJs thing. Our stuffed mushrooms were cold and my califronia chicken sandwich was burnt. I used to love BJs down south, but this experience has ruined my love for your restaurant. The thing is, your food is still good and consistent...but I will never come back because your staff is sub par and has affected my experience tremendously. My suggestion is get better servers, hosts, and food runners because you guys have it all wrong with all the wrong people. Indulging guests is easy with quality people that care for their craft.",

If you liked TGI Fridays 15 years ago this place is the updated brew house equivalent, with a dose of cheesecake factory for good measure.  After 3 visits the photos in the menu are the most impressive thing about the food.  The environment at BJ's  is stressful due to the busy crowds and chaotic haphazard service.  They have good beer,  but the house offerings are all pretty uninspired and safe.  The best beer offerings are available nearby in much better restaurants,  especially if you appreciate sole-proprietorships and less \"corporate\"  atmospheres.  Again 10-15 years ago this place would have been something.  Today it's only notable quality is the crowds.",

Not good for conversation and actually gave me a headache. Ordered mahi tacos, wife ordered similar. Pretty quick service and waiter was nice enough. The food was just so-so, not great by any stretch of the imagination, i.e. not seasoned well and very little flavor, and the servings were pitiful...two small tacos with 5 chips and salsa. Overpriced and not a good value at all. Left there still hungry and feeling a bit ripped off. Went to Trader Joe's for snacks. Will not return.",

We had a waiter named Blake who was really nice but forgot my mothers apps which happens but told us he was overwhelmed with our drink order so he gave up our table(we were a table of 10). So he gave up our table and half the dinners came out meanwhile the other half were again forgotten. Then the new person waiting of us named Chelsea started and no waters filled or empty plates taken. Not a big deal but she would ask who wants a water and then just walk away lol. My moms app came out like after she canceled, the manager was nice and took it off the bill. The waitress Chelsea in a sarcastic way said \"well this is gonna be a great night\" right next to us. Just not something a waitress should do in front of her table. After this experience I don't think id ever go back, along with the party I was with :(",

    "text": "This was our first time at BJs. Four adults and 3 children ( 2 of them being 7 years old) for dinner today. They were busy, but we only waited a short time to get a seat. Once we were seated, we waited about 15 minutes for a waitress to come and take our drink order, then another 15 minutes for them to come. We each ordered a beer and were then asked for our IDs. With 3 older kids at our table the waitress stood there and scanned every detail of each of our IDs (mind you, we are all in our 30s with children). After trying to order chips and dip for appetizer, the waitress returned, much later, to tell us they were out of them. After our appetizers came we had to flag the waitress down and ask her if we could order, at this point we had already been there an hour! She finally took our order and then returned 3 separate times to tell us that they were out of the things we had ordered! Refills were never offered or given and we had to ask for dirty plates to be removed. I ordered the slider burgers with fries. The burgers were thin chip-like burgers that were burnt. I asked the waitress if they were supposed to come with grilled onions like the menu said and she stated they were in the patty. I found ONE onion in one out of 4 burgers! No apologies for the terrible food and service. The service was absolutely unacceptable, and 2 hours for dinner is outrageous especially when you're trying to entertain kids! We will certainly NOT be returning!",

    "text": "Unfortunately this place has gone down in quality over our visits in the past year. We visited this location a total of 4 times. If I rated this place after my first trip I would have easily given it 5 stars. On the first trip our service by Courtney was amazing, the beer selection was great (and still is), and the chicken dinner and pizza was really good. We enjoyed it so much we came back. Every trip we waited over an hour for a table for 3. The \"online check in\" never worked for us. It would say 45 minute wait and we'd arrive 45 mins later and still wait 45 more mins. This actually happened all 4 times. Our second trip my salad was forgotten. A person brought my daughter's salad and said mine would \"be right out\". Our dinners arrived and still no salad. Our pizza was served with very little toppings for the cost and we were disappointed. We decided it could have been a fluke so we returned for trip 3. This trip our server carried out the mug of root beer grasping it with her hand over the top of the mug instead of using the handle. When our pizza arrived it was served by another person and not our server. Our server came to our table and said she couldn't believe how lazy the staff was. She said the person who brought our food was supposed to serve us our first piece of pizza. I said I didn't care and it was ok but she continued to rant about her lazy co-workers. She said she would serve it to us (Which I insisted she didn't need to do). She proceeds to cut a piece with the utensil and actually lifted up the pizza with her bare hand and placed it on my plate. I was so grossed out by this that we asked for a box and took our remaining pizza home to eat..and obviously left the pizza she served with her bare hands behind. It took us 6 months to decide to give this place ONE more chance (stupid us, I know, but we kept hoping for a trip like our first visit). We returned as long as as we didn't get the same server that clearly had never attended a food handling training. Our final visit started by being seated at a dirty table. Then my husband got a salad with a giant hair (looked to be about 10 inches long) tangled all through it. He told the server and she lifted it up and said \"where, I don't see it?\" Then she goes \"oh wait, there it is! Wow that's really gross!\" .....umm yes it was. My chicken dinner was served on a plate with red crusty sauce stains and my chicken had white sauce in it so the crusty marks were due to using a dirty dish. At this point I was fed up and angry at myself for giving this place so many chances. The server didn't bring out my husband his \"hair free salad\" until our dinners were served, and the salad remained on our bill and a manager never came to talk to us. It was all very unfortunate because the place had a lot of potential with a prime location, excellent beer choices, and a gigantic menu. However, poor service and lack of cleanliness has caused this place to be on our never return list. The beer quality and quantity is the only reason I was willing to give this place a few stars. The only way I would recommend this place is to stop in and get a growler of beer to go.",

We were seated immediately (as the restaurant was not full), and then were forgotten/ignored by the waiters for more than 20 minutes. Not even water or silverware was delivered. The wait staff seemed to deliberately avoid looking in our direction as they walked past.  We flagged down a bus boy who seemed rather surprised that we should ask for a waiter. After a further 5 minutes, we left, again without a server coming to our table. As we left, the server and manager tried to intercept us but my customers had already left. After two attempts to try BJs, I doubt that there will be a third. Long wait times to get seated or being ignored after being seated do not seem to be a good indicator.  As a general note, the parking situation is terrible at McCandless Crossing. Hopefully it will improve once the construction is finished.",

Only once did I order something other than pizza (I believe it was tacos!). My boyfriend and I loveeee the pizza. I usually get a small (for myself) because I like to take a few pieces for leftovers! My favorite is the buffalo chicken pizza, my boyfriend's is the classic combo. The chicken bacon ranch and bbq chicken are also good contenders. Tonight I tried the Great White, which had Alfredo sauce, chicken, mushrooms and tomatoes. So good!! We've always had really friendly service at both locations and the beer they have on tap is pretty excellent too!",

We got the avocado egg rolls for appetizer and that tasted strange to me - not off but just having avocado in a dish that was warmer seemed strange to me like it needed to be eaten chilled. The taste of the avocado egg rolls was not to my liking, either, not being able to make out the avocado and chicken components. I also got the in-house root beer which I rate at 6 our of 10 on my scale, and it had a strong licorice flavor.  For entrees, my husband got the baked ziti and that is just as you'd expect with a nice flavor to the tomato sauce and a nice bite to the pasta. I ordered the fish and chips and it came with string fries which were very good. The breading was light and the fish had a great flavor. I will be ordering that again.   Finally, for dessert we ordered the peanut butter pizookie as I've had it before and it's always delicious.",

My advice if you're determined to come here? Sit at the bar and don't get food. Just order beer. You have half a chance of actually enjoying it.   This time we got there 10 minutes after they opened for a pre-movie lunch. 35 minutes later all I had was a water, nearly empty. There were no more than 5-6 other people in there. There were at least 10 servers, 6 of whom yakked it up in one corner and didn't move the entire time we were there. Ok, maybe there was a meeting. If so, I hope it was about how crappy the service is and what they need to do to fix it. But I doubt it.   The food is just ok. The fries are so skinny it's like what's left over from the potato after the real restaurants take what they need. And they are not good. Burger was ok but I've had better at most bars. Yeah, I've had way better. And without the disaster that is their service. Don't look for me here. I'll be somewhere where the food tastes great and customer service actually means something.",

BJs is a chain restaurant with a decent concept of large beer selections (many their own house brews) & a huge menu with so many options that seem to be executed in a very average way. Not bad but nothing that would ever wow you. And like many chain restaurants you get inconsistencies in service from a very large staff.   Their Hopstorm IPA is pretty solid and at $3.50 a glass at lunchtime one day, we were pleased. Their lunchtime BBQ plate was very reasonably priced under $7 and plenty of food but the pulled pork slider & BBQ chicken breast were average tasting fare. I'd describe the pesto chicken sandwich I had today exactly in those same terms with the addition today of slow service to go with it.   We definitely had better service last time at the bar than at a table today. There seemed to be lots of servers running around & standing around but very few people getting food.   I've heard this place has been super busy with long wait times. Today it was nearly empty and we had a long wait - well over 30 minutes for lunch to arrive. Something to definitely keep in mind.",

    "text": "Yelpers, you seem to have this one right on the money. Three stars is a pretty accurate rating for this middling restaurant.  We came here with some friends the other night. In general, I'm not a huge fan of chain restaurants, but I try to keep an open mind. Chain or not, if a restaurant has good food and service, I'm game.   Unfortunately, BJ's Brewhouse doesn't excel in either food or service. On the Saturday night we were there, it was quite busy, and apparently is usually that way. With so many good restaurants in Pittsburgh, I can't quite understand why, but some mysteries of the universe don't have a good answer. We grabbed drinks and an appetizer at the bar while we waited for our table. Our appetizer, the chips with sriracha queso dip, arrived quickly, but it was lukewarm. Lukewarm food is always a punishable crime, but it gets elevated from misdemeanor to felony any time cheese is involved. Because it wasn't hot enough, the queso was thick and semi-coagulated...quite unappealing. Also, despite its name, there was no sriracha flavor in the queso at all (which was so disappointing, as I love me some sriracha).   Once we were seated, it took awhile for our server to refresh our bar drinks and take our order. And unfortunately, it was this way throughout most of our meal...our server was largely absent, and we had to repeatedly flag him down when we needed something. As for our food, we all ordered different things, with mixed results. One friend ordered fried artichokes, tomato soup, and a mozzarella and tomato salad. She reported that the soup and salad were good....fairly standard (as she pointed out, it's pretty hard to mess up tomato soup and mozzarella salad). The fried artichokes, however, were disappointing in that they didn't have any discernible artichoke in them....she said they pretty much just tasted like fried breading. Another friend got the spinach-stuffed mushrooms and thought they were tasty. My husband got the California Chicken Club, which came with a mountain of fries. He thought the sandwich was way too greasy. The bread was very heavily buttered, which made this light-sounding sandwich much heavier than it needed to be. I tried a few of his fries and they were decent....very thin cut and crispy. As for me, I opted for boneless wings with Peppered BBQ sauce. The portion of wings was HUGE....I clearly failed to notice the menu description stated that it was a pound of wings. Uh, whoops. A pound of fried anything for dinner is never well-advised. So needless to say, a doggie bag was needed. The wings themselves were crispy and meaty (thumbs up), but unfortunately there was barely any sauce on them (thumbs down). I wanted to ask for more sauce, but couldn't find our server. So most of the wings I ate were dry and largely devoid of flavor. Total bummer!  As for drinks and dessert....my one friend ordered a watermelon basil margarita and found it to be sweet to the point of being undrinkable. To our server's credit, once we flagged him down and told him that she wanted a beer instead, he took the drink back and didn't charge her for it, so that was good. My husband ordered a couple of their porters and thought they were okay, but was expecting more from a place that brews its own beer. For dessert, we of course had to try their famous pizookie, which is a freshly-baked cookie with ice cream on top. We shared the pizzokie trio so we could try several flavors (we chose salted caramel, cookies and cream, and peanut butter). My friends went nuts over the pizookies and thought they were insanely delicious. Personally, while I thought they were good (I mean, you almost have to actively *try* to make anything with cookies and ice cream taste bad, right?), I thought in general they were a bit too sweet and the individual flavors of each pizookie were drowned out in the overload of sugar. So all three mostly ended up just tasting like generic cookie with generic ice cream to me. Also, the edges of the cookies were overcooked to the point where it created a very unpleasant tough texture in those spots. I dunno...I guess I fancy myself a bit of a dessert snob, so when something is hyped up to the extent the famous pizookie is, I expect it to deliver. This was just so-so for me (but again, my friends loved it, so different strokes).  The above rambling dissertation essentially boils down to the fact that BJ's is quite average across the board. While it's not terrible, it's not a place that I will seek out, and it's certainly not worth waiting for on a busy Saturday night. Go elsewhere, my hungry friends.",

We saw allot that looked appealing but my wife ordered the Crusted Chicken Parmesan and I ordered the special, Prime Rib. We both got the same sides- White Cheddar Mashed Potatoes and Broccoli. My meal came with a salad, I picked a Caesar Salad. The salad was decent, I've had a few better but it was good and I enjoyed it, it was just a salad.  Meals came quickly, hot and large portions, large enough for us to have leftovers! Both were VERY tasty.  The Chicken was tender and flavorful.  The Prime Rib was equally tender, well seasoned and excellent cut with little fat.   Saving room for dessert, we got the Triple Chocolate Pizookie...fancy word for a large baked cookie, topped with chocolate ice cream.  It was also very good and we like the dessert.   Prices were decent, nothing outrageous, so wet felt we got our monies worth.  The place was clean and in good shape.  Service was good, people were mostly friendly, with our server being pretty attentive. The Greeter could've been a little more friendly or positive when we walked thru the door.   Overall, we really enjoyed our visit and food and will be back to try something else on their large menu.",

The interior is fun and the lighting of the bottles on the bar created a really cool atmosphere.  I ordered the Mini One Topping Pizza with a side salad.  It was only $7.50 which I thought was an awesome lunch time deal.  I wasn't really thrilled, though.  It's a deep dish pizza, which is fine, but it just felt so...messy.  I ate it with a fork and knife because that was the only option, but even then I didn't feel like I could enjoy it.  I didn't know anything about BJ's prior to the day of, but as a chain restaurant it definitely has that chain restaurant food taste.  So I wouldn't expect much more than that.  We also all commented on the loud echo in the restaurant.  There weren't many people there, but everything reverberated.  I don't drink but there was a massive board with a list of beers.  If you're a beer drinker, this really wouldn't be a bad place to go to sit and hang with friends over a couple of beers.",

Second time I went with my husband. I got a salad with shrimp and the shrimp were absolutely horrible. Tiny and tasted so fishy and old. Not the way shrimp should taste. Waitress took my plate, and pretended to not notice that all my shrimp were pushed to the side with my salad barely eaten.   The 3rd time my husband and I went with another couple, and their twin babies, who were 4 months old. Our waitress started out great. Really friendly. But then almost got too friendly where she felt comfortable enough to complain about working so long.  She put our appetizer order in, and the apps were good. About an hour later, my husband asked about our food. She said \"don't worry it is coming!\" After another 15 minutes, he asked again. She had a distraught look on her face all of a sudden, and said she'd be back. Then the manager said she forgot to put our order in !  Let me remind you the 2, 4-month old babies who were with us. About 20 minutes later we got our order. The waitress came to our table, did not apologize or even acknowledge anything was off. It was so unprofessional.   My husband and I went back a 4th time this past weekend and got the siracha cheese nachos for our appetizers and the cheese was cold, and was not spicy or tasty at all. He ordered a chicken salad and I ordered a pizza (cuz at this point I'm nervous to order anything else, to be honest!) and my pizza was so cold when it came out, and my husband (who isn't picky about his chicken) said the chicken was really rubbery and tasted old.   I really wanted to like you, BJs, I just think you need to work out a lot of kinks before I'll go back for a while unfortunately.",

    "text": "I stopped by here last night, a Thursday, with four other guys for dinner.  We were planning on eating at 7 and one of our party arrived there at 6:45 and was told that there was a 50 minute wait.  That ended up being almost spot on as the text message came in at 7:30 telling us that our table was ready.  The inside of BJ's looks quite nice as it is large and fairly open.  On one side of the restaurant is a large well lit and well stocked bar while the rest of the restaurant is for seating.  They also have a large chalkboard menu for their beer selections, a large number of TVs and some random open garage doors as dividers.  To start off the evening I went with a sampler of their beers and picked their Irish red, imperial stout, pale ale and IPA.  All of it tasted pretty good with my favorite of the bunch being the pale ale which had an interesting flavor to it.  After getting our drinks we all put in our entree orders and I went with the sriracha chicken macaroni and cheese.  In the meantime I pulled my silverware out of the napkin and put it on my lap.  The napkin was wet and would ultimately end up getting my jeans uncomfortably damp.  I didn't say anything at the time but at a later point it came up at our table and we found out that four of our five napkins were this way.  Our food ended up taking almost an hour to get to our table.  I chalked it up to the place being busy but whenever we looked around we discovered that no one in our section had food.  Whenever the food was finally delivered it was quite the disappointment as well.  The chicken in my macaroni and cheese was cold (thankfully precooked) while the rest of my dish was luke warm at best.  So I asked the table whose dish we had waited on as one of ours ought to have been hot.  Bizarrely everyone's food was pretty cold and even the deep dish pizza pan that they had carried out to our table with tongs was at room temperature.  My buddy next to me had the wings and took one bite before sending them back because they were cold.  Another friend ate half a shrimp taco before noticing a grey shrimp and stopping.  In the meantime I plowed through my luke warm pasta and cold chicken.  The flavor of the food actually wasn't that bad as i loved the cheese and sriracha with the chicken.  It would have been so much better if it was hot though as who likes cold Mac and cheese?  My buddy who got the cold wings ended up calling the manager over and politely informed him of the issues and asked if there was a problem in the kitchen that night.  The manager informed us that they just got backed up and didn't really say too much else.  His whole visit to our table lasted around 45 seconds and he ended up comping every meal at the table which was nice.  So in the end, all that we ended up paying for was the beer and tip.  The bottom line for me is that I will not be heading back here again in the future.  My friends strongly urged me to give it a 1 star review and I considered it.  While this was certainly one of the least enjoyable dining experiences I have had recently, at least no one that I know of got sick and there was the positive aspect of good beer.",

I ordered the Barbacoa Chicken with Rice and black beans and my girlfriend got the pesto chicken sandwich, both of which were delicious.  We also ordered the sliders, which were really flavorful - but the buns were really greasy.  I was excited to take some friends there after having a really good first experience, and we went back yesterday and couldn't have been more disappointed.  The menu is very large, which in theory isn't a bad thing as long as you can make all of the dishes well.  We ordered the avacado egg rolls and a mini pizza for appetizers.  One of us got chicken tacos and 3 of us ordered burgers done \"medium.\"   Our appetizers came out a few mins AFTER our main courses.  The Medium burgers all came out WELL done.  Zero pink in the middle, char burnt on the outside.  It made for an extremely below average burger experience.  The avacado egg rolls has a brownish tint to them - which indicated that the avacado wasn't prepared freshly.  They were very average.  The pizza and chicken tacos were really good - and because of the mixup with our order the manager comped us our dessert.  We got a few pizookies which was the highlight of the night.    All in all really disappointed with the service.  Most of the knocks on this place are service related and it starts from the top down (management).  The servers were really polite and seemed to be doing the best they could.  Also don't waste your time ordering a burger here, opt for something else.",

    "text": "So, I have given Bj's 3 tries. The first time I went, I was with my boyfriend and we shared a beer and a couple appetizers. It was the middle of a Saturday and we had no wait. The waitress was great! Food came out quickly as well as our beers. The pork fries on the app menu is delicious and the flatbread was just ok. I enjoyed my experience and encouraged friends to try it out as well.  The second time I went was with 3 girlfriends and it was less than stellar. I ordered a flight of beer and was disappointed when knowing nothing about the house beers could match them up to the appropriate name better than her. It was awkward. That was the first time I tried the personal deep dish pizza and it was probably the most amazing thing ever. Our waitress for the table was nice and sort of attentive but the amount of other people that come to your table to bring drinks, salads, entrees, is unbelievable and weird. It makes it hard to ask for refills or even an extra napkin. So, after this time, I understood the complaints about slow food and service from friends.   The third time I went was with another couple. When we showed up, we knew there would be a wait since it was a Sunday night. The way they have the front set up is weird with 2 different stations. Even though I had already been there, I was unsure which station to go to. We put our name in and waited by the bar. After waiting for about half an hour, we asked if the booths in the bar area were seat yourself, they said yes! Why didn't anyone tell us this! So we sat at an empty booth and proceeded to have a pretty good time. I ordered the jalapeno cucumber margarita which was delicious and my friend ordered a house made creme soda which she said was amazing. We all ordered different things, deep dish personal pizza, alfredo pasta, brisket burger, and another deep dish personal pizza. We all finished our meals and they were all very well made.   In conclusion, I will keep going  back because the food is so good, just knowing the service is VERY hit or miss and you should pace yourself on any drink because you are unsure when it will be filled again.",

    "text": "If I had written this review earlier, it would have been 5 stars.  After last week, they get three.  We had visited on some very busy occasions and each time, the wait time was reasonable, service was good and the food was great.  The bf loves all the brew choices and would be happy to dine here everyday of the week!    We have tried items from their Enlightened menu, keep in mind even though the calorie count is fairly decent, the fat content is still pretty high.  We tried both the salmon and the chicken/spinach quinoa bowls and both were very tasty.  We also tried the barbocoa chicken and the Asian chopped chicken salad, delicious.  My favorite meal here was the bison burger served with tasty slaw.  The bun was perfectly toasted, the meat was a perfect medium well.  Not from the Enlightened menu, the bf had the clam chowder in the bread bowl.  Best bread bowl ever.  Amazing.  One time, we even tried a calorie laden Pizookie.    With all these raves about the food, why only 3 stars?  As fans of the restaurant, we had downloaded their app and used it on our last visit to get added to their \"preferred wait list\". We were given a 40 minute wait time estimate, so we planned our arrival time around that.  When we arrived, there was only about a dozen people waiting.  We were told, so sorry, but the app doesn't really work and we should have called instead.  But they would do their best to get us a table in about another 20 minutes.  We went shopping at Trader Joe's and then decided not to wait for BJ's and went elsewhere for dinner.  Wouldn't you know, we had finished our meals when we got the text from BJ's that our table was finally ready.  Needless to say, we have not been back.  After being open for 2 months, customer service should be improving, not going downhill.  You give a guest the expectation of being seated in 40 minutes and you can't deliver that in over an hour and a half?  Ha.",

I have nothing against the restaurant in terms of food or service, they were good when I've eaten there. However I did have the same experience as he did. I ordered online and payed online. When I showed up, they said they had no record of my payment being received.  My friends experience was way worse then mine. The manager even threatened to call the POLICE on him!!!!  Totally unacceptable!  They need to FIX this problem",

We've had outstanding service and horrible service.   My biggest issue is with the deception of their menu and lack of ethics on the part of their management.  Their website (not the national one either, specifically the one you get after choosing McCandless) says that Tuesday's they have half off Glasses and Bottles of wine.  They told my wife that it does not apply to PA because of the liquor laws they can only discount so much.  Fair answer....except there are multiple other restaurant chains in the market that do offer half off bottles...in particular one that does so on Wednesdays and another on Sundays (I'll leave them nameless).    Needless to say if the Manager is that much of a jack...it speaks volumes as to why the service and attitudes in general are spotty.  Go elsewhere. There are a TON of great options in Pittsburgh.",

Veggie burger on lettuce, came out a turkey burger on a bun. Not only that, but 5 of the 8 orders at our table were incorrect in one way or another. Then the manager comes over and jokes about the fact that me and one other person don't have any food because they made it wrong. Everyone was done eating by the time we got our food, and bedside joking about it he didn't formally apologize, take money off of the bill, or check to make sure that the food that came out was correct. Really really bad management and possible service?? Or the cooks don't follow directions??? Who knows...",

    "text": "I must admit that this is the 2nd BJs I have visited and I was a bit disappointed to learn that they are not alike. They APPEAR alike because this restaurant is an exact copy of the one I previously reviewed at South Hills Village.  We had a 15 minute wait to be seated. I have the app but wasn't sure when the rest of our party would arrive so I did not reserve ahead of time. When you have to wait you give them your name and cell number so they can text you when they have a booth waiting for you.  The menu and beers are identical to the South Hills one. I showed my waiter my rewards number on my phone so he took note of it. When you spend so much on a tier then you get a small reward. My son and daughter decided to split a large deep dish pizza since on Mondays pizza is half off. I went with my lunch portion of the thyme chicken I had before.   I sampled their pizza and it was very rich and quite filling. When I started my meal again I found it was not heated up. So I asked my waiter to heat it up which he did. Later I found the ice had melted in my tea so I had to wait a while to get a cup of ice to cool it down. The food is the same and was just enough for me.  We decided to order the pizookies for dessert. This time I got the chocolate chunk mini and my kids got the chocolate cookie covered with ice cream for the dessert. As always they were very good. The waiter brought my check early and then when he added in the desserts I later found out that I was not awarded my points for this visit.  I found that out after we left so I called over there and spoke to a manager. He told me he would credit the points to my account but it would take a few days. Normally when I ate at the one in the South Hills I would get an email immediately . He told me this wasn't the case. This BJs sits in a strip mall which is part of McCandless crossing. I also learned during this visit that they are planning on building a third location out in Robinson. My guess would be Settler's Ridge but time will tell if it will go there or among the restaurants near the mall of Robinson. They also plan to build one in Cranberry as well.",

It's always crowded for dinner and you can either get a pager and wait it out or try your luck scoping out one of the open bar or bar area table seats which are all first come first serve.  They have a nice selection of draft beer to choose from and brew some of their own tasty concoctions as well as featuring many mainstream local and national favorites.   We have one favorite dish on the menu that is hard to pass up.  It's the North Beach Mahi Mahi and Shrimp and it is so delicious.  It features black olive pieces, tomatoes, and pearl cous cous in the most delightful broth featuring an anise licorice flavor.  The fish is moist and meaty in texture and flakes easily.  It is just the right amount to fill you up but leave enough room for one of their delicious peanut butter and jelly pizookies.    This last visit we tried something new: golden asparagus with lemon aioli sauce.  It was good and fried.  I mean, who doesn't like fried, right?  This is a tempura-like batter that was a little thick in certain spots but very tasty.   The service is always good and efficient.  We often stop by for a late meal.",

The food menu is HUGE & I think they can afford to downsize. I think it's weird that a large portion of the menu is for lunch hours only. There are more vegetarian options for lunch than for dinner. They have a space on their menu that says, \"We have LOTS of vegetarian options, ask your waiter what meals can be made into vegetarian options\". I wish that they had a leaf marker on Vegetarian/Vegan options like most other places do to make it easier for the customer. Food quality isn't too notch, but it is what you'd expect from a chain restaraunt. Nothing great, nothing terrible.",

Too bad because I miss Gordon Bierch's beer since moving to Pittsburgh...BJ's is not an equivalent substitute.

The table next to us ordered after us but was already on dessert while we were looking for drink refills. Their waiter checked on them more often.  Food was okay. I had a salad with grilled salmon. The salmon was a tail section and over cooked so a bit dry. We tried a few of their drafts. I liked the brown ale \"Nutty Brewnette.\"  Our waitress on the second visit didn't know much about the menu. My husband asked questions and then didn't get what he thought he was going to get. I was trying to avoid a cocktail with pre made mix but ended up with a sickeningly sweet one.   With so many options around, we might skip this franchise in future.",

With a two year old child and and 80 year old great-grandparents in the group there is no way we can wait a long time for a table. I guess BJ's doesn't really want large groups.  Update: Thank you Logan for your response. You may want to instruct your staff to inform callers that reservations for large groups can be made. When I called today I was told there would be a wait and was not told about the reservation policy. I realize making a reservation the same day would likely result in a long wait or not be feasible at all, but I wasn't given that option. We will try again another time.",

The menu is also very extensive with all kinds of options. It has more traditional American style chain restaurant food like burgers and steaks and also some specialty options like cauliflower tacos. The staff were also very friendly and polite.  As far as the food,drinks, menu options, and space go the restaurant is great. However: the service was very very slow. And not in the sense it took our food a long time to come out or the restaurant was overly crowded - the food itself took an average length of time and the restaurant had hardly any wait and open seats were around us. Our waiter just kept leaving us hanging for long periods of time. My boyfriend asked for ketchup as soon as our food came out and didn't get it until almost 10 minutes later. We had long been done eating when she brought us our check and she didn't come back to get it until another 10 minutes went by. All In all our meal took 2 hours to complete for 2 people when all we ordered were entrees and a shared dessert.",

The place was empty, so we figured service would be quick and attentive. We were very wrong. They were completely out of kids' menus, so we had to guess at what to order. Appetizer of guacamole and chips took 20 minutes to arrive. Kids' meals arrived shortly thereafter, but their applesauce was served in a sealed generic GFS container. A bowl would have been too much work, I guess. My husband's salad never did show up, so we asked for it to be removed from our check. Drinks were woefully neglected, and the check took another 15-20 minutes to be taken care of after we requested it. The whole time, it was impossible to find our server anywhere. Usually we give places a couple tries before we give up, but we aren't willing to drop another $50 on this place. Save your money and time and go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I tried this place last night and was seriously shocked at the lack of service I received. The high school girl taking names at the door could care less about her job and clearly would rather be anywhere else but there. It was a busy Saturday night and the girl told us the wait would be 45 min. We deiced to wait. They take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. From the start I thought this was a terrible idea. I also have an out of state number so from the start I was worried something would go wrong. As we sat and waited the high schooler told each party after us a different time. The people after us was an hour, a few more people later it was 90min and then it was 25min. Clearly she had no idea what she was doing.   Finally after about 40min I started to notice people being taken that had come in long after we did so I decided to inquire. The snotty high schooler gave such sass when I asked that I almost walked out right then and there (and trust me I should have!). Without looking up my name or  any sort of information she told me the people were being taken because they'd called ahead. That very well may be but she hadn't even looked my name up to make sure that was True. Clearly just an answer the management teaches the hostess to say. So I then inquired how long it would be until my name was called and she proceeded to tell me that actually my number had already been texted and I had missed my table. We had been sitting right in front of this girl the entire time with my phone in my hand and I had not missed a text. She then read me my number that I supposedly had given her and it was all sorts of wrong. Now I don't really blame the girl for messing up a phone number because it was busy and loud, and one that was out of state, but it was her attitude and her \"I don't give a crap\" tone that made it not okay. I started to get really angry because I was getting no where with this child who didn't know what she was doing. I proceed to ask how much longer it will be and she says \"it will be the next table\" so I ask again \"how long\" and she just kept giving a snarky response of \"it will be the next table\".  Due to this girl's attitude I decided it was time to ask for the manager. I had to ask THREE TIMES before I got the manager. The first time the manager was not around, the second she, the hostess, blew me off and the third I realized he was standing, hiding behind some other hostesses because he saw what was going on and didn't want to deal. It took three tries to get the manager and even on the third try the girls working the hostess desk played telephone to tell him why I was mad and he finally, slowly made his way over to me. At this point I was pretty upset and told him what a crappy job the hostess was doing and how disappointed we were. THE MANAGER WALKED AWAY FROM ME. In the middle of my rant he just walks away and disappears. Now I was upset but I was in no way out of control or doing anything that would require him walking away. A simple apology and a table would have done the trick but he walked away. At this point another hostess takes us to our table and the manager is still out of sight. He finally comes over a few minutes later and said \"sorry I was making sure you got a free app\". Still never did I get an apology for the poor treatment from the idiot at the door or from him...I didn't even want a free app!!!  After we sat down I tried to calm down but was still really shocked at how disrespected I had been. I was really hoping the food would make up for the lack of service but unfortunately it did not. The free appetizer we got wasn't bad (avocado spring rolls) but the pizza we ordered was TERRIBLE. We order a pizza with olives, onions, pepperoni, and sausage. The moment the pizza was put down on the table I looked at it funny, questioning if it was even throughly cooked. The second I took a bite I knew it was not. The pizza tasted uncooked and was cold. I wasn't about to complain after the lack of respect I had already received from the manager but the food was awful.   I would not recommend this place at all. I have been to the one in Columbus and it wasn't bad but this place is truly awful. Even the staff that I didn't have a run in with looked miserable. It's a shame this place is so terribly run and doesn't offer good food when it just opened. I would recommend skipping this place and choosing somewhere else in Mccandless Crossing or somewhere else on McKnight Road. I will not be returning.",

    "text": "Hubby and I finally went to this restaurant on Thursday night. First and last time we will.  Service leaves a lot to be desired for. Food took forever to get. Waitress came to us several times to apologize, and say that the food was coming soon.   It was NOT worth the wait. I ordered the burger with a side of mashed potatoes. They brought it, and the burger was overcooked, and had bacon on it...I didn't order it this way...I don't eat pork, and was totally turned off. Told the it wasn't mine, and the server insisted it was. I told her it wasn't, as I did not order bacon, and she said, \"oh, it must be HIS\", meaning my husband. He already had his burger in front of him, with the bacon that he ordered.  They just made them both the same. I sent it back, they offered to take the burger off of my bill, AND get me a free one.  I told them no, I would just eat the potatoes.  They tried several times to make me another, and I politely refused the offer. The waitress then said, \"Why wouldn't you want a FREE burger?\".  I told her because if they could not get it right the first time, I don't want it.  How hard is it to get a rare burger with cheese?  They specialize in burgers, don't they????  Anyway, I have a personal rule for myself. If I wait forever for my food, and they mess it up, I don't want it or anything else from the \"chef\".  Period. I watched too many movies where the cook spits on the food, since someone complained, and I am not taking the chance.  I ate the mashed potatoes, and they were pretty lame.  My husband's burger was mediocre, at best.  He told me to be glad that they took mine back, as it was pretty bad.  Sad that the North Hills can't get any good restaurants. All they are getting are chains, and the procedures are an assembly line, I think.  No thanks, before I pay for bad food, I will just eat at home.",

    "text": "I have tried this location four times, with the most recent being Saturday July 11 at 10:30pm.   They seem to be making small steps to improve their service. During my last visit the table runners appeared to have learned the table numbers because all food and drink brought to the table was correct.   A few people have complained about the wait time. I have been there twice on Saturday evenings and each time I was told the wait would be 5 minutes and was seated before that time. My first visit was a Sunday afternoon and although I was seated promptly they got busy quickly, be prepared for a wait on Sunday afternoon.   After being seated the waitress was prompt to take drink orders. However, the orders needed to be repeated due to how loud the background music was. They had the Cardinals vs Pirates game on the televisions and someone was raising and lowering the volume based on which team was at bat.  One area they need to improve on is kitchen communication. I have ordered their chicken potstickers twice, my first time and most recent visit. When the potstickers got to the table the chicken was cooked thoroughly, no pink, but was cold. The first time the potstickers came out then 2 minutes later my entree arrived, the most recent time my entree arrived before the appetizer.  For this trip when my entree, New Orleans Jambalaya, arrived cold. I have had jambalaya in New Orleans and the dish I had at BJ's lacked the flavor and spice that would be in a jambalaya in New Orleans.  The highlight for any trip to BJ's is their beverages. Their home made beers and soda's are tasty.  The first time I was there my waiter said they are like the Cheesecake Factory. After having been to BJ's four times and the Cheesecake Factory more times than I can count I disagree with what my first waiter said. The food and service at BJ's is well below the level that one gets at the Cheesecake Factory. If you are looking for a place to eat go the extra 3 miles down to the Cheesecake Factory. I won't be going back until September to give them time to improve.",

    "text": "I hesitated in giving a one star review, but after 5+ trips, they earned it. The food is usually good - 3-4 stars - and the beer and drinks are good. What kills this place is the horrendous service. It's beyond bad. Like a 0 is more appropriate than a 1. They are slow on food and drinks. We got our meals before the appetizer on two occasions. Once they ran out of what we ordered and the server never came to tell us - we were there for about 2 hours, were served one drink, never got what ordered, then had the manager come and tell us he \"put something in\" for us and hoped we would like it because they ran out of pasta (seriously?!). It's just not worth the continued aggravation to try to give this place chance after chance. It's so convenient and this area desperately needed some other dining options but this place is just a disaster.",

Not a thing to complain about. The pickles were amazing little crunchy pieces of heaven. I'm wondering if I could go in and just order a jar of pickles?  The root beer was probably the best soda I've ever had and who knew that something as simple as a chocolate chip cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream could make you feel like you just won dessert lottery?   They have a ton of different things on their menu. There is something for everyone. Next time I'm bringing a DD and trying a few of their cocktails and sangria. They also have a decent wine selection and obviously plenty of beer.",

    "text": "I really want to know how this restaurant functions on a night that it's actually busy. Came here for my birthday tonight. My sister in law tried calling ahead to make a reservation as it was going to be 8 adults and a baby. She was told that we couldn't get a reservation because our party was larger than 6 people (first red flag). However, she was assured that they are NEVER busy on Sunday nights and that we should have no problem being sat right away. Okay then- we decide to go. Get there just before 6 pm. There's a decent amount of customers in the restaurant, but nothing crazy. We go to the hostess stand and are told, \"Oh, well since we have to push two tables together, it's going to be a 45 minute wait.\" We were hesitant, but then looked at how many tables were open + how many people were leaving the restaurant and figured it wasn't going to even take 45 minutes (and probably wouldn't have anywhere else), so we put our names in and wait. And wait. And wait some more. Meanwhile, all these small parties of people walk in and are getting sat right away. During this time not once did either of the hostesses come to check in on us or say they were working to get a table together for us asap- just nothing. Finally, after an hour of waiting my other sister in law, husband, and their baby (my niece) have to leave because the baby is getting restless. THE WHOLE POINT OF US GOING WAS TO BE TOGETHER FOR OUR BIRTHDAY DINNER. So we go back to the hostess stand to let them know that our party is now going to be just a table of six. As we walk up to the hostess stand, the hostess literally looks over my fiancee's head to ignore him and sit another party that had literally just walked into the restaurant. I'm ready to leave and just go to Panera at this point, but we decide to stay. I wish I could say it got better from that point on, but sadly it did not. We were sitting for about 10-15 minutes before we were even acknowledged. Then as we're getting our drink order, my future father in law tries to order a beer, but our waiter interrupts him to tell him that the beer he wants is very similar to another beer and that he'll get him a taste of both (ummmmm okay?). So he goes back and gets our drinks. My future in law tastes both beers and orders the beer he originally tried to order to begin with. At this point we don't know how much longer we'll have to wait until the next time we'll see him, so we figure we need to order our food as quickly as possible. I we order appetizers. And wait. And wait. And wait. Finally, we get plates, only to realize that we weren't given enough plates. Oh, and at this point we don't have silverware or the beer my future father in law order. So we say something, finally get the amount of plates we need and the silverware. Still waiting on the beer. The beer finally arrives, but it's the wrong beer. Luckily, that gets fixed fairly quickly (and by fairly quickly, I mean we only wait 5-20 minutes before the correct beer is brought out). Finally, after being in the restaurant for almost 2 hours, our appetizer arrive. I wish I could say they were terrible, but they were pretty good. We had the chicken pot stickers and lettuce wraps. Then we got our food- oh, except for me because they messed up on it and our server surprisingly caught it and had it fixed. We finish our meals and then then bill came. We see that nothing was comped even though we had expressed our grievances throughout the dinner. At this point, I'm ready to scream, but miraculously hold it in. My future father in law says something to our server, who responds with \"oh, was it anything I did?\" Weird. But, we did end up getting some of our meal comped. The manager never came out to apologize or check in on us what-so-ever, so it's clear as to where the problems stem from. So, that was mine and my fiancee's birthday dinner...... The only reason that this is getting one star is because the food is good. Horrible service and there is clearly a management problem, but decent food. Sadly, it's not good enough for me to ever go here again.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here a few times and had good experiences.  So when my family was looking for a place to get together over the holidays I recommended BJ's.  This was a big mistake.  Our reservation was for 6:30 but the table was not ready until well after 7.  No problem, a few members of our party were late anyway so no harm no foul.  We had 16 people and it was busy that night so a few small errors in service would not have been a big deal.  Though, almost everyone had complaints.  Twice I ordered one of their beers only to have a server try to give me a mixed drink.  My cousin asked for a dish (cant remember) and was told they were sold out only to see the same order leave the kitchen numerous times afterwards.  One of our family members received the wrong dish, multiple items were forgotten and when the check came the servers proved completely incompetent in dividing the check between 3 groups.  While my sister tried to assist them in separating the bill one of the mangers stood there and did nothing to assist his struggling employees.    On our way out my sister approached two of the \"managers\" only to have one turn face and walk away from her and the other (younger guy) offered no explanation, no resolution, no nothing.  When she inquired further he at least offered to take her information and have someone follow up with an apology and possible gift card for our troubles ($500 bill by the way).  One month later we have heard nothing.  The food here is excellent and I may be back in small groups, but large groups should avoid BJ's like the plague.",

My mom had the deep dish baked ziti and loved it - although she thought it would have had more Alfredo sauce based on the description.   The pizookie was on special and we each got one for $3, hell of a deal. Mom had the monkey bread and I had the peanut butter s'mores and both were delightful.   We were very happy with the whole experience and I would choose BJ's over any other comparable chain (Texas Roadhouse, Outback, Longhorn). This was by far better than any of those.",

Clientele made up of families, groups of women and men sharing drinks and food. Essentially, your typical Pittsburgh suburb population demographic.    Our waiter, Canan, was friendly and attentive. He came out to let us know our food was coming very shortly after we ordered, which happened as scheduled.   I ordered what I believe was the enlightened Salmon Quinoa bowl; although it's listed with salmon alone, mine had shrimp as well. Tangy, tomatoey deliciousness characterized the sauce. Fish a bit bland, simply peppered on top, but the shrimp was deliciously savory-a buttery little addition of flavor.   Will need to come back and try other entrees, as well as sample that deliciously tempting Pizookie. Slightly underwhelmed, but optimistic!",

I haven't had a good service experience here yet. Our food has always been slow, and I usually have to track the sever down for a drink refill. One time, my husband and I drove separately because we met there, and we waited so long for our check that he left, and I sat for another 20 minutes waiting to close out our bill.

If you have been looking for a new place to try, since Friday's went out of business, I would recommend BJ's Brewhouse. They have many good appetizers, like the baked potato skins. I would recommend grabbing an appetizer there. The prices are about average and affordable. As I tip to future patrons, their menu has \"Poke\", but it's not actually the Pacific coast food that we all know and love which is also known as Poke. I however, would Not recommend their handcrafted sodas because they taste a bit sour.",

You get $5 off your bill once you download it. The bar staff was great while we waited and the service was quicker than expected.

Really top notch and a spot on the favorite pizza list.  New Orleans Jambalaya was excellent. Just the right amount of spicy.  Burgers were quite good. One was over cooked so only got an average review. The bacon cheeseburger was excellent.  Shoestring fries are great if that's your thing. If you like your fries more potatoey, these won't be your favorite.  Service was quite fast overall, though they did get a couple things wrong. No cheese on a burger, fries instead of salad as a side, etc. But not a huge deal. We will be back!",

    "text": "YOU NEED TO READ SOCIAL MEDIA!!! I had high hopes for your new restaurant, but since it opened, it's ratings on Yelp have been going steadily downhill. You need to bring in a professional management team to turn this new opening around. We were told an hour wait at 6:15 pm on a Saturday night, and though I noticed a lot of open tables sitting for quite a while, we weren't seated until 7:30 after I went up and pointed out an open booth. I like the setup, I like the menu, and actually, I could like the food. The beer selection is top notch as is the layout. We ordered an app of fried calamari, and the order was out exactly when the waiter took the order in. And it was barely luke warm. We sent it back, since a $9.95 app of calamari of that size better be spot-on. It's replacement came out 30 MINUTES later. And it could definitely have been more crispy and less greasy. And nothing close to an apology from anyone.  We had a table of 3, consisting of 2 burger orders and a salmon quinoa bowl. After our dinners were delivered 30 minutes after the appetizer was finished(!), no questions as to whether we needed anything else. Ketchup on the side? No offer. Sauce on the side that was ordered for the salmon  - no sign, and no one asking. Everyone was quite happy with the food - burgers, fries and salmon were all cooked perfectly. So the fault is NOT with the food. As we sat during our 3 hour and 15 minute experience, we noticed an awful lot of unoccupied tables and a continuing waiting crowd. That's lost revenue, especially after these people suffer bad service. I really think this is a reasonably easy fix, but you better get it done soon. Once a new restaurant gets a bad rap, it's very hard to overcome, especially with several new restaurants opening right in the same development. Since this is your first entry in the area, you may want to polish your local image.  Oh, and parking is horrendous. Who thought up building 3 restaurants in a row with a Trader Joe's in the middle, with a small shared parking lot?  Summary: decent menu, food good but could be way better, food delivery horrendous, table turnover and wait time estimate poor, wait staff inattentive, bar and draft selection above par.",

The waitress was initially nice, but when she found out that we were only ordering dessert she quickly lost her charm. She was rude and repeatedly gave us dirty looks throughout the night. Then when our food arrived, she returned with the check before we reached our 2nd bite.   2nd visit: Returned with a group of 8 for a birthday lunch. The drink orders were repeatedly wrong, the waiter had few manners when it came to reaching across the table and mixing up orders, and to top it off one of our guests was elbowed in the head by a passing staff member.   3rd visit: Five of us sat in the bar area to avoid the 2 hr wait to sit on a Monday night. The waitress (who I feel bad for) had to repeatedly apologize to us because she was the only staff member working the entire bar area. Meanwhile, there were 2 or 3 staff members just standing around by the kitchen door. It took a minimum of 15-20 minutes for her to make it back to our table. After the 20 minute wait to receive our drinks and get our orders in, we waited an hour for our food to come. We then had to request our checks when we ordered dessert because we had a movie to get to. When our checks finally came, they were all wrong. We also never had our waters refilled. And to top it off after the 2 hour ordeal we were late to get to the movie theater and it was sold out by that point. You'd think getting to a restaurant by 4:45 on a Monday would be plenty of time to make it to a 6:45 movie showing...clearly not.   I am very disappointed by this restaurant. They are now reaching the point where they can no longer use being a 'new' restaurant as an excuse. The service is horrendous and slow, and the food is mediocre at best.   The only reason I am giving them a 2 stars is because the beer is pretty good. Unfortunately, a good beer will only get you so far, and good beer paired with good food and staff can be found in MANY other places within a 15 minute radius.",

And then, when I ordered my beer the glass I got was cracked. then, after all massacre went down things just took a turn for the even worse. My chicken wings were served cold while the person I was with their meal was excruciatingly hot. Therefore I did not have a good experience here at bjs. And I will not be coming back and the name is far too dirty to even associate my children.",

    "text": "It had been a while since I had been here. It's usually quite crowded so not on my radar anymore. But I had a gift card so took my kids. It was Saturday so we did the \"preferred wait list\" before we arrived. The wait, I was told, would still be 20 minutes. It was probably only more like 5, which is good. I just don't understand what this waitlist even is. They should just use NoWait. So that part of the experience takes them down a notch.   The menu is huge and there is definitely something for everyone. I prefer the enlightened menu. It had a couple new dishes on it since my last visit. I tried the Moroccan chicken and swapped out the cauliflower for Brussels sprouts. The red pepper cream sauce was very good but the sprouts were undercooked and a bit difficult to eat. My kids enjoyed their chicken fingers and loved the garlic knot that came out for them before their meal. We shared a pizooki trio with the brownie sundae, cookies and cream and salted caramel. We all agreed the salted caramel was the best one.   I went on the app and they had a coupon going for $10 off if $40. They do couplings often so definitely check that before a visit.",

Hubby loves the pulled turkey dip (fashioned after the French dip sandwich but made with turkey instead of beef).  I always take a bite and it's always so good.  I like to roam around the menu- they always seem to have new menu items and this time I was thrilled to see a Nashville hot chicken sandwich!  Like I said it arrived cold but I popped it in my air fryer and it was delish.  I loved the pickles on it.  Both sandwiches came with French fries which I must say they make a mean French fry.  Thumbs up!  Other things I love - the avocado egg rolls the cheese curds, and their deep dish pizza.  You can't go wrong getting food from here and love that you can order from grubhub.",

We also had the HONEY SRIRACHA BRUSSELS SPROUTS (Crisp, lightly fried brussels sprouts | Big Poppa Smokers' Desert Gold seasoning | sweet sriracha crema) and they were delicious.  We agreed they paled in comparison to the zucchini strings, but they were delicious, also!  Service was good.

    "text": "My wife and I tried BJs for the first time on tax day. They had a deal for half off pizzas and we decided to give it a try.  Ordering the food online was not easy however. I placed an order for a large BBQ chicken pizza for pickup and to pay at the restaurant. I encountered 2 issues with this order: 1 the email receipt of the order I placed had listed a full price charge instead of the half off deal reflected on the website and 2 when I called to ask about this, I was told not to worry that the price would be adjusted at the restaurant when I came to pick up the food, but also that there were no large pizzas left and that I would be given a medium half off. This wasn't a big deal, but what is up with their online ordering for not getting the price right and then allowing an order for something that is out of stock?   Regardless the BBQ chicken pizza was Ok, not good or great. The bread on it was meh and for a pizza that had a little more bread on it than what I'm used to I had expected it to be better. The ingredients for the BBQ chicken pizza were decent and overall enjoyed trying it.  I'm not sure if I will be back here. I hear they have a very good pizzookie dessert which might get me to come back. I would not recommend the pizza at full price. I normally do not pay that price for a great pizza and would have been very disappointed to do so on this occasion.",

The portion size was good but the quality of the food was not that great. The steak was a bit hard and the rib was too spicy. Also, I think that the red wine was a bit turned ( a good punishment for a guy who orders wine in a beer place).  Overall I like the place.",

I started with a their own blend brew of BJ's red ale and angry orchard which I really enjoyed! When deciding what to order in a HUGE menu with options under every category, I was craving a salad. I considered myself somewhat of a BBQ chicken salad officienato so I decided to give theirs a try and it was one of the best I've ever had! Definitely recommend. My friend had the brisket bacon burger and said it was delicious. We finished by indulging in their specialty dessert known as the pizookie. Basically, a cookie of whatever flavor with ice cream on top! YUM! We kept it classic with a chocolate chip cookie.   Our service was mediocre and it took a really long time to get our dessert which was a bummer. But the atmosphere is nice, it's big inside, and has tons of TVs so it's a great place to hang out   *I'm updating my review because my service on my last visit was exceptional. We ordered wings as an appetizer and our meals came out first. Our waitress, the food runner, and the manager apologized and the wings were comped from our bill. Everyone makes mistakes, I just look for them to be acknowledged and made right and they went above and beyond to do that!*",

As an owner I have recruited 3 of my best employees by experiences in the public place. Their strong work ethics and ability to preform were incredible. Our server Cheyenne showed the same deep seated dedication in her service and strong work ethics. My company is in process of being sold. I will tell the new owner about Cheyenne. If I had more time as the owner I would recruit her myself. We have been regular customers since you opened but never had a reason to rate any other server.  She sincerely made out eating experience a good one. Food was outstanding!!!  Thank Kathy Melle",

    "text": "We have been twice over the past month. Had never been before. The first visit, service was poor. Waiter serving us was very low energy and just didn't seem to want to be there. The waiter serving the table next to us was running circles around ours, and smiled. The food was salty, salty, salty (beef sliders and the turkey dip) The draft beer menu is impressive. I ordered the Nutty Brewnette which was really good. Once we gave our main course order, I ordered a \"flight\" of beers. I literally asked for the flight to be sent along with main course 15 seconds after ordering. This seemed to annoy the waiter who said \"it's already been sent, I'll let them know.\" This was an odd claim because the waiter hadn't left our table yet and we were very close to the bar. On our second visit, the service was great. Our waitress was on point, energetic and welcoming. Unfortunately the food was salty again. I ordered beef sliders which tasted good, but one of them was literally the size of a quarter, like as if they ran out of beef. We also ordered the boneless wings which were terrible. The level of salt was truly unlike anything I've ever experienced. I drank plenty of water and could not finish even though I was hungry. If they could step up the food quality a bit and show some enthusiasm and knowledge of the craft beer menu, I'd be happy to give them another try. Sadly, I don't think we will be back a third time. They should try to emulate Gordon Biersch in my opinion.",

Our server didn't start off well as when our hostess was seating us, I overheard her say \"you better find someone else to take these tables cause I'm not doing it\".  That didn't exactly start if off right for us.  I was a party of 6 with my family so I was a little surprised to hear that on a Tuesday night that wasn't packed.  I would have thought this would be welcomed, but I guess I was wrong.  Anyhow, the food was okay.  We got garlic parm wings to start and they weren't amazing.  I have had some that were amazing and these were okay.  The flavor was a little lacking but all in all okay.  Each of us got the hickory brisket burger.  I thought it was again average.  It sounded awesome on the menu, but the bbq flavor I tasted was more from the sauce than the brisket.  Again, a little better than average.  So basically my experience was okay.  I would go back to see if it was more about our server rather than the total experience but also would like to try more menu items.",

The phone recording clearly states they take reservations for 7 or more. Young lady who answered took my information and said she needed to check with a manager to verify availability and I would receive a phone call within 24 hours. Thursday comes and no word so I call back & there is no record of my info from Wed call. So I leave my info again. They say I will receive a call Friday morning to confirm & to \"stay by the phone.\" Friday, the day we are requesting the reservation for 7:30, 3:00 PM comes and no confirmation call. I call again & there is no record of our reservation. I was exasperated. I explained all of the above to Terry & she assured me she was personally pencilling us in. When the first of our party arrived they were told it would be  another half hour & they don't take reservations for parties of 7 (it clearly states on their recording they do.) Anyhow we were seated by 7:30. They pack you in! The service was wonderful, food good. They were very accommodating by bringing out the Birthday cake we had brought w  candles lit- no annoying Birthday song! I would recommend going here again but if you make a reservation, follow up because the staff doesn't seem to know how to do it.",

Time to retire that look, it's been done to death at the Rock Bottom, Dave & Buster's,  and hundred of other chains. Want to see a beautiful ceiling while drinking beer, head to the Church Brew Works.   BJ's is located in the new McCandlis Crossing off McKnight road. Another giant hodge podge of Ethan Allens, Super Cuts, Trader Joe's (this is Pennsylvania, no two Buck Chuck, TJ Brew or Trader Joe's Cafe) and other boring chain places that dot the western Pennsylvania landscape. BJ's is new to Pittsburgh, a brewery/restaurant/bar miss mash with their beer as the star of the show. Stopped in with a friend, had a double IPA, not bad, tasty, hoppy, floral in the front, hints of lime, grapefruity finish. 5.75 a pint, my friend loves stouts and enjoyed their version. We'd eaten before stopping in for a nightcap but did look the menu over. The large menu reminds me of the Cheesecake Factory, lots of choices, lots of calories, a few lighter menu items caught my eye like the salmon over quinoa & vegetables, at 1050 calories, I didn't find that very light. Fish tacos, flatbread, deep dish pizza, and burgers make up the bulk of this menu.   One thing did catch my eye though, they carry brews from other breweries, including the Pius Monk Dunkle from Church Brew Works. Kind of odd to carry brews from other local brew houses, IMO. In a world of chain restaurants, when something new pops up give it a try.",

This night seemed a little more crazy than usual as it was 3 dollar pizookie day and unfortunately, there was some issues with our food. It was about 7 o clock (we had a movie at 7:20) when I asked my waiter (devin I believe was his name) to check on our food. A short while later, the manager (Jen) comes out and explains that the steak I ordered was burnt and she couldn't let them serve me it. She was so apologetic and professional about the situation. We explained that we had a movie in about 15 minutes. She not only got us our food in record time, but bought our dinner and gave us free pizookies. To top it all off, we ended up not missing a single minute of our movie. While the movie was less than spectacular, the service and attitude of the employees that night exceeded all my expectations and proves just why bjs is my favorite place.",

    "text": "My friend brought me here after a recent interview I had in the area. There was a bit of a wait so we grabbed a beer at the bar and I was happy to see that they had a large selection. Lots of craft choices were available. Once sat, our waitress was very attentive and answered a few questions for us. We placed our orders and got another beer each. Everything went quickly and the service was great. We put in for an appetizer which came out very fast. The Avocado Egg Rolls were very tasty and a great starter. I ordered the Crispy Jalapeno Burger with fries. The burger was decent but I had to ask for extra sauce. There wasn't enough to even taste initially. The fries however were of the shoestring variety which I like but the were cooked to a crisp and were stiff and crunchy. Way overdone. I asked for a side of Chipotle Mayo to dip them in which helped a bit but over all they were just bad.  There is a lot of potential for what I ordered but it just missed the mark a little bit on this visit. I do like the atmosphere and beer selection. I will make a return trip and try something different on my next trip.",

Servers are new and eager but some kinks need to be worked out. Great positive attitudes though so, no doubt improvements will happen over time.   Beers and hard cider were great and large amount of selections on menu.  Calamari came with two dipping sauces that were tasty separately and together  Crusted chicken dinner was wonderful but side dish veggie of broccoli was skimpy on amount.   Tortilla soup is amazing - definitely get some just make sure you get a spoon with it lol.  They make a great presentation of pouring the soup into your bowl which contains tortilla strips and a few other things but forgot my spoon - not a big deal but it took three requests just to get a spoon and it was darn worth it with that soup!  Jambalaya is awesome and pretty spicy.   Will try this place again. Especially because my fiance loved the craft beers.   Oh, I really liked the decorations of framed pics with a vintage vibe. Nice place! Happy vibe.",

They were pretty good, but there was not enough filling for all of the lettuce they gave us (I am talking about a scoop per lettuce piece if even that). Tasted pretty good though, but nothing spectacular.   As a main ordered the barbacoa bowl and my husband had the fish tacos. The bowl was okay but extremely salty. I probably shouldn't have ordered that at a place like this (I should just stick to chipotle for that stuff). My husband said the fish tacos were just average. Maybe we should have stuck to their pizza or burgers thought.   I ordered their peach beer which I enjoyed as well.   Overall, average food, good beer selection, great place to watch a game. We would give this place another go.",

My husband got a crispy chicken salad.  The service was slow.  When we finally got our food, they brought out my salad with salmon on it....not the shrimp which I ordered.  So then I had to wait another 15 minutes.  The salad was good.  I like the large menu.  Plenty of choices.  Even with as little people there, the place is noisy.  Kind of hit and miss there as I ate there awhile back and they got my order right.",

She was great and by no means does she deserve a one star. The peanut butter s'mores pizookie was also quite good - albeit a bit sickeningly sweet.   I don't even know how this many bad things  are possible in one meal, but it happened -gritty guacamole with an overwhelming and strange sour flavor in it (are they squeezing a fresh lime into this?), lip puckering levels of salt on tortilla chips, a \"porter\" beer that was like a watery, flavorless, and flat soft drink and of course the \"star\" of this evenings failure - the 14.95 ahi tuna salad - about 6 pieces of 1 inch tuna and some greens with giant tomato chunks and greasy wonton strips all soaked to death in the most disgusting dressing I have ever tasted. To top it off my salad bowl was covered with some inexplicable green powder sprinkle that also tasted bad - I ate the tuna squares and left the rest. I can probably count on one hand the number of times I have left a full plate in a restaurant and unfortunately tonight was one of them.   So disappointing. Sadly, I can't see myself ever seeking this place out as a choice I will ever want to spend my money at. Third time was a charm for me.",

Service was polite, but ultimately crappy, because we had one very nice, very kind waitress who was in charge of over a dozen fully-loaded tables all by herself (not her fault, but strike one star).  Had the mozz sticks (meh) and the Sriracha-drizzled Brussel sprouts (something new), which I probably would have enjoyed more if they hadn't lost that battle with Smaug before they came out (practically charred black).  What wasn't burnt black was very tasty, but they clearly swore revenge as they went down (the aftertaste lingered for HOURS after and the gas was...  OMG it required apologies).  Anyhoo...  my main entree was the mushroom-swiss burger and fries with a side of BBQ sauce.  The food was accurate, but we waited forever, and everything but the fries came out room-temperature, due the above-mentioned service/staffing problem.  The bright spot?  The fries!  The fries were a wonderful surprise: long, salty, super-thin straws of crispy, potatoey goodness. Om-nom-nom!!  Oh, and that side of BBQ sauce was amazing.  All-in-all, I recommend going and will try this place again myself, but make sure that it's during a time when they're not so understaffed.",

I'll say we'll split the difference at 2.   *Editors notes: I might have written the better part of a mark twain novel here, so I apologize.  8:30pm - walked in to the restaurant with my lady friend, greeted kindly by the hostess. \"Just going to sit at the bar, thanks\".   8:31pm - sat at a pair of open seats at the 60% occupied bar. DIRECTLY in the middle. Easy enough.   8:32pm - bartender, who is a slightly younger than middle aged woman, passes by my area, and without stopping, turns her head to say \"make sure to get your IDs out\"  Strange, I think, because even though I'm relatively young, my lady friend and I are both in our late 20's. Haven't been asked to order anything at this point, mind you. The tone of this premature ID request was a bit accusatory, prompting me to think, \"it's like a damn police state.\" \"Do I need an ID if I was ordering soda?\"  8:40 pm - \"do you know what you want?\"  \"Yes\" I reply. Lady friend orders, I order, \"piranha pale ale please\".  \"Have you had this before?\" \"Uh, yes?\" Strange question. She asks \"would you like to try it?\" \"No, I'll just order one\".  8:43pm- drinks arrive. \"May we also have a menu?\" \"Sure\". Menus are acquired.  9:00pm - (this is 15 minutes later) ready to order. Awkwardly opening my menu, closing my menu, placing my menu closer towards the bar, stacking both menus. Every common \"sign\" that a table is ready to order. Eye contact with bartender established, signs of hope, then hope is lost as I spend the next 10 minutes watching bartender pass back and forth, awkwardly avoiding eye contact.  9:10 - starting to get irritated. Aside from shouting at bartender vs. lighting myself on fire in protest, I can't seem to afford her attention. Getting too uncomfortable and awkward to order. We determine that unless we're acknowledged in 5 minutes, away we go.  9:20 - my 5 minutes turned to 10, I finally lean over the bar, and ask for the check. \"Sure\". Check arrives. I pay in exact change, leaving a $1 tips per drink. $2 in total extra on a $13.11 tab. We take our leave.  9:21 - I'm across the street, being seated at Burgatory, where I had a delightful experience before a 10:30 movie. I will be going to Burgatory from now on.  Moral of the story, I'm PAYING you for food and drink, don't make me work that damn hard for it. The food is standard American chain restaurant fare, although not bad by any means, not worth being unappreciated as a patron.",

Pretty busy for a Thursday night which in turn meant a pretty long wait before our first beer arrived. Host and waitress were both pleasant but the food this time out was just OK.  Brussel sprouts weren't crispy like they were during our first trip. My buddy ordered the Chicago style pizza and it looked good as that's what I had the first time around.  My meal however was pretty forgettable, and I knew I shouldn't have ordered it. I had the Parmesan crusted chicken with mashed potatoes and broccoli. Considering you can get a comparable meal at most chain restaurants this was the most bland version I've ever had.  Everything was just a bit dry. Chicken was saved only by the toppings but I barely touched the mash potatoes. My side salad I started with was fine albeit I hate when they load up on croutons.  I'll certainly be back but I think I'll stick to pizza or bar food in the future and avoid the entrees.",

Started slow but at least not as bad as last time, and our server got the orders correctly.  The hubby and I shared the 2 for $25, which includes a soup/salad, medium pizza and pizookie.  I had a cesar salad and hubby had the house wedge salad that has bacon, tomatoes, & vinaigrette dressing.  Both were what you would expect.  We had the BJs favorite deep dish (peperroni, sausage, mushrooms, green peppers, onions, olives).  It was delish, but don't get it if you dislike raw and chunky veggies.  It was lacking in the meats though.    The salted caramel pizookie was the highlight.  I'd say the 2 for $25 is a good portion for 2 people.  We had pizza leftovers.  We also had a very berry margarita (strong but tasty) and a wildberry mojito (pretty good).  Cocktails are pricey.  Happy hr is $1 off drinks.  I didn't see the 2 for $25 on the menu, so you would have to ask the server if they are offering it when you go.  One thing I noticed that's different here from other BJs is that the servers do not ask about your interest in the pizookie until you're done w/ dinner.  I can understand that that's probably more with etiquette.  At other BJs, they ask you in the beginning so they can time the pizookie perfectly since it is made to order.  I hope this place keeps improving in service.",

Quality control.... every server had a corporate trainer/shadow.  Kitchen -- all cooks and su chef had a corporate trainer/shadow.  Manager, Brian Torgerson, was all over the place for day 1... Beverages were as advertised, beers fine and most \"local,\" food well managed in presentation.    Honestly, I do not like chains... but this one seems to break that mold a bit by focusing on servers with people skills, then training them, and supporting them for nearly a month!   This model/template for chains is to be understand and respected.      A dozen big screens.  Bar seating excellent.  Great parking.  Visibility from route 19.  ...    A nice place for many reasons.",

I thought it looked nice on the outside but once you walk into the foyer, you know that this place isn't messing around. Such a sophisticated yet casual environment. You can go for a casual lunch with friends or a classy dinner with some co-workers.   They have a huge bar area with a wall of liquor, planked by two massive televisions. Perfect for any sports go-er.   In general, it IS a brewhouse and they have an endless list of craft beers. They even have a ranking/rating system of the beers on the menu that tells you what each beer is well paired with.   I thought the Cheesecake Factory had the biggest and best menu... but I must say, BJ's is going to give it a run for its money. It took be awhile to figure out what exactly I wanted, which is a good thing. They literally have anything and everything: burgers, tacos, deep-dish pizza, fish, fried chicken, etc.   At first introduction, the staff was a little too up-front and personal with me but my waiters ended up being super nice and sociable. Very knowledgable about the menu and especially the beer!  They even have a mobile app where you can pay right on the app, rather than with your server. The app also utilizes a point system that earns you rewards over time.   I recommend this restaurant 100%.",

With the app you may also pay through your phone.  By paying this way you will receive a 20% discount off your bill.  We had zero wait time!  To drink I ordered the peach berry iced tea (non-alcoholic).  It was very light and refreshing. The refills were free!  I had the barbeque pulled pork sandwich with shoestring french fries.  The sandwich was delicious.  The pork was tender, the onion straws were crispy, and the sauce was both sweet and smokey.  The downfall of the meal was the fries.  While crispy and flavorful they were also cold.   My only regret is that I was too full to try one of their exciting desserts!  Next time I plan on getting a dessert and maybe trying one of their many craft beers.",

    "text": "BJ's has been around for a while, and I've always wanted to go.  I don't eat at chain restaurants often, but every once in a while I do.  Their specialty is pizza and beer, and I was expecting a lot from BJ's and came away not impressed, but it wasn't awful.  The good: The fried portabella fritters were awesome.  They were crunchy with a lot of breading, but there was a lot of portabella in each fritter.  Dip it in ranch dressing and it's a match made in heaven.    The pizza crust was excellent.  It was a deep dish pizza  and the crust was light, fluffy, and buttery.  The bad: I got the BJ's Classic Combo pizza, which contained mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, tomatoes, mushrooms, sausage, and pepperoni.  The sausage was okay, but could have been better and lacked flavor(needed more fennel).  The mozzarella was actually pretty good.  What killed the pizza for me was the pepperoni.  The pepperoni looked like it came from the supermarket and was not high quality to me.  If I'm going to pay 15 bucks for a small pizza, I want to have quality ingredients all around.    Overall, the food was okay.  They need to get better pepperoni.",

    "text": "My wife and I visited this restaurant for lunch Saturday, December 9 , 2017.  We were able to get a table easily. The restaurant has a pleasant contemporay vibe. The decor is modern-bland, but totally acceptable.   We looked at the beer menu, and found it to be overpriced with 16oz setting you back +$6. Beer from other breweries were similarly priced. So, they have elected to overcharge for their own brews, favoring high profit margin over promoting their own brand. Compare this to 16oz at my local Rivertowne brewery for $3.50. Wine prices are average. A glass of Kendall Jackson chardonnay is priced in the mid $9 range.  Food: we elected to split a California Chicken Club Sandwich (our appetites aren't what they were in our 20's). The sandwich arrived promptly, and that is where the good experience ended. It looked fine on top. I bit into my sandwich to encounter a bitter taste. I turned the sandwich over to discover that the bottom of the sandwich was totally black ... having been carbonized to a uniform layer of glossy black charcoal. I considered sending it back, but time constraints stopped us from doing. I wanted to take a picture, but my hands were so covered in grease at this point, I didn't want to reach into my pocket for my phone ... anyway, to visualize it, think of the glossy sheen of Darth Vader's helmet. I scraped the charcoal off the sandwich, my wife simply discarded her burned bread, and found the remaining product to be tasteless and bland.  We will not be returning to this restaurant. They obviously have poor quality control, and there are plenty of better choices for your restaurant dollars.",

You could come here on a Tuesday at 4:00 in a snow storm and you would have to wait 45 minutes to be seated. But the menu is an endless book of creative and delicious lunch, dinner, dessert & drink options! I've been here many times and have ordered something different every single time. I have never been disappointed. The staff treats their customers very well and they have a rewards program if you download their app! I could eat here every day and not get tired of it.",

My in-laws were in for the week and on their first night we decided to try BJs because we are also new to the area . We called to place our name on the call ahead list. I called and asked if we could be added to the list at 6:30. The call to be placed on the list was took place at 5:35. We got to the restaurant at 6:25 and said we were on the list for 6:30.  The hostesses then proceeded to tell us it would still be a 50-60 wait! I was shocked ! I had a 3 year old in the party. I wouldn't have been upset had they told us this when we called, but there was NOTHING said in the initial call.  Give us the opportunity to choose to be there and get the chance to eat someone else.
