Once I received my order I briefly checked to make sure that my order was correctly filled and then left to meet a friend elsewhere since all the tables and seats were full. What I was not expecting, was a charred Chicken Frontega Panini -- despite the busyness of a weekday I cannot believe they had the audacity to serve such inedible food. though I had a to-go order and the priority is to provide fast service, I would've rather waited an extra 5 minutes for an edible Frontega chicken panini - as long as I was told (otherwise I'd be in the dark about the extra long wait for a measly Frontega chicken). By all means, the other half of the panini was great, but would've been better had I got to enjoy the entire sandwich that I paid $8 for.",

    "text": "Hey, a Panera is a Panera. I have fond memories of this one just because it's located near Pitt, where I attended college; I would meet a number of friends for dinner here and even interview people for the school paper here. Good times!  However, no Panera is perfect. The biggest drawback to this Panera is its location. The service is wonderful and the food is as good as it is at any other Panera, but unfortunately if it's time for the midday/dinner rush nothing will save you from getting lost in the swarm of students and staff members all looking to get a yummy sandwich or bowl of soup. It's always good to have a back-up plan in case the line is really long here - fortunately it's Oakland, so there's no shortage of alternative eateries. Also: if you want parking, try the Panera that's along Boulevard of the Allies; that one has a parking lot, but this one does not.  On the plus side, in recent years this Panera's added a LOT of new space to accommodate the population it feeds, which is wonderful; it doesn't do much to help when you're standing in line, but at least once you get your food you have a greater chance of finding a table hidden in the back corner and you can use the wi-fi in relative peace. Still, fair warning: extra space or not, be ready to compete with a massive student population if you want to sit in here.  One final note and tip: if you're looking to host a class or meeting here, go for it: this Panera, (like many, it seems) has a nice meeting room that's separate from the main dining area. The one here is almost constantly in use - that's how popular this place is. Everyone likes Panera in Oakland, I guess!",

I'm not sure if it was because of the deal (I've only been on weekends before), but there was quite a line when I went around 7 pm. The wait time to order and for the food to be ready wasn't bad, though.  I'll probably be back only for this deal--there are plenty of other places that will give more food for less money.",

I've been here quite a few times for lunch and in between writing sessions in the library. It's always quite busy, particularly during semesters, and sometimes it's a bear to wait in line for a while. The quality of the food is always good, and the staff seem competent and friendly. I've been disappointed here a few times that the types of bagels I want are not available later in the afternoon. Sometimes, there are only a couple of types of bagels left as early as 3pm. I wish they had a variety of bagels available throughout the entire day rather than \"while supplies last.\" Overall, though, I enjoy this place and will continue to frequent. Their black bean soup is amazing.",

Bizarre! The only reason this place is still in business is because they have a nice seating area and it is one of the only restaurants available on Pitt's campus. This location also has mice.....",

I always avoid coming here for that reason but there's tons of tables, is in a convenient location, free WiFi and the environment can be nice. The service is always quick and they always get my order right.   The 25% love is for their bakery goods. Their brownies are out of this freaking world and I know that they are baked fresh every morning. None of their other food are, even if they claim to be. Baked fresh every morning.   I only come here when I feel like using my points from the Pocket Points app because then you can get BOGO You Pick 2; which makes it a little more affordable because then I have enough food to feed me for two meals.

    "text": "This is probably the worst Panera I have ever been to. My bagel arrived in three separate chunks, not nicely cut. I had asked for a cream cheese bagel and the bagel came without cream cheese spread on and instead little packets of cream cheese that were hard. I will never come back to this Panera. I highly recommend finding a different cafe.",
