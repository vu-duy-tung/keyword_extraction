The staff seemed overwhelmed and it was difficult to get things ordered.   Food came out at weird intervals and ordering green tea was a 45 minute wait?????   Nakama use to be better.....probably won't be back.",

The gentleman paid $100 for his tab and he was clearly really drunk and when they gave him his change he only gave him $6 dollars back and when he confronted the bartender about it he had the rest of his change sitting on top of the register. This was extremely awarkward to watch someone being taken advantage of and to see the bartenders face when he caught him was something unreal. Really messed up when you go to a nice restaurant like Nakama and have an employee do something like that. Really makes you think twice of going there in the future ( or makes you realize that you need to count your money because there are people out there like that )",

They own a great spot in Southside though so the prominent location creates dominant control of people's eyes and ears.    Got to Yokoso.",

Then again, why would you want to bring a date here since you will have a hard time talking to him/her since this place is so noisy.  The Hibachi chef that we ended up with looked like a Mexican that could hardly speak English.  His skill sucks and couldn't even do the onion volcano correctly.

    "text": "I used to love nakama and would go all the time. Unfortunately, I will not be going back. The main reason for this is mostly due to the fact that they charge you $4 more for fried rice and don't even include noodles. Meanwhile their prices for most of the hibachi meals are already higher compared to saga or ichiban. Secondly our chef was super average. He didn't do anything cool and didn't even acknowledge that their was a little girl's birthday at our table. But I cannot stress enough how ridiculous it is that they charge you for fried rice. No other hibachi restaurant ever does that, and if they do they at least provide you with noodles. So I ordered the filet mignon and that came with dry terrible white rice and a small portion of vegetables and that came to $28.50.  If you go 5 miles down the road you can go to ichiban and they will give you a combo meal of filet and shrimp with fried rice and noodles for 27.95. Unreal rip off.",

    "text": "I have to say, I was not super impressed by this place at all. I have been wanting to try Nakama since I moved to Pittsburgh in 2011, but I never got around to going. My overall impression is that this place is spectacularly average, and extremely overpriced. Dishes range from $30-$40 on average, unless you order the Kobe Steak dish, which is a whopping $70. Wow. I went on a Sunday night, so it was not crowded or loud as I'm sure it is on weekends, being in such a prime location on the south side. We were seated right away and our server was polite, friendly and fast. No problems there.   We got a sushi appetizer that was delicious and fresh, but it was pretty expensive for the quantity. I have had good sushi for cheaper, and this became the theme of the night: \"it's good, but why is it so expensive?\" I did not find, as other reviewers have said, that this was the best sushi in the city. It was very good. It was high quality, but it was not the best, and it was expensive.   I ordered the tuna steak hibachi, and my boyfriend ordered a spicy steak hibachi dish. Hibachi orders at this place include the typical salad and miso soup, as well as an appetizer of either mushrooms or shrimp. I will say that the miso soup was the best I have ever had a joint like this. It was flavorful and had more mushrooms than usual. The salad was typical. The shrimp appetizer consists of 3 small pieces of shrimp. While I greatly appreciated the extra snack, this addition does not really justify the price difference between this and other hibachi places.   Our chef was perfectly capable, but not fun or talkative at all. Maybe it's not considered classy or upscale, but I like to have fun when I go to a place like this, and I appreciate chefs who make jokes, get creative, and talk to us while they're cooking. Our chef made good food, but he barely talked at all, and didn't really do anything exciting. He did the onion tower, but that's about it.   The food was good, but nothing spectacular. My favorite thing was my boyfriend's spicy dish, because it came with these really delicious thick noodles. The spicy sauce is a creamy orange sauce that still has a lot of kick. It was delicious, actually. I wish I ordered that. The tuna steak was fine, but nothing to write home about.   Overall, my experience was perfectly fine at this place, but when I pay this much for a meal I expect more than just an acceptable experience. There are plenty of places in and around the city where you can get similar meals for much cheaper. I probably won't go here again.",

If you go here, they have very tasty lunch entrees, that's it, and be ready for iffy service. I went last week and sat at the bar in clear view of the bartender who was too busy playing on his phone to greet me. I got a sashimi platter and boston roll. I ate two pieces of sashimi, the second bite I had to spit into a napkin, I couldn't bring myself to swallow it. The boston roll was okay, but not very cool. Even the sashimi was above room temp and very fishy and just bad. I'm a service industry employee myself, you have to be pretty shitty for me to give a bad review....it was that bad, sorry bout it :(",

    "text": "So I was recently in town as part of that annual convention involving tails and ears (If you're from Pittsburgh I'm sure you know what I'm talking about!)  Anyways, my friends and I decided to give this place a go on the last night as a final hurrah. Folks who had been dealing for the convention were running late getting their trucks packed up so we didn't even get to the restaurant until after 9:30 PM.  We called and asked if they would still do the hibachi grill for our party and they were very welcoming of us and said sure, absolutely! So despite getting there so late we all got treated to a fabulous meal and a fun show, we're all thankful not just to Nakama but to the whole city of Pittsburgh for welcoming us to their city every year!  On to the food, I tried their Diablo Seafood hibachi which was shrimp and scallops cooked up with udon noodles in a spicy sauce. It was very unique from the other hibachi meals due to the noodles and spicy sauce so my order had to be cooked last but it was more than worth it. Everything was delicious, the spicy sauce actually makes you sweat a little bit but certainly is not over powering. My girlfriend had some hibachi steak and, well, any time you got a beautiful cut of meat cooked up right in front of you like that you just know it's going to melt in your mouth.  Everything was great, we're already talking about coming back to Nakama next year, hopefully at a much earlier time in the day though. Thanks again!",

    "text": "I've been to Nakama three times in the last four years, and I have to say I've had some mixed experiences from visit to visit. Nothing outright horrendous, but I've never had a perfect meal here, either.  During my first visit a family member and I sat by the window and enjoyed a quiet meal on a Saturday afternoon. My only complaint then was that there were no indications about just how big each order of sushi on the menu was; as a result we ended up putting in a second round of orders to fill up our stomachs, because round one was pretty light. (This problem still exists - they don't specify how many rolls you get next to every item or even in the section header. My orders have definitely ranged in size over the years and it's really hard for me to judge how big their rolls are without images or numbering. Special rolls in particular are rarely the same size as regular rolls since they have special ingredients.)  At dinner during my second visit I couldn't hear anyone in my dinner group over the grills, voices and music. The food was ok but the main thing I remember about the evening is leaving with a headache from the noise.   And my third and most recent visit, while mostly good, still wasn't quite spot on. On the plus side, presumably since it was a Monday evening it was relatively quiet and there was no loud or obnoxious music being blasted throughout the place. The chef making our dinner was very nice, he let his technique wow us and do most of the talking for him, and he occasionally engaged in polite conversation with us. I loved watching and listening to this gentleman and he was a huge improvement over the flirtatious comedic wannabe I dealt with at the last hibachi place I went to, which will remain nameless. The drink I ordered was delicious and based on the samplings I had from my family's meals, the hibachi orders were perfect - the meat was tender and juicy and everything was seasoned for flavoring and cooked just the way everyone wanted them. But like I said, the meal wasn't spot on. My sushi, the Hawaiian roll, was ok, although I wish there had been more tempura evenly distributed throughout it. Our waitress actually messed up part of my order - I got a plate of salmon roll instead of the salmon cake, but I had waited long enough for my food while watching my family's hibachi being made that I didn't feel like complaining about it and sending it back. (On that note, if you come as a group, know that hibachi and normal orders never arrive anywhere near the same time. Order appetizers if you don't want to sit at the table drooling as your friends or family's dinner cooks in front of you.)  I've definitely never had an outright bad experience at Nakama and the food has always been tasty enough, particularly the hibachi - but honestly I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here and it'll probably be another year or two before I stop by again. And while Nakama hasn't completely and utterly disappointed me, it just haven't \"wowed\" me yet, either.",

First with my sushi review: I have been here multiple times for sushi and liked the bar set up and thought the sushi tasted fresh and the service was quick. Good for happy hours (especially Thursday specials) or dates. However I don't like how if you only want to order sushi you have to sit at the bar. It makes it impossible to go there as a group or you end up waiting forever if there aren't enough seats in the bar area.. when the entire back room could be open.   The reason for my 2-star review is the hibachi, something that is pretty standardized among restaurants, but Nakama didn't have any of it right the time I went. The miso soup tasted like the packet cup of soup you buy in college. I ordered the shrimp and it turned out tough and rubbery. I also tried some of my friend's steak, which was also well done and dry. The hibachi chef didn't even ask how she wanted it to be cooked. Also, even though it's similarly priced to other hibachi restaurants, you have to up charge for fried rice and don't even have the option of noodles.  Bottomline: go to Nakama in small groups for sushi but stay away from the Hibachi",

    "text": "The fascination with Nakama has always left me confused. I'm not a huge hibachi fan, so my gripes truly rest with the sushi. As far as sushi goes, Nakama simply doesn't deserve the praise that it gets. Granted, when they first opened, the food was decent, but even back then it was never a truly great sushi place.  Now, if you like your sushi over-saturated in sauces, then you might enjoy it, but all too often, the rolls are soggy, poorly rolled, and the fish quality isn't as good as you'd expect if you were judging the restaurant from the outside. Blame it on the pace with which the chefs have to prepare it...blame it on them hiring inexperienced sushi chefs. Whatever it is, it's just not up to par with some of the other sushi places in Pittsburgh. In fact, the sushi at the Tokyo Buffet on McKnight is just as good...AND THAT'S A BUFFET!  Regardless, it's always packed, and I'm a huge fan of seeing businesses succeed in town, but Nakama is truly a place that's gained too much from its trendy status. Unfortunately, I'm all about the food, so after you enjoy a good martini and enjoy the little hibachi show, what you're left with is the reality that the food is second priority to those other two parts.  The hibachi is fine, but it's nothing special...of course, when is hibachi ever truly a special experience, taste-wise? It's just a buttery fried rice fest in your mouth. The best hibachi I've ever had at Nakama was the ahi tuna...the cut of fish was actually fresher than sashimi that I've ordered there, and keeping it seared, but rare in the middle kept it from drying out. Or maybe that was just the butter...either way, it's by far the one thing that I've walked away with good feelings about.  The sashimi cuts that I've had have rarely satisfied. Fresh fish shouldn't taste so fishy, and for what you pay, they should be serving up better cuts. The sushi menu is interesting enough that you'll be able to find what you're looking for, but it's truly a hit-or-miss experience when the sushi hits your taste buds.  Overall, Nakama is the hot spot where you meet your friends before hitting the clubs and make random friends over some happy hour drinks, but if you're looking for a quality meal, I'd enjoy the drinks and move on to any number of better restaurants nearby.",

The waiter did nothing else and management did not come over.

All he did was toss some high sodium sauce on some veggies and meat, stir them around, and serve them on our plates.  My stomach hurt less than 1 hour after I ate there...'nuff said.",

    "text": "So...  I usually only eat in the Sushi bar/bar area because I am not into the whole hibachi thing.  This place is usually very busy for Happy Hour, so if you just want to eat and not worry about a crowd, try a different place or come at a different time.  Otherwise, it can be amusing to people watch here.    Personally, I come for the Sushi.  Ever since my friend introduced me to the Hanalei roll, I can't resist it.  Shrimp tempura, cream cheese, some other stuff, then tempura batter fried.  Tastes so much better than it sounds, worth the $14 price tag (if done right) as it is double the standard sized roll.  The other rolls are all decent and the sashimi servings are huge.  If you are on a first date, beware - the pieces of sushi are so gigantic that you'll either 1) look like a pig stuffing it all into your mouth or 2) risk having the entire piece fall apart all over you as you try to daintily take normal bite sizes out of the sushi-piece.  You decide whether you will go for option 1 or 2!  Oh, and just say NO to the tempura appetizer.  It's not tempura, that would actually be Japanese style.  No, what you will get if you order the tempura is American-style beer-battered shrimp and 3 pieces of vegetables, all for 11 bucks.  Blech.  Service is always a bit shoddy in the bar area, but to be fair, that place gets crazy busy.  So...  Food, 4; Service 2-3 depending on the night and business; atmosphere, 3.  But hey, if you just want that busy happy hour scene, this is a place to go to!  P.S.  Parking can be a pain.  It's Carson in the Southside, what do you expect?",

I've never liked any seafood but their shrimp appetizer is so good! The only place I'd ever eat seafood (besides my occasional bouts with sushi).  I got Chicken & Steak hibachi dinner all three times I've been there. I got filets the third time for the steak and it was worth the extra three dollars.  It is kind of sad that the performance of the hibachi chefs varies a lot from person to person, as the second time I went was by far the nicest to watch, but all three were very good.  This is my birthday restaurant now. ;)",

    "text": "I go here a few times a month, mostly because I think the bar scene is probably one of the most fun in Pittsburgh.   It gets pretty crowded especially on the weekends, but the staff does a good job especially after you go there a few times and they know who you  are.  It's the only place I know of in Pittsburgh that on any given day (even a monday or tuesday) there will be a good crowd at the bar with a higher girl to guy ratio than the usual dudefest at most bars.  The hibachi is better than most.  It's definitely better than benihana, but probably not as good as Shogun in Monroeville.  The only thing I don't like about the hibachi (or any hibachi) is that after the meal you smell like a diner short order cook because of the oil from the grill.  The other menu items are pretty average at best.  The marinated beef tips and chicken lettuce wraps are okay appetizers.  The edaname is pretty hard to mess up and the miso soup is about average.  The sushi is awful.  I mean I guess the rolls are edible, but you can hide the quality by adding a lot of junk to cover up the flavor.  The sashimi (whish is really all that I order) I found to be really poor quality and the way it was sliced was not at all how sashimi should be sliced.  I really don't understand how this place wins best overall restaurant and best sushi  in Pittsburgh.  It really makes no sense.  Most of the people I know agree that the hibachi is good, but overall the restaurant isn't that good and the sushi not good at all.  However, I have a  friend who is one of the chefs assures me that the quality of ingredient is good.  Overall, I suggest if you eat here the hibachi is pretty good and fun if  you are having a sit down dinner.  If you are eating at the bar try to stick to the edamame or maybe one of the appetizers mentioned.  I strongly suggest staying away from the sushi, but if you  must stick to the most basic of rolls (california roll, etc.).  In fact, if you are not sitting down for hibachi go eat at Dish on the same street and head to Nakama only for the bar.",

I normally get only broccoli for my veg bc I am a picky eater. Never had a problem at any other place or extra charge but they wanted to charge me an extra $4 to get just broccoli .... I can buy an entire bag of broccoli for $4. The steak was good though. Yum yum sauce was okay. Service was good.

    "text": "This was my first time dining at Nakama, and our experience was less than ideal. I first made the mistake of believing I could have a calm and quiet meal here on a Saturday night. The restaurant was very loud and hectic. We were seated at a hibachi table with six (clearly intoxicated) people after being denied a non-hibachi table.  The process to get our food took very long, so be prepared to dedicate a good portion of your time just sitting and waiting if it's a weekend night. I ordered the Veggie Roll as a starter. As one of the only appealing vegetarian sushi options on the menu, I decided to give it a try. Overall, it tasted pretty much like any vegetable roll I've had in the past. Nothing too special but decent. For my entree, I ordered the Vegetable Delight with tofu. The tofu was not crispy like I would expect, but still very tasty. The vegetables were cooked and seasoned well. The yum yum sauce stole the show, truthfully. My boyfriend started with the Spicy Typhoon roll which was a disappointment. It was mostly rice and deep-fried batter. For his entree, he ordered the Hibachi Shrimp which is on par with any other hibachi shrimp meal. The portion sizes are big enough to take home and make another meal out of it - always a plus. We opted out of dessert after we were told the only option was freezer burnt chocolate ice cream (A for honesty, I guess)  Overall, the prices were average when it came to the quality of the food, however, the entire experience will probably deter me from returning anytime soon.  FYI, you get a free appetizer if you sign up for their mailing list, but they will not accept it unless the coupon is physically printed out.",

Very disappointed, paid $12.00 for dry noodles and a small serving of chicken.   I'm aware that the food is not prepared there and cannot be compared to the quality of their restaurant food, but if I were responsible for this presentation I would be embarrassed. Very poor quality.  This being said, I would not hesitate dining at a Nakama restaurant. I have heard good things from many people, but if you're going to PPG Paints Arena avoid the Nakama lo mein.",

The chicken was diced super tiny and extremely overcooked which gave it a chewy texture and there was an odd chemical taste to everything. It does come with salad and soup so I was still full despite not eating much of the hibachi.",

    "text": "This used to be our go to place until last night. They overcharged us by $30 on our bill. I brought it to our servers attention not once but twice. I received a birthday coupon to use that said it can be used for \"up to $20 on a dinner entree or $12 on a sushi roll\". I ordered a $20.99 chicken entree and a $13.99 sushi roll. My wife ordered a $13.99 sushi roll and we had a few other items on there. They charged $28.99 for the chicken entree and the bill said \"seafood\". My server told me that it was the same price and I corrected her and told her to look at the menu. They also put a $10 plate fee on the bill because I asked to have the large meal placed on two plates in the event that my wife would want to try some of it. She never ate one bite and we put it in a box to take home. When she brought the second check, with the $10 plate fee removed, it still said \"Seafood\" $28.99 and my $20 discount coupon was on there. I again had to tell her that I got chicken and we were being overcharged by $8. She brings the third check back and it was correct but my $20 coupon dropped to $12. I asked why my coupon went down $8? I was told because they removed the $10 plate fee, which was bull crap from the beginning. This entire check saga went on for 20 minutes. We arrived at 6:05 and never left until 7:50. They will never get another dollar from this guy and it's a shame because this used to be the place to go. I wish I could leave a \"no star\" review. If you want better sushi and service go to Social House or Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon.",

Luckily it was just the two of us so we were able to sit at the sushi bar right away and you get the whole menu at the sushi bar which was a good thing since hubby wanted steak hibachi.  The onion soup came with our meal and was nice and spicy. We had the Hamachi, toro, sake, tamago, all nice and tasty and the nice sweet tamago. The caterpillar roll was very good and we also had the spicy yellow tail roll which was ok.  Service was fast, really fast considering how busy they were.  Prices are comparable to all other Japanese steakhouses, the steak hibachi was $28.00, the rolls were 10.99, 6.99, 5.99  They have valet parking ($7) which was nice since we are from out of town and had no idea where to park.  Talking with people there, they are always very busy and have 600 reservations on Saturdays, so if hitting it on a weekend or if you want to sit at the hibachi tables I would make a reservation.  We both said we would come back. Only complaint I have is the sushi bar is near the door and I was cold. If you're at the hibachi tables I'm sure you'd be nice and warm ;)  One question: What is with the cards on the ceiling?",

    "text": "If I could give this place negative stars, I absolutely would. Had a reservation for 10 last Friday. Hung out at the bar area while waiting for all members of our dinner party to arrive. My friend was attempting to order a drink from bartender Susan (dark, curly hair) and was met with a rude \"you're gonna have to wait\" response from her. (Keep in mind that the bar was not overly busy at this point in time) My friend was talking among the group about the extremely poor service he had just received. Susan overheard and began to scream at my friend in front of the whole bar. I would say it was the most unprofessional thing I had ever witnessed by a customer service employee, but the manager Sun took the cake on that. Susan called Sun over and complained about my friend. Without hesitation, Sun removed my friend's drink from his hand and asked him to leave. At no point did Sun attempt to hear my friend's point of view. Needless to say, we took our business elsewhere. I approached Sun and calmly asked why my friend was kicked out. Her response was \"he started yelling first\" which could not have been further from the truth. I told her we would be cancelling our reservation for the evening, to which she responded \"bye\". This was my first and last Nakama experience. I will NEVER step foot in that place again. I'll eat gas station sushi before I give them my money. If you're thinking about dining here, do yourself a favor and cancel while you still can. Or at the very least, make sure Sun and Susan aren't working.",

I am surprised on all the negative and mixed reviews on here.  I have eaten a lot of sushi, in a lot of restaurants, in a lot of cities and Nakama's is legit.    The prices are very fair especially for the portions and how fresh it is...the nigiri slices and sashimi pieces are generous and so are all the rolls....nigiri (2 pieces) or sashimi (3 pieces) of white tuna, ahi tuna, yellow tail, eel for 5.99, salmon 4.99.....inside out rolls (8 pieces) 5.99-6.99...maki rolls (6 pieces) for 3.99-4.99....rainbow roll and specialty rolls around 11.99....this is hardly pricey considering how much you get, how fresh it is and where you're eating it at....I don't see how people had bad times here...did I just get lucky and show up on their good nights everytime?  The sushi is well presented and the service has always been good.  The location is perfect in the heart of the south side.  It's a sexy, busy atmosphere and can get loud, but it's not a big deal, sit by the window for great people watching up and down Carson St.  If you sit at the bar, you'll find it comfy and easy to eat even though it is a small place....this isn't the biggest restaurant but it's set up nicely no matter where you sit....The drinks are good too!  It's a great spot to take a date or with friends....It's the place to be feel and has a good, energetic vibe.  It's a fun, good-looking, classy crowd and I have to give it 5 stars.  Everytime I go to Nakama it's been a great sushi and dining experience all around....",

This place gets super crowded, so come early (or really late) and try making a reservation (although they will still probably make you wait). We had to wait a long time before they took our order and a lot more time after that before they started cooking our stuff before us, but once that starts, it all really becomes worth it. I am vegetarian so had miso soup, stir-fried mushrooms, vegetables and tofu with sticky rice (and sake!!).. it was all delicious... watching your food get made in front of you makes it soo much tastier. Portions are enormous, so don't overorder. Great place to catch up with friends and have a lot of fun.",

My sushi didn't smell and it didn't have a fishy taste; it just had very little taste altogether.    Nothing was spicy -- piquant -- that was supposed to be spicy.

The tofu in the miso soup was hard..we didn't even eat it. I thought this place was awful. Awful! On a side note, the salmon was $6 for 2 pieces of sushi. Really? Did the person running this restaurant think that there was a salmon shortage, that it was a rare species? Who do they think they are charging that much? Is it salmon laced with koala?

I'm not going to diss Nakama, because I actually really like Nakama. I've gone here on many different occasions: for family and friend gatherings, work-related lunches, or just for drinks. This was where I first learned how to properly use chopsticks. It definitely gets a lot of hype, and sometimes you can't even get a seat, but that's because the hibachi is so damn good. They have this creamy sauce that is out of this world, I know several people who order extra just to take home. The whole experience is nice, really. The sushi is better than average and the hibachi is great, too, but I usually go with anything \"surf n' surf\" (all seafood). The scallops are some of the best around, but a bit on the small side, if I remember correctly. Very good with the cream sauce I mentioned. Don't know what it is, but there's a reason why they keep it a secret. The service is a number one priority, at least from my experiences.  Don't go for the hibachi if you're not in the mood to sit with other people, unless you have a large group. I took my folks once, and I don't think they were totally into it, but it's nice for younger people or a party.",

My husband and I had a gift card and ate there saturday and we decided to sit at a small table in the bar area. Our spicy chicken appetizer was good  but nothing spectacular. Our meals were ok. Fried rice seemed bulk and not freshly made.  Their shrimp sauce was also not great.  Our drinks were really good and the service was really good. There are many other hibachi places I would choose over Nakama.",

Our server was nice but he kept trying to clear the table when we were still eating from plates.  I set my Chop sticks down to get a drink and he took my salad.   The chef was the worst part.   He cooked well but didn't have much flair.  I got rice in my eye and a piece of steak hit me when he was trying to toss it to my husband's plate.   The steak hit the table 3 times then hit me.   He didn't have all of the tables' meals on his cart and had to go back for part of an order after the whole meal was cooked and the person said don't I get scallops?   For what we paid we could have gone else where and had the same if not better hibachi.  I don't think any of us will be back.",

Special occasion= a fire show...indeed! They have sushi and the quintessential hibachi grill chefs performing wild antics as they prepare your dinner. These guys know what they're doing and they are some of the best around. Shrimp slinging into my mouth...GOAL!  The specialty cocktails are ginormous with all the fixings, pineapple, cherries, and Hawaiian umbrellas galore. Nakama Panda anyone?  I get drunk just looking at them, yes they are too sweet and I feel like I have been transported to the magical world of the smurfs as I sip the comical bright blue drink!   Picture a night out with your friends, eight to ten of you surrounding a steel table with a wooden ledge to perch at as you are served a Nakama salad with ginger dressing and greens. The dressings are always so tart. Next a small bowl of Nakama onion soup with mushrooms. I like the Hibachi shrimp fried rice with the sauces to dip my \"shkrimps.\"  The food is common for this type of place so nothing exceptional. Entrees start at around $20. At least one person in the party has to get hibachi or no fireworks! As the meal is cooking blasts of fire warm your face as you munch and drink up the starters. At some point food will be thrown at your face!   Finally the Piece de resistance, happy birthday singers with your Birthday sunday complete with sprinklers and fan fare. (Note that you have to purchase this in advance or you just get a boring scoop of ice cream) enter giant gong...\"GONG!!\"  You're done! Out to the southside street you go to get LOUD and continue the party!",

    "text": "A Saturday night out in Pittsburgh should start at Nakama for no reason other than entertainment (and good cocktails).  The place was packed, but we found a space by the bar in the corner.  We didn't get a chance to eat the food, but I can say the place looks kind of fun.  Not really date worthy as it was pretty loud, but the hibachi style dining is definitely a conversation starter.  I ordered a strawberry citrus-tini, a serious $10 cocktail.  In Philly, I wouldn't think twice about this price, but for the burgh, it seemed a bit steep.  It was quite tasty though and I couldn't really stop myself from licking the flavored sugar on the rim.    Nakama is like the serengeti...it is hunt or be hunted.  Ladies brought their A game, or should I say DD game as most everyone in the place had their breasts on display.  We joked about a possible nipple slip...quite frankly, I wouldn't have been surprised.  The gents are just as preened as the ladies and I couldn't help but see that the Jersey Shore had made it all the way across PA.  Fist pumping anyone?  We only stayed for the one cocktail, but we were there long enough for some decent people watching.  I would suggest going for the beginning of your evening on Carson St.  I know I certainly learned a lot about the singles scene in my short time there.",

But I feel like I'm kind of burned out on hibachi since you're basically paying out the ass for \"the experience.\" I have been to a couple birthday parties here and had a good time, though.  As far as the sushi bar goes, this is one of the better sushi places in Pittsburgh. The fish is pretty fresh. But I feel like it's way overpriced if you just want to come here for sushi rather than hibachi. Nakama is in no way trying to be authentic--they have a large list of special rolls and most of them contain cream cheese or crabstick (two things I dislike, which limits my options here). My favorite thing I've had here is the salmon sashimi with avocado, cucumber, wasabi tobiko, and ponzu sauce, which I tried on a recent lunch visit.  Unfortunately, once night falls the atmosphere straight-up sucks. This is the hot spot for guidos to pregame before they head to Diesel or wherever else those people hang out. The drinks are what you would expect--boring, but fruity and easy to drink. Like I said, you can have an amazing time here if you bring your whole crew and are looking to get tipsy. But if you're not in the mood for a trashy night out, stay far away!",

Soup was really spicy.  Our sushi came out on someone else's plate, they picked at it around their order and sent it back, the sushi chef just re-plated it and gave it to us (gross).  Food was average at best, cook was good though, portions were big.  Server came back once during dinner.  Messed the whole tables checks up and we waited 30 some minutes just to leave after we boxed our food, so we left cash and walked out, paying for our overcharges. Manager no where to be found.  I would avoid this place after this experience.  We used to frequent this place years ago!  What a shame it went so down hill!",

I have tried at least 10 different rolls on their menu through out the times that I have been there.  The sushi is poorly rolled and falls apart. The fish and ingredients that they use are not fresh. The service is OK.  The hibachi is also overpriced as well. The chefs are similar to what you will get any hibachi place.  Also, if you sit in the bar area be prepared to deal with a bunch of yinzer wanna be NYC trendies listening to techno bumping into you while you are trying to eat your food.   The only reason this place stays in business is due to the trendy bar scene and the lack of sushi places in the Pittsburgh area.  However, I think if a restaurant/bar similar to nobu, sushi samba, or RA sushi opened up in Pittsburgh it would blow this place out of the water.",

    "text": "So a group of us decided to go to Nakama for dinner and my birthday. I don't know about them but my experience was not that impressive. I'm probably going to go ahead and split this up into sections.  Hostess: Before we arrived we had called to see if they had availability for 6 guests. Luckily for us they did. When we arrived we ultimately ended up sitting at the bar and I went back to let the hostess know that we didn't need the table anymore. Most hostesses I know would be more than happy to move onto the next guests waiting for a table but this hostess made sure we were ok and double checked if we really wanted to give up our table. I appreciated the gesture.  Cocktail Server: Since we decided to eat in the bar we grabbed a high top table along the window. Unfortunately this table only fit 2 guests at a time while one guests stood. We decided to make due whilst we waited for 6 seats to open up at the bar. The cocktail server made her way over to the table and we ordered soups and salads and a few plates of sushi. Service wasn't too bad with her and I can honestly say she did a great job considering how busy she was.  Bartender (Asian Guy) Before we ordered food from our server we tried to get the attention of the bartender. His attitude was pretty shitty for the most part. He honestly acted like he didn't really give a shit. And for me I take notice of everything  Since happy hour had not ended we wanted to take advantage of the $5 martinis. I ordered a Mango Tango which tasted more like fruit punch and vodka. I was a less than impressed plus he charged me the full price of 9 or 10 bucks. Learn your happy hour deals dude!   After the \"martini\" we decided to order a bottle of champagne from d check this I'm pretty sure we were the only ones in the entire establishment to order champagne.and honly had 1 champagne flute for a group of 6. One champagne flute and 5 water glasses. Are you for real? This is the epitome of ghetto. Working in the industry if you need 6 flutes you better pull 6 flutes out of your ass.   Bartender (Mark) made nakama worth going back to for his company and that's it",

Negatives: I paid $25 per person for overcooked, chewy steak and tasteless shrimp. I decided to fill up on Sapporo, salad, rice and veggies and find the first homeless person to give my leftovers to.

    "text": "Nakama is an anomaly. In the heart of Pittsburgh's South Side you will find one of the best sushi restaurants in the US. The place is big, noisy, and a pick up scene at the bar in the evenings, but the fresh sushi and rolls are simply out of this world.   After several visits I was still baffled by how a Japanese restaurant in Pittsburgh could produce the best damn sushi and rolls I'd ever had. I spoke to the Sushi Chef and he explained everything is flown in fresh daily. Then we had colleagues from San Francisco come to town and they were blown away by Nakama's. Finally we had Japanese customers in town for a week so we awkwardly asked them out to eat \"sushi in Pittsburgh!\". After the meal they said it was the best they had experienced in the US.   I can't wait to get back there soon later this year. Sometimes the ideal visit is a Sunday afternoon sitting at the bar to catch a game and enjoy the great food with a Sapporo. Either way, make this a pit stop when you are in town - you'll be blown away.",

We were the first ones through the door. We have only been to the South Side Location.  The restaurant was clean and ready for the day. The staff was friendly and accommodating to our special occasion. It was a Birthday celebration.   I really enjoyed the Hibachi and Loved the sushi. I always order chicken or salmon Hibachi and I try to always get a Philadelphia Inside out roll.  Everything was fresh and prepared to our liking. Hibachi is always great, because you can see what is being made right in front of you.  I am looking forward to finding the food truck!     We received a free appetizer that day, go on the website and give them a little information and they will send you a email for a free appetizer.  Highly recommend for Hibachi Lovers like myself.",

We waited for the order to be corrected. I ordered eel & sea urchin sushi. The eel was served cold and the sea urchin was old and slimy. We sat at a table near the bar & had a view of what appeared to be someone's closet. We saw coats on the floor and a tennis shoe protruding out into the restaurant. In addition, there was an industrial bucket sitting on the bar chair with lemons and limes and no cover. My first experience there was amazing. This experience of a dirty restaurant with poor quality sushi has left me with a bad taste in my mouth!",

    "text": "I've been such a fan of Nakama but lately things have gone down hill. I make a trip to this location once a month/every other month, and have for years. I've noticed some changes for at least the past year. Portion sizes decreasing, prices increasing, and service hitting rock bottom--quality of food is about the only constant.  The food and location are awesome. Food tastes fresh and well made. Being located on East Carson is awesome, easy to get to with valet parking and street parking available.  Now where it drops off; prices of food have steadily inclined whereas portions are decreasing. Once you'd expect to leave with left overs, now you're lucky with 8 pieces of shrimp in your dinner. Also, the cost of something as minor as having fried rice over steamed rice is nearly $4. But it is worth it considering the past two outings the steamed rice wasn't delivered to the table until after the meal was prepared.   Lastly, the service really needs an overhaul. As someone who has experience in the service industry I know how it is and sometimes you're having an off/bad day but MAN IS IT BAD. From the hostess to our waiter (with exception of the chef--they're typically wonderful!) it feels like everyone is in a rush and no one cares to help you even when placing a food order.   Two of my most recent trips resulting in forgetting to fill out drink/bar order. I can understand waiting on the bartender but water shouldn't take more than 10 minutes. Both of these outings were on Monday nights when the restaurant is at its slowest.   One waitress over charged us on fried rice, no big deal, but then argued that the three of us in our party ordered it while only one did. It took too long to resolve we almost wished we didn't speak up.  Last night our service was even worse, again waiting for the server to arrive, 10 minutes for water, forgetting one water and ignoring the table until our dinner was being cooked. Then it was each time we'd ask for something he would run away. No water refill, no soy sauce, going to the bar to get a container. I can understand on a Friday night but a slow Monday?   I hope this place improves because I really do enjoy it but for the price I'd prefer to spend my money elsewhere",

We ate at the hibachi table and even though there were 8 seats at the table, the hostess sat my hubby and I right up next to the only other couple at the table.  I assumed she was planning on filling up the whole table but once that didn't happen, I felt rude to move.  No big deal really.  They brought out water, soup, and salad and I heard the guy at our table say there was a hair sticking out of his water glass.  The cooktop had plenty of small pieces of food from the people before us but I figured the chef would clean it better before he cooked.  Well, he did wipe the very center but the old food remained.  I really tried to not watch after that.  The food was average.  We didn't have chopsticks at our table which was disappointing.  I'm sure they had them somewhere and I didn't ask so that's my own fault.  I just expect them to be on the table at Japanese restaurants.  Lunch prices were good.  Ill probably stick to my favorites though...Pho Van in the Strip and Mekong in Dormont.",

After eating a very mediocre dinner (saga is much better and a more reasonable price) we received our check. No ice cream and no recognition of my son's birthday. The chef even asked us if we had any birthdays and we told him yes! My husband chases after the waitress explaining that it was my sons birthday (4th time they were told). She arrives with the gong and no ice cream. Seriously don't even make an effort to celebrate a birthday if we have to beg for it. I will NEVER come back. The bathroom was absolutely disgusting. Soap dispenser ripped off the wall, paper products all over the floor, mildew around faucet and a bathroom attendant standing outside greeting you as you walk in a bathroom that is far worse than a convenience store. This place has had it's run and is done. Absolutely disgusting! And I have never given a review on here before. I can't help but to feel compelled to do so!",

There were only 4 of us at the hibachi table, so the  fun factor was pretty dulled down, but it didn't help that you couldn't really hear what the guy was trying to say anyway.

So as for the food: Salad - was well saturated with ginger dressing -I mean they must have tossed it with a good amount of dressing before bringing it out.  The dressing was good, but definitely not that good.  Soup - salted and fine, nothing notable. Shrimp flambe - chewy, tasteless, didn't even have the butter flavor. Rice - steamed and fine Chicken and veggies - dry dry dry chicken, veggies were good, and the flavors on the veggies were very good.   Sauces - okay The ladies room: Pretty clean, and also staffed.  Bottom line for me - I wouldn't come back here on my own volition - there are other places in Pgh I would try first.",

The rolls are actually very fresh, and very delicious. I eat a lot of sushi and I would definetly say this is fresh fish. I would also add that the rolls are very creative... i have never had a roll that I am not satisfied with.  There is also a great atmosphere as usually it is loud, lots of people, TV's everywhere for watching the game. They also have pretty good service!   I definetly love coming to this place, if only it didn't take so long to find a seat!",

The Baked Alaska Roll was topped with salmon that had a smoky taste, which gave the roll an extra kick. I've came back twice to get the same roll, but it no longer had the smoky taste...perhaps it was by accident that the first time tasted so perfect!  I've also had the Boston Roll, Hanalei Roll, Pittsburgh Penguin Roll, and probably a couple more.. don't remember. They consistently have a good balance of ingredients and sauce.   Presentation was great. Last time, I had my rolls spread out on the plate in the shape of a giant flower hehe  Service was always fine, never have to wait too long for the dishes. I always come here if I'm in the area.. even if I've already had dinner, just to get a sushi roll to-go!",

However, I ordered hibachi meals, 3 of them.  I also ordered sushi as well.  I received no sauce with my order.  No soy sauce, shrimp sauce or steak sauce.  I called the restaurant, because this is their mistake and spoke with a manager named Sum or Sam, I couldn't make out her name due to the noise in the background.  I explained the issue and she told me to come and pick it up.  No apology or otherwise for the mistake.  I explained that I ordered delivery because I didn't have a means to pick it up at this time, and she said oh well.  At that point she said, well I'm not going to keep discussing the same thing and hung up on me.  I called back in and am currently waiting for an owner to contact me.  A simple I'm sorry goes a long way, further more don't offer delivery through a third party if you can't provide the items that are supposed to come with an order.  I won't be going to this establishment or ordering from them again.",

In particular, one of my friends and I were wearing almost identical outfits (sheer dresses over out bathing suits) except that she even had shorts on under her dress.  She is black and I am white.  The manager on duty approached her and asked her to leave because she was not \"obeying the dress code\" but he didn't say anything to me, in an arguably more revealing outfit.  When she asked him for clarification, he asked did she want to speak to the owner and she said yes, to which he replied, \"well he's not here.\"  I can completely understand upholding a dress code, but I cannot comprehend selective dress codes.  If her outfit was unacceptable, then so was mine and we should have both been asked to leave but he ONLY said something to her!  He then proceeded to call the police and told them that my friend was \"causing a scene\" (she wasn't.)  I will never set foot in this racist establishment again!",

Whenever I have a craving and don't want to get all dressed up for the night, Nakama is my go to.   Service is alright here, rarely is it quick, so make sure you have some time to spend. It is definitely pricey, for 4 rolls and 2 beers it was close to $80.",

    "text": "I went here with my friends to celebrate joint birthdays and we all decided in checking out this place, because who doesn't love hibachi? Right?!  Anyway we had made reservations for about 15 people and were seated at a hibachi table. Everybody made their drink orders and were given our drinks in a reasonable amount of time.   Hubby and I went for the hibachi, while the majority of our party opted for sushi. Anyway, one of the things that I expect from a hibachi joint is a cheesy, interactive chef and this guy was none of those things. He just basically cooked his dishes and did one onion volcano and that's about it. No crowd interaction or goofy jokes..... this is something I always expect.  Also there were no acknowledgement of anyone's birthday despite telling the waitress.  People that ordered got their fried rice, but I ended up ordering steamed rice, which never arrived when my scallops and steak and veggies had arrived. I was starving at this point so I just proceeded eating and noticed that the waitress did not come back to the table, even to refill drinks. I actually had to flag her down to inquire about my rice. My husband has finished his beer and actually wanted another one but was nowhere to be found. The service was pretty disappointing overall. Another thing that I found disappointing was the small portion size for hibachi. Usually I am used to walking out with left overs for two days from one order of hibachi. The sides were just a small portion of rice, vegetables, and soup and salad, but no lo mein or other hibachi standards.  Not even a small scoop of ice cream at the end.  So needless to say I was kinda bummed out about this too.   In terms of the food I will have to say that my scallops were perfectly cooked, and my steak was pretty awesome, but overall I found the customer service here pretty lacking.  At one point my husband was walking to the bathroom and was nearly run over by a member of the wait staff and didn't even receive an \"excuse me\".  The lack of service kind of overshadows everything else.   I also think that their decor was pretty cool and really liked their vibe, but overall my experience was just meh.",

    "text": "Nakama: Overall, I give three stars due to okay food and varying levels of service.  Service: I came here for my friend's birthday. We had a pretty large party and made reservations ahead of time. When we got there, we ended up still waiting for another thirty minutes or so, which was fine with us. What got us a little annoyed was how the hostess was not kind to us or anyone else that was there at the time. When we were getting seated, they were unsure where to seat us and we had to walk around the restaurant once before settling.  Our waitress was one of the sweetest people ever. Her name was Stephanie and I want to say how much I appreciated having her as our waitress. The whole restaurant is loud and super crowded, and she remained calm and helpful throughout the entire night. I would often see her running from place to place.  The manager was also very sweet. My girlfriend made an ice cream cake for our friend and he was the one who brought it out for us, helped us cut it, and even washed the cake pan afterwards. He is obviously very proactive in customer satisfaction. In addition, the restaurant didn't charge us extra for all of this, which many restaurants do.  Food: Food was only okay for me. I got the chicken diabolo and my girlfriend got the steak. The chicken was not fresh, extremely dry, and chewy. The steak was not the greatest either, it seemed to have the same problems of being a little dry and chewy, not as bad as my chicken was though. I was definitely very full after all of this though, it was a lot of food. If I ever come back, most likely, I will get the shrimp, since that was pretty good.  This was my first Hibachi restaurant experience. While I understand the excitement of the show, etc., I don't think it's worth it for the quality of the food.",

Rainbow roll was really good, except one of the pieces of fish tasted a bit slimy to me, so that was a little unsettling. Rest of the roll was great, however. The Boston roll though was very underwhelming. It was supposed to have cream cheese in it, but for the life of us, we could not taste the cream cheese! How are you going to advertise cream cheese as one of your key ingredients when there's basically no cream cheese except for maybe in one measly piece? Quite disappointing.  Service was good. Our waitress was nice, quick, and efficient. Just how servers should be. A little on pricier side though, so watch for that.  Bottom line: sushi-wise, this place is okay. I won't be craving it, but if someone were to invite me out to dinner there, I wouldn't put up a fuss. It's not a place I would go out of my way to eat at.",

The habachi just isn't the same.  What happened? Did I change? Did this place change? I think it's a little of both. Maybe I can compare it to a relationship. Yes, that's it. Things were awesome at first. We were in love and everything was just perfect. The sushi was fantastic and fresh. The habachi was so delicious I wanted to lick my plate.  Then over time things started to deteriorate. The sushi didn't taste like my beloved Penn Ave Fish, my new amore. The habachi was missing something. Did the soup recipe change? Not as much flavor. Did the portions get smaller. Where did my sprouts go?! Things started to head south...  The last straw was the whole atmosphere or Club Nakama we'll call it. The music is pulsating techno. The crowd is judge-y. The service is lacking. And the food, it's nothing special. Sad, because what once was, is no more:(  It's time to break-up. We had a good run. We may run into each other once in a while and be friendly, but for now, it's time we take a break. Might be for good this time. You never know....",

I recently went on a Friday night with a group of 6 and sat at a hibachi table. The waiter was nice and the service was decent. It wasn't fast but also not extremely slow. For an appetizer, we got sushi. My boyfriend liked his nigiri. I on the other hand was not too satisfied with my philly roll. It was just okay. The avocado was hard...not the freshest sushi I've had. As for my meal I ordered the hibachi shrimp. I forgot how huge the portions were! Seriously so much food...soup, salad, rice, veggies and shrimp. It was all good but didn't blow me away. The hibachi chef wasn't impressive and didn't really put on a show. Nakama is a south side staple and has been around for years but honestly the hype has died down for me. I was surprised by how busy it was so I guess people still enjoy it.",

Maybe it's been a few years since I've been to Nakama, but instead of being a sushi/hibachi hot spot it feels more like a bar in south side that just happens to have sushi.  The staff seemed disinterested and chided us for making a reservation. Apparently we only needed one if we were ordering hibachi (we weren't).  The sushi fit our craving, but it was just mediocre. The seaweed salad was unusually sweet and the sushi was at least room temperature. I usually enjoy sushi that is a little on the colder side.  All in all, I'm glad we went to check it out since my romanticized last visit, but am ready to move on!",

I had coconut shrimp, which was delicious, as well as a Hawaiian roll--which I wasn't the biggest fan of. But overall the whole experience was good. I'd recommend!",

However, on this night I must honestly say I felt like I was back in the slave days. On Saturday February 9th I visited Nakama with a young lady. We walked into the restaurant and sat at a pair of seats close to the entrance. After about 10 minutes I asked the hostess was there a server working in our area. The hostess who was great by the way, said he will be around soon. Another 10 minutes passed and no menu, no water, and no greeting. I asked the server could we at least get a menu and she kindly obliged a d also gave us our water. The hostess then said that's your server right there. I asked him could I speak to him and he blatantly said NO! I tried to speak to him and second time and the server walked away. During this time a white couple walks in and the server immediately greets them with menus and goes to get there water. Immediately a white male sits beside us and again the server goes and retrieves a menu and water. I asked to speak to the manager but was directed to the owner. I voice my concerns to the owner and he shakes his head and says I'll give you free drinks. I didnt come to Nakama for drinks!!!! The owner directed another male server to wait on my friend and I. Since when does a server have the option not to wait on two guests? The server that took over was GREAT!! However, my night was ruined and no one seemed to care. During this entire fiasco the initial server that did not speak to us kept right on visiting the people beside us. I could here him say if you need anything I'm your guy. I was pissed off but felt helpless at the time. Finally the manager comes over and offers a discount.  I have to say this restaurant will never see another dollar if mine. Basically this server had an issue with the color of my skin.  I have to ask is this the type of behavior Nakama allows???",

I went to Nakama for the first time this past Friday in 2-3 years. This place has sadly declined. It is definitely not as good as it used to be & the hibachi just isn't the same. Had the management changed over the past few years? A group of 6 of us went for Hibachi before a night out. The service was good, but a little slow. The hibachi chief was not very impressive & my tuna steak was flavorless. Additionally, the vegetables served with our hibachi were still hard when they placed on our plates. The portions were huge, but nothing great. I will say the cherry blossom roll that we had as an appetizer was really good, but pricy. I am surprised Nakama is always busy still. I'm sure I'll be back, but probably not for a while.",

The rice was mushy and blocked all together when there should be some separation and it should be gently packed. It was just really bad rice. The fish was cut horribly and tasted really fishy, which is not how sushi should be. In fact, I couldn't even eat some of the fish because it tasted so bad. I understand Pittsburgh is landlocked but this is truly something else. The skill and care involved in making this sushi was absent. This ruined my day. My stomach hurts. This was disgusting and I'd highly advise to never come here.  Update: I had to run to the bathroom to throw up, my stomach still hurts and I still have that awful fishy taste in my mouth. This has been traumatic.",

It's rarely crowded at lunch and the portions are generous so I always have leftovers. At hibachi lunch, you get your entree, soup or salad (go with a friend, each get one, and share!), mushroom or shrimp appetizer, and fried rice. It's a great deal and always ask for more of the shrimp sauce. The chefs are fun, service is good, sushi is great. My favorite entrees are the chicken, strip steak, and scallops. All are tasty options.   Dinner is much pricier plus you have to pay extra for the fried rice and you get a lot of extra sides like the soup and salad and a vegetable medley. Personally, I think lunch prices are a better deal.",

But we still decide to give it a try just because of it is located in the heart of southside and it would against logic that it serves the worst sushi. It was a Sunday night and we were able to grab a seat very quickly. We ordered seaweed salad, tuna poke, Unami sashimi, rainbow roll and Hawaii style roll. I have to say I am glad we gave this place a chance. The seaweed salad could be better but it certainly didn't taste bad tho. Just compare to everything else it was just average. But of course Everything else tasted great! The reason I am giving it a four star not five are service and sanitary.   Service, the waitress refilled my water once and then just didn't think I might need another refill. Drank the last drop of my water, not happy with this. Sanitary, saw a huge fly on the window(thank god not on our table or even food). I'm guessing it might just got in since the door was open and we sat at the high table area which is kind close to the door.  So over all, some miner change will put this place to a five star sushi place.",

The servers and bartenders are very friendly adding to the overall experience.   Valet parking is offered on the weekends.  Finding a spot to park along the street during the week on the evenings is fairly easy.   Dine solo or with friends and Nakama has all the makings for a good time.",

We also ordered a bowl of chicken fried rice that my husband claimed was the best he had ever had ( I think they cooked it with a LOT of butter). We watched the sushi chefs prepare way more interesting looking dishes while we waited for our food and enjoyed the atmosphere. Our waitress, Lauren, was a giant bag. That is my only complaint.  Not sure if we were just really luck to get the 3 seats as we walked in or what??  There was a constant line up in the waiting area so maybe we were lucky.",

The place looked nice relative to a lot of neighboring establishments and was recommended by our lunch-time server @ Nola (very good Creole) and our concierge.  My low rating comes from the fact that I called twice to make a reservation and no one answered.  After taking a cab from downtown we learned there was a private party and we wouldn't be able to take in the Jersey Shore fist pumping scene (thanks Callan W for the visual).  Simply disappointed in the lack of basic customer service.  We ended up down the street at the Pittsburgh Steak Company.  Not sushi but the gorgonzola filet melts in your mouth!!",

It still kills me that Nakama and Max & Ermas have the same entertainment.   Service was a bit spotty. The place was packed but we still stay at the bar for 20 minutes sans cocktails.

I wouldn't have had a problem with this but the place was not that crowded and my party of 4 ended up spending a lot of money on sushi and drinks so its difficult for me to understand how they wouldn't accommodate us at a table.  Additionally, they forgot my appetizer and made no effort to apologize at the end of the night.  Great atmosphere, food and location. Improve your service.",

Unless you are offering to spend at least double the amount worthy of the actual value of food and service, I would highly discourage anyone from visiting this establishment.  If you are looking for a classy, Japanese restaurant with a bar, I would go to UMI - SOBA on Ellesworth St. in Shadyside.",

I asked they could cook it without butter and with double vegetables, no rice.  (a simple request that most Hibachi restaurants are OK with). A few minutes after I ordered, the manager came out to ask me if I was allergic to butter- I said no just watching what I eat. He told me that if they busier, they would not be able to make my requested meal but if they were busy, they would not be able to make it. He wanted to make sure I knew in case I wanted to order again. While he was very nice about it, I found it troublesome that a restaurant that cooks everything fresh will not customize a meal while busy. Not a huge deal overall, but still would not come here if you are trying to be health-cautious.",

Other than the fact that they have some marketing and advertising genius who's greased the palms of every \"guide to the city\" and \"best restaurants\" free pamphlet that they hand out at hotel concierge desks, I don't know what all the hype's about.   They have a big sushi bar area, and quite a few grills in the back. We sat at a table with some PITT football players and I ordered the filet, while TY got surf and turf. It was all kind of eh, but I have to say that customer service was very good and all the staff were really nice. The filet was tender, but I think just the flavor of everything was mediocre, especially at their prices. We had a coupon for $15 in one of the aforementioned guide books, so pick one of those up before you spend your money here.",

    "text": "I recently went to Nakama for the first time for a first date - many firsts that night. Starting with the bad: We made dinner reservation for 7:15 and were a few minutes late. We were told that we lost our spot and had the choices to either wait a half hour to 45 minutes, sit at the sushi bar, or just order food at a table without the hibachi experience. We opted to get a drink at the bar  and wait it out. This was a Wednesday evening and the place was packed. No seats available at first so we checked out the drink menu and finally we got a couple of chairs.   The drinks were decent - I'm a lightweight so they were good for me. It worked out that we waited for the hibachi because we were able to be squeezed in within ten minutes.    I got Hibachi Seasame Chicken and my date got Nakama Tuna Steak. He also ordered sushi but our waiter had forgotten to bring it- It was really no problem because the portion sizes are pretty big and we probably couldn't have ate the sushi anyways.   I have no complaints about my chicken - It definitely exceeded my expectations based on the other reviews I have seen for it. My date goes there on the regular and so his Tuna Steak obviously has his coming back for more. The Onion Soup was by far one of the better Japanese soups I have had. It has a kick to it that I haven't tasted anywhere else.   Our hibachi chef was wonderful. He was entertaining, easy to talk to and was really good at his job. He even let us all try a little fried rice.   I always have had reservations about Nakama because I thought it was an overexposed restaurant that jacked its prices up because of its trendy reputation. I really enjoyed my time there. It was clean and had a lot of energy. I'll be back again.",

Certainly not worth $50. They also serve this nasty \"shrimp sauce\" which is basically thousand island dressing. I was worried about the food safety on the hibachi \"chef's\" cart.

She was considerate and asked us if we wanted separate checks which I always forget to ask upfront. My friend got the nakama Cosmo which she thought had too much sour mix. I had the French kiss, it was great. Sweet and sour but not overly sweet. We then split three sushi rolls and seaweed salad. Love seaweed salad. Sweet and vinegary with a good crunch. We got the basic salmon roll, Hawaiian roll and haiku roll. They were so delicious and very fresh. Came quickly too on a very busy Saturday night. Great place to get hibachi with a group of friends or intimate for a date! Not the cheapest option for good sushi is south side but the atmosphere makes it very worthwhile!",

Self seating around the bar so we didn't have to wait at all at 9pm on a Saturday night. Rolls are big and are a decent price and the fish is super fresh. Two of the rolls tasted exactly the same which was a little disappointing: the Hawaii roll and the Haiku roll. If you want more variety don't order them together. Overall, Would recommend!!",

Inari is one of my favorites, and when I ordered it here, all I got was 4 fried tofu skin sheets and a couple slices of cucumber. That is not inari sushi! I don't know what it was! Also, the bartenders have no idea how to make simple drinks. Don't bother ordering one unless you want it to be wrong, four times what it should cost, and 25 minutes after you order it.",

My boyfriend and I  went there for dinner & were delighted  by the menu selection the ambiance at first but once our meal came, it was absolutely mind blowing. The sushi was so fresh, so delectible, so DELISH and I think this will be my new \"go-to\" spot in Pittsburgh for amazing sushi. There are so many more rolls that I would like to try. I cannot wait to return to Pittsburgh to go to Nakama again! :)",

We were seated immediately at one of the tables. There was a group of 5 already seated at the table we were seated at with their drinks already in hand and ready to order. We felt a bit rushed because they were ready to order and we just sat down. My girlfriend ordered the Spicy California Roll as an app. She said it was \"ok\".... Nothing special. ... But in their defense she also said it's a pretty plain roll. I got the Bobs Triple Combination with steak, shrimp, and chicken, while she got the Hibachi Shrimp. After she was eating the roll, the server came over and said \"so, is the roll repulsive?!\". To which my girlfriend responded \"yeah, it's disgusting\". It was just completely awkward. He didn't know if she was serious.. I did, and gave him the ok nod. It was just weird. I had some captain and cokes, she had a few Rieslings... The cook was great, the food was tasty as always. I do think he put a but too much salt in it, but it was still great. Our tab after tip was $121.00   All in all, an ok experience. If it wasn't for the awkward comment from the waiter, it would have been a 4 star.. I do love me Hibachi and it's the closest place to me, so I am sure I will be back. I do prefer Sapporo out on 60 because it is a family run business and you are always treated greatly...",

    "text": "Let me start with what works at Nakama: The servers. They're super nice and efficient.  What doesn't work is the food, the prices, the crowds, the incredibly busy, loud bar without the possibility of being seated in the quieter room (reserved only for Habachi eaters) -- even when you're paying $15.00/person FOR LUNCH!  And, the restaurant demands that you dress in nice casual wear. No t-shirts, yet the food was terrible!  We shared the Spider Roll and the Chicken and Shrimp Habachi plate, as well as a seaweed salad. The salad was okay. The Spider Roll came in a sticky, overly-sweet sauce which ruined the flavor. The crab was rubbery and seemed old. The chicken Habachi was waaaaaaay overcooked (dry to the point of being hard to swallow),  the shrimp smelled old , and it was NOT DEVEINED (read: it still had the poop tunnel in it!). ICK! This is supposed to be Pittsburgh's finest sushi restaurant? Old fish meets overcooked chicken, meets truly bad sushi, meets loud bar with no option to sit elsewhere (even when you're not drinking), meets overpriced lunch menu!  My advice: Go elsewhere! If you want something to eat, check out ANY other restaurant in the South Side. Even if it's bad, it won't be as expensive as Nakama. But, there are better places to be had in Pittsburgh. Not being from the area, I can't speak for sushi bars, but,  I especially like The Gypsy Cafe and Primanti's in the South Side. Cheers!",

There were definitely people waiting in line because they didn't make reservations. We chose not to get drinks but the people around us ordered drinks and said they loved them. We ordered a spicy California rolls for an appetizer and it actually came out really really fast. It was great. Then we got one chicken hibachi meal and one steak hibachi meal and we loved both. The steak was a tiny bit overcooked but not bad. The soup was a different kind of seasoning than I've had at other hibachi restaurants and so was the salad dressing, but both were good. I would say it is pricey, as are any hibachi places, but we got a significant amount of food for our money. I really loved it (outside of the AWFULLY RUDE guests that sat next to us and were mean to the waitress), but we would go back again. The only thing that turned me off about the restaurant was watching the amount of butter go into the rice and steak! Lol",

Service was really nice and attentive since they weren't super busy. However, the table we sat at had a spilled soy sauce puddle and a soaked menu.

The deal is pretty good -- you pick the protein (or veggies) and you get that, fried rice, salad, and a mini appetizer of (2) shrimp.  In addition to the hibachi scallops, I ordered the Nakama ceviche appetizer. When it arrived I was a bit thrown because, while it was a very pretty plate, it wasn't what I would call ceviche. Instead, it was a few large pieces of tuna sashimi on a bed of raw white onion, carrots, and I believe jicama. There wasn't much citrus flavor at all and the raw white onion was a bit too much. The tuna was delicious, but I would definitely change the name of the item.  The hibachi scallops were cooked perfectly, and the fried rice accompaniment was a little too good (I watched lots of butter go into it). Very yummy.  As far as the hibachi performance went, there wasn't much, though it was 12pm on a Saturday, so I get it. Our chef was very nice and kept up some good conversation with us. I also greatly enjoyed the fireball he started off with (see picture).",

The salad and mushroom soup they start you off with is better than any similar types I've had at other hibachi restaurants.  I love the ginger salad dressing and the great taste of the soup.  It is a great start to a great meal.  My go to meal here is the Hibachi Chateaubrind.  It is filet seared in a garlic butter.  I order mine medium rare and it is always cooked perfectly.  Each bite literally melts in your mouth and the flavor is out of this world.  The shrimp are also a delicious side to the meal.  I also find the rice at Nakama to just taste a little better than other spots.  Always look forward to my next trip back!",

    "text": "Okay, let me preface all of this by saying they'd get 5 stars if they weren't BLASTING 90's hip hop over the speakers. I get it, it's the south side. But on the same hand, it's a restaurant. Slow your roll. (See what i did there?)  I've had nakama bookmarked on Yelp for close to four years. I've always wanted to go, but never really made the time. Got asked on a date here, and couldn't turn it down. I love sushi.  So, this cant speak to the hibachi tables, but maybe someday it can.   Arrived at 8pm on Saturday for our reservation, and immediately were seated at a (wobbly) table by the window. We knew we were there for sushi, and we couldn't wait to get to ordering. They have paper sushi menus you can fill out with a little golf pencil and turn in like homework to make your sushi appear. We just kept checking boxes. Haha! So many amazing choices. Thanks to everyone who recommended the Hanalei Roll, it was amazing!   So the order went a little something like this; Spider Roll, Hanalei Roll, Pittsburgh Penguins Roll (much to the disappointment of my date did not contain penguin. KIDDING), Spicy Crab Salad Roll, and the Crunchy Philly Roll. When Leah, our server, brought them out we (and our little wobbly table) were a little overwhelmed. But we made it disappear quite quickly.   Neither one of us really liked the Penguins Roll. Seemed like it was just..missing something. The spider roll is forever my go to when trying new sushi. It was great. The Hanalei Roll, as previously stated was incredible. Who knew you could flash fry sushi?! The crunchy Philly Roll was about the same. Really good and disappeared quickly. My amazing date really enjoyed the spicy crab salad roll. Leah recommended it, and it was an excellent choice.   Everything was really great. No complaints on service, Leah made sure we had everything we needed quickly, and kept our water glasses full. Let's turn that music down a little bit, remember, this is Nakama, not Jimmy D's.   I will definitely be back. Hopefully WE will definitely be back.   Happy Eating!",

As we waited in the bar area for the rest of my family to arrive, we were able to enjoy some beverages. Can't really rave too much, we only ordered beer and water...but it was cold!  Anyways, we were seated....let the show begin! Ok wait, they took our orders first and came out with our salads. I must say the salads were very tasty....loved the dressing. Yessss!!!! Ok...let the show begin!!!!!! We had so much fun with our cook, with his slicing and dicing skills. He was even giving me food, that I didn't order...he said come on just try it. I said ok....sure! And it was tasty! I did order the chicken, veggie, and rice hibachi....extra sauce please. Oh the sauce is to die for!!!! Ahhhmazing! He did a cute little hat fire trick. I must admit that I was a little nervous for himself and possibly our lives too. But we didn't need to call the fire department. It was my 2 year old nephew first time at a hibachi restaurant and he was very entertained.  Overall the experience was great, as well as the food. I think next time, I want to do a girls night out here. So much fun!",

    "text": "I have heard Nakama referred to as the best sushi in Pittsburgh far too many times. It's not AWFUL, but it's nowhere near the top of the list. Umi, Andy's and Yamato in Monroeville, just to name a few off of the top of my head, all blow them away. The atmosphere is nice. It's your average hibachi restaurant. I would never go there specifically for the sushi. I have been to all of the locations, including the booth at PPG Paints arena, and it's consistent. Actually... the booth at PPG is sort of awful.",

I've never had any of the other food so I can't speak for anything else. I've never had a bad experience but have also never been blown away by anything crazy.  Seating is available at the sushi counter, bar, hibachi table and dining room. It gets very busy and crowded on weekends so I recommend a reservation if you have a larger group.  It can get loud as well especially in the evening on weekends so I wouldn't come here during that time if you want a quiet and intimate environment.  Overall a good choice in my opinion and I will be back at some point.",

Conveniently located on the corner of Carson and 18th, Nakama is a popular destination for those looking for sushi and the famous hibachi-grilled meals.   I opted out of the hibachi specials, but my date ordered the sesame chicken and was quite pleased. Don't be alarmed by the higher than usual prices, the portions can feed 2-3 easily. The sushi was prepared well, although it came out after our meals were already served.   In the past, I've had less than desirable experiences, but this go around, I had no complaint. Great food and good service.",

We ordered the lettuce wraps and the chicken was ground instead of actual chicken. We also ordered shrimp egg rolls and they came greasy and veggie only.  The cherries in our drinks tasted like they were marinated in jet fuel and my Planters Punch was poorly assembled in a rocks glass instead of a hi-ball with no pineapple flavor at all.

The rest of the time it was for a few drinks or some sake because it was a nice day out and I like sitting near their windows. I've never ordered a specialty drink, only beer and sake. Tip: if you go and like sake, get the Crazy Milk and check out the bottle for a few lulz.  We've ordered food twice, I believe, one time being referenced above when it was a full meal and the order was just some sushi for tapas-style appetizers. Neither time has the food impressed me. In fact, it's probably the worst sushi I have ever had. My boyfriend ordered a spicy tuna roll and the tuna looked like baby food, as if someone had chewed it up and spit it back out - no lie. It was disgusting, but he powered through most of it as he was starving. They also managed to mess up fried rice, completely annihilating the veggies for some reason. The sushi rolls I've ordered have ranged from \"eh\" to \"gross.\"  I can't give this place less than 3 stars, though, because every time I've gone I've had a really great time. I guess I would break down my review like this: Food - 1 star, Atmosphere - 4 stars, Service - 4 stars.",

Server seemed very rushed, barely staying at the table for 1 minute to take orders.  Today, I had my 9 year old son with us.  He ordered a steak kids meal, which the menu states is steak, vegetables, rice, and ice cream for dessert.  He got no veggies (which I didn't even mention since he won't eat them anyway) but he ate all of his meal and was excited for ice cream.  The server never mentioned or brought it, so I asked, \"he's supposed to get ice cream with his meal right?\"  He says, \"oh, let me check if we have any.\"  About 10 minutes later he comes back with our check and says, \"sorry we're out of ice cream.\" My son says, \"do you have any other dessert?\" Server says, \"No, but the Milkshake factory is a few doors down.\"  Really?!?!?  Your solution to being out of something is referring me to another establishment down the street?  Is Nakama buying him a milkshake? Otherwise, I don't know, but that just seems ridiculous to me.  He acted as if I was trying to get some freebie or something.  It says it comes with the meal.  At least offer the kid a pineapple or take a drink off the check or something.  No, I did not take it up with the manager because at this point I just wanted to get out of there.",

We come here regularly but today was exceptionally awesome because of our chef's upbeat personality and witty jokes the whole time. Our chef, Luke, was entertaining as well as cooked everything perfectly. Would request his table again in the future. Also ordered a Philly roll, which are always delicious here. The veggie egg roll we got was actually pretty disgusting. It was so oily and tasted bitter. I told the waitress and she gladly removed from my bill. Other than that, lunch was great.",

We usually get the hibachi dinner and it's always delicious and fun to watch!  We usually get some sushi too!  I live in LA now, so I've definitely had some good sushi out here, but I think the sushi at Nakama is just as good.   My biggest complaint about this place is that it's way overpriced.  They charge you for all of these little extra things too, like fried rice, which I feel is pretty unnecessary.  The sushi is also overpriced in my opinion.  Overall though, I've always had a great time at Nakama and I love the food!  I would definitely recommend it!",

Little Tokyo in Mt. Lebanon and Kiku in Station Square are better. Nakama is good for some enjoyable sushi and, more importantly, the atmosphere.  You can go here and watch the pens game AND eat a roll.  Can't say that about a lot of sushi restaurants.  4.5 of 10 relative to sushi quality alone",

    "text": "Disclaimer: This is review is for the SUSHI BAR ONLY   Went here last Saturday and stopped in for a quick bite at the sushi bar, mainly to try it out because I've heard so many good things about Nakama.   To be honest, my experience was exactly like the two star Yelp rating means: Meh. I've experienced better.  Two of the 4 rolls I ordered were loosely made which as a sushi lover I found to be kinda unacceptable. One had an end piece that frankly would have gotten the sushi chef a failing grade by anyone's standards - it was falling apart and had nothing but rice and paper on it despite this being a fairly pricey signature roll. One of my sushi pieces was similarly falling apart - the rice hadn't been packed enough and the salmon was just slapped on there.   I would even have sent those back if I could have found a waitress or been able to hear myself think. They were just too crowded to give the proper amount of love to each dish, and as you know, a dish prepared without love is bound to be lacking.  The noise and my seat in relation to the crowded door area just made me want to get out of there. I was bumped several times by people weaving their way past each other, at one point someone bumped my elbow as I was raising a cup of hot sake. Hmm ... a splash of hot sake? ... let's say it's not my favorite sensation in the crotch area.  Anyway, the staff was friendly when you were able to flag someone down and I am sure everyone was doing their best, but think this place is highly overrated - making it over crowded - making the whole experience that much less enjoyable for everyone.  Hope your experience is better than mine - the place should have been better from what I've been told by Nakama fans. Good luck!!",

    "text": "Large selection of premium sushi and sashimi.  This time around I tried the Philadelphia roll and Spicy Tuna roll. Both are some of the cheaper options on their menu, but you get 8 medium-sized pieces in these rolls, so it's a decent value. The tuna roll wasn't spicy at all. Like, I could taste a little spiciness if I focused, but it definitely wasn't what I expected. Similarly, I couldn't taste the smoked salmon very much in the Philadelphia roll.  The spicy chicken appetizer, however, was appropriately spicy. It's also a cheaper option (being an appetizer) and it's half off for happy hour, which makes it a fantastic value. I would definitely get the chicken again.  I also got to try some of the more expensive sashimi that my friends ordered, and they are definitely worth the price. They were noticeably bigger than the budget rolls I ordered and came with good sauces and a big chunk of fish on top.  Overall, this restaurant is actually a pretty good value for a fancier sushi spot. They have a dress code which isn't terribly strict, but definitely helps set some expectations. And their food is certainly higher quality. But their prices aren't outrageous.",

I personally always sit by the bar and order my hibachi there. The drinks are great and it's a slightly fancier vibe for the southside side. They have great sushi options and quick service. They offer a rewards card that keeps track of points for your visits which is great too!  They have a decent happy hour with specials on drinks and food. I always have a great meal and a great time!

    "text": "First of all myself and my wife love hibachi grills. We decided to venture here for our anniversary for a nicer-than-normal dinner.   Upon pulling up on the side street in front of Nakama there is a valet that takes your car. It is worth it as there is not much parking along Carson Street or around it.   Entering the restaurant you are greeted by the bar and a hostess. At first glance the restaurant seems to have great natural light, but that quickly dissipates when you enter the hibachi grill section. It is poorly lit with minimal lighting. It was very hard to us to read our menus and I even had to pull out my phone to use the flashlight. (Makes me seem like I'm old). Once we ordered our appetizer and our dinners, the waiter seemed to be running around 2 other tables, and stopped at our table only twice during the whole time we were there; once to pick up our salad and soup dishes, and the second time to pick drop off/pick up our checks.  Dinner was ok. Ok in the food was over salted and the chef didn't seem into it at all while cooking. I ordered the three course dinner which included steak, chicken, and shrimp and for the price I recieved a ton of chicken, a decent bit of steak, but tiny shrimps. I exchanged the steamed rice with the Udon noodles which I thought ok a couple of dollars charge, but they charged almost $7 for some noodles. Maybe it was just me but I thought that was outrageous.   Overall, if you are looking for good food at a decent price, this is not it. They upcharge for all add-ons pretty heavily and you are better off going to another hibachi grill.",

We've been twice since moving back... and both times disappointed. The first time, we went for sushi and sat at the sushi bar. The sushi was underwhelming but we thought maybe we were being too harsh since we were used to the fresh fish of Florida.   The second time we went back, we had a lovely waitress whose name now escapes me. We had a reservation but it was incredibly slow. We ended up having an entire table for just the two of us! We ordered our meals, and of course I asked for mine to be cooked gluten free. There was some sort of confusion between the waitress and the chef that led the chef to speak to her in a horrible demeanor right in front of us. It made me feel bad for ordering. After a conversation with the manager, waitress and chef - he finally proceeded to make our meal. He refused to use the gluten free soy sauce and I even tried to hand it to him. It was a horrible experience, and he made me feel uncomfortable even eating my meal.  The manager stopped by again to check on us and we explained what a horrible experience it was overall. First, the chef berated the waitress in front of us. Then, he refused to make our meal the agreed upon way. The manager did comp our meal, and the two stars here are for the manager and server!  I will never come back here again though for the way the chef treated the server and myself. On a positive note, I did go home and doctor up my food with gluten free soy sauce to add some flavor.",

If it had been busy, though, at least that would have been a good excuse for the terrible service.   There were 3 bartenders working, but they were more concerned with the conversations amongst themselves than with taking our order or checking in on us. Once we finally got our order taken, they forgot what we had ordered, and we had to ask again.   We had three sushi rolls which were all amazing, but unfortunately not worth the awful service that we experienced.",

The sushi was not great- it was kind of falling apart and the flavors were just not fresh and vibrant. It was almost bland. I did really enjoy the chicken lettuce wraps they offer, but the Gyoza I ordered was almost chicken pot pie like...?  -The atmosphere is good here- perhaps I had a somewhat poor experience because I sat at the sushi bar which created confusion. Perhaps the habatchi service/bar area they offer will provide more positive tones.  -The atmosphere is lively and the location is in the heart of Southside.

The hibachi was also very tasty - my filet was cooked perfectly and the fried rice is worth the upcharge.  The service however - ehhhhh.

I loved my hibachi meal, bobs favorite triple combo, in which you would get chicken, shrimp, and steak along with rice and veggies.   This meal was amazing. Definitely an intimate setting outside of hibachi tables can also be reserved if you do not want to watch your food be cooked before you.   Tip: ask for extra rice and you can have extra yumminess to enjoy the next day as your left overs.",

However, being that nakama is in the Southside - where all the bars and club scenes are, it may seem like more of a bar type environment rather than a sushi and hibachi restaurant.  Reasoning why it doesn't get a full 5 stars is due to how expensive it can be! Dinner for 2,  a person can easily spend 60-70$ during dinner time.  That's why I like to hit the lunch time special where it's half the price - but also half the food but you still get your hibachi fix!",

As a young professional, I am offended at the lack of cheese and desperation in this place on any given weekend.  Is anyone themselves anymore?  Are people that desperate to keep up fake appearances and be someone that they are not?  That is the vibe that I get in this place.  Sorry to those who love it, but I know for certain I am not the only one who feels this way.  Sushi here is mediocre at best... I have had way better elsewhere (and I cannot believe I am going to say this- even Cleveland had many way better sushi options that Pittsburgh!- I love this city but we are lacking in options!).  If you sit at the bar or sushi bar, you will leave smelling like a Hibachi as well (wish there was something that they could do about this- if people want to stink, they would sit at the Hibachi tables I am sure).  Service is meh... I have had one great server the many times I have been there (I was forced to have work dinners there based on customer demands way too often, and one of my friends loves this place for a quick dinner so I have been here a lot).  I recommend a martini here... they at least are good.  Other drinks have seemed pretty weak.    I wish I could say better things being a resident of the Southside who prefers to stay local on weekends, but I cannot.",

    "text": "I have been to Nakama for many happy hours in my earlier professional days.  Recently, I arrived for sushi with my friend Katie around 7:30 PM on a Thursday (great downtime to get a seat at the bar following their popular happy hour).  This was an impromptu outing after assisting Katie with some logistics for this year's Silk Screen Gala & Film Festival.  We started with beverages and placed an order of edamame.  They definitely place a good amount of sea salt on those green soy goodies, which I LOVE.  Thursday is ladies night, which allows 1/2 off of a selection of mixed drinks, beers and/or house wines.  Together, we surveyed the area, making up fun and comical stories about our fellow bar patrons.  #Goodtimes  Next, we placed our order for sushi (the main entree), cleansing our palates each with  a salad.  I had the Nakama salad with their yummy ginger dressing.  Katie had a spectacular cucumber salad, mixed with soy sauce, sesame seeds and red pepper bites.  Finally, the sushi arrived in its artistic and flawless state.  Fresh and colorful, we each chose 2 types (totaling 4): Asparagus Tempura, Spicy Tuna Roll, Baked Alaskan (our favorite), and a Hawaiian roll. Nakama has a moderate to high price point which makes sense, due to their prime location in Pittsburgh's South Side neighborhood and terrific ambiance.  I will definitely be going back.  Oh, and knowing that we ate so healthy (minus the salt and soy sauce) made for a non-bloated ride home.  #30somethingproblems  Review can be found on my website as well:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwp.me%2Fp43vGR-YX&s=1fc77190a9da8b31f2a142295f9ced942823fcf31075ce3a62803a500730faf1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wp.me/p43vGR-YX</a>",

They have a couple chefs that put on a crazy good show.  If you get one of them, you are in luck.  They each seem to have their quirks.  It isn't the typical show of a little bit of flame and a shrimp tail in the hat.  The sushi bar and regular bar are where Nakama really shines.  Nakama has a great bar scene and good sushi.  The sushi isn't the best in the city, but it is well done.  The fish to rice ratio is great and they have a diverse selection of pretty sushi rolls for people who want to go beyond your standard single fish product and rice.  I'd strongly recommend Nakama if you want some good sushi and drinks in a upscale busy bar environment.  If you are looking for an 'authentic' sushi / hibachi experience, this is not the place.  Nakama fits the Southside scene.  You hit Nakama before a club or party bar.",

Since it was cooked last you basically had to eat rice and vegetables if you wanted hot food or sit there and let your food get cold while you waited for the rest of it.

The wait staff is generally sour and unprofessional. We came in on a Monday afternoon and they clearly struggled to find hibachi seating arrangements during this slow period.   Luckily, on this Monday, we were able to get the one chef with a modicum of talent and personality. When Nakama first opened, all of the chefs were friendly and full of tricks. That's what we come for. The whole point of hibachi restaurants is to be entertained, not just sit around a sweaty table. Most of Nakama's chefs nowadays will just sit there in silence as they grill your steak.   The food is still good for the most part, although the sushi isn't very fresh, and they have a tendency to bring appetizers during or after your main course.   A lot has changed over the years. Between the loud music on weekends, reward cards, and specials, it's clear Nakama is trying to do too much instead of just concentrating on good hibachi. The bar makes a killing on weekends, though, so I doubt they'll change.   As an aside, they have a broken \"gong\" that they ring on your birthday, except that they deaden the noise, so it sounds like a fork hitting a table. Come on guys!",

However, since I'm going solo tonight I have no problem finding a place at the sushi bar.  I'm tended to promptly and pleasantly by my server who helps me determine which tuna I would prefer for my sushi selection and lets me know it is very fresh tonight.  I end up with eel, salmon, and tuna plus a salad with ginger dressing and a glass of plum wine.    My server checks on me, the sushi chef at the sushi bar serves me my sushi and it is a nice portion and tastes very fresh and just the right serving temperature.  I'm a happy camper as I do love my sushi.  The price is in line with any sushi restaurant.  I spent about $32.00 plus tip for 6 pieces of sushi, a salad, and a glass of wine.  They do have the hibachi tables and usual fare and fanfare that goes with it.  Plusses:  No TV in the sushi bar and no salt and pepper shakers alongside the soy sauces.  :-)  Been seeing that a lot lately so was glad it wasn't the case here.  The only down side is the volume level of noise which I would attribute to poor acoustics, perhaps?  Not a problem for me dining alone but if I was with someone and wanted to carry on a conversation, I think there would have been a lot of \"Huh?  What'd you say?;s\".    I'd definitely come here again.",

My friend and I sat down at the bar, and it took the bartender about ten minutes to come over. I ordered a beer and my friend wanted to taste it before ordering one herself. After dropping off my drink, the bartender walked away and didn't come back for another ten minutes to take my friends drink order. After dropping that one off, walked away for another twenty minutes before taking our food orders. When I ordered, I asked to modify my sushi order a little and her exact response was \"whatever, you're eating it, not me\", and when I ordered a dish, it was \"oh that's my absolute favorite but we don't make it anymore\". If it's on the menu, shouldn't it be available? I asked for the sushi first and said I would decide on a main course after that came out. The sushi came out, and the order was completely wrong. After it had been sitting there and I tried to flag her down, she came over (again, about 20 minutes later) and just threw it in the trash right in front of us. Rolled her eyes and told me that I should have \"explained what I wanted\". Having now spent an hour here, we had just wanted to pay for our beers and leave, no longer wanting food. When I spoke with the manager, all she said was \"this is the first complaint I've ever gotten about her\", and walked away. Wish I could give zero stars just based off of the terrible service.",

    "text": "Here's a little story about why I won't be going to Nakama again. We were eating our dinner when a group of women came in to eat. They had all been at the pool all day and had dried out in the sun and were ready for some Sushi. I heard them all talking about how this was their favorite place and they have birthday celebrations there all the time. The manager approached them and told one girl in particular that she had to \"cover herself.\" She said, \"I'm wearing a cover-up and shorts.\" To this, he left them be and they sat at the bar. They order a full meal and are waiting on their drinks. The manager approaches the group of women again and says, \"You have to cover yourself up or I'll have to ask you to leave.\" She is mortified and confused. Her friends say to him, \"She'll make sure that it's buttoned all the way. Is that ok?\" He says that isn't acceptable because you can still tell there is a swimsuit under the shirt. While this was True, it was no more revealing than being able to see the outline of a bra through a blouse. BUT THAT'S NOT EVEN THE POINT. \"You have to cover yourself or I'll have to ask you to leave.\" Now I know you can't sit in a restaurant wearing only a swimsuit. And these women knew that, too. They were prepared with shorts, wraps, skirts, dresses, everything. One friend asked him what would happen if a woman came in with a shirt that was meant to be sheer, what would he do? No response. \"You'll have to cover yourself or I'll have to ask you to leave.\" At this point, the woman's friends decide they have had enough humiliation from this man and decide they will take their business elsewhere. A few other patrons who have not yet ordered show their support and leave as well. The woman sits with her cover-up wrapped around her and says, \"I would like to finish my water, and then I will leave.\" Cool as a cucumber. Her friends wait for her outside as she finishes her water. The police walk in. THE POLICE. He called the police on a woman who was fully clothed with a swimsuit underneath her shirt who was quietly drinking water. The Policemen tell the girl to wait outside with her friends and they'll see what's going on. They talk with the manager and then meet the women outside. As we leave, I tell the group that I am so sorry they had to deal with that humiliation. I hear the policeman say, \"You can't take it personally. Call corporate if you feel it was inappropriate.\" Truly trying to be polite and understanding. But here's the thing. Please don't tell a woman who is being publicly punished for having a body not to take it personally. They were fully clothed. They were not wet. They were not causing a problem. They just happened to be a group of women dressed for summer.  This was my first time here, and I can also get better sushi at Jade Grille in Mt. Lebo. And our plates for the soy sauce were filthy. So there's ALSO that.",

The sushi was still good (again, for the area and what we have available to us) and we tried some of our friend's hibachi and the steak was really good - hence the reason I'll still give three stars. This time, I ordered my beloved strawberry citrus-tini martini. While the drink itself was the same, the rim didn't have the same amazing blue sugar. And....there was some sort of hair or something of some sort in my drink...that I discovered AFTER drinking some of the drink. I'm still grossed out by it. Can I, will I return? I'm not so sure.",

It really seemed like they cared about the little details.   The restaurant was very clean and decorated nicely. It has a large bar and sushi in the front. I really liked the open design and tall ceilings because it gave the feeling of having a lot of space.   The wait staff was very friendly and very prompt with service and bringing drinks.   I wouldn't say that it was any more busy/noicey then any other hibachi type restaurant. These always draw crowds and tend to be noisy. The pricing is also on par with any other restaurant of this type.   If I had a complaint was it did take a little long for our cook to come out.  They did serve soup and salad quickly.   I would go again and recommend it to friends.",

Plus, they charge you for extras, like $3 extra for fried rice instead of white rice. Kind of ridiculous. The 3 of us shared a bottle of sake because it was $30/bottle so it was the cheapest option. Also, I told 4 people it was his birthday and they were supposed to bring dessert and ring a gong... but that never happened.",

The crab fritters were pretty good and crab-y if you are in the mood for something fried and not soaking in oil. We didn't do the hibachi, but the sushi was good. The toro jalapeno roll was pretty creative. The food is NOT overpriced for the whole package.

    "text": "I've tried to like Nakama, I really have. There is a serious shortage of good sushi in the Southside.....as in there are only two places to go for it. With the renovation and new ownership of the old Sushi Two into Tokyo Bistro, Nakama has dropped to last place (or 2nd), for Sushi in south side.   Nakama has style. The interior is gorgeous. This is where it all ends and goes south though. The food is very uninspired, the waits for a table are unbelievable (and unwarranted), presentation has gone downhill over the years - and the worst part: the crowd.  For some reason, Nakama has turned into a singles scene. Please explain to me how a sushi & hibachi restaurant is now a meat-market? (fish market? hehe) Any given night of the week, you will find scantily clad fake women (could be a good thing), and old rich perverts trying to pick them up......cougars, suburbanites, screaming children....it's nuts. At peak dinner hours, you literally have to fight your way through everything. You'd think you stepped into Town Tavern by accident or something!  The other issue, and the reason why I am marking it bad for groups, is the lack of larger tables dedicated solely to sushi eaters. If you have a large group of people, you may as well pass. You can either camp out and wait for a bunch of seats to open up at the sushi bar, or sit at a hibachi grill - which is terrible for the cook if everyone in your party wants sushi.  Here are some final pros to balance this out a little bit and explain why I gave it two stars:  - Great drinks...best bloody mary I've had. - Awesome for late night food once it clears out - Good lunch specials - The aforementioned interior space  But if you really want good sushi, go to Umi in Shadyside or Pennsylvania Fish Company on Penn Ave in the strip. Nakama is not the place.",

I went in with good expectations of this place considering it is always crowded.....boy was I wrong!!!  First off the service at this place is horrible. This is mostly a 22-28 yr old staffed place. The hostess basically laughed at me when I said we did not have a reservation, offered us to have a drink at the bar, and then said \"but you cannot stand around in this area here around the door it is getting too crowded so either the bar or maybe wait outside\" ...seriously you don't tell a customer that.   We just wanted sushi anyways, so we sat at the sushi bar and ordered some rolls and sashimi. Now maybe I am spoiled from living on the west coast for so long now that I am used to Asians (usually Japanese..go figure) working and making my sushi. There were 3 white guys about 25 yrs old making my rolls for me, not to say they cannot do it as well as anyone else, but the rolls were seriously not that great.  Hell I did not even see an Asian person working at the tables either, they were mostly Mexican guys.   Sorry, I know most of the reviews are raving about how good this place is, but to me it seems pretty pricey for what you get and the food is not all that. I can only speak for the sushi...maybe the dinners at the tables are better. To sum it up this is mostly an over priced sushi bar that is a good place to hang out and have drinks with friends and maybe hit on some groups of women out for dinner.",

I always start with basic items when ordering sushi at a new restaurant - had salmon, tuna, shrimp and eel nigiri and a cucumber maki.  The fish was fresh, with decent texture, the cucumber was crispy, and overall Nakama might have taken over the number 2 sushi restaurant spot in my heart.",

In the bathroom I heard the hostess complaining about how backed up they were and that she wanted to tell the complaining guests \"I don't know you, I don't care\". This attitude aside, the rest of our service was really good. It was slow-going on getting drinks, but I could tell our server was really rushed. Hats off to the people at our \"grill\" who were going to the bar to buy drinks. It gets hectic at hibachi places, and they did a pretty good job for being as busy as they were. Our hibachi chef was awesome and adorable. He was really a lot of fun, and you could tell he knew what he was doing.  The drinks were reasonably priced, as was the menu. I think it was about $45.00 for me by myself with a hibachi meal and two Kettle One cocktails. The shrimp was good, and the steak was really tender. The fried rice was definitely not the best hibachi-fried rice I have ever had, but it hit the spot. I really liked their miso soup, it didn't have tofu, which made me happy!  I would love to go back and try the sushi, although I will probably avoid coming here during a peak hour, whether or not I have reservations. Definitely better than Benihana, although I have had better hibachi.",

    "text": "Friday May 15 my friend had reservations for 9:00PM for a surprise birthday dinner at Nakama. Because of Nakama's strict seating policy when it comes to reservations, she spoke directly to a manager, and requested that the guests be allowed to sit before the guest of honor arrived so that it would in fact be a \"surprise\". The manager agreed and assured her that there would be no problem granting that request.   The guests arrived at 8:30 PM and informed the host that we were all present for our 9 PM reservation. The host told us we would be called when it was available.   We were still waiting in the bar to be seated at 10PM. An hour after the guest of honor arrived, (so much for the surprise). When we were finally seated everyone ordered appetizers and drinks right away. It took 20 minutes to receive our drinks. And believe me, I'm not exaggerating for effect here; I was timing it on my watch. My appetizers arrived at about 10:30.    We placed our dinner orders shortly before the apps showed up, which would be around 10:25. The chef did not arrive to start cooking until 10:50.   I addressed this with the server who gave me excuses about the shortage of chefs and how they were backed up, but I noticed people who arrived after us, who were also seated before us (with comparable party numbers) were almost finished with their meals before our chef arrived.  The waiter clearly didn't understand that I wasn't interested in excuses and passed me onto a manager. The manager apologized and went to grab a chef for us. However when the meal was finally cooked and served it was 11:30. All after we were supposed to be seated at 9.   On of the couple's who was with us, never received an appetizer after waiting for 1.5 hours. The appetizer was Ahi Tuna, which requires NO cooking. The manager offered a free dinner, but by that time our friends were so disgusted that they left.   I have to say that we were one of the last tables to leave the seating area, which was after midnight. We spent way too much money on drinks while we were waiting to be seated and eat our dinner. No one at the table was compensated for the aggravation. One of the girls at the table is a newscaster for channel 4, and I would love to see her comment on the negative experience we had.   I strongly urge people who are interested in a hibachi style dining experience to seek other venues. If it is sushi you are interested in, try the Downtown Fish Market, Umi, or Yakoso.",

    "text": "I really wish this place was great, but unfortunately, the decor does not make up for the mediocre sushi and the abhorrent clientele.  That place during happy hour reminds me of a Bosch painting, except for populated by yuppies instead of the naked damned.  The waitstaff is decent, but the hibachi chefs are kind of weak.  If you go on the weekend, you can have an awkward conversation about how loud you pee with the bathroom attendant.  I guess there's not a lot of small talk to be had.  I have had fun in this place, but I can have fun pretty much anywhere.  Oh, and if it is crowded, good luck hearing a word that anybody says.",

    "text": "I went to Nakama on Saturday for my birthday. I had a party of 9 and told the hostess my friend was in traffic and would be late. She insisted they could not seat us until everyone in my party arrived which to me seemed to inconvenience them more because we were occupying the lobby and seemed to be in the way. Once seated, it took long to get everything. A long wait to order drinks, then receive our drinks, then long to take our order. My reservation was for 8 and by 8:45 we hadn't even put our food order in. I ordered a margarita and 30min later I still hadn't received it so my friend complained to the manager who was walking around. He was very apologetic and explained our waitress was actually a hostess and he bought me the margarita. That definitely saved the night and I am thankful for his generosity. The food is good, your basic hibachi food. I didn't order sushi but my friends seemed to enjoy it.",

We eat then we get the check not only did the server try to over charge for my meal heal sat in my face and told me that I asked for my meal to be separately rang up.  Why would I do that an it would cost more?  But any who then we go out to get my vehicle and it takes about ten minutes for him to come back with it. Now today I get a parking ticket in the mail talking about a parking violation!  But how I ask?  I don't know but guess who won't be eating here ever again.",

Overpriced, badly cooked...yep, bad hibachi shrimp. Way overdone and chewy. The chicken as well. The \"soup\" was made from a buillion cube.the salad was a nasty glob of something on some shitty lettuce. And our server was nice and attentive but too busy because they were understaffed. Finally, our hibachi \"chef\" said not a word nor did he smile. I think maybe he's there against his will. All this for $250! No thanks. Steer clear. They should be out of business soon and something decent in that nice location.",

Another disclaimer: I'm used to California sushi restaurants & chains (Japanese friends would have MUCH higher standards) and I haven't had good sushi since I've moved out to DC.  Friend & I shared: Pittsburgh Penguins Roll (when in Pittsburgh...), Spicy Squid Salad, Salmon Ceviche (cannot find on online menu), and Philadelphia roll (because somehow my friend has NEVER had it?)  Everything was really good! I especially liked the spicy squid salad and the salmon ceviche- the latter had pretty thick pieces of salmon but was so nicely presented that I didn't really mind at all (the same cannot be said for everyone.)   Overall: good, solid Japanese restaurant. Would go again.",

The quality of the food that night was bad also, we had the steak hibachi and it arrived cold and tasted like it was there since yesterday. The food quality was really bad in the last times I've been here and I wanted to give Nakama one last shot. After this time, NEVER TO COME BACK AGAIN.  The service was never that great and now the food quality has gotten just as bad + coming to a dirty table = really disappointed",

Throw it away and put a Xmas beer there. Or wait till may to do that...  Another case of the owners just milking the gravy of what they built. Can't blame them I guess. Place was really good 8 years ago when it had to be.  Update... 1/1/16  Had to meet a client there today. Black curly haired bartender acted like she was doing us a favor by giving us a menu.   SHE WAS RUDE AND IGNORANT!!! For zero reason. Just plain mean. If she is not an owner or related to them then she must have pictures of the owner in a compromising position. Otherwise who would want her in a service industry position.   She gave me a menu that looked like it was out in the rain for 3 days. Was really ignorant about it too. I just suggested we go somewhere much more worthy of our money so we left. But not before I apologized to her for being a bother by simply sitting down at the bar she was working.   Although I work on the south side and love sushi, I will never go back into this place. Zero management I guess. Sad...",

    "text": "If I had to describe Nakama in three words it would be \"Overpriced, Loud, Boring\". For a hibachi steak house, this place really doesn't seem to care about the whole, hibachi part. It basically is just watching someone cook food in front of you, there's no show, no flare, just a dude in a chefs hat frying your rice and leaving once you have your food. On top of that, for the price, the food is not even close to good enough to justify it, nor do you get enough of it. In all honesty if someone told me this place is only in business because of its location, I would believe them because the quality alone is not even close to enough to carry this place. I would not recommend going to this place, but I would recommend you check out Ichiban if you need your hibachi fix.",

My friend ordered a wine(Pinot Noir) but she came back with a Pinot Grigio, which is a common mistake and not too much of a big deal. But when she was asked to take back the drink she got snippy with us. She also had out chef confused with what she has written down and our food was going to the wrong plate. The occasion was my friends birthday and when another one of her friends came by she didn't want to take his drink order. She completely messed up our payments and got snippy with us when we were confused. Our overall experience with Haley was terrible. The only reason why I tipped her 20% was because I am also a server and know the struggle. The food was delicious and yum yum sauce is great, which is why I still recommend this place and love coming here when in town.",

It's pretty standard customer service to provide assistance in cleaning up spills, but nobody from Nakama offered to help with cleanup. When they're charging $69.99 for a strip steak, there's no excuse for the incredibly poor customer service that my mom experienced.",

    "text": "The events that took place yesterday afternoon at Nakama leave me ultimatley confused and extremely saddened. I no longer live in Pittsburgh, but it is still the place I consider home. What do you do when you come home to visit? You visit loved ones, celebrate birthdays, weddings, graduations, and you eat all of your favorite spots! I joked with friends, \"I CAN'T WAIT TO GO TO NAKAMA\"! Well never shall I step foot in that place again. I have celebrated birthdays, friends birthdays, celebrations, heck my family even took my GRANDMA there for her 91st birthday this past December! I've have birthday celebrations there with over 50 people! Long story short over the course of goodness 5+ years I have been a patron of Nakama. For Pittsburgh, this once was a place that was sort of a staple for the community. You take your friends from out of town there...It was simply thee place to meet a friend for a quick drink and appetizer, or for me a sports girl, even dine at the window and watch a game or two...NOT ANYMORE! Frankly once management changed and the playing cards came off the ceiling the service and FOOD was never the same! I'm not making this up, but I have seriously gotten sick several times, yet my simple behind would still go back because \"its Nakama\", \"it's my FAV\"! Even yesterday before we left SkyBar a friend reminded me, \"Girl last time you went there before you moved to NYC, you got sick!\" I was like OMG, you're right! Yet me and 7 other friends happily marched down to Nakama because we wanted to do an impromptu following of tradition a CELEBRATE A BIRTHDAY, quickly at the bar. We sat down ordered food and drinks, everything was fine... A manager comes over and says to my friend whose birthday it was... (of course he ruined her bday) you need to cover up we have a strict dress code. Now mind you my friend next to me had the same sheer sleeveless version over her bikini...My friend who the manager chose to point out, her cover up was long sleeve, floor length.. and she had on shorts. Why he chose to single out one girl and not the other puzzling if you catch my drift. Mind you..... our other friend had another cover up on who in my opinion was more scandalous than both of those put together! Anywho, we say okay, cool, she holds her cover closed and he walks away. By this time all drink and dinner orders had been placed and we saw another friend who thought we were still at SkyBar walk past the Nakama window, so my friend who had just been yelled at runs out to get her. Our friend who was just arriving has on a bikini top but BEFORE WALKING INTO NAKAMA SHE PUTS ON A SHIRT! My birthday friend comes in and sits down and the manager storms back over and begins yelling. He said something like I told you, you cant wear that in here and you will be asked to leave... Some people's food had actually begin to come out, so they are like huh?! We are eating?! He gets louder and louder... we were like look... she has buttons it's buttoned... Mind you we are at the bar...Seated! No one can really even tell what the heck you have on! We weren't in the dining room we were at the bar! And to top it off, it wasn't even busy! Other patrons were watching and making comments, after the discussion with the manager escalated because he was NOT being reasonable -he then told us to get out!? WHAT?!HUH?! I guess the customer isn't always right... They just lost hundreds of dollars over a bathing suit cover up (see picture) Other patrons were disgusted actually telling us sorry, that was rude and disgusting. I woke up this morning to a long post from a women saying how what she witnessed how it was degrading and uncalled for. Here's the best part my friend sat there to finish her water and the manager called the police! The Pittsburgh Police !They spoke2 the manager inside and then came out to speak to us and frankly, the cops thought it was a joke also. They said they aren't they dress code police they are the real police. This manager took time out of the cops day when they could have actually been needed elsewhere to whine about some swimsuit coverups! What a joke. I miss the old Nakama not this stuck up, stuffy one, with lying managers and clearly some personal problem with race... He clearly singled out my black friend and said nothing to my white friend and for what?!Why?! We were just coming there to do what we always do year after year celebrate a birthday! I had a flight back to NYC that night but I was willing to risk missing my flight just to eat a little bit of Nakama. Due to a flight change I ended up not even having time to eat because I missed my dinner opportunity due to an incompetent managers stupidity. Dear Nakama, my old friend who is fake and clearly has changed, you won't get another cent from me and all of my family and friends! Just how a random strangers post was able to make it to me on Facebook only hours later, she won't be returning nor will her friends! PGH is small so we will all continue to talk!",

Portion sizes were stingy and a joke for the price - It's like there was a nationwide shortage of shrimp. $4 for mushroom flambe that consisted of 8 sliced up pieces(total rip off). Tastes were bland and non-existent - onion soup tasted like Swanson beef broth straight out of the can. Things were left out of the order no soy sauce for the California roll, no chopsticks, and total lack of service. I would expect more from a so-called 5 star Japanese Steakhouse. I work hard for my money and will never waste it again on this hype. Save your time and money and just go to Ichiban.",

    "text": "Decent Hibachi food. Solid 3 stars.  My boyfriend and I came to Katama for a Hibachi dinner on a Wednesday night. We have high expectations when it comes to Hibachi because our taste buds have been acquired to meet the Hibachi standards of Nakato in Atlanta, however I will TRY my best to give an unbiased opinion.  To start off, Nakama was fairly empty for a Hibachi restaurant. We were seated immediately after arriving and ordered drinks. I orders the Slush Puppie which I thought would be a frozen mixed drink but instead it was not frozen at all and tasted like a melted Blue Raspberry Slushie from Quick Trip. For entrees, I ordered the Teryaki  chicken and my boyfriend ordered the Shrimp and Chicken. We noticed that the prices were on the more expensive side ranging from $18-40 with an additional charge of $3.75 for fries rice.  Our Hibachi chef came out moments later looking a bit unenthused and seemed to be new to the Hibachi grill. I sat patiently waiting for the big fire opening at the beginning of every Hibachi experience but this time it didn't happen. Our chef started right on the appetizers! I ordered the Shrimp appetizer which was pretty standard, and my boyfriend opted for the mushroom appetizer which was yummy. Next up came the vegetables lacking in flavor.. I ended up having to sprinkle my veggies with soy sauce for taste. The fried rice tasted a little off to me as well, as if it were cooked with margarine instead of the traditional Hibachi seasoned butter. Our entrees were decent but well portioned with enough to take home for left overs.   Overall, their Hibachi recipes lack in flavor and seasoning. The prices are comparable to Benihana's however the portion sizes provide enough for left overs.",

I think that it is all together an unnecessary charge; and even if the charge is somewhat of a requirement, ten dollars is too much. There ain't nothing wrong with some ladies wanting to split a hibachi meal.  BUT EDDY IS THE REAL OG. He works hibachi and he's an angel. That's all.",

We shared a triple combo and the chef was confused? / annoyed? that we were sharing...but we were glad we did in the end...between the two of us, we STILL had food left over.  Started us each out with a bowl of miso soup, and it had fried onions and mushrooms in it, which was different, and appreciated.  The salad was good with a yummy sauce and mixed greens, carrots and tomatoes. On the better side of the salads I've had like this.  Our combo had steak, shrimp, and chicken...and it was just... a TON of rice and a tonnn of veggies. It was delicious, but as usual it was on the saltier side. That is hibachi for you, though. Pretty good.  Our server didn't really put on a show. Not sure if he knew English that well. He did all the demos, but didn't interact with us too much as I've been used to in the past.",

    "text": "This used to be our favorite sushi & sashimi bar in Pittsburgh but it seems the quality & service are travelling down hill, or at least they were last night.  We went here for my birthday and were greeted by the hostess with a blank stare.  She didn't say anything...  Nothing...  So I said, 'Hi, we'd like a teppanyaki table', to which she responded with another blank stare.  Then I said 'Hibachi...' and she woke up and said, 'That'll be at least 15-20 minutes or so...' and then went back to her blank stare.  Nothing like, 'Would you like to grab seats at the bar? Start your meal off with a drink? How about a sushi roll while you wait...' nothing...  So I said, 'Ok, we'll wait...' and seated ourselves at the sushi bar.  It took at least 5 minutes for the actual waitress to appear and it seemed like it was a chore for her to get us a couple glasses of water.  She didn't offer any help picking out rolls or sushi so we were on our own.  We settled on a 'Steeler Roll' for $14.  Looking around at the closest hibachi table to us, I could see 6 people seated and 2 empty seats.  I figured they were waiting for someone- turned out they weren't.  I also assumed that maybe they had ordered already- they hadn't.  Had they ordered drinks already maybe- Nope...  It was obvious that the hostess just wanted to be ignorant and make us wait for another table.  Ok, fine.  She doesn't get tipped anyway.  So our roll arrives and we start in on it.  It tastes pretty good but the eel that we so love is being lost in the quantity of rice surrounding it.  It even had trouble staying together.  Then the hostess comes over and says 'Are you ready...?' to which I look at her, then at the roll, and say, 'We'll need a few minutes...'  On to the teppanyaki table...  The restaurant was super loud because I think there was an 'End of the Season Pittsburgh Steeler party' in the back room and they were making all kinds of commotion so I can't fault the waiter on how hard it was for all of us to hear him.  Oh, by the way- our table was only half full when they started service.  There was my wife & I and another couple.  Maybe they were trying to get us in & out quickly, I don't know...  Our waiter started to take our orders and I heard him offer the couple next to us, 'Would you like to upgrade your white rice for fried for an additional charge?' and they both said no.  Looking in the menu, I see that a side of fried rice without any purchase is $3.29 so when it came time for us to order, he offered the same thing and I asked him how much the 'upcharge' was.  $3.29 was his response.  Why wouldn't he just ask if we'd like an additional side of fried rice for $3.29 instead of making it sound like you were getting a better deal by declining the white rice in favor of fried for $3.29???  Stuff like this really bothers me so I told him, 'I would like fried rice but I also want the steamed rice I'm already paying for...' to which he says, 'Fine with me man, I don't care how much rice I bring out...'  Nice customer service...  Anyway, we ended up with the only American teppanyaki chef in the entire place, and he was just getting over bronchitis or something because he barely spoke and when he did, it was in a very low tone.  Don't get me wrong- he was a very nice guy...  My wife had ordered the Bob's Triple Combo (Strip steak, Chicken & Shrimp) and I ordered the Chef's Choice (Strip steak & Chicken).  They were both delicious and aside from the service issues, we had a very nice meal.    We both agreed though- next time we're going out for sushi- we're going to Sake at South Side Works.  The chefs are much friendlier, the fish is fresher and the prices are much more reasonable (Half price on Sunday's & Monday's)",

So we ask if we could switch the seats they were offering us and they did. When the waiter arrived it was apparent he had an attitude. He asked us what we wanted to drink and was there anything else we wanted. We weren't given any menus I asked for a menu and he only brought us one menu and there was two of eating. After noticing his rude and annoying attitude wasn't going away, we decided to just get up and leave without even ordering. This nakama has the worst service.",

So, I was a littel surprised when my wine was beyond syrupy.  Then I ordered a specialty roll.  Honestly, I ordered a cooked tempura sushi with avocado.  It came drowned in about three different sauces.  It wasn't compelling. On the positive side, service was fast and friendly. The place was crowded and people seemed to be having a great night.

Even though it was still \"lunch time \" they fired up the hibachi table for just the two of us! Luke was our chef, and he was awesome!! We had a blast, and we'll definitely be back!! Also, the prices for the lunch menu were discounted, win win in my book!!",

The atmosphere is lively, but still conducive to conversation.  The Hanalei Roll, a tempura flash fried sushi roll, is my very favorite sushi roll.   The cocktails are tasty and extremely strong. The Slush Puppie Martini is my favorite!",

    "text": "While this is still primarily a Japanese hibachi, it is clearly better than the numerous chains that have been popping up everywhere. The major difference being the quality of the ingredients and cooks. My steak and seafood is always cooked perfectly to temperature, which can be spotty at some of the competitors. Also, I would rate the sushi here among the best in Pittsburgh. Also you can get some menu items you just don't find elsewhere. I particularly like the Diablo preparation with a spicy sauce and soba noodles.   The one knock would be the showmanship can be pretty hit or miss here depending who you get and there is really no innovation. A pretty standard show.",

My husband and I are what I like to call fake-sushi fans, so we got a California Roll and a Spicy California Roll cuz we were feeling craaaazy that day. We also ordered the coconut shrimp. Everything came out in a reasonable amount of time, although the shrimp came out a couple minutes AFTER our sushi, and I would have preferred it before.  The sushi was well prepared and very tasty. The rolls stuck together just right and had good flavors. The sauce on the spicy rolls had just the right amount of heat. I know, there's not much to a California roll, but what can I say? We're sushi wimps. The coconut shrimp was nearly on par with Red Lobster's coconut shrimp (which are the best coconut shrimp out there) but a teensy bit dry. This was remedied by the yummy, spicy sauce on the side (strangely reminiscent of the sweet chili sauce McDonald's had out during the Olympics...)  All in all the service was great and we enjoyed our food, so we'll be back. The lunch hibachi prices are very reasonable so we hope to try that next time.",

The actual serving of food is last on its list of priorities, which run something like this: 1) Having heavily-made-up waitresses treat diners rudely. 2) Functioning as a place for bald-headed men to drink. 3) Using \"valet parking\" to totally tie up the intersection of 17th and Carson. 4) Being a mediocre-to-poor Americanized \"Japanese\" restaurant.  I had sushi the only time I came here (probably about three years ago).  It was really bad.  Cold, rubbery rice that not only didn't have any rice vinegar in it, but wasn't properly cooked.  Rolls looked like they had been created in a fit of pique by a drunken marmot or other mammal lacking opposable thumbs.  And the fish, while not being actively spoiled, was not notable for its freshness either.  If you want hibachi, try Yokoso.  If you want excellent, authentic sushi, try Chaya in Squirrel Hill.  If you want pretty decent, cheap sushi, try Oishii Bento in Oakland.  But for the love of god, don't come here for any reason.",

Nakama totally did not live up to the hype for me. I had the hibachi and it was just mediocre. The chef / entertainer wasn't even that good - no cool tricks and he didn't even try throwing food in my mouth. The place was so loud that there is no way you can have a decent conversation if you come with a group of people. And, I swear they celebrated 10 birthdays during the hour we were dining there. They have this irritating gong that they bring out. You can't hear the guy next to you, but you will hear every birthday dinner that night.   A bunch of my co-workers like Nakama's sushi bar, so when I get a chance to try it, I'll update my review. Until then, I'm not quickly planning my next Nakama outing.",

Despite the money we dropped, the service was horrible, simply put; unprofessional, rude, and snotty.  Now, this place has nothing to be uppity about: THEY DO NOT EVEN UNDERSTAND WHAT SUSHI IS. It was Americanized to the extreme, the menu was embarrassing, as with the wine and sake list. The sashimi was so poorly cut you could barley chew on it, the maki was not tightly rolled. And the fish... oh the fish, no flavor.  The hipster crowd should of tipped me off, this is place for people who do not know anything about dining, and probably only eat sushi because they think it's the cool thing to do. The crowd was nothing but meat heads and trashy looking girls, the music selections we're bottom of the barrel, and the blaring sports tv's would ruin anyones dinner who cares.",

The meat didn't taste very fresh, the soup and salad were both forgettable, and the fried rice was AWFUL.  I can't understand why this place is so popular, my best guess is that some people consider it a \"classy\", \"cultured\" destination to get drunk at.

You know the kind... \"I'm really jonesin for some sushi, but I guess I'll take the old salmon stuck on top of crunchy cold rice because I'm too lazy to put my ass in the car and drive to Sushi Kim or some other real sushi bar.\"  The hibachi: Quality level on par with Benihana.  Enough said.  It reminds me of what a chef friend of mine said about the Spaghetti warehouse one day: \"Fancy Ragu\".  The hibachi was fancy canned chop suey.  Oh, and the price.  One adult and one 14 year old lunch (2 small plates of sushi and 2 hibachi lunches) $80.00.  Someone hand me the Astroglide.  Quick.  I've been sampling these kinds of establishments on both coasts for the past 15 years, from Vancouver BC to San Diego, from Miami to Boston.  For what they charge, the quality should be much better and the staff should TRY to smile once in a while.  Sorry, honey, but tight skirt and 17 layers of makeup can't hide a mean heart.

I went here for lunch on my wedding day! So when I moved recently, it's been a quest to get back there again. And then today happened...      I went today, expecting a pleasant and entertaining experience. Unfortunately, I didn't get what I was expecting. I went there, expecting the full knife-tossing, food-flaming experience. Instead, I got a cook who cooked out food with his head down, barely daring to even speak with us. Half of the table's food was finished cooking before he even started the other half, leaving my friends to make the decision to eat before us or wait till their food was cold. I kept waiting for him to set our meal aflame. It's my absolute favorite thing about hibachi restaurants. But it never happened. He finished cooking in silence, cleaned the cooktop, and left.      Now, I don't want to be entirely negative. The food WAS as delicious as I expected. Out waitress was very friendly and attentive. When one friend ordered the Nakama Panda (drink) and they were out of panda mugs, she provided us with a Lucky Cat mug instead.      This experience has left a bad taste in my mouth, but I sincerely hope and expect it to be better next time I go back. And I will. One less-than-expected trip will not spoil this fantastic restaurant for me!",

    "text": "Today was my first experience at Nakama. I walked in with a group of 30 - 35 people and asked to be sat at the sushi bar. I was disappointed with the hostess when she told me  the sushi bar does not have that many seats. I suspected she was lying to me because at least two of the members of my group were black. So i asked if they could accommodate two, me and my piece. They happily said yes and informed us it was all self seating. I was genuinely surprised by the lack of Asian servers. Most of the servers were white. When the server came of i snidely requested a glass of their most expensive champagne, only to throw a hissy fit when I found out the brand was not one I enjoyed. I honestly had no idea of the names this was all in an attempt to seem pretentious and impress my piece I was with. After I got done humiliating the server I asked her for \"just a water, with extra lemons on the side\". I also asked for some obscure sweetener I knew they did not have. I rolled my eyes and said sweet n low will do. The sushi menu was archaic. There were no pictures of anything. It didn't help that the sushi bar has all the raw  fish and everything they use in their rolls in a glass case right in front of you at the bar. I was very upset when i couldn't find totinos pizza rolls on the menu, so I went with a crunchy Philly roll. I had no idea what to expect because as I said, there were no pictures. The sushi chef handed me my food directly as to intimidate me. I took it without flinching. The ho i was with seemed very pleased with her order. I on the other hand immediately told the server that wasn't what I ordered. I asked her what was in it and she began to list the ingredients, including uncooked salmon. I then began listing a number of diseases and sickness' you can obtain from eating raw sea food. I demanded she take it back and just get me a side of fries. Go figure, they didn't have french fries. So I ordered a well done filet and asked for ketchup, which they also didn't have. I explained to her that the Heinz ketchup factory was right across the bridge I was completely baffles as to how they did not have ketchup. Nevertheless, my steak was quite good and my partner enjoyed her meal so much that I scored so hard later that night, after 4 hours of heavy drinking followed by 10 minutes of me insisting to my piece I was fine to drive home. Overall Nakama was a great experience and I tipped my server $40,000.",

It was crowded and loud, why the dance music at sushi place?   The food was OK, the shrimp was a solid B, the strip steak was B+ but everything else was just average. The Japanese soup which is usually chicken based was mushroom based, yuck.  The small salad was trenched in too much dressing. The rice was decent, the sauce on the meals was just average. The check arrives with a higher price than the menu's. Turns out fried rice was $3.29 more than white, it would have been nice if the server told us ahead of time!

My sister got the spider rolls and I ended up stealing a few because they were so tasty. I live in Chicago, and the prices were pretty comparable to cheaper sushi there, so it was a great deal. My sister keeps saying we have to go back over the holidays, and I definitely agree!

It's pricey, but the taste is a significant experience for me because I love steak.  Note, I am getting rolls and not nigiri or sashimi (go to Umi for that!).    I have been disappointed often times with the \"performance\" of the chef.  From an entertainment perspective, I've seen better, but the most important aspect is the food and I've always had it well prepared.    The drinks are well mixed in my experience.  I even ordered the one with the glowing ice cube once, which was great, if only for the ice cube and ensuing ridicule.  They offer a limited wine selection, but there are 1 or 2 decent options by the glass.  The place is definitely packed all the time, which either makes for good people watching or is sure to annoy you -- it depends what kind of person you are.  I happen to enjoy the crowd.  The bathroom attendant is a bit much though.  Yeah, it's pricey, but you get a lot of food.  Most times everyone I'm with ends up taking some for the road.",

My random childhood friend's boss told me I should come here to meet interesting people.    I went for drinky times.  I brought a City Paper with me, as I was alone and needed some entertainment.  I sat at the bar for about 20 minutes, watching everyone around me get served.  Two large, bald headed gentlemen sidled up and were taken care of immediately by the bartender.  Still nothing in front of me.    Eventually I was asked \"Are you OK?\" at which point I requested a drink list.  Now, I don't really go in for too much mixed alcohol or sweet stuff, so I ended up just ordering a Pearl (cold-unfiltered) sake.  I'm not sure what people see in this place.  I mean, the bar scene is almost all large and/or old(er) people who usually happen to be bald if they possess a scrotum.  I mean, that's fine, that's cool.  Just not what I consider a \"happening scene\".    Also, my bartender made me taste the sake before giving it to me.  I thinke maybe he thought I didn't know what I was ordering.  To be fair, I was the only one in the whole bar drinking sake, so maybe they don't sell that much of it.  The food may be tasty, but I was warned that it would \"give me the poops\".  Can't verify that though.    Has anyone else noted the playing cards stuck to the ceiling?  That's pretty cool.  I also like the exposed pipes.  It's really not so bad from a design standpoint.  Just a Pittsburgh kind of place, I guess...",
