    "text": "My bff accompanied me to the Waterfront this past Saturday for some shopping. My friend, fellow yelper Carrie W, has had burgers from Burgatory before, just not this location. We have tried, unsuccessfully, on two other occasions to eat here. However, the wait was simply too long. One Saturday night at 7:30 the wait was an hour and a half....and I simply refuse to wait that long for any meal.  We lucked out this weekend, however. It was 3pm, and I was hoping that there wouldn't be much of a wait, if any, since it was neither lunch or dinner time. We did have a wait, but it wasn't more than 10 minutes. The hostess offered to text my friend when our table was ready, which gave us the freedom to shop around instead of just standing around.  The food was delicious. We both opted to create our own burger. I chose the All Natural Chicken on a Whole Wheat bun, Angel Dust rub and Horseradish Cheddar cheese....which was yummy!....as well as some veggie toppings and ranch on the side. My friend got the Dry Aged Wagyu burger, also on a Whole Wheat bun. Both of us opted for the salad instead of sweet potato fried chips, for an up-charge of $1.50. Totally worth it. The salads came out with the burgers, and took up the majority of the plate. Not some cheap salad with iceburg lettuce and croutons. Oh, no. Mixed greens with tomatoes, nuts, cheese....and the balsamic dressing was good too.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive, as much as you can be when the place is packed. The only downsides I would say came from my friend's side. She ordered her burger medium rare, which is certainly was not (no pink at all, in fact). However, she did say that it was tasty, regardless. Also, IPAs are $8....pricey. Sorry, maybe I'm just a little on the cheap side.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal. The only real negative is that this place is simply too small and, really, not the coziest. Anyone who has read my past reviews knows that I am a fan of comfort. There are a lot of tables and most of the booths are those half booths, with one side being a bench seat and the other a regular old chair. I do think that Burgatory will be a success, despite their being so many failed businesses in this spot previously. That being said, add more comfy booths and expand. Other than that, great place for lunch or dinner!",

    "text": "I have mixed opinions about Burgatory.   The decor is super cute and the waitress was friendly but the service was quite slow and the menu was all over the place.   We came in on a rainy afternoon while running some errands. I honestly didn't want a burger but I assumed they'd have a salad or sandwich I'd be happy with and so we sat down and explored the menu. The waitress told us that any of the burgers on the menu we were not allowed to change. It's part of the rules. They have a checklist where you can create your own burger if you wanted to customize it. I didn't mind that until I realized you're paying much more if you just wanted a small adjustment.   My husband went for a custom bison burger which he really enjoyed. My sister got the portobello sandwich and enjoyed it. I ordered the roasted turkey sandwich with the tomatoes on the side and when it arrived the tomatoes were on it. She took it back and brought it back almost immediately. I saw the tomato seeds all over but I didn't feel like fighting since she made a snide comment about how she told me not to change anything. Like how rude is that? The side salad that paired with the sandwiches were lovely and my husband quite enjoyed his chips. We all shared the herb and sea salt fries and loved them. The sandwiches were good but the bread was greasy and wet which made it nearly impossible to eat without a fork and knife. We also split a nutter butter shake which was good but almost ruined by awful cool whip that took over the flavor of the peanut butter.   We were there for an hour and a half for 1 shake, 3 sandwiches, and a set of fries. That's just too long. Plus there were mistakes and the waitress was pretty off-putting. I don't know if I'd return if in the area.",

Quickly seated, we decided to indulge in one last gluttenous meal before the New Year.  We opted for a tasty craft beer and a Pratl's Burnt Almond Torte milkshake to share.  MMMmmm that milkshake may have been one of the best things I had in 2014... and it had alcohol in it :)  The guacamole and chips left us feeling \"meh\" since they were just kind of flavorless.  I opted for the Phat Patti's veggie burger since it sounded delightful.  What I got was mush.  My burger just crumbled apart into a pile on my plate.  The even if there flavor was there, it was just a mushy texture that left me wishing I ordered an actual burger.  Normally I'm a big veggie burger fan, but this left me disappointed.  Next time I visit Burgatory, I plan on ordering actual meat and a milkshake... mmm that milkshake :)",

    "text": "Holy burger.   I have been here twice and the food is well worth the trip.  First, the appetizer - a take on poutine.   Fries, gravy, cheese curds, with some rosemary braised short ribs.   Amazing.   Lots of meat  and just the right balance of herbs, salt, and cheese curd.   I ordered it both times even though I knew how big the burgers are.      Which brings me to the burgers.    The first one I had was the Meat Your Maker.   I wasn't sure about this one, but it was great.  The meat was tender and juicy, and the toppings were a nice tangy compliment.   My choice on the second trip was the Elk Gone Wild.  This one was also good, though definitely a little overpowered by the toppings.   The bacon onion jam was the main flavor in the dish.   Both were messy, so this is maybe not a first date kind of place.  Homemade chips on the side completed each dish.      Next time, I will try the milkshakes, which looked amazing.  Maybe split a burger to justify fitting that in.    Four stars instead of five because our server was in la-la land both times.  No personality, slow service, slow on the refills, didn't know the menu, etc.",

NoWait is incredibly useful at this place, although if you have more than 7 people in your party it won't work.  The wait for our table was about 20 minutes which was worth the wait.  I always do the create-your-own burgers at places like this and it doesn't disappoint.  I haven't done any of the non-beef patties, but if they're anything like the beef ones they're going to be good.  This is my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh for a reason.  The milkshakes, including the spiked ones, are also pretty good.  I got the burned almond torte one.  It's not quite the same as the actual cake, but it's a passable substitute.  It's also spiked, so the amaretto helps make up for any deficit.  This is a great place to go if you're at the Waterfront.  It took our group about an hour and a half from arriving and checking in with the host to leaving.  That's atypical for this place.  It's always packed so I would make sure to use NoWait to keep that wait time reasonable.",

    "text": "I left the city of Pittsburgh shortly after the opening of the first Burgatory. The concept intrigued, but I never had the opportunity to check it out. Since then, the burger spot has expanded into a sort of micro chain, which meant that their offerings tasted good enough to attract substantial clientele. A recent weekend trip to Pittsburgh provided a great chance to check out the newest location at the much more convenient Waterfront and see what the fuss was about.  Fortunately, my experience matched the hype I had heard of. We had a 25 minute wait during peak Saturday lunch hours, which was not bad considering the popularity of these restaurants. Our party started off with Burgatory's beer battered onion rings and jalapeno-bacon-cheddar fries as appetizers. The onion rings' enormous size reflected the beer batter's substantial flavor. Though a bit greasy, they are not to be missed. Ditto for the jalapeno-cheddar-bacon fries, which lost minor marks for flavorless cheddar.  The wealth of customizable burger options can leave one perplexed, so the less decisive/knowledgeable should order one of Burgatory's excellent house burgers. My companions' pot roast and steakhouse burgers both delivered tons of flavor. If you do feel like putting your name on your creation, use the menu for inspiration and veer off accordingly. I did so with my slightly overcooked yet still delicious elk burger, which provided a delicious combination of flavors that complemented a juicy, gamey patty.  We ended our meal on a sweet note with milkshakes to go. The salted caramel pretzel, with crunchy pretzel chunks for texture and a satisfying sweet-salty-toasty interplay, tasted the best of all the varieties we sampled. Burgatory also carries a respectable selection of craft brews and has an appealing cocktail program. All told, I won't hesitate to get stuck in Burgatory once more next time I'm in town.",

After he delivered our order we didn't see him until we finished our burgers.  This trip we did custom order burgers. The house sauce was very interesting. It was a subtle taste that was a highlight. The sauce is a combo of mayo, ketchup, molasses and cinnamon I think. The burgers were adequate but nothing to write home about. We both decided to substitute the deviled eggs potato salad for chips-a $1.50 up charge. I wouldn't have eaten it for free. It was made with undercooked fingerling potatoes and the taste of the potato salad was very bland. Neither of us ate it.  We might have tried something else but our server did not come back until we were all done and  ready for the check.  He was totally cool with taking it off the bill.  I know this place is convenient to the movie theater and people dig the shakes.  But this is just not a place I would recommend to anyone.",

We shared a seasonal pumpkin shake and a chocolate shake (forgot the name), both were excellent. Our server Jessica was super helpful and attentive. There was also a full range of college football on the multiple TVs. I had a crab cake burger with sriracha sauce. Very good with the right amount of crab and heat. My wife had a burger that she really liked. Another local chain with good food, atmosphere and service. We'll go again.",

I've been going for years now and have been to the original and majority of the offshoot locations. With that being said, this was my first trip to this location as I was seeing a movie next door.   We sat at the bar easily but it took 10-15 minutes to get service. We had 2 hours until our movie so figured we had plenty of time. Food came out about 1/2 hour after ordering. Fries were far overdone, the burger was the sloppiest assembled I've ever seen along with the cornbread and butter being cold. It took a few moments to get the waitresses attention but she eventually had a manager warm up the butter and cornbread. Everything just tasted slightly off that night. I couldn't put my finger on it but everyone else in the party agreed. It was a chore to get the attention of the waitress even for a refill and despite having my credit card on the bar top, it took 20 minutes or so to pay the check. Luckily we made our movie but with no time to spare.  Needless to say, this was my worst Burgatory experience. I'm hopeful that it was just an off night.",

The non alcoholic shake was meh.   Maybe it's because I'm not from Pennsylvania and have had burgers from at least 100 different places so I am probably just picky.   The reason for the extra star was the versatility of their meats - bison is very good- although again, they don't season or let it rest right I guess. Not sure what the issue is there.",

Our waiter was phenomenal. When told that we were all getting the Impossible Burger, he got so psyched! On top of that, he was very knowledgeable on cross contamination (with the chips) and the vegan alternatives available. He was also superb at recommending beers to my father & gramma!  The food was great. Really. The burger was cooked perfectly, there were vegan condiments and the sides were awesome. Oh - and the vegan milkshakes with alcohol. To die for. Thanks Burgatory for adding another vegan option to your menu! Keep on keeping on with those plant based goodies!!!",

Music that isn't too loud, TVs tuned to every sports channel, and good lighting all make for a very nice experience.  The menu is diverse if you're a burger lover.  Beef, chicken, and even bison and elk are all available.  I was very impressed with the freshness of my item when it came out.  Burger accompaniments are plentiful, and diverse, but in most cases you pay for each one.  The drink menu was well stocked too. Here again however, the cocktails are pricey averaging seven to $10 each.  The service is quite friendly, although there were times when I was left alone a little longer than I should've been.  Overall this is definitely a place I would come back to, even though it is a little overpriced.",

The estimated time was pretty much spot on - we got seated about 10 minutes before our 60 minute estimate, in fact.   The margharitas were delicious and we were off to a great start. The veggie burger however was simply mediocre. While they boast an extravagant medley of veggies, there's an overpowering flavor of horseradish which was quite distracting. The homemade chips were a nice touch however - crunchy and to the point.   Another thing that I can't not mention is the service. The server was particularly difficult and was really against any sort of customization or changes to the burgers on the menu. Any toppings could be removed (obviously), but she refused to swap them with any one of the host of ingredients they boast. Any toppings we did want to change she simply stated would be \"brought on the side\" which just didn't make any sense to us at all. It's really not that difficult to put onions on top of my burger rather than 2 rings being brought on a separate small plate. We thought this was quite ridiculous.   Overall while the drinks were good, the service and mediocre food left us wanting more. Wouldn't go back unless required in all honesty.",

The burgers are a bit pricey but definitely worth it! They're so filling and offer fresh ingredients that are well prepared. The chips on the side perfectly compliment the meal. I always customize my own burger and I love their unique options!  The staff is friendly and have my friend free chips when her burger came a little late. Be careful that there's usually a huge wait for dinner here and they don't take reservations!",

One gripe is that the Market Fresh Vegetables, which on that day meant sugar snap peas with red peppers, was too greasy and over priced for the amount offered.  I really want to give this place 5 stars but the wait times are ridiculous for a place that basically makes burgers with fancy toppings. I mean come on how long does it really take to cook a burger, 30-45 minute wait for take out? I don't think so. I really like Five Guys Burger and Fries.

The milkshakes deserve about 10 stars but I can't write a fair review on a burger place when the burgers are awful. I don't understand the hype about this place at all EXCEPT with regard to the milkshakes. I've tried a few but s'mores is my favorite!",

I got a ground chicken burger and topped it with gouda cheese, lots of veggies, and some chipotle mayo and it was delicious. The hamburger itself was to-die-for and I loved the fact that my burger came with homemade potato chips as well. My mom, who isn't really a burger person, also loved her meal. We will definitely be back again and next time I'm trying one of those delicious-looking alcoholic milkshakes! ;)",

Metal chairs that adult don't fit into properly make the two+ hours we were there very uncomfortable.  I got a basic delux burger on a GF bun.  (Awesome that that is an option). The burger was dry and tasted ok.  The fries were weird, they are small broken pieces and over seasoned.  Our waitress was awesome! The kids and other adults loved their milk shakes.  It wasn't horrible but for the price it could be much better.",

    "text": "Had lunch there today. First of all, the prices are outrageous. $14 for a burger with cheese, lettuce & tomatoes? That's the \"Meet Your Maker\" burger & the one I ordered. Oh you want fries? $1.50 extra for that. So $15.50 for a smallish burger & fries. My friend got the standard deluxe with fries. She asked for bacon & was told that they could bring bacon out on a side plate next to the burger but NO, they would not add the bacon onto the burger before serving it to her. That's some hipster nonsense right there. Whatever.  So first I get the wrong burger. As in, not the one I ordered. I send it back. I watch my friend eat 3/4 of her food before my correct burger comes out. I ordered it PINK. It came out EXTREMELY WELL DONE. This is like the TENTH TIME that I have attempted to order a pink burger & gotten one that was well done at Burgatory. I mean, it's literally a JOKE to me at this point. I wasn't even surprised that they overcooked it. My friend suggested I send it back AGAIN but at this point, she was done with her food & I wasn't waiting another 15 minutes. Oh and guess what else? Our buns were very stale. Nice & tough & crumbly. Yum.  The bill comes... nothing was comped. I wasn't expecting a free meal but maybe free french fries? Or $5 off the bill? Nothing.   Total price for two iced teas & two burgers with fries? $35. THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS. I tipped the waitress 20% on top of that, even though she messed up my order. So that brought it to $42.  If you want mediocre food not cooked to order, an attitude about adding bacon to your burger and to be price-gouged, then by all means, continue to patronize this overrated chain restaurant. Otherwise, SKIP IT.",

    "text": "Mmmmmm.....I drool like Homer Simpson thinking about doughnuts when the idea of Burgatory comes up; my second favorite burger joint of all time (Mario's East Side Saloon being the first). I usually like the DIY menu, but they have a house burger called the Farmer Brown (or something close) with ham and an egg on it that I LOVE, so I almost always get that.  Now, I really like Burgatory, but we usually go to the Water Works location, and the last couple times we have gone to the Water Front location. And I will say, I see a difference and I am partial to the Water Works location. It's not necessarily one thing or the other, just....something. Which is why it's only gets 4 stars; the Water Works location gets 5.  I ordered the Farmer Brown, pink, and it was perfect. The BF ordered a DIY, pink and his came out much more red. And another person who ordered their burger pink (another DIY) came out with absolutely no pink. Regardless of pinkness, everyone loved their food; the four person in our party had a DIY Chicken burger and liked it very much, but as with burgers there was some inconsistency. Everyone else got a salad or coleslaw, but being the French Fry lover I am, I got fries, which I enjoyed. The girls shared a milkshake and loved it, as always. They have very, very good milkshakes.  Our waitress was awesome. And all in all, a wonderful time was had by all.",

By the time my waiter came back after serving us our food i just wanted to leave. I paid a lot of money for a simple burger and really mediocre service. The milkshake was ok but people are ridiculous making a big deal out of it like jesus is behind the counter making them. It was a milkshake and it was OK. I'd feel better spending 1/4 the price for a larger one at Paige's down the road. Why? Because its a MILKSHAKE. Hopefully the other locations are better...",

Don't forget to get in line on NoWait (iPhone App) so that you don't have to wait as long get a table.

Good quality burger, and ingredients in general, but everything beyond that is kind of gimmicky. Lots of buzzwords and foodie sounding ingredients that don't add much.  I had the When Pigs Fry, which is a fried baby back rib.  Great texture and flavor - so tender, coming right off the bone but the Sriracha glaze is nothing special.   Had a burger as well, stuck with the beef. Had an egg and a couple other toppings on it. It was great, but once again the fancy BBQ sauce was good, but not great.   I'll happily go back again, and it's close to being amazing, but just misses what wound take it over the top.",

Drinks and milkshake (delicious) arrived promptly, but then things ground to a halt as we waited at least another half an hour for our food. There were some empty tables (although also people waiting), so it's not like they were packed. No one ever explained what took so long, though the waitress had an apologetic air when she finally delivered the burgers.   The burger itself was great. I ordered it \"pink\" and it was exactly that. The garlic mayo was pungent but that's how I like it. Others at the table were satisfied with their burgers too. I just wish we hadn't been so drained by the long wait and the overwhelming noise level -- by the time the food arrived, we were all eager to just eat and get out. If it's always that slow (I assume it's always that loud), I doubt I'd eat here again.",

The server was very nice.  The restaurant itself is smallish so expect a  wait at peak times. The decor is quite clever and has a some funny messages on the wall by the door.   We always get a different flavor of one of their fries as an appetizer.  This one was the one with the hot peppers. We were not disappointing.  For lunch we each had a burger off the standard list and did not create our own.  They were cooked right with a little pink and I got the wagu beef one and the wife had the barbque one.  Both were good as are the chips they come with.  All in all another home run for the burgatorians.  Really the whole experience from the service, food and decor was spot on.",

I've had two bad experiences here- the first time, our server completely ignored us most of the time. We had a 4 top and our drinks were empty for over half an hour with no one coming to check on us (and not at an overly busy time). Tonight, one friend and I came in at 8:30 to have dinner. Not a busy time, and again mostly ignored by the server. I ordered my food around 8:45 and said I had a takeout order I wanted to put in after my food comes out.. the server said I had to put it in right then because the kitchen closes at 10...in over an hour..for one to-go burger. Then, the staff openly talked about and laughed at my friend and I at the server station loud enough to hear, and mocked things I was saying. I have been a server for almost 6 years and am always extremely kind and understanding of wait staff. However, the staff here has crossed a line and even though their food is good, I will not return.",

The menu said extra napkins would be provided when ordered because of how messy it would get.  Water was empty for a while, and didn't get refilled till I asked the server as well.  I asked a question about what the menu meant by \"chips\" when you ordered the burger but she replied just \"regular chips.\"  In British standards I understood that meant american fries, but I was inquiring about whether it would home made chips or something you would buy at a grocery store.  FYI, it is home made.  If I knew, I would have gotten them instead of the upgrade to french fries.",

Also the house margarita and the cucumber cocktail are both delightful.  One downside though. The brioche bun is apparently made with pork lard according to a server, which was very helpful to the vegetarian in our party, that seems super ridiculous though from a baking standpoint. Brioche doesn't require lard it just requires an oil. Bit upsetting because it's far and away the best bun. I'm not a vegetarian so I still get it but it's a step down for those who are.  Also ... and this is kind of nitpicky, but the parking lot on the side is pretty small which is totally fine, the movie theater side has tons of parking ... I feel like employees should be parking on the movie theater side.",

The tomatoe slice on my burger was on the mushy tasteless side of meh, the lettuce was right there with it.  The fries were floppy dissappointments in the shape of fries.    Thank goodness I ordered the shake when I ordered the burger, because otherwise I would not have ordered anything further.  This shake almost made up for the disenchanting burger.  It was huge, tasty and perfect for two people.  Only one of us ate it.  I quaffed that thing down like someone had a gun to my head.  I think I scared my boyfriend a little there.",

    "text": "I'm guessing this is a Pittsburgh area chain as we saw one en-route here and then another within easy walking distance from our hotel in Homestead but had never heard of it before. The name intrigued us and since there was a veggie burger on the menu (actually two) and this is a must for me for a burger place, we decided to give it a try. Sports bar like atmosphere with two televisions with two different baseball games on. Fun signage adds to the atmosphere. Now for the burgers: two choices for veggie burgers. One is the Impossible Burger, which is geared toward meat lovers but since I am not a fan of \"meat like\" veggie burgers, I ordered the vegan option and it did not disappoint. Now here is where it can get overwhelming (but in a good way!) You can choose burgers from the menu OR you can build your own from a very large list of options from the bun, rub, sauce, cheeses, toppings, and sides. Chips are the standard side but there are other interesting options. I chose the Napa slaw which was a good accompaniment to the burger. Of course there are many meat burgers and my husband had the Fiddy Fiddy (half bacon and half ground beef) which he also customized. Be forewarned that it can get pricey when you start adding options (two custom burgers, two beers, one extra side plus tax and tip was $55). Was pleased to see Dogfish Head's Dragons and Yum Yums on draft and husband was happy to get their 60 minute IPA (in cans). Apparently their creative shakes are all the rage but we were so full after our burgers, we couldn't even think about it! Nice concept for a burger place and we enjoyed our meal!",

The variety of food is great enough that you aren't stuck ordering a burger, but they have so many options solely for burgers that why would you want anything else? The make-your-own-burger process is easy (and dare I say, fun) and their specialty burgers are clever, with the flavors all working well together. And the milkshakes are DELICIOUS! They are happy to make adjustments if you want to customize a little. The cocktails are good too - the strawberry basil shag is my favorite. Don't forget to check social media before you go to learn about the featured shake (this week's was carrot cake) and BOD (burger of the day; it was a breakfast themed burger today). I believe they have some good happy hour specials as well, but you'll have to double-check that.",

The restaurant was not very busy. We asked the hostess to seat a table of twelve, but more family members arrived after being seated. We then asked the hostess if we can add more tables to fit everyone. She looked at my aunts and uncles with a look of disdain. Another family member then rephrased the request to move more tables. She responded in a disrespectful tone saying \"I don't understand what you guys are saying or what you need.\"  My family was a large party, so I bet it was overwhelming. However, the hostess came off very rude and unwelcoming. She did not offer to help move additional tables or did not even attempt to understand what we were trying to convey. The looks she gave my family and tone of voice that she used was disheartening.   Besides that, food was great as usual.",

    "text": "Ambiance: Pretty typical bar-restaurant set up like Buffalo Wild Wings but with a nice dose of humor and character in their decorations. The booths are large, tables well-spaced and the place quite clean. Despite the high ceilings and large capacity I've never found myself yelling to be heard. The waits can be 45 mins or so during peak hours so it helps to call ahead or sit at the bar if your party is small enough. Service is a little on the scarce side but no major grievances the 4-5 times I've been here.  Food: When they do it right, the burgers can be amazing here. More often than not, our burgers have been perfectly medium rare like we ask and have been very juicy and tasty. They do use high quality meats and they offer a wide selection including bison and elk. If you don't like their pre-made burgers you can make your own however their form doesn't explain to you what the rubs like \"diablo dust\" or \"angel dust\" contain. Another complaint is there are almost no sweat-inducing spicy options even picking diablo dust, sriracha remoulade, and jalapenos from their toppings. The definitely specialize more in the savory department. In terms of the shakes, they're beautiful, incredibly rich, and velvety-thick. They can be quite sweet like Starbuck Fraps and are very large so be careful because you can fill up on them before your food arrives. My favorites are the coffee + donut and burnt almond torte. The frites are OK, some are crispy and some are soggy but they're still a step up from the plain chips that are standard with the burger. The only thing I would avoid are the side of beans as they were nothing but smoke and sweet which was a weird combination without some savoriness to bridge them.  Overall I love coming here for a good burger. It's definitely more gourmet than the Red Robin nearby and their shakes are unbeaten in the city. Give this local chain a try if you already haven't, just try to avoid the dinner rush if you can.",

I was given an estimate of 35 mins and when I walked in I was directed to the bar area, where the person attending the bar asked me to go stand near the 'B' sign and when the food is ready they would get it to me. I have been standing near the sign waiting for my food for almost 15 mins (20 mins after I ordered food..total wait time is 35 mins at this point) and had several staff pass by me just glancing and no one bothered to even ask me a question and everyone was goofing around or just busy cleaning up even though there were still customers eating and at least 40 mins to close the restaurant. I just lost interest in eating the food even though I love their burgers but too bad their customer service is hopeless. I would have understood if the restaurant was busy but half the restaurant was empty.",

Oh, and get the blue cheese fries because WOAH. I could just eat those little bad boys forever. They were so good even the kids liked them (this is a huge deal, you guys). We were so uncomfortabley full after our delicious, mouth-watering, delectable burgers, fries and chips - but, we were on vacation - so of course this didn't stop us from ordering shakes. Salted Caramel Pretzel shakes for the kids and I forget the exact name but some sort of hard shake with apples and bacon goodness for the man-friend and I. I was on the verge of explosion after this evening of pure, unadulterated gluttony and boy was it worth it. I HIGHLY recommend dining at this local chain, and if you live close, coming on a regular basis! So so so amazingly good. I wish we lived closer!",

    "text": "Burgatory is very good, but overpriced. It's overall worth a one time visit and financial splurge, but going there consistently and custom making your burgers is going to add up to about $15-20 (minimum) each visit. I'm not a burger person, so $15 for any burger is pricey for me, but maybe not to a burger affectionado. Their milkshakes are around $6 for non alcoholic and $8.50 for alcohol, although you can put alcohol in the non alcoholic and nix alcohol in the alcoholic shakes if desired. My favorite shake is the almond torte cake shake, although I would definitely order it without alcohol because the alcohol makes it much more filling and strong. It tastes just like an almond torte cake and your first taste is nothing short of mouth watering! I also had the smores shake, which I wouldn't order again due to it tasting dull compared to others. The apple pancakes and bacon shake is surprisingly good, but once again, I would nix the alcohol. And I wouldnt recommend a shake and a full dinner. I'm a big eater but even for me, it is just way too much for one sitting. *You will leave wishing you didn't overindulge, trust me! * You can take a non alcoholic shake home though, so that is an option for those of us who cant pound it down after eating a full meal. I usually order from their pre-selected menu choices because it is much cheaper than making a custom burger ($9.50-11). I last had the \"Potluck dinner\" which was a pulled pork sandwich and I was not impressed. The pork was dry, the bun was soggy and I was very disappointed by this. However, previously I ordered the \"Ying Yang chicken sandwich\" which was out of this world good! The field greens as a side is wonderful with the dressing they put on it. **You have to request fries otherwise you will get chips. The burger options are chicken, hormone free beef, bison, elk, veggie, dry aged wagyu and crab. I ordered bison, elk and wagyu and all were very good. The elk tasted slightly different from a regular beef burger, but the others didn't taste too exotic, so I would recommend any of those patties to people who aren't very adventurous with their food selections. Overall would recommend this place but be careful making a custom creation- they have so many wonderful choices but most of those choices come with a price!",

    "text": "I have been to the Waterworks Burgatory as well as the spot at Consol Arena and the food truck at Mario's Livingroom. I have enjoyed their burgers and shakes many times. So, when they opened in the Waterfront, I was very excited. As a Waterfront \"local\", I waited for a while before venturing over there. New restaurant openings there always attract a huge crowd. Today, my husband and I went there for lunch at noon. It was busy but the wait was only 10 minutes. I gave my cell number to the hostess and even though I got a text to see the hostess because my table was ready, it wasn't ready when I went inside. We had to wait for them to clear and wipe the table before being seated. My brother had recommended the Espresso Love shake. I've had their hard shakes before, so I ordered that shake and so did my husband. The tequila in the shakes were overpowering. Never before have I had a Burgatory hard shake where the alcohol was so overwhelming. Even the man at the table next to us made mention of the same thing. The waitress who took our order was very nice, but one guy brought us our shakes and a completely different guy brought us our meals. I hope they tip share because other than taking our order and taking away our empty plates and things, she did little else. The special burger of today was a chorizo burger with pulled pork on top. My husband ordered that and said it was the dryest thing he had ever tasted. He made comparisons to the Sahara and the Gobi when describing this  burger. I did a Create your Own burger. I ordered a beef  burger with provolone, mushrooms, pickles and a sweet onion rub on the beef. I have to cut most all sandwiches in half and when I cut this in half, it just oozed greasy. The bottom of the wheat bun was saturated with greasy juices. Also, their assembly of the burger goes against all conventional thinking which, in this case, was NOT a good thing. They put the cold pickles against the hot provolone cheese, then the lettuce and then put the sauteed mushrooms on top of the lettuce so they fell out all over the place. Whoever cleared this burger to be served was NOT paying attention or doesn't know what they are looking at as my mushrooms were all over the basket before I even laid eyes on my burger. The sea salt and herb fries needs to drop the herbs. They don't suit the fries and they don't suit beef. The flavors clash. I had to use a lot of ketchup to cover the herb flavor. I might come back here if i'm just going to have a short bite, but not for a full meal. I was sadly disappointed with Burgatory after all my great previous experiences with them. I know they will get my business when I go to a Pens game.",

I opted to build my own burger, as I was checking of my selections on the slip I was so surprised at all the options. They had things I have never even heard of ( maybe because I am not a heavy burger eater) and I decided to try some knew things. My partner and I had a blast picking out our orders, we ended up selecting a combination of things we never had before to be put on our burgers for the sake of being adventurous . When they brought them out they were huge! I was halfway expecting to get some crazy burger with a bunch nonsense inside of it that I would take two bites of and put down. That was not the case at all. My burger was delicious and so was my partners ( we took half of each others burgers to see who had a better one, I did). The staff was wonderful and very knowledgeable of the menu and did not mind are many questions. The decor is trendy and the vibe is pretty good as well. When you get your check they also give you little fortune cookies with funny meat-related sayings. I was very pleased with my experience.",

But my wife and I ate here today and halfway through our meal here we started feeling sick from all the grease. There were literally pools of grease underneath every burger, appetizer, chips, etc. The onion rings and the portobello fries especially were soaked, we only ate about one each of these, and I have never been known to moderate myself in front of a plate of fried items. We both built our own burgers and asked for them to be cooked medium. Mine came well done, hers came raw. I also ordered the Napa slaw, which was dry and bland but way too heavy on the black pepper (black pepper slaw?). The actual taste of the burgers was not bad, but we both left feeling pretty gross. **** Grossness alert ***** I actually went home and threw up and saw for the first time in my life an actual layer of grease/oil floating in the toilet. Ugh.   I will say the service was good and the dining environment was not bad, on the upscale side for a burger place. But you certainly pay for it too, prices were fairly steep for not so upscale burgers and apps.   Will not be coming back.",

The place wasn't at all crowded so she spent a good amount of time going over the menu with us and explaining all the different choices. She also made some recommendations but we ended up building our own burgers which was a little overwhelming. The black and gold shake was great. The burgers were perfectly cooked and we enjoyed being able to customize them. The fries were edible but not great. The housemade chips were awesome! Overall, we were happy with our meals and service but it is definitely a little pricy for a burger joint and after we ordered it seemed to take a while for the food to come out considering that there were only a few tables filled.",

As a burger reviewer, I have tried so many burgers in my life, nationally and internationally, as well as trying almost every major burger restaurant in Pittsburgh. Burgatory has just taken their burgers to the next level, making the best burger I have ever eaten in my life. I literally become addicted with their Morty's Steakhouse burger. The peppercorn crosted beef patty, medium cooked, makes me enjoy every bite. Honestly, whenever I feel like eating a burger, every other place seemed bad to me compared to Burgatory, so I'd rather spend my money on Burgatory, which is why I come here a lot. Not only their burgers are fantastic, but also their service is just so great. As a heavy Soda drinker, I always rate my server and determine the tip based on how many times I get my soda refilled without asking. With this concept, I would rate ALL their servers 5/5 because I have never came out of this place without drinking at least 3 cups without asking. In fact, they usually refill my cup before I even finish it. A combination of delicious food and great service is what this place all about.",

    "text": "Bad doesn't begin to describe dinner tonight. Our party of 11 arrived at 4:30. I'm writing my review at 7:06 and am just leaving. We made it very clear that we had tickets for a concert including a meet and greet before the show and needed to leave at 6:15. That's all we said. We didn't elaborate-   To sum up the experience. I'm hungry. Most of my group left because they went to see the meet and greet because my cousins the concert headliner. My meal was taken from me by someone clearing the table mid bite as I stayed behind and tried to eat. Missed the meet and greet-  and was charged for items we shouldn't have been. Not a good experience at Burgatory.  To add to just how terrible today was- it was a very special event. My cousin is a well know performer. He travels as a musician and is on the hit tv show, Nashville. Tonight we chose Burgatory to celebrate with before his concert. It was also my mothers birthday and another cousin in law just had a double mastectomy and ended chemo. We had a lot to be joyful about.   Burgatory pretty much crapped all over our joy and couldn't have cared less about our frustration with their lack of professionalism. Hey at least they consistent in their indifference in who you are.   I really can't express how pathetic the meal was tonight. I felt so bad for our server as she scrambled while our meals never arrived. 30 minutes after ordering about 3/5 of our food arrived. And the rest didn't come for another 20-25 more minutes.   As for food---   Having been to Burgatory many times before, and being the one who told me family it would be great, I ordered an item I've had multiple times previously. In the past I enjoyed a milkshake made with housemate vanilla ice cream, coffee beans, espresso, and chocolate. What I was served tonight was NASTY. Flavor wasn't existent. After a sip I asked the waitress to return the inedible item. I was told managements approval would be needed. To sum it up- I paid $9+ for a milkshake that tasted like paint varnish and wasn't consumed. If I had known my meal wouldn't arrive in a timely manner and then be cleared mid bite then I would have kept that milkshake since I had purchased it. I would have it so I wouldn't have been so hungry later.   My actual burger. I ordered a $15+ ground chicken burger. Which I would have enjoyed --except it arrived when the bill was being paid @ 6:40. Most of the party gave up on eating since they had to be elsewhere way before 6:40.. I was famished along with my 19 month old. Yes our Toddler was patient the entire disaster of a meal. We tried to stay to eat after the rest of the family had to rush to the show.  Well mid- bite, since most of our table left, the manager came over and cleared the remaining baskets. Including the one containing the burger I was in the middle of eating!  I was chewing. I looked down and my burger was swiped away!!! Bizarre!!!!   So to sum it up. My famous cousin came to his hometown and Burgatory crapped all over our big family night out before his concert. I think tonight will live in meals out that were the worst ever for as long time. Congratulations Burgatory for going above and beyond at being shockingly terrible! Wow. Just WOW!  *** I didn't describe the burger due to the lack of consumption.  I did eat a lot of fries. Salty.",

She also ordered a caramel pretzel shake. The rings were pretty great, bit otherwise tasty. Came with a horseradish sauce and ketchup. One complaint I consistently have with Burgatory - why do they ask how you want your burger cooked if they're not going to execute? Ordered pink, as I usually do. Often it'll come out like jerky. This time or was mooing on the way out. Red mush. Not good . Seems to be a total crapshoot - train your chefs to a standard and keep it! My friend seemed to like her wagyu burger, though had the same \"just off the hoof\" doneness. And she liked her shake. And our server was very nice and serviceable.   Think they may be expanding too fast - get your house in order before growing further.",

I didn't like their fries since they are usually more salty and less crispy. The beer selection is good and they do have some liquor and wines as well but not a whole lot. The usual stuff on tap. All in all, nothing too fancy and you can check it out if you're around the area but don't expect much from an average American chain restaurant.",

This burger earned a solid C, which isn't flunking ... but it wasn't \"so good.\" Sorry.  I came in wanting to slap the table with glee ... All the things that make a good restaurant good are here though! Didn't have to wait forever.  Wait staff was excellent ... they answered all of my trick questions.  Ambiance is great.  Appetizers were all spot-on.  Split a shake ... which was A+ good.  But the burger.  This is a burger place after all.  They won't grill it medium. I dunno ... if you use quality, fresh meat and make your patties in-house, you should be able to serve me a medium kinda bloody burger.  Disappointed.",

    "text": "When I moved to The Burgh Burgatory was one of the first restaurants I heard of. So as you can imagine they have been on my list ever since. I finally had the chance to try them a few weekends ago. I must state that I used the no wait app. It said there was no wait the entire 15 min it took to get there. However when I arrival I was told there would be a 15 min wait for a table.   We were seated by a window in the front of the place. Which is fine with me. I enjoy people watching and lateral rotation. Our waitress showed up about ten min later and asked for our drink orders. I already knew I wanted a hard shake. I went with the espresso love because coffee!!!  I really liked it. I wasn't expecting the little bits of crunch that I believe were chocolate covered coffee beans.   For my burger I had a hard time choosing. I ended up going with one off the menu instead of creating my own. I felt it was a better way to judge the quality of the place then making my own. I chose the Pot Luck burger and while I did really enjoy it I was a bit greasy. I also opted for fries instead of chips. I love the rosemary seasoning on the fries. It is one of my favorite herbs. However I found myself wishing the fries had a bit more of a crunch.   Overall service was slow and a bit lacking. Our waitress felt the need to explain every thing on the menu if there was even a question about one thing. I appreciated that but I'm also well aware of what smoked Gouda tastes like.   I have been to burger competitions and consider myself well versed in the burger department and while this wasn't the best burger I've ever had. It was was good.",

I'll stick to the Waterworks, where they have customer service in spades.    I don't care for bullet points in lieu of narrative, but the longer version goes a little something like this:  * Our party of 9 visited Burgatory this past Saturday for what was to be a celebratory pre-show birthday dinner before a 7pm show at The Improv.  * The birthday girl and beau arrived at 4:30pm (per Burgatory's recommendation) to put our name on the list.   * We were seated at approximately 6pm - not totally out of the realm of understanding, given that we were at a restaurant on a Saturday night that doesn't accept reservations.  * Our server wasn't rude, but I wouldn't call her \"nice\" either.  We gently mentioned to her that we were attempting to make a 7pm show and she said that wouldn't be a problem.  * It was a problem.  * We were approached once about drinks and had to seek her out to request a second round.  We would've had more given the opportunity.  * Seven of the nine of us received our food at 6:50pm.  The remaining two were told that their food was on its way.  It wasn't...anytime soon.  * It wasn't until a manager approached the table to apologize for the \"mistake\" that we even realized a mistake had been made. The server made no reference to this whatsoever.  The manager offered a complimentary side dish to each of the affected, which was appreciated.  * When our food finally arrived, it was INCREDIBLE. Many, many kudos to the culinary team for a series of meaty flavor explosions heard 'round the table and possibly, around the entire Waterfront.  * To recap - The server was nearly non-existent. Though she verbally recognized our request to complete dinner by 7pm she ignored it when it mattered, and never once apologized for the food issues or lack of attention to our timeframe.  I don't like her.  * The manager comped the burgers of the two who didn't receive their food with the rest of us. That's appreciated, but a bit too little, a bit too late.  * I'm sad.",

    "text": "I stopped by on Fri., 12/19 at around 5:15pm with a friend to claim my free birthday milkshake for being on the mailing list (if you're not on it and want a free milkshake on your birthday, sign up!) and to have a snack. I was a bit concerned that there'd be a lengthy wait, but I checked the NoWait app, and to my surprise, it said there was no wait (what?!?).  True enough, my friend and I were able to walk in and get seated right away.  When our waitress came, I inquired about a mint chocolate chip milkshake that I'd seen advertised as milkshake of the week a couple weeks before.  She said they were out of the materials to make it, which was a bummer, since mint chocolate chip is my absolute favorite type of ice cream.  The milkshake of the week for that week didn't interest me, since it involved coconut (I'm not a coconut aficionado), so I decided to order the choco taco milkshake (unspiked--since the free milkshake offer didn't include alcohol) off the regular menu.  My friend ordered the caramel pretzel milkshake for herself, and we ordered the chips and guacamole to split.  As expected, the milkshakes were ginormous and delicious.  They were infused with pieces of chocolate-dipped wafers and pretzels, requiring use of the spoon to eat them, in addition to the straw.  The flavors in both were delicious, with a nice sweet-salty balance.  My only criticism is that there was a lot of whipped cream, which made for a somewhat anticlimactic finish.  The chips and guacamole were pretty good, providing a salty counterbalance to the dominant sweetness of the milkshakes.  The guac had chunks of avocado, and the lime gave the flavor a nice citrusy pop.  While the red pepper pieces provided a pleasant color contrast (see photo), I avoided them, since I'm not a huge fan of raw peppers.  Overall, my friend and I had a good time at this Burgatory, despite just ordering snacks and milkshakes.  (See my review of the Waterworks Burgatory for my thoughts on the burgers.)  I'll have to return again soon to try a spiked shake (such as the burnt almont torte one!) and a burger at this location.",

    "text": "They have always been my favorite burger place in Pittsburgh since they reopened. I love all their burgers but one thing that is a most there for me is companying the burger with a milkshake. The milkshakes our awesome.   The Bison beef there makes a great burger but if you are not a Bison person then I would suggest the Dry Aged Wagyu beef for plan B. I love it that I can make my own combinations but the Meat your Makers and Buffalo Bison are also the most two favorite burgers on the menu. The burgers come with homemade chips. I'm personally not a fan of their chips. My fiance loves them but for me they are a little too cooked or maybe even burnt for chips. If you think you think like me ask for the fries. You can substitute the chips with homemade fries which I think its far better.  For the milkshakes I suggest the Caramelized Pretzel, Salted Nutella Crunch and the Campfire S'more. My personal favorite is the Caramelized Pretzel. You get the crunchiness of the pretzels with which it comes the saltiness and the caramel's sweetness. Its basically like a crunchy salted caramel ice-cream made into milkshake. So if you like that flavor you will appreciate the milkshake. And if you would rather your milkshake not to have any alcohol you can ask them to make it non-alcohol. They also make the non-alcohol options  hard shake if you would be interested.  The staff are generally good. I think they could do better ofcourse. But the waiting time is just ridiculous on weekends. So if you planning to have burgers with the family on a weekend try either to be there early or have something planned for the time. BUT, their estimates are more than huge over-estimates. It has happened to me a couple of times that they had told me we have to wait 30 or 45 minutes for a table and we decided to finally leave. But, they called us in less than 15 minutes while we had already left.",

Every week or so they have a special milkshake that is not on the menu. Those are hit or miss, you never know what the new special will be. Be warned the milkshakes are VERY ADDICTING!  Now that I've covered dessert first now on to the food. LOL Their veggie burgers are delicious. I would say probably the best veggie burger I've had. They make them onsite from scratch. The greatest thing is you can build your own burger from scratch. They give you a long list of toppings you can choose from to create your own burger. I like to pick different toppings each time. Their burgers are so huge, there's no way you'll be able to eat it all at one sitting. Also their fresh made potato chips are delicious.  You're truly missing out if you haven't eaten @ Burgatory. It doesn't really matter which one you eat at, I think they're all equally as good.",

Drinks were a little over-priced at $9 for a cocktail AND a beer, however I ordered the Strawberry Basil Shag and it was very good.   The party I was with all decided on customizing our own burgers- it took us awhile to decide and our waitress was very understanding and patient. I ended up getting the bison burger with the angel rub on the whole wheat bun. I added buffalo cheddar cheese, the truffled shallot aioli, arugula, pickles, and tomatoes. I also subbed out the chips for their french fries as instructed by one of the people in my party.   The burger and fries were delicious, but the bun fell apart very easily so I ended up eating it with a fork. Everyone at our table finished their entire plate easily so I was a little disappointed that our portion size wasn't a little larger.   The reason I am giving it a 4/5 opposed to a 5/5 was due to the price. $30 per person for a drink, burger, and fries was a little steep.",

    "text": "first let me start off by saying it is refreshing to think that a burger is not just a burger anymore.  Burgatory really puts the pow in an American staple.  my lovely wife and 5 young ladies and I went to the Burgatory down at the waterfront for lunch.  we were able to right in and the atmosphere and great.  even though it was winter we were in the patio section and it was quite toasty.  Our Serve was just wonderful Liz W was friendly and informative.  She answered all of our question and quite encouraging when it came to suggestions.    The girls all built there own burgers but stayed with the standard burger.  Every single person loved there meal.  I on the other hand, felt that is was my duty to try something new and different.  I like elk so I tried the Elk Gone Wild Burger.  Let me say it didn't disappoint.  First it had a Grass Fed Elk Burger with the Diablo Dust.  Topped with caramelized onion and bacon jam with a think slice smoked gouda.  With a vinaigrette tossed arugula.   The first bit surprised me.  The diablo dust did its trick.  along with the meaty taste of the Elk there was a punch of spice that filled my mouth.  the combination really when well together.  The unctuousness  of the meat and spice was mellowed by the smoked gouda.  Along with the Burger I had to have the Apple Pancake and Bacon Milkshake.  Yes I said apple pancake and bacon.  It was wonderful, you wouldn't expect to have chunks of bacon in a milkshake and it blend well with Ice-cream and milk,  let me tell you it really does.  You can get this wacky combination in a hard version but being that it was a lunch and i had 4 hours of driving to do i stayed with the non-alcoholic version.  I would highly recommend you try this restaurant, you will be surprised to find a burger is no long just a burger anymore,",

That is what we all did. Using a checklist at the table, patrons may select the type of bun, meat, rub, cheese, sauce, condiments, toppings and add-ons. \"Red, Pink, No Pink\" are the cooking options. My burger came out exactly as I ordered.  I've consumed many a burger over the decades, but this was undoubtedly one of the best.  Burgatory has a call-ahead list. I recommend it.

The burgers are good, and you choose what you desire for your burger, but they nickel and dime you to death for everything on it. 5 burgers, 5 milkshakes, should not have cost what it did. Ridiculously expensive for fries, burger and a shake. If I go back, I'll just get a milkshake. I could have fed my whole family for a week with what I paid that night.",

She was slow enough that my dining companion and I watched a table of 8 be seated after us... and leave about 15 min before we did.  Several times, we were looking for her and had to ask another server to help us, including after receiving the check and trying to pay. My burger wasn't just undercooked ( I like rare to medium rare), it was raw.  When I showed her, she commented that I may not have known what rare was- I assured her I did.., and especially the difference from raw.   My friend was given too much change- when she tried to explain to both the server and manager, it was like tracking calculus to a monkey- the monkey probably would catch on quicker. So much for trying to be honest.  No need for a return visit; the food is good, but certainly, there are many other places to get a good \"hand crafted\" burger... with much better service.",

    "text": "Went to dinner with a friend who is vegetarian so her choices are slim in the Waterfront. She really wanted to try the veggie burger and I decided to get a  vegetarian meal myself for a change!    She loved her veggie burger; though I must mention it does contain cashews for those with a nut allergy. Also, if you are vegetarian, do not opt for the brioche bun as our waiter said it contains pork fat - who knew? The waiter was very nice and helpful while she was trying to build her sandwich.  I decided on the psychedelic mushroom 'Hand' (sandwich), which is a marinated (a teeny bit spicy) portobello mushroom on a burger bun with roasted red peppers, lettuce, tomato, cheese, and a garlic mayo spread! It also came with a side of lightly dressed salad greens. It was excellent! Hands down the best choice I have made a Burgatory and I would highly recommend not only to vegetarians but those who want to skip the burger and go for something less heavy! It doesn't hurt that a portobello mushroom is actually quite meaty and thick so you really don't miss the burger.   The service was excellent and the price for 2 burgers and two drinks was less than $30- not bad for 2 large gourmet burgers with sides!   The only down side was that it wasn't busy when we came in, but since we were only 2 people, they stuck us at a tiny table that is extremely close to the table next to it so I had a hard time squeezing through the other side. I guess they set it up like that because it is a smaller space and they want to be able to seat a good bit of people but when another party sits next to you, you are basically right in their conversation and vice versa. I guess I should get used to it though as I have noticed a lot of modern restaurants doing this. It is a bit unfortunate because when I go out to eat I do want a smudge of privacy and freedom to talk about whatever.  If you haven't already, check this place out! Especially in the summer, where you can sit outside at a nice patio area!",

Expect about $10+ for the burger and another $1.50 for fries (burger comes with chips). Burgers have a good size patty and lots of options to building you own, although most premium toppings are $1-1.50, abundant choices of toppings. Lots of beer choices. Laid back vibe.  Lots of people having milk shakes, but after a burger with pretzel bun, I'm stuffed.  Service was great!  Fortune cookies served with the check...LOL! Hysterical! Seriously? Hahahaha!

Burgers are served with house-made crunchy chips and they have a ton of house-made dipping sauces.   Their entree salads are also very fresh and the portions are huge, served with house-made salad dressings. Don't even get me started on their shakes. Vegan milkshakes are now offered in vanilla, chocolate, and peanut butter, plus each week they feature a 'Shake of the Week'. Only thing is prices are pretty expensive.

Happy hour specials are also reasonable, but the drinks are a bit on the pricier end for a burger joint during non-HH.   I always eat my burgers without any spread (I have an aversion to most condiments) so most burgers tend to taste a bit dry to me. However, I think the patties at Burgatory are juicy enough to withstand the dry buns and veggies. Seasoning for the patty is always done correctly. The buns, however, could be a few days fresher, but I do like their wheat option.   Overall, Burgatory is a nice casual place for drinks and a decent burger.",

Nothing like having a cold elk burger that bun is soaked in grease. To make you love a restaurant. Being sarcastic! And don't blame all your problems on delivery partners make the burgers when the driver comes instead of letting them die in the window . Sincerely done wasting my money on over priced burgers",

Ordered the grass feed beef burger and it was very very very good.  I got salad as my side and it was yum!  Son had a made to order burger as well and loved it. Only reason I did not give this place a 5 is I wanted bottled or sparkling water and they did not have any.  Also my son had fries and they looked and tasted a bit greasy.  Ordered nachos to go - excellent!!   Easy access.  Great food!  Yum!  We are from out of town but we'll be back!",

    "text": "I've been to Burgatory quite a few times and it is one of my favorite places to grab a burger and a shake.   We were meeting some friends who already had a table when we arrived. When we sat down, the waitress came by and took our drink orders. She came back a little while later to take all of our food orders.   Anytime we come here, we usually do the custom burgers and make our own. I generally get the same thing (haha) and it wasn't as great this time. The burger didn't taste that good and I had very little fries. I was pretty disappointed since we don't have this restaurant back home and was excited to visit it since it's been a while.  Also, the waitress didn't keep up with our drinks as we had ordered additional beers that she forgot about. We also didn't have the chance to order shakes before she brought the bill out; so, I just said to forget it.   I'm certain I'll be visiting Burgatory again the future - probably just not this location.",

    "text": "So happy they finally opened this one, because I live so close to the Waterfront, and I love Burgatory. They let you build your own burger by filling out an order form, so it's easy to get things just the way you like it. They have a lot of \"burger\" options including elk, bison, wagyu, veggie, and crab burgers. I LOVE the veggie burger, which tastes a little like stovetop stuffing to me, but in a way that totally works. The burgers are always done right, and everything else on the menu was delicious. One of our lamer companions ordered a salad and it was very well done. The Gorgonzola and truffle aioli fries are TO DIE FOR. The shakes are also delicious. Know that you can order any of them with or without the booze, despite how they are listed on the menu.   Downsides: While the standard burger prices are pretty affordable, the extras on a custom burger can add up quickly, especially if you start off by opting for a different kind of meat. They only have three temperature options (red, pink, well-done), instead of the traditional 5, which I think is pretty unacceptable at a burger joint. The shakes and beer take \"expensive\" to a new level. You can't get a beer on tap for less than $6, and craft brews will set you back $8-$9. Shakes with alcohol cost even more.   All Burgatory locations--including this newest one--are pretty small, and because of its popularity, you're in for a wait on weekends. Worse than that, the kitchen doesn't seem to be able to keep up with this place. Both times I came here we waited a long time after ordering our food. Maybe this will smooth out over time, because I have not had this problem at other Burgatory locations. Overall, I highly recommend this place, as long as you are prepared to wait and keep track of what you order so the check doesn't come as a surprise.",

    "text": "I tried their location in Fox Chapel a couple of years ago and wasn't impressed, but I've been to the Homestead location twice and really enjoy it! I had the crabcake burger the first time--the crabcake was BIG, and messy, with coleslaw and Sriracha remolaude totally falling out everywhere. It was good, but I prefer the beef burgers. My recommendation is garlic mayo, arugula, farmhouse cheddar, and crispy onions, with the burger cooked medium. With their rosemary fries instead of the chips (which are good, but sort of superfluous compared to the fries). You can't go wrong!  Let's talk shakes. I like the idea of their creative shakes--with flavors like Prantl's burnt almond torte, smores, and coffe-and-doughnuts. But do there have to be giant chunks of pretzels/cake/chocolate in every single one? Last time I was there I had the mocha shake with coffee liqueur, which had huge pieces of chocolate-covered espresso beans in it. That's all well and good, but I don't really want to chew my milkshake, particularly when I'm tackling a giant burger alongside it. So while I give Burgatory the edge when it comes to the burgers themselves, I'm gonna have to cede the boozy-milkshake award to BRGR. They DO have a good beer selection here, though, so just have some hops and malts for dessert. :)  I've also tried the portobello steak fries, and I'm a sucker for portobellos so I enjoyed them. All the appetizers really need to be shared amongst a HUGE group, though, as that plus burger plus booze/ice cream/booze and ice cream is really too much to be handled by one mortal.",

It feels very industrious and it's a large space with a lot of variety in types of seating. It's usually really busy so you should use open table to reserve your name on their waiting list! It saves you a lot of time and grief.  I always 'make my own' burger and have always really enjoyed them. There are so many options and I feel like you really can't go wrong. The ingredients are super fresh and still so the next day if you have left overs. About that... they're pretty large! I get pretty full off of one half. They typically come with a side of chips, which also stay really crispy the next day.  Other than burgers, I've replaced my chips for fries a few times, and I've also tried their milkshakes and onion rings. The milkshakes are very very good! I've tried all except their chocolate one. My two favorite are the smore's one and the caramel pretzel one. And the onion rings are HUGE, like as big as my face! But they're good and filling.   There's a reason it's always so busy so if you're contemplating on going, you should definitely go!",

I ordered the potluck dinner burger which came with pot roast, cheddar, onion straws, and horseradish cream on a Kona crusted burger (supposedly a slight coffee crusting which I did not detect at all.) It came with their house made chips.   The burger had a good, natural flavor that actually stood up to the huge amount of toppings and various flavors. This was a good thing. The pot roast added little flavor but the sauce and cheese was good. The chips were average but you did get a lot of them as a side.   Overall the food was good but I did drop the rating due to the service. Our waitress at lunch had no idea what was on the menu. We asked a couple of questions since it was our first time there and she admitted she just started a few days ago and has never ate their. FYI to management, you have to train your staff! Have them sample the menu or at least be able to describe it!",

The custom menu makes it easy to get creative, and their regular menu has plenty to choose from as well. I have a dairy allergy but am not vegan whatsoever, so I love being able to get vegan cheese on a regular burger. The space fills up a little too quickly and the seating isn't as comfortable as it could be, bringing the rating down to four stars. I do wish they could expand to a larger location somehow...the Waterfront is an immense shopping complex and the ridiculously long wait times (even with that app!) are the biggest downfall.",

But from what I understand it's ludicrous to come here and not get a shake. So I was full. The food was good and tasty but we agreed that next time for the two of us we should share a meal rather than each having our own because the portions are pretty hefty. Plus, they're expensive. So I'll be back with a different strategy.  As a P.S. we used the OpenTable app to get a table since that's what they do and while the app said we were next in line and had one minute to wait, we ended up waiting about 5 extra minutes while other people were seated ahead of us, even though we checked in twice. So that could probably use some work.",

Big slices of portobello mushrooms in thick, heavy beer batter.

First, I got there at 9 o clock on a friday and the wait time was an hour and a half. That. Is. Crazy. Thankfully, there was a couple seats at the bar. Every time I've tried to stop at this location, there has been ungodly wait times. The one day, it was 3 and 1/2 hours.   Ordered my milkshake spiked, Carmel pretzel flavor. It took a half hour to come out. The shake itself was delicious. They are HUGE though and I easily filled up on just the shake alone. Our food took an obscene amount of time to come out, I know they were slammed. I ordered a build your own: bison meat-rare, horseradish cheddar cheese, BBQ rub, bacon, onion straws, BBQ sauce on a bun. If I was a 6 foot tall running back for the steelers, I maybe would have been able to finish it. It was room temp coming to the table, the tray was hot though. Sure sign it sat under the heat lamp for a while.  All in all, a little expensive but you get a ton of food. Wait times are insane. Get there on a weekday for lunch or after 10 at night. Food quality is good, pretty delicious.",

Beef (rare) on a whole wheat bun with a cracked peppercorn and sweet onion rub, cheddar, applewood smoked bacon, Dijon mayo, sliced tomato and organic field greens. Heaven. Paired it with their herbed chips and pear hard cider.   The place was crowded, the tables are close together, and it's a bit noisy but it's a burger joint so that's appropriate. Wait staff were attentive and fun. Looking forward to trying the Murrysville location.",

    "text": "It was a little loud for a Saturday pm, but when we asked the hostess to turn down the music, she did! She made a smart remark about it being a part of their thing or whatever to keep the music at an unhealthy decibel level but I really appreciate them doing that. It's nice to sit down to a meal and actually talk to other people. Though we notice many youngsters stare at their plastic palm pilots.    To the meat. Burgers were very good. One of us had a chicken breast sandwich instead. (Weirdo.) We also ordered onion rings which were very good but too expensive for what you received. We all substituted fries for chips and it was worth it. I am not sure where they get their beef but it isn't the best I've ever had. We get beef from our local butcher which is better, but they did a fine job with cooking it -- charred on the outside with a pink center, and they were generous with the toppings. No complaints, just happy chomping.    Service was decent. When we took our time ordering, we felt we were forgotten. But our server recovered. Our food came out quickly. No big deal. We left happy.   They have a good selection of beer, but it's way over-priced. I think I will try a shake instead next time or maybe I can sneak a carafe of white wine like my mom used to at Pizza Hut. She would ask for a cup of ice. To this day she will deny it.   For a party of three, our bill came to $75 including tip, but we also had 2 beers. Skip the alcohol and it seems reasonably priced for the quantity and quality.  Thanks again for turning down the music. We live in the age of Walkman's when everyone can deafen to their own tunes. Or next time I will bring my boom box.",

Also they often partner with other local businesses and bakeries to source fun ingredients for the milkshakes.",

    "text": "Burgatory makes one of the best burgers you can find in Pittsburgh. I began going to the original Aspinwall location about 3 years ago and have been in love with the food and  the brand ever since.   First of all the restaurant itself is a great atmosphere. The whole heaven/hell thing is very creative. I'm always entertained by the wall art.   The food is really incredible. They have about 8 or 10 signature burgers that are always on the menu as well as a Burger special that changes daily (if you want to find out what it is today just follow them on twitter). They also have an option to build your own burger. What I love about this is that Burgatory has a lot of unique toppings you won't find a lot of other places. But when I get a burger here a usually end up getting the Farmer Brown. I know they have so many unique and delicious options but there's just something about this classic burger with a gourmet twist I love so much! The only negative burger feedback I have is that I got a bison burger once and it was pretty dry. I imagine it's just a dryer meat, but I didn't like it so I wouldn't recommend that.  Even though you're probably going to Burgatory for burgers, they also have a lot of other great food as well. The pork belly sliders are incredible. I also really enjoy the fried mushroom appetizer.   Unfortunately I can't really comment too much on the milkshakes. I had one a few years ago and from what I remember it was great, but every time I come here I come for the food. I can't fill up on a milkshake!  If you live in Pittsburgh and haven't gone to Burgatory yet, you need to go. Don't let the long wait reviews scare you. Yes you could be \"waiting\" for up to an hour or 90 minutes. But because Burgatory uses NoWait, they'll take your phone number and text you when your table is ready. That way you can walk around all the great shops at the waterfront. Charming Charlie is right next door! I could spend an hour in there alone! Just make sure you put your name in before you're really hungry!",

Creativity and wit in every line on the menu, and genius in every bite.  It's hard not to make my review sound like an advertisement, but they really are that good.    Not only does Burgatory have tons of signature burgers that taste divine, you can \"Have it your way\" and they'll custom assemble any combo you can dream up.  The prices are fair for gourmet burgers and shakes.  I particularly recommend any of the signature house fries, the Onion Rings, and the  \"Bangkok Fries\": massive juicy portabello mushroom strips, beer battered, and brought out stacked in a log cabin with a spicy dipping sauce.  My only complaint is it's so good, that despite the ample seating, there tends to be a wait.  Expect 20-40 minutes on a normal day, up to as much as 3 hours on a busy Saturday night.  Given how many other restaurants are within a few hundred feet, it's very telling that people will wait here for over an hour, rather than eat somewhere else.  That's what happens when you offer delicious, innovative food, with good service, and fair prices.  I hope more other restaurant owners take note and follow Burgatory's lead!",

My husband and I enjoy checking out Burgatory as a Sunday brunch spot b/f running errands. The beer selection has something for everyone, and their bloody marys get the job done. I've had both burgers from their menu and have built my own. The one quibble I have about the build-your-own \"menu\" is that I have no clue what some of the rubs consist of. Sure, Memphis BBQ is obvious, but Angel Dust and Diablo Dust, what flavors are those? But, like I said it's a quibble. Overall a solid choice and maybe because we've only ever been a party of two, have never had to wait for a table, always a plus!",

    "text": "First, before I delve into this review, I'm a huge fan of and am sure to tell other people of Burgatory.  Which is why it is so hard to write this review.  This was not my first visit here, it was my second.  The first visit I made here ended up with me turning right around and walking away.  It was so crowded (on a Tuesday night) that I just didn't even want to deal with the crowd.  Funny thing is with this new location, instead of expanding it in any direction, it's still the same size as when the other restaurants that failed in this spot.  Now onto my most recent visit.  We showed up and there was a bit of a wait.  After giving our name to the hostess, we ventured over to the bar.  While at the bar, we decided to sit at the bar and have our experience of the place instead of sitting at a table (had to go back to the hostess to have our name removed from the wait list).  We both ordered some drinks, a fairly decent list of IPAs on draft and we put in for an appetizer.  The truffled Gorgonzola fries were pretty amazing.  When we ordered the burgers, that's when it went downhill for me.  I opted for the make your own burger.  After scribbling and rewriting we had our orders down.  Handed them over to the bartender and just had to wait.  I had ordered my burger topless (just the bottom of the bun).  When the burger arrived everything that my eyes could see at the time looked perfect.  Whenever I cut into this delicious display of beefiness, that when I got to see what was underneath.  The bun was soggy, not the type of soggy that you get from the juices of the burger, or the wetness of the fresh vegetables, but soggy in the pink kind of way.  I was a little concerned about this and informed the bartender I would not be eating this.  While I give him credit for trying to explain to me that the pinkness to my bun was just the juices running of the burger patty, I had to disagree with him.  Mind you, I ordered my burger cooked to medium well, if there were any juices from the burger they sure as hell would not be pink.  There was no smell to it either, so it could not have been a dressing for a salad.  After a trip to the kitchen the bartender came back out to me and said that the cook said that's how they cook.  I'm sorry, but that doesn't make me want to eat the burger any more than the fact that I can see with my own eyes that the bun portion was pink.  In the end, they offered to make me another burger (I assumed it would have been free, but wasn't).  I opted to have it to go, good thing I did, by the time all this was over and the burger was ready my friend had finished her meal.  The manager came over as well and apologized to me for the mistake made and after handing me my bag with my new burger in it, she also handed a coupon thing for a free milkshake the next time I visit (thanks a million for that, giving me a coupon for something free that I cannot not use because of a food related allergy).  To sum it all up, even though this place is literally like ten minutes from my house, I'll stick to the original spot and not take my chances again.",

I chose to build my own burger and they forgot one of the toppings I requested...they offered to make it right away but why should I have to wait an additional amount of time...then the toppings were very sparing...there was like 5 pieces of the grilled onions, two of spinach....so sad..the burger was cooked well which is nice...the brioche bun must not be their most popular because it was losing its crust which is a good indication that it was going stale...the house made chips were burnt and therefore bitter...all in all a sad trip to what could have been a cool place.",

All of them were done to perfection and tasted fantastic.  Where they seemed to have real issues was with everything that was deep fried.  The onion rings would have had a great flavor but it was masked by the excessive grease left over from the deep frier - not worth the $ 7.50 we were charged given the poor quality!  The Chipotle-horseradish sour cream dipping sauce was very good but not good enough to warrant the $ 0.75 we were charged for an additional side portion.  The fires were limp and served colder then they should have been and their chips were over cooked and very greasy - possible issues with their deep frier temperature...  There was a $ 1.50 up charge to substitute the fries for their chips  - what a waste of $ 3.00 on the up charges!  The Caramel - Pretzel milkshake was very good but slightly more expensive than what I thought it should have been.  To recap, have one of their great burgers with a treat of a milkshake but skip the chips and fries.",

We usually like to make our own burgers. That's a fun option. The milk shakes are fantastic... But getting them everytime might be too much! I have to include the fact that the atmosphere is loud!! We actually asked for the music to be turned down. We were told it if set by the owners, not management. That was weird. Had to hear each other while waiting for our table.. We didn't want to ask about that after the music thing. Our food came out quickly and hot.   It was also really cold. So bring a jacket I'm going to stop typing now.... My fingers a numb.",

    "text": "I visited Burgatory yesterday as a first time patron. I was with a group of five. I would describe this place as extreme hit or miss.  My partner ordered the Fluffernutterbutter Milkshake - it was so incredibly delicious. One of my friends ordered a Blueberry Pancake Milkshake which was the special flavor of the day. The Blueberry Pancake Milkshake was disgusting. Everyone at the table tried it and everyone's reaction was EWWW. Also he ordered it without whipped cream and it was served with whipped cream, lots of whipped cream. The server that brought it out didn't take it back. And the regular server for the table never brought out another one.  The menu is overly complicated. It wasn't clear which things were entrees and which things were appetizers. Overall the food was greasy. It wasn't bad but it wasn't anything that I would want to eat again. I ordered a chicken burger on pretzel roll and it kept slipping out of my hands because the bun was greasy. One person in the group ordered an appetizer and told the waitress that he is allergic to onions and the appetizer was served with chopped onions as a topping. We re-read the menu description and it didn't mention onions as an ingredient or topping.  The restaurant is clean. The bathrooms are clean. Lots of parking. The waitress was very friendly but she didn't seem to know much about the food that she was serving or cuisine in general. She had no idea what the daily specials were when we were ordering. We asked her and she had to go find someone to ask what the daily specials were. Unfortunately being very friendly doesn't make up for not so great service.  I would strongly recommend the Fluffernutterbutter Milkshake from Burgatory, and that is all. Go somewhere else for burgers.",

Everything I have ever had has been amazing.  You have to get a milkshake if you come here.  My wife and I usually get them to go so we can still finish our meals.  My favorite is the caramel pretzel milkshake.  It is the best milkshake I've ever had.  Each drink has pieces of pretzel in it.    The portion sizes are large so no appetizer is needed.  The Morty's Steakhouse burger and the Meat Your Maker burger are my two favorites.  They are up there with the best burgers in the city.  Flavors blend together perfectly.  I order my burgers medium rare and they are always cooked to perfection here.  Update: I felt I had to update my review after having the Impossible Burger.  This had been on my list of things I wanted to have for awhile and I am so happy I tried it.  Everything from the flavor to the texture was eerily similar to a regular beef burger.  The toppings the put on it were also a great compliment.  Next time I am here I want to try it with some different toppings/buns, but I will definitely have the impossible burger again.",

Me, my boyfriend, and our friend left together and we drove up to the comedy club, where our friend had to get out to puke. Then he drives us to our house and my stomach starts to hurt, I look at my friend who is in a cold sweat... I'd seen that look before, yup... he had to Poo and so did I, I run upstairs to use the bathroom, not but two minutes later my boyfriend is frantically knocking on the door, he also had to poo. Not good when you only have one bathroom.  All in all, I have no idea what happened.  My milkshake was good, however I did leave it in my friend's car because I had to poo and he had to rush home to poo as well.  If you go to this location make sure you have multiple bathrooms. The milkshake: 3 stars  The bathroom trip: a solid 1 star experience.  That's all, have a nice day.",

I had an Elk Burger very under cooked and cooked with a spice blend I didn't request or on a spot that hadn't been cleaned from using the spice on a previous burger. Instantly started causing me problems, and I eat jalapenos all the time. I'm from Phoenix.  It completely ruined the meal. Of course it also had the wrong onions, a soggy lower bun from sitting to long on it before coming out. The NAPA slaw was all potatoes. Not one piece of cabbage. Though it wasn't bad, it wasn't what I asked for. I've spent the last 6 hours with the worst indigestion I've had in over a year. Even Kao hasn't stopped the burn. Try any place else for a better more reasonably priced burger.",

Whoever was cooking the burgers that day needs to learn how to properly prepare a traditional burger and an Impossible burger. It seems like they pressed on the burgers as hard as they could while they were cooking, so the burgers were hard with an outer crust. BURGERS ARE NOT SUPPOSED TO HAVE A CRUST. If you know about Impossible burgers (which the griller clearly does not), you're not supposed to press as hard as you can on them while they're cooking. It over cooks them, and creates a hard crust on them. I specifically asked for it to be pink, and directions were not followed. This isn't the first time it's happened - this has happened twice before. My boyfriend also ordered a burger well done, and it was over cooked and inedible.   I think I'm steering clear of Burgatory going forward.",

The patty tasted like thanksgiving stuffing (no idea why) and was not completely hot. I almost considered sending it back but ate it anyway. There was a tiny amount of guac, one leaf of lettuce, two thin slices of tomato and a TON of the rub. The combo of my fries and sandwich were almost too salty to eat. It was edible, but just not great. The chips my friend got looked worse than my fries but I didn't bother tasting them due to being too loaded up on salt. The burger itself was really filling and also surprisingly spicy. They should mention that on the menu. They should actually explain a lot on the menu. I ended up asking the poor server a lot of questions (like what the heck is angel dust besides a drug..). I get nearly the same sandwich at Sheetz and that is far better quality than here.",

We liked that they can make any shake with the non-dairy ice cream. We certainly could not tell the difference.   Service was good. Our server was pleasant but it took 30 minutes to get our food. The wait wasn't horrible but long enough that we noticed. Portion sizes were good and prices very reasonable.   Burgatory is a good option in a somewhat saturated market,",

    "text": "Summary: Upscale Burgers, Fun Atmosphere. Let's go somewhere else.  This review applies to several Burgatory locations, not just this one.  The Goods: - Tasty burgers. Create your own! - Booze in the milkshakes. - Friendly, casual service staff. - Fun, casual atmosphere.  - TVs not in the dining area, but near the bar. So take your dose of distraction there. - My beer-loving friends like the choices.  The Bads: - Burgers are too salty - every one I've had (and I am a salt lover). But if you tell them not to season the patty, it's tolerable (at least the one where I asked for that). - The potato-based sides are too salty. The sweet and russet potato chips are a nice touch, but got old fast. The fries: meh. - A bit pricy, even for an upscale burger joint.  The Uglies: - I've never been in a Burgatory without at least an hour wait, even at 2 PM in the afternoon. Not sure it's worth that.  Bottom line: I go if my compadres want to go. But I don't seek it out.",

Wide variety of food and the milkshakes are to die for. The customer service was exceptional and our waitress was very attentive to us. The only reason I'm not giving them a five star rating is because of the miscalculated wait time in game day-we waited for 2hrs but was told an hour and fifteen minutes would be our wait time.

    "text": "This is a terribly over-rated burger joint. we waited almost two hours for a table. When we were seated near the window it was cold as the garage like window had leaks and was not insulated. Our waiter was surly and kept trying to rush us to order. When we did order he did not write the order down. Sure enough, he forgot to add bacon to my standard burger. In addition, the burger had a quarter wedge of lettuce on it, twice the size of the undercooked, average tasting, burger. When I asked for my bacon burger he was supposed to bring me, his solution was to bring me a plate of 4 pieces of old, cold, chewy bacon. He took so long to bring it, I was mostly done with my burger when it arrived. We ordered the espresso alcoholic shake and a chocolate eclair shake. They tasted exactly the same. Like frozen cream, not much flavor. Way too many chocolate shavings for a shake. We also ordered the worst onion rings I have ever received at a restaurant. They were soaked in grease, way too big, with the worst part of the onion as the center. They would not break as you bit in. Spewing oil as the coating crumbled off in a greasy pile.  Go to Wendy's. You will spend less than half the money and get a much better hamburger.",

    "text": "I love Burgatory.  I mainly love Burgatory because they make TRUFFLE GORGONZOLA FRIES!!!!!! Truffle Fries. Truffle Fries with delicious cheese. ohmahgawd. My mouth is watering as I write this.   Their fries are probably my favorite fries EVER. I typically come for happy hour when the fries are half off, but if I order a burger I get chips AND add an order of truffle gorgonzola fries. FYI: The chips and fries reheat well in the toaster oven/oven, so if you need to get both you can finish them during your next meal.   Happy hour at Burgatory is pretty good and includes half off apps, some $5 cocktails, and (I think) $2 off drafts (but I can't entirely remember and can't find a menu/info about it ANYWHERE.)  I've also had different versions of the veggie burger and the crab patty. Every burger/sandwich thing has been good. And the milkshakes..... The milkshakes, spiked or otherwise, deserve their spot on so many different \"Best Milkshake\" lists. My favorite is the Salted Nutella Crunch with some kind of alcohol added.   The reasons my review isn't five stars? The wait time can be insane if you don't put yourself on the reservation/waitlist and some of the other apps I've had have not been good. I've brought people to Burgatory before and everyone has agreed that the truffle fries are magnificent, but some have been disappointed with some of the other starters we shared.",

    "text": "We tried to dine at this Burgatory location with some friends once before and left after being told that there would be a 45 minute wait (one of our companions has lupus and needed to take her medication with food ASAP), which condemned us to a dismal meal at nearby P.F. Chang's. Months later, however, after much filibustering, I convinced my darling Kay to try this Burgatory once more.   And yet again, as if it had been an amusement park ride, Kay and I waited for 45 minutes, burning the spare 3/4 of an hour at Barnes & Noble. The mounting anticipation contributed to the overall experience favorably, making the standard dine-out night seem a little more special, particularly when it's assumed that the food will be superb, and it was, it was.  Burgers are no longer lowbrow or taken for granted. Restaurants such as Burgatory have taken something that the public had gotten bored with and transformed it into something exciting, fun, and novel again.   Burgatory veterans know the process for a Custom Creation: Grab the tiny pencils, go over all of your options (type of meat, bun, toppings, cheese, etc.) check off the boxes on the form as carefully as one would take a standardized test, and hand it in to your server, who in our case was efficient, honest ('it's just 1,000 Island, hon' she said of their 'house sauce'...), witty, and a ray of light overall. Your burger will come to your table bearing a flag with your name on it. Aren't you exceptional?  Or you can pick a standard build (there are 10) if you want to go into autopilot like I did. Hey, sometimes ya just want to trust your chefs, y'know? Besides, how much can one play around with fixings? It gets tedious trying to figure out what will go well with what and all. Nah, this time I put myself in the Devil's hands and chose the Meat Your Maker burger.   MYM is composed of a dry aged Wagyu patty, a sweet onion crust, Gruyere, roasted tomatoes, organic field greens, and  truffled shallot aioli. The fragrant, silky, medium-rare (a must!) beef was only augmented by the sweet rub, and the creamy,  ribald, brackish aged cape of cheese. The roasted tomatoes added a touch more sugar as did the aioli, which grounded the entirety of the Brioche-encased burger via that earthy, elusive minced fungus.   The fries that flanked the burger were up to the usual crispy, fluffy standards I've come to expect from Burgatory. The days of the once-fried tater are dwindling, Burgatory helping to continue this positive trend of proper cookery.  Like debating whether or not Captain America could take Batman, local bon viviants have been arguing over whether Burgatory or BRGR holds the Big Gold Belt. While I feel their burgers are about equal, Burgatory does trump BRGR in terms of milkshakes. BRGR offers a fine milkshake for a summer evening. Burgatory offers an ornate milkshake for the ages. For instance, my Campfire S'mores milkshake too the stuff of Boy Scout weekend getaways and elevated it into an event of pure indulgence. The marshmallow was imperious, charred, gooey. The alabaster quagmire of whipped cream was luscious enough to frost a wedding cake. The graham cracker crumbs were there as were the pieces of chocolate candy bar. The ice cream itself was almost too thick, like quicksand, but that only helped the boba straw to prove useful and gave me an excuse to savor the frozen dessert, take my time, allow it to melt as I dismantled the garnishes. A Burgatory shake isn't to be sucked down as you stroll the Waterworks mall. It is to be treated as an opulent affair --- a Baked Alaska in a glass.   Burgatory keeps growing and still apparently can't outrace the demand for their products. No matter when you visit one, the swanky, eye-catching interiors are brimming with laughing patrons even without having to await a table. I could express concern that Burgatory will spread itself too thin and lose something in the process,but it just hasn't happened yet. Each new franchise has been nothing but a boon to its part of town and has stood alone in areas infested with national chains.   In other words, there is now a concrete reason to drive out to The Waterfront, and it ain't to see a movie or play games at Dave & Busters.",

    "text": "This location is a genius one, because there is a certain lack of good restaurants in the Waterfront area (many are chains or just mediocre...). Also, it's so much closer than the one at Waterworks or in Robinson. In any case, the wait is a bit long as usual, but the ambiance and overall setup is great. Not too loud, but still a pretty fun atmosphere. I like that they offer all sorts of exotic meats from elk to bison, and perhaps I will try those in the future. This time I went with a custom burger with the usual beef patty, and it was pretty cool to be able to choose everything from the topics to the sauce to the rub.   The burger was done pretty beautifully, not too much stuff dripping out and not at all falling apart as it was eaten. At the same time, there was definitely a lot of flavor, and the amount of toppings (4 for me) was just right. Not only that, but their chips and fries definitely sealed the deal (especially because a side comes by default instead of being extra). Crispy and savory they were, with the latter having been seasoned generously with dill, which was pretty neat. Overall, definitely one of the better burgers all around.",

Lots of unique combinations and variations of ingredients.  3. Weekly special burgers and shakes 4. Great service.  5. Food is always consistent.  6. Create your own creation options for those who have very specific burger needs.  7. Cooked to perfection they ask you how you prefer your burger.",

The inside of this place is quite dark... unless you're sitting by the windows, the lights can be pretty dim.  Husband and I ordered a regular burger (comes with chips) and WTF chicken sandwich (comes with a side salad) and both were very delicious!  The mustard and mayo in the chicken sandwich were spot on, and the dressing on the salad was delicious (balsamic).  What's really interesting is that they give you fortune cookies after your meal! Lol My fortune was \"You will be in a food coma soon\" - which was True :D  The service was great, but it took about 40 minutes for us to get our food (from the time we ordered). I know it's probably because it was a holiday, but still felt like a long wait!",

The burger was incredible (pun intended). The chips were mouthwatering and crispy. I also thoroughly enjoyed the PBR hard coffee. Excellent experience and I'd recommend it and will come back!",

The food came out and looked and smelled delicious. We had the build a burger, the deluxe, the one with peanut butter and jelly, and another one that was a classic. Their toppings are fresh and they have a wide variety,but I'm not sold on the meat that is suppose to be grass fed and hormone free. Two burgers had regular beef, that we asked to be cooked pink. So, the place has a scale of red-pink-no pink.... not rare- medium- medium well... you get the idea. We ordered pink on both to make sure they were juicy.... they came well done. We ordered the beef and bacon as the other meat. So, this is not what you'd think. Ground beef with cooked bacon pieces in the beef patty. Nooooooooo! It's beef and pork... I'm thinking Canadian bacon and beef grinded together and cooked.... it was a super fat burger. We were not happy didn't feel that yummy burger experience we wanted...and my daughter threw it all up when we got home",

I wanted it to be juicier but I wasn't sure if it was because my burger was over cooked or if it's because the Impossible Burger can't get pink. I read that they changed the formula so it could even be bloody. I also got my burger with \"angel dust\" which is salt, pepper and garlic. I might skip this the next time because my burger was quite salty. My husband had the Wagyu Beef and I had a bite. Other than it being grilled, it was quite tasty. I prefer a fried burger. We also shared the Almond Cake Shake. So yummy. I would definitely go back to Burgatory. Tasty food, nice vibe and decor and good service.",

I was so stuffed that I djd not get a milkshake on this visit but I have had one before and was not disappointed.  We did have to wait a half hour for a table but we just went shopping and they called us when our table was ready.

I like their build-your-own burger model, but it can get expensive fast if you don't pay attention to how much you're adding onto your burger. The chips that they come with are fine but I recommend upgrading to something else, like fries. I deducted a star only because it's a little expensive for what you get.  Burgatory is one of the few places in Pittsburgh that you can get the impossible burger, aka the best veggie burger out there by far if you're looking for something that really imitates meat. They recently changed the recipe, which is good because the old patty used to fall apart like crazy. A milkshake with your meal is a MUST! I love that they give you the extra milkshake in the blender cup. They have weekly specials, but my favorite of all time is the fluffer nutter butter shake. Its like a peanut butter and fluff sandwich (my favorite food as a kid--yes, I still have a huge sweet tooth)! Overall, Burgatory is a great place to go with a group of people, because everyone will find something that they like.",

    "text": "I love the other Burgatory restaurants in the area and was excited to see one coming to a closer area to my home. I  was a regular at the Waterfront until it got old and stale, now Burgatory gives me a reason to go here again.  The new Burgatory is small. That said, I expected a long wait Sunday, the day after the grand opening. Getting there around five, I was seated at 6:17. There was no room at the bar, so we went across the street to a somewhat empty Bar Louie.   New restaurant, you expect issues, slow service, getting drinks right, billing issues. Surprisingly, there were no issues like that. My portabello mushroom cap on a whole grain burger bun, with radicchio, grilled onions, angel dust, mushrooms and garlic aioli was perfect, the side salad was fresh and delicious. The only issue I ran into was the fact the waiter didn't know if that had fat free ice cream or fat free yogurt to make an adult milkshake. This was no problem, I settled for water with lime. Who needs the extra calories? Kudos for Burgatory for having a properly trained staff for a grand opening!   One problem I see here, and it's been a problem at the waterfront for years.... PARKING. This is why I gave it only three stars. There were no issues with the food or overall service. The burgatory will be competing for parking spots not only with Bar Louie, the theater, Bravo's but also with the other shops and the Starbucks. No restaurant in this location before Burgatory has had any luck, I wish Burgatory well and hope they break the string of bad luck this location has had.",

    "text": "Was in the mood for a burger tonight so I thought I'd check out Burgatory. I was at the one in Robinson about a year ago and was very impressed with the burger I got there. My only mistake was that I got a little carried away with all of the options and my burger was so tall I had trouble stuffing it into my mouth. I made it a point not to do that this time around.  I sat at the bar and was offered a draft list. There are twelve different craft beers to choose from and the twelve they decided to offer on tap are all excellent selections in my opinion. I was surprised I've waited this long to stop down here.  Looking around I noticed that there are 9 TV sets offering a view of the game to everyone who chose to sit in the bar area. The dinning area offers roomy booths and a few tables in the middle without generating a cramped in feeling.  My burger was served in about ten minutes and it was cooked to perfection. Very tasty! The bacon I opted for was thick and not like the cheap stuff you'll get at a fast food burger joint.   The service is friendly, the atmosphere is contemporary, they have a good beer selection and my burger was great tasting. Although they're a bit more expensive than I think a burger should be, Burgatory really does get burgers right",

I've had veggie burgers from a lot of places and this one is at the bottom of the list. The great service and the milkshake kind of made up for it. I didn't think it was pricey either. Paid about twenty dollars for a milkshake and a meal. Would I go back again? Probably not but I most definitely enjoyed checking this place out. My friends were right \"Why go to a burger place if you don't eat burgers?\"",

My niece had Burbon BBQ sauce with Poblano Peppers and lived hers as well.  Of course you can't leave unless you have a shake or take one with you. I had the Nutella Shake and my niece had the Caramel Pretzel shake. This may not be an icecream joint but their shakes are the best I've ever had. They even have \"adult\" shakes that include liquor.  The servers are wonderful. The whole vibe if the place is upbeat.",

My husband and I came here for a late night snack on Wednesday night, less than 2 weeks after they opened their doors for the first time. Since we've dined at the Robinson and Waterworks locations at least 8-10 times, we knew exactly what we wanted. However, I was surprised that service was initially quite slow. We were seated for 10 minutes before our waitress came over. She was extremely apologetic but told us that she needed to take another table's order and would be back as soon as possible. Even though placing our order took some time, our food did arrive promptly after we ordered.  I have given the other Burgatory locations 5 stars but can only rate this location 4 stars for now. Like the other locations, the food is delicious. I enjoyed some Truffled Gorgonzola Fries with a Salted Nutella Crunch Milkshake mixed up with Chocolate Vodka. Yum yum yum! The restaurant is also very well decorated, and this location feels more open than the other two, which I really like. However, the rating difference was the service. The waitresses that have helped us in other locations have all seemed very experienced and polished. The waitress that served us on Wednesday night was very sweet and apologetic about the meal's initial hiccups... but she was just very young and inexperienced.   I will definitely be back - especially since I live less than 15 minutes away - but do hope that the service improves in the future.",

My boyfriend always gets a make your own beef burger and a side of baked beans. He loves both- the beans are a little spicy but some of  his favorite. We've also ordered the nachos.

    "text": "I will start with honestly saying, i didn't really want to eat here. It was my Fiancee's choice of date night though.   Last time I ate at Burgatory, I tried the crab burger. It's about this time when someone yells \"you go to burgatory for burgers! Its not the Crabatory!\"... personally, I feel everything thats on the menu should be executed well, or removed from the menu. The crab burger, was not very good- too much breading, served on a bun...its basically a seafood tasting piece of bread.   Anyhow, back to my second visit. Not in a burger mood, I placed an order for the Korean Tacos, a side of fries, and a Smores shake. Shortly after placing the order, I thought that theres no way I would be able to eat the entire meal....Fortunately (for my stomach, not so much my wallet), the $9 tacos were the size of mini pancakes and they did not come with any side included (3 tacos per order...or $3 per tiny taco). The tacos had a decent flavor, but overall they lacked any great trait, completely forgettable.   The side of fries that I ordered was generous, however, it was an additional $4.50. They were good, but it doesn't take much skill to make good french fries.   As for the S'mores Milkshake.... The flavor was great, the thickness was spot on, the price was a bit steep ($6), but most importantly it was quite disappointing overall. Why? Because my shake that I ordered happened to be 50% whipped Cream. I am not exaggerating. A few sips in I hit thick, creamy whipped cream....and that was it, all that was left really. This could have just been a mistake on mine (although my fiancee's was just as packed with the whipped cream).   My Fiancee made her own burger, it came with a decent side of fries and overall was affordable. She really enjoyed the burger, disliked the shake for the aforementioned reason.   I ended up getting sick the following morning....avoid the tacos.... I know, i know....its not the TACOTORY....but again, don't sell stuff that you can't make well.",

I had a make-your-own-esque burger and the list of things to add to it went on for a full page. Everything from the standard, to pineapple was offered and an addition was only $.50 or $1.  The only thing that was disappointing was the service, but then again it was at a rush on a Friday evening. Overall a great meal for a good price.",

If you aren't into potato chips make sure to ask for fries because that's what they come with. The cost for two burgers water and a shake was 32$ so not bad for a big burger and a lot of food.",

For a burger joint I expect more unique combinations and selection on the build your own menu.  The chips just don't match the prices or the burgers.

I continued to sit, now looking around and still not being greeted by any staff whatsoever. The table to the right of mine was seated and there was a server at the table greeting them before my husband returned from the bathroom. He returned, and we left!

    "text": "So there's obviously a lot of hype about this place.  We went with some people that had been there before, and they all seemed to enjoy it, but this place was not for us.   First off, we get there, and they say there's going to be a 2 hour wait.  So fortunately, they text you when your table is ready, so you can walk around the waterfront.  Unfortunately, there's not 2 hours worth of walking around to do at the waterfront, so after about an hour, we were waiting bored for our table.  And then 2 hours turned into 2 1/2 hours before we actually got seated.  I got a milkshake, and that was very good, albeit a little pricy ($6).  The burgers however left a lot to be desired.  I got the farm burger, which has ham, cheese, and egg on it.  I always get the Royal Red Robin Burger, which is similar (minus the ham), and love that.  This however was not the best.  It was definitely lacking cheese.  I don't like hamburgers without cheese.  The beef patties on these burgers are big, so don't skimp on the cheese!  There was too much beef, and the beef was bland.  I ate about 75% of my burger and just gave up, because I didn't like it enough to finish it.  Too much bland beef taste, and not enough cheese/toppings.    About half the people at our table of 8 didn't finish their burgers.   Not because it was too much food, just because we didn't really enjoy the burgers that much.  I was talking to a friend on the way out who didn't finish, and he said the same thing as me, too much bland beef, not enough cheese.  The fries and chips were good though, and as I already mentioned, so were the shakes, but this is a burger place, not a fry and shake place, so I can say with assurance I'll never be back.   I'd go to Red Robin (comparing it here, because it's right across the street) in a heartbeat over this place.",

I had a veggie burger with the veggie patty, which in itself is fantastic filled with mushrooms and spices and a great texture and I created my own burger with the truffle aoli, horseradish cheddar cheese, and everything else you could possible want on a burger!  You could choose from tons of different sauces, cheeses, buns/ breads, and toppings.  My burger was fresh and crunchy with the crisp iceberg lettuce and moist and creamy with the sauce.  So delicious and I would even dare to say the best veggie burger I've ever had!  The service was also great and I like the fast casual feel of the restaurant without being \"fast food\".  Was too cold for a milkshake but those looked amazing as well.  The one thing to note if you are a vegetarian is they also have the Impossible burger but they don't have it listed on the menu.  I have yet to try the impossible burger but apparently it takes very close to a True burger.  I will definitely be back to this joint next time I'm in Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "This just opened location is right across the street from the movie theater. There have been so many different restaurants in this space I can't keep track of them all.   The space is rather small compared to the previous restaurant that occupied the same space. I'm not sure why Burgatory didn't take more space as the storefront next door is available for lease and was a part of the last restaurant that was there. They need all the square footage they can get.   I still don't get why Burgatory doesn't take reservations so be prepared to wait 1 hour plus on the weekends now that the weather is nice. One really cool new feature they do have is that once you are put into the que of people waiting you can go to the No Wait App and see how many people are ahead of you and when it is time to walk back over to the restaurant.  The wife and I started off with our usual Berry Lemonades and our daughter had a Natrona Vanilla Cream Soda.  For an appetizer we got the Just Fork It (Fresh cut fries smothered with Braised Short Ribs, Cheddar Cheese Curds & Pan Gravy) They were EPIC and worth the wait themselves!   Next my daughter and I both got the Standard Deluxe Burger. It's a burger with White American Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion and their House Burger Sauce. I added bacon and sauteed mushrooms to mine. It was huge and outstanding! The wife got the Hot Chick sandwich. (Grilled Herbed Chicken, Sharp Provolone, Tomatoes, House-Made Guacamole, Chipotle Sour Cream & Cilantro Leaves on Grilled Herbed Focaccia. Served with lightly dressed Field Greens.)  I also like the fact that you can build your own burger in 7 steps .   If you haven't been before here's how it works.  Step 1. Pick your burger.   You have a choice of beef, chicken, bison, sausage, lumb crab or veggie patty as a burger.   Step 2. Pick your bun.   Next you pick your bun with Brioche, Wheat, Baguette, Focaccia,  Topless or Full Monty Style as choices   Step 3. Pick your rub.   Choose from Angel Dust, Kona Crust, BBQ, Kingston Jerk,  Cracked Peppercorn and Bayou Cajun   Step 4. Pick your cheese for $1 more   Choose from Cheddar, White American, Horseradish Cheddar,  Sharp Provolone, Gorgonzola, Mozzarella, Smoked Gouda and Buffalo Cheddar.   Step 5. Pick your sauce.   Choose from Bourbon BBQ, Dijon Mayo, Banana Ketchup, House Sauce, Spicy Marinara, Guacamole, Sour Cream, Roasted Garlic Mayo, Sriracha Remoulade, Buttermilk Ranch, Spicy Ketchup,  Whole Grain Mustard, Avocado Wasabi, Bleu Cheese Dressing,  Buffalo Sauce, Relish and Chipotle Sour Cream   Step 6. Pick a topping for $1 to $1.50 more.   Choose from Fried Egg, Applewood Smoked Bacon, Avocado, Chicken Chili, Caramelized Onion Marmalade, Grilled Pineapple, Sauteed Mushrooms, Maple Cured Ham, Onion Straws, Roasted Tomatoes, Grilled Onions, Brandied Peppercorn, Cabernet Sauce and Roasted Red Peppers.   Step 7. Pick a free topping.   Choose from Iceberg, Romaine, Field Greens, Baby Spinach,  Arugula, Red Onion, Tomato, Poblano Peppers, Cucumbers, Banana Peppers, Bread & Butter Pickles and Jalapenos. Lots of choices and ways to customize your burger.  Our waitress Jordan was great as well and took really good care of us. I think the Waterfront finally has a winner that will last in this once doomed space.",

Our server was fantastic, I wish I had remembered her name! It was a tad slow getting our bill at the very end but that was my only complaint on service. I liked that she did appreciate my weird sense of humor when I was ordering.   The little pitchfork things are cute too, my mom has been collecting them (see where I get my weirdness from? LOL.)   Desperately wish they had the adult shakes in smaller portions. If I tried having a full one myself, I'd probably die of a stroke. Mmm. Sounds amazing though.

So many of my friends rave about this place and I just can't see the appeal. Burgatory is overpriced and often has long waits. Unfortunately, the food doesn't justify the price or the wait.  While the burgers aren't bad, they certainly aren't anything special. Every single time I have gone to Burgatory there has hardly been any sauce on my burger.  I find it kind of ridiculous that they would charge someone for a side of sauce when you have to search the burger to see if there is even any on it. Since they charge for any extra side of sauce, ask for your burger with the sauce on the side. This way you actually get enough sauce for your burger and you can use the extra for your side.   I actually did really like the Campfire Smores shake. However, this is the kind of restaurant that I would go to if all of my friends/family wanted to go, but that I would never suggest to go to. Honestly, there are quite a few restaurants that aren't \"burger-specialty\" with menus that still have quite a few burger options and they are much better. Time to try Fat Heads!  Tip: Use the NoWait app to reserve your table without going into the restaurant. This app is also a great way to figure out beforehand how long of a wait it will be",

In terms of gluten free, they do have a special menu with a slew of options from rubs, to meats, to toppings and even shakes.  Happily they also offer gluten free buns.  Usually I find myself building myself a custom burger.  For example the bison burger with the sweet onion rub, buffalo cheddar cheese, guacamole , romaine, cucumber, and sliced tomato on a gluten free bun with napa slaw.  Last time, i paired this with a root beer float.  It was pretty amazing.   The place itself is pretty cool with a bit of a modern feel.  Plenty of parking available, though it might involve a small walk :D",

Good thing it's located near a prominent shopping area so I was able to keep myself occupied for over an hour. Once my party was seated, the service and food was phenomenal.   I opted for the custom creation beef burger with Cajun rub, truffle shallot aioli and a bunch of greens on a brioche bun. The burger was so juicy and flavorful. They were super generous on the aioli, which I really appreciated. I also had the chance to try their salted nutella crunch milkshake. Oh em gee...the milkshake was truly heavenly with the right amount of crunch, sweetness, creaminess and love. The best part of it all was how quickly our food came out, even though it was a busy night.   Overall, I really enjoyed my time at the Burgatory. My gluttonous taste buds were quite pleased, along with my happy tummy. The long wait was totally worth it and actually not that bad if you just go shopping in the meantime. I highly recommend!",

For my drink, I ordered Rosemary's Smash, which is a gin and tonic cocktail with cucumber and rosemary. There wasn't much rosemary flavoring, but cucumber/gin/tonic combination was delicious. I'd get this again.  The create-your-own burger sheets aren't lying when they say that it's probably the hardest decision of your life. I went through 3 before deciding to alter one of their signature burgers to my liking. The possibilities are endless and I'm looking forward to future visits and exploring more of the combos.   As for the burger itself, it came out just as I had ordered it on the sheet. Slightly pink in the center, and very flavorful. I can't see rating them on flavor combinations since that decision is basically in your hands. For the rest though, a solid 4/5. I need to go back to try the hard milkshakes as well...",

I gave the original location in Aspinwall a glowing review in 2012, but since then I think the Waterworks location has taken the crown as best Burgatory in the growing empire.  Some things are True of all Burgatories: one of the most comprehensive build-a-burger setups anywhere; creative specials; great options for any craving or diet; and enough variety to never get sick of it (which is good, because I don't really get burgers anywhere else in the county these days).  But this location has that extra edge.  The service is a little more efficient.  The restaurant's a little more comfortable.  The vibe is a little more chill.  Even the accuracy of the orders is higher than at other locations (I've never had a single mistake come out of this kitchen, while I can't say the same for any other location I visit regularly).  I do wish they'd bring back the off-menu-meats in the Saturday Burgers of the Day (now it's more of a Burger of the Week system), but overall I'm happy to see the business expand.  But as it expands, this location is my new go-to Burgatory.",

Luckily, there are a lot of shops nearby and you can walk around until they text you that your table is ready.  Pros: The food is not bad. I got a custom made burger with beef, whole wheat bun, garlic mayo, romaine, red onion, tomato, and jalapenos. The meat was cooked perfectly (we chose \"pink\") and got the chips as the side.   Cons: EXPENSIVE. You're gonna be paying about $11-15 for a burger that doesn't even come with fries. The free side is chips, but if you want fries or any other side you have to pay extra. The burgers are also pretty small, especially for the price you're paying. We also got the nachos, and they were not very good. I could've made better nachos myself.   Overall: I don't see what all the hype is about. Burgatory is overpriced and the food is alright, since my burger was good but small and pricey, but the nachos were terrible.",

The GM should have enough knowledge to understand that while there wasn't anything wrong with my fries and drink, he was showing a good gesture to compensate for the inconvenience.  Why would I want the kitchen to make me anything else after finding this so I left hungry and upset over this experience.

The service that they have in the establishment is probably the BEST service I have received in any restaurant. The waiters and waitresses are very kind, polite, and efficient at their job. Make sure to tip them well! Now, the food.  The food in general is absolutely indescribable. When I go to the restaurant, I usually get the Standard Deluxe, the Honey Habanero Wings, and the Salted Nutella Crunch. To start off, the Standard Deluxe is not your typical Burger King sort of burger, this is a True delicacy. The meat of the burger is very tender and feels like real meat, not your standard fast food burger. Next, The Honey Habanero Wings are, dare I say, the best chicken wings I have ever had, funny that it's coming from a burger restaurant. The Honey Habanero sauce itself that they put on the wings is a PERFECT amount of heat and sweet! The meat on the wings is just like the burger, that it feels like real and genuine food. And finally, the Salted Nutella Crunch is straight from heaven! The milkshake tastes very creamy and sooooo savory! If you are a big Nutella fan, I highly recommend ordering this shake. Now, the food and the milkshakes can be a bit pricy here and there, but frankly, if you want a fantastic restaurant experience, it's totally WORTH IT! I have been coming to this restaurant for a while now, and I thought it was finally time to give it the rep it truly deserves. A perfect 5/5 in my book.",

    "text": "The epic Burgatory Review you've waited for...  \"Go to Burgatory!\" \"Burgatory is awesome!\" \"Burgatory has delicious burgers!\"  I went to Burgatory with 3 other people excited to eat!  I didn't have a shred of doubt this would be one of the best burgers and dining experiences I ever had and I can honestly say after last night I'd rather be trapped in real purgatory than ever be put through the hell this place put me through.  Usually, if you look over my reviews out of about 100 or so I have 3 bad ones and they are mostly for fast food places.  You would think this was a run down McDonald's by the service and quality we received.  This is going to be a lengthy review so strap on, they deserve it.  We went there about 8:30, the waitress informed me they stop taking orders at 10:00 so we had plenty of time to have a few beers and talk about our days with each but NOPE, not with this waitress. \"You ready to order, hey you ready to order, ready to order, you guys ready (eyes rolling in her head) you ready to order, ready to order, (huffing) you ready to order, ready to order guys\" and that was all in 10 minutes of us being there.  Finally we decided let's just tell this girl to bring us an appetizer and a beer so she would just let us be for a second.  We even told her it was our first time, she didn't make and recommendations and really seemed like nobody trained her on how to be a server she just said \"I hope you guys don't hate me\"!  No knowledge of the menu, no flow, no charisma no anything you need to be a server.  We ordered nachos.  Lord if this was a sign to get out of there I'm sorry I didn't listen.  These nachos were AAWFUL!!   Soggy chips, globbed on toppings and for real, 5 shredded pieces of lettuce, 5!!!!  All this dish was, was HOT (spicy).  No flavor, no balance in toppings, no love!  When it was over the table agreed these were vomit inducing nachos.    Well ok, our server was bad, our nachos were awful but this is a burger place so they gotta get burgers right, right!?  WRONG!!!  I ordered the most expensive burger they had, a$14.00 supposed Wagyu beef burger.  Don't worry there's a photo on this review of what's suppose to be a prime beef perfectly cooked burger.  They sent me a shriveled burnt piece of shit on a wet soggy bun with equally awful quality toppings!  I brought it AND the nachos to our waitress attention and what did we get? Drumroll for the eye rolls please!  Our whole table was in awe at how awful of a server she was and the ATTITUDE!!  Wow!!   She says to me would you like some fries while you wait for us to remake your burger, I agreed.  I didn't realize you were making me eat the fries that came with the burger!  When they brought me my burger there was no fries with that also, just the burger as if they were penalizing me for sending it back!!    And guess what?  This burger was worse than the first one they brought out!!!  It looked like someone sat on it!  I don't manage restraunts but even Stevie Wonder could see that McDonalds made better Big Macs than this supposed WAGYU GOURMET BURGER.  And the waitress had the nerve to make it seem like they couldn't please me and I was picky!  No, this was shit! A SHIT experience and a SHIT burger.  It physically  looked like cow shit, not cow beef.  At this point I'm fumin!  From the pushy, unknowledgable waitress, attitude driven, unskilled waitress to the sloppy nachos and now this abomination of a burger!!  The last saving grace is the manager, I mean, THEY CAN MAKE IT RIGHT, RIGHT!!???  WRROOOONG!!??  Holy shit this guy had so much attitude!  He had the nerve to say I'm a tough customer to please!  And took half off my NACHOS for the dissatisfaction, what-a-JOKE.  I still paid half my bill of a meal I technically didn't even eat!  Oh, I ate the fries hahahahahahaha.  Rather than just comp my meal, to insult me more he gives me a free shake card hahahahahahahahahahaha I will NEVER be back here for a shake EVER!  Not once did he say \"I'm sorry for your dissatisfaction\" every angle was him either sticking up for how it's prepared or questioning ME!!!  Soggy burnt meal low quality meal Terrible cooks Terrible server with an attitude  Terrible management with an attitude  No resolve to my problem Filthy restaurant  Awful lighting and decor  Unpleasing and unwelcoming all together  I've had much much much better experiences across the road at Red Robin for half the price.    This will go down for me as one of the worst dining experiences I've had not only in/around Pittsburgh but one the worst experience I've had anywhere my entire life!  That was the first and last time I go there or ever speak a word of their establishment.    Save your money and go to Red Robin, or McDonalds.",

    "text": "First time here at Burgatory and I was super excited. I had been dying to check this place out since I moved to Pittsburgh. My husband started out with the s'mores milkshake, being lactose-intolerant, I could not order one for myself, but tried some of his, and it was absolutely delicious.   For our burgers, we had the Standard Deluxe and the Farmer Brown. Our burgers came out more cooked than we liked, which bothered me, but we were rushing to catch a movie so we didn't send them back. Also, our waitress was not very attentive to our needs once our food arrived. We still enjoyed our meal, and I truly see why this place is so amazing and so well loved by everyone. Can't wait to come back to try their other burgers, and I'm definitely getting the home made chips instead of fries next time, trust me, they are so much better!!!",

Most disappointing is that neither the signature Potato Chips nor the French Fries are properly cooked... so they're soggy... the Corn Bread is great along with the shakes... Best of all... The 6 Napkin Nachoes... incredible!",

Unfortunately the service here was less then average. We had to wait 10 minutes to even be waited on. He took our appetizer order first which was great however he didn't come back for our order until after our nachos came.   He didn't come by to get refills except for maybe once. We asked for milk shake menus after our meal which he did promptly but didn't come back to take our order until 15-20 minutes later. There's only 6 selections I think 5 minutes would have been more then enough.   He seems much to into the waitress he was chatting up. Hopefully management reads this and keeps a better eye on how their wait staff is treating their customers.   It is a shame because the food was definitely a lot better then the last time I was here.",

Took a long time to get my onion rings but the manager comped it because the first ones burnt and my dinner came out with it.  They were huge and very good!   I recommend too as suggested to get milkshakes with the burgers. I got the burnt almond one. It had a little too much whipped cream but was enjoyable.  Place had many empty tables for a weeknight and the popularity. Glad i ordered burger pink and red. Mine was medium rare to rare and red must be raw.  Based on the reviews I expected the best burger ever. It was large but didnt have the flavor. I couldnt taste the seasoning or the bbq sauce. I would like to try it again. I think the chef had a bad day.",

    "text": "I remember the first time I went to Burgatory in the Waterworks Mall when they first opened. I was disappointed then just as I am now.  There have been several times in between that were good, but for the most part it's been a miss.  Tonight there were three of us. I myself had a make your own chicken sandwich, and while it was good, the chicken was certainly over cooked. The other chicken sandwich which was ordered as well was also over cooked and dry.  Now, I don't work in a professional kitchen and I never have, but I grill a lot of juicy chicken. pounding the chicken breast thinner will aid in cooking it a bit better instead of leading to over cooking and inconsistency.  The burger which was ordered was very underdone. There is a significant difference between pink, red and no pink. The burger was ordered pink and it was red. Unappetizing. Management made it right by comping the appetizer however.  I'd like to point out several things: It took a very long time for our dinner to arrive. They were not busy. There was no wait to be seated, etc. Our drinks were not refilled consistently and I had to get up and go to the bar to get silverware for the three people in our party.   There is no consistency with Burgatory. It's either really damn good, or completely disappointing.  I enjoyed the beer I had for what it's worth.",

The best thing about this location at least is the Happy Hour from 4-6.   They do $5 appetizers and cheaper cocktails and drafts. Since the apps are around $8-10 normally and are quite large you can easily go to dinner here without paying full Burgatory prices. The fried ribs are friggin' awesome and during happy hour they're a steal.   Prices are the only downside to Burgatory in my opinion. I get tired of spending $15 a burger before tax and tip, and without adding anything extra like a shake.   The shakes are also amazing and can even be customized if you ask for it. No doubt, despite the prices, getting a burger and a shake here is pretty much heaven.   Seating is great in the summer too since they have open windows and semi-open areas for fresh air.   People on this side of the river are very happy they joined the Waterfront and put some pressure on the mega-corp chains that inhabit the area!",

Everything was just fine in that particular area. My issue is with the food experience. I've only been to this restaurant a couple times but there hasn't been an instance where I've come away satisfied with the quality of the food. I don't get it! I'm not a picky eater but I just haven't enjoyed it.  My first visit included a bison burger that I was unimpressed with. I'd much rather go to Five Guys or Smashburger. I did, however, enjoy the milkshake that I ordered.  On my second visit I had one of their sandwiches and again I came away disappointed. STILL... this place is always busy! What could I be doing wrong?? I'm debating another try but I think I'm going to give it some time before I do.",

    "text": "Six months since my first meal here I think it's time to bump my rating up. At this point they've earned it, and I've learned through additional visits that on a good day this Burgatory definitely deserves 4 stars now. (On a bad day I'd still lean toward a 3 though.)  Back when I first visited I was not impressed because, after months of being told Burgatory is the greatest thing EVAR, I received a dry overcooked burger that did not melt in my mouth the way a great burger is supposed to. It was disappointing, but fortunately since then the burgers have been much tastier and juicier. Admittedly this positive trend has usually been when the place is not 100% jampacked with people. When the place is packed - which is the norm - the quality definitely dips back towards that dry burger I remember from visit #1. Since the business of the place affects just how good my burger is, I now know when to give them a pass in favor of cheaper grub.   Another big thing I like is that they offer to-go cups for the shakes - something that I DEFINITELY wish I had known about when I first ate here! I mean really, I'm not going to Burgatory without getting a milkshake. Their standard menu alone is amazing - nevermind how great it is to stop in for the specials, like the Thin Mint shake they served back in March! But when you go with friends who all want something different it's simply impossible to share the behemoth plates and cups of food and drink here. A to-go cup means I'm now able to enjoy all of my food, without forcing myself to eat all of the food in one sitting. Yay!  They're still not my favorite burger place, because there are places in Pittsburgh that don't just make good burgers, but which make truly great, mouthwatering burgers - something I admittedly still haven't gotten from Burgatory. But at least now when my friends suggest Burgatory I can get excited about enjoying a reasonably good burger - and that's a definite improvement!",

There were 4 people in my party and one person ordered a salad. It took an additional 35-45mins for our food to finally arrive after the milkshakes.   When the food finally did arrive, it was tasty but not worth the wait. Our waiter was really nice and comped our milkshakes and appetizer.

    "text": "I went to Burgatory on a Tuesday night with some coworkers for a little get together because I'm moving out of the state and wanted to go to one last time before I leave. I've been to the other locations, always had a pleasant experience, good food, nice servers, and tasty drinks. Each time I've gone to Burgatory I've had a 30 minute to an hour wait. We arrived at 6:45 or so and the hostess said it was about an hour wait. We got on the list, but due to being hungry we decided to drop in for food at a nearby restaurant and come back to Burgatory for drinks. When we got our text that the table was ready we walked over and were seated immediately. The waitress arrived and asked for our drink orders and I told her we probably we're just going to stick with drinks tonight. She went and got some water and came back to take our order. Before taking it she responded by asking how long we waited for a table, and then followed it with a not so tactful suggestion that we could have got millkshakes to go, and that next time we could do that, and that we could get them to go right now. She then preceded to ask us if we wanted to still eat in the restaurant. Well, I didn't know I'd really put Burgatory out by coming in on a Tuesday night just for drinks. Sidenote at that point after her not so warm welcome the idea of leaving was pretty tempting, however those adult milkshakes cannot be taken to go.  Anyways it spoiled my mood, here I had wanted to have my last Pittsburgh hurrah at one of my favorite restaurants and right away we were met with an attitude. Now I know servers have difficult nights and heavy loads, so who knows what the deal was and maybe it wouldn't have happen again.  I just wished it would have been more welcoming and that the server had not insisted on taking the cocktail menu after we ordered. We got the idea and we took took round elsewhere. But Burgatory, that experience really bummed me out.",

Our server was very nice and she did a good job taking care of us.  The food was OK but not amazing - I've had a much better burger at Murray Avenue Grille or Dunning's in Regent Square.  In fact, the menu has three ways to prepare your burger:  Red, pink, or brown.  I ordered my burger red - the server told me that would ensure that the burger would be prepared medium rare.  Unfortunately, while my husband's burger was perfectly medium, so was my burger.  It did take a fair amount of time to receive our food so we didn't have time to wait for another properly prepared meal to arrive.  The manager came by and they comped my meal.  They did try to make it right.  But, for a place that is known for its burgers, to have it come to the table not cooked to order is inexcusable - especially at 2 o'clock on a Tuesday afternoon.  We did enjoy the truffle and Gorgonzola fries and I really loved the spicy baked beans.  If you like gin cocktails, try the Hendricks and mint lemonade which was tasty but a little overpriced at $7.50.  The atmosphere reminds me of a faux postindustrial urban warehouse and boy, is it LOUD.  In the bar area, there are TVs EVERYWHERE and the sound is on.  Even at the end of the lunch rush, the place was really loud.  That was another huge turnoff for us.  It's hard to keep a conversation going at 2 in the afternoon, I can't imagine what the place sounds like during the dinner rush on a Friday night.  No thanks!  Kudos to our server with the funky eyeshadow for taking such good care of us.  She was the high point of our experience.  Unfortunately, good service from one person doesn't entice me to return.  I don't think that we will be back.",

A joke.  I installed the app, and put myself on the list which said 15-30 minute wait and they would text me when our table was ready.  I checked in and was told there was a 60-75 minute wait. WTF. What happened to my slot? Oh, that just got me on a list do you want to speak to the manager?  This was the second evening I tried. Same result both times. This place needs to change there system.  I won't be back.",

Once you get seated there's a tablet where you mark off everything you want on your burger, you \"make your own burger.\" There's also a menu that you can pick a sandwich that is already pre made. It can get a little pricey if you check off a lot of stuff for your burger. It's totally worth it! Everything was so good! I got the caramel pretzel shake for dessert and it was incredible! I will definitely go back to Burgatory again. I would like to try other locations as well.",

Had a pretty bad experience my first time here when ordering at the bar; I asked how long the wait would be for the food to be done and was told less than 30 minutes. So I waited patiently while eating the shake I ordered. When I asked where my food was about 10 or 15 minutes after I expected it to be done, someone went back to find out and brought it back cold. So I had to rush to finish my cold burger and fries before my lunch break time was up. It was a while before I went back after that bad experience, but my other experiences have been better.",

That being said the staff can sometimes be invisible as far as wanting to order or when sitting at the bar and there's only one bartender.   Seating is the worst part of this place. I refuse to take the bench seating that you basically sit right next to some stranger with and can have no private conversation.   All in all I would ask for a booth or sit in the bar area. Know what you want when you get there and don't keep the waitress coming back or she'll forget about you.",

    "text": "Burgatory never fails to hit the spot when I'm craving a huge burger.  * Food - I typically go for The Potluck because it's huge and filling but this time I opted for the special of the day. It was a chicken burger with cilantro and some kind of avocado stuff with the Diablo seasoning and man was it spicy (in a good kind of way). I've never had the chicken burger but this has made me a little curious so maybe next time I'll get it with some of the other seasonings and create my own. I was too early for happy hour this time but it's Monday - Friday from 4-6 and they have half off appetizers (worth it), half off drafts (even more worth it), and the cocktails are cheaper. They always have an outstanding beer list as well.  * Atmosphere - During the day it's not so bad lighting wise and the noise level is tolerable. At night the place gets dim and they turn the music up. That's great on a Saturday night but can be too much if you're trying to have a conversation. Cool theme otherwise and witty sayings all over the place.  * Service - I've never had bad service at any of the Burgatory locations but today was one of the first times I had some thorough details about some of the menu items when I inquired about them. Servers name was Heather and she was very spot on with her flavor descriptions regarding the special and gave me an idea of what to expect since I was weary about the amount of spice. Super personable, very witty, and was more than patient with all of my questions. Burgatory is pretty consistent with their servers being fun individuals, though, so no surprise there.  She also really knew her beers and flavor profiles which was really helpful because this restaurant always has beer that I've never had before. They only carry one very common name on draft and that's Yuengling (my foolproof go to). Everything else is craft but always worth a taste.   * Location - It was a nice day so I had to write about this. The Waterfront is a great shopping area. Modest amount of stores but very walkable especially on a nice day. It's nice to browse and window shop while sucking down a shake (suggestion: basic chocolate. It's a classic and they do it right.)",
