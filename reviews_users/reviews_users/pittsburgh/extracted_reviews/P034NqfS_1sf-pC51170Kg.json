I have only been disappointed here once, when the portion size of the salmon they gave me on the entree salad I ordered was miniscule, but they more than made up for it by delivering a whopping piece to the table toot sweet. I've not had a bad meal here since, and I've worked through quite a bit of the menu. They have a vegetarian lasagne on the seasonal menu right now that is one of the best I've ever had. Their entree salads are satisfying and filling, as well as delicious, so I don't feel deprived when I skip the pasta here, as I sometimes do. They'll make any pasta dish with whole wheat spaghetti, which is a nice touch. Great service, a varied and interesting menu, and delicious food.",

If you've read my Applebee's review you'll know that I can't stand that place.  We went here for my father's b'day dinner celebration and I ordered the chianti braised beef ravioli.  It was very good and the portions were big enough that I had plenty of left overs for another full meal.    We shared the chocolate cake desert which was delish!  Prices are extremely reasonable and the wine selection is decent.      We went on a Thursday and I was surprised that there was a wait for a table since this place is huge and it was sorta in the middle of the week.  But we didn't wait for too long - probably 15 minutes before our buzzer went off.",

With that being said I blew a hundred dollars on the eggplant that was impossible to cut. My poor partner who has celiac, ordered the gluten free pasta. It floated to the table in watered down sauce, the pasta was chewy, and cheap garlic powder made it uneatable. The best part of the dinner? The cofee and desert. l really dispise paying a lot for crappy food. Bravo was good at one time, but the last few times l was there l felt as if it's a step away from the Olive Garden.",

    "text": "Rather good & fresh Italian food for a place that is a chain and is located in a strip mall-ish area. The inside is large with many tables so you shouldn't ever have to wait too long, and there are many servers and chefs so your food should come out pretty quickly. Also, the corkage fee is only $5 so you can easily bring a bottle to enjoy with your meal.  I would definitely recommend including one of their side salads with your entree. I had the chopped salad which was delicious (all fresh ingredients, a lot of toppings) and my boyfriend had the house salad which he really enjoyed. I ordered the napoli pizza, which was pretty good: the crust is thick & bready, a lot of cheese, but the sauce was low on flavor & the \"fresh basil\" listed as an ingredient actually was 1 giant basil leaf baked into the middle of the pizza (no longer fresh and not really edible), though all in all it was a good pizza.  My boyfriend had the shrimp & lobster ravioli with sherry tomato sauce and he really enjoyed it. We were both too full for dessert, but there were some yummy looking choices.   The servers didn't seem particularly happy but it was New Years Eve so they probably wanted everyone to eat & leave quickly so they could too. Our waitress kept giving us & the bottle of champagne we brought funny glances but I think it was because she was trying to figure out how old we were and whether to ask...after we showed our IDs, she was quite nice. All in all, it was a satisfying meal and I definitely recommend eating here.",

Growing up my grandfather was a seafood buyer for a chain grocery store, and my dad is an extremely talented fisherman. It's safe to say I've had some phenomenal dinners in my life. When I was a teenager, my family and I dined at Wholly's Restaraunt in the strip, and my whole family raved about their lobster bisque. Since then I've only had really good lobster bisque a handful of times. Wholly's. Awful Arthur's in Nagshead, NC. Bravo. Bravo's lobster bisque is very creamy, so if your looking for a bisque with chunks of lobster meat, I would not recommend it, I'd probably send you to Wholly's.  I prefer Creamier bisque so this is definitely a fave. I also love Caesar salads, and while I think Red Lobster's Caesar dressing is the best, Bravo!s is pretty yummy. It's very creamy and a little ,more fishy than most. (After all anchovies are part of what give Caesar its flavor) but very good. The Caesar salad is pretty big but deliscious nonetheless. I also like their feta dip appetizer, but haven't seen it on the menu in a while, so I'm not sure if it is a special or not. Overall love this Restaraunt and keep coming back.",

If I drained the soup I might get enough tiny pieces of pasta to make up a teaspoon. I was very disappointed.  For my main dish I ordered the Insalada de Lacasa. It is a salad tossed with a Parmesan dressing. I ordered chicken on top. When my salad came it was the wrong salad. I rarely send food back but I sent the salad back as soon as I saw that it was wrong. The salad was okay but the chicken was dry. Again I was disappointed.  My order was simple yet it was wrong and the food was \"meh\" to quote the Hipsters. The only reason for 2 stars was the service. Our waitress was very nice and kept our drinks filled. Ashe also came to clear our dishes as soon as there was an empty plate. One of the waiters even took a moment to take our picture for us.

    "text": "I've eaten here a number of times but haven't bothered to review it.  I try very hard to avoid chain eateries but am out of options in the area I live in sometimes and resort to desperation.  I like some of what they do.    I had the Tuscan Grilled Chicken Sandwich with green onion mayonnaise and spicy Tuscan slaw. Served with a salad of field greens, Roma tomatoes, Gorgonzola, Mediterranean grain and balsamic dressing.  It was over $10.  The chicken was really dry and burnt in spots.  It wasn't great.  Overall the value was borderline.  I was really even more outraged at what Miriam got when she ordered soup and salad.  This was over $8 and you should have seen the portion.  I couldn't believe it.  It was like a cup of greens and 1/2 of their tiny little tureen of soup.  Seriously?  How much does lettuce cost?  I don't know if she loved it.  I was too busy wondering why they would send this out.  The pick 2 at Panera with soup and salad is $2 less and you get more food than this.  I am not a fan of Panera but the food seems par when you get down to the soup and salad she got.  I haven't been bummed out enough in the past to bother writing.  Mostly we go for dinner.  The chicken Marsala is pretty good and the chicken Romano salad is also one of my standards and is aok too.      I hate the bread they send out and always opt out.  It's trite with their little pool of olive oil and the bread is of poor quality.  I guess I am just a little tired of this place and was especially disappointed with our last visit.  We had one last year that was pretty bad too.",

The place was quieter than in the past, probably because we visited in between lunch and dinner so the crowd was thin which cut down both on chatter and kitchen noise. My salmon was well-cooked but the portion was a bit smaller than expected. Probably for the best, from a caloric standpoint. Good service from our server Andy.

Had originally discussed with the manager the event , he stated we would love the setting and we would be in a four half wall enclosed area for the event.  Got there this Friday night, and was immediately told by the hostess that we were late that we were scheduled to arrive at 5 pm, I had not once mentioned a 5 pm start time, it was originally to be at 6 pm but had to change it to 7 pm due to the rehersal time being changed, I had called to change this time and also confirmed that.  We were seated literally in the kitchen area, I understand it is an open kitchen style restaurant, but the area we were seated in appeared to be not utilized by customers at all, we were crammed together at our table so tight that you could barely move your arms.  There was water all over the floor by myself ( mother of the groom) and the brides parents, the server stations were right behind our heads.  It was so loud and when the bride and groom attempted to speak to thank everyone and pass out gifts at the table you could not even hear them speak.  The staff did try to make amends but it was too late for that, this was an epic fail on all levels.  Ruined an event that we can never redo.  I would never recommend this for events of any kind, and no one of the two managers I spoke with openly took responsibility for the issues, they basically passed the buck that it was someone else's fault.  They did adjust the bill and offered free appetizers, but this was not helping the event.  I had worked so hard for this wedding and did not even eat there that evening because I was so upset, the two bites of food that I did take were awful as well, this place is a step below an Olive Garden , and I'm Italian and not really a fan of their food either. All thanks for nothing BRAVO, thanks for ruining our event.",

    "text": "I definitely appreciate that they have gluten free pasta, but I was underwhelmed with my spaghetti bolognese and I don't think it was the GF pastas fault. Bravo used to be my JAM back in college. I actually preferred it over Olive Garden. I thought their dishes had more flavor and I liked the environment more.   Now that I've frequented so many awesome local businesses over the years doing killer dishes, the place just feels different now. But when you're in the Galleria and have a screaming toddler in tow, this just works.   So I just wish the bolognese would have had more flavor. It definitely lacked much of anything and I was definitely hungry shortly after I ate it because the meat portion wasn't very big either. Plus, no carrots in the bolognese? I thought that was part of the authentic dish?   Service was also spotty. Our server didn't come back with our first drink order for a while. We had to ask for them actually. Then my husband needed a fork after we were served our main dishes, and the server said okay, then immediately went to the computer to put in an order. Maybe five minutes later I saw him out of the corner of my eye walk over to get a fork, but my husband had already gone to another table and grabbed his own fork at that point. Like I said, not great.   I'd pick BRGR over this place at the Galleria any day.",

The chicken and noodles were cooked nicely, there was plenty of cheese covering the dish, and a good amount of flavor on the breading. The sauce was a bit too sweet for my taste, but it didn't ruin the dish. Caesar salad was also good and refreshing.   The service on the other hand was disappointing. While our servers were very nice, and probably overwhelmed on a Friday night, there were a several things that hindered my experience. We had a private room for our party of 14, so I expected more attentive behavior. It took a while for our drinks to come, my friend's was the wrong one and we had to ask about my friend's beer 2 times before she told us they were out and another would have to be ordered. We also had to ask for bread to be brought to our table. The food took what felt like forever too. The manager did come in to give an update of our meals and apologize. Then came us trying to pay our check. I would estimate it look 15min for her to come back and swipe the card. Overall a good place for food with many menu options, but could use more employees to cover the Friday rush so it wasn't a 3hr process.",

They have a lot of seating but the occasion called for a full house! Just amazing to see people enjoying with the parents!  The drinks - the good old 'old fashioned' was nice and so was the lobster bisque soup . It just paired up really well with the hot bread . Like a lot of yelpers have mentioned - the bread with the dipping oil is good !  The food was a disappointment- just assumed that the Bravo Pasta( with mushrooms and chicken) would hit it out of the park- but it was only average but thank god for atleast average since the chicken Parmesan just did not make the cut :( little flavor to it - and I could get the same at any cheap Italian joint . Desert- the seasonal which was a berry cake with vanilla ice cream. Well presented but just an average desert One more thing - a fellow yelper mentioned to be careful with the cutlery - so we made sure that we checked everything before using it and ALAS - a dirty spoon came with the soup . I'll still go again but only for the ambience and the nice restaurant decor",

This... this was my lunch.  My tastebuds were watering from the moment my eyes met the building exterior.  As my family entered the establishment, we were greeted by two lovely young ladies. One had a small zodiac tattoo behind her ear. We were seated by the windows overlooking the walkway terrace.   My cousin ordered the shrimp scampi, my brother had the chicken parmesan, and I opted for the classic spaghettini and meatballs.  Regrettably, the scampi was served in a butter sauce that \"lacked a distinct flavor\". I also received reports from my sister that her portion was \"not big\".  Now, the spaghettini and meatballs. Apparently spaghettini is a shorter noodle with smaller diameter. The flavor of the tomato sauce was indulgent but not overpowering. The meatballs were certainly the star of the plate. A wonderful crust on the outside with a tender and flavorful interior. Had the portion been a bit bigger or the price a bit smaller, Bravo! would have a perfect plate on their hands.  The chicken parm was \"good\".  I feel strong in my evaluation of three stars. Main factors were portion consistency, overall taste, servers, aesthetic, and pricing. I would happily return to Bravo! with appropriate expectations.",

    "text": "Wonderful experience.  Our home kitchen has been under construction for three weeks.  I have ordered a plethora of carryout and delivery from all over the area.  I've had a lot of bad experiences.  Besides pizza, this was the first restaurant that got everything right.  Ordering carryout on their website was terrific.  Everything was easy and self explanatory.  I didn't have to change anything, however, if I wanted to add an extra something-something, or remove an ingredient, there were boxes to check to accomplish that task.  The food was fine.  It was well boxed and, most importantly, everything was there.  Everyone that I spoke with, inside of Bravo, was also very courteous.",

    "text": "I normally love eating at Bravo's, but tonight was awful. The night started with our waitress asking what we wanted to drink, she brought back regular water instead of sparkling. She then proceeded to place oil for bread on the table. About 15 minutes pass and we see other tables getting bread, but we have not received any and no one has asked for our order. After telling her we would like bread and SPARKLING water, she says 'yeah'. Like we just inconvenienced her greatly. Finally she takes our order and then brings our food. As soon as she places it and walks away, I comment that there is a hair in my moms food and for her not to eat it. We then tell the waitress and all she does is pick up the food and take it away. No apologies, no nothing. We then decide to just leave, so we go up to our waitress and she asks if we want another salmon dish. She clearly had NOT placed another order in  with the kitchen and just seemed to expect us to sit there and not have another meal. We then left and on our way out, we spoke to a manager. The manager was never informed that our food had a hair in it and gave us coupons. The best part is, the coupon is 10 dollars off when you spend 40 dollars. Utterly useless and terrible service.",

I had the special Easter frittata which was stuffed with Boursin cheese and served with a chopped salad. My hubby had a glazed pork chop, that was fall off the bone tender, with whipped potatoes and French green beans. This was accompanied by their herbed bread and dipping oil. Every bite was delicious.  We love their Bellinis with peach nectar that are served  slightly frozen. It was busy, but we had an attentive server. We like the ambience, open kitchen, brick pizza oven, and outdoor seating. It's never too loud here. Some restaurants are so loud that you can't enjoy a conversation at your table. Not a problem here.  I definitely recommend Bravo's. Bravo!",

    "text": "A disappointment.   I've been to many Bravo locations over the years and have liked them and their food. This location is let down by the service and the food.   The wait staff is generally distracted, and more interested in interacting with each other than with the customers.   The open-kitchen concept is fine with me, but it's way too loud. Sounds like they are dropping cookie sheets on the floor every 30 seconds.  I wet my pants every time they crash something.  Finally, the food is too inconsistent. Cheese is barely melted on the chicken parm, not golden at all. The entree salads are sometimes huge, and sometimes tiny. The greens are the cheap part, so don't skimp on the easy stuff in a $15 salad. It's just lack of attention to detail.",

    "text": "Went to Bravo on New Year's Eve. We were seated at a nice table by the window up front so we thought. There was a party in a private room next to us and a very large party in a partitioned part of the dining room. Well Bravo limited their access to the dining room by blocking an entrance with tables. The only access for this party of 60 was through the private room and squeezing past our table. At first I was very cordial and cooperative. After we had to ask for several condiments and forgetting our soups it became a hassle. I was paying for my dinner just like the large party. Waitresses and busboys were squeezing around us by the tens. No less than 40 people crossed our paths. I was surprised the Fire Marshall would  approve the limited exit paths. The final straw was a hostess with extremely long hair down past her butt flinging past through the narrow access and her hair wishing though my pasta. We told her she needed to put her hair up...she replied that since she was a hostess and not a server...she wasn't required to comply with the same requirements as the servers. She then informed me \" you will have to stand and move so another large party could get to their table\". Not a please will you stand so we may seat? More of a move your ass. Food was just edible...I know it's a chain so I didn't expect much. The Shrimp Alfredo was lacking all flavor. Again I realize they were busy that night but you need to service people to keep up with standards. Do yourself a favor...drive past Bravo and try Armstrong's, Pasta Too or Dellalos when you have a hankering for Italian Food. I guarantee a much better quality of dinner and much friendlier, attentive service.",

But then gave us 2 wine glasses that were so grimey that the bottoms stuck to the tablecloth. I could actually see someone's lipstick on my glass. They were filthy. GROSS!  When we pointed out how dirty our wine glasses were to our waitress she said, \" I will have to talk to the kitchen about changing the water in the dishwasher.\"  WHAT? !  Does that mean they reuse the water in the dishwasher?! That's disgusting. She brought new wine glasses that were pristine clean. But..... having to inspect all my dishes and glasses before I touch them is not what I consider to be a pleasant dining experience. This place obviously has poor cleanliness standards. I do not recommend going there. There was no apology for the filth. In fact,  the waitress didn't seem one bit surprised that our dishes and our glasses were filthy.",
