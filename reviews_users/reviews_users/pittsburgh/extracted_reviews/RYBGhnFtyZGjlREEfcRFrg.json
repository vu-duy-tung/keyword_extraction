    "text": "It might be a \"hole-in-the-wall,\" but it's a pretty nice hole with some decent looking walls and amazing food.  Tram's has, arguably (though it might not be much of an argument), some of the best tasting food in Pittsburgh, period.  An instant bonus star for being extremely vegetarian friendly.    My date and I split tofu spring rolls which were fresh, delicious and went well with the peanut based sauce provided.  For the main course I had tofu vermicelli which was by far the best item of food I've had since I've moved to this city.  With generous amounts of tofu, vermicelli and whatever coconut based heavenly sauce they put in it, it's hard not to finish an entire bowl.  Throw in some Sriracha and garlic hot sauce and It's almost too good to be True.   For desert we split an order of \"banana cake,\" which sounds kind of stupid, but is actually incredible.  I have no idea what they put in it--maybe a rice based cake, with some beans cooked in, topped with coconut banana cream with sesame seed garnishing?  Really though, who cares?  You just accept it for what it is and eat because it's delicious.  All of this food for two people with prompt service for $25.  How could you not give this place 5 stars?  A big shout out to Tram too.  I think he's the dude with with amputated arm. He's the man.    Don't' come here dressed to the nines, expecting a ritzy meal.  Do come here for great food in a casual, yet clean and hospitable environment.  You won't be disappointed.",

Having only been to Tram's a pair of times when I worked at the now-gone-and- replaced St. Francis Medical Center, I recall their beef fried rice to have supernatural qualities; 'twas the very best I'd ever had anywhere.   Kay felt like Vietnamese food last night, and since I hadn't been here in close to a decade, we popped in for a spot of food.  Ignore the paint peeling from the walls.   Take co-owner/server Thao Le Truong, his limited English skills, and his no-nonsense personality with a grain of rice. If anyone deserves to be living The American Dream, it is Mr. Truong. He is there to take your order, serve you your food, and get you on your way. He is not there to make you feel special, joke with you, or be impressed by you. Have some compassion for a man who has obviously led a more difficult life than his clientele of hipsters and yuppies (it was scarves, low-rise jeans, thick-rimmed glasses, and slender people galore Friday night!) likely ever will.   Have some Vermicelli, with coconut milk and shrimp, like I did. Bite into the tight, plump, vibrant prawns, slurp up the soft noodles, crush the bean sprouts between your teeth, drink the milky broth, and experience edible, drinkable comfort from a Vietnamese perspective. Have some crispy, oily, richly-filled egg rolls as a starter. Dip them into that syrupy sauce I cannot identify. Enjoy.   When we arrived at Tram's, we were disappointed at first since it looked to be too full at the moment to accommodate Kay and I, but as soon as Mr. Truong caught sight of us, he held up two fingers, scrambled about, and seemingly pulled a small table and two chairs out of thin air to seat us over in a far corner of the restaurant where we could see everyone without being seen.  As far as Kay's \"Saigon Soup\" went, I had to finish it for her and found that it went down easy on a brisk winter evening, filling my stomach with love.   I'm certainly not a world-traveler who is well-versed in Vietnamese cuisine, but Kay and I both took pleasure in what we ate. Leave whatever pretensions you may have at home if you choose to come here and do the same.  P.S. The service was acceptable, none of the staff, including Mr. Truong, were rude to us, and while the dining room won't win awards from interior design magazines, we didn't find the place to be \"dirty\" either.",

Tram's Kitchen tastes like home cooking, and it also feels like home with the owner's kids running around.   But the bun thit nuong (pork vermicelli) was pretty sub-par, even with my already low expectations for a Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh (we're Vietnamese from Cali so our expectations are usually really high!). The pork was so dry and tough it was inedible for me (though the bf ate all of his). The egg rolls were okay but just not the kind I'd sell at a restaurant. The spring rolls were edible yet I have to say the worst I've had (even I make way better ones).   The waiter/owner(?) is really sweet, and I feel a bit guilty for not supporting the restaurant but I'm sure those that love this place will keep it going strong. I'll try this place once more and hope to give it a better review next time!",

It has its MSG and pho broth they use for everything (even vegetarian dishes), but their rice dishes are wretched and everything is just mediocre without thrills. So why does everyone love this place? Well I hate to break it, but most of the frequenters are white and for some reason they became the authority on judging a good or bad Vietnamese restaurant, even if health inspectors closed it down (twice?).  With that being said, it's a good soup restaurant. That's right, not pho but \"soup\" restaurant. Vegheads beware, not cruelty free.",

    "text": "SETTING: Watermelons, that's the first thing I noticed. Patterns of cartoon watermelons graced all the tablecloths. The TV was on and showing soccer matches. One of the servers, a Messi fan, celebrated with a \"GOALLLLL!!!\" at one point. As a family-owned restaurant, I wasn't surprised to see two of their little ones horsing around near the kitchen and getting into an argument. Ah, young sibling love. Low key \"hole-in-the-wall\" spot with smells of an authentic asian restaurant.  FOOD: I was a bit confused with the menu. I was here for pho, and I thought there would be plenty of options. Turns out, when I asked about pho, he pointed only to one option (the last item under \"Noodles\"). For my pho, I went with the beef and meatballs for my meat and shared and order of eggrolls (2 pieces/order).  The eggrolls were moist inside and crunchy on the outside like you would expect. Slightly greasy. Came with a clear dipping sauce. Pho only had a few pieces of sliced beef but had a good amount of beef meatballs. The side dish that always comes with pho only had 2 small pieces of lime, basil leaves that were a bit brown and not too fresh, and no peppers. I was a bit disappointed in their lack of accompanying garnishes. On the plus side, what stood out to me was the savory broth/soup that the rice noodles and meat were cooked in. Delicious and much needed for a cold and rainy day.   Unfortunately, having had pho in California, I had plenty to compare to. Although the pho here was pretty basic and satisfying, it would be nice if the pho here had more slices of beef or had the usual options for tripe, beef tendon, brisket, flank, etc.   SERVICE: Hardworking kitchen and serving staff. English does not seem to be their first language, so sometimes it is a bit difficult to communicate. They brought out spring rolls instead of the eggrolls we ordered and when we expressed our confusion, they thought we wanted to place an order of eggrolls in addition to the spring rolls.    IMPRESSIONS:  Tram's is a family-owned restaurant, sharing Vietnamese culture with the Pittsburgh community. As a child from an immigrant family, I always have admired the courage and work ethic of immigrant families who are chasing the American Dream. I've heard this is one of the better pho spots in Pittsburgh, but knowing that I've had better (albeit in California where I grew up) makes it difficult for me to go out of my way to come back. When I do have another craving pho, I wouldn't mind visiting again.",

I really liked the fact that wait was pretty short and the apps we got which were spring rolls really were delicious.   The pho itself was excellent, came in with a little dish with fresh basil, limes, and bean sprouts to add to your bowl. The broth by itself was amazing. The meatballs in my dish were also very flavorful, and added a more depth to my pho.  My husband had the Saigon Soup with pork and shrimp. Both soups were just amazing and just perfect for a chilly night.   I am honestly glad I found this little place. It looks so unasuming from the street, but it is just a jewel. Check it out.",

The food is on par if not better than the majority of well known/respected vietnamese places in Los Angeles.  BTW, the owner is hilarious. Someone mentioned in another review he was a mind reader... I totally get it. Lol. Since it was our first time there, we had no clue on what to get, we were stumbling over ourselves when the owner comes over and says \"YOU. Get this.\" And points at the menu. \"You will like with your wine\" holy smokes was he right :) loved the food! Btw. Did I mention BYOB??? No corkage fee either. Score.  One and only thing to keep in mind is the establishment is CASH ONLY.",

Trams had me covered with a \"pho-style\" vegetarian soup, which smelled and tasted very similar to its beef counterpart. Another plus to the veggie pho was the incredible garlic taste added to it and the cloves floating in the bottom - yum!  I can't believe how great the prices are here. It's cash only, but the day I was here the atm wasn't working and staff wasn't too empathetic or helpful for customers who had trouble with it. The staff was very helpful and knowledgable but serious and down-to-business, and not one of them ever acknowledged  a \"thank you\" from any customer during the entire time we were at the restaurant. Don't take it personally, it's part of the vibe here. Also, BYO.",

My total bill doesn't reflect the price of the dishes I ordered. My bill came out to be higher than what's listed on the menu. Maybe because I'm vietnamese and being a visitor to Pittsburg for the first time, they think is ok to overprice their dishes on a Sunday night.   Although the old man at the place is nice, this place doesn't deserve the stars that's given. I don't recommend this place to anyone especially my Vietnamese comrades whom may visit to Pittsburg looking for good authentic home town cooking.",

No doubt, Phoenix and California have robust enough populations of Vietnamese folks to create stiff competition, and the places I frequented there put me over-the-moon.

Tram's has a fairly full menu, but there are two things on the menu that you should be ordering:  the soups (particularly, the beef pho) and the fresh spring rolls.  That's it.  If you've had Pho in other cities, you might not understand Tram's.  There's no Vietnamese community in Pittsburgh, so you can't get all the trimmings you might have come to expect:   no tripe, no tendon, no other strange meat parts. Just beef or chicken.  But what sets Tram's apart, in my view, is the quality of his broth.  I have eaten Pho all around the US, and Tram's broth is, in my view, the very best I've had.  So get the pho (or, if you're in the mood for something different, the Saigon Soup), get the spring rolls, and skip everything else on the menu.  Then you'll understand Tram's.  Incidentally, the owner's name is not \"Tram\".  His name is Le Thao.  Tram is his daughter, who was left behind in Vietnam for many years, when his son needed a kidney transplant in the US.",

I'll preface my story with its probably the best Pho/vietnamese in Pittsburgh...yada yada...delicious...yada yada...cheap...yada yada...great pho  BUT a lot of ppl have said its no-frills, angry servers who throw food at you.  And this has been the case a few times before my story tonight.  I've never minded.  TONIGHT though...i went to get some take out pho on a snowy evening.  I had to wait for a few minutes...and the owner was nice enough to engage me in conversation while I waited.  I get my Pho...paid..and I get in my car...and drove away...  A block later, due to the snowy weather and my inability to slow brake...I squealed to a stop when some guy ran out into the street.  I did stop in time, spared his life...BUT MY PHO WAS EVERYWHERE!  Most of it was in the bag, but a good portion was on the floor...on the seat...MORE IMPORTANTLY, NOT IN MY BELLY.  So I drove into a parking lot...had to dispose of the mess...and cried.    Now not only did I NOT have pho...my car now smelled enticingly of beefy broth.  So in a moment of frenzy, I thought...What the heck...im only a block away, IM GETTING MY PHO.  So I went back...and got my pho!  AND...the guy didn't even charge me.  He was SO nice and he was like \"You said you dropped it, I believe you! here!\"  omfg, I EFFING LOVE THIS PLACE.",

What sets Tram's apart for me are 2 things.  1.  The spicy prawn is really different.  I am not sure what it is that gives it its unique flavor and appeal but I have never had anything like it.  2.  The spring rolls are absolutely amazing.  I know that the spring rolls should technically be very basic--the ingredients are generally well understood etc, there are no real secrets etc.  For whatever reason, these are the best springs I have ever had.",

Everything inside is very bare bones...you'll get a chair, some chopsticks and sriracha sauce... but  you're guaranteed to get a delicious and a very economical meal. The food was very fresh and filling, and the restaurant pulls in a steady crowd. The pho is excellent, and they also have menu options for vegetarians.

    "text": "I didn't care too much for the atmosphere because most hole in the wall sort of restaurant are authentic & non-Americanized (which is what I'm looking for).  Location of the restaurant was in a run down (kind of Old Pittsburgh style) and parallel parking was a must, be aware that you may have to park far and walk to the restaurant if you're not able to get front door service.  Inside I didn't expect much, tablecloths were vinyl and chairs with uneven stands.  All I care about was the authenticity of the food & cost for what it's worth.  I started my meal with an appetizer of Goi Cuon with shrimp.  I was highly disappointing when disecting what was in it.  There was 1 shrimp cut in half lengthwise, mainly bun (rice noodle) for fillers along with a few strands of beansprouts & lettuce to make it look presentable.  I quickly devoured the tiny appetizer in 2 bites.  My main entree was Pho Ha Noi.  It took forever for the food to arrive, it was a big bowl.  Until I stirred it around to find out it was mainly broth and green onions.  The broth was flavorless, actually it didn't have any flavor; so I had to add hoisin sause to give it a little of whatever to go along with the sliced pork.  I was confused about the noodle itself, Pho is usually served with flat vermicelli noodle; but this Pho Ha Noi was served with round vermicelli noodles usually for Bun Bo entree.  I asked the old man with the amputated arm, why it was served with bun (round rice noodle) instead of pho (flat rice noodle) noodles, he laughed and insisted it was pho (flat rice noodle).  Ok I may be young but I wasnt born yesterday, I think I know my pho noodle and sorry it wasn't.    Next visit to the 'burgh, I think I'll try Pho Minh & see how their PHO compares to Tram's Kitchen.  So HIGHLY disappointed with my Pho experience.",

The spring rolls are excellent, too.  I just wish they served 33 beer to go with it all.    Service is good, if a bit gruff.  Don't screw around chit-chatting at the table when you come in; you need to be ready to order when the waiter (Tram?) gets to you.  Failure to do so will expose you to his withering scorn.  (Seriously, he'll hang out, staring at you, until you make up your mind.)    Price is right, too.  With spring rolls and an entree, you'll get out of here for under $10/person.",

In terms of food, the service was quick, the food was piping hot and quite delicious. I was expecting more fresh herbs on the pho, but the complex broth more than made up for any lackings.

The other dishes are usually well made and well seasoned.    I enjoy the short menu and the waiter who is fun to interact with.  This place is usually pretty busy even on a weekday evening.

It tastes so good especially with lime juice and Thai basil. It is the candy of soups, or at least I think so. However, I went once and I must have felt too adventurous and ordered some type of noodle dish, I forget the name. The chicken looked pan seared but it was room temperature and the rest of the dish was cold, which did not mix well with the chicken. It was covered in a clear broth and lettuce was piled high. This could have been normal for the dish, but I just did not like it and the chicken weirded me out. I gave my leftovers to my boyfriend who said he enjoyed it...but I am pretty sure he will eat (almost) anything.   I gave this place 4 stars because the service is terrible. The food does come out quickly but if you have a question about the menu, forget it. The waiter either does not understand or does not care to answer. Also if you do not know what you want when the waiter gets to your table he seems upset/mad even though they could gave you 5 minutes to look over the menu. Once when I was there they made a large party of 5+ move tables once they were seated with their drinks to squeeze in a table for 2. That was definitely entertaining to watch, but it was just bad service in opinion.   Anyways, this place has the best  soup I tasted in Pittsburgh. Just make sure you know what you want when you get there and don't mind sitting in close proximity to other diners!   Oh and the spring rolls and peanut sauce are delicious and tastes fresh. mmmm....",

I was not expecting stellar service but reading the reviews online, I was certain this place would be a gem. Its small, cluttered and the decor is what you would expect from a hole in the wall. I didn't come here for their amazing bathrooms or pretty displays, though. It was 13 degrees outside...I wanted some pho!  The com tam came with a big pork chop, two fried eggs, some veggies and some sliced pork. It came with a nuoc cham (dipping sauce) that my girlfriend loved! After she ate all of I told her it was made with fish sauce but she still loved it.  The pho was some of the best I have ever had! The broth was fragrant and subtle. There was tons of meat in the dish, too. They only had three  types of pho, which was disappointing. But it was simply delicious. The brought over the condiments and veggies. The only thing they did wrong was not bring the sliced chili peppers along with the soup. After a generous portion of chili oil, my soup still needed some bite. I asked the employee for chili and he brought it immediately.  The spring rolls were awesome, too. They were smaller than other places we've been but they had a ton of shredded pork in them. I actually like the smaller size anyway because they were easier to eat.  I'm not a vegetarian but they had a vegetarian menu that was just as large as the regular menu.  Finally, the price was right. Everything was about 20% cheaper than other Vietnamese restaurants we've been to. I would have liked more selection of the types of meat in the pho, but the one I had was the best I've ever had.",

It's kind of a hole-in-the-wall kind of place, but the food is what I expected walking in.  Spring rolls are not flavorful and has too much minced meat and not enough of veggies for a good balance.  Also, I suspect they are the frozen variety and are not made in house.  Summer rolls are meh....  They're big, but again nothing special.  I've had the pho here and once again Pittsburgh disappoints me in the quality of pho that it has.  At Tram's, the pho bowl is small.  I don't expect a huge basin-size bowl, but a bowl of pho needs to have enough noodle, broth, herbs and spiced.  The meat is too overcooked for pho tai (pho with thinly sliced beef steak that is supposed to be cooked only when the boiling hot broth is poured in the bowl).  The taste is reminiscent of pho but isn't quite right.  You need to want to take your bowl and drink all the broth at the end of the meal and you should feel satisfied and be in a comatose state after a good bowl of pho.  This wasn't it.    That said, the service is nice.  However, I didn't feel too comfortable/relaxed eating here.  It was dark and crowded (and a little bit dingy).  I prefer dining at Pho Minh to satisfy my Vietnamese cravings.",

    "text": "Reading all the positive reviews here led me to believe that this was a great Viet restaurant. I was really disappointed. It's sad for me to say that even NYC pho was better than what I had here. The pho broth from Tram's was sweet. Yes, that's right - sweet, with barely any savory. And the cha gio (spring rolls) tasted a little bland and chewy, like it wasn't just freshly fried. The older gentleman (who I assume is the owner) was telling another set of customers that he used to have a restaurant in Vietnam before coming here. I don't know what he brought over but it didn't taste anything like what I grew up with. The menu itself is definitely affordable, but if they can't get the basics right, I doubt I'll come back here for anything else.",

I ordered fresh spring rolls and vermicelli and waited for 45 mins while other people (who came in after me) ordered and received their food before me. I almost walked out, but waited a few more minutes only to receive my order and chow down on the best Vietnamese food I've ever had.  Tram's is no joke. The fresh springs rolls come in orders of 2 with a ginger sauce and you can get tofu or shrimp, both are excellent. They're my favorite spring rolls in Pittsburgh, and after trying one you may agree too. The vermicelli (with pork) is my go-to entree. Noodles with been sprouts and coconut milk below a good portion of pork. Absolutely delicious.   On top of it all, the owners and operators are very personable and easy to talk to. Sometimes they'll crack a joke or tell you an interesting story, either way Tram's will leave you smiling!",

The broth had no depth and was quite bland, almost as if the boiling of the bones was done with only 30 minutes of cooking instead of 3 hours.  The meat were rectangular slabs of processed meat, as in Hormel Spam.  The vegetables were a few leaves of iceberg lettuce.  There was very little in the delicate blend of Oriental flavors.  This was a cheap truck-stop meal, prepared without love, using mass-produced and heavily-processed inexpensive food sources that one can get at Restaurant Depot by the case.  On the plus side, the bowl was a dollar less than at other Vietnamese restaurants in the city. But I think I will now pay that extra dollar and get some real pieces of meat.",

I also got the chicken pho with shrimp added. Most of the time when I order chicken pho, I pretty much expect the chicken to be a bit dry, or even completely dry. However, I still order it pretty often and my expectations have lowered. Tram's Kitchen has proven to me that it doesn't have to be like that! The chicken in this soup is perfectly cooked, juicy, and even still has a delicious fatty consistency. And the perfection didn't stop there. The shrimp were tender, perfectly cooked, and cleaned by a thoughtful hand. Broth is so flavorful and will warm the soul! This is comfort food that will perk you up no matter how rainy your day was. I also ordered the wonton noodle soup on another day, and it had delectably juicy thin slices of pork, with a satisfying broth. But if I had to choose between the two, I would recommend the pho as one of the best I've ever had!",

It was a very humble environment and very cute. The service was okay, they were really nice and never rude.   We ordered Pho (of course...), com tam, pad thai, and bun.

    "text": "Tram's is one of the best options for quick and healthy vegetarian/vegan food in the Lawrenceville area.  I am obsessed with the \"tofu and veggies\" (same item on the appetizer list and the noodle entree section)-- it is a cold dish with a piquant, vinegar-based sauce and lots of fresh herb leaves with julienned veggies and a well-cooked tofu with an excellent texture.  I crave this stuff.  It tastes so good that it's shocking how healthful it actually must be.  Other favorites are the spring rolls, the vermicelli with tofu and vegetables (hot dish with a different sauce and vegetables), and the pho soup.  The complaints in other reviews are spot-on: it is cash only and BYOB, a bit cranky and rushed service-wise at times, and not the most restful decor and interior (noise from tv and staff's children and dated plastic tablecloths/decor).  Don't let that stop you from going.",

The restaurant, which is owned and operated by a family of Vietnamese immigrants that left the old country in the early 1990s, is very down to earth and low key.  The service is primarily provided by Tram's father, who has one hand but somehow manages to seat, take your order, pour/refill your water, brings your food, clear the table and cash you out. He can be moody at times, but I have never found him to be rude even on a bad or busy day (he probably just doesn't have time for slowpokes who can't make up their mind). I would cut him some slack if he doesn't appear to be the most patient person in the world.   Parking in Lawrenceville can be iffy at times, but if you drive west a few blocks past Tram's there are usually many streetside spots. Cash only. BYOB.",

This is actually even more fun in my opinion because when you get take-out, they package all the ingredients up separately (noodles, broth, bean sprouts, basil, limes, chili, sauces, etc) so you can mix how you like at home!

My soup was full of broccoli, thinly sliced onions, mung bean sprouts, shredded carrots, and cilantro (YUM), and the broth was deeply flavorful.  It needed nothing extra.    However, I'm a fan of toppings, necessarily or frivolous, and Tram's did not disappoint.  In addition to the usual herbal accompaniments, every table was preset with a whole host of condiments to self-season your meal.  This tickles me greatly, especially for an eating experience such as pho.  Soy, hoisin, and oyster sauce, plus Sriracha AND sambal olek?  Tram's, I feel as though you get me.  And my huge bowl, half of which was boxed up for me to take home, set me back just $7?  YES, PLEASE.  Our friends ordered the beef and chicken soups with extra protein and were super pleased with how much extra meat they were given.  My fiance had the PHO HANOI SOUP and is excited to try the Saigon and Sate styles when we return.  Tram's is exactly what a pho restaurant should be.  Cheap, no frills, and unassuming.  Service wasn't super attentive, but my requests were honored ASAP when they were heard (extra jalapenos, please! and hot black tea--not on the menu but a much-appreciated basic).  This is a pho restaurant that makes me want to stop flirting with other pho restaurants and settle down.  This is the type of pho restaurant that makes me feel less depressed about summer ending, because at least cold weather equals soup weather.  I could eat this pho every week.

We jumped back on Liberty Avenue and kept heading northeast.  A few minutes later the wife's phone pulled up Tram's.  We parked right in front, and in we went, because I'll eat Vietnamese food, and especially pho, at the drop of a hat (and the wife will do so with not too much more prompting).    Tram's was a pleasant surprise.  For a Vietnamese place outside the big coastal metros, this one's older and mom-and-pop.  The decor isn't much to look at, and the only sounds were a blaring TV and a video-poker machine.  But the food was quite good:  By Vietnamese standards, the menu's pretty short, but there was basic pho with beef and meatballs that was rock-solid.  The broth had some depth to it, and the beef was done a bit differently:  Instead of the usual super-thin-sliced beef, this was almost like pulled beef, but tender and tasty.    The one-armed older fellow who waited on us is, I believe, one of the long-time owners.  Even though this restaurant has been around for some time, something got lost in translation with my wife's order:  She asked for the bun (vermicelli bowl) with tofu, but ended up with a vegetarian pho.  She pronounced it \"too healthy,\" which I take to mean bland, but for a vegetarian pho I thought the broth was quite rich and good.    The spring rolls were nice:  Copious fresh herbs, and a good value for the money.    All-in-all, good job, Tram's Kitchen.",

It was lunch rush, sure, but there were plenty of open tables. I didn't understand the urgency if there wasn't a line going out the door.  I hastily made a decision of pho while my sister got a dish he suggested, the curry chicken. Both dishes were great. I am not normally a curry fan, but the curry flavor was dulled with coconut milk. And the pho made excellent comfort food. Spring rolls are also awesome, although I prefer veggie over the regular pork ones.  Oh, and it's cash only. Ugh.  So yeah, there are some drawbacks, but probably one of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the city.",

Upon opening the door I was greeted by local event posters and a second door that lead me into the dining area. I am very use to Asian restaurants and don't expect waiting areas or bar areas to wait. 12 tables all with the same table cloth are visible with the typical Vietnamese condiments on them with small splatters on the wall behind them (so typical Imo). I glance at the unwiped menu and order one of my favorite summer dishes vermicelli noodle dishes with pork. After placing my order I notice 7 Best of Pittsburgh awards all seem pretty current. The wall art is a theme that rarely changes amongst Asian restaurants. After ordering my meal, 8 minutes passed and my noodle bowl appeared. It came with the sauce already at the bottom as some Vietnamese restaurants serve it on the side. It smells or delicious fried egg rolls, and mint. After the first few bites (with chopsticks) the flavor of lettuce soaked sauce, pork, and noodles consume my tastebuds and I am reminded why I love Vietnamese food again. The soccer game on the tv did not steal my attention, the owner and his father did by talking to the couple that visits often. They talk about the upcoming World Cup match and how they want France to win. They both agree as the receipt is handed to the customer. The aroma of bread is floating in the air and for a minute I say dream about my past experiences eating Banh Mi back in Denver.",

While the egg rolls were crispy and tasty, they really weren't anything special.  However, the pho was delicious!  A large portion (I had plenty left to take home for another meal!) of delicious, flavorful broth with good noodles and thinly sliced beef.

Food took about 10 minutes to arrive when it did the beef was already cooked through (that's a BIG no-no in my book). I could hardly make out the star anise in the broth, and the bean sprouts had seen better days. The framed PPG review says Tram's has the best Pho in Pittsuburgh; if that's actually True, then the state of  Pho in Pittsburgh is in bad shape.  I also tried the vegetarian satay that my wife ordered and it was pretty decent, so plus one star for having vegetarian soups, and more importantly, actually trying to make it good. It beat the pants off of the veggie Viet place on 6th st. in NYC. I kinda have my doubts about their interpretation of \"vegetarian\" though I kept that to myself...  As others have noted, the decor is kinda dumpy and the guy that took my order was surly, but I wonder if there's some kind of inverse halo effect going on here. Some hole-in-the-walls are just that: a hole in the wall.  Also: $8 for Pho does not make for hole-in-the-wall pricing.",

The broth was incredible- ridiculously hot (temp) with onions, just the way it should be.  The beef was probably too well done for my taste and was cooked all the way through when the soup was brought to me.  But it tasted just fine.  Only complaint was that the basil that came on the side wasn't very fresh.   Overall, it was great. Def going back.... and Tram is a nice guy.",

I was told by my sister-in-law who befriended him a long time ago that his family sided with the American's in the Vietnam war (perhaps this explains the arm, but I'm not sure). Most of his family took refuge in the states, but for some reason (not certain why) his daughter, Tram, was detained in Vietnam while the rest of the family trekked to the States. He opened up Tram's kitchen and then, eventually, Tram reunited with family in the states. Last I was there, the only two servers were Tram's father (wish I knew his name) and Tram, a father/daughter server team.",

Food highlights -     None that I can really think of.  The food is cheap.  Food cons -     The component that makes or breaks a bowl of pho is the broth.  It is the one thing that must be good for the soup to be enjoyable.  I've never had any hint of real flavor from the broth itself (before you add the plum sauce and the srirachia and basil and lime).

Then we had 3 different kind of pho for our main entree. We ordered a \"sate\" soup, a Saigon soup and a pho Hanoi soup. Only decent one was the pho Hanoi soup which isn't really like the typical pho. No beef tripe, tendon or beef balls in the soup and the noodles are fatter then what you'd find in typical pho. There was also excessive MSG in the soup dishes.",

It's not super clean, so what? Please name for me a spotlessly clean Vietnamese restaurant in the city of Pittsburgh. Seriously, take a spin through the alley behind Pho Minh in Garfield, *ahem* sorry in the Penn Avenue Arts District... Their backyard is like an open sewer... I've still eaten there and lived to tell the tale.  Point two: But for hipsters, it would not be in business.   Don't give yourselves too much credit, my friends. In the ancient era B.C.H. (Before Coming of Hipsters), Tram's still did a brisk business serving tasty if basic Pittsburgh-Vietnamese cuisine (they've taken the shimp curry over french fries off the menu, but you can still order it) to those who would brave the wilds of Lawrenceville (a distinctly unfashionable address, circa 1995) to get it. Did Tram's have all but a corner on the market at the time? Sure. Would people return if it was terrible? I would hope not.   As for the food, I am no student of Vietnamese cuisine, but the bun, or as it's billed here: \"grilled meat (why they don't just call it pork is a mystery, perhaps they're leaving their options open?) over vermicelli\" (pronounced \"ver-miss-eh-lee,\" by our esteemed host) is tasty and filling, as are the spring rolls. I can't comment on the pho as I have had too many inedible-mystery-tendon experiences at \"real\" Vietnamese restaurants in \"real\" cites to \"really\" be all that excited about the dish...   Long lives Tram's! Haters beware....",

A rule of thumb is a good ethnic restaurant will be swarming with that particular ethnic people.  When I went, all I saw were non-Asians.    Ordered the pho and it was mediocre and forgettable. It did not taste flavorful and authentic but maybe that's what is available in Pittsburgh.  Another sour note, they dropped off some spring rolls at our table.  It was our first time there and I thought they were complimentary so we ate them.  Later on, we saw them on our bill.  WE DIDN'T EVEN ORDER THEM.  They were overpriced, and not worth it.  Be careful if they drop off food or drinks at your table, they will bill you for it afterwards even if you didn't order it.",

Their spring rolls are easily some of the best of the Vietnamese variety in the area.  I find their pho to have small portions and to be of inconsistent quality.  If the I find the broth is good, they might ruin it by dumping a good 6 shakes of black pepper all over everything before they serve it (wtf?).  Other times, they might serve beef cooked well done as opposed to the rare which I prefer.  Or maybe they will give me my beef rare, except the broth will be so lukewarm that zero residual heat passes on to the beef.  Their spring rolls though are good.  Fresh and wrapped tightly, they help make the long wait time it takes for pho to be brought out more manageable.",

I told them that I didn't know which was my favourite, but I could tell you which was my least favourite: Tram's.   I don't even care about the decor or seating etc. Usually the best Vietnamese comes from fairly sketchy looking joints.   I had their \"Special\" noodle bowl which is their version of Bun thit nuong. It looked a mess. The spring rolls were cut up brutally and then everything was tossed in. Usually when you order this at other place, it doesn't come \"pre-mixed.\" Honestly, it looked like someone had already starting eating this. I thought to myself... \"Okay they have a different presentation style.\"   But as I ate, I was even more disappointed. They hardly put any fresh vegetables in it, and the vermicelli is overcooked. The spring rolls were completely soggy.   I don't think their menu is limited though, it seemed fairly typical. I don't know, maybe their Pho is better, but I'm already too disappointed to come back.  After reading other people's reviews and trying other Vietnamese places around the city and then having Vietnamese food in Toronto(at an average place), I'm throughly convinced that people in this city have no idea what Vietnamese food is supposed to taste like.  Oh and one last thing... do you actually believe that their food is vegetarian? I guess the joke's on you.",

I was immediately brought to the small street shops in Vietnam. Loved it and enjoyed that aspect.  Service was quick but lack luster. No real cordialness or small talk. Just sit, menu, and left. Spoke Vietnamese to everyone else in the back. Started yelling a lot too. If you've ever been to Vietnam you would know this is very typical of the restaurant world. Lots of bickering in the back and not a worry about what the customers think.  But let's get to the real important stuff, the food. I ordered the egg roll and spring roll to start. They were nothing special, of anything the veggies in them were a bit dry and old tasting. I also ordered the Hanoi pho as my main course. OMG! Loved it. So simplistic. This is True northern pho. The flavors, the ingredients, it was so simple and that's how it is over there because it is not full of expensive ingredients. It was pure in beef bone flavor, most other American restaurants go the extra sugary route, but that's understandable because it's to appeal that specific crowd. And unfortunately our American cuisine is packed with tons of sugar.   Besides, the point. Pho was good. I would definitely come back. I would also want to try the other dishes too.",

    "text": "After meeting two people who claim Tram's Kitchen to be their favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Pittsburgh, you know a place has to be good, right? Tram's Kitchen truly encompasses an authentic Vietnamese home, with the cheap plastic table cloths and Asian black art hanging on the walls.  We ordered the fresh spring rolls, vermicelli with coconut milk, and vermicelli with a mix of meats. A quick disclaimer: I grew up eating Vietnamese food so I have pretty high standards as far as Vietnamese food goes. So the food didn't really compare to what I'm used to at home. However, it was still pretty darn tasty. In fact, I now know three people who claim Tram's to be their favorite Vietnamese restaurant, the new addition being my husband. The food was fresh and flavorful, and the service was quick. I really felt a sense of family here too, oddly. Maybe it's because it reminded me of being at home.   Considering my husband is now obsessed with Tram's Kitchen, it's likely I'll be back very soon.",

The refill-able hoisen sauce tasted off. The vegetarian spring rolls were not like the other pictures i have seen.

The summer roll did look a little sad and like it wasn't the freshest ingredients, and the basil they provide on the side was also not that fresh. The broth for the soup was pretty good, but I wish they gave more noodles and that the pho itself was a little more flavorful.   The service itself is super fast, so you don't have to worry about waiting too long for food.   Regardless, if you're looking for some pho while in Lawrenceville, Tram's is your best bet.",

I always start out with fresh spring rolls. I think they could use a little bit more fresh herbs in there, but their dipping sauce is really good. I'm also a huge fan of the mixed/special vermicelli noodles. It comes with tons of grilled and shredded pork, a crispy spring roll, and veggies on the bottom. Always enough for two meals too.

I got the check, but no one came to break the change (cash only). I did some digging and found smaller bills. It's hard to assess as I'm sure they don't see many solo eaters.",

I ordered both which were delicious, as well as coconut vermicelli noodles. The pho had just the right flavour with a generous helping of greens and tofu in the broth. The spring rolls were great, and I believe filled with tofu skin as well as greens and vermicelli noodles. You can also order the spring rolls individually ($1.95) which I think is a plus. The dipping sauce was great! We also had the vegetarian wontons as an appetizer. Everything was fresh and came out very quickly!

Huge bowl of Pho with fresh veggies and a drink for under $10.   Cons: Parking in this neighborhood is a racket and restaurant doesn't have a lot.  Good to know: No credit.

Not that I've ever tried mind-blowing pho (I've only eaten it in Pennsylvania, which is probably the problem) but this was even worse than most.  However, I've since been back and ordered the bun. Now I was impressed! Specifically with the version doused in coconut milk--I love coconut anything, and on top of vermicelli noodles with a squirt of hoisin and sriracha, it was heaven. Only thing is, I don't like the selection of vegetables they use. Onions and broccoli just aren't my jam, and my favorite veggie to have with my bun, cucumber, was sadly MIA from Tram's version.  I do consider myself to be a little bit of a fresh spring roll connoisseur (ooookay, maybe not, but I eat them a lot), and Tram's are good, but not my favorite in the city. I know, a lot of people are all about Tram's rolls, but I like mine with lots of Thai basil, and you can barely taste it in theirs. They're still super fresh with a good amount of meat, so this is just a matter of preferences, not quality.  Regardless of the meh pho, I can't stress enough that it's totally worth it to come here for the coconut milk bun! Delicious!!",

By no means do I claim to know everything about Vietnamese cuisine or even anything more than a 'fan,' this is one place that when I make the 100+ mile trip to Pittsburgh, I will definitely stop to make sure I visit. Even if it's just for something to take home (Nothing beats cold Pho to cure a hang-over).",

I have to say, most of the items on the menu are not quite there yet, leaving much to be desired.  However, their Pork Banh Mi will be the thing that I'll always come back for. The key is their homemade mayo, oh man, that taste just like childhood in Vietnam. The pork is tender and seasoned to taste, the overall balance of ingredients is really what most restaurants here struggle with. Not to mention, the size is almost double than an average banh mi youll find anywhere else for the same or even lower price! God my mouth is wetering thinking about that damn delicious baguette!!!",

I've had some spring rolls where they use tiny shrimp which you can barely taste but Tram's stuff their rolls with big ones. I always love dipping it in peanut sauce and the ones that they make is definitely one of my favorites. I ordered their Pho Hanoi soup and there wasn't much I could complain about. I don't usually order rice dishes or other noodle dishes when I go to a pho place so I wouldn't have any expertise there.    * Cost vs. Worth: Their soups are around $11 each which is average for pho in Pittsburgh. Definitely worth the price!  Will I come here again? - If I ever crave pho now, I will probably think about Tram's.",

As I am originally from Bloomfield and only go back about once a year I said sure. Then I thought about Tram's and said that I saw them on Yelp and would love to go back there again. (It has been about 25 years since I was last there). Well anyway we went looking for Tram's and couldn't find it so I was like, \"I'm positive that it's here\", (Penn Avenue, close to Garfield.) Whelp finally I'm like \"there it is\", but it was all boarded up :( but alas after going on line again we found that they had moved about 15 blocks farther down on Penn Avenue closer to Lawrenceville. When we pulled up I was like, \"omg, really??? This used to be a pizza shop and I lived on the third floor for like a year 35 years ago!!!\". We came into Tram's, the owner was the same guy who owned the other one, and he looked EXACTLY the same as he did 25 years ago and I was like that can't be him but it was. So I asked him when they had moved to the current location and he said 22 years ago. I said did this used to be a pizza shop? He said \"yes\". I said, \"omg I lived upstairs on the 3rd floor about 35 years ago. TOOOO funny! They even go to St. Joe's Church. Blast from the past! Whew! Anyway, guy was super nice, fresh rolls were outstanding, and beef pho was on point. (Meat was a little on the fatty side though). Stuff like this makes me miss Bloomfield.",

I'm from Little Saigon in SoCal so my expectations are high and each pho restaurant in Pittsburgh satisfies my cravings in its own way. Currently, my favorite bowl of pho comes out of Tram's Kitchen. I love that I can order in Vietnamese and that the thit tai is tender and thin -- the slightly shredded quality of the meat is the best thing you can get for pho. Their broth is a bit light but thankfully not sweet, and thus I was not surprised they also offered fish sauce at each table for those who like saltier broths (I was a bit too hesitant to add more).   I will admit I snuck in an extra lime into the restaurant because I like a little more acidity in my pho.   Overall, I think their broth is the closest thing to Northern Vietnamese pho and they have the best eye round steak in this area.",

For example, the three of us ordered five spring rolls. Ten spring rolls were brought out. The manager begrudgingly returned five of the spring rolls. To avoid confusion again, the entrees were selected by actually pointing at them on the menu. The food arrived. It was woefully adequate. Most bun cha gio have fresh cucumbers , carrots, romaine, and other assorted veggies. Ours had none of that. My girl's pho was good but bland. But the worst part was that the restaurant actually charged us for the more expensive versions of the dishes, even despite our explicit selection. My frustration level prevented me from fighting the charges. So I resentfully paid and vowed never to return.   It is a shame. Pittsburgh's Asian ethnic food scene is very underrepresented in a city this size.",

    "text": "It's so odd that this place has so many  reviews and so many good ones at that because from my experience, it really doesn't live up to all the great reviews.   I moved to Pittsburgh for OT school, and the very first time we visited the city, my mom, little brother, and I were hungry, so I consulted yelp on finding a good place for Vietnamese food. It was our first time here, so I just picked the one with the most good reviews.   My family found our way to Tram's Kitchen, and the family who owns the place is very nice, but we were left soooo disappointed because the food was not good at all. Keep in mind that my parents have run asian restaurants and that my mom makes pho all the time, simmering the bone broth for days. We know good food. Tram's kitchen has nice people, but they do not have good food.   My younger brother got the summer rolls. Those are very easy to make and I frequently make them for myself. They're pretty hard to mess up, but the ones from Tram's seemed very old. The noodles and even the outer wrapping tasted as if they had been sitting out for days.   My mom got the rice and pork chop dish. This, along with pho, is a vietnamese staple, and we've had it many times. The rice was hard and the pork chop was extremely dry.   I got the pho dac biet, and just like the other dishes,it was such a disappointment. The broth was bland and rather cold, The meat looked like it had been shredded beyond repair.   We pride ourselves on being part of The Clean Plates Club, but we could not finish our meal. Maybe they were having a very off day when I went here, or maybe the people who have given them great reviews haven't had good Vietnamese food before. All in all, my family went to Tram's Kitchen hungry, and we left Tram's Kitchen still hungry but also very disappointed and sad.   PGH doesn't have a huge wealth of vietnamese places to choose from (I'm from east of Cleveland, and Cleveland's ChinaTown is full of great places), but if you're looking for a place much better than this one, head to Pho Minh in Bloomfield.",

Pho: I had their wonton soup and chicken pho. The wontons tasted very good, but I wouldn't go so far as to say they were memorable in any way. I would also say the same for the soup. I wish they provided basil, more limes, and more bean sprouts to add into the soup. Noodles were prepared very well and were definitely of the right texture.  Spring rolls: I wasn't a particular fan, perhaps because of my preference for what goes into spring rolls. With the hoisin-based sauce, they were satisfying.  Together, I'd say that the dishes i had above were good and satisfying but not memorable, simply because I've had so much Vietnamese food in southern California that I believe I've just had a greater selection of things that appealed to my preference. I would recommend if you're craving a light meal with south-east asian flavors but not looking for something to blow your mind.",

Tram is a gentleman who doesn't like it if you're not ready to order immediately when he comes to your table.  Because you only get about 2 minutes to look at the menu, the pressure's on when you sit down!  The food here is tasty and inexpensive.  The Pho is perfect on a cold winter day.  I'll agree with other reviewers that the spring rolls are delicious as well.  It gets pretty crowded during the weekday lunch rush.  Recommended if you're in the neighborhood!",

    "text": "If you grew up in a part of the country with lots of Vietnamese food or have eaten it in such places, you're not going to be impressed by Tram's.  I gave this place two tries and was disappointed both times. I will admit that I only tried the pho and a vermicelli bowl (on separate trips), but having ordered anything else on each of my trips would have put my bill in the neighborhood of $12+. Having grown up with cheap Vietnamese food in Texas, I wasn't prepared to spend that much for what's supposed to be a budget lunch, even with the understanding that I was going to leave hungry and that the lack of non-European ethnic diversity in Pittsburgh is going to automatically make things more expensive.  Either way, I don't understand the hype surrounding this place. The pho bowl was small, with a tasteless broth and child-sized portions of noodles and meat. After a few bites, I drenched the whole thing in Sriracha just to give it some flavor and to try to trick my stomach into feeling a bit more like I had eaten something.  The vermicelli was not so great either--a small portion of vegetables and noodles with a few too-thick chunks of pork that were not grilled long enough for any sort of darkness or crisp (but which still managed to be dry). The color of the dish was as bland as the taste.  As for the atmosphere, not a big deal for me. The restaurant is small, with minimal seating and some dinginess to it, but that's fairly common for older Vietnamese restaurants. Most diners are young, hip, and not Asian (which could be a turn-off for some due to the perceived lack of authenticity and/or hipsteriness). Parking is a chore; if you live nearby and choose to give the place a try, walk or ride your bike, or prepare to find yourself circling nearby blocks of permit-only parking.  Folks who dine at Tram's should keep in mind that cheaper, better, more authentic Vietnamese food exists out there. I grew up in North Texas (Dallas-Fort Worth area), where with one of the largest Vietnamese populations in the country, good, cheap Vietnamese food can be found all over the metro area. Pho portions down there are reasonably big, there are plenty of different meat combinations, and you can almost always choose the size of the bowl you want (usually kid's, small, large, and extra-large). Additionally, due to the presence of plenty of fresh ingredient suppliers and competition, prices are more in line with portion size, and the food is, more often than not, good. Most folks with normal appetites are able to leave satisfied having spent no more than $7 or $8 a person with tax and tip (compared to $20 at Tram's). Out of all the Vietnamese spots in North Texas that I've tried, my absolute favorite is Pho Pasteur, in Arlington: The pho, vermicelli bowls, crushed rice dishes, spring and egg rolls, and prices are all excellent. Tram's would be put out of business if anyone ever opened a restaurant like that up here.  If none of the other few choices in Pittsburgh are satisfying your Vietnamese food cravings, it might be worth it to take a weekend trip up to Toronto. You would also have access there to some other Asian foods that we don't have here, such as dim sum and Taiwanese \"small eats.\" For a slightly shorter drive, you can also find these things (though more sparsely) in the D.C. suburbs.",

    "text": "Food: Tram's is one of the True hidden gems in Pittsburgh and serves The best Vietnamese food the city has to offer.  Fans of Vietnamese food surely know Tram's by now, but those who haven't tried yet need to.  The menu offers appetizers, meat, seafood, and vegetarian options.  But there's no reason to order anything but the Pho.  There are many options, but keep it simple.  Pho real.  It's unbelievably tasty and filling.  One bowl will have you stuffed, but if you have a massive appetite, the spring rolls are also huge and delicious.    Price: One person can gorge themselves with tip included for under $10.  The prices here are ridiculous considering the quality and quantity of the food being served.  If you're on a budget, this should be a regular stop.  It should be regardless.  Drinks: the Thai iced tea is good, all regular drinks are offered, no booze  Atmosphere: If Tram's was to be criticized in any way, surely this would be it. The dining room is almost but not quite dirty, and likely hasn't changed in 10+ years.  What some may see as a blemish others may view as character (me).  Hey it's Tram's Kitchen, and we're just eating there.  Wear a blindfold, you'll still taste the remarkable food.  Cash only.  Service: A waiter will be to your table with water before you even hit the seat, and another will be over for your order within 60 seconds.  Thats why you just order the pho.  There's no wasting time at Tram's.  Sit down, order, food comes quick, bill shortly after, eat, go home.  (+): Tram's is a can't miss restaurant in Pittsburgh.  The only way to miss it would be driving past it without realizing because its so small and indistinguishable on Penn Ave.  The food and price are unbeatable.  (-): Some may be slightly turned off by the atmosphere.  Would I go back again? Routinely.",

You will find joints like this all over SOMA in San francisco, but not so much here in the 'burgh. Damn, are we lucky or what???!  I first ordered the Spring Rolls with shrimp, and they came out bursting with them! Two huge beautiful rolls. Patrick ordered the seafood pho, which was so bright and vibrant, delicious. And generous with the seafoods! It was the ocean in a bowl. I also ordered the lemongrass tofu appetizer- blown away! Perfectly lemon-y, nice texture and the best combo of salty and sweet. I dumped my peanut sauce all over it and chowed down like it was my last meal on earth. SO good!!!!!!  Service is prompt.

If it's so great there, STAY THERE! We don't want to hear it.  Nobody logs into Yelp and says \"Well, Tram's sucks, guess we have to go to BOSTON now to get Vietnamese food.\"   Now, the review.    I am a curry monster.  If a country makes a curry, I want to eat it, and once I've eaten it, I want more.  Not all curries are created equal, but the curry you get at Tram's is pretty damn good.  And that's why I go there, but it's not the only reason to go there.  The spring rolls are pretty good, as well.  What I like about them is that they're fat, and packed tightly.  You have to appreciate it, because it is no easy task to wrap one of those things really tightly without ripping the skin.  The service is sort of no-frills.  They're not overtly friendly, but definitely not rude either.  Just quick and businesslike.  I love the ambiance, too, because it reminds me a lot of east Asia.  Cheap tablecloths, pastel-painted walls, and until recently, it was organized in such a way that your table and the folks next to you were so close together you may's well have been dining together.  What's a real complaint about this place? It's what I say about every place that's cash only.  They need a credit machine.",

I don't expect anything fancy.  I got the pho tai, which was not bad. They filled up a big bowl and also had hosin sauce and whatever that red rooster hot sauce (whatever it's called) for the optional additional flavor. In comparison to some of the other pho that I have had, I didn't find the broth to be as flavorful. Everything tasted fresh, though.  We also got egg rolls and spring rolls. They were both good. I preferred the spring rolls.  Service was a little slow. We had to flag down our waiter, but that's not too big a deal. I also felt that the preparation could have been quicker, but I don't know jack about making Vietnamese food besides comparisons to other restaurants.  Overall, this place isn't bad, and I'd recommend you check it out if it's close by. My one friend recommended another place in Pittsburgh, but I can't remember the name and I'm too lazy to ask him. Maybe I'll update later and let you know. I'm a big help, right?",

With that, the Pho. It's amazing and I've had a lot of Pho. However, it has it hit and miss days too. The meatball is more tender and flavorful than the beef which can be dry or tough to some that haven't had Pho before. I wouldn't recommend any other versions. A small is available as most Americans I bring here are unable to finish a bowl.  Spring rolls are great (cold/fresh) with a peanut dipping sauce. The egg rolls are just amazingly full of flavor (fried) with a fish style dipping sauce. Place is very inexpensive too. Oh, this place is BYOB in terms of alcohol. Forgot to mention it's cash only.

So, when I came back to the 'Burgh for a visit he was all about finding a Vietnamese place in the city to get some more.   My parents and I had spent the afternoon in the Strip District, and enjoyed a few beers at Roland's before heading over to Tram's for dinner. We were hungry and the portions were huge, tasty and the reasonably priced. We decided to get three different entrees and all share. Obviously, we got the pho with beef, the fresh spring rolls, a spicy/bbq shrimp plate that came with white rice, and a vermicelli bowl with pork.   Everything was pretty tasty. The pho broth was a little salty for my preference, but it had a wonderful lemongrass aroma and taste. Also, usually I get fried or garlic rice with any rice dish I order from my favorite place in Cali, but the shrimp was very good and not at all over-coooked, as so many places do these days. The vermicelli dish was right on, and other than the fact that I prefer egg rolls to spring rolls, those were tasty as well, especially with the dipping sauce they provided.  I'd give this place 3 and a half stars. It was, overall, a good dining experience and service was quick, despite the neighborhood being a little sketchy and the inside being a little divey.   Also, a personal comment. I firmly believe pho is a miracle cure for the cold/flu. Anytime I get sick I head over to my pho place and order a huge bowl with beef and then add plenty of Siracha sauce. I always wake up the next day feeling like a million bucks.  So, if you're feeling sick (especially around this time of year) try it out. Even if it doesn't work for you, you'll still get some tasty food : )",

    "text": "Does this place have the best Vietnamese food I've ever had? No. But does it hit the spot? HELL YES!   This was our go-to for hangover pho in college. Coming back the Pittsburgh after trying countless Vietnamese resturants, I was afraid to try the food again. I thought that the great taste I remembered was more of a memory and lack of food savvy-ness than anything else.  However, Tram's did not disappoint. The rough-around-the-edges owner is still there, pumping out customers.  The pho lacked a little depth, but satisfied the craving. The portion was bit small for the price (Vietnamese is dirt cheap, even in NYC), but fine. The lemongrass tofu was a little on the salty side, but very tasty! The spring rolls, like everyone has mentioned, is packed with goodies inside.  My favorite dish of the night was probably the Split Rice dish. It comes with shredded and grilled pork and a lovely egg with runny yolk on top. The fish sauce that comes with it is sweet and delicious.  Hardly a wait on Saturday night? BYOB? I would be there every weekend if I was still in the 'burgh. One minus: cash only.",

    "text": "Very homely and no-frills feel for Vietnamese food. It feels quite authentic, at least to me. The menu is pretty straightforward, although some of the combinations and different prices may be a little confusing. There are mainly a few types of items--noodle soups, including pho, vermicelli (bun), and rice plates (con tam)--with a few varieties in each category. Overall their prices are quite reasonable, and it's only an extra dollar or two more to get combinations of different meats or spring rolls.  Having tried the pho, split/broken rice (con tam), and vermicelli (bun) bowl, I think their food is made well in general. The pho broth is very flavorful, and getting the different meats plus shrimp is very worthwhile. The vermicelli with shredded pork, spring roll, and grilled pork was very filling as well. If I had to pick something, I'd probably say that the grilled pork chop as served with the rice was my least favorite. It was a bit dry, and doesn't really compare to Tan Lac Vien. So I'd still stick with the latter for rice but maybe go here for pho.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Wednesday evening for dinner with my fiance.   We have both been to Tram's before but it has been awhile since our last visit.  Whenever we walked into the restaurant we saw that not much has changed except for maybe the addition of a flat screen TV.  The restaurant itself is small and maybe has seating at tables for about 30 people and the decorations are a little sparse.  The easiest thing to see is that they have won a ton of awards which are hanging up on the back wall.  Beyond that it is still a hole in the wall divey type of place that is cash-only with excellent food.     Almost immediately after we sat down the owner asked us if we were ready to order.  At that point we were not ready.  The menu here isn't that big but it doesn't need to be since what they do make is very good.  About two minutes later the owner was back and ready to take our order.  This time we were ready.  My fiance and I decided to split some eggrolls and then for my entree I went with the beef vermicelli with conconut milk. The eggrolls came out at the same time as the meals and were so hot temperature wise that both my fiance and myself left them until after we had eaten our entrees.  My vermicelli ended up being really good with the sauce providing the perfect flavor to the dish.  I don't know how they do it but they do a great job of infusing a ton of flavors into it.  The noodles in it were also good and the beef was better than expected.  After I had finished my vermicelli I ended up grabbing my eggrolll which was still somehow hot.  While the flavor on it wasn't that great, what I really loved about it was the textures that it provided.  It was cooked perfectly and so the shell had a great crispy exterior while the interior with the vegetables had a softer texture.  Overall it was another solid meal at Tram's for me.   The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back here again in the future.   Whats not to like about a place where the food is not only cheap but also delicious?  Just be careful in that it is cash only and I know at one point they were BYOB although I am not sure if that is still the case.",

We always start our meal with the fresh spring rolls - we both order two each because we don't want to share. Their hoison dipping sauce recipe includes special peanut ingredients that make it unlike any other that other Vietnamese restaurants serve. For dinner, I always order number 17 with no noodles because I substitute extra vegetables. It's always perfect. It's always delicious. I can't find this particular dish at any other Vietnamese restaurant so I continually find myself ordering the same thing. The pho is also delicious but I often times will share half an order with somebody else so I can get my number 17 :-)   The owner is a little abrupt but very friendly and you can bring your own bottle of just about anything and they will open it and serve it for you at no cost. You might be sitting next to a group of physicians, hipsters, corporate executives or students - they all flock here because the food is excellent and the price is always inexpensive.",

I walked in, and the decor was...pretty bad, but that's pretty run-of-the-mill for a chinese  restaurant.  Watermelons on the tablecloths, generic wall decor...whatever.  We ended up seating ourselves, I'm still not sure if we were supposed to or not, the staff wasn't very talkative, I'm assuming they didn't speak much english.  We both ordered the Beef Pho and Shrimp Spring Rolls.  So first major hiccup, our Pho came out, no sign of the spring rolls, though our waiter asked us \"You want any spring roll?\"  \"Yes.  Yes I do.\" -.-  Well we get our spring rolls, pretty good.  The sauce they brought out with it seemed like hoisin sauce with a pretty odd taste.  One piece of halved shrimp was all I found in the roll, which was a bummer, but it was cheap, so I'll let it slide.  The pho was great.  Nice aromatics, a hint of cinnamon, a decent amount of beef for the price, and a heaping plate of sprouts and limes to accompany it.  The only complaints I could pose were that it was very mild, and it a bit spicier.  Overall, above average, but my quest for the perfect Pho continues.",

    "text": "Was craving Pho while in Pittsburgh - and so on to Yelp I went and found the reviews for this place. So off I went in search of Tram's.  Tram's is located in a section of Pittsburgh that is a little on the run down side - the area has seen better days. But that did not phase me - adds some character to the place!  It was about 1:45 pm when I rolled in. Was given a choice of where to sit  - a little old man with one arm (or perhaps he was missing just the hand? - could not tell) took my order. He did not seem to friendly - I asked him a couple of questions and it was hard to get anything out of him.  I ordered Pho Ga with white meat (although their menu lists it as \"Pho Hanoi\") with garden rolls and a glass of water.  I suspected that perhaps their approach to Pho was going to be more Northern Vietnam based on the name for the soup - and I was partially correct. When the soup came out - the noodles were the slightly wider ones rather than the very thin ones.  Now I'm guessing that many of my Yelp friends from the DC area that like Pho would not have liked the Pho here.  Unless I'm mistaken - most of you folks seem to prefer to have all of the fat skimmed and strained out of your Pho broth - which I am against. It makes the broth to clear and light and there is a significant reduction in flavor and richness when this is done. And they certainly weren't doing that here. In fact - there was a slight oiliness or greasiness to the broth - but not overly so. It gave the broth a delicious richness and subtly in flavor that was just so damn good!  I added all of the aromatics and veggies. I will say that the amount of Basil, and the quality of the Basil were the low points of the meal. The poor Basil had seen better days.  I then tasted the broth and was floored by how good it was. I detected light, rich hints of star anise and cinnamon, which when combined with chicken essence fat globules and onions - was just outstanding. Rich, savory, wonderful!  I added Sriracha sauce to individual bites of food as I went - and only added a little to the broth at the very end. I really wanted to savor the broth the way it was.  Cons: - The rolls were not very fresh - in fact I did not finish them because they weren't very good. - The Basil was not crisp and fresh - The restrooms need to be gutted and retrofitted  So I'm only docking them one star for the cons - the Pho was outstanding IMHO - so four stars overall!  Cash only - no credit cards. I had a bit of a hard time finding parking - so beware of that.",

The wife and I decided to stop by before an Unblurred Friday on Penn Avenue.  At around 5:30-6pm on a Friday, the place was pretty slow, but that didn't last very long.  By 7pm there was a line of people waiting to get in (there isn't a waiting area, so it seemed most people just waited outside until a table would leave).  We decided on spring rolls, pho and the highly regarded pork noodles.  Spring rolls - these were the star of the show.  Plump, crisp and plenty of flavor.  Pho - the broth itself was some of the best we've had in Pittsburgh, but the rest of the soup really didn't live up to the same standard  Pork noodles - not too bad...  the pork was great, but there was barely any of it on top of the noodles (maybe a better portion would have changed our thoughts)  The owners seemed nice and a bit overworked due to the crowd.  Overall, we're definitely glad we tried it, but I can't see us going back.",

I enjoyed the fried egg roll way more, but I wouldn't discourage someone from trying Tram's fresh spring roll.  For dinner, I had the Vermicelli noodles with coconut milk and beef. It was sweet and savory, but it missed a kick of spiciness to counter the coconut milk. I asked the staff for crushed red chili pepper flakes, but there was a significant language barrier which impeded me from conveying my request. Eventually, I said pepper enough, and I was brought jalapeno peppers. Not quite what I was looking for but they were an acceptable alternative.  The only subpar point of the night was the difficulty with service. The cash only policy could have been trouble; luckily, I read some reviews beforehand which prepared me.

Not sure how the people who have given it negative reviews could arrive at their conclusions, but hey, everyone's entitled to his/her opinion, right?  Everything I have ever ordered here has come fast and fresh. Spring Rolls are a must, and can be made a meal unto themselves. Chicken fried rice is astounding. Vermicelli dishes are a great treat in the warmer months (because they come at a cool temperature, and are almost salad-like), and the chicken pho is transcendent.  Yes, transcendent.  I yearn for the cold months because it means that I can eat the stuff - my wife at first was horrified that I referred to chicken pho as the best broth based food I had ever eaten. Hell, she even made fun of me for craving 'chicken soup,' which most people would simply make at home, but this is not like anything at home, this is the ultimate comfort dish. The beef pho is good, but their chicken version is simply the best.  I know that they had some problems with their accreditation, but that appears to be well in their past, and frankly, I never had a single problem with their food before that. (That's more than I can say for many other restaurants I've been to...)",

The lemongrass tofu is another superb item, as well as the fresh spring rolls. Don't forget to specify vegetarian or you'll get pork or shrimp in things. \"Mr. Tram\" as I call him (Tram is actually his daughter) is really the heart and soul of the place, he is missing one hand and has a gruff demeanor but has a real genuine way about him, and we've loved eating at his place over the years. A good owner can make a restaurant really special.",

    "text": "I haven't had Pho since I moved to Pittsburgh, partly due to the lack of ethnically diverse cuisines here. But I must say that this place does a good job in bringing one of my favorite comfort foods.  Although the broth isn't super rich and deep, it still has lots of flavor. In fact, I like how light the broth is and how it isn't heavy. I had the Shrimp Pho, which was delicious; the shrimps were also tender and not overcooked. The serving size was pretty big too, so  you get your bucks' worth.   Bean sprouts, Thai basil, onions, and lime wedges are served alongside as add-ins when you order soup based dishes (Cilantro is already added to the soup). However, I noticed that these garnishes were a bit limp and dry, not fresh.  The spring rolls were a nice start, but I would say that it's a bit dry. If you're sensitive to cilantro, do not order it, because it comes with a good amount inside.  Also, this place is CASH ONLY, so come prepared.",

It's definitely one of the better tasting pho broths that I've had in pho around Pittsburgh. Noodles were alright, what one would expect in a dish like this. Not too floury, but also not too thin (to the point of falling apart). The pho also came along with a dish of bean sprouts and basil. I mostly used the bean sprouts, which came fresh. In general, I found it to be relatively satisfying. I'll have to come back sometime to try some of their other offerings, but so far a good first impression certainly helps.",

I don't need Tram's to be impressive in its appearance because I realize it has been and always will be a family run restaurant. It's about the food, and the food here nails it every visit.   I've read reviews commenting on the service, which there is some truth to the level of character presented in the service. Speaking of which, don't stare at Tram, I'm sure he's well aware of the fact that he's missing an arm. Does that get in the way of the delicious food? Not one bit. Don't think that he doesn't understand you either, don't be ignorant. I just heard a woman almost yelling at him.   The food is great, just try something that sounds good to you. The decor will fade from your mind as you and your companion(s) get a taste of Vietnam in Pittsburgh. Try the fresh spring rolls, better than the egg rolls. I also recommend the vermicelli and coconut milk with shrimp. The pho, curry, and mung bean noodle soup are also wonderful. At the price point of Tram's you can eat here often and eventually try everything.   Oh yeah. It's cash only. That makes me like it even more. No separate checks!",

From there, people who were seated after us, had their food before we did. They had a very similar order to ours. Then, when I did receive my food, the man hovered near me and then started pouring sauce onto my plate, telling me how to make my pho. I know how to make it!

The fresh spring rolls were brough out within a minute so it seemed more like it was premade. Pho comb didn't have the usual beef  ingredients and the slices of beef weren't too fresh, because the color was brownish instead of pink. The noodles were very chopped up as well. I understand every restaurant has their own style but this is definitely not my favorite. The check was place to my table when I was still eating, and it was CASH ONLY. An ATM was right outside and of course I have to pay charge fee to take out cash. The most unacceptable thing is that they charge extra for having the meat outside, like who does it?!!? Just like McDonald charges extra for buying 2 burgers and pack it in 2 separate bags. WOW!! Unbelievable! Personally I won't go there ever again. I think I still like the Vietnamese place on strip district better.",

The cold spring rolls were the only decent thing we had - they tasted very fresh.  The peanut sauce served with them was mediocre. Maybe it was an off night for them.

Their spring rolls are a must, as is their Saigon soup.  This place is BYOB and no reservations are necessary.  Cash only place.",

    "text": "I do have a special place in my stomach for Tram's kitchen and I try to eat there every now and again.  Pho is a good meal to warm you up in the winter and this place is a great place to stop in for a yummy dinner.  I have been a little wary to go off the beaten path of the spring rolls and the Pho, so I got the spring rolls and the chicken peanut soup (I think that is what it was called).  It was very close to the chicken Pho, except it had less noodles, more veggies, and a little different twist on the sauce with some crunched peanuts that settled at the bottom and a bit more spice.  The dishes definitely didn't disappoint.  The parking is on the street (which is usually pretty empty after working hours), and the ambiance seems to have perked up a little bit with what I think is a new coat of baby blue paint and some new flowery table cloths.  Don't worry though, the mother of pearl wall art is still there, and your chances of not understanding your server is still high.  The prices are cheap, the grub is good, and the place is uh... rustic, oh yeah, and bring cash!",

    "text": "Like a couple others, I'm really not sure what all the fuss is about this place.  I moved to Pittsburgh from Seattle where you can find some of the absolute best Vietnamese food.  This place is a hole-in-the-wall with a very brusque owner/waiter and kind of dingy decor.  I don't mind any of these things actually, but the food I definitely took some issue with.  I ordered a tofu-veggie dish (can't remember the name) served over rice.  My boyfriend ordered the pork rice vermicelli bowl.  Our food came fast enough and it was served hot.  However, my dish was nothing to brag about.  It was pretty average tasting Asian fare.  It didn't taste bad by any means, but not restaurant quality.  Good thing it was only about 6 bucks.  My boyfriend's dinner was a real disappointment, however.  My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Seattle had HUGE vermicelli bowls with absolutely fresh lettuce and onions, piled high on top of perfectly cooked noodles.  The meat/tofu you ordered with it was never sparse and it was cooked to perfection.  Everything was doused with some sweet fish sauce and presented with some sliced egg roll.  The pork vermicelli that came to my table did not resemble this at all.  It was served in a rather small bowl with just a few pieces of lettuce and onion.  The \"pork\" that was on top amounted to about 1/4 of a cup of weird texturized, shredded something.  It almost looked like boiled ground beef.  I felt sorry for my boyfriend because he had never eaten Vietnamese food before and I had recommended a vermicelli dish to him because they are (usually) delicious.  As a double whammy, his dish was about 9 dollars!  Neither of us were full when we were done with our meals, so we ordered some spring rolls, which were supposed to be what they are famous for.  I don't understand this either.  The rolls were extremely bland and chewy.  The sauce that was served with it didn't do much to save it.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this place and I will continue my search for good Vietnamese food elsewhere.  Also, please take note they only accept cash and no cards.",

    "text": "CASH ONLY!!! Due to work being called off because of loss of electricity I thought i would take this opportunity to venture to Trams.  When i arrived i was the first and only one there.  I was expecting to see many different types of PHO on the menu, but there was only one line with PHO on it.  This made it easier for me to make my decision even though the vermicelli bowls were tempting.  I also ordered two spring rolls.   The spring rolls came out and they were much bigger than i was expecting.  They tasted fresh, crunchy and filled with goodness such as shrimp, pork, noodles, and herbs.  I dipped them in a chili sauce as well as a brown sauce to complete this delicious experience.  The only negative of my meal was I ordered chicken and shrimp pho and ended up getting Beef pho.  I am guessing i confused the server/owner while i was ordering.   I didn't bother to complain since i figured he wouldn't understand anyways, so i began to consume my pho.  Every aspect of the dish was perfect from the noodles, to the beef to the sprouts that I got to dunk in every so often.  My meal ended up costing $14 without tip and was worth every penny.  By the time I left every table was filled.  Cant wait for our next February Tropical Storm.",

I always get the fried tofu and the chicken salad (goi ga). Shrimp curry is good too.  The place is run by a single family.  Waiter (one armed man) is a little short at times (my wife claims that he is always nicer to me than to him. She calls him the \"food nazi\") but he is much better when the place is not so packed.",
