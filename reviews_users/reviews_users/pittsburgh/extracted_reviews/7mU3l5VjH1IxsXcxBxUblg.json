One small recommendation: I think it would be awesome to have some TVs put in the dining area showing Telemundo Spanish soap operas. I cannot get enough of the drama.",

You have to have that special pizazz in your pico, zest in your mex, taste in your taco....you get the point!    Coming here there's no kick, no punch, not even a wimpy slap in the face.  I agree with Beth M, it's just bland.  I ordered a chicken burrito and the chicken was that stringy kind you get in a can.  They had to have stuffed the whole can in because all I could really taste was bland chicken with a little bit of lettuce, tomato, etc.  The rice and re-fried beans were exactly the same.  No real taste.  I was pretty disappointed in everything BUT....  FREE CHIPS AND SALSA!    I get pretty bitter when chips and salsa aren't offered for free, so this was the only plus.  I scarfed down enough to make myself not as bitter about the food.  So maybe stop in for the chips and salsa....you'll potentially look cheap...but hey, the food should be better!",

I would say typical Mexican restaurant.  Decor looked a little like a cross between lower end dining of Chipotle and higher end restaurant. Service was friendly and quick. There is outside seating but none available when we stopped. Would be nice to sit outside.  Beer and margarita specials. We ordered guacamole which is made to order table side. A little on the pricey end with 9.99, but it is pretty big and chips are complimentary. Very good guacamole! I could probably have eaten this and the chips and salsa for me meal.  I ordered the chimichanga cancun which is with shrimp and their cheese sauce. This was really good and huge. Comes with rice and fresh lettuce, pico de gallo, sour cream. I took more than half of this home. Friends had same and chicken chimichanga. All was really good. Priced fairly for portions and the service was excellent. Place was very busy.  All in all it was decent Mexican food. Don't eat beforehand as you'll be stuffed when you are finished.",

I dined here most recently on Friday night with friends and ordered a margarita and chicken quesadilla. The margarita was all right, but I believe that Mad Mex serves up a much tastier margarita. The chicken quesadilla was pretty tasty, though I personally prefer slices of chicken to the shredded chicken in these quesadillas. Our waiter was nice enough but could have offered better service. Our chips and salsa were quickly eaten but never replaced, and I was never offered a second margarita. Overall, I don't dislike this restaurant but would select to dine at a Mad Mex instead any day.",

I like food that reminds me of what my great grandmother would make and he likes Tex-Mex (anywhere that puts cheese on their tacos) Emiliano's seemed like a good compromise. He ordered the shrimp taco salad and I got shrimp Vallarta. We also shared some guacamole. The guacamole was good and made table side. My boyfriend's salad looked pretty tasty to me but he was not impressed. The shrimp Vallarta was extremely disappointing. It tasted like a plate of shrimp covered in ketchup. I know that the sauce should have a similar taste profile because of the ancho and vinegar. But, this was almost as is if they cooked shrimp and poured a bottle of sacred Heinz all over. It was not good.",

It doesn't matter who you have, they will make you feel at home. And the food? I've had everything on the menu, and I've never been anything less than amazed. A perfect blend of traditional Mexican food and Tex Mex, Emilianos is top of its class. Let's not forget their drinks, though. Their fabled margaritas were not declared Pittsburgh's best without reason. Their homemade mix is paired with a generous helping of silver tequila. If you're feeling particularly ambitious, try their sangria margarita (also made in house). Every day gives you the chance to try something new, with a daily drink special that undercuts most other restaurants by a few valuable dollars. Overall, 150/10!! I can't wait to go back tomorrow, and the next day, and the next day, for more!",

The prices are very reasonable and you can get a 32 oz dos equus for $8 or a tasty olympic swimming pool sized margarita fishbowl for just a little more.  I'd come here for drinks any time, but I'd save my appetite for somewhere more deserving.  It's reasonably priced, but very processed and definitely not made from scratch.  Everything is very salty, but lacking in any other kick or flavor.  We got the sampler platter, and despite the fact that it had 6 different things including burritos, tacos, enchiladas, and tamales on it, they all tasted bland, processed and virtually identical.  Nothing here was bad, but it never ventured into the great zone either.    Bland food, great service and drinks.  Come thirsty, not hungry, and you'll have a wonderful night at Emilianos!",

Terrible customer service.  There are way better businesses on the south side with much better service than this place.",

    "text": "I would give Emiliano's 15 stars if I could! I can't say enough good things about this establishment.  To start, their staff is the best around. Exceptionally personable. Not many places are enthusiastic about serving a table of 7 that include 3 toddlers and a three year old- Emiliano's always is! Yep. Not just nice. Enthusiastic about our presence and light hearted about the kids being kids. We've gone more than once for lunch with our crew and they're always happy to see us. And laugh whenever our kids do something ridiculous and I assure you, they do.   As for the food.  And drinks. Oh. My. Goodness. It is delicious. It's hard to review Emiliano's because the menu has so many amazing things happening.   To start. The fajitas.  They're filling. This is a real fajita.  An abundant amount of meat is served with grilled veggies of your choice. My personal order is chicken with peppers. No onion.  My dad orders the Emiliano's specialty fajita. This is when you add bacon and cheese to your fajita. I haven't tried it but he swears by it.   Platters- so good. Filling. It's hard to choose which is best. The Mexican chicken is a spicy chicken that's extraordinary. Serves with beans and tortilla it's a meal everyone should order once if you enjoy heat.   Make your own combination- yay! Always a favorite. Deciding what to order at Emiliano's is almost impossible. Especially after you've sampled multiple items. How can one decide what to get? Well order the combination meal and you can put together your own combination. Oh the endless choices.   I could write a 20 chapter novel just on Emiliano's Combination strategies and reviews. Here would be my highlights- to start. The staff is patient and will answer questions. So ask away.  I always order chicken options. So I love the tacos! All of the Enchiladas are awesome!",

I'm happy with my experiences at Emiliano's and typically make it my go-to option for lunch when I'm at the SouthSide Works.",

Now, 9 years & a lot of tacos, quesadillas & fajitas later- I can tell you that this place is pretty mediocre. Sure, it's not terrible- but it's not going to blow you away. On my most recent trip, my family and I all order a margarita to start. It was good- but nothing different or special. The presentation wasn't anything different & I had no desire to order another. The chips & salsa were good- Probably my favorite item of the evening. I ordered the steak fajitas for dinner. The chicken & steak fajitas were both $14, so I figured I would go for the steak. They were good- but not great. Nothing memorable. If I want Mexican, this is the absolute last place in Southside that I am going to visit- there are more authentic & less commercial places on East Carson & their prices are a lot better as well.",

Although the location is great, the food was mediocre. We both got the Enchiladas Supreme, which we read were good. Basically, you get two small enchiladas (one chicken, one beef), rice, and a \"salad.\" I put salad in quotation marks because it was basically iceberg lettuce with a little tomato salsa and some shredded cheese sprinkled on top. They could definitely work on making that more of a side dish and not an afterthought. The rice was good though, and there are free chips with salsa, which I thought was the best tasting part of the meal. The lunch was about $10, including tax and tip, so not a bad deal. Since they had good (and free) chips and salsa, I'm giving this place three stars, but probably will not be going back.",

That being said, this is 1 of the BEST Mexican restaurants that has graced itself upon the Pittsburgh area!!! It is authentic as it gets, delicious every time, great service (we get the same wonderful waitress every week, Natasha), beautiful decor, great drinks & just a relaxed ambiance. I've been to them all, a lot of 5 star restaurants in and around the area and nothing compares to Emiliano's! I would chose this place over Morton's, Ruth Chris or Monterey Bay almost any day! This is in my honest opinion a True Pittsburgh Gem and is 1 of the only True Mexican Restaurants in the Pittsburgh area. Mad Mex is a bunch of tex mex garbage, El Campesino's is unsanitary (look for annual write ups in the Post Gazette on El Campy's). The only other Mexican Restaurants that can hold a match to Emiliano's would be Patrons in Wexford or the Franklin Inn on Rochester Road (North Hills) (although is not authentic Mexican by any means but still very good!). So, please disregard the nay sayers or the Debbie downers and check this place out - I have never been disappointed in all my years and I believe you won't be either : ) Enjoy!",

Now that that's out of the way I would like the management at this place was absolutely horrible (that's the main reason for the lower score).  I visited this restaurant on Cinco De Mayo and obviously this place was packed (that's understandable).  The day prior a friend of mine called to see if there was any specials going on during the day of the visit and they told her there was $4 Margaritas and $1 Dos Equis bottles.  Awesome.  Upon arriving I was told that this wasn't True (by the manager) in a very condescending manner and that another special (advertised on a chalk board outside of the restaurant) was not in effect either.  At first the manager didn't even believe that the special was advertised on the chalk board until a friend of mine actually showed him at which point the manager said the only special was $4 margaritas.  There were other points of misinformation presented that I won't go into but suffice to say that I won't ever go back here again and not on the account of the food (which was excellent) but the management.",

The first time I went was on a Sunday during lunch with 4 other friends. We sat outside, because the weather was nice and the street view was pretty. The service was slow even though it wasn't too crowded. Our server was friendly albeit slow. We were given free chips and salsa while we waited, but there was only a small bowl of each placed on the table . The chips were good, but too small for our group. After we had about one chip each we were out of salsa and had to ask for more. When the runner finally arrived with our food the table was almost too small for all of our stuff, but we made it work. The food was hot and looked great. Two of us got the \"Build Your Own Combo\" with one of each enchilada, burrito, rice, and sweet potato fries. I remember the others ordered the Choripollo Taco Stand, Enchiladas Suizas, and Emiliano's Fajitas. We all enjoyed our food and were very full when we finished. The rice was very good, neither overcooked nor under-cooked, and my burrito and enchilada were your standard pseudo-Mexican fare (super cheesy and yummy). My friends also enjoyed their meals and the reasonably priced mojitos and fishbowl margaritas were tasty.  My second trip there wasn't so great. It was during the weekday and before the dinner time rush so my friend and I were seated outside quickly. Our waitress was not only slow, she was also very clumsy (dropping our menus twice, spilling water and salsa, and bumping into our table). She was friendly enough and repeatedly apologized so we chalked it up to her having a bad day. Again we both got the \"Build Your Own Combo.\" I got the taco, tamale, rice, and sweet potato fries. My friend chose the taco, burrito, soup, beans ,and fries. When the food arrived I swear the plate was hotter than my entree and the cheese was barely melted. The fries were over-cooked, the tamale was too mushy and hard to eat (I literally had to force it down) and my friend said that her taco was one of the grosses she has ever had. The rice was palatable and my friend really enjoyed her soup. The waitress was so slow in bringing our checks that we decided to just pay cash to avoid waiting for her to return our cards. After this experience I have avoided going back.",

The server was OK, not great. Our drinks came out sporadically instead of all together which was REALLY annoying. When she finally took our orders, my husband asked for his steak medium rare with the sauce on the side due to his \"heat/spice\" sensitivity. My brother asked for his burrito to be covered in queso, which he repeated many times so she understood. Food arrives, my husbands food is covered with sauce, no queso in sight for my brother. Get the server who goes to get the queso and take back my husbands meal. Second steak arrives and he asks the guy that brought it to stay while he checks to make sure it's cooked correctly since it arrived so quickly. The person did not understand a word he was saying and just kept smiling and backing away. The steak was burnt on the outside and RAW, not rare, on the inside. Then, I found HAIR in my food. GROSS!! YUCK!! SICK TO MY STOMACH!!! We were explained the situation to the manager and asked for the bill as we were going somewhere else. He apologized and then handed me a $40 bill for our drinks!!!!! After HAIR IN MY FOOD and not one, but two incorrect meals for my husband the least he could have done was comp our drinks which we didn't even get to finish due to having to try to find another restaurant at 6:30 on a Saturday night!!!!",

    "text": "We wanted to try a traditional Mexican restaurant for the first time since moving to Pittsburgh from Phoenix.  Emilianos won the lottery!  The restaurant was open and clean.  We were seated right away at around 5:30 PM on a Saturday.  The chips and salsa were tasty (we love the traditional thin tortillas).  My wife ordered a sangria and I ordered a regular margarita.  Both were tasty and strong!  Wifey ordered Camarones Vallerta - we both loved it...especially the sauce.  I had fish tacos (I'm obsessed with them).  I was hoping for baja style (avacado, cabbage, pico, etc.), but they were just fried fish on tortillas with some side fixin's.  Overall, decent experience.  We will try again some day...",

Free chips and salsa for all, did anyone mention that? OF COURSE THEY DID because it is very nearly a phenomenon in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Can we get the Mexican Restaurant League of Carbohydrate Advocates on this? What is the deal?) I myself was seduced by their incredibly sensuous (yes) guacamole, which goes for only 2.99 a bowl, as opposed to the national mean of 4.99 (Christine-generated statistics. I've been to Texas. And California. Hey!). It was amazing. I almost ordered it again, but then I saw churros sticking out of a martini glass filled with ice cream and was intrigued...but then I ordered flan with ice cream because I wanted to try the homemade flan instead. The flan itself was not the texture I am used to...it was more like extra firm tofu, but the caramel sauce was caramel-y? I had a chicken fajita from my neighbor's plate and it was good, but I thought perhaps they could benefit by making their own flour tortillas? Always fluffier, always impress in a Mexican restaurant. Prices are on the steeper end, but, once again, must be a Pittsburgh thing (what is the DEAL?). Next time I will be going straight for the sangria margarita I've heard so much about, and laying waste to more chips.",

Despite the prices on most of the menu being more than $12, the lunch versions were very well priced, and comparable with much cheaper-tasting food and atmosphere (like Qdoba, around $8 a person including soft drink). We ended up not using the entirety of my $25 gift card, which was not what I was expecting.  We both had quesadillas, and were both extremely happy with their taste, as well as the freshly made free appetizer chips and salsa. The rice was cooked well, which is something that I've never encountered at a Mexican lower-priced restaurant before.  Our waiter was actually Mexican (authentic Mexican cuisine?), and very helpful and polite. Will definitely be going back for lunch some time.",

I showed up for the pitchers of margaritas and ended up nibbling on my friend's refried beans and I tried mole for the first time. I wasn't a fan of mole and that's okay it wasn't mine to like but when I ordered churros I half expected to just get plain churros with cinnamon and sugar and was happily surprised with something else! I try churros every time I'm not hungry but want something to nibble on at a Mexican restaurant and these are by far the best I've ever had. I usually don't like churros that are filled but this is the exception.  I felt like I was in a churro inception because the more I bit into the churro dessert the more churro I discovered swimming in a pool of the creamiest of ice cream. It all made me feel like a big kid and all the noise surrounding me was gone. I didn't even notice the other people at the bar eyeing this decadent dessert but I did share it with my best friend who discovered that I really like churros since I order them everywhere I go. This dessert and the two and half hour wait sealed the deal for me. I will be back to try the rest of their menu and to conquer the churro delight.",

    "text": "Reviews seem a bit mixed for Emiliano's, although having been here twice I found my experience to be pretty consistent so far. Came both times on a weekend night, and it was at least 85% or so full. There was about a 5 minute wait each time, which was very reasonable. Chips (warm!) and salsa were provided as soon as we got the table, and our orders were promptly taken.   The fajitas were definitely the stand-outs in the menu and just looking around the restaurant, with savory sizzling plates being brought out to the tables every so often. The thing was that you could smell them from across the room, a huge motivation for ordering one. The sampler was perfect to share, with so much food that no appetizer or side was needed. The plate came loaded with different meats and shrimp, plus a lot of sweet onions and bell peppers on the base. The carnitas and shrimp were done pretty nicely both times, while the chicken might have been a bit on the dry side (but still very tasty). The steak was definitely a highlight--oftentimes, fajitas are ruined with the steak being too well-done, but this was not the case here. Instead it ended being juicy with a bit of tenderness and lots of flavor.  The standard sides of rice, refried beans, salad, and tortillas also came with the fajitas. They're probably more of a one-person serving, but that was fine with us seeing how many things were on the fajita plate. While this is not Texas, I do think that this is the go-to place for Tex Mex in the city.",

On top of really poor service, the food was very underwhelming. Margaritas tasted like overpriced fruit juice. The queso dip was unusually small. The other order of chili con queso was just beef, no queso. My friend ordered double rice and her portion looked like mine which was only a single order.

They are so good! Their margaritas are a really good deal! You get a huge margarita for a good price especially when they have a happy hour deal. Not only do they have deals on margaritas but other drinks as well. Emiliano's is definitely a place to try when you are down South Side!",

Suggestions bring food out when it's ready don't wait for all meals to be done if it's going to become cold! I might try again but not a priority!",

If you like middle-of-the-road Tex-Mex, prepared for the tastes of white people in Northern Rust Belt cities (and I am not embarrassed to say that, once in a while, I do)...then this place is for you.  Just check your expectations before you enter...  It really reminded me of eating at Chi-Chi's back in the day. I had some nachos with refried beans that tasted like the beans came right out of the Ortega can.  It was topped with shredded iceberg lettuce and the dish was lined with American cheese.  Like the kind that comes wrapped in plastic.  No queso Oaxaca or nopales here, but the chips were good and I ate it all.  And it was good.  I had fish tacos for my entree, which were OK as well, though the sauce was a little bland.  (I think it was French dressing).   The margaritas tasted like they came straight from some prepared bottled mix.  It was kinda what I was in the mood for....and judging by the Southside Works area, which is filled with crappy chain experiences of every shape and size, it is what I was expecting.",

Like most typical Mexican restaurants, you get chips and salsa, but what makes Emiliano's special is that they prepare foods in front of you. I ordered the Holy Guacamole and Queso Fundido and not only were both delicious, but it was very entertaining to watch them make it. And the cherry on top...The staff is very pleasant and prompt, so it's not like an awkward encounter at your table.   So far, I've liked everything I've ordered there. The prices are reasonable (including drink prices) and the portions are very decently sized. You will leave stuffed!",

We walked in early one friday afternoon, only one other table besides ours was occupied. There were 3 waitresses on staff that day yet we waited to be seated. We ordered one beer each and finished it before our meal came. Someone from the kitchen brought it, and our waitress was over at the bar wiping the same spot for 15 minutes and zoning out. Never came to check on us or get us refills until I flagged her down about 10 minutes after we finished to ask for our bill. THEN she asks if we would like a refill. But let's not forget the stink eye she gave when she saw her tip. Sorry sweetie, maybe you should have tried earning it. You're lucky you got anything at all.",

    "text": "Ok yelp nation if you read my review if The Round Corner Cantina, or Reyna Foods taco stand, then you know that I HATE HATE HATE fake Mexican food. Despite their commercials on TV with the offensive fake Mexican accent, the food here is crap. So is the service. And the decor.  Here is the story of my latest trip.   We will start with the decor. It was bland and boring and just rang of some gringo's idea of what Mexico looks like based on a Speedy Gonzalez cartoon. Plus the tables are so small a party of four didn't have enough room for drinks and plates; we had to hijack a nearby empty table because the plates were so huge.   On to the service now. One big note to good service: don't be strung out when working. Our server looked like she was going to dope nod at any minute at the table. She took her merry time getting drinks (15 minutes for 2 drafts) she checked in in us maybe once. The only upside was that the food came out quickly.   The downside to food coming out quickly is that it was all reheated from a bag. I got the sampler platter figuring I could try a large variety of offerings. Big mistake. I should have gotten one crap meal instead about six. The chicken was dry and tough. The tamale corn was soggy and gritty. The tortillas were crap. The ground beef looked like Taco Bell beef. All of it was covered in a plasticky sauce that tasted like spicy nothing. The rice was hard. The refried beans were processes and pureed to the point where they resembled something to exit a dysentery riddled newborn.  If they charged Taco Bell prices I wouldn't be as upset but this wasn't cheap either.   To finish up Emiliano's is a stain on the name of Mexico. They know most Americans wouldn't know authentic Mexican cuisine if it walked up and punched them in the face. So they buy in a bunch of processed flavorless crap, microwave it, and send it out as \"authentic\". This place is crap. Steer clear.",

My meal was hot, excellent and came with nachos and salsa. The price is hard to beat ~$14.99 and the portion size is perfect. The shrimp were large (notch below jumbo compared to grocery store sizes) and well cooked without being overdone. Perfect plumpness. The one thing that could have been better is the spice level. There was none. A dash of hot sauce or more pepper would have been appreciated. I definitely will return and make this particular meal a go-to.",

When the bill came is when we found out how expensive it was. He nonchalantly said every other margarita is only five dollars, but the orange crusted one we ordered was 14. He really should have told us as he was trying to sell it. It was on the menu card, but Tucktaway at the bottom, and you really had to take it out of the holder to see it. I'm not sure where those more upset with how expensive it was, or the fact that the waiter was rude about the whole thing, where am I opinion it was his fault",

We started with the three dip trio with guacamole, cheese dip and pico de gallo - so yummy! Endless chips and salsa only adds to the great meal! Glass of wine and raspberry margarita.  We then ordered the fajitas (steak, shrimp, and chicken). They always come out steaming hot and are completely filled with meat and tons of veggies! This meal is pricey but so worth it. We have lots of leftovers to take home since it comes with 3 tortillas and a side salad with beans and rice!   Overall awesome restaurant. Their appetizers are all delicious and the fajitas are such a filling and tasty meal. Would definitely recommend to anyone and everyone! Our service was great and so was our waiter, it was a nice time and we will definitely be back plenty of more times!",

Whether you get your food to go or dine in, it always is really good. Their drinks are pretty decent and they really have a nice selection overall. The chips and salsa the servers greet you with are perfect to munch on while you sit and relax, ask for some cheese dip :) Usually the service is on point and we always enjoy our selves!   After my recent visit this past weekend, it seemed like they got super busy and the server got weeded pretty quickly. The manager did a really nice job of zooming around and helping her out.  When he realized we had been sitting there for over 20 minutes just waiting for her to come back, he was so sincere and apologized. I appreciate he took the time to realize what was wrong and and even took care of our dessert! CHURROS = amazing!!!",

I was very disappointed but me and my boyfriend was so hungry at this point we are willing to just share a plate and pay cash. We sat at the bar because the wait was fifteen minutes for a table. The bartender was very friendly and professional. Ooh their chips and salsa are so good! We had two bowls of them, they're very addictive! Afterwards we shared a entree which is a good size, we are surprisingly full. Since we saved some money by sharing entree, we ordered their dessert. We pick churros! Omg guys their churros are the best I've had in a restaurant. Just look at the picture man! Wow after the dinner I was so happy that I forgot about all my complaints when I first walked in. I will definitely come back again!",

Emiliano's is pretty spacious inside and the service was great! They told us a 30 minute wait, but we were seated within 10 minutes.   I started off with the Trio dip, which came with guacamole, white cheese sauce and pico de gallo. The chips were warm and crispy and the dips were fresh. For my main entree, I ordered the Chimichanga with beef, which came with a side of rice and lettuce/pico. I wasn't very impressed with the chimichanga or the side of rice. It was pretty much pieces of beef inside a burrito that was tossed into the deep fryer. The meat was really dry and kind of lacking in flavors and spices. The side of rice was too mushy.   Overall, I thought the food at Emiliano's was okay. I feel like I have had better Mexican food. Nothing I tasted here really captivated my taste buds. Prices are reasonable. I do have one major complaint though: SLIPPERY BATHROOM!",

The staff is extremely friendly, seriously! Our server was nice and the manager let us switch tables after we were seated in front of a long table of wasted men discussing/arguing about football. Its moderately priced and the theme inside is cute.   However, I feel like for a Mexican restaurant it's lacking flavor (bland, tasteless, unmemorable). I ordered the Cabo Chicken which is advertised as this chicken dish with a pineapple sauce (it sounded delish) The chicken was barely seasoned at all and had pineapple on top. There was a sauce on the veggies, but it was dark.. I'm not sure in a pineapple glaze/sauce is dark. The rice reminded me of Uncle Bens (I'm eating clean so I can spot pre-packaged food easily now.. It might have been packaged, it might not have been.. who knows) The refried beans were yummy!! Bobby ordered the faita plate. He said it was good, but again could have had better flavor for it being a Mexican restrauant. Honestly it tasted similar to something from Applebees. I'm just saying.  BUT the service is super friendly, the free chips and salsa rock & the drink menu + happy hour is great :) We will come back for drinks and maybe an appetizer.",

I ended up being pleasantly surprised.  There was no wait for a table for 2 at 6:00 on a Friday night.  Our waiter asked us for drinks, promptly brought them, and was great about refilling them throughout the meal.  The menu is pretty extensive, as is the drinks/dessert menu.  I was not feeling any of the vegetarian options (no cheese chiles rellenos :( ) so I did a Create Your Own Combo, as did my roommate.  I got 2 cheese enchiladas with rice and refritos ($8.49); he got a chicken burrito, a chicken enchilada, and a beef quesadilla with rice and refritos ($9.49).  We were both enjoying the free chips and salsa when the food arrived.  Almost too quickly - makes me wonder if it was pre-prepared and just microwaved.  At any rate, it was good.  There's not too much to say about cheese enchiladas, rice, and beans, but they were good.  My roommate enjoyed all his food as well.  We ordered a fried ice cream for dessert, which was very good.  Total before tip was about $28.  I really enjoyed this place - it wasn't crowded, service was really quick, and it seemed like a pretty good value.  I definitely wouldn't mind coming back.",

A step up in quality and taste, I have gotten take out from them several times, and have never been disappointed. The tamales in particular were moist and tasty - something that is easily and often overcooked. My chile rellenos were also very good. I recomment the Emiliano's Special which is huge with many different typical mexican dishes, and will satisfy just about anyones appetite.",

    "text": "I love Mexican food. I could live off of tacos, burritos, enchiladas, etc. From awful (not even close to real Mexican) Taco Bell bean burritos, to some of the most amazing food (Mexican or otherwise) that I had in a variety of restaurants in San Diego... GIVE ME TACOS NOW.  Yesterday in the full on miserable chaos of Pittsburgh's Southside St. Patrick's Day celebration, we decided to go for Mexican rather than bar food. I could not have been happier. This was, without a doubt in my mind, the highlight of a rainy obnoxious holiday that the majority uses as an excuse to be poorly mannered.   Walking into the establishment in an area of the Southside that I rarely venture to (Not a big fan of gentrification of most city's neighborhoods.) was a pleasant surprise. The hosting staff was friendly and attentive even on a very busy day like Saturday was. We were immediately seated and our drink orders were taken. Truth be told, I'm a beer girl at heart. I can no pass up a decent margarita on the rocks. While $9 was a little steep for me as far as drinks go (mainly because I rarely want to have just ONE margarita), the pomegranate margarita on the rocks was delicious. Served the first time with a slice of lime and the second time with a slice of orange, I preferred the pomegranate with orange slice combo best.  The menu is a little pricey but this isn't Taco Bell. They have a lot of authentic Mexican choices and I honestly had a difficult time choosing. The complimentary chips and salsa were delicious, fresh, and quickly refilled. In the end I kept it simple and went with the grilled carne asada tacos. The meat was delicious and the salsa and beans/rice/etc was really well cooked.  In all the service was great, the food was delicious if a bit pricey, and the drinks were spectacular. While not an \"all the time\" place for me, it's a great once in a while dinner.",

Chuck was heading towards the Beehive in south side so we gave him a lift and on the way stopped for a quick bite at Emiliano's. Needless to say, I was pretty surprised with everything.   Decently priced, and Delicious. I ordered the Enchiladas Poblanas, and the mole sauce was amazing. At only $9.99, it was definately on par with what I would expect to pay. My wife's fish tacos were also really good, and with the sides it came with was way too much food, always a good thing.   The only complaint was our waitress, she was not very involved with our table aside from the occasional refill. She kind of disappeared til it was time to pay. Other then that everything was great!",

The shrimp was EXCELLENT. It had tons of flavor.The rice was okay, it wasn't nasty and it wasn't the best. The guacamole was most likely fresh and pretty tasty. Their salsa was good and the chips were GREAT. I also ordered a side a beans ( which I think should MOST DEFINITELY come with the meal) and they were actually pretty decent, I liked them. I also asked if the restaurant had horchata (if you don't know what that is please get hip) and that horchata was comforting! In Los Angeles it's easy to walk into a Mexican restaurant in get horchata, but in Pittsburgh... Nahhhh. So I was super excited when the man made me some horchata (with no ice... God bless his soul). But this restaurant is definitely good, and it is a huge upgrade from Gran Agave at the Waterfront.",

This place is a bit run of the mill in decor. No one is going to write home about how cool it is. However, it is clean and comfortable and after two visits, I feel pretty confident in the quality of what I would call Tex-mex. There may be more \"authentic\" Mexican food on the menu, but I stuck with the burrito both times.  The service is good, frozen margaritas are tasty, food is yummy and tummy gets filled for a reasonable price.  I guess 5 stars would be the best, but I lived in Austin for 2 years, so my scale is skewed.",

After doing some Yelping, and finding that it was one of the only places open that fairly cheap, and had a diverse enough menu to cater to everyone, we decided to head to Emilianos Mexican Grill & Bar. After about a ten minute cab ride from downtown, we were ready to feast.  After arriving, we were seated promptly, and given our complimentary chips and salsa. As far as the menu goes, this place has all the standard offerings you would find at any similar Mexican restaurant, not that that is a bad thing necessarily. The food itself was pretty tasty, and I made sure to clean my plate. Is it something insanely awesome? Not really, but it does the trick.  Along with the good food and service, Emilianos was exceptionally clean, which is always a plus when dining out. If I lived in the area, I could see myself dining here a lot.",

On a Saturday night it was busy and they do not take reservations Friday or Saturday night.  We got there early and had time to grab a drink at the bar while we waited for our table. We were seated fairly quickly but I did not realize how small it is inside.  Our waitress was fantastic!  We ordered the dip trio to go with the free chips and salsa they bring out.  This contained guacamole which was not good, a white cheese dip that was fantastic and pico de gallo which was very tasty. I was so disappointed about the guacamole. I'm glad we didn't pay the extra money to have them make it fresh tableside. For my entree I ordered the chicken quesadilla which was not good at all.  I don't like when they use shredded chicken and it had no flavor.  Others in our party ordered the enchiladas and fajitas and were happy with them.",

    "text": "I have eaten here several times. I highly recommend looking for the \"Emiliano's Specialties\" which are marked on the menu and ordering one of those and skipping the standard Mexican Restaurant fare if you want something different or really authentic.   Things like the cheese enchiladas and chicken fajitas are pretty pedestrian. I mean, they taste the same here as they did at most other restaurants - if that is what you are hungry for, you will be pleased. I have gotten both of those items and been completely satisfied with their quality because I haven't expected them to be better than all the others I have had. When a restaurant has a large menu, you can pretty much assume the basics aren't going to have a lot of extras going into them, you know?  If you're looking for something more authentic, the chili rellenos that are marked with the \"house specialty\" icon are really good. Their corn flour has a unique, sweet flavor that balances well with the pepper and cheese. If you're looking for something more TexMex the chicken with bacon and Monterrey Jack cheese fajitas are really tasty. The bacon is just an unexpected salty/smokey flavor that pairs well with the creamy cheese and roasted peppers and onions.   I like their salsa, but if you don't like cilantro, you might not. I have gotten their chips warm and room temp, the warm ones were MUCH better. Also, I love that they refill the chips and salsa for free. If the first batch isn't warm, you have a second chance.   My main reason for not giving the place 4 stars is the service, which is more hit and miss. I have gotten excellent service here when it's been packed and marginal (possibly untrained, hard to tell) service here when it's pretty empty. Last time we were there, all the tables around us received much better service because they had a different server.",

    "text": "Emiliano's is a place I can see myself going a lot. I needed a relatively cheap, laid-back restaurant to take my date, and it fit the criteria perfectly.   The good:   Free chips and salsa, keeps your mind off waiting for your food, and the fresh chips and salsa were excellent.   Excellent service. My waiter was always bringing me more tea, without asking, and kept out chip basket filled. We also were just conversing about an unidentified yellow cube on my date's plate, and a passing waitress let us know that it was mango, asked us if we needed anything, and let us be again.  Portions were more than enough. I missed lunch, and between the chips and my entree I left stuffed, and I'm a bigger guy. Also, entrees are around $12-15, appetizers are about $4 for bean dip, cheese dip, or guacamole (which was very good) and $6-8 for other typical appetizers. The price was definitely fair, but I wouldn't say it was a steal either.  I had an excellent chicken and veggies over rice dish (something con pollo), and would recommend it. Very crisp vegetable tastes that still blended with the cheese sauce and sour cream. I loved every bite. My date got the appetizer quesadillas, and said they weren't anything special, and the bite I took of them confirmed this.   The bad:   The atmosphere is laid back, especially for the two seat tables. The booths looked cozy though. It's a nice place to take a girl if you're not looking for anything too serious, just a quick bite and a movie.  The menu seems kind of inaccessible, so if you're bringing a group or date that's not up to snuff on the cuisine terms, you'll have to do a bit of explaining.  The prices were right on, expect to get what to pay for, but not much more.  Overall a good place to grab a bite, and I'd recommend it to a friend, so it's gotten my nod of approval.",

I wouldn't call their food Mexican at all. It was very bland. I really don't care for spicy food whatsoever, but this place could use some. I ordered steak tacos with a side of beans and rice. The beans were runny, the rice was just boring. The steak tacos were literally steak in a taco. No cheese, lettuce, onion...nope. Just literally steak inside a taco shell. The steak itself was alright, but there was nothing Mexican about it. It was (again) bland and slightly dry.   Our server was very nice, so that's a plus.  But overall, this place bored the hell out of my taste buds.",

As soon as we sat down, on came the disappointments.  The waiter/bartender was lazy as heck.  The only time that he came to check on us was when we complained to the manager about the horrible food and service we were experiencing.  I ordered Tamales, Burrito and Chicken taco....It took forever for the food to arrive (over 30 minutes, which the manager/staff got an earfull about) and then when the food arrived, they forgot to bring the taco!  And then when they finally brought the taco, it was ice cold.  The entire experience was a complete let down.  When we went to complain and ask for the manager, it was as if the manager didn't even want to cop to being the manager...as if he was afraid of us.  Sheesh...Lots of great reviews I'm seeing on Yelp from this place so maybe the staff thought that my wife and I just deserved \"Special Treatment?\"  If you go to this place, just beware that maybe you'll be the next one to be singled out.  LOL...  Guess I'll jsut stick to Patron's",

I am a pretty hefty eater, but I know that when I go here I will leave with a full stomach, and sometimes even some leftovers.  The prices are pretty good. Upon glancing at the menu one might think that they're a little high, but for the amount of food you get, it's a good price.  The food is also pretty good. I've never really had anything I didn't like, and I've tried the tacos, flautas, burritos, arroz con pollo and more. Then again, I've never had anything that's completely wowed me either, which is why I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5.    Overall, Emiliano's is a nice restaurant with some buena comida.",

    "text": "This is my son's favorite Mexican restaurant so I decided to give it a try. I got there shortly after it opened and was able to order from the lunch menu. The decor is superb!  The staff was very attentive to my needs.  As is always the case you can get lunch entrees for way less than you would for dinner. This is the first time I saw an entree which I haven't seen in years. \"Arroz con pollo\" AKA chicken with rice. I have not seen this entree in some of the other Mexican restaurants I visited so I ordered that.  I was given complementary chips and salsa and had my food fairly quickly. The chips were very crunchy and I didn't want to eat to many of them so I could eat my lunch. When I got my meal I was amazed at the size!  For a lunch portion it was very generous! The chicken with mushrooms,onions, sour cream and everything else lay on top of a plate of rice. It was very filling to say the least. Since these are chicken strips cut  into the entree there were a couple of occasions where I found it just a little tough to chew but didn't feel the need to send it back. For the most part it was very good.  I was glancing at the folks at the next table who had ordered a dessert. They had ordered fried ice cream in a taco shell and I was literally blown away but the size of it. They told me it was indeed very good. It should be noted that they do offer vegetarian selections.  Since this week is Cinco de Mayo, Emiliano's is offering daily specials. Some of those specials are contingent on what location you are dining at. Today's is \"drop your business card\" and if you win they give you a meal for 25 people. Not my idea of a special but I came to try it out.  Note they have a birthday club you can sign up for so you get a free meal on your birthday. I did this and got a bounce back coupon for $5.00 off my meal which is good till June 1st.  Emiliano's has 3 locations with the other two being in Cranberry and Gibsonsia. Tres Rios down the street is an offshoot of this restaurant. They have a full bar and is more family oriented. Off street parking is available and I am grateful to be able to try a Mexican dish I hadn't seen for years.  If you are a fan of this restaurant I just learned they are building a 4th location in McCandless Crossing.",

The bathroom lights aren't too bright to make your overwhelming headache hurt even more, and there's enough space in the stall to allow a decent enough splash-zone. Plenty of towels available to freshen up after the ordeal, too. 10/10 would recommend throwing up here.   As for the food, I've only ever had the chips and salsa (which are pretty good!) and the guac. The guac is made in front of you, which is super cool to watch and reassuring to see that the guac is made from fresh ingredients. It's nothing special, but watching it be made to eat makes it a fun time.   My friend enjoyed his margarita, and they have good prices for fairly decent Mexican food in the city. Service is good and fast.",

It was actually a bit smaller on the inside than it seems from the outside. The booths, however, are huge. You can easily fit six people in each booth.  I ordered the Veggie Fajitas. It came as a steaming pot of vegetables with rice, beans and salad on the side. It was a make your own. It had a TON of peppers. I do agree that it all was a bit tasteless, but that is easily fixable with your preferred salsa or hot sauce and some salt. It didn't explode in my mouth, but it wasn't disappointing either. I think that some people who do not enjoy the normal natural spicy tendency of mexican food would rejoice to have the option of opting out. I would come again and try some brunch.",

The beef inside was chopped up in little squares, which I've never seen before. The ranchero sauce tasted more like chipotle tobasco, and after one bite I decided that I couldn't take another. I told our waiter, and he took the plate away and brought me a bowl of bean soup. I thought to myself, how can you mess bean soup up!? And Emiliano's answered my question promptly. The soup was legitimately just half a can of black beans poured into a bowl with some cheese sprinkled on top. I was so shocked. This I ate without complaining merely because I didn't want to hold up the others who were eating with me. Maybe because I'm from Texas I have higher standards for tex-mex/Mexican food, but this was worse than Taco Bell.",

    "text": "If you know me, you know I love Pittsburgh's Emiliano's Mexican restaurant. This obsession dates back half a decade when I discovered the Southside location via my college friends. If someone had a birthday we probably we're getting out of the dirty South Oakland (Pitt's off-campus housing area) and venturing to the Southside for divine margaritas and delicious food.  Post-college I moved about 2 blocks away from the Southside location. I used to joke that the SouthSide Works was the \"most dangerous part of town\" for me to live; since I was within 2 blocks of Emiliano's, as in close enough to be dangerous to my waistline and bank account.  My whole love affair with a Mexican restaurant is actually unexpected because I don't love tequila, nor do I eat beans, peppers, or anything at all remotely spicy. What I do love are chips. cheese, chorizo, and avocado, which Emiliano's dishes are filled with.  I have two favorite dishes at Emiliano's, the grilled shrimp quesadilla and the Choripollo. Emilian's grilled shrimp quesadilla is unlike any I've had elsewhere. The shrimp are sweet, tasty & meaty for a $12.99 appetizer, but the best part to me is the cheese. I'm unsure what type of cheese Emiliano's uses (it's yellow) but it is delicious and sweet as well. This dish is perfect for me since it's not an overwhelming amount of food. I can indulge in my margaritas chips & salsa too without feeling too guilty.  My other favorite dish is the Choripollo, a marinated chicken breast topped with chorizo sausage and a delicious white cheese sauce. For 14.99 this dish is amazing. It's a huge chicken breasts doused in the cheese & sausage mixture, served with rice, tortillas, guacamole salad and more taco cheese. I always have plenty of leftovers with this order.  Their margaritas on the rocks with a salt rim are my all time favorite drink, besides Moscato. I crave them, ask my BF. These margaritas are smooth and refreshing not sickly sweet like many bar versions can be. It is a good deal to get the pitcher of margarita on the rocks, if you are with at least one other person and you each plan on having more than 1 margarita. Think of it as an investment.   My boyfriend explores the menu more than I do. His recent favorite dish is the Chipotle Pork Wings, three  slow-smoked pork ribs basted in a sweet and spicy chipotle-bbq sauce, served over a bed of rice and black beans. For 14.99 this is another amazing quality meal full of flavor.  I truly love this place, it might be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. Anytime we are going to splurge and go out I always petition for Emiliano's. Since we now live in the North Hills of Pittsburgh we will even visit the Cranberry Emiliano's location.  Which makes me even more excited that Emiliano's has announced they're opening a location in McCandless Crossing! Now Emiliano's will be all but 10 minuets away from me. I better start saving my meals out budget to prepare! I've already told everyone I know how excited I am haha   I wrote more about my Emiliano's Mexican, A Love Affair  & posted pictures of my fave margaritas on my blog at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmoscatoismymantra.com%2Femlianos-love-affair%2F&s=43661299c046b16f99775fdba1582a949a47cf8ece35b0da8f14b88b0d0f97bb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">moscatoismymantra.com/em...</a>",

Their chips and salsa are solid as well.  I always do the combo, 2 burritos, 1  with pulled chicken, 1 with steak tips.  Both of these meats are great, tender and juicy.  Burrito sauce is good as well.  My SO got the pork wings, which were AWESOME!! Perfect hint of chocolate in the sauce!  Portions are large, we had a ton to takeaway.  Emiliano's is consistently good for Tex-mex/American Mexican food.",

It took a long time for our waiter to return to our table to take our order and processing our checks and credit cards. We got our food quickly enough and they gave us chips and salsa as appetizers on time, but we had to wait on our waiter for a very long time.   Also, our waiter's shift ended in the middle of processing our checks and we had to flag down someone else to get our checks.

As expected, the chips and salsa are good, and the cheese dip is on-par with most \"authentic\" Mexican eateries popping up these days, so it's easy to get settled into your meal.   The entrees aren't going to blow you away, but if you're on a Mexican food kick, the food will definitely satiate your craving. I've tried a few of their burritos, the enchiladas rancheras, and the fajitas - all of which are pretty good. Again, not the best I've ever had, but still very good.  Service has always been hit-or-miss for us. We've ordered drinks and never had them arrive, and we've also waited for what seemed like an eternity for our check other times. Of course, we've also had really good service a few times, so if you're in a hurry, I would recommend telling your server when you sit down and hope for the best. As with most Mexican restaurants, your food will come out quickly, but you might find yourself waiting for refills and your check.  Regardless, I really enjoy Emiliano's. The food is good, the atmosphere is relaxed, and employees are very friendly. Plus, I've never had to wait for a table.",

They are spicy and simple (two corn taco shells - authentic and soft - for each of the three tacos you get filled simply with their spicy and yummy chorizo).  They give you two sauces and a fresh lime to jazz them up.  Friends got the fajitas and seemed to really like them and I would also recommend the Queso Fundito and Chicken Nachos for group munching.  If you leave here hungry and completely sober, you have not done your job properly.  PS - Nothing screams authenticity like misspellings on an \"ethnic\" menu.  CHARMING.  PPS - When I found out this was a chain - local, but still a chain - I cried a little inside.  I stick to the Southside location and try to forget there's one on McNightmare.  Makes me feel better.",

Upon bringing the salsa and chips to our table, the waiter proceeded to dump the dish of salsa all over me, and my down jacket (it got on my suede shoes, jeans and other members of my party as well). The server was very apologetic, and I like to think that my party was understanding. After all, accidents happen to all of us.   The waiter helped to mop the floor, and wipe down my jacket (albeit with a questionably sanitary dish rag) and apologized profusely. We asked to see the manager and explained the scenario to him. I asked that they comp the dry cleaning on my jacket, and he begrudgingly agreed.   Our food came promptly, and was delivered by the manager. Upon handing my sister her plate, he said (under his breath): \"Don't touch the plate, it's hot. I wouldn't want to have to pay for your hospital bill too.\"  We found this a little off-putting, but tucked into our meals anyway.   The food was mediocre at best, and both me and my sister found the retried beans to be inedible. They tasted as if they had been burnt, or had liquid smoke added to them. The flavor was overpowering, and even a healthy dose of Cholula couldn't help. As we were leaving, another waiter made a snide comment about my request to comp my dry cleaning.   Overall, our experience at Emiliano's was disappointing. The food was just mediocre, and wasn't nearly enough to make up for the treatment of the managers and waitstaff. (For clarity's sake: our personal waiter was very apologetic and understanding of the situation). I will never return.",

    "text": "Mom's birthday was belatedly observed this evening, and since she's a lifelong Mexicophile (even though she's not at all Mexican), it was takeout for her from her choice, Emiliano's.   Mom, Dad, and Sis all ordered Emiliano's Special, a platter with one of each of the following: burrito, tostada, enchilada, chile relleno, taco, plus one serving of rice and beans.   Dad and Sis didn't comment, but Mom claims her food was blandsville aside from the chile relleno, which I also found to be a pretty potent, parched, ground beef-packed, poblano upon partaking of it.   The tamale I got to taste was fairly harmless, starchy, and had some dry chicken inside.   Being born in February will always make one the square peg in the family, particularly when your father, mother, and sister have natal days in July, August, and September respectively.   I, The Aquarian ordered the Burrito Cancun, a jumble of scallops (you can also choose shrimp), beans, sauteed onions, tomatoes, and bell peppers bound up in a flour tortilla. The only thing I didn't like about it was that it didn't have a twin; I wanted more! The scallops were meaty, plentiful, spicy, and luscious. The tortilla was a blanket used to swaddle infant angels. The veggies complimented everything, and I didn't mind the beans, even though I'm not a fan of them. The burrito came with sour cream and an adequate example of guacamole.   The Queso Con Carne was also a winner, its milky consistency and delicate flavor serving as a fine coating for what were the apex of fried corn tortilla chips. They were so ideally esculent, not to mention a radiant shade of yellow, I ate half of them plain, until I came across that fruity, minty, dandy picosa salsa of theirs. We've still got a bagful of chips and two styrofoam cups of that salsa left, and my midnight snack is past due...  Spicy food is something I do  like, but for me, it's certainly not a necessity, even for Mexican food, so perhaps that colors my rating a bit. My favorite Mexican foods are rich and filling; my burrito was just that and more.   I liked most of what I had from the obviously polemical Emiliano's. Un cuatro es lo que obtiene.  *shrugs shoulders*",

Emiliano's, even though I love your Sangria Margarita (and truthfully that is the only think I love at your place), it is not worth more than the 1 star I am posting.  Why, you may ask?  Well here it goes-  so it was a busier Friday night and I had a friend in from out of town and since I live right there, we wanted something quick and within walking distance, so we figured, hey, the food is mediocre, but it is super close, so lets just do this.  There were a few open seats at the bar, so we take them as we enjoy eating at the bar and were not up for waiting.  The bartender who is not as busy as you would think since the restaurant was quite packed, made eye contact and even cleaned up right near us but seemed to not want to wait on us.  After that, and then the fact that she waited on a guy who came up after us and then another group of girls, I had to say something to someone as she was clearly not waiting on for whatever reason (we are nice people and good tippers so I do not know WTF her problem was).  Since she behaved as she did, I went to the host and asked him if there was someone who could wait on us at the bar because she was not doing so but waiting on everyone who came after us.  He got one of the serves to handle us who was FABULOUS... BUT he did not even apologize about his B*tchy bartender who was making our evening quite obnoxious when all we wanted was a quick bite to eat.    The food is bland, the service can suck (if you get this nasty bartender that I am referring to), and it leaves me unimpressed.  I will never go back because of the service mishap and the fact that not one person apologized for her behavior and the lack of service that we had received.  If Chi Chi's still existed, I would go there before Emiliano's.",

Personally, I think my fajitas were the best choice of the night, but that's just me.  A little on the oily side, but generally hot, fresh and plentiful with a full complement of mexican rice and guacamole salad.  3 stars, since I think \"decent\" isn't an ideal way to feel about food and the price is higher than Mad Mex for lesser quality.  But hey, Emiliano's truly is A-OK and I'll probably go back again.  Ole!",

I had the fish bowl margarita and added a Corona to it and it was really good. The food came out quickly. We ordered carne asada and flautas and everything was delicious. I want to try going there again before I give this place another star because so far this is the best Mexican restaurant I've been to in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I had a pretty nice time here. I live only a few blocks away, but never visited until I had a coupon for a free appetizer.  My roommate and I came later in the evening, and there was no wait to be seated. The margaritas were on special for happy hour, and even though it was only lime & rocks for the special, I got one and was pleasantly surprised. I'm not usually a fan of lime margaritas OR margaritas on the rocks, but this one was tasty, for only $3.00.  The chips and salsa were really good--the salsa was thick but not chunky--the kind I love, and the chips were crisp but not oily how they can sometimes be at restaurants.  For our free appetizer we got queso con carne. I just thought it was so-so. It tasted too much like ground beef--I guess I was expecting something that tasted more like cheesy chili. Oh well, it was free.  I got the chimichangas for my entree, and I thought they were good, nothing special, but good. I really liked the rice and beans on the side though.  Since I only live a few blocks away, I'll probably be back.",

I typically get the queso and either a quesadilla, fajitas, or buffalo chicken tacos.   The service is dependent on where you sit. The service tends to be less good if you're seated in a booth by the bar since the bartenders can get a little busy and can't see your table from the over the bar. Overall would recommend this as a cheap and tasty happy hour!",

I loved the corn tortillas with cilantro, onion, and sauces given. There were three tacos, so I was stuffed by the end. The tacos also came with a side of rice and beans. My friend who had the quesadilla said it was delicious and huge. Their mojitos were also excellent, light and refreshing. Overall, a great place to grab Mexican in the southside.",

As soon as we sat down, they delivered homemade nachos and perfect salsa- fresh & spicy!! Our server, Edgar, recommended the enchilada suiza which was amazing and cheesy and oh, so, good! Truly authentic and great-tasting food. And a very enjoyable experience. We will be back soon!!",

Nothing really stands out about this restaurant, except the pollo con arroz (spelling?) which is a chicken, rice, and veggie dish with a cheese and sour cream sauce. Not light on calories, but it has a really good flavor and I haven't seen a similar dish at any other Mexican restaurants. Service is just ok, during busy weekend times it's difficult to get drink refills or even just the bill. Typically has a shorter wait time than the other popular restaurants in southside (cheesecake factory hofbrahaus, etc.) So it's a good place to eat before catching a movie.",

Salsa has no color from jalapenos, cilantro or anything. Tasteless  The chicken in enchiladas is not flavored with cooked onion or tomatoes, it is just tasteless blobs of chicken. They can do much better!  You won't hear Mexican music here. Just Loud sports which ruins the food and dining for me  Frozen margaritas are ok, but their mix needs some changes.

I was also very happy with the extra spicy salsa that was given to me after I requested something hotter than the normal salsa that they give to all tables. Good salsa provides the basis for all good Mexican food in my book. Most of the other food was average American / Mexican, but with half price draft beers, appetizers, and margaritas during happy hour who can complain? Their desserts were also pretty good. I guess I would say it's better than Mad Max but not as good as Los  Cabos or Verde .",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I am a huge fan of Mexican food.  I was disappointed when I moved to Pittsburgh 5 years ago at the lack of options in the city.  Luckily that has improved over the years.  Emilianos is a place I knew existed, but for some reason I never actually made the trip to the South Side to try it out until last night.  Many of the other reviews on this site are spot on.  The one critique I saw in other reviews that I didn't experience was poor service.  We were visiting on a cold Wednesday night, so perhaps the fact that it was a slower time affected this.  Regardless, our service was excellent, if not overbearing at times.  I think our server visited our table at least 5 times during the course of our meal.  Perhaps they have read their reviews and focused on this.  The meal started promising enough.  I was happy to see free unlimited chips and salsa.  That is becoming rare these days.  In addition, the margaritas were quite good as well.  My girlfriend had the Sangria Margarita, and it bordered on too sour at times, but it was acceptable.  The food was just 'ok'.  That's the best way to put it.  I had the steak fajitas and my girlfriend had the steak fajita quesadilla.  My fajitas were fine.  Nothing spectacular, but perfectly acceptable for a fajita.  The quesadilla was another story.  First of all, it wasn't even cut, which was bizarre.  It arrived at the table as a complete folded over tortilla.  Second, one of the main components of a quesadilla is cheese, and the cheese that was in her dish was odd to say the least.  I would put it somewhere between a queso sauce and the pump cheese you get on your nachos at a ballpark.  I would have expected a melted shredded cheese of some sort.  I didn't hate my meal, but for the price (45 dollars for 2 entrees and 2 margaritas), I would probably take my service elsewhere the next time I get a craving for Mexican cuisine.",

The guacamole was good, but a small portion (especially for the price). The tacos were good too, but a bit smelly. My biggest critique was that they were over-priced; if I'm paying $12 for three tacos, then they better be some incredible tacos.  On a positive note, Emiliano's had a nice atmosphere. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves with their giant margaritas. Overall, it's a nice restaurant but simply over-priced.",

The food was pretty good, but it wasn't anything amazing. A few things that brought my review down from 4 stars to 3 stars are the lack of service and the dirty restrooms.   We asked for ketchup and the server never came back to us. We asked the bar tender for ketchup and he finally got back to us. It was also difficult to get water refills. I wanted more salsa, but didn't want to bother with flagging down a server so I just finished my meal without it.   I don't know if I would go back with the current service situation. I feel like they need to hire additional servers. I have to give them credit for having a giant sign outside saying 'We're hiring'.  NOTE: The refried beans are vegetarian.",

I showed up at Happy Hour during the week and the place was dead.  I sat at the bar and ordered the house marg with no salt and it was served as requested and tasted fine.  Later on I ordered a second one and it was served with salt.  As the place was still dead I was mildly annoyed.  The chips were warm and fresh and the salsa was bland.  Ordered Chori-Pollo and quick as a flash my entree arrived but it was the wrong dish.  Lots of apologies and smiles and a second quick flash later the correct dish arrived.  It was mostly hot and tasty but the re-fried beans served as a side were cold.  When I asked for my check the friendly bartender promptly gave me another patron's check.  Once again, lots of apologies and smiles and the correct check was presented.  Overall there were too many bumps in the road and the meal was just average.  There are about a thousand places to eat and drink on Carson Street.  These folks gave me no reason to return.",

That being said I enjoyed my Fajita Texana. That was loaded with onions and meat. My mojito was also good. The price is fair and the food is good. The best thing about the place is that they have outdoor seating and the sun shines on that side of the street until sunset, so on a nice day it's worth just going to sit outside with chips and a beer. Worth a try if your hungry and walking around south side and not in the mood for bar food.",

We remind our waitress of  this when our food arrives ahead of our appetizer and I gotta say she was  dismissive about it,  \"Oh I forgot.\"  Forgetting what we ordered really isn't okay and you need to try and make amends not just ask if we still want it.  The food we did get was only alright. I got one of the Pittsburgh themed burritos and wife got a California burrito.  Both were just okay.  The place is clean but the bathroom door handle for example  was broken and a staffer was in there talking on their cell phone.   All in all I sad to see this place start to slide.",

Though their food is a little bland, maybe pre-made in some cases, it's a nice treat if you're looking to satisfy your hankering for fresh made tortilla chips or a tangy margarita.  I've been here a few times thus far.  Recently I ordered a taco salad, since the weather was H-O-T and I couldn't consume anything heavy.  It wasn't the typical taco salad with the sour cream, salsa, and plop of meat.  My grilled chicken was flavorful and it was topped with delicious veggies that my stomach greatly appreciated.  I was unsure about the salad dressing, cilantro lime, but the waiter urged me to try it.  Kudos to him for that recommendation!  Sweet, tart, and LIGHT!  All of that with a crisp and tasty shell, I left one happy girl.   OH!  I forgot to mention my Sangria Margarita - or as I call it - the Sangarita.  What a perfect combination.  Sweet, tart, tangy, with a kick of tequila - a cool summer cocktail which I will enjoy all summer long.  I rate this a 3.5 - if the food was a bit more flavorful, it would be a solid 4.",

To which I say a big Thank you!  Services was fantasic.  I know dealing with a large table is not easy especially when 3 are kids.   The staff was so accommodating, professional and all around great.  Our food came out in timely manner, and there was not a single complaint.  Everyone enjoyed their food.    Everyone at table said they will return.  Thank you to the staff for a great lunch and experience.",

    "text": "I ordered sopapilla for carry out a few weeks ago. It somehow took 20 minutes for Emiliano's to make this single dish. Having paid a little over 6 dollars for a dessert you'd expect something of decent size, however we were given 7 sopapilla that appeared to be tortilla chips rather than the fried dough you might expect. That along with a small side of whipped cream left me less than satisfied. After driving home and then noticing this, I actually decided that it was worth driving back because the dessert was so poor. My money was refunded, but it still wasted an hour of my time. I'd at least avoid ordering any desserts from this restaurant, and check your carry outs before you leave!",

    "text": "My wife and I went to try this place out because of the word of mouth. Well, wishing we didn't waste our time.  The owner or manager was very nice and sat us as soon as we walked in. After a few short minutes our waitress came over and took our drink orders. Was pretty shocked she didn't card us at all! That is a huge violation and I know from being in the food industry before that you need to card everyone!  After we got our drinks we sat there for nearly 25 minutes and order was never taken. I went to tell the manager/order because we just wanted to pay for our drinks and leave. We were told it was okay, didn't have to pay.   If it was possible to give a zero I would. Service like this is really uncalled for. I will never give this place another shot again. We wasted our time for nothing. Everyone should know how bad this service is.",

    "text": "Mexican food may be my favorite.  There are a lot of options around the area, but I always seem to gravitate toward Emiliano's....because they are awesome!  The atmosphere is very fun, without being over the top.  I can hold a conversation with my fellow diners without having to lose my voice.  And the food is amazing too!  Every meal starts with chips and salsa.  I usually judge a Mexican restaurant on their salsa, and Emiliano's definitely hits the nail on the head.  Not to mention, the chips are warm when they bring them to your table.  Warm chips and salsa?  Sign me up!  I always get a margarita, on the rocks, no salt, with a coronita in it.  They are not too sweet, which is something that I often notice about restaurant margaritas (so much SUGAR).  When it comes times to order food, most recently I got Flautas.  There was MORE than enough food to feed my belly, and I had leftovers for the next day.  Emiliano's also makes a killer guacamole... Seriously, try it!",

    "text": "I'm not a snob; I just know what I like. I've had Mexican food all over the world. Everyone does it their own way. So while we can diss -- rightfully so -- Chipolte for just stuffing ground beef in a tortilla and calling in \"Mexican,\" people who are actually taking care make Mexican with endless variations. I love Emiliano's. It's fresh. It's tasty. It's consistent -- no bad meals, not even once. And good beer and drink specials. And awesome, friendly service, always. Pittsburgh doesn't have a ton of good Mexican. I ate at Steel Cactus on Carson today and it sucked. Awful. The BYOB Mexican joint nearby is good but it doesn't compare to Emiliano's, which is also extraordinarily clean. A+ in my book. Because I like it. Bet you will too. If you're not some foodie snob.",
