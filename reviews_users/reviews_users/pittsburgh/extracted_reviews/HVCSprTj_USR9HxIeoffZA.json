While I haven't brought it home yet, I enjoy it every day at work.  Each blend or single-region/origin they produce has its own character.  I particularly like the Mexican Chiapas and Three Rivers Roast.  They also do tasting flights of specialty coffees.  I'm sure this sort of thing is on the rise, but they're the only place I know that does it. This flight confirms Zeke's standing as True coffee sommelier's.  $10 buys you four 6-ounce pours of particular low-yield and boutique coffee varietals that you've probably never had before, and that really allow you to get the terroir of a region, as well as back-story including, who, where, and how the coffee was grown.   Their website is mediocre, and the pastries are acceptable if you need a bite, but not special. Really, Zeke's is about the coffee and they utterly nail it.",

It's more of a...coffee-ish milk shake. For me, coffee is just a medium for sweet, delicious flavors, BUT the BF is a True-blue coffee lover, so I am a bit more knowledgeable about coffee than I normally would be.  And the coffee at Zeke's is decent coffee; not as good as CTR but MUCH better than Starbucks. We've never really had the pastries/goodies/sandwiches, so we are really no help there, but the atmosphere is pretty cool too. Kind of a Hipster-Eclectic mix. All in all, he likes Zeke's but there a two cons; 1) you can only buy the beans by the pound, which doesn't blow me out personally, and 2) they are completely inconsistent with their pricing. We can go there twice on Saturday and once on Sunday, get a refill into his own cup- the same one he uses everywhere- and get charged three different prices. This realllly rubs us the wrong way. So...I would try it, but just advise watching what you're being charged.",

It is small batched roasted, I'm pretty sure right now he can only do 1 or 2 pounds at a time! I don't have the most discerning coffee palate, but this stuff is good... nothing like what your friend roasts in their air popper.  They have brewed coffee (I can't remember for the life of me if he does espresso) in addition to 6-8 by-the-pound offerings that were extremely freshly roasted... my pound was still warm! Averages around $13/lb.  The storefront is pretty no-nonsense bare bones, don't worry about tromping a little snow inside or bringing in your bike with you to grab your coffee.  The proprietor (I forget his name) is extremely friendly and welcomes a chat. He'll also do custom roasts for you, no minimum I'm pretty sure, especially handy if you want a half decaf blend or the like. I recommend calling ahead if you have a large order, as well.  Hours are hard to find online, but I posted a photo of what was on the door as of today.",

    "text": "I'm constantly on the lookout for a good cup of coffee.  I was meeting someone and suggested Zeke's since the location was convenient for both of us.    Since it was warm/non-raining outside, there were about 3 tables with chairs outside.  However, they were commandeered by non-customers.  I've noticed that the Bloomfield Crazy Mocha has the same problem and it's too bad, because it would have been nice to sit outside, but no big deal.  Inside, there was one small table, a long counter w/ stools along one side of the storefront, and a second counter across.  Zeke's roasts their own coffee but - oopsie - someone left the beans in the roaster a tad too long because it smelled like burnt coffee inside.  They also grind their own coffee, so between the music and the grinders, it could get a little loud for conversation.  I arrived about 3 p.m. and they had a lone muffin in terms of something to eat.  But I'm imagining they focus more on coffee and limit their food options to muffin/cookies.  Service was friendly.  I got a large cup of coffee with a splash of half and half for two bucks.  The coffee was incredibly good:  very full bodied but not bitter.  The person that was sitting at the table left shortly after I got there so we were able to sit at a table rather than stools/counter which a shortie like me can find uncomfortable.  My friend had an iced tea which she said was good.  I'm sure they also make things like espresso, lattes, and cappuchinos, but am not sure they would make things with lots of syrup, whipped cream, etc.  Seemed like kind of a nuts and bolts kind of place, and I mean this in a positive way.  The coffee gets five stars, the atmosphere 3.5 stars.  Note to Zeke's:  if you want to offer your customers outdoor seating, try to find a way to shoo away locals who sit there and don't order anything.",

Even though if was hot outside on the day that we visited I decided to get a large americano while my wife went with an iced coffee.  As we ordered both my wife and I looked over the myriad homemade baked goods.  The gentlemen making our coffees was rather pleasant and within a few minutes he had ours ready.  Both of our coffees were really good as they were strong and smooth and my wife commented to me a couple of times about how much she liked hers.

Even though it was just a standard drip coffee made in bulk that had been sitting there awhile, it tasted like the quality of a pour over or French press but for only $2!  I need to go back and find out what beans they used in it.  Definitely the best standard drip coffee I've had in Pittsburgh.  So I'm upgrading this to 5 stars.  Also they do have Wifi--another review said they didn't so maybe that was added more recently.  **I went back later and realized they actually have several varieties of drip out though they just asked me if I wanted \"light\" or \"dark when in reality there were about 5 different kinds.  They let me sample them all so I could find the one I liked last time and buy the beans for that, which was super awesome.  I would encourage them to list the coffees they have each day on a board so people know what the specific options are and the varieties they are drinking. I would also suggest they add a roasting date to their coffee beans since they are roasted locally and are clearly pretty fresh.",

While the coffee is very good and often has a pretty foam heart, the service and atmosphere is where it's at. This shop is cozy and comfortable, you feel at home here. That's how a coffee shop should feel in my opinion.   Not only that, I'm infinitely amused by the massive collection of local advertisements and odds and ends. I like to come here to collect info on what's going on 'round'tahn. This is pretty common in Pittsburgh though, and always appreciated. Starbucks is very sterile in that respect.

The only drawback here is the neighborhood - if you're not an \"East Liberty Type\" (as I'm not), you may be put off by all the traffic and entitled Google employees.  If you're not, more power to ya.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh has some good coffee places and some good bakeries, but it doesn't have many places that successfully combine the two into an all-around great cafe. This is one of the things I've missed most about Boston (the land of Flour, Tatte, Crema, Thinking Cup, and more).  Zeke's is the closest I've found to that here, and it does a solid job of filling the void. They have a small but tasty selection of baked goods with interesting flavors, and the offerings change every time you go. They also make fun seasonal drink menus, and I'm a fan of the fact that they offer tea lattes beyond the basic chai latte.  If I have any complaint, it's that they don't post what baked goods they currently have anywhere, so I never know whether they're currently offering anything appealing enough to inspire me to trek all the way here.",

The cheddar/bacon and cheddar/chive biscuits are the best I've ever had. Last week I had a mushroom, bacon, cheese pastry that was so good!  Also, they have been my go-to shop for beans for a over a year now. The beans aren't burnt. Perfectly roasted for a tasty brew at home.  Beware that parking can be a hassle.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I have been on the hunt.. for the best cold brew in Pittsburgh.. and we found it here at Zeke's.  I can't believe I only gave Zeke's 4 stars in my last review. They are incredibly deserving of the full 5 stars- they have the total package.   First of all, thank you Zeke's for being located in East Liberty. I think it's wonderful when businesses choose to put their business in a neighborhood that could really benefit from having it there. Everyone wants to have a store in Lawrenceville, South side, Shadyside, etc... but it takes a really awesome business to go into a neighborhood that isn't the most sought out, in order to bring more people to it. I appreciate that. They serve TONS of local treats, from the Gluten Free Goat Bakery, as well as plenty of others. It's awesome that Zeke's has options for vegans and non-vegans alike. They have an awesome outdoor seating area, and the inside is adorable as well. Their coffee is just simply the best. We have taken home their whole bean coffee and made cold brew with it at home, and have been there as often as possible to purchase their delicious cold brew. Their cold brew is strong, dark, and worth every penny. Cold brew can be a hit or miss I have discovered- some places literally give you 50% water, 20% ice and 20% cold brew & 10% empty space. Not at Zeke's. I have even ordered the cold brew without ice before, so we could take it to work the next day, and they don't even mind- which a lot of other coffee shops will not do. I cannot say enough about this place. The service is ALWAYS spectacular, their coffee is great, they are an awesome shop and I am proud to support them. After trying the cold brew in so many other coffee shops lately and realizing that Zeke's is the best, I felt the need to call the manager myself this morning to tell them how wonderful their cold brew is. I'm glad I did, but she informed me that they are going to start selling it in more places around the Burgh! They currently even have it available at the farmer's market downtown, which I did not know!  If you are a coffee lover, you will love Zeke's. It's just the best in the Burgh.",

The tables along the wall have outlets with USB ports. I have yet to try a baked good (though I hear good things!), but the coffee is good. What's nice too is that this shop is on a major bus route so multiple buses are passing by at all times (71C, 82, 71B, etc), and the East Busway is a short walk away. Outdoor seating is available in the warmer months! Please give this place a try; I'm certain you won't be disappointed!",

Glad to report that Zeke's does! They carry loose leaf teas in a variety of options (I stick to english breakfast or earl gray).   They also have almond milk, which is a fab option to have. And even better, they bake in-house goods and even have small savory bites available. Their pasty selection looks beautiful and I need to dive into that one of these days. They also sell a few local favorites, like Gluten Free Goat (gluten free baked goods, dah!).   I also like that they have a decent amount of seating inside and a great patio in the front to sit and enjoy your coffee. I'd argue that perhaps the slatted tables inside aren't the most conducive to a cup of liquid, but that's a minor observation. The other cool thing is they have food trucks that visit during lunchtime hours. You can usually find their schedule of food trucks on the website or twitter. I've seen Berlin Street Foods out, which I can vouch for being a delicious choice!   Hop around the corner from Target and grab a to-go cup from their drive-thru too! You don't even have to get out of your car for a good cup of coffee (or tea in my instance!).",

I had very high hopes for visiting before coming here for the very first time, and to be honest I'm a little disappointed by my experience. Yes, the coffee is good. Yes, the baristas are nice. Yes, the people seem hip and gentrified. Okay, these are all nice things but I don't quite understand how these three factors (which many other cafes in the area also possess) led to Zeke's high appraisal.  Things I didn't like about Zeke's: there is no aircon and it's HOT. I don't think this is a great place to get work done, unlike what other reviewers had said. I tried working outside on the benches for a while (it's not so stuffy outside) but because there are no power outlets on the exterior of the store I had to move back inside. It's a little dim, and the tables are a little rickety (makes it hard to type / write). They don't have glasses for water (they use paper cups) and they put my coffee in a paper cup as well, which makes my eco-mind a little sad.  So yeah. It's a decent place. I wouldn't rave about it, though. Maybe if I try the baked goods next time I may change my mind.",

Most of all, I was in love with my latte. I didn't get the young lady's name who was manning the bar, but she was fabulous! She was also part dj and her music selections were on point. I sat down and was able to decompress.  There is street parking available on both sides of the street. There isn't a parking lot specific to the coffee shop, but we were able to find a spot with ease. My latte was strong and smooth, which I definitely appreciated. The hardest part was deciding what kind of treat to try. I kept eyeing a giant chocolate covered pretzel. They have chocolate from a local place and some other amazing deliciousness displayed right in front of your face. I really want that pretzel still, which of course means I'll be back!",

    "text": "I love Zeke's so hard. Their blends are just so delicious (my Top 3: 1.) Allegheny Reserve 2.) Steel City Blend 3.) Hippie Blend).  But I'll review the space since you can get Zeke's at theIr drive-thru by the Target, the Bloomfield Farmers' Market, 52nd St Market in Lawrenceville, Whole Foods, Giant Eagle...the list goes on.  The spot is a really great place to hang out in though. They have electric outlets by the tables for people who want to work on their mobile devices, or a nice cozy couch area. Wifi is free and public - no password needed!  There is also a nice selection of sweet pastries and menu items made to order. On some days they carry items from other local spots like Gluten Free Goat, Relish, Pigeon Bagel, and always some of their own. They have a nice variety for all dietary restrictions too - vegan, gluten free, flourless, etc.   Just love everything about Zeke's and I love being able to support all things local when enjoying a great cup of coffee. #fueledbyzekes",

There is an ample amount of coffee and tea to pick from, and the baristas are willing to make you any drink you may be feeling. The atmosphere is also quite pleasant and it provides a great workspace. The vegan carrot cake is delicious and moist, and the vegan lemon raspberry scone is quite good as well. Overall just a wonderful spot with good drinks and pastries!",

For $3.50, the latte itself was both beautiful and delicious, with just the right level of sweetness. When I went around noon, there was a steady but not overwhelming buzz of people around me, and everyone else seemed to be getting equally wonderful service and tasty drinks.   One of the things I really like about this place is the variety of seating options, both inside and outside. The outside is a little offset from the sidewalk and street, which is a nice touch. There's free Wi-Fi, and I can see Zeke's as being a great place to crank out some work or catch up with a friend.",

I ordered the large iced latte; mind you, I am no coffee epicurean, but the roasted flavor of the coffee beens were very pronounced in the latte. It definitely tastes fresh, unlike the manufactured quality of Starbucks. I got the latte with whole milk, but they also offer non-dairy replacements. They also provide agave syrup to sweeten the latte. I also highly recommend the zucchini bread and chai tea latte, though the latter is quite sweet.  The coffee shop setting is very inviting and hip, yet avoids the basic cliches of other trendy coffee places. My favorite part about the space is that they have a wall full of community events posters; it's great to see this shop celebrating community, yet also staying cognizant of the gentrification that the neighborhood has experienced. I stayed for about 2-3 hours doing work on my laptop, and there were a lot of folks studying or having coffee chats around me. I'm definitely stopping by again soon!",

I ordered a latte and their chocolate chip zucchini bread. The zucchini bread was pretty good however, I found that latte a bit too foamy. However, the smoothness of the espresso made up for it.   When I initially walked into the coffee shop, I felt as though I had transported to a totally different area of the city. It in no way felt as though I was in East Liberty. I had scored a seat in the front by the window. Looking outside, I noticed a huge juxtaposition between the demographics of Zeke's customers versus the people walking by. A hipster coffee shop next to a dollar tree is a picture perfect representation of gentrification if you ask me. Though it seems that management is aware of their delicate role in the changing community. As the only Black person in the shop during my visit, I appreciated their welcoming signs and feature of Black artwork on the walls.",

And the Rhubarb Almond Coffee Cake, which is a huge square ($3), is just begging me to give it a good home. Then, there's the Apple Cider donuts...  Plugged in my phone, and enjoyed a pleasant musical interlude of oldies (yes, before I was born). It's a bit toasty in here,  but the door is open, so it's getting better. Still, I'd rather sit outside, but the only picnic table is in sun, and I have no desire to bake my skin. Also, I have my Luigi's Italian Ice from Dollar Tree.",

    "text": "Zeke's Coffee... It's the best!  A while back I started noticing that my favorite local coffee shops were all using Zeke's. During a recent visit to Baltimore, I was again raving about Zeke's and discovered through the conversation that Zeke's is originally from Baltimore, which led me to do some research and they not only have additional locations in Pittsburgh, but also DC.  Now about the shop itself...I could not ask for a more enjoyable experience every time I stop in here. I'm lucky enough that this location is very close to my work, so I stop in fairly regularly either for a morning coffee or an afternoon pick me up. At either time, there's a sense of busy-ness, sometimes there's a line, but I never wait long. The staff is always extremely friendly and seems genuinely happy to work at a place like this. I don't always tip for my coffee everywhere I go, but I definitely tip here. These guys definitely make your day.  As for the coffee...delicious! The cold brew is also exceptional, as I'm not one to put cream and sugar in my coffee, so I appreciate the smoothness it provides instead of being overwhelming. One thing I've recently discovered is their iced teas. They're not your usual teas, but things like Earl Grey, which I wouldn't think to normally turn into an iced version--but do yourself a favor and try it out!  On top of the great drinks, they also have a variety of sweets and breakfast delights. They now make the breakfast stuff on premise (and I think the sweets too).  I love sitting outside of this place in nice weather on their picnic benches amongst the chill vibe.  All in all, excellent coffee at a totally reasonable price.",

Great place to have a work meeting, and it feels good to support a local small business.   The coffee shop is right on Penn Ave and in the heart of East Liberty. As soon as you walk in, you smell their delicious dark roast coffee. I love the smell of it. Totally wish I could pack the scent up in a candle and take it home with me.   When I approached the counter to order my coffee, on the countertop were a bunch of delicious and savory eats. I chose to get a green bean casserole puff pastry and an apple cider donut with a small coffee. I was on the fence about ordering the green bean casserole, but my friend that I was with convinced me that it was worth a try. Of course I didn't regret it. Yummmy!!! If the thing wasn't already 5 dollars, I would have gotten another one.  It was delicious, but it was definitely not enough for a meal. The apple cider donut also didn't disappoint. It was moist, sweet, and definitely tasted of apple cider. I would recommend it, emphatically!   All in all, great experience. Staff is attentive and it's clean.  Check it out!",

Ambiance: I think Zeke's vibe is a little different than most other coffee shops in Pittsburgh. Favorite thing about the place was that I felt like they were themselves and gave credit where credit was due. On menu items that had their own \"house made chocolate sauce\" or they used a certain brand of whipped cream, they put a little logo by the menu item. Greatly appreciated the extra effort to let me know where my food was coming from, especially when it's local.   Food: We got the chicken, egg, and cheese sammie that they heated up for us in a little oven. It wasn't extremely unique or something you must try but it was good and got the job done.   Coffee: Unfortunately, I didn't love their coffee options so I went for a Carmel latte and it was delicious. They also seemed to have a huge selection of teas, I didn't give any a try this trip, but will be back if I need a afternoon pick me up.   All their roasts are available in the shop and a drive thru that's down the road, if going in isn't always your style.",

    "text": "I traveled a long way to get to Zeke's Coffee (from downtown Pittsburgh), and was fairly disappointed with my experience. The shop was packed, but after my visit, I really couldn't figure out why. Here's a rundown of my experience and why I can't recommend them:  The coffee: The pour-over they made me was one of the worst that I've had from an independent coffee roaster: it really tasted off (almost burnt, but more of a \"dirt\" taste than that) and did not have any real flavor or aroma to it. Additionally, it came in a very small cup and was priced much higher than most pour-overs at other roasters (closer to the price of a specialty bean like a Geisha). In short, I got a very pricey but mediocre (at best) coffee.   The shop: Super disorganized. I am not a big fan of \"stuff everywhere\" style coffee shops (Zeke's isn't the only one like this), and while the place looked clean (as in, hygienic), it was also very cluttered and messy. There is not very much seating inside, and it was all taken when I arrived (but there is quite a bit of seating outside). There were, however, a lot of plugs to charge your personal electronics.   Overall, I wouldn't recommend this coffee shop, and it's definitely not worth a trip from other parts of Pittsburgh. Their coffee is pretty mediocre, and the shop is cluttered and does not have a lot of seating.",

But sadly I wasn't able to get a good seat nor get to try the zucchini bread ): about 10 min later I got a nice seat by the wall with an outlet so that worked out. Seating with outlets are limited!! But I would definitely recommend coming in early for that zucchini bread because the barista told me I was literally 2 min late from the last piece of zucchini bread!! Other than that, Zeke's is a really nice place to study or get work done. It can be a bit dim I would say but when the light shines through the big glass windows of the front of the store, it's a really nice space.   The baristas were friendly and prompt in getting my order in. I actually know the maker of all the pastries and baked goods of the cafe - jihye! she said the pear bread is a new addition to the menu and it's sooo yummy, so go try it out!! I heard the scones are amazing as well so I'd have to go back to try~  P.s. Zeke's has special, cool events every month so be on the lookout for those!! Sometimes they'll have free samples of coffee or their pastries. And they'll have fun activities and just a good time to hangout in their space:)",

You can find their coffee in many stores around the city but this is the only place I know of that will grind the coffee for free. They have on stock a variety of coffees and espresso blends to sell.  In addition they sell espressos, coffee of the day and various pastries. You can even get a T shirt here if you want it. Don't have time to park? They have a drive through nearby which has shorter hours but you can at least grab your coffee and go.  The staff is both friendly and helpful and will let you sample if they have that flavor available for the day. Expect to pay a little more for your pound of coffee but the Royal Blue blend has always been one of my favorites and I use it quite frequently at  home.  Not a coffee drinker? Tea is also available and they have free WiFi. Both indoor and outdoor seating is available. If you do decide to purchase their coffee in bulk then make sure to store in in a dark airtight container in your cupboard. This will help it last longer since the normal shelf life of the beans is about 3 weeks.",

    "text": "The ambiance here is great. And so is the coffee. However, I was disappointed with the food and drink on a recent visit. I ordered a chai latte and a slice of veggie quiche. The latte was prepared timely but was average. It was a bit too sweet for my liking though. Next time I'll probably ask for reduced sugar. The truly sad part of my experience was the quiche. I should have know when it took probably 10+ minutes to heat it up that it was not going to edible. When I got the quiche the top was hard and dry - the inside of the quiche was tough and dry too. The crust was - (you guessed it) hard and dry. The quiche didn't have much flavor at all though the mushrooms were good. In retrospect I should have sent back that quiche right away but I didn't. I totally felt it was a waste of money.",

    "text": "Don't let the 4 Star rating fool you, this place is really incredible!   Zeke's has a wide selection of coffee options that cater to the dietary needs of many. The baristas are super friendly and were really knowledgeable about the coffee and what they are known for. I've visited a couple of times for coffee and once to meet a friend for planning purposes. Each time I've visited for a quick coffee stop, I was in and out relatively quickly. The place is usually pretty crowded with people reading,   working, or chatting, but the line to order is never terribly long. The time I met a friend to plan events, we had a difficult time finding seating. Due to the small space, seating is limited and not always convenient (hence the one-star ding). This can be tough when you are counting on a spot to gather and it is not available. In the warmer months, there are picnic tables outside to use, so the space does expand.  The barista suggested the mocha this last time I was in. It is made with a vegan dark chocolate and is absolutely SUPERB. It was everything you would want in a savory but not too sweet hot chocolate that doubles as a coffee. The chocolate was not overpowering but just enough to make it delicious. I see why they are so well-known for it. Can't wait to go back for another!",

I was delighted to find that the coffee was delicious, the baked goods still warm from the oven, and the staff both relaxed an friendly.  The storefront is tucked a little bit back from the street which allows for some nice outdoor seating in the summer. Inside has a small seating area, but no space problems on a weekday midday. Coffee is ground to order. I admit I am by no means a coffee expert, but my americano was really flavorful and fresh. The blueberry muffin was fresh, great blueberry flavor, and pleasantly less cakey/more yeasty than the usual stuff. For me, that makes for a more satisfying breakfast and less dessert-like pastry.   I thought the staff were great even when it got busy. Internet was fast enough for me to load videos for one of those online training modules everyone loves to do for job requirements. Would definitely recommend checking out Zeke's!",

I always get their lattes and cappuccinos and they're on par with Commonplace, for example. (can't speak for their other coffee.) And slightly better price! Service is normal too, usually two people working on the drinks (more baking behind them). The new place is designed well, which is appreciated since environment is half the reason some of us go out for coffee! It's nice how community-oriented Zeke's is, too.",

Great coffee along with bakery pastries, very reasonable prices. Ended up getting the Macchiato along with the Banananutella Muffin as my carb accompaniment. The Macchiato was delicious ... and not only that, but I could also taste/smell the hint of coffee bean which I really came to appreciate the more I finished off my drink. Not going to lie, but it's pretty rare that most coffee drinks from coffee shops these days have such strong coffee flavor. It was a huge plus for me. As for the Banananutella muffin? ... Delicious. Ingenious combination of banana and nutella. Who would have known that such a combination would taste so darn good in a muffin? The place is also a great place to get work done. Has both indoor and outdoor seating and free Wifi, not to mention plugs at every table in the indoor space. I will definitely be making a return visit to this place",
