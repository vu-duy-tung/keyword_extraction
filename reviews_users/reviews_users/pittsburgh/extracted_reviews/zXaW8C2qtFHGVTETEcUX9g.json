    "text": "So this is the second Cracker Barrel that I have tried, the first one being in Arizona and the second one here near Pittsburgh. Hmmm...Seriously the best part of the experience was the \"chotsky\" country store you have to walk through before and after you eat..., sort of like a minefield filled with every sort of old timey candy, Americana decoration, clothes, candles, flags....yada, yada, yada.   Well,  maybe the food was wasn't the best but I bought some great souvenirs! Anyhow, we had a late breakfast (served all day) and our server was lame at best. She forgot to bring me my coffee and acted offended when I asked her to take it off our bill.   My husband had asked for a ham and cheese dish without peppers and onions and was told by our \"lovely\" server that it was impossible to make it without peppers as it would take to long to pick them out of the mix. She offered him a ham and cheese omelet (not on the menu) and when it arrived our mouths just hung open with surprise.  It was maybe a one or one and a half egg omelet, as flat as my ass (which is pretty damn flat) and had a slice of melted American cheese on too cut in half....Wow! And here I thought cafeteria food was lame!   I had THE lamest sourdough french toast I have ever had, although the bacon was tasty but were two very, very tiny pieces.   All in all, pretty lame and I ABSOLUTELY love it when the server comes over when you are done and gives you a great big smile and says \" Thanks for coming, have a great day\" and slaps the bill on the table. Oy!!! God save me from any more Cracker Barrels in my lifetime.",

I have even considered renting a car and driving to closest Cracker Barrel (which is like, an hour away in the middle of Nowhereville, New Jersey) JUST to taste those elusive pancakes. Don't remember much about our other meals because the pancakes just outshone everything else.. BUT i remember an overall awesome experience. On top of that, they have a novelty/knick knack store to browse while you wait for a table.",

We went because my daughter loves their pancakes, so I thought we'd take a chance. The restaurant looks like all the others, but this one was very clean and well maintained. The service was AWESOME. Our waitress (I cannot remember her name - I'm so sorry), was an older lady, who I was told had been there for some time. She was amazing. Took our drink orders as soon as we sat down, and was back in a jiff to take our order. Food arrived promptly, and I never had an empty glass! I was so impressed, I left a 40% tip. We will be back!",

I love biscuits 'n' gravy!  So, when you walk in, you totally find yourself in the middle of this old timey country store, where you can buy like all kinds of really cool knick-knacks and tchotchkes.  Then, you sit down at this cool table, and you can play with this awesome game with pegs and stuff.  I couldn't figure out the point of it, but it was so much fun, ohmigod.  My grits were so cheesy and awesome--not unlike my favorite movie, Love Actually--and so were the warm caramelized apples.  Ham and bacon were tasty, too.  I, like, totally can't wait to go back to this super awesome restaurant!",

The pancakes were delicious--nice crispy edges.  The eggs were perfect (hard to mess up scrambled eggs, but, it happens so often!) and the bacon was crispy just like I requested.  I really enjoyed the atmosphere of the \"country\" store that spilled into the restaurant.  The grits were bland...but, I have never been a grit-person.  And, the gravy for the biscuit was not the best, but, again, those could be overlooked because I was already pretty full with what I had ordered.  The biscuit, however, was awesome!!",

    "text": "Having grown up in an extremely urbanized environment in California, this kind of store/restaurant is not something that I had access to. While this is a chain, my first impressions of it were quite positive--I rather like the idea of having something resembling an old country Southern establishment, even if done mainly for the nostalgic or touristy effect.  The service is great and friendly, and the menu is pretty extensive. I wouldn't call this kind of food the healthiest that one can eat,, but their fried fish, turnip greens, and cornbread muffin are pretty attractive. The buttermilk fried chicken wasn't all that great, but the menu has so many other things that I will probably go back to try something else multiple times. The gist of the restaurant is that it feels like a classier and more upscale Eat N Park.  The store itself is quite interesting. Selling anything from old trinkets to toys to CDs to snacks, they really do induce a nostalgic feel in you, even if you didn't grow up with any of those things. Before leaving we bought some vintage sodas (4 for less than $5, not bad), with brands that I don't recognize at all. Hopefully will be a good alternative to the highly processed corn syrup drinks nowadays!",

They make the kind of food that you say is \"just like mama or grandmama used to make.\" Which you know isn't True because you realize they were never really that great to begin with.   The country food here is good, which I'm sure you guessed. I love coming in during winter months and sitting by the fire.   The biscuits, gravy, hash browns, catfish, apple butter, grits, pancakes, sour dough bread and sweet, country conversation leave nothing to be desired.   In the summer you can rock in the chairs on the porch and pretend you're Andy Griffith until the elderly lady next to you slaps you in the face for repeatedly calling her \"Aunt Bea\".   I won't do that again... :/",

    "text": "The first thing at Cracker Barrel is that you are going for a certain kind of food and ambiance with a specific client base.   That being said the evening we were here there was a large gathering with a family celebrating what appeared to be the graduation of 2 girls in the family.   At some point in the meal one woman became very agitated and began yelling at another woman at the table.   This proceeded for about a minute before other family members could shuffle her out.   FANTASTIC dinner and a show!   I am sure families that had brought small children who were subjected to the scene and language were appalled but since I was at a table with 3 adults we could laugh about it.   The food was about about average.  I had gotten the shrimp which comes with buttermilk rolls, cornbread rolls, hush puppies and 3 sides.   The one thing I can say is the food you get for your value is very good.    The shrimp was middle of the road, though I have nothing negative to say about the meal as a whole.    The hushpuppies were very good as were the buttermilk biscuits,  I did not partake in the cornbread as the tremendous massive amount of food was too much to eat everything that was brought out to me.      If you are looking for a cheap meal for the family at a good value, this is a good alternative to your typical diner fare.",

    "text": "I'm always a big fan of Cracker Barrel everywhere I go. I am in love with their Grandpa's breakfast with chicken fried steak. This time I had gotten my food to-go, I asked the gentlemen at the host stand to recommend something. One said he hasn't tried much of the food so wasn't very much help (I worked in the service industry and even if you don't eat the food, at least figure out what customers favorites are so you can always have things to recommend, but this is not why I took the 1 star off), the other host said he has tried everything on the menu and recommended the baked white fish so I bravely ordered something new with hash brown casserole, fried okra, and turnip greens as my sides. I took the food back to my hotel, and I find out they didn't give me a fork or napkins. Perhaps this is my fault for not looking in the bag before leaving, but they didn't offer either. Which their location is by the airport next to a bunch of hotels so it should be something they are accustomed to.   Nevertheless, the fish was delicious, lightly breaded with crumbs. The fried okra was average, a few pieces were too dry and burnt. The turnip greens were amazing, it was juicy, soft, and it has a flavorful shredded meat mixed in it. The hash brown casserole was great as always. I will always find a cracker barrel where ever I travel, but I just need to be more mindful about asking for to utensils.  *adding to original post: I went back again to this location and ordered the Meatloaf dinner, something new that I have never tried before. This time as my sides I ordered the turnip greens, sweet baby carrots, and green beans. This time again, I didn't have utensil in my to-go order but I remembered to ask for it before i left. When i opened my order back in my hotel, one thing that was a big difference then my last visit was that my turnip greens was in the same to-go box versus last time they put it in a separate small box and wrapped in wrap because it has so much juice. So a bit of inconsistency there in the to-go system. However, don't let the negatives and small things fool you, I am still a fan of cracker  barrel.",

    "text": "We came here on a whim en route back  from my girlfriend's abode. At first we were going to try Dor-Stop again, but while passing through Robinson or Moon or wherever (?) she says to me, \"Ever been to Cracker Barrel?\"  \"Uh, no. Are we near one?\"  Before I could utter another word, she was switching lanes and charging up a hill.  As I got out of the car, I smelled a campfire. That's when I knew that we weren't at Bob Evans.   As Madre stated in her review, you must bypass a gift shop of sorts to get into the dining area, which I welcomed. Since we were both starving, we waited until after breakfast for the shopping portion of the experience though.  I got Uncle Herschel's Favorite, if for no other reason than you can get catfish with it.  Catfish. For breakfast. With eggs. With tartar sauce yet.   Some people 'round these parts would scratch their heads over such a concept. But methinks The South is onto something here. I chose to have mine fried, but you can also get the fish broiled if you want. You can also get chicken, ham two ways, pork chops, and I think sirloin steak, but leave it to me and my Aquarian dare-to-be-different ways.   You also get Buttermilk Biscuits with Sawmill Gravy (???), two eggs (got mine o'er easy), grits (!!!), and your choice of Hash Brown Casserole and Fried Apples. I got the apples, which are essentially apple pie sans the filling and are therefore...essential. What a way to stay reg'lar y'know?  Now, considering that I got fish with my eggs, grits, and biscuits, I did something that is becoming a lost art; I actually ate everything together one bite at a time. Fish 'n eggs 'n grits function flawlessly together.   And those grits...damn. This was only the second time I had grits, the first being at Cherries Diner in Downtown Pittsburgh. That first time I was underwhelmed. This time?  I now want to eat grits with chili, oysters, chicken, shrimp, beef tips, salmon. I want to put it on a burger. I want to eat it with goulash, gumbo, gravy. I want to form grits into spheres and plunge them into hot lard.   I want grits with everything, anything, every which way I can have them. And all they needed was a pat of butter and a pinch of sugar.   The fish was fork tender, the gravied biscuits stuck to my ribs, the eggs done up perfectly, the fried apples too sinful to be served with a savory meal. I forgot I was at a chain.   This was especially True when I tanked up thrice with their Raspberry Lemonade, served in a godly frosted glass mug no doubt. There was ice on it! A tangy and cold tonic, it was worthy of a Norse God who just slew a Frost Giant. What a beverage. Orange juice? Bah! What's this Coca-Cola I hear about? Speaking of the devil...  Kay and I shared The Double Chocolate Fudge Coca-Cola Cake. How's that for something suvvern bell Paula Dean would conjure?    I asked about it and our fabulous, golden-hearted, supraprofessional server told us that \"it flies out of here it's so good.\"   It's unassuming enough. You get what looks like a Texas sheet cake with icing.  Many places serve a warmed-through fudgy choco-cake alongside ice cream...but none of them do it as well as Cracker Barrel.   Come to think of it, I've heard Coca-Cola bandied about as a killer secret ingredient in chocolate cake, and I can now see why. It makes a chocolate cakeall the more demoniacally dewy and delectable. How such a quaint restaurant can get away with serving something so maleficent is beyond my comprehension. Gullifty's has not a chance.   That ice cream cuts the richness and sweetness like nobody's business, making for quite the Heaven and Hell combo. You can even see the specks of vanilla in their ice cream; a tell-tale indicator that your vanilla ice cream is superior.  I did get to taste Kay's Hash Brown Casserole and almost became envious. Yum-yum gimme some. I'll order it next time.  Onto the gift shop. They have everything from wind-up toys (Kay got some for her grandpa who collects them. I didn't know they could dance too!) and puzzle games to TV shows on DVD and even the new Smokey Robinson rekkid.   I almost bought a Weazel Ball...   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.weaselballs.com%2F&s=b3e14a1c763bfab400e493e75118cfaca79b2baf4cc2b1d4c1d7a28831dc7eef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">weaselballs.com</a>  ...for the cats.   It was like a Johnson Smith catalog come to life!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thingsyouneverknew.com%2F&s=08f7b60aeafc19ab575db0bd3bc26bc67ca9ebb5bd6b566dfac41ed7a86ff19d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thingsyouneverknew.com</a>  And yes, just like J/S, Cracker Barrel sells whoopie cushions.   Go. You'll eat good. You'll get exceptional service from what must be happily dedicated employees (their names are sewn onto their uniforms, and most of the servers looked to be over-30). You'll have a laugh. You'll smile. Go. I mean it.  P.S. Our bill was $23 (not including $5 tip I left) and some change. Had we not ordered dessert, our check would have been under $20. This means that I had one of the most memorable, hospitable, favorable breakfasts ever for just under a 10-spot. I dunno about you, but I think that rules.",

With the old timber styled building, you can smell the aroma of a nice wood burning as you take your first breath out of your car. Continuing to walk towards the building, you make the commitment to not only your stomach but your soul. You step within the establishment to an amazement that is the Old Country Store, which is covered from wall to wall in purchasable material that ranges from clothing to candy. As you approach the hostess station you are greeted with a friendly smile and a \"Welcome to Cracker Barrel, how many today?\" Step by step you are lead to your table where a caring server meets you to take your order. As you wait for your food you have the option to play checkers or the infamous Peg Game that is placed on each table. (Now for the good part). The food comes out steaming on a classic white platter. The taste of a hearty, home cooked meal that only your grandmother could have cooked is in every bite you take. As you take your final bites, you are left with the question: \"Will I come back to this restaurant?\" The answer is, Yes. You will come back. As I have come back, and as my forefathers have come back time and time again.",

I got pancakes.  The bacon for both of our orders was not really edible.  Nasty, too crisp almost burnt. I would have been embarrassed to put that on someone's plate!   I asked for fruit topping for my FRENCH TOAST.  Every other CB I have been to brings the fruit syrup on a bowl on the side.  They brought me pancakes with all of the fruit drenched on top.  I hate soggy pancakes.   I ordered eggs over medium.  Good thing because they were still snotty (whites runny).    I won't visit this location again of the cooks can't cook.",

The only positive part of the entire experience was Ryan, the host. We were immediately greeted, and seated. We were then approached by a young lady, who took our drink order. After receiving our drinks, and placing our food order, we proceeded to wait for a solid 30 minutes, and the only thing that was brought to our table was a salad that a friend of mine had ordered. The server wasn't attentive enough to notice that our food had been neglected, because when it finally reached the table, it was at room temperature. Then had to ask for a manager who apologized, comped the meals, and gave an order to go, for a friend of mine who had to be at work. I, and my friends have agreed to not return to this location. Good luck Ryan.",

Note that those two parties also had two people. To my disappointment,  the meatloaf wasn't as good as I had picture it. I thought that it would come out with gravy or some sauce and the meat looked a bit too pink to my liking. In addition, I also didn't like the corn bread. On the bright side, I was pretty pleased that my meal came with three sides. The meals came out way too fast! My brother had ordered the campfire meal which looked delicious! I personally thought that it was ok. It was a bit too peppery and the waitress had not recommended the dish to an elderly woman sitting behind us. The waitress was nice and kept coming back to our table to make sure that we were doing ok. Overall, I thought that the place was ok as I like the atmosphere but the food wouldn't be my first choice.",

Since we live about 45 minutes away and we all have crazy work schedules, it's hard for us to get together. I decided on cracker barrel this year because I knew she enjoyed it (& I've never been there!! lol)  I ordered the sampler which comes with a slice of meatloaf, chicken & dumplings plus a slice of ham. You get to choose 3 (!!) sides.. how awesome! I chose the hashbrown casserole, country green beans & side salad. I am so thankful that I chose the hashbrown casserole- it was amaze! All of my meal was delicious.  Our server was actually new, but we couldn't tell. The only way were figured this out was by asking what the stars on their apron represented.   I honestly cannot wait to go back to Cracker Barrel!!!",

So although I live back in CA now, I had to bring my bf here last month when we were in town for a wedding.

Their menu contains food reminiscent of ole-time rural meals. Don't be fooled, though; any dish here is guaranteed to stuff you to the brim. Stuff you to the brim with deliciousness, that is. Today I ordered the \"chicken n dumplins\" with two sides: macaroni and cheese, and broccoli. It is safe to say this meal touched every corner of the ole-time country style.  The service, however, is a bit shaky. As the hostess took us to our table, I suspected that things, employee-wise, were not completely organized. All in all, I strongly recommend Cracker Barrel Old Country Store for those who wish to experience a superb recreation of those ole country vibes.",

It was beyond well done its was completely charred outside and had hardly any mayo. The steak fries were lukewarm and the  coleslaw (a side you have no choice on it comes with the burger)  was disgusting (I'm not a slaw fan myself but I do know what it should taste like)  the country atmosphere is honest and not super in your face or superficial (the waitresses aren't dressed up like cowgirls or any such nonsense) but if say stick to breakfast with these guys..

    "text": "Note~~ 2 stars regarding this experience ONLY. Other times have been great service/food.   My mother and I ate here last night after a very long day of not eating and volunteer work. First of all, it took us 10 minutes to be sat. The cashier (Paige) was AMAZING. She was very tentative to us and made sure someone eventually came, after numerous times of trying to 'radio' a hostess in.  When we finally got seated, our server was not very personable and seemed like she just wanted to leave. She got our drinks and everything in a little more than average time, but seemed quite careless. We also felt she rushed the check on us as she proceeded to clean her section, provoking me to ask for a box.   Now the food. mind you we came in an hour and a half before close so there was no need for the half-ass meal. My country fried steak had a film over the gravy, Mac n cheese was cold and stale, and my mashed potatoes consisted of about 2 and a half spoon fulls. Not to mention it was quite apparent I got the last of the friend apples. Now I understand people wanted to get out of here as it as approaching close (still had an hour) but that was just a terrible experience with service, food, and portions. If it wasn't for the amazing customer service from your cashier and her sincerity, I may have complained at the store. You should be treated and served the same at all hours of the day, regarding the time. I found this was a total waste of my money. I will return, but defiantly not at this time of the day and will be sure to notify my friends and family of this terrible experience.",

She highly recommended it to me, telling me it was Southern comfort food. I am always game for Southern food so I agreed. The inside of the store surprised and overwhelmed in the sensed that I didn't expect that there would be merchandise being sold and a restaurant attached to it. The hostess took our name and while we were waiting, played a game of checkers outside which was a fun way of wasting time.   Food-wise, their selection is huge. I had a hard time deciding what I wanted but ended up getting the chicken dumplings. When the food arrived, it was enough to feed a whole family. I will applaud Cracker Barrel for giving a good portion of chicken to the amount of dumplings in the dish. I had been wary about having a 9:1 ratio of dumplings to chicken. The sides were also difficult to choose but I wanted \"lighter\" sides so I ordered hash brown casserole, steamed broccoli, and rice pilaf. I believe all of the dishes come with biscuits or corn muffins and I chose biscuits. The biscuits were not as flaky as I would have liked but there were still good.   I definitely enjoyed the experience but the food overwhelmed me with its heaviness and large portions. You definitely get the most of your money but the food here is just not something I would come back for.",

I was told that it would take 15 minutes and after arriving to Cracker Barrel I was told that my order was not placed .   The employee told me that she had forgotten to place the order and that I would have to wait another 15 minutes. Frustrated and unable to wait because I had my four-legged pet in the car while on this journey. I was really looking forward to my dinner from Cracker Barrel and was really disappointed in their inability to take my order. I mediately downloaded this app so I can make this complaint",

I had the Mama's french toast breakfast with well done bacon, and egg whites.  The eggs were each done perfectly.  The chicken was really good if you like that kind of thing for breakfast.  The well done bacon was actually well done, and the pure maple syrup warmed in my own little bottle was perfect!  We didn't wait long even though the place was busy.  (Just a note - another party wanted to be seated but all of them were not there so they would not seat them.  The hostess apologized but said it was Cracker Barrel policy.)

The turkey--deep fried slices of white meat turkey--did not disappoint. Very tasty and perfectly cooked the way we like it. That's where it ended...the green bean casserole was HIDEOUS--and I'm a pretty forgiving person, but this was terrible! First--it came without the crispy fried onions on top--what on earth??? That's the best part of it!!! Second--the seasoning was DISGUSTING! There was some strange taste that was unbearable--so I politely asked for another side. Waitress suggested baby carrots--which were always very tasty here--NOT TODAY! I swear--boiled, unseasoned, PLAIN baby carrots. The hash brown casserole was dried out. Then there was the biscuits--I actually couldn't help but laugh--nicely piled up burnt, dry biscuits--yay! Well, the water was refreshingly delicious and great to wash down the dried out hash browns and biscuits with! This was a joke and we are not planning on coming back. The only good thing was the more than friendly waitress. I don't know what happened but other than the country store part--this Cracker Barrel went down the tubes, and THIS cracker won't be back.",

I ordered the Southern Trout, and it was so delicious with warm corn and a very sweet potato. We were on our way to the airport, and this is one of the best pit stops that any group or individual can take before landing themselves at the airport back to the west coast. No doubt!  What's better too, is that there is the store right next to it with cute trinkets and little gifts. It's nice to take a look and a good little walk around to digest the meal you just had. I recommend the strawberry lemonade too. Very fresh!  Thanks for a great experience. Can't wait to be back there!",

Noted for their famous rocking chairs for sale out on the porch, you enter into a whirlwind of various clothes, toys, and all types of products for sale.  The place is always crowded but they do offer friendly service. My girlfriend  and I stopped here to celebrate  New Year's breakfast together which is the best meal of the day they are known for. In fact you can order breakfast all day if you want  and if the portion is too much for you then you can order off the kid's menu.  She ordered pancakes with bacon along with hot tea. I ordered scrambled eggs with cheese grits, fruit, tomatoes, and sausage. My tea came in a silver small pitcher which immediately leaked when I tried to pour it into my cup. My friend tried to help me with it but she too experienced problems. We told our waitress and she brought out another one. I noticed that they have several defective pitchers like this because when she ordered a refill she received it in the same pitcher i had before the accident.  We got our food. Her pancakes were burnt and my meal was just fair. I found my sausage a little tough but ate it anyway. She did complain to have the check adjusted. The waitress never offered to bring her a replacement but  made the adjustment anyway.   I had to order takeout for my daughter-yes, take out is available from any menu all day so that was properly prepared and we were given their cornbread and biscuits to take with it.   Each table has their famous \"peg\" game you can play while you wait and in the middle of the restaurant is a nice fireplace with a warm fire going. They even have a small section where two people can play checkers.  When we went to pay the cashier, she asked if our meal was alright. I explained what happened with the pancakes so she called the manager. He was kind enough to take that off the check.   My True rating would have been two and half stars since I feel that they have gone downhill from the days I used to visit. Normally I would eat at one of these restaurants when I'm driving on a trip because they  are located not far from a major exit where you can get on and get off the highway with little difficultly. It may be a while before we return to this location again.  One thing I do like about them is when I'm traveling I get to see the merchandise related to the state or city I'm driving through.  Outside of that, they generally are the same no matter where you go.",

This location is pretty much just like all of the other locations. I just wish there was a separate door to bypass the gift shop as it is always packed and hard to navigate through to get to the actual restaurant.  I have tried quite a few different items on the breakfast menu of the years but my favorite has to be Uncle Herschel's Favorite. It's my favorite as well. It comes with two eggs, grits, sawmill gravy, buttermilk biscuits, fried apples or hashbrown casserole and your choice of country ham, a grilled pork chop, sugar cured ham or a fried chicken tenderloin.  I usually go with grits, biscuits and gravy, hashbrown casserole, a grilled pork chop and I substitute the eggs for buttermilk pancakes as I don't like of eat eggs.  The pancakes are soft and fluffy, same goes for the biscuits, the gravy is delicious,  the hashbrown casserole is out of this world and the grilled pork chop is cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Service is always good and we always leave stuffed and filled to capacity. After we eat we look around the gift shop for a while as you never know what kind of little trinkets you will find.  Then we usually then go over to either IKEA or the nearby Giant Eagle Market District to walk off our food comas.  If you're ever in the area this place is a must stop!",

I was very upset and said I'd never go back.  Well I ended up here at the one in Robinson after a family member convinced me to give it another try.  So we ordered biscuits and jelly, strawberry lemonades, pancake breakfast with cheesy grits, hash brown casserole an eggs over easy. I was pleasantly surprised at how good the food was. Maybe because I just came back form the caribbean where the food was just OK, but this meal was great indeed. Everything was served hot and fresh. My pancakes were nice and fluffy, buttery and came topped with strawberry. I've never had the casserole before but it was decent as well. The biscuits were definitely a hit, especially with jam! YUM!!!  One of my favorite aspects of cracker barrel is their gift shop when you first walk in. So many hand crafted and homey furnishings that it almost makes you feel like your out of town. I will definitely try this location against I'll make sure I'm on an empty stomach first!",

Chicken fried steak, grits, and hashbrown casserole? Are you kidding? Count me in!   The service at this location is excellent. Our waitress was particularly lovely and helpful.   This was the first time I had pancakes at cracker barrel and it was a great decision. The blueberry pancakes with the blueberry syrup were AMAZING. Best pancakes ever. The hashbrown casserole and fried apples are always necessary as well.   The frozen mug apple cider was addicting but I limited myself to just one.   The shop at the front of the restaurant always has a million things I want to buy but I limit myself to one treat each visit. I wish there was a location closer to home!",

    "text": "A family restaurant with a fun gift shop!  The restaurant is pretty spacious and always expect it to be more crowded than it is.  Our breakfast came out in record time.. barely put a dent in my coffee.  I ordered the \"sunrise sampler\" Eggs, grits, fried apples, hash brown casserole, bacon, sausage and ham.  Also, sawmill gravy and biscuits.    It was the perfect breakfast for anyone who is pretty hungry in the mornings.  I didn't finish it all but did sample it all.  The fried apples were delicious and different..  covered in cinnamon.  I liked the ham and bacon a lot but not the sausage so much.  The hash brown casserole was good but too many onions (that's all I could taste). The gravy was a bit odd but ok. Ideal for  those that love sausage gravy.  I had to try one of the pecan pancakes.. outstanding!!!  Our server was great - on the ball.  The price was average for breakfast and do see us returning.  While my boyfriend was paying our check, I enjoyed browsing the gift shop.   Plenty of \"gift\" ideas if you are struggling to find something for a for a special occasion gift.    Thanks Cracker Barrel.. we will be back for lunch or dinner. I will update my review again then.",

There were a lot of people inside however, I was seated as soon as I came in. The service was very fast. I received my food about 10 minutes after ordering.   The person I dined with requested an Arnold Palmer drink, the server said she'd try her best to mix the tea and lemonade together. She brought out the drinks and said if the drink wasn't good, she'd make another one- luckily it worked out. The food was great! Very reasonable and reliable. I always know that I'm going to get a delicious meal at Cracker Barrel. I ordered the grandma platter which contained two pancakes, fried apples, two biscuits, eggs and an assortment of meats. The food was up to par with the price I paid- which was very reasonable. The pancakes were the best part, very fluffy, soaked up the syrup (which was warm) perfectly, and was slightly crispy on the edge. My only complaint was the sausage was a little overcooked, you can see in the picture .. it looks like a hockey puck.",

I have frequented many Cracker Barrel establishments, especially during my college years driving back and forth from New York to Virginia. My go to meal is the chicken tenderloin dinner with sweet baked potato, apple sauce, and baby carrots, biscuits with apple butter, and a slice of Coca Cola chocolate cake to complete the meal. And if you are a real insider like myself, you can ask for this concoction 'smothered' and get something that looks like the picture I included in this post! Best highway stop over one could ask for, and I even venture to say a destination location for a special occasion!",

I got my usual dish of meatloaf with turnip greens and a side salad, but decided on French fries instead of mashed potatoes. The turnip greens were a bit blander than normal (could have used some salt & pepper or other spices) but everything else was spot on.  I also was given a plate with a biscuit & a corn muffin. The corn muffin was a bit dry but my boyfriend enjoyed the biscuit very much.  He got the crispy chicken BLT sandwich and was blown away. He went crazy for the macaroni & cheese and said it was super cheesy and delicious. He also loved the small side of coleslaw, which was fresh, tangy, & still crunchy!   You will not leave hungry at Cracker Barrel. Most entree dishes come with your choice of three sides and a biscuit, and the long list of homemade sides bears something for everyone. The kids will love it, the elderly will definitely love it, and it is just a fun, unique every time.   Also, you will almost never leave without finding something neat in the gift shop. They always have at least one display of 70% off, which is where you'll find me! ;)",

I got in after about 10 minutes wait and asked the waitress what was special for the dinner - I went with her recommendation and ordered chicken gravy with rice and sides of hash browns casserole and kale salad, of course the free biscuits. The chicken and rice was bland with no flavor. I thought may be I ordered the wrong dish and started digging in on the hash brown casserole. It was annoyingly dry and the top was spiking that it almost scrapped my mouth. By this time I had not received the kale salad yet and the waitress told me she would get it. But after a few minutes I got the check and that angered me. I didn't care to remind them for the kale salad the second time. Started digging in the biscuits and same story there - all dried up and cold. Felt like being cheated when I thought of having a warm dinner on a freezing cold night. Left half way without placing any tip. Two stars on because of the location.   To my fellow yelpers, May be I caught them at the wrong time during dinner. But try out at your own risk.

I just had surgery and was in no mood nor shape to cook, and since it is only just the 2 of us we thought why not. We used the online feature to reserve a spot in line and once there we only had to wait 15 minutes. HUGE PLUS! There were soooo many people there and most had over a 2 hour wait, which is ridiculous. The young man working the host/hostess stand was totally overwhelmed, and honestly I'm not sure on a regular day if he would have been any better. Did not seem to be properly trained for that position. Our waitress was really nice, I was expecting that the servers may have been a little stressed from all the activity but from what I saw they seemed to have their \"you know what\" together. They had a special Thanksgiving Day menu instead of their regular one for the day, and we both had already decided on the Thanksgiving Plate. It came with turkey breast, cornbread dressing and gravy, ham, sweet potato casserole, cranberry relish and your choice of side. Also a beverage and a slice of pumpkin pie. All for $12.99, the price can't be beat. They did have a child sized plate for $7.99. It was all very good, a nice sized plate full of food, and we were in and out of there in about 45 minutes. This location does not have a military discount.",

Our food was delicious and so were our sides. The Chicken and Dumplings took me back home to my great aunt's kitchen, like when i was a kid! I will definitely go back to Cracker Barrel for dinner in the future.   We also had great service at this location in Robinson. Everyone was extremely friendly and our food was served quickly.

They have a good, broad menu, stay True to their formula, and you get great value. Great waitstaff (good job, Megan, and good luck with that new house!) - attentive and friendly!  The Pecan chicken meal my buddy ordered looked (and was reported to be) delicious. My Shephard's Pie? Well, the cup of vegetable soup I ordered was pretty good, and I always like the biscuits. The Pie? Seriously...not so much. Visual appeal and tactile presence akin to slurried dog chow. Avoid that, and I'm sure you'll be good to go. Ugh. But I do like Cracker Barrell!",

    "text": "For me, Cracker Barrel is a breakfast place. Never been there for any other meal. I know they serve three meals a day, breakfast, lunch and dinner, just so you know too.  I really do like the breakfast selections which are wide and varied. The menu is a real challenge with so many choices and sides and combinations that they have created for you to select from.  You could also do a la carte if you like to pick and choose your own full complement breakfast.  I'm afraid I can't really speak to lunch and dinner, because I come from their great breakfast.  Blueberry pancakes, oh my god, you cant believe how good they are. Blueberrys out the door for Pete's sake. The most blueberrys I have ever seen in a pancake. Gee Wiz. So good.  Eggs every which way from Sunday. Sausage, Bacon, Biscuits, Sausage Gravy, holy cow.  Lots of sides, hashbrown casserole, \"Fried Apples\" did you every know such a thing, fruit plate, wonderful grits, and what they call 'sawmill' gravy and muffins to bring to light some of the choices.  If you don't leave happy, satiated and pretty full you did something wring, but they do have 'lighter' choices like fruit and yogurt and others on the breakfast, but not for me.  When you check out, at least I do, browse the front store offerings which are pretty 'country' kind of life style and  'lots of stuff'  Can't go wrong here, give it a shot.",
