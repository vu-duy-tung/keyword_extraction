The food on the other hand...not too sure. My date had the chicken pot pie, it was mildly cold and the flavor was alright. On the plus side the presentation of the chicken pot pie was very nice. The Grilled Chicken Thighs...everything was cold, but I guess it's served that way? That should possibly be stated on the menu.",

I have never been to a restaurant where everything they served was just darn right bad! The soup came out cold and clumpy, the brussel sprouts were mushy and greasy, the wings were way overcooked (burnt on one side)and had no flavor, the brisket was ok but I couldn't eat it because the bread that it was on was so hard and burnt I couldn't bite into it and the ff were soggy! Even the ranch had no taste. In sorry but I just wouldn't recommend this place to anyone to eat.",

And it's a \"pub\" price point for food you would get at a fine dining restaurant.  Shared the pork belly bites as an appetizer.  More than we could eat.  Perfectly cooked.  (I had the leftovers for breakfast  the next day.). Also had the Salmon which was delicious.  And there was something under the salmon - I really cant describe it, but it was DELICIOUS.  My dinner companion had the \"chicken thighs\" which were really 2 chicken legs. The waiter, I think his name was Kia, was excellent.  Explaining the food and the beer with a great deal of passion.  I will go back next time I am in the area.  Also we were there during happy hour.  Appetizers were $3.00 off during Happy hour.  And the drinks were discounted as well.",

The smoked wings with the house hot sauce were delicious. In my opinion, Stout has the best draft menu in the area. Most of the selections were from the Pittsburgh area. We will definitely be back!",

Good selection of beer.   I was not impressed with the Pork Belly bites.  The menu indicates the belly is confit but it looks like it's been in a deep fryer, thus lacking some flavor.  I imagine it's confit before service and then fried right before serving?  I thought the belly was under seasoned, as I had to salt it.  Even weirder is they drop RAW blueberries, blackberries, and raspberries in the bowl. I understand that fatty pork belly always goes well with some kind of sweet/acidic sauce, but they missed it here.  A chutney or jam with concentrated flavors is more appropriate I would believe.",

The menu looks great on paper but that's where 2 stars fall off. I got \"smoked\" wings that were hardly smoked at all, some of the best fried wings I've ever had but no smoky flavour. My server Harley was great and very attentive to her tables, the two stars are for her. The caesar salad did not live up to the description on the menu. House dressing was missing the salty anchovy flavour. I heard that the place just opened a month ago, hopefully the can pull it all together.",

I couldn't hear one word the person I was with was saying. The acoustics are horrific. On top of that, the booths they kept back there are clearly from the previous restaurant. Really, The Yard? You don't have enough money to buy new booths? DO NOT sit back there if you can avoid it.  We got the smoked wings and pierogis. The pierogis tasted like oil and that's about it. The wings were very good, but similar to most smoked wings at most restaurants. The beer selected wasn't anything that I was expecting. Not a big variety, in my opinion.",

The beer list is surprisingly small for a place called \"Stout\" but they did offer a few stout beers. The menu left a lot to be desired as well. I didn't order a sandwich but from what I could see from the people around me, they're mostly bread. I had pasta and chicken, which was possibly the driest thing I've had in a long time. If either the pasta or chicken had any moisture to it at all I could've pushed through. The current vegetable selection reads like a frozen mixed back of Birds Eye veggies at the grocery store. The only bright spot besides the service was the appetizer. I'm hoping they have a rotating menu so that there'll be something worth trying in another couple months. If the menu doesn't change, I won't be back.",

Really love that their menu is hyper local and that their bar also pushes local brewers and distillers. All the food we had was good to very good. My favorite item was probably the pork belly bites, perfectly crispy with a nice sweet sauce. The brisket and pastrami sandwiches were good as was the burger. I do find the prices to be a little bit high for a dying strip mall in Robinson, being owned by The Yard, I feel that they priced their menu more accordingly with downtown or shadyside. Also our service was very average. Our waitress was nice and attentive, but made numerous mistakes. We live in Greentree, so we come to Robinson a fair amount, and Stout will be in our rotation, but I don't think we would make a special trip just to dine here. For the money, I believe there are better offerings elsewhere.",

The chicken salad was so good and the fries were excellent. I requested a side of ranch and their ranch is a herby homemade which I loved. My friend got the brisket pierogis. She enjoyed them but wished that there was a little more sauerkraut that came as a bed underneath.  The staff at Stout is awesome. Everyone was really nice and attentive. They have weekend brunch and also a special pick 2 lunch menu for weekdays. There is a fine beer selection and also a great page of fresh cocktails. I opted for white wine this time,but I will be enjoying cocktails on my next visit. I will definitely be back to try more things off the menu!",

    "text": "First off -  I really wanted to like this new restaurant.  With so many chains in Robinson, it was awesome to see something 'local' get launched.  Unfortunately, Stout overall fell incredibly short of expectations.    Service:  Service was good and our server was attentive.  Although we were told several times that we had to 'be done' by 630 as a large reservation was coming in.  Food/Drinks:  We started out with a local whiskey and beer.  The whiskey was at best an ounce, if that.  Very short pour.  The beer was fine and the prices, with happy hour, were fair.  We started with deep fried risotto balls.   Wasn't terrible and was the overall highlight of the meal.  Our main courses however were an absolute disaster.  Upon ordering, we were told the Pierogis were out (this was 4pm on a friday) so we went with their burgers ($14 a piece) and our kids went with a pizza /hot dogs.  We were then told that they didnt have any ketchup for the burgers or fries?  Our burgers had zero flavor and were burnt (asked for medium well). It literally tasted as someone just rolled up some ground meat and grilled it up.  When you are charging $14 for a burger, I'd hope it would have SOME type of seasoning/flavor. My sons pizza was nothing more then a red baron microwave pizza (literally, thats all it was). I wasn't expecting a masterpiece but there was zero effort into making.  Also the price was near 8 bucks for it?!  The hot dogs were clearly microwaved as well.  Fries were good but dry (no ketchup).  That being said we, we won't be back.  When you have restaurants like Burgatory (cheaper and way better burgers) and Industry (larger selection of drinks and better food) there is no reason to return.",

However, this restaurant definitely fails to meet my expectations, especially for the premium that they charge for their meals. You expect me to pay $32 dollars for a Scallops dish and give me a plastic cup for water and paper napkins? That's bold... That being said, the scallops we very good but the rest of the frills on the plate were very lack luster. The Furniture also resembles the same stuff they use at chipotle. Definitely not worth the money.",

I wanted some pate or terrine. What I got was really small portions of store-bought salami, about an ounce (literally) of smoked salmon, 4 triangles of packaged pepperjack cheese (how exotic), some slivers of cheddar cheese, and some toasted french bread.  Nothing was homemade--all low quality stuff you can get at any mediocre supermarket.  When I saw the plate, I asked where the pate and terrines were? \"Oh, we changed it.\" I said this is fraud. \"I'll let them know.\"  Well, I don't know who \"them\" is, but I'm letting the rest of you know that this place doesn't seem to care if its food doesn't even remotely match the menu's description. And clearly the staff did not care about my complaint.  2 other guests had dinner salads, salmon, chicken, that looked OK. They seemed happy FWIW. Me? I'll go somewhere else.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of Gastropubs and after reading reviews and glancing at the menu I chose this place to dine at with a friend. We both got the flank steak salad which was highly suggested by our waitress. Just when I thought that it wasn't possible to mess up a steak salad I was proven wrong. Visually it looked appetizing enough but for $16 the portion was more akin to an appetizer than an actual meal. I never can finish anything that I order at a restaurant including a steak salad. Not only did I finish this but I had to make plans on where to eat afterwards. In retrospect it was a blessing in disguise that the portion was small since it was barely palatable and I left more than a few of their \"candy\" tasting tomatoes behind.   So where did this dish go wrong? Way too much sugar; why any at all? Why do the tomatoes taste like they were candied? Why did the dressings (blood orange and another that I will assume was balsamic vinaigrette) taste like liquid sugar? I know how to make a vinaigrette and this was not it. The portion size compared to the price was way off, especially given the poor execution of the dish. Finally unseasoned flank steak; did anybody think to even salt and pepper it let alone add anything else? The salsa verde tasted like fresh from the can.The only reason that I did not complain and send this back was because I was on a first date and wanted to focus on that in a positive way. My date also found the dish to be sugary as well. Afterwards we agreed that we should have went elsewhere. My verdict is if you can't master a simple dish then I don't have faith that a more complicated one will be completed either let alone mastered.",

They cure their meats in house and you could tell with the pastrami. Cool preparation for sure.  Table next door got the wings and we couldn't resist. Smoked first and then cooked to perfection. More rye for desert. We will be back soon",

The food and service were really good. The menu doesn't mention that the fries are steak fries and sadly none of the fries (steak or sweet potato) were crispy - the oil was clearly not warm enough - probably because a LOT of the items on their menu are fried. They also have only a horrible sounding vegetable medley as an alternative to fries, which seems odd. I don't like sweet potato fries or steak fries, so I was out of luck. Maybe they'll come up with a reasonable alternative once they've been open a bit longer.  The menu is annoying (one-sided and tons of pages) and they've already raised prices on a couple things, though we went there less than a week after they opened, but we'll return. The beer list is sideways in the binder, too. Hopefully, they'll fix some of these issues and mention that their fries are really steak fries when they reprint. The menu is just printed on regular paper, so I'm sure they'll work on it.",

Wait was estimated to be 45 minutes for 2 however we were seated as soon as our drinks came up at the bar. They escorted us to a back room, which must have been added on during the ownership change as a private party room... maybe 30x20 seating 20 people with 5 tables. This was the loudest dining experience we have had. If seated in this back room we strongly recommend asking to be moved.   We split smoked wings (with ranch, hot & mild sauce on the side) they were phenomenal. Pierogis and a pastrami sandwich with sweet potato fries on the side. Beer selection was strong, no 12oz beer glasses though with 12oz pours.. so the beers looked 3/4 full when ordering.   The food was great and overall an experience we might consider again if it were not for being seated in this back room.",

    "text": "My wife and I went there last night. We were big fans of the previous location that used to occupy the same space. That being said we enjoyed how open the new owners made the space.   The beer selection was good and included a small number of local brews. The happy hour lasts until 6PM. Drinks and appetizers are best priced during that time. We ordered the fried pork belly and thought that it could have been fried a little more. The skin was not as crisp as it could have been.   The main entrees we got was the chicken thighs ($16) and the brisket sandwich ($14). We will start with the good and that is the brisket sandwich! It was amazing. That is what got the 3 stars here. That was really good and had enough food for one person. The bad is the chicken thighs. Those were dry and can be replicated at home with little effort. The small potatoes that came with them was ice cold. Literally ice cold. The waitress was really apologetic and corrected it right away.   The waitress was really nice and very good. The atmosphere was very loud, first daters should be aware. You can't have a conversation about anything there.  Overall a solid three stars and has room to improve. The staff is good but the space could use a little sound dampening. The back of the house could use a little quality check. Total check was $71.00 including the tip for 4 beers (2 half price), 2 meals, 1 appetizer (half price).",

I'm not picky but most of their food had odd flavors or lack of flavor all together. My boyfriend got the pheasant which was literally the size of a chicken wing with four small round potatoes on the plate. Ridiculous for what you pay. The waitress also forgot everyone's drinks at our table at some point. She would come back with one person's beer and the rest of us would be waiting with empty drinks for the next 15 minutes waiting for her to come back. Nothing here to bring me back.",

I'm not a cocktail guy but had a swig of the \"Toasted\" cocktail...great coconut rum drink with cream bourbon.  I could drink this for breakfast, lunch, or dinner...really tasty.   Robinson was in need of some more non chain, unique locations. When bocktown closed, I was super bummed out but this is a great replacement.   Only thing is I wish the menu had a little more variety and options.  I live about 2 miles away and I'd love to come back weekly but the menu isn't extensive enough for me to come back for dinner anytime soon. I will be back for drinks for sure!",

I've had the corned beef, pastrami, and brisket sandwiches and they really can't be beat. They are each dressed up differently, with mustards or krauts (one even has a bacon jam!) and the bread is SO GOOD. The fries (sweet potato or classic potato) are clearly house-cut and are delicious. They have a great selection of local beers and the happy hour is great (half off all drinks and $3 off apps, not including the charcuterie board). I'm looking forward to trying their selection of mains, which aren't available until after 4 pm. This place is halfway between work and home, so I can see myself getting into some trouble here. Great new place, go check it out!",

Now, I do understand that caramelizing will bring out the sweetness but they were beyond carmelized. They had a definite burnt flavor.  The wife ordered the chicken salad on briosch. The chicken was very tasty but the bread was too hard. This would've been better served on something a tad softer. She opted for the soup which was  walleye chowder. The portion was dinner size and she only ate half so as not to spoil her appetite. She said it was \"amazing!\". It must've been because I can always count on having here take homes for dinner the next day, when I looked for it, it was fine. She took it to work for lunch.i also tried the pork belly bites which was first time trying pork belly and I found it just ok. That portion was pretty damn huge too for an app. Apps are definitely for sharing. Great beer selection too. I would recommend.",

I like mine a little more crispy. The Brisket pierogi was an awful greasy skillet of mush.    Then we ordered another round of drinks and she only brought mine. Later asked if he'd like another and at that point he just said no.   Next, our food came. My salmon was completely raw so I asked for it to be cooked more. It took 20 min. The salmon quinoa salad I ordered was a salmon fillet on top of a handful arugula, quinoa, and blueberries for $16.   In the meantime I figured I'd try his brisket sandwich because it looked good. It was cold and dry. I had to ask twice for extra sauce.   I'm always understanding especially being in the service industry but the restaurant was not overly busy.  We won't be returning and I would never recommend this place.  Very unimpressed.",

Not only did he recommend great beers/cocktails - he was VERY attentive and helpful when it came down to ordering/making sure we were extremely happy with our food.  Again, ordered pretty much everything on the menu (appetizers, main entree, and even dessert)   I was very, very happy with the food and service this time around. The drinks were also great.  Only downfalls, the menu is a bit over priced - and like I have said in my past review, location is a little silly. Tucked way back in an abandoned plaza near Robinson town center.  Would recommend this place to anyone local - or traveling to/from Pgh. from the airport. Can't beat the fresh food & drinks!",

Their prices are a little much especially in the area they are located but overall good food and I absolutely loved the variety of different brews they had for their flights.   The Mojito Lime Cider was one of my favorites has you can taste the mint and lime in it. Definitely try their coffee brews such as Java Head and States they both have different flavors but were really good as well. My coworkers loved the Just Peachy beer, which I thought was ok. There is definitely a beer for everyone even the ones who do not drink beer.   Their wings were good in flavor, could be a little more crispy. The fries were really good, both the sweet potato and regular. I had the smoked brisket sandwich which was amazing with the apple slices and the bacon jam it gives it a unique flavor and the brisket was not dry at all. Plenty of space to hang out at and they have a outside area as well.",

    "text": "Hey everyone!     Let's address the elephant in the room.  The location of Stout pub sucks. It is in Robinson, but it's tucked in and hard to find, plus the sign is tiny.  Had I not read the review on Yelp, I would of never tried the place.  Now on the to good stuff. Before you even enter the front door, the place smells amazing. It has a camp fire, bourbon, wood grill smell, that draws me in like a moth to a bug light. Once in the front door, the smell only gets better.  We were greeted and seated quickly. The waiter fetched us some water and explained the menu.  He informed us they have been only open about a month. They, as much as possible, use Pennsylvania sourced food and liquor.  Plus they source their food locally and are a farm to table restaurant. They also smoke their own meats and home make a lot of other items. The decor is steam punk/hipster, it works well and seems well designed.   The food:  We ordered the brussel sprouts for an appetizer.  I have a serious brussel sprout addiction. These were very good. They were  just the right amount of soft and crispy, with a soy-ish sauce and home made pancetta.  I highly recommend this app.   Lunch:  I ordered the pastrami sandwich and my date ordered the chicken salad sandwich. My sandwich was very good. It was paired with stone ground mustard, some greens, and those little pickled radishes.  I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Both meals were very good.    So all in all this place is worth trying. The new decor is very popular right now, and I always feel a little hipster when I eat somewhere like this. The homemade and locally sourced foods and liquors make me feel good about supporting PA. It's nice to see something like this in the south/west hills.  If you like Cure in Lawrenceville, you'll definitely like this place.",

Happy hour is from 4-6. They were out of a few things tonight. I had the Stout Burger which I thought was pretty average. It was a weirdly shaped burger, the patty was like a ball. Made it kind of awkward to eat. But it was cooked well. The fries weren't very warm. Overall, if you're looking for one of the few non-chain options in the chaotic and overcrowded Robinson, this place is worth a try, maybe I just hit them on a bad night.",

He asked our names, was super friendly, made great suggestions and also makes a mean Loddy Toddy. I don't know who was there when people got the stink eye, but it wasn't this group. They were fun and engaging.  Food. The bomb. We had pierogies and wings to start (Owners: get blue cheese. Just do it. I'm bringing my own next time if not. :) ) Then split a brisket sandwich that neither of us could put down. Drippy and delish. We also split fish and chips. Also great, but I was so stuffed I could barely take two bites.  They pride themselves on being strictly local. Food from local farms, beer and spirits from local breweries/distilleries. I love Pittsburgh, and I love local.  Can't wait till the patio opens and we can come BACK! John said he would save us a spot at the patio bar. Okay, He didn't, but I hopes he reads this and does so anyway. :)",

    "text": "Was deciding between this place and another so we decided to go here mostly because I wanted the charcuterie plate with the pate. When we actually got our board I was very disappointed with the size of it for $15. And there was no pate that I was looking forward to it. The three cheeses were all white and firm so that was disappointing to not have different contrasts and textures in something like this. Also seemed very light on the meats for the price. I did like the berry compote and the pickled onions. Those were nice touches.   We split a house salad. Very good. Loved the raspberry dressing  We also split a brisket sandwich. I asked for extra bacon jam on the side because who doesn't love bacon jam? This was good but I wouldn't call it jam. It seemed more like some bacon pieces in syrup. I was glad to have it though because to me the brisket sandwich seemed dry although my husband said it seemed more flavorless. They didn't have barbecue sauce which we thought was strange if they had brisket but the bacon syrup did help to moisten it and give more flavor so we did end up enjoying that and liked how thinly sliced it was.   Service was great! The bartenders were nice and knowledgeable. I will admit we did not mention any of our issues with them because we were in a bit of a hurry and they were busy.   I would like the owner to take Pate off the description for the cheese board though. I noticed there was a post 7 months back with the exact same complaint I just had. I looked at the online menu and again on the menu at the location as it's on both. I would also make it bigger or cheaper as to not feel ripped off.   Decent dining experience. Not sure if I will return or not",

    "text": "Was just as surprised to see Stout open as I was to see its predecessor closed.  All new menu and beer options but a familiar gastropub lean.    The pros: Service was great (though it was not particularly busy) Food was great Farm to Table Local/sustainable  The cons: Price (more than your usual lunchtime dine and dash, especially in the Robinson area) Location (maybe this is a plus if you want a \"find\" but nobody is going to see this restaurant who isn't looking for this restaurant.)  I'm eating healthy these days, so I didn't sample Stout's nominal strengths:  house cured and local meat, and local beer and spirits.  At this point everyone in Pittsburgh should know that you can populate a menu in any decent restaurant with food that is locally grown/sourced.    So too, more than ever, brewpubs and ciderhouses.  I didn't do a deep dive into Pittsburgh microbreweries but did enough to know there are 50+ in an hour and a half radius of the city.  You could drink a new beer every day and not have the same beer twice for a year.   But working, and trying to be \"healthy\"...I steered clear of cured meats and microbrews, and there's probably another star to be had for a drunker, less healthy reviewer.    I had a quinoa, salmon and arugula salad.  It was a nice balance of savory salmon on peppery greens with a dash of acid bright vinaigrette and sweet refreshing blackberries.  The quinoa was marinated, and, as someone who hasn't really eaten a lot of quinoa...I found it mixed nicely with the overall salad, and I felt healthier for having eaten it.  It filled me up nicely too.  I didn't notice upon entry, but after I'd left there was a faint scent of cured meats that lingered on my clothes.  It wasn't off-putting, in fact, I've been smelling myself off and on for the rest of today.",

Stout is from the same owner. In fact, they will be opening another location of the Yard next door to Stout.  There is a great selection of local brews and whiskeys. We did not try the cocktails (it was Sunday night), but they sounded great.  We started with the charcuterie. The meats were smoked in house. The duck prosciutto was all kinds of fatty goodness. The cheeses were local. The pickles and pickled radishes, which are made on site, rounded out the plate. I had the stout stew, which was delicious.  My spouse had the deviled Caesar salad for her entree. She was very pleased. I had the chicken pot pie, mostly because I assumed that it would be a smaller portion. I was wrong. It was huge. It was made with chicken that they smoke in-house. It came in a rich gravy. The portions at this place, in general, are big.   The food is well executed. The drinks are great. We are so glad this place is close.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect, because other reviews seemed to rate highly on food but poorly on service/wait, but my co-workers and I were having difficulty finding restaurants near our hotel that weren't part of a huge, national chain.  We visited on a Wednesday night and were immediately seated; the restaurant was about half full while we were there. Our server very quickly stopped to take beverage orders, which also arrived quickly.  It seems like we were not a victim of whatever issues may have affected other reviewers!  One co-worker and I both ordered the pan-seared salmon (one medium rare and one medium well) and my other co-worker ordered the braised lamb shank.  I also ordered a house salad to start. The house salad was good, with the one big positive being the pickled vegetables: you get various veggies on your salad everywhere, but the tart addition of the pickling was a nice touch. My co-worker who order the lamb thoroughly enjoyed her meal: it was a good size and she said it was well prepared.  The two of us who ordered the salmon also enjoyed our meals, but both of us were a little annoyed with the large pearl onions.  When the waiter told us that the seasonal vegetables on the menu included pearl onions, I expected them to be of a size that I could easily eat them in one bite: that was not the case.  As you can see in the picture of my plate, we instead ended up with a very large, very round, very unstable vegetable that was incredibly difficult to stab with your fork and then cut without sending it flying across the restaurant.  If the onions are always that large, I would suggest cutting them in half in the kitchen so your guests are not assaulting each other with flying onions (or just leaving them on the plate like my co-worker did).  Overall, an enjoyable meal with great tastes that I would be glad to repeat in the future.",
