Each server, including bar tenders and managers are all friendly and truly care about your experience there. I definitely would recommend Bar Louie North Shore to any one!",

As somebody who's worked in the service industry before, I can assure you their service is second to none. We were welcomed at the door, immediately taken care of by Andy at the bar, and our food and drinks were served promptly. I'm not usually inclined to leave reviews, but these guys get it and deserve to be recognized. One of the female managers Stephanie was also very nice and made sure we enjoyed our experience.  I think this review says it all.",

Still, there was no host/hostess, tables were full of uneaten food and nothing was bussed or cleaned. We sat ourselves and a server finally showed up. While the server was fine, the drinks we ordered took forever and there were only two other tables with patrons. We ordered nachos and calamari, both which came quickly but were literally disgusting. The calamari was extremely burnt and the nachos were cold and covered in the most disgusting excuse for guacamole I'd ever seen. I did not have any expectations for a place like this on the \"North Shore\" and luckily Bar Louie proved right. Never. Again.",

I'm not sure what she was doing but she was so slow. As it picked up a bit she seemed to get in the weeds pretty fast. Icing on the cake was when I asked for their gluten free menu which Bar Louie has she had no clue what I was talking about. Either she's just clueless or their training is terrible. Either way, I left and had dinner next door instead.",

    "text": "\"The absolute worst service we've ever had in our life\"..... this is the quote from my lady friend as we drank at this horrible bar. Only giving it one star, because i can't give it 0 stars. We have given bar Louie 3 chances in the timeframe of one week. Where should I begin.... actually on all of our visits, we noticed that Bar Louie was the only bar on the north shore that wasn't full of people. I guess that should have been a sign.   On visit 1, we asked for a couple of basic martinis off of the menu. One was basically all mix, and pretty awful tasting. The other was defiantly not the vodka i had asked for. We would have ordered a second round, but it appeared that the bar staff were more interested in cleaning and stocking the bar at 10 pm on a Friday night than waiting on any of the customers that were at the bar.   On visit 2, (again on another Friday night), we decided to try to grab some food before the Pirates game. We were able to be seated immediately on the patio, where our group waited for nearly 20 minutes before a server stopped by and said \"i guess i can take your order if you want something\". It took forever for our drinks and food to arrive.  After we had drinks at several other bars after the Bucco game, our party ended up at Bar Louie, again, because it was pretty much empty and there were tons of bar seats. However, one very apparent person there was a Pittsburgh police officer that pretty much just kept circling the bar, watching patrons, while only about 10 people were in the whole joint. It set a strange vibe, as there were no other police roaming the much more crowded bars on the north shore. Around 1230am, it was pretty apparent that the bar staff was really wanting to close. They were mostly making poor attempts to look busy sweeping or cleaning, while ignoring all new customers, and also ignoring giant tubs of disgusting dirty dishes were laying around behind the bar, and more dirty dishes were laying all over the bar. When we were able to flag down a bartender, she again made us two basic martinis off of the menu. She handed them to us, where i promptly noticed that something black was floating in my fiancee's drink. The olives in my Martini were disgusting, and very old tasting. It was pretty gross. Her drink was replaced with something different, when the lights in the whole place came on full bright at about 12:55. People walking in after this were refused service and turned away. Just a few minutes later, last call was given, even though it was about an hour from closing time. It was all very odd.   All in all, we usually like Bar Louie's apps and drinks, but this location is just awful, pretty much because of the staff and atmosphere they set. This is clearly the reason this bar is nearly always empty compared to surrounding places. We look for it to be closed soon If this level of service continues.",

We sat ourselves and proceeded to order some beers from the friendly waitress. The unfortunate thing was they were out of a lot of the various beers. Then, we went to order appetizers and guess what they were out of a few of those too! How does that even happen? The north shore is definitely happening on the weekends now so why wouldn't you be prepared appropriately? Anyways, when the appetizers came out, they were luke warm and mediocre at best.

He started us off with the Thai and the Chicken Verde flatbreads (which I probably wouldn't have ordered on my own), and they were amazing!!  The spinach artichoke dip was also very good.

Sharing this because there are a lot of choices in the north shore, and this place should be embarrassed.   Let's start with the service and the restaurant itself. Absolutely disgusting. There is no hostess so you kinda seat yourself. No problem but maybe put a sign up or something so people aren't just waiting there.   Floor was sticky and there was trash everywhere. I get it was a busy day earlier, but at least make an attempt to keep up with it. Bathrooms were also absolutely disgusting. Waitress took about 15 minutes to even acknowledge us. Ordered drinks. 20 minutes later, nothing. We ended up going to the bar to get some waters ourselves in the meantime.   Ordered a Moscow mule, which, after taking forever to even get there, tasted like chemicals. Everyone who worked there seemed to be standing around. When our drinks did not come, we went up to the bar as previously mentioned, and the bartenders were more interested in flirting than caring about the customers. We waited there several minutes before either acknowledged us, or stopped feeding French fries to each other to notice we were there.   Food took a very long time, and the restaurant was not crowded at all. We ordered nachos. I think they would have been okay if they weren't cold. Obviously they'd been sitting out for a while before coming to our table. Ordered a chicken sandwich which was burnt. No one else seemed thrilled with their food in our party, everyone was just hungry so we are it.   Not a positive experience, they should be ashamed of how they treat their customers, I'm surprised this place is still open. Plenty of other north shore bars, there's no reason to go here.",

    "text": "We went to Bar Louie on Saturday afternoon, March 24, 2018 and had a great meal. I am wondering why this location has such a low Yelp rating.??? The place was not busy on Saturday because nothing was really going on in town. We sat ourselves, which is customary I suppose when they're not busy, and not a problem at all. We were my daughter, her boyfriend and me. We ordered apps (chicken lettuce wraps and the hummus platter) which I thought were very good! For lunch, my daughter went off-menu and got a macaroni and cheese with chicken SANDWICH! She loved it! Her boyfriend got the pulled pork sandwich platter and he really liked it. I got the blackened cod tacos which came with rice, black beans, pico, guac and the BEST verde sauce I've ever had. I even asked the waitress to let the kitchen know I said that and she did. The kitchen manager came out to chat and thank us for the compliment.  I don't know what some people's problems are with this place but we had a great meal during an off time and still got fresh, house-made food! We will definitely be back! Thank you!",

The menu was original and presented a wide variety of options that could satisfy any level of appetite, from slightly hungry to starving. The cocktails were creative and original. I recommend the Royally Buzzed cocktail; I've never had anything quite like it. It's slightly pricey, but contains ALL of the liquor and is definitely worth it. Highly recommend this restaurant!!",

I went for an alleged \"Arts and Crafts\" event where they were supposed to have ARTS (crayons, paper, etc.) and CRAFT Beers galore, plus $5 Impossible Burgers. They had 1 of those, and unfortunately it was the Impossible (To Eat) burger. As a longtime vegan, I was looking forward to a thick, juicy plant-based burger, and was incredibly disappointed when an over cooked, crunchy patty on a bun with wilted lettuce showed up at my table. I had to chase down a hostess to get silverware and napkins for the table, after the food arrived. Louie, I wish you the best. I will not be back.",

The chicken quesadilla was good the first time (except the guacamole is like no guacamole I've ever seen - whole chunk of avocado, really dark green, really not good), but the third visit, it was burnt and dry.  The chicken nachos come with a ton of toppings (incl the weird guac), but somehow still have no taste.  The dip also had very little taste, and the chips were stale.  The third visit was at 2 PM on a weekday, but they had the \"Event Menu\" on the table.  The Event Menu is really limiting, so I asked the waitress, \"Is this the menu for today?\"  and she said yes, but then huffily said, \"Do you want a regular menu?\"  You either offer the full menu, or you don't.  We were the only people in there, and I feel like they just wanted to stick with the smaller menu.  The menu she brought me was sticky, with soda spilled on it.  Like, the pages were stuck together, and the first two pages actually ripped when I tried to turn the page. I resorted to the Event Menu because I didn't want to touch that thing any longer.  The kids' meals say that they come with a dessert.  The first visit, they brought it right out.  The second time, I had to request it, and the waiter seemed confused.  The third visit, the waitress brought out the check and never mentioned it, and I just wanted to leave.    Cost for me and two kids was about $50 each time.  WAY overpriced.  Never again.",

We were obviously in a rush with our pirates gear and the game starting at 7:05, and tried ordering our food and drinks at the same told and our waiter told us that we couldn't. After an hour of waiting and our waiter never came over to see how we were doing if needed anything, finally he came over and told us that our food be right out, and asked again what one of us ordered confusing what they ordered with a salad instead of a sandwich like they had ordered. 15 more minutes pass by and our waiter is avoiding our table, and seeing people who has sat down long after us receive their food, the manager comes to tell us again, that our food will be right out and asks us if we need anything, and we state that we are good on water and drinks. He brings us out chips and salsa. Another 15 minutes and I finally get my chicken Caesar salad, no one else got their order, and I got my entree before my appetizer. 10 more minutes and my friends finally get their sandwiches and I get my spinach & artichoke dip which the chips were not totally cooked and honestly Applebee's has a better spinach and artichoke dip. My friend's fries were cold and yet again entrees before appetizers. Our one friend still didn't receive their food. At this point it's 7:20 and we've gotten half of our order after putting it in over an hour before. 7:30 and we all have our meals and appetizers, yet our waiter never bothers to come over, ask if there is anything that can be cleared, refills needed, or how the food is. Finally our waiter comes over to hand us coupons for free appetizers at our next visit, I can promise you I will not be returning, so if you're looking to be a half hour late, starving, and thirsty, I have a free coupon for you. Hit me up.",

The manager came over and took our drink orders. We were seated near the bar and the kitchen. It took 20 mins to get our drinks. We watched the bar staff touch ever garnish including ours and a server licking her fingers as she delivered food. We ordered a second round of drinks. My husband was given a smaller beer in a plastic cup but charged the same price as the larger beer. No explanation for this. We counted 21 staff members and only the bartenders and 1 waitress, whom wasn't ours, was actually doing much work. 50 mins after arriving we received our food. A chicken sandwich 2 burgers and a Tuscan chicken pasta. Evertthig was cold except the fries. We complained to the manager but he only offered us a basket of fries. We declined and asked for the bill. That took forever also. We spent 2 hours there with the worst service I have ever experienced, cold food, and unhappy waitstaff. All that we could do was laugh about it.",

The one lady I was with wasn't crazy about her meal, the server was super nice and brought her another meal to go.   Tonight we came just for drinks. The bartender was so weird it was uncomfortable. A guy who was obviously training came up and asked him what a drink was and his reply was \"I hate that drink, I refuse to make it\". He then started making a drink with Titos, the bottle ran out and he finished making it with Grey Goose. He then scooped ice up with the glass, that is literally the first thing you learn not to do bartending.  The bar was not even busy, so use that excuse all you want, but it is never excusable.   Be prepared when you visit the establishment and maybe leave a low review, you will probably (like I did) get a message from an employee harassing you. Very professional.   Maybe I have too high of expectations, but I have no interest in ever coming back.",

I was in a party of 10, and we sat outside. Torriona was our server, and she was absolutely fantastic!!! She took such great care of all of us. When 10 people order different drinks, different meals, and ask for separate checks, it can be a server's nightmare and be very easy to mess up... but not for Torri! She really hooked us up! Not ONE of the 10 members of our party had a complaint. Between all of us, we had burgers, tacos, and lots of different appetizers. I tried a little bit of everything, and every single thing was delicious. Omg the bruschetta was by far the best thing I ate. Torri even brought us extra bread to use so we could eat every last drop of it lol. I would highly suggest everyone in Pittsburgh eat at Bar Louie. They get a 10/10 for sure.",

We had the chicken lettuce wraps and a few beers, which adds up since it was the 'pregame menu'. The wraps were decent, but were a little too salty for our liking and the beers were on \"happy hour special\", but were still pretty expensive for miller lite.

When we arrived, the brunette bartender with glasses was extremely rude and unfriendly. She told us that she already did last call at 1:40. My friend offered to pay double and she still refused to serve us but proceeded to serve other bar patrons. The men drinking beside us saw what happened and tried to order us a drink from their blonde bartender. The brunette bartender with glasses came back and yelled at us for yelling at the blonde bartender when we never even spoke to her!!!! She then proceeded to tell us that other bar patrons had been waiting over an hour and a half for a drink. Really?! Does your service suck that much?!? After the way my friends and I were treated, we will not be back. I would give this establishment 0 stars if I could.   I would fire your brown haired bartender with glasses or you'll be getting a lot more reviews like this one.",

He was very friendly and didn't mind taking the time to explain the dishes on the menu, what he thought was best (including the drinks). He was very attentive and made sure our drinks were filled.  We started with an app of the tempura shrimp. The shrimp were fried and served with three different sauces of all tasteing pallets. The entree i had, was a surprise chosen by AJ, the Blackened salmon sliders. There were three sliders served with thick cuts of salmon and a side of fries. The sliders had a pesto mayo on them that added to the great flavor.  The atmosphere is friendly. The time we came, on a Saturday around 5pm, was not busy and allowed the service to be extra! The prices of drinks is a little much, but the service and food out way that. Thank you for a awesome girls night! Means a lot!",

    "text": "I have been to this location two times now and I'm so disappointed. I use to love bar Louie and thought they where such a great place to eat. I use to go to the one in station square all the time before it closed down. But anymore I'm just so disappointed with the service and the quality of food. You would think being open in the north shore by some big name food places even stage ae, pnc park, Heinz field. You would think they would strive for quality and sadly I think that's last. I wanted to come one more time before I wrote a review being I thought it was a bad night but I was wrong. The first time the food was slow and way to over cooked. Each time I been here it's been after 7pm and no ones here. They even seem over staffed in front of the house but I guess that's different for the kitchen. I wanted to give the wings a try one last time and once again disappointed. Way to over cooked Once again I just don't understand. I'm assuming it's the wings them self coming in large batches messed up and there just not picked out and made over cooked. Next thing I wanna point out is what happened to $1 burger night? The waterfront location has it listed on there site that they still do it. The waiter had mentioned that all burgers where now $5 bucks and included fries. So I decided to try the (spiked bulleit bourbon burger) and what a let down. The burger was over cooked from me asking for it medium rare. The bun did not seem fresh, the overall taste of the burger was good but it could have been so much better. A big note to mention is I guess with the burger being $5 bucks they skip on the fries cause I had almost none on my plate. When the bill came my burger said it was $6 and my guest was $5. Both burgers being short on fries and just overly disappointed. I really hope things change because I use to love bar Louie but any more I'm not sure if I'll be returning sadly.",

My friends & I went for dinner on a 75 degree day & wanted to sit somewhere outside. We had a group of 10 & tried to go to southern tier next door, however, the wait was an hour and a half. Bar Louie was able to seat us all outside immediately. Our server was awesome, everyone's meals and checks were correct, and we were all so happy with the food and service we received. It's hard to wait on a group on 10 people and have everyone leave happy campers.  As an appetizer, we had a few orders of the bruschetta and it was DELICIOUS. I highly recommend it. My husband got the street tacos, which were great. They come out on a hot plate similar to fajitas & you build them yourselves. I had the salmon sliders & loved them. The salmon was cooked perfectly. I would have never thought to order the salmon sliders, but our waitress recommended them and they did not disappoint. Whoever thought of putting salmon on a mini bun is a genius. Others at our table ordered burgers, flatbread & a few other items. Everyone would not stop talking about how great their meals were. I'd also like to add that the prices are incredibly affordable.  To wrap things up, if you are in the north shore looking for a great meal, awesome service, and an overall pleasant experience, check it Bar Louie!",

It was a Wednesday night around 9 PM, and there were probably 4 other parties in the whole place. We seated ourselves and about 1 minuet later our waiter came over & asked for our drinks. He brought our waters and there was lipstick on my glass. After telling him, he promptly brought another glass. We ordered our food and waited maybe 15 minutes for the food to arrive.  I ordered the Shrimp Margherita flatbread and my boyfriend got the buffalo wings. The flatbread was great! Just enough tomatoes, oil, and dressing. The only thing I would suggest would be to add more shrimp.  His wings were very VERY crispy. Like no meat, all crisp. I'm one who typically prefers crispier wings but these were way too overdone. They had a good amount of buffalo sauce on them though. If we were actually paying for these wings, we would've sent them back. But since they were free, we decided to stay quiet.",

He had excellent suggestions for us and he came to check on us plenty of times   I wasn't super hungry so I got the pretzels and they were so yummy with a cinnamon butter ! My boyfriend got a burger with fries with an egg on the burger . My friend had a salad and tacos I believe.   Overall great experience with good prices for the items we ordered.

    "text": "Whenever I think of Bar Louie, I mentally shrug. That's because whenever I visit one of their locations, I usually find overpriced food (compared to what you can find elsewhere) and a so-so atmosphere. Such was the case with this Bar Louie.   I came here a few months ago to celebrate a friend's birthday. I'll say it now: our party was quite large and did take a while to arrive. So while sometimes I went a while without being checked on by the staff, I'm willing to let it slide. It was Friday; we were a big group; we were a big group that didn't arrive at once. That's a lot to keep track of. And by the end of my visit, it was getting so loud I could no longer hear myself thinking - so I can only imagine what it's like working through that din all evening!  I personally ordered the BLT wedge (with salmon added) and a cocktail, and shared the nachos as an appetizer with the table. The salad was decent - the nacho chips, however, were stale and bland. And honestly, that's all I can really say, because in addition to being relatively expensive, Bar Louie's food is pretty average at best. I never find the ingredients or flavors particularly memorable. My main dish was exactly what I expected; the stale nachos were sadly disappointing.  My visit overall was pretty much what I expected. I knew I was coming here to enjoy time with friends more than the place itself. So Bar Louie served its purpose. I admittedly I will not run back to visit soon.",

I enjoy the darker lighting and relaxing atmosphere, it makes it a great place for happy hour in my opinion. The quieter calm atmosphere makes it easier to have a conversation with your friends/coworkers because you don't have to try to talk over loud music.",

I was with a party of 10 and we wanted to sit outside so they sat us right away. They were very accommodating to our large party. Our server was amazing! She had great suggestions and everything came out perfect! Everyone loved their food and kept saying how delicious it was. You must get the bruschetta...one of the best bruschetta's I've ever had and I love the presentation. Also, the burger sliders were really good and a decent size, very filling. All the food is reasonably priced. Everyone in our party left satisfied. Great food, great service, great experience!",

Ordered fish \"tacos\" and got chemical flavored fish with soggy lettuce, canned black beans, and bland rice. Oh and let's not forget the oxidized (black) avocado slice on top of my disgusting fish. 10/10 would not recommend. Pathetic.  Also, to top off the pathetic food, the food was freezing. AND, this is a huge no-no for me, we received the salads 25 minutes after ordering and then got our entrees about 2 minutes later. Didn't eat my salad, which by the way was soggy with tomato juice. Just a bad experience. Bill was $73 and the horrible waiter got $4. And I thought that was generous. And also, we were one table out of maybe 4. Service should not be bad especially when this incompetent waiter had 3 tables. Save your money and eat somewhere else. I regretted not eating in PNC Park.  Sorry for being blunt.",

There was literally nobody there, a far cry from the scene at Burgatory, which is always packed to the max (so much so that it's annoying). I got a burger which was fantastic. I believe it was called the southwest burger, because it had jalepenos, guacamole, and onions. The tots that I got with it weren't bad either. The only reason I give it 4 stars is because the waitress had literally no clue about any of the beers I had asked about. I understand that its a newer restaurant, but I feel like the staff should have some idea what alcohol they're serving. She was nice and we joked about it, but I do feel like they should still know about all the beers they have on tap. My girlfriend got a martini, which she seemed to enjoy. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to wait an hour to be seated next door.",

It was pretty cold out for a Pirates game, so there wasn't as many people hanging outside as there will be in the near future. The inside looked beautiful. Art work was great, the tables were very intimate. The staff seemed to have their stuff together. All the bartenders seemed to be in a good mood. The outside was very inviting with a little fire pit and some low chairs and tables surrounding it. I noticed 2 garage doors that will open when the weather is nicer for easier in and out access to their outside. This is by far the nicest outside area of any place on the North Shore. Their tater tots are always great, so you can't go wrong with those. loaded or not. They have what seemed to have about 45 beers on draft, a large range of wines, craft cocktails, and awesome looking Martinis. I noticed some pretty good happy hour specials as well. This is probably going to be my new go-to spot on the north shore for the summer. 2 Thumbs up for me. I had a great time.",

I thought we were being punked.  He asked for the special anyways. She comes back with the beer 15 minutes later and he asked if she knew what it was.  She said she didn't know. He asked her to ask the bartender and she finally told him.   The poor guy also got his meal and it was the wrong burger.  So.. by the time we were done eating she came out with the correct meal.  He said thanks, she goes \"no problem\".  Not even an apology.   Mind you, there is NOONE inside of this place.  I couldn't believe it.   I'll stick with the Bar Louie in Station Square.

I would definitely consider hiring a new cook or kitchen manager. Ordered chicken tacos that took over 30 minutes to come out and it came out cold. The chicken was like ground up chicken, brown avocados and the black beans were like they came out of a can. Not impressed by the food but would still visit for drinks, appetizers not bad.",

We waited for 20 minutes after being seated at a table outside and not a single employee came to ask us if we need to drinks or take our order or anything. I have a video recording the entire event, showing multiple servers walking right past us, we were ignored for 20 minutes if not longer. We eventually walked out due to the complete and total lack of service and recognition. As we were walking out the door I noticed somebody setting the chairs back in their place. So it took her less than 60 seconds to put the chairs back in place but we waited over 20 minutes and not a single human being even served us?   Completely unacceptable, this is a horrible establishment. I will never return to this location, or any other Bar Louie establishment. Not to mention I work at a nearby hotel and I will no longer send my guests this way. So incredibly disappointing.",

First off they don't have a host and the place is packed. We found a manager and asked about seating and he barely even looked at me and said if it's empty we can sit there. Really? We waited 20 minutes before anyone even greeted us, once greeted we never got a drink order and had to go to the bar ourselves. It wasn't until we waited 45 mins and found a different manager was when we got our order in. Multiple tables around us left and others were waited on after arriving after us.

This cab was 13.49 a glass.....after getting bill noticed the price and looked through menu and saw at least 2 other cabs that were 8.00 to 9.00.

After two more experiences once during a Happy Hour and one after work with colleagues, I can easily say I will not re-visit anytime soon. Reasons? Service.  It's unfortunate that this establishment has been leveled by its abysmal service. The first time my colleagues and I were trying to enjoy a simple happy hour and were constantly bothered by the waiter making the same joke over and over and insistently being part of conversation. I'm fine with that, but context clues my man; When people are having a private conversation they often aren't inviting of the waiter.  The second time was unprofessional, insulting and down right rude. A colleague of mine waited 15min without getting asked a single question at a high top table. This was before 6 more of my colleagues and I joined her another 15 min (no exaggeration) and not so much as a \"one min, I'm sorry.\" Nothing. We were able to wave down a waiter and let him know we were waiting for 30 min, when he rudely replied, \"Yea, it's kinda busy, you're gunna have to be patient.\" So we got up and left and let the seating hostess know that we were leaving and she seemed unconcerned as well. Behavior like that is just bad for business. I'm not picky, I don't think high of myself. I'm a friendly guy and a friendly tipper. But when you are with your colleagues from a business that is a partner of the establishment you expect at VERY LEAST to be acknowledged within half an hour of being in the establishment.   Don't waste your time. The staff will just put a bad taste in your mouth. Even if the food is good. Damn shame.",

Never asked if I wanted anything to eat...  So I decided on the Thai flat bread and lettuce wraps to go for my son . My flatbread came out looked pretty good. It was salty as all hell.

We ordered our drinks and the bartender walked them over to us - not our own waitress. We waited 15 minutes for her to show up to order our food but finally gave up we had someone else go find her and we pay for our overly expensive $10 cocktails and left to Burgatory which had way cheaper drinks and better food.

All the servers seems lost bringing food out to the tables. None of them knew which table ordered what food, so they wandered aimlessly and asked each table if they ordered the items they brought out. The food itself wasn't very good either. The spinach and artichoke dip was probably the worst I've ever had. It looked as if it was sitting out for hours. It was about 90% cheese and had the consistency of one of those blocks of Velveeta cheese. The chips were not very fresh either. The California Chicken Club sandwich was OK, but the bacon was way undercooked and the bread was greasy. The tator tots could have benefited from some seasoning. I guess my expectations were a little high. I would come here to drink, but not to eat.",

On our last visit after a parties game we swung missed in the service department. Our waitress disappeared for over 15 minutes no where to be seen while we waited for our check.  Also when our food was being served it all came out at different times. The person in our party who ordered a salad was served over 20 minutes after all of us.  The waitress was apologetic and offered him his salad for free which we all did appreciate. We all enjoyed are drinks and they have a nice list of appetizers, while the food is less than stellar.  The flatbreads are mediocre and looked unappetizing. I ordered a burger with a salad as my side. The burger was pretty tasty but hard to mess up.  It came with blue cheese and bbq sauce with all the fixings.  I ordered the salad as my side instead of fries but they somehow also served me tots which was fine.
