Unfortunately that day they did not have fresh pineapples to serve but the fried rice was delicious. Very authentic. They even had Prik Nuu which is a hot pepper mix that I learned about in Thailand and hardly find it here in the US. Unfortunately I live too far from Pittsburgh but I'm for sure going back here when I'm in town again. And thanks for the great service. The donut dessert was delicious.",

Their food is fresh, fast and really delicious. It stands up pretty well to Nicky's Thai (hence the delivery critique - we will almost always default to delivery, so if their driver isn't working then we just hang up and call Nicky's). Portions are large, and their curries are amazing. My husband loves the fried duck curry and I'm a big fan of the shrimp/scallop curry. Try the appetizer sampler as well!",

    "text": "Wow-I must say, what an improvement over what used to be in this spot, Thai Suan Thip! I have lived just down the street from this place for nearly three years, and I had such a bad experience at its predecessor I never had the desire to return even though I had heard it changed ownership. Well last night my date, who spent all day on the road driving back from DC, arrived at my place famished, so he (yes, he's learned well from me haha) quickly did a Yelp search of what was still open nearby, and although I was hesitant, I had been wanting to try Thai Tamarind since I drive by it so often , so we set off on the long drive (approx. 3 minutes give or take) there, and promptly found parking right out front. There were already a few other tables in there so my first thought was \"well, at least it's not completely empty-maybe that's a good sign\", but as we approached the door, I noticed the posted hours differed from both Yelp and the Thai Tamarind website, which was a bit confusing. The posted hours on the door said until 9:30pm, yelp listed 10:00pm, and their own website listed 10:30 pm! So, just a suggestion to Thai Tamarind, you should probably make sure all times are uniform across all the various postings. Even though we came in at 9:00, we were greeted very quickly with waters and menus. The menu is pretty extensive but still typical for a Thai restaurant. After scanning the menu, my date decided on pad Thai with chicken at a 6 level (scale 1-10) and I went with the Wild Curry with chicken (which had bamboo shoots, green beans, baby corn, carrots, celery, and mushrooms) at a 5 level. By the time we ordered we were the only diners in the restaurant, so our food came out very quickly. My curry was pretty good-flavorful without being overly spicy but just enough kick to it for me. My date seemed to enjoy his pad Thai (although he did say he just had Thai in DC that was really good so maybe this wasn't as good?)  as well since he finished the whole plate but at the same time he said it was all he had to eat that day and it was 9:00pm. I took a forkful though and I thought it was pretty good-better than Thai Place but not as good as Nicky's. I liked how it wasn't as dry as some of the Pad Thai entrees I have had elsewhere. Even though we came in near closing, we were never rushed and our server said more than once to take our time. It is BYOB but he still had another 2 hours to drive back home so maybe next time! I did notice corkage is pretty minimal which is nice. They also seem to do a nice takeout business since as we were eating 4 different people came in to pick up to go orders and we were in there for probably about 45 minutes total. I will be back, particularly since this is (currently) right down the street from me and it is a nice walk in the summertime-possibly bringing a bottle of wine with me next time!",

It's the worst Tom Kha I have ever tried. It is watery, doesn't have the right mix of vegetables. The pad thai, is unappetizing, the color is off, the veggies are off. Like, I just don't understand this thai food presentation and why each thing i have ordered is weird tasting or low quality. I lived in thai town in los angeles and I i cant even count how many thai food places i have tried on the west coast, east coast, nyc, in europe, japan, etc. Thai is maybe my favorite type of food and they fall so low on the totem pole in terms of quality. It's also overpriced for what you are getting and the portions are on the small side. I've tried thai here 2-3 times and it's consistently not so good. I've eaten here when it was the last owner, and it was okay, and the owner before that might of had the best quality, but this was at least 6 -7 years ago. I think people order from here out of desperation for thai or they are not too familiar with Thai food, so they are fooled into thinking it's good. After the last time, i said, nope, never again. That's like $45 i am never getting back. Skip the pad see eew too, i have no idea what sauce they are using but it tastes iike nothing i have ever had on noodles. the colors are all off too. They almost taste the same and way too orange in color. Drive to bloomfield or fork over some more cash to have better thai in the northside, but at least you'll say yum.",

Mind you, we went to the restaurant pretty hungry, but it is a shame that after such a fine meal we felt a need to go buy some more food  to satisfy our appetites -- and we are both small portion eaters.",

I like it better than Nicky's Thai kitchen, personally.  We have gone several times, BUT for two people it is $50.  Lunch is a much better deal -- the usual \"get a spring roll and salad with meal\" deal that most Thai restaurants have.",

I dont want to get all dress up. A group of eight friends from the Shadyside area took the short drive chatting along the way and went last night. Tucked around the bend on Lincoln Ave in Bellevue is the cute and quaint TT.  Wonderful decor, soft lighting, real candles with fresh flowers and linen on each table.  Waitress Dear ( so if I write you a letter it would be DEAR DEAR) explained the specials and made recommendations. Prompt, relaxed service. The various Appetizers and main courses everyone ordered were superbly prepared and presented. Price is Right, too. A REAL TREAT!",

Yes.    I think the ambiance is great- perfect for a date.  The servers were nice, but I do admit feeling quite rushed.  The food was good- but not the same quality that I'm used to.  I don't think it was bad at all, I just felt like some of the flavors were missing.  I ordered the same things I often get at other places to offer a True comparison even, so I do feel like I'm being more than fair in my assessment.   It is BYOB which is nice, and I'm sure this location is great for people who don't want to cruise on down toward the city to go to other places.  It's just not a place that I desire returning to.  It just didn't have that oomph factor I need to want to come back.",

We got the veggie fresh rolls and crab rangoon for appetizers both of which were delicious, though I felt that the portion for the fresh rolls was rather small - it was basically one fresh roll that was cut into 2 pieces, but the flavors were bright and crisp, and the crab rangoon was creamy with the perfect amount of saltiness.    For entrees we decided to share the chicken noodle bowl and the Massaman curry with beef.  The chicken noodle bowl was hands down amazing!  It was a large portion with long, perfectly cooked rice noodles with generous amounts of tender chicken.  That alone was actually enough to satisfy my appetite after the appetizers, so I only had a small taste of the curry, which was rich and flavorful with perfectly balanced spices but the beef was just a tad tough.  Overall, this was a vast improvement over the take out that I got on my previous visit, so I wanted to be sure to bump up my review and give them a fair assessment after my most recent visit.  I will definitely be back/get take out from here in the future.",

The decor and atmosphere are exactly what I love and our service was quick and super friendly. I feel like this would be a really great date spot.  The only thing that bothered me is the temperature. It was very cold inside and both my friend and I left our coats on most of the time, which made eating a little uncomfortable.  I ordered the Tom Yum Soup at a spicy 1 with vegetables. It was fantastic. I also ordered the Rad Nah at a spicy 2, with vegetables and tofu. The meal had an amazing and delicious flavor, but this felt more like a spicy 6/7 and caused my nose to run the whole time and mouth to stop tasting the wonderful flavor of the dish. However, that didn't stop me from eating more than I should.  I would have loved to try a dessert, but I was just too full.  The portions were quite sufficient in my opinion, and I was lucky enough to take leftovers home.   I absolutely will be back and I also look forward to visiting when the weather warms and we can dine outside. I really hope this restaurant does well.",

The lady who brought us stuff tried to upswell us on appetizers, and seemed strangely stiff when refilling our waters. Taking away our little appetizer plates when we didn't order any like she was grumpy about it.   The atmosphere is interesting.  On the window, there is a decal that says \"voted cool space 2007\". There are plants inside and outside. There is indoor and outdoor seating, but we chose inside because it was very air conditioned. There are xmas color / themed decorations up in July.   The Thai iced tea is actually very good and strong here!  I recommend it. Usually other places make it too sweet. The pork pad see ew and chicken pad Thai are my favorite dishes and this place does them very well. Their spiciness ratings are 1-5. I got mine at a 2, but I wish I had done 3. Still, it had a nice hint of heat in there.  This is not the best Thai place in Pittsburgh, but it's good enough!  Go here if you want a quiet place to talk, a casual romantic date, or don't mind the higher dinner prices.",

It's tempura tilapia with a mixture of veggies and rice in a sweet and slightly spicy sauce. The fish is nice and crispy and the sauce is delicious!  Service has been great and the food comes out quick. My only complaint is the lighting is really weird. (Which is why the photos are a little off.) Not sure if they are using fluorescent bulbs but the lighting messes with my eyes and gives me a slight headache.  But regardless the food is really good so I'll continue to eat there.",

Arriving around 6 PM and parking on the street up the road, the restaurant it wasn't too crowded inside and we sat ourselves at a table near the front. Even though the whole front were glass windows it was still fairly warm inside.  As the night continued on, a steady stream of people came in for both a sit down dinner and take out.  My wife and I both ordered tea. She had the lemon ginger and I had the Jasmine. We each were given our own personal pot with sugar and a cup. I was very happy with my tea having never tried Jasmine before! For dinner, I ended up ordering the hot basil fried rice with chicken with a spice level of 4 out of 5. The portion sizes are HUGE, but the spiciness was not up to par. Regardless the food was good and the waitress did a wonderful job keeping up with all the tables despite being the only wait staff there.   I really like the portion sizes and the menu itself has a plethora of items I would love to try. Being BYOB is a plus, I just wish this place was closer to where we lived. Nicky's is my favorite Thai food in Pittsburgh, but this place is in the same ballpark for both quality and price!",

A spring roll and a small salad along with a slightly smaller portion of the main entree at a very appealing price.

We were happy to find this local spot and very happy to have hot, reasonably priced food just a couple streets away.  The food wasn't great, but it wasn't bad either -- totally adequate for what we needed in that moment. The Pad Thai definitely had a \"stinky feet\" odor (someone else commented on that as well) but it tasted fine.

With quick, and amazing service, a good menu selection, and beautiful ambiance, we were very impressed by our meal here.  We placed a to-go order of Thai fried rice, chicken teriyaki, shrimp and scallops, and egg rolls. The food was prepared and ready by the time we drove over to the restaurant. And it was all beyond tasty.  What really stood out about this restaurant was two things. One, is the uniqueness of its location and size. It's very small, probably maxing capacity at about 30 or so, and located directly in a neighborhood (man am I envious of the neighbors next door), so you may drive by and miss it like we did if you're not careful. With such a small space they are still able to pack a punch in terms of service, costs, and taste. Second, is the order of springs rolls that we found in our to-go bag when we got home, with the words \"on the house,\" scribbled on top of the carton. It truly is the little acts of kindness and good service that go a long way for small businesses as such. I can not recommend this place to Thai lovers enough, come eat and support them!",

Maybe some additional lime juice, coconut milk, or a touch of pepper, something. I'd eat here again but I wanted a little more out of our food flavor experience. The portions were generous and they had our food ready to pick up quickly. Overall I'm happy with the experience but I think they could step their game up just a bit.",

It's made with cashews (some places make it with peanuts) and the sauce is a subtly sweet spicy sauce that's loaded with flavor. I was super full but could not stop eating it.   Shared multiple appetizers with the table on this visit. The edamame was a bit over done and needed more salt. The mussels were not a huge portion like you get in some restaurants but the flavor of the sauce was very good (and had quite a kick at a 2-level spice). The butterfly shrimp were fried nicely with a good dipping sauce. And the pork dumplings were also very good.   Staff has always been kind and accommodating. Definitely a favorite spot!",

    "text": "Thai food may very well be my favorite cuisine, but this place stands alone in my opinion. I've gone here approximately a dozen times and the food has always been exceptional. It's very small and easy to miss, but it has a warm and intimate feel to it that adds to the entire meal for me. They don't serve alcohol, but they gladly welcome you bringing in your own wine or beer. I also feel that while this is a Thai restaurant, it feels to me that they have a strong Indian fluency as curries are used in many items. This is particularly noticeable in their crab rangoons. The filling is a rich and smooth cream cheese that has a yellowish tint due to the curry. Their pineapple rice has a nice bite to it and it includes cashews, raisins, and nicely cooked onions. I also feel that most restaurants in general tend to struggle with seafood. This is one of the few places that does an excellent job of cooking their scallops and shrimp very well. If you're looking for a cozy and tasty place to get some quality Thai food, I'd highly recommend this spot.",

    "text": "Talk about a random location for a thai restaurant. A group of us decided to take an adventure and drive a little bit out of the way to check this thai restaurant out. It's a great place of the beaten path to have a little date night or relax with friends. The decor is really interesting.   Food: I ordered the tamarind pad thai with chicken which was solid. I like the glass type noodles which was the main difference from their normal pad thai. My friends ordered the red curry, the pad thai and the salmon platter. Everyone was super happy with their dishes. My friend who is very particular about his red curry, said this ranks in his top three. (So win for Thai Tamarind)  Appetizer: Their crab ragoon is more of an indian curry type flavor with the crab, which wasn't my personal preference but the rest of my table loved them.   Presentation: Your rice is in the shape of a heart. Adorbs.   BYOB: win!",

Portions are generous; you definitely won't leave hungry.   Service is usually friendly and helpful. Recommend for sure!",

We ended up coming here after another restaurant had no options that I could eat (only eat seafood and veggies), so when I saw all the positive reviews, this had to be our next stop. And I was not at all disappointed! As a Thai food snob of sorts (it's my favorite cuisine and so I take it seriously), this place exceeded all my expectations! The cute heart shaped rice servings, the to-die-for curry, the delicious tofu (which not all Thai places master quite as well as Tamarind has done) the warm intimate atmosphere-this place has it all! I and my guy can't wait to come back again for another dinner date",

The restaurant is small but quaint and charming.  The tables are more intimate rather than how the dining area used to be setup (I saw some old pictures courtesy of other yelpers).   The dining area is inviting ... makes you want to \"dine in\" with a close friend or a loved one etc.  I ordered chicken pad thai - of course and it was under $10.00!! Great price. It came with side salad and small egg roll.  The chicken was a little dry but the pad thai was fresh and very flavorful.  I like spicy food but not used to their ratings 1-5.. I played it safe and went to 4..  I could of went to 5.    Off street parking. .. not so crowded..   I am looking forward to returning and sampling more of the menu and dining in of course.

We made our way inside and found we were to seat ourselves. A waitress was quick to acknowledge us and take our drink orders. Both of us had a cup of hot tea that came served in a personal tea pot. I have little familiarity with Thai food, however, after reading the descriptions on the menu, I had trouble narrowing down what I wanted to order! I settled on the Thai Fried Rice - egg, broccoli, carrot, peas, and onion. I thoroughly enjoyed the dish and due to the large portion size, was able to take over half of it home for another meal later on in the week.   The prices at this small, quaint restaurant are reasonable for the amount and quality of food you receive. I loved the authentic decor, with orchids lining the window sills. It is a BYOB establishment, so keep that in mind when considering coming here! Our waitress was always ready to refill our water glasses and came to check on us when she was not busy with other guests.Tasty food, caring employees, and unique decor - I recommend giving it a try!",

The restaurant is a small, no frills, seat yourself BYOB. The menu is fairly extensive, and was prepared to our liking.  Of note, the heat level is 1-5. Service was somewhat spotty, as we had to wait awhile to have our orders taken and our appetizers came out at different times. They also do a significant amount of take away business, so it was somewhat distracting as patrons came in to pick up their orders.

The inside of Thai Tamarind is modestly decorated with a bunch of different table sizes/shapes throughout on either side of the restaurant.  For dinner on this evening I decided on the crispy duck, max spiciness, while my wife went with her usual pad Thai.  After only a somewhat short wait our dinners were out on the table.  The crispy duck was described as being in a red curry sauce with tomato, bell pepper, pineapple and lychee.  My duck was as described and plenty crispy on the outside but also fatty at times which duck can often be.  What I didn't care for was whenever a piece ended up in the red curry for over a minute as the once crispy duck became soggy.  As for the curry itself it was certainly flavorful and had a little bit of heat to it, I only wish that it had a little more.  The bottom line for me is that I would come back here again in the future.  I have enjoyed the food at Thai Tamarind each time that I have visited so why not?",

Stopped in for take out one afternoon, to try it out...Ordered Pad Thai with Shrimp and Tom Kha Gai, as I have found them to be good tests of a Thai kitchen's capabilities. The soup was wonderful, not firey, but plenty of flavor, with lots of straw mushrooms, chicken and herbs.  The inclusion of fresh tomato was a nice plus.  The Pad Thai was fantastic...lots of big plump shrimp, good sauce, nice veggies, beautifully arranged even in a take out container....in fact, had they but included a wedge of lime to squeeze over it, it would have been utter perfection.  A definite plus is that both dishes were cooked and ready to go in just 5 minutes!  The dining room is still as lovely as it was in the previous incarnation, but the lower prices and larger servings are a major plus.  The outside seating area is very nice.  I will DEFINITELY be visiting here again, often!  (I just wish they delivered)",

I will order it less spicy next time, as it had me in tears, but it was so good I kept the leftovers to suffer again the following day! The atmosphere is eclectic, dark, and modern. The service is extremely fast and the quality of the ingredients is superior. Surprisingly, there are a couple tables big enough for larger parties of 6 or so, which is awesome! I love living so nearby that I can walk across our street to enjoy the Thai cuisine.

So we popped in last night (a Monday) for dinner. There has been no improvement to the service. It is a small establishment with one server. The problem is the size probably doesn't warrant two but when over half full can't be managed by one. The second most serious issue was the spice or hotness level of the food. We ordered  3, 5 and 6 level dishes, none were edible. I am Asian and like spicy food. I easily order a 6-8 and am happy. We noticed the group next to us had not eaten their dish and it was the same issue, too spicy. The women had actually ordered no spice do to allergies and it was spicy.  If you have a lot of time to sit around you could go and order a 0 or 1 and take your luck with what your going to get. I'm just gonna have to drive down to Nicky's for the excellent Thai they serve.",

The only reason it's 3 stars, is  the green curry is a too sweet, which ruins the palate as you go on to your next curry or noodle entree. They also use canned sweetened pineapple that ruins whatever dish it is in. --- One tip for the uninitiated - order spice level 3-5 to enjoy your food, and never drink cold water, best with pale ale or lager beer to cool your palate between entrees.",

We passed this place after looking at what would become our new home and have been walking the three blocks from our place to Thai Tamarind ever since.",

    "text": "Ordered take out, and got what we expected from the other reviews. While not exquisite, the green curry and duck curry were both very enjoyable! The sliced chicken in the green curry was, well, okay. It seemed to us that some of the veggies, such as the eggplant and bell peppers, were quite fresh; but that others, such as the peas and string beans, were pre-frozen. In sum, Thai Tamarind has the potential to take their game to the next level, but to do so, they need to use ALL fresh ingredients. All of that said, we will almost certainly eat there again. On the personal note, they were friendly, and the inside of the restaurant was quite charming.",

Great flavors and very fresh tasting ingredients. Prices were reasonable, service was good and nice ambiance.  I was surprised it was not more crowded for a Friday night. Definitely recommend!",
