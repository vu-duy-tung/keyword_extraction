    "text": "Last time here we saw some good live music. This time was a Tuesday. We were in town on a Tuesday night and as we soon found out, that meant it was free open mic and stand-up comedy night. We actually had lots of laughs. Cruel laughs. And frankly, I don't know what gives me the right to be such a snark. God knows I'd cry my way off the stage, dead- armed too.   Did I not mention that I think we saw some dude begin to weep after his set? Damn. How are you still smilin, Moose? The things you've seen? He was no worse than anyone else! Do you hear me? No worse than the rest of them! So, the night was part comedy, part tragedy, as so many often are. For real though, for a moment it was like being part of some kind of a heartbreaking documentary of sorts... while laughing with horror?  We never felt so alive.  Anyway, upstairs is cool. The Smiling Moose has really good daily drink specials between 9 &11, the beer list is varied, and our bar tenders were lovely. We had a really good time. Good stuff. Also, since this place has, \"moose,\" in the name, it was a great opportunity to do movie quotes from 1981's Arthur. \"Why don't you forget about the moose for a moment!!!\" Ah man, now you made me miss Dudley Moore.",

    "text": "This review is subjective to a few factors   1. I went here after running half in the Pittsburgh marathon so it was a lazy Sunday evening, it was quiet and dead.   As it turns out this is out how I like bars if I have to be in one while recovering from jelly legs.   2. The service was fast and efficient, because again the bar was dead it wasn't that hard for the girl to keep up with drinks for about 4 patrons. (Though she did have to look at a recipe to make a simple Margarita ... could be disturbing). But my friend said her drink came out alright.   3. Price 4 Vodka sodas made with absolut for 17$ is pretty standard and pretty darn cheap, so that made this place more favorable in my opinion.   5. Minimal kindergartners as I call the young folk in Pittsburgh... too mean? Eh ok to be fair I never adjusted to the herds of young people in the streets of southside at night. But having broken age 30 I feel like the big sister who gets to point and laugh and run from the younger siblings who cannot hold their booze. Again you will note that it was a Sunday and most people did not head to southside for drinks after the marathon but a few did. So if you hit this place on a fri or sat night expect a different crowd.",

    "text": "This is one of the better bars in the Southside. The ownership here have added a personal touch with many of their favorite movies included in the decor and the drink menu.  At their bar, they have 20 draft beer selections (and about 4 IPAs on tap). For their cocktails, their menu has several names based on the movies. We recommend the Phantasm, an invention of the bar's ownership, named after an old horror movie.  The bar is relatively small with a small dining area at the back of the business. In addition, they have an upstairs where they have live music. From talking to the owner, the place was newly renovated in the past two years making it the cozy, nice place it is today to enjoy a drink. There is a large projector screen at the back of the restaurant that can show TV shows and sports.  The service here was courteous and consistent, and added to our enjoyment of our time here. In addition, they have rules in place to keep their business clear of clientele that could tarnish its appeal.  Their bar menu is extremely interesting with one of the best slider selections you can find anywhere. It's unfortunate we already ate and couldn't sample any during this trip. I look forward to revising my review based on sampling their menu.",

    "text": "When I heard that there was good food at the Smiling Moose I have to admit my stomach turned a little.  The Smiling Moose that I knew is kinda dirty.  The Smiling Moose that I knew is smokey.  The Smiling Moose that I knew had loud bands downstairs and staff that were way too cool to be bothered to get you a beer.  The Smiling Moose was the place we'd leave in a huff to go to Dee's.  I'm so happy to report that the Smiling Moose that I knew is gone.   We went to watch the Pens game at the Moose last weekend.  We were the only people sitting at their CLEAN NEAT dining area (seriously).  The game was on a giant screen.  There are less than 10 table total, and all of them were filled by the time the game got underway.  This is a GREAT bar to watch hockey!  So much better than other places I've been on the South Side.   The menu is an assortment of sandwiches, soups, salads and sliders.  We ordered a cup of the soup of the day, a Chickpea Chili with Ostrich.  It was perfectly spiced and very tasty.  The soup came with a big chunk of bread and was a meal in itself.  I also ordered the grilled cheese sandwich, which comes with tomato and bacon.  Several different cheese blended perfectly and gave me my gooey cheese fix.  The bread on this sandwich adds a lot, too - thick but soft.  My husband got the BLT sliders and really loved the Pesto Mayo.    Finally they had Pumpkin White Russians.  They were awesome.    The food at the Moose is quality, so the prices may be a bit more than you'd think.  These aren't $5 footlongs.  Sandwiches are between 7-10 bucks and come with a side. All of my drinks were all 5 each (but I am a beer snob, I'm sure the PBR was cheap).  All in all worth every cent.  We will be back....  a lot.  Especially during hockey season.",

    "text": "I predict I'll have a hard time writing this review without excessive use of superlatives.... but in this case, the Smiling Moose deserves every single one.  The upshot: The food here is top notch. Seriously some of the tastiest food you can find around. The menu points out that the Chef is the winner of the South Side Soup Contest two of the last three years - and first runner-up in the other year. Yes, the soups are incredibly delicious, but so is everything else. Fresh salads and sides, delicious burgers and sandwiches, an incredible line-up of daily specials, excellent sliders, great \"snacks\", and all done with incredible presentation and precision. The portions are good-sized and provide excellent value. The menu is also very vegetarian-friendly, with a ton of options for those folks. Come for the food alone, and you won't be disappointed.  The atmosphere is very casual and the staff is friendly and approachable. As mentioned in some other reviews, the Moose is located in a long-standing punk rock bar, though the musical offerings run a wider range these days. Horror movie posters line the wall. It's a really eclectic feel, but it somehow works perfectly together. For beer drinkers, there's a fantastic draft list of around 25 or so brews - and a nice selection of craft and local offerings.  I met a friend for lunch recently and ordered exclusively from the specials menu. Tempura battered fish tacos of Alaskan haddock and a seasonal zucchini artichoke soup. Both were really delicious. I haven't had fish tacos this good since I was in California, and the soup was lick-the-bowl good. My friend got soup, as well as a sandwich that is basically a grilled cheese and pierogi sandwich, also on the specials menu. I tried his sandwich and vowed to return to order one of my own.  Really, really pleased with the Moose. I bet you will be, too.",

There were fried peppers and oniojs, fresh greens salad, frozen flash cooked mini shrimp and not good aoli on 1 plate - yuck. Then pasttami sliders had a lot of potential but came out soggy from the kraut, thick pastrami (which is usually fantastic, but this was burnt and fatty) and pasta which had a cool twist of sunflower seeds mixed in was bland and AL dente....overall,  a lot of potential but a 2 star rating from us tonight.",

The Moose is a eclectic menagerie of Metal, Punk, Goth, college and I don't care what you think I'm here for the music people!   I have worked with, photographed and know a lot of the bands who have stood on the stage of the Moose. Often they pull in national bands which are typically opened up by a local favorite. I know there is a calendar on line listing various bands and theme nights <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smiling-moose.com%2F&s=ad96271ca1754b9875bea69bb117ecb61b34f60f40e449d081da860181cc2126\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">smiling-moose.com</a>   If this sounds like you kind of place don't take my word for it, stop down and check it out for yourself! Who knows, ya just might have some fun!!!   There is now a huge screen downstairs and the bands now play upstairs. The Moose is one of those places you can go and not get judged no matter what you are into or what you wear.   Over the last couple years Scarfo, the owner, did a lot of remodeling, painting and added a food menu. Now by all accounts The Smiling Moose is a metal bar, but the menu is all non greasy yes healthy food. He has a cook in there that changes the menu on a daily basis so there is always something different to try.",

It is very cheap and there are generous pours. Third is the music, including live shows upstairs in their intimate venue and the karaoke. Oh my goodness, is it fun to do karaoke on a little stage. The crowd is always fantastic, too and everyone is really encouraging. Definitely give this place a shot, meet up friends for a drink or catch a show.

The spin dip was really good.  It was a big pot of melty cheese with just enough spinach and broccoli to make an impact.  We tried a sandwich too which cam with chips.  Wish they had been hand cut fresh chips, but they bag kind were fine.   The place does have a horror movie theme, which is creepy.

    "text": "While I haven't had a chance to partake in the Big Moose's food offerings, I have on a few occasions enjoyed quite a few frothy beverages at this South Side gem.  A jack of all trades, the Smiling Moose serves as a bar, restaurant, music venue, watering hole...  you name it.  They have a massive screen on the first floor, which makes it a fantastic place to watch a Pens game instead of fighting the normal South Side throngs.    The beer selection is great, with quite a few heavy hitters (7%+ abv brews).  Where the Moose really shines is its happy hour...  1/2 off all craft and imports from 5-7 Monday through Friday.  Anytime you can have a Troegs, Rivertowne, Southern Tier, and Moosehead draft for LESS THAN $10 total...  that my friends, is a deal.  I definitely plan on making it here for a show sometime in the future.",

    "text": "I attended a show at The Smiling Moose last night. I never really know with shows and concerts who is responsible for the sound, the rules, basically the all around stuff that makes up the experience of what you are seeing.   For the small space, the venue wasn't bad. It reminded me a lot of Brillobox with it's dark painted walls and upstairs setup. Just wasn't as big and not really as cool since they didn't have a bar upstairs where the show was going on. Seems like a big missed opportunity. There is room for one!   My main beef with The Smiling Moose is the drinking (or lack there of). So you want to let under-agers into the show? I get it. But if we are letting the young ones in and setting up some rules, why wasn't I informed of them before purchasing a strong IPA before the show was about to start!? We went down to the bar. Upon exiting the bouncer said to my friend in a matter-of-fact-you-are-an-idiot tone, \"If you are under 21 you can't re-enter.\" \"Ummm okay, I'm not under 21\", he replied. \"Well then I told you that you needed a wristband.\" Geesh dude, there was a band playing when he came in. Calm down.  We went downstairs (ugh) and got really great beers. The bar tender had to know we were there for a show since we came down the stairs at the same time as other people and the music from upstairs had stopped. So, we buy a beer, take it upstairs and the bouncer says \"You can't have beer in here\" like we should have already known his rules that were posted nowhere. So we had to go downstairs and basically chug our beers to make it up for the end of the first song.   All along a band member from the first set had come down to grab a beer too. The poor (literally) band member made a comment about how he couldn't believe there weren't specials for that band, since they get that a lot. Then he heads upstairs with his beer only to be sent back down to finish it. He had bought a dogfish head with the little money he had and was also forced to drink it fast to see the band he was touring with.  Maybe this place is great to just go in and chill. But the lack of friendliness from the staff and the lame rules for the bar were a huge turnoff. I suggested they play at Brillobox when they come back into town.",

    "text": "The Moose is a very interesting place. Upon arriving don't' let the big scary bouncer dude that scans your idea back you out from entering. I've gone in this place dressed like a total prep to a total metal head/punker and have never had a problem with anybody in there. Lots of horror pictures and scary masks fill the walls and usually there is rock, metal, electro, or industrial playing on the juke box. The people drinking there are friendly and come from all different kinds of scenes around the burgh area. The bar tenders are fast, nice, and courteous, and I have never had a problem waiting a long time for a drink. They have your basic beers on tap and a wide variety of bottles that can keep your taste buds entertained if your are bold enough to try something new. They do have a food menu, but I've yet to try any of their dishes yet.  Make your way upstairs and you can usually find some type of rock/metal/punk band rocking out to a small but hungry crowd.  There is also another bar up stairs and some old school video games that are always entertaining to play and bring back good memories of being a child.   The bathrooms here are a little odd haha. Since I am a guy I can only comment on the guys room and its very small and crammed. Its painted dark green with stickers, and fliers and writing covering the wall. It can be a little intimidating at first but its cool when your pissing, you can read the crazy shit that people have written over the years.  This is a sweet place to drink and every journey I make to the south side I make sure to at least have a beer in here weather the place is crowded or not. I like the atmosphere and the big video board they have which is always playing something cool that goes along with the music blasting, and recently they have been putting the Penguins games on their big screen projector so that's a plus! Definitely go into the Moose. I'll keep going back to it too so maybe ill see yinz there!",

    "text": "Very rarely do I find a place that really blows me away.  For such a small place (with a small menu), I am pleasantly surprised to give The Smiling Moose (TSM) five stars.   Most recently, I went to TSM with boy on a Thursday evening.  The bar was full, so we chose a table in the back.  A very friendly server came over, took our drink orders, and attempted to read us the specials.  I told him there was no need, as they were posted on a chalkboard right next to us.  I can't tell you how much I like this.  Because if you're like me, you have the attention span of a goldfish.  I feel awful making waitstaff repeat their daily offerings.  At TSM, specials are posted in at least two conspicuous places. Huzzah.   I ordered the burger of the day which was served with muenster, grilled onions, and lemon aioli.  Boy chose the grilled strip steak sandwich with roasted tomatoes and horseradish mayo.  Our food was turned around quickly and I enjoyed one of the best burgers I've ever had in Pittsburgh.  It was perfectly cooked (medium), and all of the toppings complimented each other. Moreover, it was a nice \"Goldilocks\" portion.  Smaller than the offerings of Burgatory and Winghart's, TSM's burgers won't ever leave you feeling like a glutton.   Boy really enjoyed his strip steak sandwich.  Both were served on Mancini's bread, which is always a big hit with me.  The one thing I dislike about many would-be great burgers is the soft, tasteless bun.   Both our sandwiches were accompanied by the daily side of potato salad, which was very tasty.   I have absolutely no complaints about The Smiling Moose.  Drinks are reasonably priced, the food is excellent, and servers are friendly. Definitely a must-try in Pittsburgh.",

When you're spending ten bucks on a sandwich and the filler is just eh, it's not worth it. Especially when there are about 300 other places to eat nearby.  Same w salads, snacks, and sliders.

    "text": "I have judged this book by it's cover for far too long. I've always know The Smiling Moose to be \"that metal bar\" that looked sort of dingy from the outside. Turns out they have a fantastic draft selection, about 10-12 micros on tap and another 30 or so in bottles, and an amazing menu all being pumped out by a legit chef (the former chef at Cafe du Jour).   A friend and I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for some lunch and beer during the Steelers game. We arrived around 12:30 and were the only people in the bar. A few more showed up closer to 1 which is when the kitchen opens on Sundays. This is a great place to watch the game as there are 2 flat screens at the bar, then a giant projector screen in the dining area. I tried the buffalo wings and the baked spinach and broccoli dip while my friend had a cup of the roasted red pepper bisque and the cajun wings. The spinach broccoli dip was awesome! It was like if you combined spinach artichoke dip and broccoli cheese soup. It's served up with some toasted french bread for dipping. The portion is very generous, on my own I was only able to eat about a 1/4 of the serving. The wings were so-so, a little too heavy on the black pepper for my taste. My friend said the red pepper bisque was the best soup he has ever had. For 6 wings, the dip, and 2 beers my tab was $23.   On Sundays they have a limited menu, but I did take a look at their full menu and it looks great. They have several inventive sandwiches, sliders, and snack. I think I'm going to come back during happy hour (half off craft beers and $2 off sliders) to try more of the menu. The Smiling Moose is my new favorite bar!",

The downstairs bar has a great happy hr where every drink is half off. Good place to grab a few microbrews half off and grab a few shots with friends after work.

Let me tell you, the shrimp skewers were delish! Eight perfectly grilled shrimp on a bead of lettuce and roasted onions and peppers. If you are a light eater it's a delightful shrimp salad. It's served with cilantro lime mayo to rival my mother's. Please don't tell her.   I also got the garlic sliders, and they were perfect. Usually they are over cooked since they are so small, but these were perfectly medium rare! The pasta salad side was also well flavored. However, I must mention the pasta was overcooked.   I went on a Wednesday night.  This also happened to be karaoke nights with DJ T-money. I flipped through the books and he has quite a selection. He also has 2 mikes and a laptop to sign up with. No needing to shout your requests! I have to say I was surprised that the singers were actually good at singing. There was only one person that was just painful to watch.  That might have had more to do with her underwear hanging out and \"sexy\" moves. She is not the norm!

When it comes to pubs the other one is Pipers.    Us Yelpers really have our act together as we have collectively awarded these folks 4  1/2 stars and they absolutely deserve it.  The beer list is very good and reasonably priced.  They have about 24 drafts and tons of bottles.  I'm most often an IPA guy and I usually have several to choose from.  The food is gastro pub level and boarding on amazing.  The last time I was in my bartender was Keith and he was great.  As I was sipping on an excellent craft IPA he talked me into the daily special.  It was a killer sausage and Chorizo sandwich that was built on Mancini's bread.  It was served with a side of potato salad and was about $8.  As I took my first bite I think I moaned with ecstasy.  It was that good.  On another visit I had a chance to sample both varieties of fritters.  Corn and Black Bean with Roasted Red Pepper Mayo & Polenta with Kalamata Olives and Garlic Marinara.  Either is $7.  Both elicited more moans of delight.  Carson Street has so many places with just average food that it's a True pleasure to have a great brew and a high quality meal at a very reasonable price.",

    "text": "Combining a number of craft beers with half-off Happy Hour, good food, an eclectic mix of patrons and occasional live music makes The Smiling Moose one of the better spots I've visited on the South Side. I stopped by with the intention of eating, drinking and watching the Pens game and somehow found an empty seat at the bar.   That's when I found out I only had 30 minutes left until the end of Happy Hour (5-7pm). Quickly looking over a salivating list of craft brews, I decided to partake in a Rogue Double Chocolate Stout. Of course, I made sure to order another one (remember, 1/2 price!) around 6:58 pm.  The bartender also informed me that all their sliders were half price during Happy Hour as well. One version included BBQ sauce, grilled onions, cheddar and bacon with a side of macaroni salad. I easily submitted an order. Thank you, Mr. Bartender! He eventually took away a completely empty plate as Smiling Ben enjoyed the rest of the game.",

Let me make clear that I will always recommend The Smiling Moose. Great Food, Both a huge variety of both tap and bottled beers. Check the venues out online. I wish my schedule afforded me more days from the Shady Side Area here @  Bakery Living, but days trading, real estate among other ventures forbids me to do so. HAPPY MOOSING EVERYONE)))",

This time, we specifically came here for dinner and to watch the pen's game. We arrived about 30 minutes before game time & found a table by the big screen without a problem. Our server was the bartender, and he did a fantastic job of waiting on us while serving the bar as well. I ordered the grilled cheese with tomatoes and bacon and it came with a side of home made pasta salad. My boyfriend ordered their habanero burger with the pasta salad as well. My grilled cheese was average, but still very good. I wish the bacon was full strips rather than tiny chunks. The pasta salad was pretty delicious. My boyfriend's burger was good- but not as spicy as the description implied. He loved the pasta salad. The large projector screen is pretty cool, especially when watching a game. I also love the horror movie posters all over the bar. Overall, this place is great if you want to escape the typical southside scene, have a good drink and some yummy food.",

    "text": "Let me begin by saying that I've been going to The Smiling Moose for as long as I've lived in the South Side (about 3 years) and I've never have a bad meal. The chef is classically trained and the specials change daily. My tried and True favorite sandwich is the Grilled Chicken, Cream Cheese, Sweet Chili, Red Cabbage, Bacon ($9) that comes with the side of the day. Usually the side is their out of this world macaroni salad. I don't know what their secret is, but it's the best I've ever had. Sweet, savory and slightly spicy.  I could eat this alone!  I'm also a big fan of their Crostini of Rosemary and Basil, Tomato Salsa, Fresh Farmer's Cheese appetizer. This is like a very fresh and delicious bruschetta without the balsamic. There are options for meat lovers and vegetarians alike.  The atmosphere is great if you are a fan of the \"hole in the wall\" type establishment and loud music. There is also a small concert venue upstairs so there can be a crowd during a show. There is a large projection screen in the small dining area and quite a few televisions, so this wouldn't be a bad place to grab a beer and a bite during a game.  Bottom line : make sure to give The Smiling Moose a chance, I bet you won't be disappointed!",

The band was opening for Nick Thomas of Spill Canvas and shows are played upstairs in a small intimate area which really allows a more personal vibe which I really liked. The upstairs also has a small bar located in the back area.  The main bar downstairs although super tight and not much room for moving around (because of the band), was really cool. Covering the entire bar walls were various horror pictures from movies and actors, giving a really cool unexpected theme. If you're a guy, I hope you're not shy as the bathroom was the smallest one I've ever been in, two people barely manage to fit in there. The bartenders were all super slammed but still nice and never rude. Happy Hour was great as drinks were half off. Although we didn't eat, the food looked and smelled amazing.  Pittsburgh has its share of bars and places to go, some of which are not the greatest, so it's always nice to find a random place and it be a fun night out. I'll definitely be back if i'm ever in the area.",

As we walked into this bar where most of on the wall is punk rock bands play we took a spot against the stage. This was an off night from the music, but were we heard that the underrated underdog was the chef who put out so amazing food, so of course I'm going to search out and eat at the place. There were many specials listed on the wall. But what I was surprised by was the menu and its descriptions. We ordered a couple of appetizers. 1st up: Tomato Salsa Crostini - Toasted Sunflower Seeds, Farmers Cheese, and basil topped on grilled crostinis. - this was such amazing dish. All the flavor mixed well and danced  together beautifully.  #2: Spinach and broccoli cheese dip - this was a traditional cheese dip, this left us deflated. Nothing special but I will give you an 8 for originality.  For the mains I ordered the beef burger topped with Munster, red wine caramelized red onion and lemon mayo. - lets just say it was Rockin! The onions made this burger come alive! We also ordered the Grilled Steak with grilled peppers and onions, cheddar cheese and habanero aioli. The onions and peppers left this sandwich lacking, it needed some chippolini onions or the red wine onions. Tasted like a step up from a Philly cheesesteak. At either case. This place is hands down a find in such a large city. Great job Smiling Moose!",

The Cajun Chicken sandwich was okay but nothing to write home (or Yelp) about. The Sliders fall under the same category.  The food wasn't bad but it wasn't memorable or impressive. The beer selection is ok but wouldn't impress a craft beer drinker. Watching the hockey game on the huge screen gained them a star.  Glad we tried it but not in a hurry to come back.",

Anyway...the food is awesome. My favorite is the shrimp po' boy. Comes with some kind of corn salsa that I've never had with a shrimp po' boy before. The sliders are also phenomenal. During happy hour you can get them for $2 off.  They always have great beers on tap, as well as a hug selection of specialty drinks with a horror movie theme. Speaking of horror movies - the place is super cool because there's horror/sci-fi memorabilia all over the walls. There's about 4 signed photos of Sid Haig (Captain Spaulding in House of 1000 Corpses).   I could hang out here every night if I had more money. If you haven't gone...definitely go.",

Their concerts usually start too late for me if they happen at all.   On several occasions over the past 18 months, I'd been angsty over not getting to see bands such as Arsis, Cobalt, Icarus Witch, Valient Thorr, and Melechesh blow minds and bust heads in the microscopic stage space upstairs. Unfortunately, Melechesh never went on (luckily, I skipped that show), and the other acts I mentioned didn't commence creating a racket until 12 or 1 AM!   With my credibility in question, I vowed to take in a gig here, and as per a twist of fate, The Smiling Moose was holding a free (!) Sunday concert that began at 6PM and ended around 9:30.   Hey, I gotta get up in the mornin', y'know?  United By Hate, Victims of Contagion, and Anagnorosis went veni, vidi, vici on less than 100 hessians that evening in a darkened cavern of a room. Ears buzzed, temples ached,  and camaraderie ensued.   So, yes, this seasoned earthdog needs to attend more of these small-scale performances once in a while.   I hear you out there asking about the food.   I was a little disappointed that not all of the menu items SM lists on their website were available on the Sabbath, so I had to settle for a humble, nameless burger with Muenster cheese, caramelized onions, lemon mayonnaise, and lettuce on a Ciabatta bun with a bag of kettle chips. Aside from the burger being cooked medium instead of my requested medium-rare (should I have sent it back?), the sharpness of the ghost-white Muenster (monster? Munster?) clashed superbly with the sugar of the onions, the mayonnaise adding a bit of acerbity, the bun bringing the chew of a sourdough and the crisp bulk of Texas Toast.   Downstairs in the bar/dining area one can experience a celebration of pop culture. Science fiction and horror movie posters and attendant memorabilia decorate the walls as a large-screen television glows upon thee.   \"I'm home,\" I told a chick-chum as she hugged me shortly after strolling through the door. \"You need to come by more often,\" she said, playfully scolding me.   Don't be put off by the music scenes for which SM exists to serve; everyone is welcome here, and everyone was civil during my visit. As my friends and I chowed down, we saw elderly folk as well as rastafarians enjoying themselves. Give The Moose a chance, and you may have fun as well. Or think about it this way: If I, the teetotaler and hater of dives and rowdy watering holes liked it...  Or hell, just munch on some choice bar-food if the punk and the metal makes ya wince.",

If you're not one for the loud trashy vibes the southside usually dishes out, yet you want to have a good time and hear yourself think; the smiling moose is where you should go.   Want to catch the big game and some good grub? (and I mean gooood); the smiling moose is where you should go. Really dig rock and roll, grunge, punk, metal? The smiling moose is where you should go.  Dig live band karaoke or live music? The smiling moose is where you should go.   Yes, this place has punkish and heavy rockish roots and some of those vibes are still around, but shouldn't deter you from going to watch a game or live show, or drink from their somewhat extensive beer list.   Did I mention their food? I've had calamari tacos from their special menu, I've had many of their sandwiches and burgers (hab burger, do it) and a plenty of their snacks (shrimp on a stick, do it) and they are all pleasantly pleasing.   The Smiling Moose is a perfect example of why you shouldn't ever judge a book by it's cover. This is a great food stop, sports bar, rock stop where you can surround yourself with people who don't judge and know how to have a good time without blacking out and listening to feddy wap...The blacking out part still kinda happens.",

Mainly a dive bar, but these little bars are like hidden gems among all the bars and restaurants that gather all the headlines and Yelp reviewers. I love finding these hidden gems that offer great drink specials and amazing for for very little money.

I sprang to my feet to see what was the matter...  Upon glancing, what do my wondering eyes should appear but a darkened abyss and emu's everywhere. I was met with the sounds of heavy metal music blasting upstairs. I glanced around to see if there were any Dante's Inferno signs anywhere....  There were blue haired goths and angry hipsters on all sides. The downstairs seemed kind of clean but yet scary enough to hide....   Away to the exit I flew like a flash, I tore open the door and threw up the sash!  And I heard them exclaim as I fled out of sight.....

We went there to see a show and I was under the impression that this show was going to be a pop show... it was not. The show had music that was Punk pop music which is not my deal. It was also $12 to get in and that was not okay a cover charge for bands that are just local should not be that much. Or maybe it should be I don't know.   You had to go upstairs and it was super crowded. Everyone was pushed to the front and you had no room to breathe or even move. I can't believe that they even jammed that many people into that little room. I feel like I'm a grumpy old woman complaining about the kids these days but it was too hot and too crowded for me to even want to be in there.  I had to leave because I was getting overheated and there was no air and I just hung out downstairs. It was fine downstairs with seating and normal bar atmosphere. If I would have came just for that I think I would have had a better time. Overall, this was not the place for me and that was not the music for me. I think The Smiling Moose is fine as a bar but not as a music spot.",

    "text": "Review is only for the music venue:  This is truly my least favorite venue in all of the city. It blows my mind that they keep getting shows, and that bands actually agree to play here.   First and foremost to my point - the sound here is TERRIBLE. Period. In my opinion, its hands down the worst in all of Pittsburgh. The PA system they use must be half blow or antiquated. Vocals always seem to sound as if through a cone that raises a singer's vocal tone. The sound guy does an absolutely horrendous job of mixing the sound which is normally too loud to the point nothing is actually discernable from one instrument to the other. Bands almost always have an issue trying to hook to the house system, or the house system has issues during show. The sound guy almost always has a hard time giving them what they want in their monitors, which is visually frustrating to most bands I've seen here.  In addition, the venue is upstairs, which naturally makes this place stuffy in winter, and in the summer it nears temperature levels of 'eternal fires of hell'. To add to that, its terribly tiny and narrow and long, which makes it so only the front 2 or 3 rows have any actual visual on the band performing.  In general, the space is pretty awful as well. The bar is overpriced, and chairs are uncomfortable, but that is to be expected I guess. The bathrooms are dim, unclean, smelly, and messy. Walls and ceiling are roughly furnished and tattered. In every sense of the word this place looks like a dive.   Again, it confounds me as to why shows are still regularly booked here. Can booking agencies not find ANY other similarly sized venues better?? Surely they must be out there. I don't know a single person who enjoys watching shows here.",

They have an amazing happy hour! I'm not sure if it changes daily, but on Friday it was half off all drafts & drinks. There was also a happy hour special of $2 off sliders.    For my first drink I went with the Pinheads Punch. I cannot remember exactly what's in it- can't seem to find the cocktail menu online. For my meal, I ordered the sweet bbq sliders which is a burger, bacon, bbq sauce , grilled onion & cheddar. The sliders also came with side of the day, pasta salad (which was delicious) I ordered another drink, the Phantasm. It was honestly hard to pick a favorite because both drinks tasted great & were strong.  Patrick was our server / bartender & he was friendly & entertaining.   2 signature (strong) drinks, 3 sliders & a side for under $14 is a pretty cool happy hour.

    "text": "Have you ever been obsessed with an obscure band and you live your life with an internal struggle between telling everyone to listen to them and keeping them all to yourself because... let's face it- they are TOO GOOD and God forbid if they ever make it to top 40 radio they are going to get played out and you'll be annoyed because now everyone is talking about them and you loved them first? Anyone? No one?   Well anyway, that's why it's taken me so long to review my absolute favorite restaurant/bar in Pittsburgh. I was selfish. Greedy. A low-life. But now I've seen the light and I want to spread The Smiling Moose love to the masses.   Don't be deterred by the Evil Dead posters and Pantera blasting over the jukebox. This isn't your run of the mill metal head bar (although if you're into that, they regularly host metal shows upstairs.)  The Smiling Moose is a legit restaurant with bar food prepared by a classically trained chef. So if you're into unique and delicious soups and sandwiches, this is your place. Soups change regularly. Most sandwiches are bread heavy--served on a baguette, but it's Mancini's bread so it's all good. Some of my favorites dishes include the Chinese 5 spice burgers, black bean sliders, and whatever burger they have on special. The grilled chicken/ sweet chili sandwich and tuna melt are great too! If you visit over the weekend you'll probably be blessed with their pasta salad as the \"side of the day\". I would eat this pasta salad as my last meal on earth. My husband has said that he's going to start bringing me quarts of this pasta salad in lieu of flowers because I get WAY more excited over the pasta than any bouquet.   The Smiling Moose has a great draft list and a huge selection of bottles. The service is always great as well. Out of the 15+ times I've eaten there, there was one time where my order didn't come out with everyone else's. In that instance, our server was so apologetic, immediately amended the situation, and bought me a shot of Fireball.  TLDR: great atmosphere, stellar food, copious drink selection, and attentive  service = a 5 star experience at The Smiling Moose.",

    "text": "I visited the Smiling Moose with the illustrious Chelsea S. on Fri. for happy hour at 6pm.  As Chelsea mentioned, they have a great happy hour--50% off all drinks and $2 off sliders--it's hard to beat that in PGH, let alone the South Side!  Unlike some other bars, happy hour is valid wherever you sit, so we were able to sit at one of the tables, which was nice.  For my first drink, I ordered the Captain Spaulding, a fruity and creamy cocktail that includes vodka, rum, peach schnapps, triple sec, grenadine, pineapple, orange juice, and cream.  For my second, I ordered the Mr. Freeze, another fruity-tropical cocktail consisting of gin, Maui blue, blue cucacao, simple syrup, lemonade, and Sprite.  Both of these drinks were totally refreshing but packed a nice alcoholic punch--I could drink them all day, but it would no doubt get me into a lot of trouble.  Best of all, at happy hour, they were $6.25 together--you just can't beat that!  Because I was hungry and needed something to absorb the booze, I ordered the black bean sliders ($6 HH price), which consisted of a black bean and corn veggie burger with pepper jack cheese, tomato salsa, and citrus sour cream.  The order of sliders came with the side of the day, which was pasta salad with feta.  The sliders and pasta did a good job of stemming my hunger and serving as a booze absorber, but were a bit bland in flavor, esp. considering the ingredients.  I also ordered a cup of cherry-papaya gazpacho ($5), one of the soups of the day.  Although I've never had gazpacho before, it had a complex, satisfying, and refreshing flavor, and was a nice counterpoint to the drinks and sliders.  Overall, I greatly enjoyed happy hour at the Moose.  Our service from our waiter was excellent, and the price (under $20) was right.  I have no complaints about the atmosphere, either, which was smoke free and not overly loud (then again, this may depend on how many other people are there).  I would definitely recommend checking out the Moose if you're looking for a laid-back bar with great drinks and decent food in the South Side--esp. during happy hour!",

Down were the ice skates, down were the random posters everywhere, no more is the pool table, and the upstairs is now a shitty venue.  /sigh  Well the moose used to be great and then they added things like order and second floor band cover charges.  I've maybe seen 2 bands at the moose that didn't make me want to rip my ears off and throw them at the drummer.  Lotsa crappy punk.  Regardless don't discount the moose just because i discredit it.  Its still a rad place for all the tatt'd up heads to hang out at.  Its just not the same.  Regardless they still have slayer on the juke along with down and maiden.  They still have the most insane things on the tv at any given time and the hockey stick banister.  I hope to hell they still have metal mary.  And they still have my memories.    They used to do vinyl metal night, always a good time.",

I had the fish tacos and my husband had the Mac and cheese with eggplant. Both were specials and both were fantastic.

You won't find any frat boys or Jersey Shore wannabes, but a wide variety of \"alternative\" types which makes for excellent people watching - hipsters, goths, punks, metalheads, hippies, you name it!  There is generally some good live music going on, and I love the dive-y vibe - loud, smoky, cheap!  Even though it's normally pretty packed, there always seems to be a seat available and the service is pretty quick.  Plus, no cover!  I really wish there were more places like this in Nashville!",

But I'm writing today for one simple reason: I was at Smiling Moose for a meetup and wanted to grab a sandwich. They had plenty of vegetarian options but nothing vegan. The sandwich I wanted had cheese and an avocado mousse. The waitress was very nice and asked about the mousse for me - it contained butter. I still ordered the sandwich but without cheese or the mousse. Now, I was perfectly content with that and didn't mind that I would probably have a bit of a dry sandwich. However, the chef made me a special vegan pesto!!! It was delicious! And the sandwich was great too! I was so happy and appreciative that they went the extra mile for me! I'll definitely be back on a weeknight when they have the regular menu (it was short because it was Sunday). Friendly staff and yummy food. What else could you ask for!?",

    "text": "The food at The Smiling Moose is one of the best culinary experiences you will ever have.  The Moose is just a bar, like many others on the Southside, but the crowd (in my opinion) is more interesting and eclectic.  You won't find a bunch of frat boys or girls in Uggs there - it's more metal, punk, artists, bikers, musicians, and an occasional suit sprinkled in.  I was a little reluctant to eat there, because I was expecting a bunch of deep fried stuff (think Gooski's - it's really bad...in a really good way, right?).  But when a friend told me that the chef used to work at Cafe Du Jour, I became intrigued.  One word:  Amazing!   Since my first visit last spring, I can't tell enough people about the Habanero Burger.  It's perfection, seriously.  I probably have beef (a burger or steak) 4 times a year and 2 of those times are this burger at the Moose. I went there last night, after a short hiatus (I probably haven't been there for 3 months), and was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a new side for this burger (it's usually a really, delish, light pasta salad) - last night it was a cajun potato salad.  Yes, I said cajun potato salad!!!  And it was everything I dreamed it would be and more.  I've never rated a meal there less than an 8.5, but last night it was a solid 10.  So flavorful, great presentation, excellent service (again, remember, this is a bar w/ food - not a restaurant).......they are doing something EXTRA RIGHT & I am a fan!  Be sure to check out their site before you go (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smiling-moose.com%2Fevents%2Findex.php&s=6081c751f63d197bbc8b652e7c462f179aabddd853f578c04a3775c20cc7a422\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">smiling-moose.com/events...</a>) - chances are, you'll have a fabulous meal and see a really good band, too.

I love this place because everything is reasonably priced, the drinks selection is pretty good, as a concert venue (upstairs), it's small but awesome, and the food is great!   It's a super casual, relaxed bar that you would expect to have your typical run-of-the-mill fried bar food, but ALAS! YOU ARE WRONG! They have some really neat menu items, and everything I've tried there is excellent. My only \"meh\" about The Moose is its size. There is not any standing room really, but if you can get a seat at the bar, then you are golden. Nothing better than dinner/drinks at the bottom bar before going upstairs for a good show.   Quickly becoming my favorite!",

I'm so happy to report back in that the things I absolutely ADORE about the Moose are the same.   Last night the bartenders in the upstairs bar made the night for me. So fun and friendly. Not to mention the fact that without batting an eyelash, they could put up with our unabashedly unruly group of friends.  The beers were a little pricey, but then again all beers seem that way when you're not drinking at home. The shots poured were to the brim as well.   The service was impecable, the staff was fun and friendly, the alcohol was flowing like... well alcohol, and the sound for the show was great. I'm also happy to mention that they are now serving a full menu of food that goes well beyond your usual \"bar fare.\" While I haven't got to try it yet, I'm looking forward to it.",

I have been coming here since it was way more divey and still had holes in the walls (way back before those walls were red, and way back before food was served.) I like everything about this place. I like the upstairs venue for shows. I like the big screen in the back and the random whatever that's on it. I like the drinks named after movies, particularly the Captain Spaulding, and I actually do enjoy the apathy of the staff. I like to drink and be left alone with other heavily tattooed people that like to drink and be left alone. Occasionally, we feel like being social creatures, and when we do, we come to the moose. I have always felt welcome here, and my non-tattooey friends have never felt unwelcome, and that's the most important part. This place gets a rep for only serving a certain kind of people and nothing could be further from the truth. Every bar has it's niche, and some don't seem too welcoming to those who don't fit the profile, that's not the case here. The bartenders aren't going to kiss your @$$, and that's just fine because that's not what I'm looking for. They are going to make you some killer (moderate pun intended) drinks and they are going to laugh at your drunk stupid self. I love this place.  Oh yeah...the food is actually pretty awesome.",
