    "text": "I cannot recommend this place enough!  I'm not really a reviewer, especially when I see that a place is already getting great reviews and doesn't need mine to boost (call me lazy)... but I had to on this occasion.  Went there for dinner this weekend (not my first time there and definitely not my last) and had an amazing dinner and time.  We had reservations, which I would recommend on a busy weekend night, so we were seated right away.  The place has a great atmosphere and a great staff.  It was a beautiful evening, so the windows/doors were open making it an open air seating feel, without actually having to sit outside.  Loved it!  We started with the cheese plate, which had a great selection and variety of cheeses, crackers, jams, fruit, walnuts and honeycomb.  I had the almond chicken, which is easily my favorite meal in all of Pittsburgh.  The risotto is perfect, which isn't always the case at restaurants... sometimes it can be dry and gummy, but this was on point.  My boyfriend had the steak salad.  I never really considered an entree salad to be a meal (salads are always starters for me - or in the case of my Italian family, the end of a meal treat), but he loves it and won't get anything else.  It is quite impressive-looking, to be honest.  The reason I had to write this review is because of the dessert... I had never had dessert there before, but we got the Bananas Foster Napoleon... THIS is why I am writing the review.  They said it's their signature dessert, or something like that, and they hit the jackpot with this one.  I will seriously dream about this and will get it every time I go there now.  I might just have to go for that, if I didn't love the almond chicken so much.  I actually peer pressured the nice women at the table next to mine (sorry ladies for the intrusion) to try it... they thanked me profusely.  So, my taste buds trumped my laziness, which is why I had to write this... I was already a huge fan, but now I'm an obsessed fan... kind of like the teenagers with One Direction or whatever it is (NKOTB in my day).  Thank you Bistro 19 for a great evening and for my new obsession!",

The restaurant is small and cozy with a relaxed atmosphere and nice modern decor. The waitress was nice and attentive. I ordered the French onion soup and the roast duck breast. The soup was pretty good but the duck was fantastic. My girlfriend ordered the short ribs. She enjoyed it and the portion was large. Both dishes were around $20 each. She also ordered the pear martini which was delicious but over priced. All in all everything was great. Probably one of the best restaurants in the south hills.",

Notably, they have a great selection of wines by the glass and they give you a HUGE portion - almost two glasses in one. I had the Malbec, it was very tasty. For food I had the pear and roasted beet salad - very good and my entree was the pumpkin ravioli with spinach. My only complaint would be the spinach had a bit of a bitter finish. Overall, great for a quiet weeknight evening with a friend or two. N.B.  Not the best choice for dining with children.",

    "text": "I know Mt. Lebanon and Bethel Park are fairly upscale, but after a few years in the California of short memories and constant reinvention, I still tend to associate a certain old-fashioned downtown design with a more working-class lifestyle. Brick and slate, side alleys, hemmed in by hillsides--it's like South Bethlehem, East Allentown, or any town in Schuylkill County. South Suburban Pittsburgh is quite sprawl-free, and winding roads snake past closely set houses in old mining and industrial villages. Keep a close eye on street signs, since main roads might not be labeled (it's a major road, shouldn't you recognize it?).  Bistro 19's location might have once been a place that served mainly Iron City beer (Yuengling didn't distribute out west back in the day), but now it has the small plates, local farm products, and extended wine list that you expect at an upscale-casual place. The by-the-glass selection was amazing to see for someone who grew up in the days when PA State Stores sold mainly a few kinds of cheap mass-market wine. Appetizers looked great, and the crab cake delivered in a way you only get east of the Great Lakes. Not formed crab puree, but real crabmeat coated in very light seasoned breading and (my guess) pan fried. The local duck breast was cooked perfectly--with the other layer of fat and skin cooked enough to make it crispy but not chewy or gristly. The green beans on the side were cooked past the limit of doneness, but didn't cross over to Pennsylvania Done (liquified, like most of the foul cooked vegetables I saw as a kid). I may have misread the menu, because I got sweet potatoes inside of regular mashed (not sure if it was a kitchen substitution or if my Squash Avoidance System failed me), but even those nasty things were prepared quite well (not like preparation can hide their evil squashness, though, so I had to quit after one taste). Chambord cheme brulee made up for it with a good creme brulee base enhanced with just a little flavor.  Service at the bar was friendly for a solo traveling diner, and the wine poured quickly and generously. It was nice to get away from the malls and chains near the hotel and find a real downtown with personality.",

We had the calamari were lightly breaded and the dipping sauce is delicious (don't compare it to every overcooked and fatty calamari you've had in any cheap Italian restaurant).  My wife and I both loved our entrees and they were perfectly cooked.  However, dessert was a disappointment.  The only reason I didn't mind too much is that I had already had a cocktail, wine, and a nightcap!  Next time I think we will skip dessert.  Most of their desserts are brought in from a store down the street anyway, so in the future we'll just get a second appetizer!",

I guess we just were lucky, anyhow everything about this place is consistently good. The have a great bar with excellent wines to chose from. I actually kept it simple on this most recent visit and tried the Bay of Fundy Salmon which I was very happy with. It was quite a large size piece of fish topped with a tasty creamy/ Dijon mustard sauce that was not overpowering at all. The fish was cooked perfectly and it flaked apart very nice. Also, had the French Onion Soup which was very good but my personal preference would have the cheese on top cooked a little bit more, I thought it was, as if the cheese was barely melted. Don't get me wrong though very good soup. Then for desert I tried the Caramel Popcorn Sundae which was extremely tasty.  I typically don't order desert but I just had to try this simply because of the name, I love caramel popcorn. I will be certain to save room for desert every time I come here. Service was very professional, timely and accurate. I was happy that we all had a great meal while doing some catching up.",

    "text": "Has it really been almost a month since I've reviewed a restaurant in Pittsburgh?? Well, for shame Neal M. let me remedy this directly and I couldn't have picked a much better spot than Bistro 19 to begin my spring reviews.  I was here for dinner on Tuesday of last week with a couple business associates.  I arrived a little after 7 PM to meet Tom and Mike who were seated at the bar enjoying their first cocktail.  The space itself is quite nice and intimate.  However, they seem to use the space well as to make it seem much larger than it's actual I'd guess 1,000 - 1,500 sq. ft dimension.  You enter and are greated by a large bar typcially packed with locals in casual wear and suits alike,  The interior is sparce and minimalist with high ornate ceilings and tables located throughout but not so close as to lack privacy.  The colors are dark deep browns, gold and green.  The tile columns and exposed wine rack are also a nice touch.  The bathroom is located in the back near the kitchen entrance and are large and well designed.  After a cocktail at the bar we make our way to a table in the back with a nice view of the bustling suburban street on a spring weekday.  The server greets us promptly with a big smile and reviews the features while grabbing us all another cocktail.  I'm having dirty martini rocks which are pretty good, however lacking those really big olives that I likeand most often get at steakhouses.  The meal starts with some bread and butter, meh.. then we order a couple of appetizers.  Mike says he really likes the \"pot stickers\", so we try those and then also try the lemon pepper calamari.  The calamari is fine served very lightly breaded with some type of mayo sauce or remoulade.  The pot stickers are also adequate spiced with some type of thai sauce.  We all decide on salads instead of soups and I try the french onion soup, which was very good.  It had a much more layered flavor than many other french onion soups you get in casual spots and was well seasoned with a somehow still crunchy croute and mounds of gruyare.  Tom and Mike tried the soup of the day which was some type of chicken thai soup that also tasted pretty good from the small sampling I had.  It is so True that you can tell a lot about a chef by their soups and this start led me to believe the rest of the meal wouldn't let us down.  Tom and Mike had the chilean sea bass, which was a nice healthy serving of perfectly cooked sweet sea bass with a nice slaw and marinade.  I had the \"steak and cake\" which was their filet (good quality, not prime) cooked perfectly medium rare along with large perfectly cooked asparagus, mashed potatoes (forgettable) and a good crabcake.  The crabcake had almost no filler and was served with a nice mustard sauce.  This crabcake is good and almost in the same league as Andora's or monterey bay's crabcake,,, almost...  We finished by splitting their version of \"bananas foster\",,, it was very good with a flaky crust and homemade whipped cream I'd guess.  Overall this is a very good option with a warm atmosphere and good prospects in my estimation for long term success in this casual fine dining segment.",

My husband and I went here for \"date night\" and were pleasantly surprised.  We made a reservation, which I hear is a must, and were seated very promptly.  Our waitress seemed like she was just being nice because she felt she had to, but I can't point out anything she did wrong in particular.  She did bring out our entrees while the appetizer plates were still on our table them blame someone else for not picking them up, but this may have been an honest mistake.  The Calamari appetizer was cooked perfectly and that is a rarity these days.  My filet mignon was wonderful and the port reduction was the highlight of the dish in my opinion.  Very flavorful.  My husband had the sea scallops and they were not carmelized as much as he would have liked but were also cooked to the proper doneness.  The sweet potatoe creme brulee and the chocolate peanut butter cheesecake were a letdown.  I would just stop before dessert and it will be a wonderful meal!  I would go again.",

I ordered the black tiger shrimp which were topped/stuffed with this creamy spinach and artichoke mixture.  You get 4 large shrimps and this is more than enough because of the richness of the dish.  There's risotto in the center of the dish which just adds to the richness and comfort of having this entree on a cold evening.    The shrimp were perfectly cooked and while I thought some bites were a bit too cream-cheesy for my taste...I think it's more me than the dish.  The waitress also warned me that this dish is filling as I was debating on whether to get the shrimp or Bay of Fundy Salmon.  She mentioned the salmon is a bit lighter while the shrimp is a heavier dish.  I could only finish 3 of the shrimp and while I'm sure I could have managed to get the last one down I did want to save some room for dessert.  I'm glad the last shrimp didn't make its way in to my mouth because the Bananas Foster Napoleon would have been a crime to miss!  The caramel sauce, vanilla cream, bananas and pastry dough was heavenly.  My only \"complaint\" if you could even call it that, was that I wish that the pastry was a bit more melt-in-your-mouth like butter type of flaky.  Bistro 19 is not to be missed!",

Glad we made dinner reservations as it was pretty busy for a late Wednesday night dinner.  Went with a few friends and after a round of red wine, martini, and pumpkin beers(the drinks are a little pricey) the group started with the special soup of the day, a crab vegetable.  I skipped having a starter and ate some bread with whipped chive butter to hold me over until our entrees came out. Yum and loved the butter. I went with the pork for my entree which was grilled with a chipotle rub and raspberry sauce and melted in your mouth. Also served with grilled squash and mashed potatoes.  My date choose the sword fish which came with clams and sausage.  Our friends got the duck and shrimp and everyone was very happy with their choices. The food came out quickly, was hot and looked beautiful. Next time I will make sure to save room for dessert as they had a lot of great ice cream options!  On a side note in October they have a 5 course pumpkin menu for $40. Looked pretty good.",

    "text": "I've been an avid Yelp user in my current digs in Shadyside for a long time, and I also rely heavily on my fellow Yelpers when I'm traveling. Prior to my current visit back home to my parents in Carnegie (yes, that long arduous trek over the hills and through the Fort Pitt Tunnel), though, I hadn't done much Yelp-sploring in the South Hills area of Pittsburgh. My mom and I were at our usual crossroads in deciding where to have dinner, so I went to Yelp for a little assistance, and came across Bistro 19.   Nestled into a cute stretch of Washington Road bustling with boutiques, cafes, and restaurants, we were pleased to find a small, cozy, dimmed space and a table by the window (which was still very toasty despite the January temps outside!). As other reviewers have commented, one of the highlights of the meal was the bread basket: two different, warm varieties with some delicious whipped honey chive butter for good measure on the side. For our main courses, my mom got the lobster gnocchi, which came loaded with a whole king lobster tail perched on a bed of gnocchi swimming in a rich gouda leek sauce. I was lucky enough to sample a bite (or two), and it was absolutely delicious. My first generation Italian mama gave it her stamp of approval. As for me, I had the Bay of Fundy salmon, which came with sides of Basmati rice and asparagus, the latter of which was deliciously crunchy and fresh despite the time of year. The salmon itself was perfectly cooked with a sweet and savory maple Dijon glaze on top. The kicker, though, was the toasted pecans and goat cheese which sat atop the glaze. Some of my favorite salad accompaniments on top of salmon was definitely different, but absolutely delicious. He portion was generous (yay for leftovers!), so we were able to ration some room for dessert. We got the apple bread pudding (yum) and the popcorn sundae, which was like a grown-up bowl of Cracker Jacks with salted caramel ice cream and real whipped cream.  Overall, Bistro 19 was a delicious find in the South Hills. For the quality meal we had, I thought the prices were very reasonable: with salad/soup, main courses, and desserts (but no drinks), our bill came out to around $80. Hoping to be back soon for a special (or not-so-special) occasion!",

Lame service. Got up and left to go across the street to CC's - five stars, friendly and welcoming.",

    "text": "Got my side business on Etsy started yesterday! Yay! So my husband and I went out to celebrate and decided to give Bistro 19 a try since we has heard so many great things from friends. Gotta say that everything was really good, all our food came out at the right temperature, wait staff was attentive and we didn't feel rushed. Atmosphere was romantic and trendy but remotely quite, which we definitely appreciated after a long stretch with the business. Definitely have to give them 5 stars since it all went so smooth and I truly wish I had had room for dessert.   There was only thing however, I was disappointed in and that was their current summer menu. Many times I find summer menus to be overly saturated with \"fresh\" meals that are overpopulated with vegetables. That is what a salad section is for in my opinion. I wanted  to see more of a variety of meats and styles but a friend told me that their fall and winter menus usually encompasses that more. I love summer but sometimes it is my downfall :). Looking forward to going back though and seeing what they have to offer.",

    "text": "The BF and I had been itching to try Bistro 19, and the $30 Fixed-Price Meal offered during Pittsburgh Restaurant Week was the perfect incentive to join the Real Housewives of Mt. Lebanon for a tasty night out.  Let me start by saying the food was delicious, but I was really blown away by my yummy beverage.  For the life of me, I can't remember what is was called, and Bistro 19 doesn't have their cocktail list on their website (I think b/c it's rotating).  Suffice it to say, it was strong and delicious, a fruity variation of a martini with vodka.  Their wine list is EXTENSIVE, too, so this is def. a place to drink and dine.  I started with the Pan-Seared Scallops for my first course.  There were only two scallops (bummer, b/c I LOVE scallops).  Tender, flavorful, and cooked to perfection. @Curtis G's first course, the braised pork mac & cheese was much more plentiful, and full of baked cheesy goodness.  I had the Roasted Lamb Gnocchi for my main entree - the lamb was seasoned well and def. had that slow-roasted taste.  What the first course lacked in size, the entree made up for; I could barely handle all the lamb/gnocchi goodness!  Dessert was also included as part of the Fixed-Price Meal and was A-OK.  I don't think I can give dessert a fair review, as I was soooo stuffed from my entree and delicious martinis.  So, why 4 stars?  I just can't imagine making a special trip to Mt. Lebo to go back.  I thoroughly enjoyed the food, the prices were reasonable, and we experienced good service.  With so many excellent restaurants in the city, I don't think I'd make the drive back out (yes, I'm a city snob!).  If I'm in that area for some unknown reason, I would for sure go back.  If I lived there, I'd join the Mt. Lebo locals often.",

A serving of the Pan Seared Scallops was our starter, and they were delicious, especially with the bacon marmalade. My entree was the Maple Leaf Farm's Duck Breast which was tender beyond compare. It was complimented by a blueberry port reduction, parmesan risotto, and green beans, all of which was fantastic.   Our dessert that we shared was the scrumptious Banana Foster Napoleon.

However, upon the recommendation of Rachel C., we decided to check out Bistro 19. I'd heard about some serious service issues from another friend and was a bit apprehensive, but everything was perfection. The atmosphere was casual elegance, and I liked it. The menu has a lot of variety, including options for fish people like me, and meat and potatoes people such as Jonathan D. I opted for the scallops and he ordered the duck. Mumsie and her man ordered the salmon salad and short ribs respectively. The house bread is amazing and the meals that followed were equally impressive. Our server was quick and pleasant; and the complimentary birthday dessert she provided was incredible. I wouldn't usually order something like Bananas Foster, but I will now!

As I said the food was excellent, just not enough to satisfy our hunger so I was glad that we ordered desert.  We both got the Triple Threat Chocolate Cake (which they get from Uptown Coffee).  The size of the cake was on the small side for $8 per, but it was so good that we went to Uptown Coffee the next day and got a much larger piece for $5.  In summary, the food is great if you don't mind paying a significant premium for it.  My advice is to order two meals if you want to feel full.",

    "text": "With our 3 year anniversary looming, Kay and I came to Bistro 19 after striking out reservation-wise with several other restaurants. My lack of foresight became destiny for Bistro 19 gave us a scenic, gourmet flight with no turbulence encountered.   Dimly lit with wavy patterns decorating the fang-white walls, we were given a commodious and comfy booth in the back of the dining room (it helps to mention that you'll be celebrating an anniversary when you make your reservation). Since our reservation was for 5pm, an hour after their opening time, we felt almost as if Bistro 19 belonged solely to us as we each cracked open the ornate, metal-backed menus, if only until the dinner crowd began to dribble in concurrently with the mild rain.   A typically tasty Caesar Salad kicked off my end of this special meal. A crunchy plank of foccacia crostini bread came with the anchovies-garnished mound of fresh Romaine, diced tomato, and grated Parmesan, the tart and milky dressing acting as the salad's reason to exist, countering the brine of the small strips of cured, oily fish. If there was a textbook ideal for Caesar Salads, this would have been it in terms taste and presentation.   Pan Seared Sea Scallops were the appetizer of the evening, and like the salad, were made to shine by a tiny, essential component. In this instance, it was the inclusion of a bacon marmalade, the exquisite union of brackishness and sugar topping the juicy, quivering scallops which in turn capped disc-shaped croutons. A sensational smoked tomato vinaigrette that called up Russian or Thousand Island dressed an eclectic pile of mixed greens in the middle of the two pillars.  Having poured through the menu online and at the restaurant, I had trouble deciding what I wanted. All of the items were good, good reads but either contained components I don't care for or were simply dishes I've had too often of late. I finally stopped dallying and arbitrarily chose the Black Tiger Shrimp. Fate, once more, proved that She had the upper hand.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DdfqSPFBU8vw&s=57a308c4d25f57fffaf003985a59d99200fc516e7a6ba906d30872a181490419\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=dfqS...</a>  Packed with artichoke, spinach, cream cheese (?), and a tomato parmesan sauce, the fat, gracefully displayed foursome of savory prawns surrounded a heap of cheesy risotto and more bales of spinach. The sauce was reminiscent of the dressing involved in the starter only that it was obviously served warm. Wolfgang Puck probably wouldn't have approved of the dense risotto (he'd likely thin it out with chicken stock), but it was tasteful enough that I minded very little, lugging the shrimp through it before every bite.   I had planned on indulging in the Caramel Popcorn Sundae after dinner, but considering it was an anniversary we were observing, we were brought a helping of the Banana Foster Napoleon to share, complete with a lone candle sunk into it. Turnovers and baklava are easy comparisons with flaky meeting syrupy halfway. Gobs of scratch whipped cream kept things from being too decadent as tangy blueberries countered the hot starch of the banana chunks. A pastry's pastry sitting in a shallow lake of saccharine goo and filled with a luscious vanilla creme, we were left with no reason to complain and every reason to return (I want...to try...that sundae...). Bonus: We were not charged for the dessert!  Chef Jessica Gibson Bauer is to be thanked for providing us with such a thoughtful, creative, and relishable meal, her apprenticeship at the Carlton (another amazing restaurant) proving invaluable. Gastronomers, may the stars lead thee to Mt. Lebanon. Treat your significant other to a commemorative night at Bistro 19 whenever the date arrives.   P.S. The service provided by Cheryl, our waitress, was peachy.   P.P.S. Don't let Wolfgang have the risotto here...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DmRp2phlJWXA&s=376b47c5001f7824a7ac2f38a12d07cf22bc8f7317d04aba9b5f8eb785f374bf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=mRp2...</a>  Again, its composition didn't really bother me, the non-chef, but I couldn't help but think of the above clip as I partook in the risotto.  P.P.P.S. To think my relationship with Kay began innocently with some pizza 3 years ago...  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/italian-village-pizza-pittsburgh-8#hrid:QuAqwfGv9CRAGOVXJVOTPw/src:self\">yelp.com/biz/italian-vil...</a>",

My friends enjoyed the lemon pepper calamari. I was disappointed that the menu has NO vegetarian entree options..NOT ONE which is a bit uncommon these days. So I decided to order an appetizer for my entree and went for the grilled vegetable stack in balsamic and basil oil. It tasted good but I wish they offered at least one veggie entree option because the food seemed great and my friends really enjoyed their chilean sea bass and steak salad. What made up for my disappointment though was dessert. PLEASE.. OH PLEASE don't miss the sweet potato creme brulee which ended up being phenomenal.

    "text": "This is a little gem on 19 in Mt Lebanon. Not a lot of seating in here, so o recommend making a reservation if you'll be there during dinner rush.   Parking is all on street except for a few small lots nearby.   Went for dinner with a group of 6 around 8pm. Service was quick, but not rushed. Three of us had a glass of wine each, and the other 3 stuck with water.   There was a nice variety of breads brought to the table along with a flavored butter (maybe it was honey? Can't recall). The piece I selected from the basket was tasty.   I had scoped out the menu online prior to going to the restaurant, and their menu appears to change seasonally to some degree. There were more items on the menu in the restaurant than I saw online.   I, along with 2 others at the table, ordered the butternut squash ravioli with cranberry Brie and crispy kale. It was divine. The portion size was perfect - not too much but I was able finish the plate and be full. Also, the cranberries were perfect and didn't overwhelm the dish with tartness.   We didn't test out the dessert menu.   Overall, I highly recommend this place and can't wait to drag the better half here!!",

That comfy could come from the servers and bartender...all so nice and do a great job.  Stopped by on a snowy night when a function we were going to was canceled...needed to find a nice comfy place with good comfy food...B19.    The food is very good and sometimes a little adventurous with some great comfort type items.   We stopped at the bar and since we did not have reservations decided to eat at the bar since the wait would be very long...gee, it is snowing like crazy and not one cancelation.   The bartender is great, friendly and mixes a good drink.  We split the Lamb Empanada with mole sauce, lime cilantro slaw and the Pear and Roasted Beet salad; both were very good.  For the main course, I had the Red Wine Raised Beef Short Ribs that had an apple cider glaze with some delicious whipped potatoes and baby carrots.  The meal was delicious, meat was tender and tasty.    If your looking for a neighborhood bistro with a comfy and trendy feel, B19 is it.",

    "text": "I would not go as far as \"up-scale\", Bistro 19 is one of those establishments with a number in the name, which have yet to be consistently great.  To note, my personal rule for eating out in any city, jokingly, is if it has a number in the name, it generally just plainly sucks or simply thinks too highly of itself.  Bistro 19 is no exception, but it can provide a good experience on the right night and it has the potential to become exceptional, especially if they renamed to simply \"Bistro\".  We traveled back after a few months and discovered the same menu items on a sparse menu.  A big surprise to us for the small menu, kind of a bore considering the lack of cuisine options in the area.  We actually ended up leaving and headed elsewhere and have yet to return, but it's not entirely off our list.  YET.  This was after taking some considerable time off from our second visit.  Why?  The first visit was friendly, the food was decent, although the price was not on par, and most importantly - the servers and management had listened to our request for no oil on a specific order very attentively with excellent service.  The second visit, the same order was received with lavishly garnered oil, visible to the eye and tastebuds.  After requesting the server twice to confirm, they had claimed they had spoken to the chef and that no oil was used.  Apparently the servers and chef (if they did look at it) are blind to the shimmery effect of oil.  In addition the service was meh at best.  Oh well.  We tried.    Although I had gone with ravioli on our first trip and it had hit the spot, I had pursued Bistro 19's burger on the second experience, as a house-made burger is one of the best ways to sample a restaurant's quality.  And the below par experience continued as the burger was poorly structured, turning into an absolute mess mid-way through and offering no special restaurant flavor or experience to warrant the bistro price tag.  Confusing at best.  I simply wanted to finish it and move on, because I was hungry.  Bistro 19's service is ranging between average to good, but overall the environment is a bit tense for the offerings in the category of \"trying too hard\" for what it is.  It is not as relaxed as I wish it would be, and from the three experiences we have had, it is not offering enough, which leaves me yelling \"Give me more Bistro 19!\". You are on the right track!  Just more!  And just go with \"Bistro\", trust me.",

Level of detail was also amazing-- from the high quality cheese in the risotto that came with my chicken, to the fact that the waitress split the servings for my girlfriend and after we mentioned that we were sharing.  Great location, in cute downtown Mt Lebanon, around the corner from a T stop makes it a pleasant trip from downtown.  This is a rock star!!!",

I think the waitress was doing the best she could, but they need more staff.  We ordered sweet potato fries with the burger and they never showed up, couldn't tell the waitress because she did not return to check on us.  We were relaxing, so we were in no rush, but we were in the place for an hour and 45 minutes, a little too long for lunch! I think the \"whipped cream\" on the dessert trio was Cool Whip -- whipping cream is easy, that just seemed strange to me. We have been here a many times with mixed results, I do wish they would have some new items on the menu, espiecially the lunch appetizers.",

She was definitely not the endearing type you'd think you'd encounter at an upscale little bistro.   My husband and I were there for lunch, so we both ordered the French Onion soup, and I got a barbecue cheddar bison burger, and my husband got a turkey sandwich.  If I was basing Bistro 19 on the French Onion Soup alone, I wouldn't hesitate giving it 4 stars. It was delicious!   They brought out for me another burger entirely, and my medium I requested was very medium-well to well done. I'm not the type to ask to have my food returned for being incorrect, so I ate the burger I did not order. It was ok. Too well done for my liking, and the cheddar cheese was sliced too thick and not melted over the burger.",

Bistro 19 is on the small side and the place was packed with the exception of the bar area. Athena appeared right away with a bread plate and to serve water and take our drink orders. I was in a festive mood and more than happy to try a signature drink, the \"Nine-teeni\". The drink was Amaretto, Three Olives Raspberry, cranberry juice with a raspberry sugared rim. Very yummy!   For an appetizer, we shared a jumbo lump crab cake with whole grain mustard aioli and served with a bit of parmesan pine nut salad. B.J. thought it was a bit mushy and it was, but the flavor combination was wonderful. We also ordered a Bistro salad to share, but somehow managed to get the house signature salad, the \"Pear and Roasted Beet salad\". We didn't mind, it was wonderful and included candied walnuts and huge blue cheese crumbles with a nice walnut vinaigrette.   Jim ordered an evening special, scallops with homemade oxtail ravioli, also served with asparagus. Very good. I had the center cut filet mignon, with gorgonzola, wild mushroom compote, port wine demi-glace, whipped potatoes and asparagus. The steak was cooked perfectly and very delicious.  Too much for one girl, so BJ gobbled it right up!   For dessert we shared a dessert special, pearl tapioca with mango chutney. J. thought it was just okay, but I loved it. I have never had pearl tapioca and I really liked the texture, the fact that is wasn't sickeningly sweet and thought the mango was a perfect flavored accent. Also, loved all their choices of coffee drinks. I had the Cafe Joy, which was Malibu, Bailey's and Frangelico. Very good.   The restaurant had a steady stream of customers the entire time we were there. It was a little noisy, but the restaurant has a very warm feeling, sorta romantic, very chic and stylish. When you enter the huge front door, it's like stepping into another world from away from Washington Road.  Executive chef Jessica Gibson does an amazing job and I appreciate her creative specials on the menu.  Service from Athena was excellent. Every dish was served right on time and she was incredibly professional, yet warm and friendly. I love Bistro 19. It's a bit of a road trip from where I live, but worth the trip!",

I was there on a Tuesday night, and every table was accounted for so I took a seat at the bar.  I ordered a pumpkin ale (yum) and the autumn penne.  But unlike the scrumptious description of the penne on the menu, I found myself eating a fairly bland penne alfredo-alike with some supermarket-tasting chicken sausage on top.  I think it's one thing to be a nice place and it's one thing to have pretty descriptions and combinations on your menu, but another for your food to taste as good as it sounds.  And as far as taste went, the food just didn't live up to what I expected.",

She raves about the food and reasonable lunch prices. At 12 on a recent Wednesday, there were about 5 other tables in the restaurant. I looked over the menu and decided to indulge my inner carnivore with a bacon cheese burger which came with a side of tortellini salad. The menu had an array of sandwiches and lunch entrees. Some of your favorites were included (burger, wrap) but were done with a gourmet twist. There were also heavier meals (entrees) like almond chicken with brie, rice and veggies. We were served bread and butter while we waited. Within a few minutes, my well done burger arrived. Although ordering well done could often result in a dry, rubbery slab of beef, this burger was juicy and tender. In fact, it was so tender that the burger fell apart a little as I chomped down big bites. The accompanying tortellini salad was light and refreshing. I also chomped down on my friend's green beans which were cooked to perfection with a hint of garlic. Overall, a great lunch experience at a reasonable cost. If you are looking for an above average lunch with reasonable prices ($9-12) Bistro 19 is a great choice.",

Intimate, modern, romantic, quiet, great service, delicious food and a convenient location. My boo and I usually share an appetizer and an entree which is perfect and they always have vegetarian options. Pittsburgh needs more places like this.",

We have never been disappointed with a meal there. It can get busy any night of the week so I would suggest making a reservation. I love the duck, sea scallops and filet! My husband loves, well, everything, but especially the pork tenderloin. This is a great place to go with family and friends.  Also, a great place as a couple.  Sat at the bar a few times as well and always had great great service!!!.",

For an appetizer we got the grilled vegetable stack which was very well seasoned and not overcooked.  Nice grilled flavor with a little balsamic glaze on top. She got the almond chicken (which she liked very much) and I got the braised short ribs, which was also quite good.  We also split a third entree between us, the tiger shrimp, and this was filled with a spinich and artichoke cheese filling which was really too rich for my tastes, and I only ate about half of the filling.  The spinich it came with was also very salty.  For dessert I got their bananas foster, which was very rich, but strangely, also very salty.  I could understand using a little bit of salt to enhance the flavor, but I only ate about half of it due to the intensely rich, sweet and salty flavors.  Altogether a good atmosphere, good flavors, and good service.",

Friendly, but only came to our table once to refill our glasses. It wasn't horribly busy and as a former waitress I understand there than can be circumstances that pull waitstaff from the front of the house, but two small glasses of water and one glass of wine over appetizers, salads, entrees, and dessert isn't enough. I ordered a Pinot noire to accompany dessert that I never got, but fortunately wasn't charged for. Our salads came out with our appetizer so I didn't have a chance to ask for more water between courses. And I'm positive I was given Chardonnay instead of Cabernet Sauvignon to accompany my entree. This isn't going to keep me away from enjoying a dinner there again but please make sure the waitstaff is more attentive. Thank you.",

The first time was many years ago shortly after they opened. I remember the food being good but for some reason it didn't stick out to me. Well just the other week we decided to eat there again, pretty much the deciding factor was they had outside tables and wanted to eat outside on a nice summer evening. Well this time the food was unforgettable! Every dish we ordered was amazing! We ordered quite a few dishes. Really, it was too much food but there were so many items on the menu that sounded so good I couldn't resist. Besides, there's nothing wrong with having leftovers. :)  They really nailed it on every dish, the appetizers, the entrees and even dessert. Don't leave there without trying one of their deserts. They have some pretty creative dishes.  I certainly won't be waiting another couple years before I eat there again...Bistro 19 will be a regular on my list now!  They really do deserve more than 5 stars!",

I got the duck breast entree - seriously, some of the best duck I've had. Menu was wonderfully straight forward!

The server was very attentive and professional, and was also was not uptight. The atmosphere was nice. The place was filled, not one empty seat the entire time we were there. We had to make a reservation because this place is always so busy. The table we sat at was one in a row of maybe 6 tables, but was comfortable like I said.    We started off with the on special white wine and lemon pepper calamari. The calamari was made very nicely. It was not too crispy, which allowed the flavor to stand out. This was also served with a horseradish sauce.    The entrees we chose (which was difficult to choose) were the pork tenderloin and the lobster tail gnocchi. The pork was cooked perfectly. It was tender, not dry, with what tasted like a raspberry or sweet glaze/ sauce. It was also served with squash and a mound of mashed potatoes. The lobster and gnocchi was very good as well! The gnocchi was so perfectly cooked and the white sauce was so tasty! The lobster was also cooked very well. When I put the lemon over both the gnocchi and lobster made it gave it a whole new level of taste.    My husband wouldn't let me try his pistachio cheesecake! But it looked yum! I had the triple threat chocolate cake. I can not express the amount of joy I had received from this cake! It has to be the best chocolate cake I had ever experienced in my life! I will never forget it... *tear*    When the restaurant dimmed the lights, in the middle of dinner, the people in the restaurant all awed, ohhh'd and gasped. It was cute. I can not. Let me say that again. I can't not wait to come back! Double thumbs up!",

Special occasions to just a cozy dinner with my husband, my experiences are always consistent and excellent. The staff is warm, welcoming and extremely knowledgeable about everything on the menu.   My go-to's are typically the Chilean sea bass, scallops or salmon. Regardless of the current preparation they're always delicious. Another favorite of mine is the beef short ribs when they're on the menu. The menu changes seasonally, so there's always something new to try no matter how many times we return.   On our most recent visit, one new starter item that really stood out was the ahi tuna lettuce wraps. They were served with avocado and hoison sauce and were so,so good. The current salmon preparation was also excellent with mango salsa and coconut ginger rice.   If you're looking for a tried and True staple in Mt. Lebanon, look no further!",

Tasty sauce!), the lobster gnocci (also very good!!), the black tiger shrimp (did not try- had a lot of the artichoke dip in the shrimp with a powerful flavor)and the center cut filet (did not try.

When I had called about reservations for lunch I was told that they were necessary but recommended. I could see when I arrived at how packed this little place is.  I was in the mood for a salad so I opted for the salmon salad that had goat cheese and cranberries on it. I was served delicious bread and soft butter to go with it. I found my salad to be very good but thought the salmon slightly dry. Still it was a very good meal. Over at the next table the man had ordered chicken salad on a croissant that came with pasta salad. I heard him say, \"if they put anymore chicken in this croissant they would have to exclude the wings\" I could see if was huge and it looked very good. He later told me he enjoyed it and was worthwhile.  If you decide you want to order a sandwich or croissant it normally comes with a pasta salad. If you prefer French fries or sweet potato fries then there is a $2.00 upcharge.   My waitress was very friendly and attentive to my needs.  Bistro 19 is located in the Mt. Lebanon business district about 2 blocks from their parking garage. My recommendation is if you are driving then park here because the rates are very inexpensive.  I definitely wish to return here to try out their other offerings. Dinner is available too but again I would recommend you make a reservation. Lunch dress looked business casual and I would assume the same applies to dinner.",

I wish I'd thought to take pictures of it before we started eating. Everything was beautifully presented and delicious. I highly recommend a couple of the courses you could only get on the restaurant week special menu. The Sea bass corn tart with bacon guacamole & brown sugar and ginger seared tuna served with basmati, crispy carrots, and vegetable curry were amazing and my Dad really enjoyed his salmon, too.  Side note: Though they don't say it on their main page, they recommend reservations and we went early, but it's a very small restaurant and I can see it getting crowded easily. You need to call for reservations, but it's worth it to make sure you get a table!",

    "text": "I was really expecting to Love Bistro 19 judging by its reputation around the area, however, it proved to be just a nice, slightly above average meal.  First off, the staff was great. Absolutely no complaints about our service. The bartender was very sweet, helped us pick a bottle of wine, and was the highlight of our Bistro 19 experience.  We started our dinner with 2 appetizers. First was the calamari. It was cooked perfectly and had a very nice tempura style batter, however, the sauce it was served with was basically a lemon heavy tartar sauce. It turned a nice calamari into reminiscent of eating fish sticks while watching cartoons on a Saturday morning. Not that there's anything wrong with that, was just surprised that there wasn't more to it. Next we had a goat cheese bacon dip, which was good, but very heavy on the cream cheese, which is what I assume they used along with the goat cheese, resulting in a very dense dip. For my entree, I got the pork tenderloin. The portion size was very large for this style of restaurant, and overall it was very tasty. The sauce on the tenderloin was delicious, but the meat itself was a tad tough. The mashed potatoes and squash that accompanied the loin were both ok. My Girlfriend had the raviolis with mint and lobster, and they were very delicious. The mint added a very nice green freshness to the dish.   Overall, we had a very nice evening, and will most likely return. I'm a little more critical of 'fine dining' establishments, and while this was an enjoyable experience, there is definitely some room for improvement.",

The space offers a fairly decent sized dining room with a small bar enough for about 6-8 patrons. Also, there are some available tables outside when the weather permits.   The menu is a short list of appetizers, salads, and entrees. The other pages of the menu are occupied by the specialty cocktails, beers, and wines by the glass or the bottle.   For this visit I ordered the Butternut Squash Ravioli. The savory squash filling with the sweet cranberry brie butter was quite the combination. Definitely a solid choice. Pair those with crispy brussel sprouts and it was all in all a delicious dinner!",

We were celebrating a birthday here, and had a reservation. They were pretty accommodating for our rather large group (~10 people) in their smallish space. I got their grilled salmon salad sandwich, while the mister got his usual eggs benedict. Their sandwiches were good (everyone raves about the croissant), but the eggs were just so-so.  It definitely can be the star of a small town. Coming from a bigger Metropolitan area, this place is lacking a little bit -- perhaps in the freshness of the ingredients? Where Pittsburgh is situated, that could be a bit of a problem that isn't particularly the restaurant's fault.  When you're in town and want to go somewhere that's slightly nicer with a contemporary flair, this is the place.",

If I lived in Mount Lebanon, this could easily be one of my favorite places.  We started the meal with amazing complimentary bread and butter. The bread was served hot, and both my godmother and I lost track of the conversation when we tried the butter. What a way to start the meal!  We also ordered a hummus sampler, which came with plain, red pepper, and herb hummus. Again, holy cow. The red pepper hummus was absolutely spectacular. The plain and herb were also excellent, but we definitely polished off the red pepper first. Best of all, you can order this hummus for takeout  The actual meal was just as yummy. I LOVED the lobster macaroni and cheese, and it was loaded up with lobster. The actual Mac and cheese was delicious too.  My godmother ordered the crab cake, which was good, but it was definitely the weakest part of the meal. The sides were really odd, as rice and green beans did not go well with a crab cake.  Nonetheless, we really enjoyed our meals, and the lunch prices were crazy reasonable.  All the time while we were eating, we enjoyed some peach bellinis. They were very bubbly and a bit lacking in peach but all in all good.  There were loads of interesting drink options to choose from.  As we had heard from others that many unique characters come here, we were very excited to people watch. We were not disappointed on this front either, although the patrons are not controlled by the establishment.  The only downside is that their to-go containers leak really badly. All three of our boxes leaked.  Overall, this is a great place at lunch for a business meeting or nice meet up with friends. At dinner, it would be great for date night!",

It can get loud but is not as bad as other places I have been. The server was professional and very friendly.  We had reservations and we were seated immediately. The setting is intimate in the evening so I think it's best for small groups.   I think this is moderate on the price scale as we spent around $100 for 2 people including drinks and desserts. However, I think the delicious meal is definitely worth the price paid.   My only complaint is that my pumpkin ravioli were a little al dente for my taste. The calamari appetizer and Caesar salad was slightly lacking in flavor and I would try something else should I return. The tiger shrimp dinner was phenomenal and I highly recommend it! Both the banana foster Napoleon and bread pudding were fantastic and I would get either one again.  Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal and experience and will be back!",

These were open when we sat down and then the manager closed them. As he was closing them we overheard him using explicit language because he couldn't get the doors to shut properly. Now I'm not saying I don't drop swear words, because I do, but as a customer it seems a bit unprofessional.   On another note, the waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. She asked if we wanted more bread and that was a no brainer bc it was so GOOD! She was also great about filling our drinks. We both ordered the almond chicken with risotto and spinach. The chicken was good, a tad bit dry, but that Brie creme sauce helped out a bit. We both thought the chicken pieces were pretty small too for $20 a plate. The risotto was probably my favorite part because it wasn't overpowering with cheese. At this point I'm not sure how I feel about returning.",

My dinner partner ordered the steak salad which came with nice chunks of meat cooked to his liking. It had peppers, onions, and rosemary parents ran fries on too which I so gracefully stole one of those to try. He said it was one of the best steak salads he ever had.  The ambiance was nice but it is a small place. We made reservations and I recommend it there was a half hour wait to be seated when we arrived.

We had 8:30pm reservations and made the trek over just in time for dinner.  It is on the corner of a main drag in Mt Lebo and is super cozy and intimate when you walk in. Bobby and I agreed that Bistro has an excellent use of space and albeit sitting close to other diners, it didn't feel uncomfortable or too packed at any time - and most every table was full during our visit.  We started with the house pinot grigio and a jack on the rocks and after our bread & butter arrived, so did our lemon pepper calamari appetizer.  The bread was warm and fresh and the butter was soooo good.  The calamari was perfectly cooked, lightly breaded and served in a portion large enough for 4 or more people to share.  Bobby ordered the crab cakes (served with garlic mashed potatoes and perfectly cooked carrots) and I ordered the almond chicken (served with a risotto and cooked spinach).  Portions were extremely generous - enough to eat half and take the other half home to eat later. Everything was absolutely delicious.  I noticed that while at most restaurants, food comes out warm, but here, our food came out piping hot. The crab cakes were huge and with lumps of tender crab and the mashed potatoes garlicky, and carrots perfectly cooked and flavorful.  My chicken was tender and juicy and the risotto was cheesy and amazing with garlic butter spinach that was not too bland or mushy.  Our service was good, our waitress attentive and friendly.  The desserts at the table next to us looked good, but we were too full to try.  I had high expectations based on the photos other reviewers have posted here, and they were exceeded in both presentation and flavor of the food we had Saturday night.  I would totally love to try every entree and appetizer on the menu and I've already said I want to come back for my birthday in April. It was an easy 5 stars.",

I ordered \"what they're know for\" (as the waitress said), the Chilean Seabass. Another bold statement, it may be one of the best dishes I've ever had! It was so light and fluffy, but packed with flavor. Mainly because the horseradish glaze was out of control good. Add on a delicious mix of slaw and rice and it was the perfect dish.

I started off the night with an \"Apples and Pears\" cocktail which consisted of apple infused Boyd & Blair vodka, pear nectar, Angostura bitters, vanilla-nutmeg syrup, fresh lime juice, and hard cider. It was like someone poured the spirit of Christmas into a mason jar-- perfectly spiced and perfectly wonderful.  After drinks, we ordered a trio of hummus to share: plain, pesto, and red pepper. The hummus was a hit.   Next came a basket of bread and butter. The butter got some major praise around the table. I inquired about the butter because it was just too good and I couldn't place the flavors. Turns out it's a honey and chive whipped butter. Who knew that those flavors would go together so well.   We all decided to try out the Restaurant Week special menu. For $35.16 we got to pick between two appetizers, two main courses, and two dessert options. I opted for the wild burgundy snails and leek goat cheese fondue on a baguette for my first course,  the roasted lamb gnocchi for my second course, and chocolate bundt cake to round it out.  The snails were good and the cake was good, but the lamb + gnocchi really stole the show. The lamb was so tender and with just the right amount of fat, that it practically melted in my mouth. The gnocchi were seasoned perfectly and cooked perfectly. I think I lost the ability to speak for a good 15 minutes. The only sounds I could make were repeated \"mmmmmms\". It was definitely one of the best dishes I've eaten in Pittsburgh.  Overall, it was a great experience. The service was top-notch and the atmosphere was the perfect mixture of comfy and classy. My only regret is not trying Bistro 19 sooner. Just think of how many honey chive butter experiences I could have had by now if I visited 5 years ago when I first heard of the place....",

    "text": "Apparently our money wasn't good enough. We have some friends in town and wanted to treat them to a nice brunch. We noticed on their restaurant website that they recommended reservations. They open at 11, so we started calling their restaurant at 9 AM. We tried several times to get through and no answers. There, also, wasn't an online option for making reservations. We showed up as soon as they opened and requested a table. We noticed they barely had any customers and plenty of large tables were empty. They informed us they won't seat us without a reservation. We asked them how could we make a reservation when no one in their restaurant was answering the phone. They informed us that none of their wait staff even showed up until 10 minutes ago. So... No one comes in to prep the kitchen? What about their management team? Instead of providing some answers, their very rude hostess walked away. I'm very disappointed because my boyfriend and I had had a previous good experience at Bistro 19. We didn't expect to be treated like garbage today.  I wouldn't have been angry if their staff and politely informed us that they already had their tables reserved for other clients. I wouldn't have been angry if their website stated reservations were mandatory. Instead, we were talked down to and given no explanations why they wouldn't seat paying clients in a mostly empty restaurant. None of us were wearing offensive clothing or tattoos. We were all clean and dressed nicely. I can't think of any reasonable explanation (barring outlandish things like prejudice, since our group was of mixed race and we had a disabled individual - and I definitely hope this wasn't the case) why any restaurant would turn us away if they had tables available.",

You're also very close to the tables next to you, I could hear conversations happening all around me.   Food: The bread basket is delightful, fresh warm bread served with a sweet cream butter. Ordered the filet mignon and lobster gnocchi. Both were delicious. The meat dish had a lovely red wine reduction, the lobster tail was a decent size and well seasoned.   All in all a good meal, however, there are so many great places with very imaginative menu options, and Bistro 19 seems like a very basic and ordinary menu done well. Enjoyed my time there but wasn't blown away.",

Be advised that if you do not have a reservation and intend to sit at the bar, you should plan to arrive at opening as bar seats are also highly coveted. It was a hot day so we were lucky enough to be some of the only people interested in dining outside. Lucky for us, the sun was starting to set so it did cool off as the evening progressed. Our server was wonderful, he recommendation for a crisp white wine was right on point and her knowledge of the menu extensive. I had heard such amazing things about the seabass but wasn't in love with the described side dishes. My fears were baseless as this seabass was truly the most amazing preparation I've ever had. It was perfectly prepared and just divine. I can't wait to return!!!",

    "text": "An outstanding dinner with our road crew tonight. B19 took our short- notice reservation with the qualifier that we try to contain our meal to two hours due to a later group coming in. No problem...although interestingly, a credit card was requested \"in case we didn't show\"...  When we got in, table had already been prepared and we were seated immediately. Table service was also immediate, menus were available and water was offered. This was a very nice menu including some beef, lamb, pork, chicken, and fish. There were even a couple of options available that made our vegan member quite happy.  The group ordered drinks, then our mains as well. I had the Chilean sea bass with the horseradish crust.  There was no argument when we requested substitutions - I chose grilled asparagus over the Napa slaw - and then we settled in and waited.  We're not a quiet group but the level of conversation and the ambiance in Bistro 19 worked well for us.  We may have been the least well dressed and quite possibly the aggregate youngest group in the restaurant but we were treated with a level of respect which appropriately reflected the professionalism of the wait staff.  Within a reasonable amount of time, our dinners were delivered.  Portions were adequate, and well-presented.  Always a bellwether for a restaurant, our pickiest eater admired, and then devoured her filet.  This is someone for whom a clean plate is foreign and, upon reflection, said that her steak was perfectly prepared and that the flavor of the toppings was \"exotic\".  Equally pleased was our group leader who wanted nothing more than the Bistro Burger.  He mentioned that it was one of the best burgers he'd had in a long while.  I certainly enjoyed my fish - the light but evenly cooked and seasoned crust was superb and the asparagus was very nicely prepared.  The macadamia rice was a bit of a let down, a bit dry and not overly flavorful but really didn't distract from the balance of the dish.  While desert was offered, we'd noticed a Grater's Ice Cream store down the road and chose to head over there rather than take B19 up on their offerings.  Maybe a pedestrian choice but we're a pretty generic group.  Total bill was $770 (including the aforementioned 20% gratuity).  Quite reasonable for a dozen diners, several drinks, and even a couple of bottles of a nice chardonnay. If we're ever back in the area, we'll be back.",

I was promptly greeted by a friendly waiter who provided us with excellent service throughout the night.   We each started with wine - a red for me and a white for her - and enjoyed the selections very much. I also had a nineteeni which was good, but not anything special.   We started with the cheese plate and salmon sliders. I loved the cheese plate and the nice spread and selection of crackers, fruits and toppings. It included a cheddar, Swiss, and bleu cheese. The salmon sliders left me underwhelmed, lacking a punchy flavor. However, I did enjoy the paired sweet potato fries!   We split the special for the evening - lobster ravioli. This was fabulous! A creamy sauce with lobster both in the sauce and in the pasta.   We finished with the cookie skillet which is pretty much as good as it sounds and that's all there is to say about that :)  A great place if you're in Mt. Lebanon!",

The wait staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and quick on refills. There was a pretty decent beer list. The menu was on the smaller side, which is a good sign that the food is fresh.   I ordered the Bistro Burger. The patty was cooked medium, the way I ordered. It came with a roasted garlic ketchup, which I don't think was prepared well; it was very watery and leaked everywhere, soaking the plate. Perhaps a thicker ketchup, or even changing it to a spicy ketchup would better complement the burger. There could have been a better melt on the cheese as well. The French fries were great. It's surprising how many restaurants can't get French fries right. This restaurant has a lot going for it, so I'd love to come back and try something different.",

I called the day of and the first available for two people was around 8:15 (we got there by seven and luckily grabbed a seat at the bar instead of waiting until 8:15)  Bartenders were slammed, still managed to remain attentive on a Saturday evening.  It was my b day weekend so we went all out, our appetizer was a seasonal flatbread with figs... YUM.... amazing.... my entree was the scallops, which were Hot and full of flavor. My friend got friend he duck, it came with seasonal risotto and it was phenomenal!! For dessert we had both the pumpkin pie cheesecake, and banana foster. Foster looked pretty but the cheesecake was OUT OF THIS WORLD!  I will be coming back to bistro 19, ASAP... I also recommend this restaurant to anyone for any occasion. It's nice enough to be a \"nice night out\" but wouldn't say it's \"too nice\" to just stop by on a weeknight for no special occasion. Highly recommend!   On a side note: I would feel that the menu changes frequently, last night there were TONS of fall notes included, pumpkin puree.. apple puree, figs, just a total combination of tall flavors.. loved every",

After a tiring bowling night, this was among the few options that were still open at 9:30 pm and they also have a good rating on Yelp.   Our waitress was friendly and nice. Service was on time. They offered some bread like any other high end restaurant. We ordered two staters: colossal lump crab cocktail and lamb flat bread; and two entree items: almond chicken and bay of Fundy salmon. It  was a sufficient quantity for four of us.  Starters first! Crab cocktail is cooked crab served over a bed of fresh ripe mango salsa and avacado. It had a subtle tangy flavor. There are other ingredients too, but  these were noticeable. Its an amazingly refreshing touch to the palette. I definitely recommend this dish. Coming to the lamb flat bread. It is lamb meat balls, feta cheese, tomatoes, arugula and fresh yogurt sauce served over a naan. The best part of this dish is the juicy well cooked lamb. If you like lamb, you should definitely try this.   Now the entrees, my favorite is almond chicken. This dish is on the sweeter side. I liked it very much especially the combination with creamy risotto and spinach. If you are a greens lover, do give this a try! Ok...the salmon. I am not a big fan of salmon. So, I will just discuss about the well cooked basmati rice served with a mildly spicy sauce which might consist of cream and butter. My friends liked the salmon too.   Overall, it was a good experience and it would have been a great experience if we were prepared for a fine dining experience. Will go back again for a date night!",

    "text": "Wow! I loved Bistro 19 last night. We have lived in the are for a long time and have never stopped in until now. My boyfriend took me here for my birthday dinner and made a reservation in advance. It was very busy on a Friday night, so I recommend having a reservation. Our waitress was very nice and accommodating the entire evening. The drink and cocktail menu was lengthy and I decided to go with the prosecco, it was delicious. They give you bread to start with and the best butter ever, haha. Yum!For dinner, I couldn't decide between the Black Tiger Shrimp or the Crabcakes. I'm glad that I went with the Black Tiger Shrimp because it was honestly one of the best meals I've had in a long time. It was stuffed and topped with a rich cream sauce and had spinach and risotto on the side. My boyfriend ordered the Pork and he also didn't have anything left on his place once he was done. We got the Chocolate Cake for dessert which was also very good. The only thing was that my ice cream came out already melted, but the woman did apologize for that. Staff was very nice. It is an upscale dining and pricy meal, but a night out once in a while made it worth it for the nice evening we were able to have. We will be back in the future for sure!",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and after our latest visit, I feel Bistro 19 definitely deserves a 5 star review. Although I haven't been impressed in the past, their menu changed from what I remember from years ago (and I believe it might change quite often with what is in season). I loved everything about this most recent visit.   Between my husband and I, we ordered the French onion soup, salmon sliders, sea scallops, and pork tenderloin. Everything was on point. French onion soup was one of the best I've had. The salmon sliders were flavorful and the yogurt sauce on them created a refreshing flavor to balance with the rich salmon. The sea scallops were one of the best scallop dishes I've ever had; they were perfectly seared and seasoned, with a sweet yet savory sauce. It was paired with a polenta and the combinations were perfect. The pork tenderloin was also fantastic with great balances of sweet and savory. According to our waitress, the pork tenderloin is one of their most popular dishes.   The decor is very sleek and modern, while the space is rather small. We came here on a weeknight  so it wasn't too busy; we were able to get a table with no problems. However, I would imagine dinner on a weekend would require a reservation.   A place that has some dishes that I can rate as \"one of the best I've ever had\" definitely deserves five stars! Highly recommend Bistro 19!",

    "text": "My first review for Bistro 19 would have been 4 years ago and it would have been 5 stars. After our brunch experience today, and a few other lackluster experiences in the recent past, I'm really over it.   I ordered the duck waffles. What I got was a singular waffle, soft as a microwaved Eggo waffle, and only slightly less dense than a bad scone. I'm not exaggerating here, the waffle was utter shit, I can't believe they would serve it like that. A meager sprinkling of some chunks of duck confit lay hidden under two over easy eggs. What little syrup the dish had on it was already absorbed by the waffle. There was a memory of bacon somewhere in there. Oh, and there were also some not-at-all crispy sweet potato home fries buried in there also. I'm not just going to whine here, the dish sucked but could be easily fixed. Use belgian waffles (or fix your fucked up waffle and change the name of the dish to reflect its singular nature), put two medium sized ones on that plate, maybe one mounting the other. Place the over easy eggs, one each, on top of those waffles. Take those chunks of confit and put it right in front of my face, in a little mound on top of each egg. Then hit it with some sprinkles of crispy bacon. Drizzle that damn syrup over all of it, being careful to leave some on the plate that won't be absorbed by the waffle, so I can drag each bite through some as I sit there satisfied by what was put in front of me.  My wife's meal was not much better. The smoked salmon brunch crostini. I suppose by crostini, what they meant was a piece of bread, likely pre-toasted in an oven, then soaked in oil and let to warm on a flat top, just until parts of it burned and the crust became so tough it needed cut with a knife. Crostini should be crispy, the oil should be there to help that happen. The scrambled eggs with it were forgettable, the salmon was meh, and the side salad stayed within that theme. Really, it wouldn't have been so bad if they had just made that crostini right, I mean holy shit, the most basic part of the dish and the anchor of the whole thing and to just mercilessly fuck it that hard, come on, sheesh.   I've had a lot worse. I ate everything because I was hungry. But it just makes me mad that the execution was so poor on these dishes. I take more effort cooking things I serve myself.  Oh and serve some better coffee for christ's sake.",

We had a reservation which was a great idea because it was pretty busy and the space is actually pretty small.  They have a great wine list and cocktails. I got the hibiscus bubbly and it was awesome  my fiance got the salted pear or salty pear I can not remember the name and it was also good!  We started with lemon pepper calamari which was good but not as lemon peppered as I anticipated with that being the name.   I got the black tiger shrimp which came stuffed and with risotto which I loved! It had a tomato based sauce on it too. Amazing. My fiance got a pot roast type dish which was also very good.   The food was great but I would say the only thing that made me not give it a 5 star was our server. She was a bit stand offish and harsh. At one point she was pouring water into my glass and I wanted to order another drink and she said something short and walked away eventually coming back but it was a bit rude. I also ordered a 12$ glass of wine and she took it away with two sips left without even asking if I was done with it which I wasn't.",

To start my Sunday off right, I ordered their Villa Mosa, a cocktail made with prosecco and limoncello. The tangy flavor of lemon infused with the bubbly taste of prosecco was refreshing and delicious.  My brunch order was Eggs Benedict - perfectly poached eggs on a fresh toasted croissant smothered in creamy hollandaise sauce and garnished with crumbled prosciutto. If that wasn't enough decadence, this dish comes with a side of golden brown home fried potatoes. Steven ordered their Bananas Foster Pancakes. One word - amazing! The Bananas Foster sauce was caramelized golden goodness and a perfect pairing for the glazed bananas as well as the pancake. I will definitely be back for more. Kudos Bistro 19!",

I have a list of restaurants in Pgh to try and this was on my list...I would be fine with going if someone else wanted to, but I don't think I would specifically choose this place again.     We had the crab grilled cheese appetizer, which was very good!  I saw another table get calamari and it looked very good as well.   The salad was fine.    I got the fillet and it was good.  As good as we make it at home but not amazing.   Which to me is a bit of a let down.  We cook pretty well at our house but when we go to a nicer place we expect it to be better than what we can make at home since these are professional chefs.    My husband was very excited about the Local Game Duo until he tasted it.  I had a bit of each the venison and the bison.  They were both terrible cuts of meat, incredibly tough.  I couldn't even finish the venison bite.  He said his whole meal was like that.    My husband LOVED his dessert (Banana Foster Napoleon).   I got the Elvis bread pudding as the server said it was his favorite.   It seemed different from anything I'd seen before which is usually a good omen*.  It was interesting, not something I would get again.   I'm sure the other desserts are good.   So overall a decent place, but I'm not in love with it.   * We read something a long time ago that said if you ordered the most odd or out there item on the menu, it will most like be the best thing you've ever eaten.  I would say that is True about 90% of the time :)",

I ordered the scallops at a price of $25. I was expecting at least six at a good size but I got four at a very small size. I was done with my dinner in two minutes. That comes out to over $8 for each scallop. Come on Bistro 19. I don't mind paying to go to a nicer restaurant but I don't like being robbed either.

My sister's sweet potato fries were delicious. The service was decent, but we had told our server what time we needed to leave and we waited quite a while for her to give us a check (we were almost late for our appointment).

We had the Egg White Frittata, Eggs Benedict, Bistro Brunch, Chocolate Raspberry Pancakes (we actually shared this as there were too many yummy items on the menu) and Omelet.  Drink were also fab...even the \"virgin\" Bloody Mary was really good;) The service was quite good-attentive but not smothering.  We left happy and just right stuffed.  A great placed to go for Sunday brunch without being rushed or uncomfortably stuffed.",

    "text": "I'm not sure who rated the prices as $$$, but at least for lunch, the selections are really reasonably priced, and perfectly sized. The Cuban sandwich, which was delicious, stuffed with pulled pork and gruyere, was $9 with a side of fries. It's not a $1 slice of pizza, but I don't think $9 warrants any \"overpriced\" concerns.  Our charming server, Mick, was helpful -- with suggestions and information on the menu -- but unobtrusive. Bistro 19 was a pleasant surprise on a trip to see the parents -- the kind of place I'm glad to see reappearing on Washington Road.",

    "text": "Girls' Dinner Club visited for Restaurant Week. This review is strictly based on the $30 restaurant week menu/$15 wine pairing. My opinion on Restaurant Week is that the menus should highlight the skill and direction of the restaurant, which unfortunately I do not think Bistro 19 was effective in doing. Regular menu prices are $19-30 for entrees, $8-15 wines by the glass. They also regularly do special dinners, one of which coming up is a local corn dinner (all dishes made with corn!).   Service was great - timely, and unobtrusive. Appetizers were the highlight of the meal. I had a watermelon crab gazpacho, that started a little sweet, and finished with a hint of spice. Fresh lump crab and a beautiful deep red color. This is one I will try to reproduce. Entrees were a little blase. Options were a Parm/Panko crusted chicken with whipped potatoes and zucchini salad; or salmon with a lime-caramel glaze, green beans, and a chilled asian noodle salad. The chicken dish was all one color, which to me was generally unappealing - but the crowd seemed to approve. Salmon was dry (although I will admit, I am a salmon elitist and since having it sous vide, salmon will never be the same) and the glaze was non-apparent. The green beans were the best part of the plate. There was a third dish offered; a pasta with alfredo, which no one ordered so I can't comment, but pasta with alfredo is a little 1998.    At the end of the day, the food was just nothing special. It has good intention, but execution missed the mark.   My inner environmentalist also has a big concern with the sustainability factor here. Bay of Fundy salmon was a highlight on the restaurant week menu. The chef's 'signature' dish is Chilean Sea Bass. Unless the restaurant could ensure they were purchasing MSC-certified fish, I would hesitate to order any seafood here because I do not agree with the philosophy of serving endangered fishes.   I like the ambiance; its a cool interior with a nice little bar area - modern, but warm at the same time. Sounds like I need to head back and try this Asian Pear Martini that everyone raves about!",

We were the only people in there so we sat at the bar.  My original plan was to have my standard crab cake but after talking with the wonderful bartenders (2 women, can't remember their names...bad me!) while having my cocktail, I opted for Bay of Fundy Salmon with maple Dijon glaze and goat cheese and pecans.  OMGOSH!  What was I thinking to never order this dish?  It was absolutely incredible!  I have never had a salmon dish done so perfectly.  The glaze and the toppings (pecans and goat cheese) were made in heaven for the salmon....it was beyond amazing.  I must have groaned with delight about 50 times during my meal!  It comes with their simple but wonderful herbed basmati rice and asparagus. My lunch date had the daily special of a chicken wrap--he was thrilled with his choice as well (also recommended by the bartenders).  As luck would also have it, a wine rep came in while we were having lunch and we were invited to do some tastings with the manager, the rep and the bartender. We truly struck gold on our visit yesterday!  Great way to spend a cold, dreary Monday afternoon!",

    "text": "I ate here this past Wednesday night with my girlfriend for dinner.  We had been wanting to come and eat at Bistro for awhile and their Pittsburgh Restaurant Week menu finally gave us the push that we needed.  I had made 7:30 reservations a week or so prior to coming here and we a little before that time.  Around 15 minutes later we were seated at our table.  The inside of the restaurant is actually smaller than I expected but clean and modern.  A bar dominates one side while the dining room has most of the other side.  Since it was Pittsburgh restaurant week my girlfriend and I both went with the 3 course pre-fixe menu.  I decided to start out with the braised pork Mac and cheese followed by a coffee crusted mahi mahi before finishing with a coffee panna cotta. My girlfriend started with the pumpkin cappuccino soup followed by the white balsamic chicken with red wine risotto and finished with the butterscotch rice pudding.  Our first courses came out in a short amount of time and looked fantastic.  The flavors on my Mac and cheese were awesome and I was really enjoying it.  Sadly the pork part on it was dried and hard which I didn't mind too much and it still had some good flavors but it was still slightly disappointing.  In the meantime my girlfriends soup was awesome with a rich pumpkin flavor and some spices.  My entree was the coffee rubbed mahi mahi with yucca puree, candied kumquats, coconut rice and some asparagus spears. My favorite part of the meal was eating the kumquats with the yucca puree as the kumquats had a great citrusy sweet and sour quality while the puree was thick and creamy.  The mahi mahi was cooked nicely but I couldn't taste any of the coffee rub which I thought was a shame as the fish was supposed to be the star of this dish.  My girlfriend sad that her chicken was a little dry but that she enjoyed the red wine risotto and could taste some of the wine in it.  Whenever our desserts came, they both looked good.  Since I normally share at least a piece of everything with my girlfriend and vice versa, she thankfully took the first bit of my panna cotta which revealed a chocolate crust to it.  Normally this would not be a big deal except for the fact that I specifically asked our waiter if the panna cotta had any chocolate in it before ordering to which he responded that it did not.  While I did not state the reason for my asking (chocolate gives me migraines), I would think that a waiter who does not know what is in a dessert would go and check as there could be other issues involved.  Instead of having to return the dessert, my girlfriend ended up keeping it and gave me her butterscotch rice pudding which would have been what I would have ordered anyways.  The pudding was good enough but did little to allay my unhappiness over the fact that I could have had a migraine from eating the panna cotta.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back her again in the future but I would hope that the servers would be better informed.  Their food by itself probably deserves at least a 4 star rating but I was very disappointed with the fact that the server did not know the menu as it could cause issues in the future, especially if someone has a bad allergy to a food.",

Our waitress immediately offered to get me something else (which I love it when they listen to you and don't waste your time with excuses) but I'm just not that person that sends food back unless it is uneatable! I asked her to just box it and thought I would try again the next day (love Leftovers). I love scallops - look how beautiful this dish is!! I wanted to love this! Tried it the next day and realized it was not table salt salty it was more Sea Salt really salty, couldn't eat it - would we go back YES had a great evening with amazing staff - I would address the issue before I order this again because I'm thinking it was a fluke - I want to love this dish -",

Parking can be tight on the main road, however we lucked out and got one right across the street. It's a small bistro, however they managed to give it a bigger feel with the decor, separation between the bar area and dining area, and the open windows. Our waitress was really great. The accommodated my peanut allergy better than any other restaurant we've been to. Both our waitress and the manager checked on us to reassure us that nothing had nuts and he substituted bread that he can guarantee wasn't processed in a facility that also had nuts! So nice to be taken care of like that! I had a glass of wine, the salmon sliders and sweet potato fries to start, while J had the cheese plate w/o nuts. J's plate came with both an apricot spread and honey, and were delicious. The cucumber dill on my salmon sliders was pretty good. For our entrees, J had the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and carrots ( he didn't want the asparagus). I had sesame crusted salmon with ginger basmati rice and green beans.  Both of our meals were so good! We cleaned our plates, which is rare for us as we both tend to take food home. We were full, but didn't want to stop eating because everything was delicious! For dessert, we had ice cream. J had two scoops of chocolate and I had one scoop of chocolate and one scoop of salted caramel. The salted caramel was so good! All in all, the bill came to about $100 which isn't bad considering all the stuff we ate. The best part for us was that all of their ingredients come from local sources. We definitely recommend coming here!",

I was feeling good after the USA Hockey triumph over Canada at the 2013 World Junior Tournament, so I honored out \"neighbours to the North\" with my selection of the Maple Leaf cocktail and the Maple Leaf farms duck breast. I don't care for Brussels sprouts, and I substituted baby carrots.  First, the cocktail: Knob Creek Bourbon, maple syrup, lemon wedge. I'm not sure the ratio of maple syrup, but it wasn't too sweet. There was enough syrup to get that maple flavor, especially toward the end of the drink.   We also had some calamari, and the remoulade was a highlight. The breading was light and the firmness of the calamari was just right. Wedding soup was on special. I would have liked some parmesan on top in retrospect. It wasn't offered, but I also didn't ask.  The duck was cooked to good temperature and the skin was not too chewy or tough as I've experienced in a few other places.  I look forward to another visit next time I'm in town.",

Rich and buttery from the fatty fish. The slaw and rice weren't drowning in dressing like before--the cabbage was crisp and not overpowered. I got the sea scallops (waitress recommended this over barramundi) and it was spot on. Perfect sear, perfect doneness, perfectly seasoned. Balsamic reduction on grilled asparagus was complementary to the richness of the spring pea risotto. Cappuccino creme brulee. Nailed it... topping crispy and caramelized instead of the soggy mess of my last visit. Seriously like night and day from my before. Glad I returned! Will definitely return :)",

I had the grilled vegetable stack which was ok but a little bland. Then I had the Bay of Fundy salmon. The salmon was cooked perfect and came with kale chips quinoa. The flavor of everything was again just kind of bland. If you're watching what you eat this dish is perfect but I would have liked a little more flavor and would have liked a warm quinoa instead of cold.

Our favorite menu items are the tiger shrimp, steak & baked eggs, grilled vegetable stack, any of their soups, almond chicken, and duck breast.   The restaurant can get rather loud for dinner (esp between 7-9pm), but it's all part of the atmosphere of a small, trendy bistro restaurant!",
