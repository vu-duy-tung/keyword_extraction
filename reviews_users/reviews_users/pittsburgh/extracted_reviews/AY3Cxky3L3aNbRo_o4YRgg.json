Unfortunately, it was on the cold side today so they were closed up. The place was packed. The coffee was delicious. They participate in the Coffee Passport program as well. Overall, a beautiful addition to the Pittsburgh Coffee Scene.",

While De Fer makes better use of the space than the prior tenant, the coffee comes at slightly higher price point than before. We ordered the drip coffee and white peony tea, both of which were tasty but nothing to write home about. Extra points for the friendly & knowledge staff, as well as the little chocolates they give with each drink order. I'd certainly come back to explore the very reasonable priced food and alcoholic drink menu, which sets them apart from the other coffee shops in the city.",

    "text": "Love this place! Huge upgrade on the previous coffee place that was in this space.  There is a fair amount of seating (main floor, upstairs balcony, and three sidewalk tables) and the overall coffee-shop design is a clean and simple industrial look. Love little touches like the milky pastel colors for the chairs and coffee cups, lots of natural light, interesting art, etc. Staff is EXTREMELY kind, attentive, and engaging, especially if it's not super busy. Quiet during the day, even if the garage door is up and street noise intrudes.   Coffee drinks are good. Definitely not as fussy as some places, and there are some interesting sweeter options (cortado with maple syrup and their affogato, for instance). They have a limited menu (some breakfast items, panini, meat/cheese plates, and toast), but also have periodic burger nights. They also usually have some interesting pastry options in the case. Definitely highly recommend the yeasted buckwheat waffle with fresh fruit, whipped cream, and a drizzle of maple syrup. Unexpectedly light, slightly crispy, and not at all too sweet. They also have a cocktail menu, wine, and beer, which I haven't fully explored, but the Tango Nuevo cocktail is of particular note for how awesome it is.   Small kitchen/play area for kids, which I think is a really nice touch and helps to welcome a different set of customers into the space.  They have live music nights periodically. These definitely get noisy and the staff encourage the customers to pay attention to the acts/do less chatting...so if you're headed to De Fer on a live music night, it's probably not going to be the best time for an intimate conversation with the person across the table. But they're great and feature a pretty wide mix of styles/performers with a vague thematic element to curate the overall event.  For laptop folks--the outlet situation isn't awesome throughout parts of the space, so that's something to be aware of if you're planning to camp.   Overall, I find it a very welcoming, bright, and thoughtfully managed place!",

Top notch preparation of espresso drinks, and the daily roasts and pour overs are tremendous.   Gone is the coffee arrogance of the former owners, in its place is friendly staff that will guide you to the best beans for your cup, and won't look askance if you want to dump a quart of cream in your coffee.  (Don't do that, but you get the idea.)  There is a small menu, and while food is not the focus of the place, the paninis, pastries and the like are wonderful.   If you're in the Strip District, stop by.  If you're not, then go there anyway.",

The staff are always super friendly and helpful, and they have a great selection of beverages that taste fantastic (seriously, I haven't had one I didn't like, and I've had like 20 different ones.) They also have a myriad of events throughout each month--everything from guest chefs cooking burgers to live music. The atmosphere is usually pretty quiet, and a great place to meet up with a friend for conversation. My favorite drink here is an iced P.A. Cubano, which is sweetened with Pennsylvania maple syrup, but I am also a big fan of their teas, of which they have a huge variety. As far as food, I'd say the best of their sandwiches is the prosciutto one, and their waffles with berries absolutely hit the spot every time. The chai-baked oatmeal is also a great snack. Bottom is if you're looking for a place to hang with someone in the Strip District, sip tasty drinks, and maybe have a snack, this is the place.",

Whenever we visit New Orleans, we go to this cafe called EnVie, and every time I wish we had something similar in Pittsburgh: A relaxed space where you can get coffee OR alcohol, or both in an Irish coffee! Well, I can happily say De Fer is that place. You can sit with a coffee and work on your laptop, or enjoy some day drinking and brunching on a day off.   The coffee itself is wonderful. My husband is extremely particular about his espresso, and De Fer is now one of the few coffee shops he knows he can reliably get an espresso that's to his liking. I am much less particular, but enjoyed both drip coffee, and the maple-sweetened PA Cubano.   I haven't tried any of the alcohol offerings yet, but my dad is a Negroni fan, and said theirs was excellent. De Fer offers beer (including Iron City for when you need a budget option), wine, and some awesome sounding cocktails featuring mostly local spirits. They have an entire list of bottle-rested negronis, which I am excited to try.  Food options look great, featuring pastries from the to-die-for La Gourmandine. I will certainly update when I try the food here.  I really love that they have children's books to read with your little ones; it's a nice touch that made me feel especially welcome with my baby.",

Big blank slate boards on the wall suggest they're planning ahead.  Exceptionally spacious, the location seems to encourage lingering. The chairs and tables aren't quite cozy but, it'll no doubt be a fine coffice for more than a few freelancers. Roasting equipment may move in upstairs, I hear. De Fer will not only be blending and roasting beans, but teas. Indie tea blenders are too rare these days.   On a slow second-to-opening day, I was offered a taste two distinct espressos, ordered a cortado with one, bought a bag of beans of the other. The bag's blend, Sons of Vulcan, is a reference to steel workers, but also Star Trek, in my mind. It lent itself well to tiramisu.",

Luckily that hidden gem is right here in the Strip District. I hate to share this place since I know more people will end up here, but it's too good not to share with locals and tourists alike! My fiance and I ordered the Affogato (with lemon ice cream...sounds crazy but the flavors complement each other) and the PA Cubano. Best cubano I've had since Colada in Fort Lauderdale, Florida - iced coffee that's a little bit sweet. Can't wait to visit these guys again soon to get my new Yinz fix - the PA Cubano.",

After tasting his I wished I had gotten what he got!  Whatever brew he got had almost a slight sour taste but a deliciously nutty aftertaste.  It was really unique and enjoyable.  My latte was very good as well but not as interesting as his coffee's flavor.  The space was large but not very cozy.  Very nice spot however and worth the walk!",

While visiting the area, we went here twice and each time I was excellently guided to make a correct choice in beans, espresso and even non-dairy milk to complement the flavors. It was all perfect. Very comfortable table areas with good lighting. I purchased some beans to enjoy in our home and their subtle nuances continue to seep through. It is always refreshing to find such a great coffee shop that emphasizes excellence, knowledge, real mugs (not just paper cups) and willingly shares that with us. I enjoyed browsing their shelves with local products. My husband is not a coffee drinker but he did indulge in a flaky pastry that was fresh and flavorful.",

    "text": "A beautiful space, friendly service, but my drink was of extremely poor quality. I ordered a cortado, which is something that you can find beautifully prepared at almost every well-known craft coffee shop in this city (which there a number of) and I was very disappointed to find the milk steamed quite poorly. I won't pretend to be able to taste espresso clearly through milk, but even that seemed to be rather sour. Additionally, I found it odd that the cortado was not served in a clear glass (something which you traditionally find in most shops) but this is just a matter of personal preference. I think they need to spend some time on barista training.    I will reiterate that the staff was extremely kind and attentive.   My point is this: it is no secret that this place poached this former location of the excellent (although historically notorious for customer service) 21st Street Coffee and Tea. Nevermind my fondness for the former business, I would remain wary of an establishment that selectively engages with a community, but runs out other local businesses for its own benefit, and then can't quite deliver on the goods.",

The baristas were passionate and knowledgeable about coffee and took their time to make sure the drink was perfect before it would hit the counter. De Fer has the right idea with the menu and decor but needs barista training. Shots are pulled incorrectly  (they have a scale and timers but not used) and drinks (particularly the mocha) needs a lot of work. Way too sweet, almost undrinkable, and the the milk wasn't even steamed correctly. (No micro foam, very Starbucks like mix mash of some milk and espresso). There's a lot of competition in Pittsburgh. Great coffee shops, talented baristas, and coffee consumers that raise the bar in quality and expectation. De Fer needs to get off on the right foot by surrounding themselves with passionate people. Especially in such an iconic location.",

I was unsure what to try so I asked the barista what they recommended. I ended up getting a strawberry spritzer (I cant remember the exact name but it was awesome.)   I was so impressed with my first visit I brought my girlfriend here about a week later. We both got the same drink I tried my first visit. She wasn't as much of a fan as I was but she still enjoyed it. We also tried a dessert and it didn't disappoint! After our dessert we asked the barista if we could try the different kombuchas on tap. We tried two different kinds and each sample was huge!   **FYI** be sure to bring your ID here if you're into getting kombucha. The alcohol content is high so they have to card you if you want to have some/try it.   Everything I've tried so far has been delicious. This is a must go to place when you're in the strip!   The service and staff here are really welcoming and helpful for first time visitors. The vibes here are awesome, if it's warm enough they open the garage door on the front and there is a loft!",

Here's my breakdown of this place:  FACILITY - It's beautiful and clean.  Narrow and very deep, I love the old, exposed brick walls and wooden floors.  It feels like what it is - an old, re-purposed space in the Strip District.  So 5-stars for the space and environment.  COFFEE DRINKS - Quite good.  Espresso is smooth with good, golden foam on top, and just enough \"bite\" at the end of each sip.  I like La Prima (also in the strip) better, though...  And, wow, their drinks are expensive (relative to great, nearby competitors).  COFFEE BEANS - I make espresso and other coffee drinks at home, so of course, I grind my own beans.  They roast their own beans here, but are a bit proud of them:  $20+ per pound is almost double what GREAT competitors charge (e.g., Allegheny Coffee & Tea exchange, one block away; Prestogeorge's, also one block away; Nicholas Coffee in Market Square).  So overall, I'm let down by the unobtainable bean pricing, and a bit by the coffee drinks pricing.  I'm no cheapskate, but this place just feels badly to me, and the notion of ridiculously priced beans in Pittsburgh, in the Strip District, like it's tourist-bait, just doesn't sit well with me...",

The cafe tables and Tiffany blue chairs promoted a subtle chic vibe with an air of carefree whimsy. The murals and local artist's work on the walls add a bit of color and flavor to the environment, but overall the cafe offers a sanctuary from the hustle and bustle of the outside world. The crowd was a mix of studying students, working professionals and a few friendly hangouts. A quick review of the menu will delight your taste buds; the carefully crafted coffee, cafe sandwiches, and teas will satisfy even the most selective consumers. We tried the caprese baguette and the Lonzetta panini; both were scrumptious! I was also very pleased with their ice coffee. I drank it black and it wasn't too bitter for me. My sister got a the Strawberry Jam-tea was substituted for the alcohol listed in the menu. It was recommended by the barista and while my sister liked it, she commented that it wouldn't be added to her cafe favorites.   Overall, we had a lovely experience at De Fur! I will be sure to venture back here on my next visit to Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Love this new coffee/ tea spot in the Strip! Located on Smallman, it's nice that it's a bit behind the chaos that is Penn Ave. I came here two weeks ago, around 3:45pm, without knowing that they close at 4:00pm. I ordered oolong tea, admired the art on the walls, and got comfy. I checked in on yelp and freaked out a little when I saw that they were closing in a few minutes. Vanessa, who owns the shop with her husband, was working and was SO incredibly kind when I asked her if I needed to leave, since they were closing. Since some other customers were in the shop talking and hanging out, Vanessa said it was fine for me to stay too, as it takes a while to break down all of the machines and clean them. How sweet is that? I was able to sip my delicious tea for 45 minutes and work on some school work and enjoy the calming ambiance of this gorgeous shop. I really appreciated that.  Not only is this a coffee/tea shop, but it's a little market! They have tons of local items like honey, bread, oils & vinegars, jams, salt, baked goods, and everything you would need to brew the perfect cup of tea or coffee at home. Not only that, but De Fer is planning on having cocktails and wine in the next upcoming months as well! Once that happens, the hours will be extended. What an awesome concept.   Truly a beautiful coffee shop, in a great location, with fantastic owners. Can't wait to come back.",

    "text": "Honestly, the best coffee shop in Pittsburgh right now, and what a difference from its predecessor 21st Coffee and their horrible customer service and awful ownership. Its rare to find a beautiful space, friendly staff/amazing customer service, delicious coffee and food, and an actual variety of options. Most of the places in the city  have fallen victim to offering only sweet pastries, The paninis here are top notch, I've never had a bad cup of coffee -- and how many places in PGH can you transition into a cocktail or local kombucha if you've been working all morning and can't handle anymore caffeine?   De Fer knows what the city needed, and they are doing it right! It's a shame of the construction outside at the moment that limits parking or a quick stop in for a coffee on-the-go, but trust me, its worth the walk around the block if you can't park right outside the door. I recommend De Fer to everyone I know, and have sworn off all my other usual spots in order spend my money at a place that deserves it. A+++++++",

My wife and I came with another couple after going to Orchard Hill Church in the strip district.   I ordered an 8 oz light roast coffee and we split the breakfast sandwich and the cranberry ginger smoothie. Everything here tastes so fresh, and for $7 it's hard to beat such a delicious breakfast sandwich. The pesto cream cheese was noticeable in it and my mouth kept coming back for more.  Loved going here for breakfast! It's a great little coffee place with very high quality food and at an affordable price.",

They really put a lot of effort into making sure each bean is perfectly roasted and each cup is perfectly brewed. I honestly didn't love the coffee samples that we tried (too acidic for me), but the staff were very clear in telling us that they were serving an acidic coffee, and I'm confident they could recommend a different variety next time I visit  I also love that they served salted chocolate chip cookies, which have recently become my favorite kind. Their food menu looks amazing, and I can't wait to come back and try other dishes  Another highlight is their wall of products, mostly from local Pittsburgh vendors. They had things like flavored honey and beer \"jam\", as well as a great selection of tea leaves  Friendly people, good food, good drinks (coffee and cocktails?!), well-decorated space, what's not to love?",

I am not a huge coffee drinker so I sampled their lavender tea and I have to say, that was one of the most refreshing iced teas I have ever had. I also tried some of their cheese selection and as a cheese lover I was really impressed.  The atmosphere is very welcoming and I could see myself taking my laptop there to get some work done.

It was such a thoughtful gesture as she could tell we were getting tired and very much appreciated. I will definitely be back!

I don't live in the city so this wouldn't be a daily stop to or from work, BUT, now that I've been I will definitely not be a stranger. In fact I plan on coming tomorrow for their seasonal peach waffles :)  Being a coffee drinker I completely appreciated the roasting tour as well the intro to the Chemex system in brewing coffee. Their selection of coffee is fantastic and they roast in House some of the finest beans available.  Not only is this a coffee house but they also serve a small but great selection of beers including brew on tap from a local brewery, which I do love a good beer, especially local. Why stop at beer when you can have wine and other select cocktails. This place delivers. Their baked goods and sandwich selection is impressive so don't feel this is just your simple Coffee joint. They have trivia night and are proud to display local artwork which gives this establishment that small city feel and makes you welcome like family. Kudos to Matt and his wife (I believe that's the owners name)  and the entire De Fer team. I don't rate 5 stars often but you delivered on all cylinders.",

You can tell the staff and the owners have poured everything into this shop and they truly put love into each cup of coffee, from choosing the beans to the roasting process, until it's brewed and ready to drink. Also, they have food and alcohol which makes it the perfect space for just about anything, from breakfast to lunch, to an after work drink, it seems like it could fit just about any occasion.   It's a very open space and seems like it could be a good space for studying but it also seems like a space for meeting up with people, so it may get a bit noisy at times. I'm very excited to come back and try more of their food and drink menu.",

I can honestly say that De Fer is an upgrade to what once was.  The interior design is open and inviting, with brick walls contrasted with brightly colored art and seating. There are flowers at each table and even a playroom for kids.  Not only do they sell espresso drinks, but they also sell baked goods, merch and other goods!  The baristas are very very very friendly, nice and super helpful! They were patient and non-judgmental of all my questions and curiosities. Frankly, this is rare among coffee shop culture.  The coffee was pretty good, though the espresso wasn't as deep or bitter as I personally would have liked but to each their own! The syrup, made on-site, is not too sweet but prominent enough.  Would definitely come here a gain!",

We got a few drinks which were good.  The atmosphere was very nice and kid friendly which for us is a big deal.  They even gave our kids a babycino, which the kids enjoyed.  Steamed milk with foam and some cocoa powder on top.  So the kids sat there and had their drink with us.  It was also nice because they have a little shelf full of kids books and even let us take one.  They also had a play kitchen that the kids had a good time playing with, with little coffee items.  This was a good find in the Strip district and well worth the stop!",

I'M OBSESSED.  That Vanilla Rose Iced Latte has forever changed the game and they offer oat milk. She keeps getting better and better. The staff here is so welcoming and I never wanted to leave.

It's packed with flavor and only takes a few minutes to prepared. While you're ordering you'll see the big display of desserts. Save it for your afternoon pick me up...

I was thoroughly excited to return as they left a remarkable impression during the event.   I love every concept this coffee shop has to offer. They create their own blends of coffee in house, offer a variety of fresh cocktails, wine, local beer and cider, (at a coffee shop?! who knew..), support local small businesses by selling their products, and provide a fresh and seasonal menu with a unique selection.   My husband and I decided to share the Breakfast Panini and a Cranberry Ginger Smoothie. The panini was filled with fresh eggs, cheese, pancetta, and a unique pesto dijon spread served on farmhouse bread. Everything about it screamed \"made from scratch!\". The smoothie was made from fresh cranberries, banana, orange juice, ginger and greek yogurt - it tasted as fresh as if I made it in my kitchen, with perfect consistency and beautiful color.   Not only does this shop offer sandwiches and smoothies, but they have quite a selection that will satisfy anyone: waffles, fresh breads/toast, meat and cheese platters, cereals, along with a display case full of baked items and salads. Their prices were very reasonable, especially for the quality that they served.   Finally, the staff. The owners remain actively involved from a consumer standpoint by waiting on customers and engaging in conversation. The rest of the staff are just as pleasant and eager to serve.   I would love to make this a regular stop when we head to the Strip for church, for shopping, or when biking downtown. This place is hard to beat!",

I have honestly been waiting for a spot like this to open where I could work by day or night and/or meet up in a chill space for a cocktail pre-dinner or for happy hour.   It took me a while to warm up though, I must admit. I wasn't really a fan of their chai, which is one of my top picks for a coffee bar drink. Admittedly, I'm just not a coffee person. I like a super spicy chai and theirs is milder. But I kept coming and ordering down the list of their teas and am happy with their own blend of early grey and love my afternoon non-caffeinated vanilla rooibos tea.   I also always get their baked oatmeal, which comes in bar form. You definitely want to get it with your morning (or afternoon) drink because it's so delicious when it's warmed up and has a scoop of greek yogurt and honey drizzled on top. But that's just the start of their breakfast menu, and offer a full range of all the faves.   But let's move on to the cocktails. They have a solid wine and beer list, as well as a couple different negroni variations, which are some of the best I've had around town. They've also recently expanded their cheese menu... If that doesn't sell you alone, I don't know what to do! Just go there and enjoy the atmosphere and a drink (alcoholic or non) and enjoy the lovely experience there!",

    "text": "Coffee, Cocktails, Wine, Beer, and artisanal local cheese and meats? What is this place? Heaven? I think so (especially if you grab a seat upstairs).  We were looking for a spot to take a break from our touring around Pittsburgh and wanted to get some drinks, coffee and maybe a snack before moving on. Most of our group got craft cocktails, and were very impressed with the quality and tastes.  My friend and I decided to be fancy and bought a bottle of wine and the 5x5 meat and cheese board (5 artisanal local cheeses and 5 cured meats, also locally sourced/made). Given our choices of meats and cheeses we asked their in house Sommelier to help us pick a bottle that would pair well. She recommended we go with the Cultivate Pinot Noir and wow! What an amazingly easy drinking, clean finishing wine, and when paired with the meat and cheese....well I could have just stayed there all day long.  Lots of main floor seating but we ended up in the loft space overlooking the rest of the venue, and it was a perfect spot!  Big fan of this place, I'd definitely come back for coffee and baked treats next time!  Eatcrest Out",

It's a cool lunch date spot or business meeting location. I buy coffee to take to my second home in N.Y. every time I'm there.  Pricy, but IMHO you can't go cheap on your make-up, hair, nails, or home brew coffee! Buy it!",

These owners quit corporate America to follow their dream of owning a coffee shop. How cool is that?  They are very personable & passionate about their products and seem to do anything it takes to make their customers happy.  The space is plenty big for a small acoustic performance, poetry slam night, trivia night, etc. and once it cools down enough to leave the front garage door rolled up, you'll get that fresh air feel in a cozy shop.    Give this place a try if you're looking for a cool, hip, chill place to hang out for a few hours...",

The space itself is spacious, gorgeous and roomy. The staff is very friendly, knowledgeable and welcoming. I liked learning about the process on how they roast their coffee beans.  Let's talk about the menu!! So extensive and enticing!! I can't wait to come back and try so many more of the menu items from waffles to paninis!! The wine I had at this particular event was very tasty and different. Cheers!! They also have a great selection of beers and cocktails that I look forward to trying more of on another visit.",

Are you detecting a pattern? De Fer does it all and does it all right! I've had their coffee, their tea, their paninis, desserts and waffles. Those waffles...wow! I do not like sweet things. These fit the bill. The homemade whipped cream was not at all sweet. A light touch of cinnamon, fruit and syrup made this a dish you will crave. I don't normally like coffee, but if I lived near De Fer, I would become addicted. They roast their own beans and offer various ways of creating a masterful cup of coffee. You will NOT be disappointed. Definitely a favorite of mine.",

With all the coffee shops popping up around Pittsburgh I have to say this was one of my favorites. This place truly has it all. Wine, cheese, food, coffee, etc. I ended up getting a specialty latte with a grilled cheese panini. Both were absolutely delicious!  The place itself can get pretty crowded so seating may be difficult on the weekends. Otherwise it was amazing. I look forward to giving it another try for a wine night.",

I always always ask if they do coffee art! I never expect amazing art, but just enjoy seeing it. I am not mad if they don't do it. This place made me my first cup of flat white with coffee art and it was nicely done! For my second cup, he redid it cause it didn't look good! Very very impressed! The coffee and cream waffle was great as well! They sure know how to make them picture worthy! It wasn't too sweet, but definitely fresh made! Didn't really taste the coffee in the waffle but I loved it.  Environment Seems to be a warehouse turned into a shop. There is a garage door that opens so a lot of wind and sunlight comes into the space. Decent amount of seating available.  Niceness of the staff I cannot express how nice these people were! I told them not too much cream on my waffle but still needed to look picture worthy and they did it! I asked for coffee art and they delivered! Love love the service I received! Very friendly and fun staff!   Dollar The items were relatively inexpensive I thought. The flat white was $4 and the waffles were less than $10 (I forgot the real price)   Yes? Absolutely love this place! Waffles and flat whites all day long! If I am ever in Pittsburg again...  #WendyWanders",
