    "text": "Noodles & Company is a restaurant I frequented when I lived in the DC area.  I'd heard the lines have been horrendous since it's opened, so decided to go there with a friend on a Saturday afternoon.  There were just a handful of patrons there and no line--Yay!  I ordered the Bankok Curry and my friend ordered the mac & cheese w/ meatballs.  We had just enough time to get our fountain drinks (lots of options and machine is Japanese-style and kind of fun) when our food arrived.  The server was pleasant and checked back with us a couple of times (also cleared away plates) which was a nice plus.  My dish was very good and although I ordered a \"regular\" it was on the small side for me.  However, it offered just the right amount of spice, the vegetables were fresh, and rice noodles perfectly cooked.  My friend reported that his mac & cheese was good (his portion was also a bit larger than mine, FYI) and looked like the cheese sauce looked like it was just the right consistency.  My dish, with a fountain drink (I opted not to get the shrimp on it), was about $7.50.  As far as lunch prices go for downtown, it's a hair more expensive than a fast-food choice like Wendy's, but more healthful.  If you have a heartier appetite you can opt for one of their trios.  I'll definitely go back!",

    "text": "I've been to the Noodle Company in Market Square a couple times for lunch this month, including last Monday.  It's one of those places where you order at the register, get your own table, they give you a number and bring you the food.  My experiences here have overall been fairly good  though the restaurant does get packed around lunch time. But, it's downtown. What do you expect?  Luckily, there was an open table for me and my companions both times I came this past month, but I recently learned that they've stopped in before and there were no open tables. On to what I like about it: The selection and combinations. And did I mention carbs,carbs, carbs.  You basically pick the way you want your pasta prepared and can choose a meat, shrimp or tofu to add.  The first time I had Japanese Pan Noodles with parmesan chicken- not the best flavor combination but I should have known better. Last Monday, I decided to play it a little safer and go with the Bangkok Curry with  plain Chicken.  This was a much better choice. My co-workers feel that the mac and cheese dishes are much better than teh asian dishes. In addition, the service has been fast, the dishes I ordered came out within 5-10 minutes.   They also have one of the new fountain drink machines where you can pretty much get any soft drink you can think of, including some flavors I haven't heard of before. Last time, I tried Diet Vanilla Coke just to try it.  It frankly wasn't very good but hey, next time I can try one of the other 200 flavor combinations. So, if you are headed to Noodles & Company for lunch I would suggest that if it's busy when you come in and there's an open table, send someone in the group to take the table and order for them.",

Here is my recap: - The entire dish was dry;  - The Noodles were overcooked and sticky: I can feel them, like a big rubber ball, sitting in my stomach; - The Tofu appeared to be deep-fried: it was an odd shade of brown and the texture resembled that of chewing gum; - There was no flavor to the dish other than that of the oil they used to saute the undercooked carrots and onions - lots-and-lots of onions; - And, where were my peanuts and cilantro?  This is not Thai, which is all about the balance of flavors and spices, salty, sweet and heat!  I am all about giving the benefit of the doubt, but have reservations about giving this place a second-shot: I would much rather risk the cockroaches at the Lemongrass Cafe and get my Pad Thai there... Eew!!!",

The Japanese Udon noodles were better, but since they're cooked on the grill, some were burnt black, and that's just not how I like my Udon. Plus, it was pretty expensive for a fast food cafe.

    "text": "My main purpose of this review is to specifically declare my dislike of the Wisconsin Mac & Cheese at Noodles & Company. If you actually like Mac & Cheese, stay away from this version. It is the blandest tasting Mac & Cheese I have ever eaten. It is little more than lightly buttered macoroni with some shredded cheddar cheese on top and no seasoning whats-so-ever. I find it hard to believe that people older than 8 would actually like this dish. It upsets me that they have this item on their menu, without a warning or description of how bland and dry it is.  I did get the Mac and Cheese with the additional meatballs, which were quite tasty, if not a little too salty. However, the extra salt was needed to make the Mac & Cheese edible.They state this is their number one seller but I don't beleive them. It is likely their most profitable item, considering I paid $8.00 for some buttered noodles and three small meatballs.   The Mac & Cheese is surprising to me, considering that the other dishes I have had in the past were reasonably good. I usually order the more Asian-inspired noodle dishes. I also believe they have good staff who serve many customers quickly and efficiently, especially considering how busy this location is at lunch.",

We ordered the same thing -  Indonesian Peanut Saute: Spicy peanut sauce and rice noodle stir-fry, broccoli, carrots, cabbage, Asian sprouts, cilantro, crushed peanuts and lime.  As in fresh lime wedged, served with your platter - i loved that added touch.  The dish itself tasted authentic, fresh, and flavorful.  It was studded with the steamed veggies that made the meal very hearty.  My only grip was the chicken (which you add separately to the bowl, they have other options such as tofu, shrimp, and beef - i think)  wasn't as flavorful as the noodles, as in it needed salt!  If this was a little bit better, I would have given noodles & co. a 5 star rating.  They serve all different types of noodle bowls + sandwiches.  Ranging from Asian to American flavors, so it will appease anybody's palate.  The decor is modern-chic.  The service was stellar, for what is basically a fast food joint.  You should definitely give this place a try - I loved it!",

There are so many good choices in the square, and Noodles and Company is a nice addition. It's basically a nice fast food place, like Moe's or Chipotle. They serve (or will serve) one basic and one premium kind of beer and wine by the bottle.  ($17). Along with salads and other sides, the noodle dishes are split among three categories: American (e.g., stroganoff, mac and cheese), Italian (e.g, pesto, penne rosa) and Asian (e.g., pad thai, japanese udon). You can add protein to the dish, as you want. The dishes can easily be made gluten free (rice noodles) and/or vegetarian. Small and large portions are available. They list a number of dishes that are 500 calories or less.  It's a great little lunch place, and I'm thrilled that it's joined the Market Square neighborhood.",

One word describes both dishes: BLAND.   Thai food should never be boring, and the curry lacked spice completely. The macaroni and cheese surprisingly lacked flavor for how many ingredients it contained. I ended up shaking some hot sauce over it.

The interior is smartly designed, open, and bright. I also couldn't get over how great the staff was, everyone was very friendly and seemed like they legitimately were in a good mood and wanted to share that with you.   I did the \"Pick 3\" deal where you get a small noodle bowl, a choice of protein, and soup or salad for $7.99. I ordered the Indonesian Noodle dish with spicy peanut sauce (really awesome, perfectly \"make your nose run\" spicy, and packed with fresh vegetables), I added beef, and the Tomato Basil soup (my favorite part of the meal). By the time I added a drink my bill came to just under $10. I can't wait to come back and try some of their other options, I saw a meatball sub that looked pretty excellent.",

We peeked at the menu and nutritional facts ahead of time so I was aware of what I was ordering before I got there.  We entered and there was no line.    We encountered a ver courteous cashier who explained how everything worked.  He took our order and we got a table.  The tables were clean but a little cramped together.  Our food was delivered timely and was pretty good.  Not the best thing I have had in Pittsburgh but it was A-OK!  The food was warm and fresh.  I had the Japanese Pan Noodles with beef.  We also ordered the Pot Stickers which were better than my meal.  I should mention that they have a wide variety of fountain drinks, including diet vanilla dr. pepper....YUMM!  There are employees that walk around and gather dishes and ask if there is anything else that you need.  I was shocked to discover when I got back that my meal had 620 calories and the beef was an additional 340 calories.  If you find the nutritional information online you must order the small portion, which was not given to me as an option.  The website provides a flowchart of what you can order to stay under 500 caloriess but you have to order the small portions.  I also found online that they do have the option to order a small meal, with a protein, and soup or salad.  I think that will be the best option for those that count calories.  I will probably go back there at some point but no rush on my end.  I will also need to pay alot more attention to the nutritional content upon ordering.",

After we looked at the menu for about 5 minutes, one of the employees came over and asked if she could answer any questions for us. She was very patient, knowledgeable, and helpful. We soon decided and approached the counter where you order. The cashier was personable and very nice. They had waitresses/busers that brought our food and helped with anything they could. They were very attentive and willing to help. They fixed my meal in a timely manner and were very polite. Very nice drink machine with immense amount of choices. They had a drink for everyone.   The areas that I felt were negative was the cashier was new and did not know the menu very well and rang up our drinks incorrectly. When my food came out(Japanese Pan Fried Noodles), the noodles and steak was burnt very badly. The food was not amazing. It was not awful but it was just below average. I feel like the menu was limited for a specialty restaurant. Although drinks were a positive, there were drinks you could not get because they were out. I do not know if this was due to Light Up night and they were unable to refill them or if they just had not done it. Pricing was not very good. Cafeteria style and uncomfortable chairs and tables(i prefer booths).  Some improvement would be a change in the atmosphere, seating upgrades, better food quality and selection, and have drinks on stock when needed.  I would not come here again because it does not really stand out among the other establishments in the same area. This restaurant is located in Market Square in downtown Pittsburgh, so there are multiple restaurants in the square and the only reason we chose this restaurant because we decided it was the most kid-friendly restaurant at which we had not already eaten.   *The most important improvement would be food quality because if the menu stayed the same and the food they had improved I would be willing to give it a second chance.",

    "text": "I saw the \"Coming Soon\" sign weeks ago and was rather excited since I am a carb-oholic by nature and anytime you say noodles my ears perk up and my salivary glands kick into gear.  Needless to say I have been waiting (anxiously) to try this place for a while and after reading all the reviews I was certainly looking forward.  Now that I have taken my last sip and chewed my last bite ... all I can say is MEH.  Let me start with the positives and then move on to the part that quickly turned what could have been a four or five star review into a \"I'll give you two stars this time and I hope you impress me next time\" review.  I walked in at 12:45pm and the place was packed, the line actually was out the door by about 4 people, which is considerable regarding it was late for lunch time (sorta).  Upon getting to the register there was no acknowledgement of it possibly being my first time, when I clearly had the deer in front of headlights look, but the gentleman who took my order was super nice and didn't rush me.  I ordered the Penne Rosa, with Parmessan Chicken, and a soft drink.  After taxes I think I paid $10.50 or so.  So service was fast, it was friendly, and it wasn't horribly expensive.  They do have a super fun touchscreen pop machine...but they were out of Coke Zero **heart break**  So why was it meh?  I was afraid the \"fast food\" aspect would dilute the flavor and that it did.  For the first time in my life I ate something that was both spicy and bland.  I didn't know if to reach for the glass of water or for the salt shaker.  I opted for the Diet Coke and called it even.  I did take it to-go so maybe that had something to do with it ... but for something to pack that much of a spicy punch (lips tingled but not quite beads of sweat) and still be like \"where's the actual flavor\" is rather unacceptable.  I do want to return.  And I want to actually do a sit-down meal instead of to-go.  Perhaps trying a different genre of dish or simply eating it fresh as opposed to after a cross-town trek will make for a better taste.  I do love pasta, so I'm not ready to write this place off.  Maybe next time it'll impress as much as I thought it would...heck, even if it just impresses period I'll take it.",

I was told to order online to avoid the RIDICULOUSLY long lunch hour lines & yes, ordering online was a breeze (The initial price of the noodle bowl isn't bad but add meat or tofu topping and you're quickly up to over $8.  Yet I was hopeful it would be worth it).  The restaurant:  LOUD (blasting music & loud customers in a place w a high, metal ceiling), cramped (tables sooo close together), jam-packed.    The food: Meh. I ordered the Japanese pan noodle dish with tofu.  They skimped on the tofu & vegetables but there were loads and loads of sticky, gummy soba-ish noodles.  The sauce was barely there and had been completely cooked on and into the noodles.  Not much flavor at all.  The only thing that made it edible was a heavy dose of sriracha sauce.   Maybe their fatty mac & cheese dishes are amazing but I certainly won't be back to try for $9 a bowl.",

    "text": "Let me first start off by saying that one of the reasons poor Noodles is only getting two stars from me is because of the hype.  I heard SO many good things about Noodles & Company from several different people that had eaten at their locations across the country, so I was really looking forward to a yummy, carb-loaded meal.  Unfortunately, the product definitely did not live up to the hype.  I ordered bacon cheeseburger mac and cheese (my mouth waters just by typing out those words).  I had visions of hot, creamy cheese sauce with moist hamburger and hunks of bacon dancing in my head.  Much to my dismay, the actual product was quite \"chain-y\".  To start, the whole dish came out room temperature.  The cheese sauce appeared to be white American and was just mehhh.  On top was a dry combination of hamburger meat, bacon (bits?), shredded cheddar, green onions, and diced tomatoes.  The tomatoes were the best part; it gave the dish some much needed acidic freshness.  I won't lie, I ate the entire thing.  But much like the cheese sauce, the entire dish was just very mehhhhh.  Something else too:  Despite the fact that they advertise as such, they don't have beer.  Yet?  I know the restaurant is relatively new and they may be waiting on a liquor license and such, but if you say you have beer both on your storefront AND on your menu, you better have a sign up alerting us to otherwise.  It was quite the \"wah wah wah wahhhhh\" moment.    But thankfully, my sadness from lack of beer was alleviated by their super fun pop machine!  Talk about high-tech good times.  They have one large machine and it's a touch screen.  Your main screen gives you your basic choices for pop, and then once you choice your brand it goes to ANOTHER screen that gives you all these additional options for flavor!  Did anyone else realize that Coke products come in nearly a dozen different flavors???  I mean, this was my first time here so I'm not sure if ALL of the options have that many flavor choices, but talk about a good time!  So my thoughts overall are:  If you need a meal on the quick side (30 minutes or less) and you don't want greasy fast food or Subway, than this is a totally acceptable destination.  It's quick (during non-peak hours), it's filling, and it does have a decent selection.  But otherwise, venture out somewhere else.  There are a dozen different places to eat just within Market Square itself!  Take your sit-down business elsewhere and leave this option for when you're in a time crunch.",

    "text": "My co-worker and I have seen construction going on in Noodle & Co's tidy corner of market square and were anxious to try it out.  I had the Pad Thai with Tofu and boy was it underwhelming. The noodles were covered in an almost sickeningly sweet \"chili\" sauce. There were few vegetables, mostly carrots, and no attempt at any sort of condiment (peanuts, vinegar, fish sauce, etc.) other than a few bean sprouts. The Sriracha was really what saved the dish. The tofu was barely warm and pretty chewy.  The menu, and items therein, seem to be developed to appeal to broad and bland american palate. There are around 20 noodle dishes in three different categories, \"Asian\", \"Mediterranean\", and \"American\" as well as 5 sandwich dishes.  Overall strikes me as a Panera Bread trying to piggy back on fresh concepts like Chipotle's success. Probably not the most fair assessment, but we were expecting a brothy Asian noodle hangout and this was far from that.  All that said, the prices are probably fair, especially affordable if you go sans meat/tofu although I would really appreciate an extra veggie option.",

I got the opportunity to try it out today although I figured I knew what to expect since franchises try to be consistent in quality and taste regardless of their location.    This is just how I remember it.  It's affordable, relatively quick, and tasty.  Please note the order b/c if you ask me are their better tasting places out there - sure.  Are there cheaper places our there - yes, and are their faster places out there - of course.  But to have the trifecta - well that does take a little more effort than having one or another of those qualities.    Which is why this place gets 4 stars - it probably helps that it's also close to where I work.",

    "text": "If you're jonesing for some noodles, head to Noodles & Company. This business is basically what it sounds like: it's a chain that specializes in serving multiple styles of noodle-based dishes. It has everything from spaghetti to pesto to plain old buttered noodles with meatballs. It also serves a couple soups as well and it looks like they're expanding and may be offering more sandwiches soon, too.  So yeah, if you like noodles and carbs, Noodles is the place to hit for a quick bite. It's not the fanciest food ever, but really, for what it is - a quick and relatively cheap lunch or dinner - it's just fine. Every time I've been here or any of its other locations, my friends and I have not been disappointed. The servers I've run into have always been nice and quick to correct any problems I've had with my meal.  Personally, I think this location may be my favorite. Out of all of the locations for this chain I've visited, this one (downtown) is the best; it's the biggest and has the most seating, it felt the most welcoming, and I wonder if the menu and drink options are a bit more varied than the ones at smaller places. It's been a while since I visited the alternate locations so I won't say this is a definitive, but at the very least, the downtown location gives the sense that it has more options, and that's a positive whether it's a feeling or a fact.  It does seem to have its off-days given the state of the other reviews, but hopefully you can catch the place on a good day!",

Today's excuse was a much-anticipated inaugural trip to Noodles & Company.  I ordered online with 7 other co-workers; which is a great feature their website and one you should DEFINITELY take advantage of no matter how small or large your group may be. Otherwise, get ready to WAIT. Seriously. The line was capital E - Epic and the atmosphere was chaotic to match.  I will say this - their online ordering system was down today, so the pick-up of our order was a little messy.  But the manager eventually made good on all of our orders, so I'm going to let it go.  Our selections ranged from my own Bangkok Curry to a couple of Pad Thais, a salad and a few Italian noodle dishes thrown in for good measure.  Out of 10, the highest rating my co-workers gave to their own respective dishes was 8 and the lowest 6; though after further thought I might change my 6 to a 5.  My Bangkok Curry was totally fine.  Fresh broccoli, well-cooked noodles, but lacking in spice. Just nothing special and now I smell like an onion.  Definitely not worth waiting in that insane line for (even though I didn't, as an online orderer), but worth it enough to pay $5 for.    I'd recommend going once, maybe twice to try another genre of noodle dish.  Beyond that, there are so many more local, interesting joints that serve noodles in this awesome city of ours.",

    "text": "This is my second trip to Noodles & Company, again during the lunch hour.  By now this establishmen is a couple months past the hype but it's only turned out so-so, three stars for me.  First, the girl who took my order was friendly, responsive, quick and attentive. After making up my mind, I got the Japanese Pan Noodles, however without protein, as the dosis of carbs fulfills more than the amount of calories I want to alot to lunch. Also, for being a fast food restaurant, a price of 10 dollars is pushing it. On that note, the pricing boards are not the clearest. You find yourself going back and forth between sections just to puzzle together how much you will be paying at the end. This all, no matter how fancy the a-la-carte coke vending machine is. My drink was a blend of strawberry-vanilla sprite zero. I love the fact that Pittsburgh has a trend of getting picked as a test or at least a first wave implementation city for new machines and products. (:-))  I was in line barely ten minutes before my order was filled, which was great, as I was in line behind about 15 people.   I must agree with another fellow yelp-ers review, because this dish was both blan and overspiced. It was overloaded with black pepper and the noodles were scorched from the pan frying process. The carrots, mushrooms and sprouts had no flavor, not even the sweeter sauce flavoring the dish came with. But boy, was there a parsley kick.   I was in an out within 30 minutes, and the place makes me want to come back only when I am craving my noodle comfort food.   I'm going to get technical for a second from a customer flow perspective, but the layout of the place sucks:   First, if you are dining in, the space is petit, laden with various size tables that may or may not be available at lunch time, including long cafeteria-like tables to accommodate more than 6 people, so if you're not at least willing to meet a new lunch companion for the day, you may be out of luck. Second, the common tables are triangular in nature to maximize space, so you may run out of room to set the bowls that are brought to you by a 'server'. This server is also responsible to clearing your dishes, to avoid spacial accomdation for waste bins. Third there is NO counter between the final food station and the customer. This makes we more than nuts because servers, food perparers, cashiers, food itself and customers are all within the same bubble. It may have been there for quick access, however it's turns into a crowd control/sanitation issue.  If you decide to take out, there is no space to accomdate you during your waiting time. If you get there during the big lunch rush, you may find yourself stepping on yourself or other people, including the 'servers' that are flowing back and forth. It's absolutely hopeless, but I don't know if there's much one can do about this.  The best advice to avoid this of course is to avoid the lunch hour, as downtown empties out after 4pm. When I pass the Noodle & Company place in the evening times, there is ample space for you to enjoy your fast noodle meal.",

I ordered the Wisconsin Mac & Cheese with parmesan chicken. it came out very hot and cooked well. the flavor was good but I was disappointed in that it was a tad runny and a majority of the noodles had no cheese/sauce on them. The chicken was great, nice crust and very tasty!   I will definitely try this again, but I will try something other than mac & cheese... which I should have donE in the first place.",

While a national chain, this place has speed most days at lunch within the ordering process.  I can't even imagine working here because so many people slam this place for lunch.  Dinner time is much more relaxed and there is always plenty of space to eat in.  I usually play it safe and order the macaroni and cheese.  It is exceptionally mild so I like to take it back to work and add some sriracha sauce to it.  The portion is good for lunch and a decent size for dinner, although I sometimes need just a little more.  They also have one of those cool soda machines where you can make a million flavors of soda.  While the food is national chain quality, this particular one is pretty fast in the lunch rush.",

The company must be cutting back on expenses, but that means they will be cutting customers as well. Need to buy a second lunch now.

It's not necessarily cheap and the serving sizes won't likely fill you up, so the appeal isn't always there for me, but it's not a bad option if you're craving some pasta. I love the pesto cavatappi (add grilled chicken), but I've never eaten it and walked away full, regardless of the size that I've ordered. You could leave full if you opted for the mac & cheese with parmesan chicken or something, but you'll pay the price in calories (they do have a sub-500 calorie menu, but those options rarely fill anyone up).  There's also the issue with the awkwardness that's associated with online ordering. It's awesome that you can order ahead and pay online...but it's kind of weird how that results in a bunch of people just standing around in the middle of the restaurant waiting for their name to be called.  Generally speaking, everything has been decent. Pad Thai lacks flavor, but otherwise, everything has been okay. Nothing will blow you away, but if you're in a crunch and want some carbs, Noodles & Company is worth trying.",

    "text": "I'm conflicted.  Half of me says \"Meh. I've experience better\" and half of me says \"a-okay.\"  Let me break this down for you....  When you have a flexible schedule and can travel anywhere in the city, pass this sucker by.  There's so many other fabulous non-chain restaurants in the Burgh to try out!  On the flip side, I understand working downtown sometimes the options get slim or stale.  Let's face it, downtown is only so big folks.  For a downtown office worker, this place is \"a-okey.\"    I tried the Japanese Pan Noodles.  I liked that I could order wheat noodles.  I liked that there was broccoli, carrots and sprouts in it.  That's where it ended.  It was kinda bland and forgettable.  Would it suffice for a fast lunchtime meal, yes.  What I was amazed by...the fancy schmancy pop machine.  It's completely digital and you're able to choose from every coke product imaginable.  When I picked coke zero, I was expecting the choice of, well, coke zero.  Instead, Not only was I able to get normal coke zero, I could get cherry vanilla, raspberry, lemon, lime and a couple other choices.  I assume they add syrup to those choices...but it was pretty cool.  I love when technology and food combine!  Heck, I'd come here JUST to grab a pop instead of 7-11.    There's supposed to be beer, which was advertised on the menu and on the front door, but it's not there yet.  I'd be interested to see what they carried because it looked like there's no tap, so I assume just bottles.  I'd like to see a fancy machine like the Coke machine with alcohol!  Wouldn't THAT be grand!?",

    "text": "We were both overall happy with our meals here. I got the zucchini truffle mac with zucchini noodles, cheese sauce, black truffle,  roasted mushrooms and parmesan cheese with breadcrumbs. While I liked it, I didn't find the zucchini noodles particularly filling like I would ordinary noodles and it didn't really resemble mac and cheese so much as zucchini with a tasty mushroom sauce. I tasted the parmesan more than anything as the sauce, while tasty, did not have a particularly strong flavor.  My generous partner also gave me almost half of his Pad Thai since I couldn't really feel full on the zucchini noodles. The Pad Thai consisted of rice noodles, egg, cabbage, peanuts, green onion and cilantro. Overall, I thought it was a decent take on it considering how difficult a dish Pad Thai is to make. It was not a \"thai restaurant\" quality but you can definitely tell it was Pad Thai and it still did fulfill that type of craving with the tangy tamarind and fresh ingredients.   This restaurant is one of the more affordable restaurants in Market Square downtown and they do cater to vegans, vegetarians and people who are gluten free which is nice. I also like that they offered the zucchini noodles despite them being less filling. They also have a comprehensive selection of beverages to choose from the beverage machine.",

If you are a total vegetarian or prefer gluten free, spell it out when placing the order and the dish will be altered to your taste buds.  I ordered the Pasta Fresca with half penne and half zucchini, which came out to our table pretty quickly and tasted yum. They also have soups and salad, and couple of cookies for dessert.   Its a place you can eat with no worries on calories because they seem to be counting it for you.  The 1 star reduced is because of the quantity of the food. While my friends' bowl was full, mine was only half the bowl ..... Still, will visit again for sure and maybe this time compare the quantity ...",

I've never actually eaten at a Noodles & Company so I wasn't sure what to expect.   It didn't start off great since our cashier/server had the personality of a wounded lion. I get it, it's not the greatest job in the world and you probably have to deal with a lot of annoying pains in the ass, but DON'T take it out on the next customer (in this case ME).   Luckily the food cane rather quickly. Wifey ordered the Spicy Korean Beef Noodles and I had the Thai Chicken Soup. Both were actually quite delicious. I think probably a little too much sesame oil in the noodles, but still delicious.   Very good late lunch, but the service and cleanliness left a little to be desired.",

A few weeks ago I noticed a sign that said you can replace any noodle in any dish with zoodles. It's amazing!!  I'm not used to having this many options, particularly in a place specializing in pasta. The pad Thai is great with zoodles, as are the spaghetti and meatballs, the pesto dish, and the montamore with chicken. I seriously come here every day now.   Advice to management: please don't get rid of the zoodles!!!    Advice to customers: do dine in if you can.  When I got takeout the one time, the portion was almost half as much as when I sit in the restaurant.  I checked my receipt to make sure I ordered the full size, and yep.

    "text": "Overall Impression: An \"okay\" noodle-ry for a quick lunch in Market Square that offers nothing to write home about--basically the Subway of Pasta. You're excited about it because you haven't had it in awhile, then you're sad after you eat it.  The Food: This food just doesn't do it for me. It doesn't hit my Italian cravings or my Thai cravings. It always falls extremely short of my expectations, mainly because they label themselves as niche-style noodle place. When a restaurant wants to be known for something very specific I generally think it will be above average--but I was wrong. Even though their dishes LOOK good, they are generally bland and lack any depth of flavor even though they market them as very diverse flavors (Asian, Italian, southern, etc.). My usual go-to here is the small-portion Pad Thai + protein (I picked sauteed shrimp). The rice noodles stuck together and were lacking sauce. The dish was mostly noodle with little toppings-- the scrambled eggs, cabbages, Asian sprouts, and green onions were all scarce. I had 4 pieces of *sauteed* shrimp that didn't taste sauteed at all, they were very chewy and dry. The Thai Chicken Soup saved the day flavor-wise (coconut curry is hard to mess up) but was missing something very important--the chicken. I scooped my spoon through it and didn't find one hint of protein, just the lemongrass, online, cabbage, and carrots, and pepper. They must have ladled it from the top. Besides the obvious lack of quality in the food, the team there has extreme difficultly adhering to special dietary needs. You'll see this backed up in other reviews here and I've seen personally where they just miss the bar. You'll clearly omit something in an order and because they're moving so quickly they stop paying attention to the little add-ons. My coworker doesn't eat meat or dairy and they've wrecked her order every time we've gone--so it's definitely not the place if you need a special version of something. They just get into this mode where they stop reading the tickets the entire way.  The Restaurant: I went to college downtown, and I've visited this place at least 10 times within that timeframe. I remember their menu being more robust and diverse; since then they have tapered down on the amount of noodle options and other dishes. I specifically remember a spicy chicken caesar wrap that's no longer available, and I thought that was better than the majority of their noodle dishes. The best thing about this location is there dedication to quick service. I placed an order online from my office and could pick it up 8 minutes later. I arrived at the location, walked into the dining room, and they had all mobile orders waiting on a shelf with your tag and ticket. You literally have to speak to no one--you just walk in, grab your bag (and check it because of how often they screw up), and go! It's one of the most hassle-free online pickups I've done down here next to Moe's Southwest Grill. Even though they have an iffy reputation, the place is usually packed, and the tables frequently in need of cleaning, which doesn't happen as often as it should. I would highly recommend the online order to take back to the office instead, as it's much quicker. The staff is neither unfriendly or friendly, just hyper-focused on filling bag after bag. I did have all of my eating utensils and napkins, but still check your bag before you leave.  TL;DR: This place is great if you're in a pinch because of their fast service, but I honestly don't know why I keep going here expecting something different or better with their food, because I end my meal disappointed every. single. time. There's better fish in the sea of Market Square.",
