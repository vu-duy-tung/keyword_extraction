    "text": "As a former employee of Mad Mex Robinson, and a current regular at Mad Mex ShadySide, it kind of pains me a little bit to re-review and give them 3 stars - but in reality, it's a 2.5.  But now that they're almost a full year in - the shining example they displayed with great food and service during their opening month, has dwindled severely.  The reason for the re-view and severe star-docking?  Their consistency in food quality and service is non-existent at this location.  Jordan and I walk over there at least once-twice a week when we don't want to cook, and we have discovered that the only good time to go and get awesome food, is a busy Saturday night, because that's when the best line cooks and servers are scheduled to work.  If we go on a not-so-busy afternoon or weekday evening, our food sucks, and the service is even worse.  And ordering To Go isn't really a time-saver since the Bartender will ignore you.  I will leave out server and bartender names, just to be polite, but MULTIPLE servers (and I mean MULTIPLE) here, are just the worst in the city.  They're forgetful, slow, and always diffusing responsibility to a faceless kitchen.  On those days that we would go in the afternoon, every server on the floor is still visibly drunk and/or high from the night before, and audibly bragging about it.  Not that I care that people are drunk and/or high - but just be sure you can still function at a basic human level if those are your life choices.    My favorite things on the menu are the Angry Hippie Burrito, Foo-Foo Fajitas, and the Tofu Tacos.  Now when we go on a Saturday night - these plates are BANGIN' and totally delicious.  I crave the Tofu Tacos because they're so unique and so filling - whatever that glaze is on the tofu - I can't recreate it at home, unfortunately (and we have TRIED!).  I have to go to Mad Mad to enjoy my Tofu Taco craving.  The Angry Hippie Burrito is freaking awesome too, because it's enormous and there's tons of veggie goodness in it (if it's not overly dominated by black beans).  The Foo-Foo Fajitas - portobello and tofu and a party of other veggies (zucchini, corn, onions, peppers) - just makes love to your face once the skillet passes in front of you.    Though the wait times are long on weekends, you will mostly likely have a better food and service experience.  I promise.",

    "text": "On a Thursday evening, 4 of us were sat in about 30 mins. Not bad but in Shadyside. We found free street parking about 1 block down. The server greeted us in about 5 minutes, already bringing enough waters for everyone, which was awesome after a wait. To add, the interior decor was very cool and interesting. Great for date night or wanting to show new people the city. We ordered our food and then about 5 mins later ordered our drinks. The food came out pretty fast along with our drinks when the server asked if we needed anything else with our meals. I forget his name(I hate that!!) but next time I'll figure I out. My BF Got the got the Goblerita which is a corn, black bean mashed potato, turkey(Thanksgiving)  in a wrap. ORDER THAT. I ordered the taco salad which a little soggy halfway through when my burger meats juices soaked in but none the less the juices were delish. The bill was actually decent for a two drinks and entrees. So I leave this review saying please visit Mad Mex!!",

This is not that kind of Mexican food if you are looking at authentic, no kidding Mexican or even Tex-Mex food.  This would be more mid-Western tries to make Mexican food so understand what you are getting yourself into when you come here.  Knowing this, the drinks weren't bad, a lot of liberties with the alcohol, the food was given in large quantities, and they have vegan options.  The dipping sauce options and guacamole for the chips are actually pretty good (not really spicy though so don't expect that).  I had the chicken mole dish, and again, I should have known it wasn't going to be like the mole sauce I'm use to eating in southern CA or San Antonio, TX but the quantity of food was large.  Fun atmosphere, great kids menu and coloring books to keep them busy, and a great server for the 6 adults and 1 child in our group.",

San Francisco Wild is my go to. It is a little sweet with a very nice heat kick. Their house margaritas are pretty good with many flavors if you choose. They can be on the rocks or frozen. I usually do the Big Azz one which I think is 22oz, regular, on the rocks, with no salt. They also have some signature ones which are a little pricier. They are made with fresh juices. The V.I.P. is my favorite. The wingorito's are also great. you get a very big burrito for the price. The menu caters to everyone and is very whimsical. The atmosphere is always great, with dim lights, cool art work, and nice music. It is a hip spot for food and drinks. They have so much Tequila so you can get a Margarita however you want. Just Ask!",

It's convenient, there's street parking, it's a fun atmosphere, it's not impossible to get a table, and they have a decent happy hour!  What is there to complain about??  I can't speak to the food because I basically refuse to eat mexican food outside of CA or Texas.  (And yes, I know that Tex-Mex is fake mexican food.)  So, I'll defer to the rest of the yelpers for opinions on the food.  But given that there are several locations, I'm sure the food is your run-of-the-mill chain mexican options.",

    "text": "So I don't know if anyone reading this uses Mint to manage finances, but basically there is this option where you can view total spending over the past few years by specific store/restaurant/etc. One day I did a search for Mad Mex, and the number that appeared was absolutely horrifying.  So I'm at this Mad Mex a lot. Too much, maybe. It's just so conveniently located, the happy hour is good, food is consistent, and most of the staff is very friendly. My history with Mad Mex started at the Oakland location while I was a Pitt undergrad, and once I moved to Point Breeze on the very edge of Shadyside, I was glad that this new location opened within walking distance. The location itself is WAY better than the Oakland restaurant. It's so much bigger, has a cool garage door, and a very large bar.  The margaritas. Okay, so they're not the best margaritas ever--not even close, really. But the BIg Azz margs are HUGE and are cheap during happy hour. My friends and I actually calculated that getting two Little Butt margaritas at happy hour pricing is a better value that one Big Azz. Two Little Butts will cost $6 for 24 total ounces, while a Big Azz is $7 for 22oz. Knowledge is power.  I usually stick to the Wing-O-Rito which combines two of my favorite foods: buffalo chicken inside of a burrito. The standard rice, black beans, and cheese are also inside, along with salsa and ranch or bleu cheese on the side. I find it really hard to deviate from this even though I'm sure there are probably many other tasty things on the menu.  One other food item I do love is the Pennsyltucky Fried Tofu. Try it. Even tofu haters will like it.  True story: one time my friends and I won a 20lb box of coconuts and bananas here (plus a round of free drinks). You just can't say that about most restaurants.",

The Shadyside location is spacious and comfortable.  I love their black bean dip (and, accordingly, the black bean and pineapple quesadilla).  Much of the other food I've had here is pretty Meh and definitely \"Mexican inspired\" rather than close to anything authentic (or even authentically Tex-Mex-y).  The chips and salsa make me downright hostile because a) they are expensive, b) the texture is too thick and they taste as they came directly out of a supermarket-bought Tostitos bag, and c) they are often somewhat stale, so it's more like that Tostitos bag was bought and left open 2 weeks ago. Gross.    The Gobblerito is, indeed, a thing of Seasonal Beauty.  If you don't mind the resulting carb-coma, it is definitely something to try.",

I have always felt the service to be sub-par and the food to be just not good. HOWEVER, this time I came for the Gobblerito.  I think it goes without saying that the food was good. The Gobblerito really is a delicious item. The gravy is good, the turkey meat quality is good, the ingredients aren't soggy or disgusting. It really is a quality thanksgiving meal.  Also, this time, our waitress was actually really great! We were having really absurd hilarious conversations, and she finally walked by and mentioned that she thought we were hilarious. She also accurately gave us all our orders (easy, cuz they were all Gobbleritos, but we did have some modifications). Alcohol service was also quick. And she really was quite pleasant and didn't even bat an eyelash when we asked to split our check 6 ways (which, we know is a pain, and so we all tipped her extra well).  So, all in all, my last trip to Mad Mex in Shadyside was a great experience even though I usually find it obnoxious there.",

The food they serve is American Mexican food that often has interesting elements to it. It is more fresh and up-scale than the American style Mexican restaurants some of us may be used to. Also a bit more pricey, but price-wise I find it pretty reasonable. 10 to 15 or so for an entree. Drinks are fairly pricey, but not in context of the area.   The dining area is large and crowded at times. As someone who has lived in the area my whole life, I fell in love with the oakland location of Mad Mex in high school. I was excited when this location was opening and happy for them having more and more locations. Comparatively this location is a lot bigger but slightly less endearingly funky.   There is sidewalk seating and garage style doors in front, which are nice. Service varies, but is generally pretty good. They have student half price menu items in the early afternoons Monday through Thursday.",

    "text": "As a Texan and an avid Tex-Mex lover, I was quite skeptical to come eat Mexican, let alone, Tex-Mex in Pittsburgh of all places. I came here for brunch with my BFF who has just moved to Pittsburgh. Knowing I might be disappointed in Mexican food up here, I was excited to get a wonderful brunch menu item. I chose the chicken and waffles, while the BFF chose a burrito. We also got a trio of guacamole, queso, and a salsa to start.  My chicken and waffles were off the chain amazing. The chicken was boneless and fried and tossed in a delicious spicy sauce. It was served with some agave nectar as well as some cream cheese concoction for dipping. Oh my goodness, it was just so amazing. The spiciness combined with the sweet creaminess of the cream cheese was just out of this world. I devoured my meal.  Now the BFF's burrito was not as good, sadly. To call it a burrito is even a bad choice of words. It was a moist, soggy tortilla that was not rolled in burrito form but simply wrapped around a large mound of mostly rice. It would have been great and probably more tasty if there was HALF of the rice. It was just silly how big it was and the rice distracted from the other ingredients.   As I looked around, I saw a few other pairs of diners in which one got chicken and waffles, and the other got a burrito. It was so sad really, because mine was so good and I kept talking about how good it was and her's was just mehhhh...   All in all - fabulous brunch, lame burritos. Go try the chicken and waffles NOW!",

The staff is always FRIENDLY, unlike Oakland, the food is just as good (if not better), and I don't think I've ever waited more than five minutes for a table here.  I've been here at least a dozen times since moving back to Pittsburgh, and it's now what comes to mind when I think \"Mad Mex\". I've had plenty of meetups with friends, nights out with my girlfriend, and even a small, informal High School reunion at this location, and have never been disappointed by the food or the service.  The only issue is the parking situation, which isn't Mad Mex's problem, but it's worth mentioning. The plaza up the street (which houses Chipotle, etc) used to allow it after all of the businesses closed, but now they have a group of security guards harassing people and threatening to tow cars all night, despite their empty lot. I ended up having to park about a half-mile away the other night. This was infuriating, considering the hundreds of empty spots right next to the restaurant.",

The food runner told the dropped out food off and was too busy to answer the wifi password or to grab ketchup for the fries we had ordered.  All and all this is a great restaurant with great beer and food. The management should have a chat with their crew regarding customer service though.",

We ordered takeout from this location last week and the food was great!   I ordered the Chicken Fajita Burrito which consisted of chicken, beans, rice, lettuce, tomato, peppers and sour cream. Yum! It wasn't anything that made me go crazy,, but consistent to what I'd imagined. What left me most impressed, however, was the size of the burrito. It was freakin' huge! It pretty much took up the entire take-out container. For $10, I thought they could have thrown in some chips or something, but all in all, a great meal!   They do a great job at packing their take-out orders as well. Everything was neat and situated well with no room for any spills or accidents. They even pack things like lettuce, tomato and cheese separately for things like tacos so you can put on as much as you'd like.   Good service and good food. It was must first time eating from Mad Mex in years and I'll definitely return after my last visit.",

This past weekend I was there for a bachelorette with a party of 9 and our waitress was very good....staying on top of what we needed and allowing us to get all separate checks while shuffling a few things around (apps and the bride's dinner).   The guacamole is super delicious, but I think It's overpriced (I actually find a lot of the entrees to be overpriced but I know they use quality ingredients). The app is $7 for a small bowl (though it comes with unlimited chips and a small bowl of salsa as well). What can I say, I like a lot of guac on my chips.   The tortilla soup is DELICIOUS and is a good choice if you're trying to be calorie conscious. I usually sub it for a side...it's an upcharge though.   I usually get the steak quesadilla. It's plenty of food and I like that you have the option of a whole wheat tortilla. No matter what I get, I typically always have leftovers to take home.   Happy hour is also good with half off drafts and specials on margaritas and wings. It gets crowded after work so arrive early if you don't want to wait for a table.",

    "text": "How about a special holiday update on this place.  As you can see they have redeemed their self, at least a little bit with my most recent visit.  I was craving a Gobblerito, and this being the closest location to where I live, I begrudgingly came here.  I am happy to report, I survived and I was left with a better taste in my mouth (now, was that pun intended?).  I am not sure if it was where we were seated this time (I requested the booth), the server (so much more attentive, she heard everything we said), or if it were the overall experience that made this time so much better.  We started with the obligatory chips and salsa.  I also ordered a draft.  What I thought was going to start a downhill slip started with this draft.  The one I ordered just happened to kick the keg halfway filling up the glass.  Our server, Caitlin was her name, assured me that they were checking to see if they had another keg, if they did not, she would be back to ask if I wanted anything else.  I was thinking to myself, \"great, here we go again,\" however, she returned with a full glass of my draft, with that, we were over our little hiccup for the evening (another pun).  Everything came out perfect after that.  My Gobblerito was amazing.  Who can argue with Thanksgiving food being stuffed inside a burrito and topped with gravy?  Three good slices of turkey, a serving of stuffing, a serving of mashed potatoes with black beans and some corn stuffed oh so lovingly into a huge burrito.  Top it with a hot serving of gravy, a side of cranberry sauce stuff, and you have your Thanksgiving early.    My friends, I must warn y'all, This is a limited time item on their menu.  As I write this, I believe you only are able to get it for the next two days.  So RUN, don't walk to your nearest Mad Mex and enjoy this delectable item while you can!",

I could have finished the whole thing, but then I would have been miserable (if you leave Mad Mex hungry, that's on you). I got my leftovers to go, and then had them for dinner later that night. After a few hours and cold the burrito still help up. The tortilla wasn't at all soggy and the flavor was still on point.    The Shadyside location is by far my favorite, when they have the front windows open, even in the fall it's just a great place to meet up for a casual meal.",

I also recently tried the pulled pork BBQ burrito, which didn't disappoint! They definitely don't skimp on the meat here.  Also, a lot of the burritos they serve are often big enough to feed a family of three.  The best part? The $7 Big Azz (22 oz!) margaritas from 10 p.m. to midnight everyday, of course.

    "text": "Overview: Mad Mex is a popular, dimly lit, trendy Mexican restaurant/bar on S Highland Ave pretty close to the plaza with Chipotle/Whole Foods that I visited as a part of a large group for a pre-interview dinner.  The Food: Perhaps I am not the best person to talk about the food here because we did not have a traditional meal here. We were served buffet, BYOT (build-your-own-taco) style, and given a standard array of chicken, lettuce, salsas, and soft tortillas. We were served on their second story dining table which is basically a indoor balcony that seats a little over 20 people. I didn't find the food to be very special in any way, and thought the open room wasn't the best place for people to talk due to noise from the bottom stories.  The Establishment: Situated on a row of shops rather than in a plaza, I'm not exactly sure where people park. When I came here, I ended up parking in the Whole Foods plaza which was about a quarter mile away. It's very dimly lit, and fairly loud, but was upscale in that most of the furniture was good heavy wood and the bathrooms were classy and clean. There is a large bar to your left as you enter that I did not try out.  The Service: I can't really comment as I came with a large private group. After our initial drink orders, I didn't meet a waiter again.  Conclusions: Mad Mex was a decent restaurant for our large group (~20 people) but unfortunately I was not impressed by the food. I do have to warn readers that my experience was likely marred because buffet-style food has to appeal to the broadest audience and I do favor adventurous places that take chances with their cooking. Mad Mex has a trendy vibe that will appeal to most young people and seems well suited for small groups of young adults.",

I appreciate that they have a significant craft beer line up which goes far beyond the window dressing list a lot of places that try to carry craft beer put out.  Today I am drinking Founder's Kentucky Breakfast Stout... It doesn't get much better than that... But wait it does... Happy hour from 4:30 to 6:30 all draft beer is half off!!! Yatzee!  Other drink options include an extensive list of margaritas and some nice cocktails as well.  Wine list is limited but acceptable.  Big Azz margaritas (22 oz) are seven bucks from 10 till midnight every night.  The food here is good and meets expectations as far as texmex goes.  I've tried the fajitas and a few of the burritos and have always been satisfied though never blown away.  The ambiance is definitely modern, trendy, and more fashionable than your average Shadyside joint, Although, in a non-upscale, unpretentious sort of way.  There is very limited outdoor seating, but garage doors at front do open up to let fresh air in.",

I don't think this place takes reservations- but we were still seated within 30 minutes of arriving- not too shabby. Drinks were good and cheap, (because we were there during happy hour.)

I like hanging out at Mad Mex, but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice for a solid Mexican meal.  The service is solid, but the actual food quality is merely good.  I've been here on two different occasions and have tried both the Hippie Burrito and the Veggie Enchiladas.  Both dishes are decent, but are really nothing memorable.  The bar on the other hand, is really cool.  A great place to catch a game if you're in the neighborhood.",

They had a very good menu with alot of options. When the food came out it looked very good. I ordered the enchiladas and may girlfriend got the fajitas burritos. The dishes were not served warm and were very bland. The enchiladas had chunks of chicken that were hard to eat. it would have been better of the meat was shredded. The fajitas burrito had large pieces of meat and the steak was very chewy. The burrito was not well mixed, the one side had cheese and rice and the other side had the meat. Overall the restaurant had a good atmosphere and presentation, but the food needs work.",

It's usually hard to get on a nice day, but if you're willing and have the time to wait, I think it's worth it! It's a pretty noisy place, so be willing to talk over clanging glass, other loud voices and TVs to be heard, but it's a fun place to go with a group. I'm a vegetarian so I love the Happy Hippy quesadilla. Never disappoints. Lots of veggies, perfect amount of cheese.

Faux mexican food is not something I tolerate well and after trying to like the food at Mad Mex it was always a big fail for me. Chips and Salsa are about all I can handle here. IMO the food has way too many chillis in the sauces so there is a lack of seasoning because all I can taste is the heat. I am a big fan of spicy food but this is different.  Location, location, location! This place was filled to the brim with the Shadyside crowd! Highland ave has all sorts of little furniture stores and an art gallery to window shop at while walking up.   Luckily I had already eaten before so I wasn't hungry. Just because the food doesn't do it for me, that doesn't mean they can't get me in the door with their Giant margaritas and Happy hour specials! Blue salt and a little too sweet but oh so refreshing after a long day!  I asked the bartender if it was always so busy and she said since they opened they are \"slammed\" every night. Stupendous people watching!   The best part about this new spot is that it will have a rooftop deck! I'm so excited and so close to my house! My group will be regulars, I can guarantee. I bet Cinco de Mayo will be a crazy time! Viva la Vida!",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about Mad Mex.  I get really excited about going there, but the food always falls a notch short of my expectations.  But then, a few weeks or months later, I make plans to go back and I get all pumped up about it....and then the food is mediocre.  I guess I just have selective memory about Mad Mex - all I remember is the fun atmosphere and the chance to have margaritas with friends, and I block out the disappointing food.  Yesterday was my first time at this Mad Mex.  It was during the crazy heat wave, and I went with a big group of girls around 6 pm for Happy Hour.  And....the power was out.  Not on the whole block, just at Mad Mex.  Maybe their AC was cranked up so high they blew a fuse?  One of the girls in our group said this actually happened the last time she was at this location - in May - so apparently it's more than a one-time thing.  Lots of people were leaving, since the power was out, but we actually decided to go ahead and get a table since there was no wait!  I guarantee you there would be a wait normally, but if you are lucky enough to go when there's a power outage, you get seated immediately!  The big windows provided enough light to see, and it was a bit humid in there but not too bad.  The bar was still open, so we got margaritas ($7 for a \"Big Azz\" 22 oz) and chips and salsa.  The margarita was really tasty, but not strong at all.  If I'm getting a 22 oz margarita, I want to feel tipsy - especially on an empty stomach - but I barely got a buzz with this one.  Boo!  Maybe their tequila bottle runs on electricity and was experiencing the power shortage too.  The chips and dips were great, though.  Yummy, fresh guacamole....and the pineapple-habanero salsa was DELISH.  I could eat that all day.  It was sort of thin, with a soupy consistency, but my goodness was it yummy.  Sweet and fruity, with a huge spice kick!  I will definitely get that next time, because who am I kidding - I'll be back again, I'm sure.  After about 45 minutes, the lights came back on!  Yaaaaaay!  So we got to order food.  I was pretty full on chips, so I just got a bowl of chickpea chili.  It was okay....really not that great.  It was super thin, and salty, with some chickpeas and cheese floating around in it.  It wasn't very strongly flavored, not very gourmet, not very special.  It was okay to dip chips in, but it was nothing I'd bother ordering again.  I just got it because it's one of the only things on the menu that doesn't have like, a thousand calories.  I'm really not a calorie-counter usually, but I try not to eat my entire days worth of calories in one sitting, if I can help it.  The atmosphere is fun, a little noisy, but you can hear your friends.  I love the big windows, and this location is much more light and spacious than the evil Oakland location.  I think though, this place is not worth the hype.  With the decor and the crowds, you think \"I'm having fun!\"  But if you stop for a minute and notice what you're actually eating or drinking, you realize that it's okay, but not really worth the excitement.  But the spirit of the place is kind of addicting - seriously, if somebody asked me to go back tomorrow, I'd totally do it.  They've got a hold on me!",

    "text": "I love, love, love Mad Mex and I've been to this location as well as the Oakland, Greentree, McKnight, and Monroeville locations. They always consistently deliver me delicious food. Albeit, I ALWAYS get the same thing. I'm a big fan of the wingo-rrito or the wing (boneless) wrap. And I always get the Southwestern sauce, if you don't like cilantro, then don't get this sauce. Yummy!   As an appetizer, I enjoy the picka-dippa especially with a group of people. I'm a big fan of the black bean dip, the XX cheese dip and then not really picky about the 3rd choice for the dip.   Of course you can't go to MadMex without indulging in a margarita. This time around I tried the Apple Cider margarita which I thought was tasty, but not as tasty as my usual choice Mango. The Apple Cider margarita did taste sorta like apple sauce, but cinnamony apple sauce with a bit of a kick aka tequila.   The Shades Mad Mex is always busy no matter when I go, but at least it's more spacious then the Oakland and McKnight locations.",

My boyfriend suggested stopping here because he wanted a good beer.  I got the chicken chopped salad and was blown away!  I think it mainly had to do with the lime-cilantro dressing.  It was pretty much like cilantro pesto and totally made the dish.  It had a little kick to it, which I liked too.  We also ordered a guac and salsa side.  Both were awesome and very fresh.  I'll be back not only for the drinks but now for the salads, too!",

There was a good selection of beers on tap and even woodchuck hard cider in a bottle.  We got the grilled fish tacos and the Thai burrito.  Both were tasty and well done.  Portions were really very large.  The appetizer of pick three salsas with chips was a good experience.  The habenero pineapple salsa was appropriately spicy and the black bean dip was great (couldn't stop eating it), the guac was excellent too I was told (I can't stand avocados).

    "text": "I've been to the Oakland Mad Mex many a time in my wall-sittin' youth. Anyone who knows me even a little knows my unabashed love for all food Mexican.  This morning my bf and I awaited 11am like kids waiting for Gift-mas morning. Promptly at 11am we started our brisk walk from Bloomfield to the new(er) Shadyside Mad Mex.   The day twas lovely and once I saw that cactus shaped cigarette depository and those big ominous doors I knew I had arrived at Mexican food brunch heaven.  Walking in it is HUGE compared to at least the Oakland location. There are some seriously beautiful paintings and a really eye catching mural. The ceilings are high and the front is windows to allow some natural light in too.  Our waiter came immediately over to our table after our equally attentive hostess sat us. He was a little over the top, but likable and funny. We had our chips and salsa/guac and Big Azz margarita's on the rocks by the time I came back from the restroom and our long awaited Gobbleritos not long after.  I realize we were there at 11:30am on a Sunday morning so we're in a near empty restaurant at the start of everyone's shift, but honestly that's how I roll. I like trying something new when I won't be annoyed by the other patrons.  The drinks weren't quite as strong as I remember them being, but the Gobblerito's were delicious and I took half of mine home. My only real issue with the food was that while the salsa was so chunky and dense, the chips were absolutely not strong enough to dig any out. They were fine with the guac but would just break apart in the salsa.   Honestly, if that's the only bad thing, then this place is winning for sure. I can't wait to stop back and try something else.",

We came in at 11pm, at the right time for both of those offers. We ordered the sangria infused margarita (twice), boneless chicken wings and nachos. The nachos were alright, but when the cheese isn't liquid-like, I prefer that the shredded cheese be in obnoxious amounts. And that did not happen, even though I ordered extra cheese just in case.   The spicy boneless wings were not spicy, and could have used more sauce. The shape was also really strange, almost looked like a tiny tilapia fillet. I guess I was expecting more of a nugget, BWW typed wing, but it was fine either way. For $22, I can't complain. We left tipsy and full at 1am. Thanks Mad Mex!",

    "text": "I remember coming to Mad Mex consistently as a kid, but I recently came here with a date when he could not believe that I hadn't been to a Mad Mex in years.   It is just as good as my childhood memories made me believe it was.  I played it safe and got the Mad Mex Burrito with shrimp ($9.50).  What I love about Mad Mex is that they don't charge different amounts for shrimp versus chicken.  I am not a huge meat eater so this makes it worth the slightly higher price tag for me.  The burrito is packed with rice, black beans, and cheese, and the size is huge.  I love the square pocket shape with the super soft tortillas.  The salsa and lettuce on the outside was a bit unappetizing looking so I avoided it.  The chips and salsa ($3.75) we ordered at the beginning had much better salsa.  While we did not come during happy hour, I did get a small strawberry margarita.  It was one of the best flavored margaritas I have had, and the price was reasonable.  The happy hour specials are killer, though, if you want a drink.  The atmosphere is really loud, especially if you are on the floor.  The balcony area is quieter, but if you are coming to watch a game on TV, make sure to sit on the floor since you cannot see the TVs from the balcony.  The service is nothing more than adequate, but it is fine for a relaxed dinner.  Overall, I am ready to reincorporate Mad Mex into my life.",

    "text": "Given the fact that I absolutely love Mexican food, I can't believe I lived in Pittsburgh for almost two years before finally making my way to a Mad Mex! I came to the Shadyside location on Saturday evening with three friends. It was packed, but surprisingly the hostess was able to seat us right away.  One of the first things I noticed is that the restaurant is extremely dark - obviously in an endeavor to set the mood, but I would have liked just a little more light. We were seated by a window, however, which helped. If you're coming to Mad Mex expecting traditional Mexican food, you'll be disappointed. The food here is highly Americanized, so you just have to know that and accept it going into things. We started off by ordering some chips, salsa, and guacamole for the table. The salsa was a bit too spicy for my liking, so unfortunately I didn't eat much at all. The guacamole was actually better than expected, and I noted that the chips were piping hot and fresh when they came to the table. Service was quick, and despite the fact that our waitress had many tables, she did give us a decent amount of attention.   I ordered the chicken fajita burrito, which includes all the traditional components of the regular burrito (chicken, rice, black beans, and lettuce) while also adding in sauteed onions and peppers. The burrito was absolutely huge. This is the first burrito I've ever eaten that I was simply not able to pick up and was forced to eat with a knife and fork. It was like a brick! For ten dollars it was a great deal, as I took half of it home with me. The flavors were good, but honestly didn't wow me.   I hate to say it, but if I want Americanized Mexican food, I think nine times out of ten I would head to Chipotle over Mad Mex. That being said, I still enjoyed my burrito and enjoyed the atmosphere on a busy Saturday evening.",

Even though I love authentic Mexican food, sometimes you just want some wingos tacos with a side of waffle fries! And don't forget the ranch to dip it all in.   The sangria is delicious. Our service has always been pretty good with speedy and nice servers. I also like the large bar area and all the tables that surround it.   We've even done take out a few times and when we order the guac to go, it comes with our very own pre packaged bag of chips. The presentation is great.   And of course I have to mention the goblerito. Only available seasonally, but it's just a must have around Thanksgiving. You'll need a nap afterwards but it's well worth the calories and fullness. Mashed potatoes, beans, turkey, corn, and stuffing all wrapped up in a burrito. With gravy. And cranberry sauce. Cmon.",

I like the Ruby Red grapefruit one, but recently tried a seasonal cranberry sage margarita that was delicious.   If you join their mailing list, you can get coupons and I frequently go then. It's fun to split a burrito and their waffle fries. The waffle fries with queso and ranch are really good. There are also good wings and this location has seitan wings, which I've never gotten, but have heard are delicious.   This location gets pretty busy, especially during happy hour times, but the wait usually isn't too bad and service is fairly quick even when it is packed. It does get really loud though, so be aware of that. I love the decorations here. It's really big and airy and just a great location. Much better than the tiny one in Oakland.",

    "text": "So I've been to 4 of the 5 Mad Mex' in Pittsburgh and of those I would say that the Shadyside Location is probably the best. First off it's the only Location that is open until 2am, 7 nights a week, which in a city with very few late night dining options is a huge plus. The location itself is very hip and fun, and being in a somewhat stuffy part of town it doesn't feel uppity or pretentious. I find the service at this location to be slightly better than others that I've been too, and also the food is a little more consistent. However, even though the consistency is there, overall the food is just slightly above average. Everything I've had here has been good, but it strikes me as 'Pittsburgh Mexican Food, before Pittsburgh had Good Mexican Food.' If you Love tacos, these are good, but you can find better. If you want authentic, this isn't for you. If you want a good burrito, I honestly prefer Chipotle to Mad Mex. But, if you like craft beer and a good sipping tequila, while you munch on tasty, juicy chicken wings in anticipation of your consistently above average entrees. Than you could do a lot worse than this Mad Mex. Lastly, I'm not a big dessert guy, but you're gonna want to try the Nutella Stuffed Churros. In my opinion they are the most standout item on the menu.",

Unless there are some insane patio laws in shadyside, I highly doubt there's a law specifically about 2 chairs at a table vs 3.  Even if it was the case, the message was not delivered very nicely. Could have been handled way differently and will not be returning.",

    "text": "Mad Mex is a great place for some affordable Tex-Mex eats, yummy yummy margaritas, and a great time with a group.  It's a place that I like to go for a casual meet-up for drinks.  If you're at a table for an appetizer and a drink or two, the wait staff is not too pushy to get you to order a million things.    I love their margaritas.  And for a $5-$7 a drink anyone who complains should probably reassess their lives.    One of my go-tos are the mahi-mahi fish tacos.  You get so much fish.  Two nights ago, my friend and I ordered waffle fries and tacos.  I was pretty stuffed after the fries (that come with free cheese and ranch) that I had to take my tacos to go.  You get sooooo much food!  And there are so many great options for tacos, quesadillas, burritos, salads and more.  They also have pretty good guac at a decent price too.  For more choices than a place like Chipotle (where you run the risk of getting sick) and tacos that are more of a value than a certain trendy taco place in town... Mad Mex is a really solid choice for food, environment, and drinks.",

I'm a huge fan of anything dipped in their San Francisco sauce: Wingo tacos or wings. They also have delicious fajitas and are best know for their famous Gobblerito (seasonal dish). If you are ever there and it's on the menu, don't even think twice about it! Just be sure to pair it with a STBC Pumking.   I don't think I've ever had a bad meal here. They always have a great selection of craft beers and their sangria is one of the best in the city. Love Happy Hour? They have a great one on both drinks and food. The Shadyside location is one of my favorites because of the front patio and the restaurants also extremely large in size so there's never usually a long wait for a table.",

The replacement tastes like it has a 1/2shot in a 22oz drink. Our chips never showed up and our waitress only asked us how we were doing after we had to speak to the manager. This was close to the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. If the food wasn't so good I would have never though to come back.. Never got napkins, never got water, never got Chips, never got a buzz. But the manager assured me there was alcohol in there because they batch make it the mixes in the morning...whatever that means.  If you are willing to sacrifice service for a chance at good food, check out this location.",

Even though everything else on the menu looks good and my friend always gets the fajitas because he swears that's the best dish, I just keep getting the same thing. It gives me the illusion that I'm eating something healthy because it's grilled chicken and a salad (maybe it is healthy?), but it's also super flavorful. It comes with a chipotle aioli sauce, as well as a cilantro dressing, and they both go well with the dish (and together). We also got a Mexican Chocolate Brownie that was tasty. It was warm and we got it with a scoop of ice cream on top -- so good.  The service was quite good. I say this because my friend signed up to get a free birthday entree, but since he was born on a leap year, he never got an email with his free birthday entree. We told our server though and she was able to arrange for him to get his complimentary entree!",

Lord only knows how many of those delicious frozen margaritas I've gotten drunk off over the years lol.  I've been to all MM locations multiple times except Cranberry and maybe South Hills.  I spent the most time in the smaller Oakland location, especially when I lived in walking distance some years ago.  I spent many a nights stumbling home after late night margarita specials!!  Happy hour is my favorite time to visit with margarita and 16oz draft beer specials and half off wings.  You've gotta try the Gobblerito around Thanksgiving time, it's delicious!  I'm a fan of the blue cornbread, try that also!  They have great beer and tequila selections.  I love the dark ambiance and year-round Dia de los Muertos decor.  The colorful sugar skulls and wall murals make any location fun to be at.  Be sure to sign up for their email list.  You're supposed to receive a free birthday meal offer, but I failed to receive one for my last b-day, but it's all good lol.  Maybe I'll get one next year.  Also, be sure to visit <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBigburrito.com&s=9697bba17c9ae84546966916e20834369517f8cc1572bc3d98a3ddf7b27fef10\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bigburrito.com</a> for special announcements, seasonal food menu changes, holiday events and more.  My favorite bartenders here are Sara and Jackie.  Parking can be slim along Highland, but I believe they offer free valet parking across the street for customers. Visit a Mad Mex location today for a good time...",

The restaurant is planned out amazingly well.  I'm told each location shares the same theme, but are decorated individually.  When the weather is nice they'll open up the large garage style doors that make up the front of the restaurant; which allows for the feeling that you're enjoying the outdoors while not needing to be exposed, that in mind they do have outdoor seating for those who wish to enjoy the weather fully.  They have a wide range of alcoholic beverages, but you have to try a flavored Margarita.  They have six of so to choose from, and you have have them froze or unfrozen.  It was warm enough day that the frozen ones were perfect for the situation.  Be careful though; they make'm strong ;)  The food was scrumptious and not overly priced.  Obviously with it's Mexican background the food is Mexican, but they are accommodating to requests  The burritos are huge and topped with the Mad Mex logo when it arrives at the table.  It appears they pay special attention to the finer details which allows their patrons to enjoy their amazing food, environment, and well attentive staff.  So; I'll say to you - You can't leave Pittsburgh without trying Mad Mex ;)",

Both times I've been here, I've come with a group during happy hour.  I don't recall what I ordered the first time, but the second time, I ordered the fish tacos.  They were disappointing--the fish didn't seem very fresh, and its flavor was drowned out by the salsa.  The refried beans and rice that came with it were pretty nondescript, as well.  I don't recall much about the chips, so they must not have struck me as particularly tasty.  The margaritas, on the other hand, were pretty good.  I personally don't have the alcohol tolerance for the Big Azz margarita, so I went with the smaller ones both times.  I believe I ordered the strawberry once and the mango once, and they were both decent.  Be forewarned that it's extremely crowded during happy hour, and that the noise level is extremely loud.  If I came here again, I'd skip the food and would try to sit at the bar and order chips and a margarita.  If I came around Thanksgiving, I might try the gobblerito, however, since this seems to be a popular option.",

This place is no different. Their menu is mostly some variation of those three basic ingredients, which isn't a problem unless you have a hard time processing dairy.  I had a much difference experience the other night. All i did was order my burrito without the cheese. No other special requests or requirements.  Of all places, the kitchen decided it was best to separate their blue corn bread (which contains dairy) on another plate.  I was blown away. I've never received that level of care and forethought before in the five years I've had a difficulty processing dairy.  Absolutely fantastic performance from their kitchen staff. I've told everyone I've seen since about their quality decision making.  I know lactose intolerance isn't the end of the world if you have no problem digesting dairy. If you do have a hard time, you surely feel like I do: everything in America is covered with cheese.  That night I felt like someone I don't know cared.",

I was walking in Shadyside one afternoon and saw the outdoor seating with the garage windows up and decided it looked poppin enough to give it a try. I sat at the bar since I was alone & didn't want to take up a table.  It took about 5 minutes for the bartender to actually acknowledge a human sat down because she was chatting with fellow server.   The chips come from a bag & are stale af. The salsa they give you is dry & not Pico dry but just soggy. The margaritas are average AT BEST.   The only redeeming quality is the pretty great beers on tap. I don't typically crave mediocrity and stale chips so I don't foresee myself coming back.",

The chips and salsa was great, along with the other type of dips. I received a special meal being vegan (grilled portabella) which was excellent as I made a fajita with the vegetables on the buffet.   The atmosphere and food was excellent. My only negative was the service. Because of that many people the 2 servers were not able to keep up with drink orders, so-much-so that I never received one other than water, which I got myself. Good thing I no longer drink or I would have thrown a Tequila Fit.   I would go back, with a much smaller group of 1.",

They have rotating items like margaritas that use seasonal fruit, summer street corn, and other appetizers/main dishes- I love that they try new things and stay engaged. Services has always been quick and friendly. The hour deals are great but I would caution people to order the smaller HH drinks. My husband and I ordered the largest margarita size and although it was delicious and cheap, it was watered down by the end. We are not particularly slow drinkers and even then would have enjoyed 2 smaller drinks more.   They also have a lot of beers on tap and outdoor seating! It's in a great area. The only downside to this place is chips and salsa are not free which I found shocking the first few times we came here!!",

The waiter actually asked if I wanted the small order or the larger one. LOL. Who do I look like? Of course I want the larger order! It would be about $8! Yes please. I always get the BBQ sauce on the side. I like to do this so I can dunk the wings in myself and if I want to then get another sauce, I can without ruining or mixing the sauce flavors. I also get the blue cheese because I love their blue cheese. Does anyone else think that the spice they add to it puts it just a little over the top?  The only issues were the service. We would ask for things and those requests would never come. One of the requests came when we got our checks. We were brought out sour cream with our checks...not good.   The wings are so good. I love that they are hearty, meaty, and oh so crispy. I ate half and took the rest home for lunch. I do wish they would give out a little more celery, but I bet if I asked they would oblige.  I think this is a fine place to head out to for happy hour. Get your Margs and wings; all while enjoying the atmosphere and your friends!",

My favorite time to visit Mad Mex is for Happy Hour and their deliciously flavored margaritas. These usually change monthly and during the summer they had a Peach flavor which was amazing.  I've had some hit and miss experiences with dinners here so I usually stick with a variety of apps to share amongst the table. For example the last time I ordered a meal, a quesadilla, there was literally no cheese on it. It's a quesadilla! However, their apps make up for this large oversight, especially their guac which has just the right amount of kick to it.",

The cheese was way to spicy so we sent it back and ordered the traditional salsa which was OK. for my main meal, I ordered the wing-o tacos. this is my second time ordering these. I really time them. you get a choice of several different wing sauces and the chicken is in the chicken tender form dipped in the wing sauce. I have tried the San Francisco and the Honey Chipotle BBQ. they are both delicious. The meal comes with three tacos and a side of waffle fries which are equally as good.",

But it is one of those places where if you want a lot of food but are kind of indifferent regarding its standoutishness, then I would go to Mad Mex. I don't think it's better than Chipotle. There's no way I would pay full price for their meals like their dinner menu lays out. There's just no way. I would pay the lunch price and think, eh, this is still a little over valued considering I need to tip a server. But $8.75 for a massive burrito and a cup of soup or salad . . . I can't really complain.   Our server here really wasn't great. At one point he left for like 30 minutes. I was getting worried about his well being as ours was deteriorating. I want to spend 40 minutes eating at a place like this, tops. Maybe you think I'm fussy - that's okay. We were here for 1hr 10min. Thank goodness we had no immediate plans!   The decor was nice! That's what made our long stay bearable (I'm just being hyperbolic). Ceilings are very high and I just enjoyed the vibe in this place!   I got a burrito and maybe everything would've been different had I gotten my friend's recommendation of fajitas. But that burrito is the place's #1 best seller . . .    The guac was a bit runny, and those of you who love some good gauc, that burned you reading that. You know what I'm talking about. It hurt me too.   I won't rush back to Mad Mex. It's popular and maybe so for other reasons other than the things I ordered. And that's cool. But Chipotle is right down the street . . . Dare I say better quality? Cheaper prices? Quicker experience?   I might.",

It had a nice kick to it and it had plenty of toppings and who doesn't love toppings?!  I would also like to add that I love the set up of this Mad Mex. I've been to multiple locations but none are as open as this one. It makes the restaurant appear much bigger and it allows for natural light to get in. The other locations feel so small and dark.",

The house salsa (extra charge) is a lousy blend of tomatoes and tomatoes. Entrees were just plain bad. Again, the consistently high ratings for this place mystify me. Have you had good (or even mediocre) Mexican before, Pittsburgh? The silver lining here was attentive service, despite a busy and obnoxiously loud dining room.",

    "text": "Location, Location, Location.  Any other Mad Mex would get 4 stars, but this one gets 5 because it has two levels, a large bar and is so much more spacious than any other one I've been to.  It gets a great, fun crowd too.   My favorite menu item is the Black Beanie quesadilla.  Something about the blend of spicy goodness and the sweet from the pineapple is absolutely perfect.  I also recommend the nachos.  The chicken nachos are fully loaded with chicken, guac, sour cream, jalapenos, cheese, beans and salsa.  It's a huge serving and could be a meal in itself.  Hands down, best nachos I've ever had and great to share with a group.  I also recommend doing the three salsa/dip deal as an appetizer.  The queso, guac, regular salsa and the pineapple habanero are quite tasty.  The pineapple one is really hot though so don't say I didn't warn you.  Now, I know everyone goes here for the margaritas which are a steal during happy hour but I've recently tried the red sangria and was delighted.  It's the perfect mix of sweet and dry and while I don't know the caloric intake, it has to be less calories than the big azz margaritas which are rumored to be over 800 calories.",

I had a Dark Horse Tres Blueberry Stout and was content. Who doesn't like blewbz? After sitting down at our table I noticed the 22 oz Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA special for...wait...$5. Face sufficiently melted, I ordered that next and continued to do so.  My steak Mad Mex burrito was stupendous and a master sculptor managed to somehow wrap it into a cube instead of the standard cylinder, thus requiring me to get all dexterous with my fork y knife.   Others had the San Fransisco wings (reported to be good but sugary) and grilled steak tacos (two opposable thumbs up), white sangria, and blackberry margaritas with a floater. What's a floater, you ask? I'll leave this one up to your imagination.   Due to the nice weather the large garage door style windows were opened up and by chance we happened to be sitting next to one. After signing our checks, I definitely departed through said opening.",

The only with the beer list is that it can get out of date and have a few beers on it that are already kicked.  I'll occasionally get a margarita - they're solid for sure, but I'd recommend going for a high-end option if you can splurge for it.  They do a great job with those.  I like the food.  It's fast, tasty and fills you up.  I almost always order the same thing - Black Bean & Pineapple Quesadilla.  Perfect portion for me at a restaurant where the portion sizes can be a bit large at times.  I also really like the chicken tortilla soup, nachos (real cheese - not cheese sauce) and the spicy bean dip.  On weekend nights - be prepared for big crowds and a long wait.",

    "text": "I can't really explain the joy I felt when I first heard that a Mad Mex was opening on Highland. The thought of not having to sojourn to the suburbs and to never again return to Oakland was almost too much.  Last night, after months of drive-by stalking, it was time for us to meet. I was so excited for the complimentary valet parking I'd seen advertised on the sign outside. But when we got there, the sign was gone, there was no valet parking; it was as if I'd imagined it.  My boyfriend and I ordered chips and avocado tomatillo salsa (our fave) and a burrito each. I ordered a side of sauce with my burrito which arrived not on the side but inside the burrito. Refills were hard to come by. The chips and salsa did not arrive until we had finished our meals, and the salsa was sour and terrible and not even close to the avocado tomatiilo salsa we know and love. And I'm going to sound super old when I say this but IT WAS SO LOUD IN THERE.  The prices are higher, probably because of the complimentary valet, the hip location, and because this is, for serious, the handsomest Mad Mex ever. It would have been worth it had the food been of typical quality and the service remotely adequate. But alas, I'll be driving back out to the suburbs for Mad Mex because there, at least, they love me back.  *Because this review isn't long enough already, I'd like to take this opportunity to remind all restaurant goers out there to please keep your shoes on. Other people exist and are trying to eat.*",

Really, If it weren't for the vegan food (of inconsistent quality), I'd avoid the (obnoxious) Mad Mex atmosphere at all costs.

Mad Mex isn't really even Mexican, which worked tremendously to my benefit. It's Tex-Mex inspired but they really consider using fresh ingredients and working different cuisines into the menu whenever possible. They had so many veggie options, from seitan wings to marinated tofu and veggie-abundant enchiladas. Everything we had was great, including the not-too-sweet sangria margaritas. I'd gladly go back!",

One of the first times I visited Pittsburgh before I moved up, my current boyfriend took me by this location for some midday drinking. I was immediately in love. The big windows out front were open, letting in a nice breeze, it was sunny, and the bartender was very good.   The restaurant was not very busy and the whole place had a very relaxed feel. Once I moved here, this became one of my go to spots to meet with people at - outside of the shitty parking, which isn't their fault.   They have a good number of beer offerings, though the best part in my opinion is their selection of beers. The craft brews they offer are always on point. And my boyfriend loves their sangrias. He says they do one of the best in town.  Lest I forget about the food, I will say that I do enjoy it quite a bit. The carne enchilada with blue cornbread (ooooh, that blue cornbread) is my favorite on the list for sure. And make sure you ask for chips and salsa! Even if I go just for drinks I still end up with chips and salsa.  I don't have any complaints, like I said outside of the parking. During lunch time, it's a real bitch.

Probabl, but oh well. I got a house margaritas on the rocks - too much citrus in the margarita. Needs to be balanced out with a little bit of sweetness. I also got the Mahi Mahi tacos - not bad but not great. Decor was a little over the top in it's Mexican spirited-ness. They do have a great beer selection, which may bring us back again. They also have featured breweries and beer specials every 5 weeks or so - this week was Brooklyn Brewery, a personal favorite.",

She was so genuine and hospitable, even in a late night rush, where other servers might check out and become apathetic. Not Meg--she made our night a complete breeze with her attentive presence and positive disposition. The tequila list is long and diverse, but I'm more of a beer and whiskey drinker. The tap beer and bourbon selection is quite varied and extremely well priced, and I was happy to imbibe on some local beer and delicious bourbon. The food is fine. However, I think the menu could be paired down. Maybe a little \"less is more\" could go a long way. There's hints at quality ingredients and preparation but the menu is just too long for any one thing to stand out.  The atmosphere is fun, loud music that begs for some dancing.  Thanks Meg, for making our dining experience easy and fun!",

Greentree had the best stocked bar in pittsburgh I heart anyplace which stocks Absolut Pear... Mango or Acai Berry Ive been to Bars here who couldnt stock any of these so A++ for booze at this location. Here they had all three.  Shadyside the Margaritas were so yummy and so were the buffalo wings I was in heaven. Though be careful ordering the expensive bigass one with the sidecar extra shot thing....... creepy little bugger makes for a big buzz later :)  I tried the pork Carnitas burrito at Monroeville, along with chips and salsa. Here i cried for the authentic mexican of the southwest I truly miss, because the carnitas were so bland, the rice was white (ew) spanish please, and there weren't really any beans or corn in the burrito. Suffice to say Chipotle makes a better carnitas pork burrito for the same price or less. Also my 12 oz margarita was super tart and boozey.  Salsa the chipotle and the blk bean were yumm, the nacho cheese was gross but ive never been a fan of that. I would read some more yelp reviews before ordering here again or maybe just go here for drinks and apps.",

The unflavored margaritas are pretty good; the flavored ones are meh.  They have a great beer selection (and tequila selection) and happy hour features discounts on wings (which are pretty good).

    "text": "First of all, the decor in here if offensively bad. It looks like a raging battle between a really crappy tattoo artist and a chic interior decorator, and what makes it worse is how pretentious it seems and how some straight male out there is probably really proud of it.  Second, the prices are kind of random and ridiculous for certain items. When you come here, don't expect to have a decent meal for less than 20$ once you ad a drink. This in and of itself is a crime to my mind when talking about Mexican food. Especially Tex-Mex. For instance, guacamole by itself cost 1.50 but chips with guacamole cost 7.50. Its good guac, but its not THAT good. And the chips are brutally crappy. I could buy similar quality chips at wal-mart.  I will give them credit for the tacos. I haven't personally tried them because I'm veggie and I don't like tofu, but my friend, who is a foodie, has enjoyed them on numerous occasions and says they're worth the cash. If you have a very good palette and enjoy fine dining but feel like tacos, these are the tacos for you. However, if you're not very discerning and enjoy a good taco stand, don't bother paying the extra for this.  Another thing that bothered me was the waitstaff. It isn't that they're terrible. They're just not that great either. They seem distant and disingenuous. Our waiter asked us if our food was good before we even had time to take a bite. The hostess looked positively miserable the entire time we were there and when we tried to eat here once before another hostess sat us in a high-top bar table without even asking if this was acceptable. I've been a hostess before. That, and the cold distant expression are both major party fouls.   My final complaint is the nachos. They were so bad that I left a comment card expressing my disdain. These people clearly know how to cook or they wouldn't be able to make such good tacos, so, I beg to know, WTF? They were 10$, which is randomly cheap for the amount you get, but when you taste them you might understand why. You get a huge pile of guac and salsa, both of which would be more expensive ordered on their own, and an enormous pile of chips covered in melted monterey jack and black beans. The beans tasted just like the ranch beans you can buy at the grocery and the overall taste really was reminiscent of frito-chilli-pie that you can buy at Sonic. My foodie friend agreed with me on the egregiousness of the whole thing and we left that plate nearly untouched.  Therefore, my advice is, don't go here unless you have a very discerning palette don't mind spending more than is normal for food. If you do go, order the tacos. Do not order anything else. The steak on the tacos actually was medium rare, as asked for, and this was impressive. But if you'd be satisfied with a taco stand, just go to Pizza Sola. Its right down the street and the food is better, and cheaper, and the decor won't make you gag.",

    "text": "Ok here goes,  Mad Mex is the Tex-Mex offering of the Big Burrito conglomerate of restaurants. As far as Tex-Mex goes, you could do worse. You could do better, but let's just focus on the here and now.   My girlfriend (a common partner in my culinary escapades) thinks that Mad Mex is,  to quote, \"the shit.\" At the risk of a  sreiously unhappy relationship, I must disagree. I think it is mediocre at best.   We will start with the atmosphere of the place. It is packed to the walls with new age yuppies each trying to posture as much as possible and show the world how great they are. I don't care, I'm not impressed and neither is anyone else. As as result of everyone in the joint trying to tell the world how great they are, the noise level is a little high for my tastes. Also, after a certain hour, the lights are dimmed to the point where you can barely see your date (a potential plus if you have some evil friends who like blind dates), let alone read the menu. Not that it matters.  The menu is rather standard fare for Tex-Mex, but it all tastes the same. No matter what you get, it all tastes like spice with a vinegar, pickled backbone. I don't mind spice, hell I like it, but spice should be an accent to the flavor, not the sole player.   Mad Mex has a decent beer selection, but it all seems to be kind of run of the mill craft selections. I know that sounds like an oxymoron so let me explain: they do have a fairly healthy variety of decent craft beers, but nothing unique to them. At least at a place like Fat Heads I can get something like Bear Republic Racer 5 on a hand pump. Mad Mex is limited to the standard Dogfishead, Rogue, and Sierra Nevada you see everywhere. As a Tex-Mex place, they do have a nice selection of tequila and their margaritas are \"bomb\" according to my better half.  As far as service goes, it was borderline, which I don't necessarily consider a bad thing. The servers were friendly and attentive, but not overbearing, which I like. They seemed to grasp the concept that I was there to enjoy my friends' company, not theirs.  All in all it wasn't a loathsome experience and I will probably be back, if only to satisfy the girlfriend. And now I am off to the couch...",

Chicken Chimi - my partner ordered this after I said it was a fried burrito. It was just okay, but he wanted to just eat my burrito since it was a lot tastier.   Carnitas Burrito - the burrito I ordered. Most excellent!  Delicious pulled pork, with sour cream, it's a dream!

We had walked by and mad mex was packed and we loved the open-ness of the restaurant itself.   My husband ordered 2 large beers which he enjoyed. And I ordered guac -- it was tasty but I would have liked it a bit more spicy. We then ordered some salsa. 1. The pineapple habanero salsa which was deliciously sweet with the right amount of heat and 2. The fire roasted tomato salsa. Both were yummy in our tummies.  I ordered their special, the fried chicken tacos with sour cream siriacha. My only complaint was the size of the chicken pieces which were shoved into tortillas. The chicken was large and the tortillas were small. Maybe they could have been chopped up before assembling.   My husband ordered a burrito with some of their inferno sauce on the side and he enjoyed it.   My dish came with rice and beans but I was too full to eat more.  We sat in a booth next to the roll up door which was pretty cool.  I would return!",

Unfortunately they did not have frozen margaritas available for whatever reason. Their frozen margaritas are typically very good, they have a good ice-liquid consistency. Once seated, the service was not great, our waiter was running from table to table doing his best though. We had the \"Jersey Chips\" to start, basically waffle fries with queso and ranch on the side. They were great, their ranch is really good. I had the Spicy Mad Mex Burrito. Their burritos are enormous and oddly square-shaped. They don't come with any sides, but given their size I can't imagine you'd want to eat anything else. The good news is you'll likely have leftovers to take home.",

I got so flustered and thirsty, I stood up and just walked over to the bar. The Bartender Sam, who is incredibly sweet, immediately took my order and gave me a water.  He was really sorry about what happened and gave us some complimentary chips and guac, AND a coffee. I ordered the angry hippie burrito, which had portobellos, beans, spinach, rice, cheese and tomatoes. I got both sour cream and more guac on the side. I also ordered an appetizer of the Pennsyltucky fried tofu. The mix of the sauce, nuts and sprouts are so good! A must try for vegetarians and non-vegetarians both! The burrito was also very tasty. Not a super intense flavor, but you can easily add your own salsas/hot sauces etc to spice it up. I appreciated the lack of spice to be quite honest.   All in all, still a good experience.

    "text": "We're big Mad Mex fans. We visit the Shadyside, McKnight, Monroeville, and new FC locations. We typically eat there several times a month because our son can't eat dairy and it's one of the few family friendly places with lots of options for him w dairy substitutes. But we've been going to Mad Mex for 20 years now. I lived near the original during college. My husband and my first date was there. And we've kept up our tradition as we started a family. They're very kid friendly, coloring, kids menu etc. it's usually filled w plenty of families at these locations.   Today was my sons 3rd bday. He picked Mad Me. For his bday dinner so we went to Shadyside's by our works.   As soon as we were seated I noticed the table next to us was being extremely vulgar and loud about it. I try not to be the language police when out it's typically not this extreme. I myself have had one too many margs there and I know non parents aren't as aware of it and even some patents are more lax. We tend to try and avoid it cause our son is pretty precocious and will latch on to new words quickly. And I noticed he soon took note of it as well. At times every other word was an f bomb, loud. I bit my tongue because I sensed by their convo they wouldn't take even a polite request to tone it down well. As soon as my husband joined us he noticed as well. I suggested we just ignore it but it was so excessive. So he caught their attention and very politely asked to tone it down at least in volume and pointed out our son and his bday. They reacted even more poorly than I expected. They yammered on of how we should go to eat n park instead and didn't tone it down at all. I tried to explain why we came to no avail. This was at like 530 on a Wed in the dining area, not at the bar. At least half of the tAbles were families.   Management stepped in and had them leave immediately. They were SO accommodating and apologetic. Every staff member involved was exemplary. S/O to Eric and Don and our server Andrew. They even gave us some special coupons which wasn't expected at all.   I just wanted to thank their team for being so amazing. It's not how we wanted our little guy's bday to go but they more than made up for it.   If you made it this far wow lol  Tldr great staff very family friendly and our families fav restaurant in PGH!",

Luckily there's a little bar called the Hideaway right next door so we went over there.   The waitress was great! She was attentive, kind, and informative. She didn't seem phased by the crowds or drunk people.   I ordered the barbacoa tacos and they were okay but not great (rating 3). The meat taste a bit too much like pot roast. The rice was extremely bland and dry (rating 1) the fire roasted salsa (rating 4) and guacamole (rating 5) were both fantastic.   I would come back for apps and drinks but probably not for dinner!",

Many firsts were established at the Highland Avenue location - first date over dinner, first fight fueled by tequila, first meal as a married couple, first meal after announcing our pregnancy, first meal with our newborn.  It cured countless pregnancy cravings.  Plus, we've successfully converted our chain restaurant loving families into addicts - literally, they do not exit Pittsburgh without a burrito.  Lots of love - right?  But why, you may ask.  I could rattle off a list, however, it all boils down to it being an affordable restaurant with consistent food/drinks/service in a fun atmosphere.  My dad raves that you cannot get a delicious burrito for under $10 a chain restaurant (even though he's still cannot fathom paying to add guacamole).  And the servers (especially Sam, he's awesome) know us by name.  As cheesy as it sounds, we feel at home in this establishment.    Fun fact: I've never ordered the same item twice (except for a frozen strawberry Big Azz margarite - I always get those).  A large menu make it easy to try something new every time.",

I haven't been inside of this location as my friend ordered me food to go very late at night, but I seriously wish I had known about this place a long time ago. At $9 a pop, you get a massive burrito filled with vegetable goodness.   It was hard to eat, and I only had half for dinner. The other half made excellent leftovers for a hangover breakfast the next day. I was pleased!   I guess it's a little difficult to thoroughly review a place if you haven't EXPERIENCED it. I can say that I am immensely impressed with the vegan options. I don't have to eat a plain burrito here, I can go all out with vegan sour cream and cheese too. That's the beauty of Mad Mex.  I hope I get to visit again in the future. I find myself craving one of those Angry Hippie burritos time to time, and right now is definitely one of those times!",

Multiple crafts of tap and bottle selection. Margaritas: this is probably the only place I get a margarita. Ever since college when Tequila and I broke up, I have steered clear from even the margarita. Mad Mex makes a great one. Seasonal ones are pricey. Stick to the classic.  Food. I love their chips and salsa.  That the best part of the meal as far as I'm concerned. You can also get this to go which is typically a hit for the on the go party appetizer. The trio dip app is worth it. Definitely get the guac. It's great.  Every burrito I've had has been awesome. I'm partial to the fajita one. As of late I've been on to the mahi tacos. Fresh, and a little lighter than the burritos. Last time I asked for no rice and they LOADED me up with black beans to sub. Great to not skimp on that. The black beans are lovely, too. You can also get the burritos in a bowl.  The Pennsyltucky tofu app is pretty damn delicious.  Now...the must is the Gobbblerito at Thanksgiving (and occasionally in the summer or craft beer week by surprise.) Why does Thanksgiving dinner taste so good in a burrito? Because it does.  They also have awesome mail coupons and free entree for your birthday if you sign up. Happy Birthday!",

This is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh and so happy they opened this location in Shadyside which is much bigger and more open than the one in Oakland.  The happy hour specials are great-1/2 all drafts (they always have a great selection of beers), $7 big ass margaritas, and 1/2 priced wings. I usually get the $3 little butt margaritas on happy hour special so that I can try a few flavors including the new Sangria margarita. It wasn't as good as I was hoping but worth the try. The apple cider one is delicious with a sugar mixture around the rim to top it off.  Of course the Gobblerito was fantastic and worth the try even if you are a little hesitant.",

Back in college, I use to go to half off and the Oakland Mad Mex, but that was the only good part since the space was cramped and crowds were rowdy; this newer location solves those problems and it even has complimentary valet parking! ($2 tip) The space is huge and I have had no problems walking in on a Saturday night with a group of 5.  The margaritas here are definitely a good deal during happy hour and the Big Azz hits the spot. Most of the flavors use real fruit so they can be on the tart side but I enjoy the fresh flavor. You cant go wrong with the guac and chips here or the wings as both are made very well and I cant make any complaints about the taste of the entrees I've gotten (Chicken Fajita, Chicken Burrito). The portion is also huge so there's no way you'll walk out hungry.  I will definitely come back again because its convenient and a guaranteed good time any night.",

Having said that, I don't think they have a very good Margarita (which should be tequila, triple sec or Cointreau, and fresh lime juice).  The food at Mad Mex tastes great and it's made from fresh ingredients.  The decor is consistent with the Mad Mex branding, and there's original artwork throughout the restaurant.  I love the high ceiling, the different seating options, and the huge open wall that faces Highland Ave.  This is by far my favorite of all the Mad Mex locations.",

The happy hour is the best. 4:30-6:30pm half off drafts (they always have an AWESOME selection) and wings, and $3 12oz, $7 22oz house margaritas (they have a 16 oz but I can't remember the price).  I know you may think \"wings at a Mexican place?!?\" but 1. It's not Mexican Mexican and 2. The wings are soooo good I crave them all the time. I like the southwest and San Francisco wings. I've never tried the other ones because I tend to stick to what I know and love haha.  We always get the veggie burrito which has delicious portobello mushrooms, corn, zucchini, black beans, rice, onions, and peppers. If we're feeling adventurous we will add meat which is an extra charge but worth it if you're craving meat. My husband and I split it because it's so big. We also tend to get the 5oz black bean dip which is the perfect size for us.. we are pretty light eaters.   I have been here soooo many times and I feel like this review is well overdue. I have NEVER been disappointed with the food or the service here. All the staff have been so amazing to us. Thanks Madmex shadyside. :)",

    "text": "Good bar. Decent food. Its tex mex in Pittsburgh, what do you really expect?   Mad Mex is a strange restaurant. The whole thing just feels kind of medium. The food is medium. The service is medium. The prices are pretty medium.   The food itself is always fine, but never out-of-this-world good. Everything from their fajitas to the burritos to the salads taste good, but never much beyond.   For example, on my most recent trip we ordered the 3-dip appetizer. The chips were fine, but not great. The guacamole was good, but not out of the ordinary. The cheese dip and the salsa were less interesting, but fine.   After years of hearing about the fabled \"Gobblerito\" I finally ordered one and I was disappointed. Perhaps the hype was almost impossible to live up to, but I found it to be \"good\". (For those unfamiliar, its turkey, gravy, mashed potatoes, corn, black beans  and stuffing in a burrito).   The one thing that lifts Mad Mex is its bar. I love their selection and have a particular affinity for their margaritas (frozen or standard). Delicious stuff!",

I recently went with a friend and she busted out a coupon that they sent her for her birthday so her entree was free. You just need to ask the waitstaff for a card to sign up for their email list. In a couple of weeks, you get an email and then if you click on the link and complete sign up, they will send you a coupon for a free entree and then you get a burrito coupon for your birthday.   As for the food - in all my years in attendance, I almost always get the same dish (the chicken chimi). It's just too good so I can't stray! Though I did try a gobblerito once. Has to be done! The chips and salsa are a must and their frozen margaritas come in all kinds of yummy flavors. Great spot for happy hour, late night, or any time really. Good number of vegetarian options as well.",

The waiter was extremely courteous and always made sure that everyone was being served. As such, I was particularly pleased with the customer service.   Regarding the qualify of the food I would say it really depends on what you order. I especially enjoyed the crispy tofu as well as the quesadillas - those were a hit. Wasn't as much a fan of the shrimp/mushroom and potato filled appetizers though. The tortilla chips were overly salty but there was a nice assortment of dips that accompanied them. The salsa had a nice bite, the pico de galo was fresh and the bean dip complimented the cheese dip nicely. I would definitely order at least some of the food here again.  I didn't think the restaurant was well suited for a board meeting since it was hard to talk over the loud music playing in the background but it was nice for them to attempt to accompany us anyway. Loved the colorful ambiance of the walls and ceiling!  we lived the dips and appetizers",

(Boston, Chicago, Portland, LA, SF, etc.) But never had I come across the culty reputation of this establishment.   I visited on a broody storming evening so probably less crowded than usual. Immediately I was blown away by the vibrant decorum. High ceilings, weird fusion interpretations of mexicana lore, sports television. It was like day of the dead in a stadium bleacher.   The menu was several pages long, I love reading material and images and stuff like that so that was great. I got the veggie burrito and my partner got the shrimp tacos. Before I had time to really study the decorum and before I could even think a single thought the food appeared immediately before me on the table. I could barely even remember having ordered it. Maybe because I was going in on a \"big ass\" 22 oz margherita that comes with blue salt!!! Where the hell do you get blue salt from?? Industry secret for sure. I am baffled!!  Anyways, my burrito was a steamy square stuff with all sorts of veggies. I'm currently 1 handed due to a commute injury and I could hardly eat this mammoth of a Latin inspired dish. And the tacos came with like 24 shrimp! My gosh. This place was like applebees and chipotles got together after having binged at a cheesecake factory.

The male bartender who served my boyfriend was right beside this lady, and did not SAY ANYTHING to her as she was yelling at us. This was just the end of the shabang, as I had already had enough of her attitude when I walked towards the bar... The beginning moments where she was rude was when I first walked up and politely said I had a question... she goes \"what\" with the most stern and angry face.

We probably went to the Shadyside location when the waiter was having an off day. I'm giving a 3 star rating (originally gave 1 star). The food was very good, but I don't know how this location would have been second time around since we went to the other one. Thanks, Mad Mex!  I'm surprised this place has such high ratings. It's been recommended to me by several people whose taste buds I may not trust as much anymore. My boyfriend and I ordered two different kinds of enchiladas, and they were both so disappointing. The enchilada was literally two sad corn tortillas topped with an even sadder amount of cheese with a small amount of meat inside. That's it. I'm Latina, so of course I'm prepared for Tex Mex to be different than homemade goodness, but I've been to some really great Tex Mex places. We paid extra for guac for both of our entrees and surprise surprise we didn't receive it (still had to pay) or any of the other condiments I ordered. I don't see the craze, nor am I really interested in trying to find out by ordering something else. Everything is pricey and below average. If you go here... good luck.",

The southwestern style consists of cilantro, garlic, lime, olive oil, and oregano. The small order has 7 wings. The wings were delicious! They were nice and crispy and the sauce was fingerlicking good. This sauce is one of my favorites in the city as it is pretty unique. Overall, a nice place to grab some mexican food with friends.

Especially with overall aesthetic as where we were the lighting was almost impossibly dim.  It was so dark.     My girlfriend and I went to dinner at this Mad Mex on 8/14, ordering and splitting the Fried Tofu, Jersey Chips and Crispy Shrimp Tacos.  The following day, we both fell violently ill with food poisoning and had to call off work.  We contracted rhodavirus (or however its spelled) from the shrimp tacos specifically.  The Jersey chips are a nice staple, but the fried tofu, while tasty, was too overpowered by the soy sauce concoction. The poisonous shrimp tacos left us both sick for multiple days, through today for my girlfriend.   We each filed a complaint online and she called the Allegheny Health department, who investigated on 8/16.  I spoke with one of this Mad Mex's managers, Beth, over the phone on Friday after she emailed me responding to my complaint the afternoon of 8/16.  In less than 24 hours (one phone call was at 4:30pm and the other was the following morning at 9:30am, a mere 17 hours later), two phone messages were left on my phone and when i called back (I was not inclined to call Thursday, 8/16, still feeling ill, and was intending on calling 8/17 anyway) i was simply asked a couple very generic questions and given a very apathetic and bureaucratic apology by the aforementioned manager.    Short Story Long, we will not be back.  This review likely has no bearing on your decision to go to Shadyside Mad Mex; frankly if you've gotten this far, you probably think i'm a ranting lunatic gunning for Mark Madden's spot on the radio.  Regardless of the accuracy of that, I suggest you not go to this location of Mad Mex.",

    "text": "My partner talked this place up so much my expectations were pretty high, however, Mad mex Shadyside did not meet my expectations nor my partners. I don't think it was nearly as good as he remembered from years ago for several reasons.  1) The service was mediocre at best. She would not honor the student discount with my student ID for a portion of the check that was not the lunch special. Additionally, there was an added meal on our check that was not ours, and we needed to ask for the desert that came with the kids meal my daughter had.   2) The food was mediocre as well. Chipotle or Cafe rio is much better than this sit down. The burritos have a much higher rice and bean ratio than meat. The chicken tortilla soup was okay, but not great. Also, chips and salsa did not come with the meal like all Mexican restaurants I've eaten at. I thought that was pretty standard, but apparently not here. Also, the guacamole on the side for the burrito was an added 1.50 when I think it really should be included. For a $40 tab I would have expected a better meal overall.  3) I don't think this is the most sanitary place to eat. My water had a black thing within an ice cube that looked like black mold, so I doubt they clean their ice maker regularly.   In summary this place is just \"Meh\" for us. It was not the good quality my partner remembered from growing up, and I don't think we'll ever be returning unless there really is no other option for food, which I don't see happening in any situation. I would skip this place if I were looking for good quality authentic Mexican cuisine.",

We went on a Friday night and had to wait 15-20 minutes for a table for two, but it wasn't a big deal. I had the Mad Mex burrito (if that sounds like the correct name) and a big azz frozen apple pie type seasonal margarita. Which hit me like a ton of drunken bricks halfway through my burrito. Wow! Tequila is both my friend and my enemy. Anyway. The margarita was delicious, the burrito was delicious, service was good, and I have no complaints. Everything I've ever had at Mad Mex is good :)",

Lots of options for every kind of eater/diet, made clear on the menu and on their website. Vegan options are especially nice, with vegan cheese and sour cream options at no extra cost :)  The prices are usually around 10 bucks a dish, but their portions are HUGE and keep super well for a leftover meal (or two).  I'm a fan of this location since it's so big (although it'll still be packed with an hour wait on a Friday or Saturday night), and in the summer it's a real treat to sit with a Bigazz margarita with the big windows open to Highland Avenue.",

Some of my favorite things on the menu include the black bean dip which is creamy, spicy, and completely vegetarian, as well as the shrimp and spinach quesadilla. You have the option to get a whole wheat tortilla, which is nice. I also love the California salad which is loaded with alfalfa sprouts.   The vegan ranch is interesting, but I prefer the regular ranch dressing. Yum! It's great that there are so many vegan and vegetarian options, though. My brother is vegan, and when he comes to visit from Nashville (where there aren't a ton of vegan options), he always wants to go to Mad Mex.",

I had the Mad Mex Quesadilla with shrimp. It started out really good, but then my cheese got cold and it really fell apart from there. I ended up opening it and eating it with my fork. Great portion sizes, however. Our waiter Bill was also very attentive. Reasonably priced and in a good area.",

Happy Hours here are a great deal. Their tap selection usually showcases an exceptional range and variety and their mixed drinks stand up to comparison with much more cocktail-oriented bars. The staff here is friendly and accommodating even when they are completely slammed [which is when I encounter a more three star experience ].   Wait times -- which are largely out of their control -- can be excessive on weekends so if you're coming here on a Friday happy hour, get here early and prepare for a crowd. If crowds are your thing, then this is your place.   Food is consistently well prepared and inventive [although the menu doesn't change often]. Their Sunday brunch which I just tried for the first time recently is a highlight.   All in all, not a bad place to unwind after the week, meet friends for a Sunday Funday, or grab lunch during the work week.",

    "text": "I came here Saturday evening yesterday and seeing that there were several seats available at the bar I took one and sat down. The bartender approached me and asked me what I would like. I said just a glass of water. She asked if I wanted anything else and I said no I'm fine. She gave me a disgruntled look and walked away. Shortly after, another bartender approached me and asked me if I wanted anything and I said I was okay. He said would you like a menu. Feeling a little guilty I agreed to take one but said I ate earlier. He then asked if I had any intention of ordering anything. I said I wasn't sure and then I offered to give up my seat if more people came, after which he then left. I immediately got off my seat and left the establishment.  I can't recall anytime in recent history being treated like that. While I respect the need for establishments to make money and to attract paying customers, it did not sit well with me that I could not even sit down at their bar and relax for a few moments with a drink of water. On plenty of occasions I've gone to other establishments and not been hassled over ordering water. If treated nicely or if the bar was crowded, I would tip when given water or would order something since I do understand their business needs. However, treating a potential customer like a vagrant off the street and not offering any initial hospitality is not a wise business model. This form of treatment makes them feel insulted and not only discourages them from becoming paying customers, but encourages them to write negative reviews and to share their story word of mouth to anyone who will listen.  If management is so adamant that every person entering their establishment is a paying customer then they must make it into a policy that is clear to incoming patrons. This can be done by putting up signs and also by training personnel to respectfully inform patrons of this policy when they sit at the bar. Digressing, if the bar was crowded and if I continued to order water then I could see their point.  One other point I should make is that I had just spent $60 at Casbah, the adjacent restaurant, which if I understand correctly, is operated under the same management. Regardless, no incoming patron deserves to be treated like a deadbeat. Any successful business model incorporates courtesy, respect, hospitality, and the crazy notion that any incoming patron has the potential to become a repeat customer if they are treated right. From the treatment I received, I can see that either no such model exists for this establishment, or the hiring or training regimen is in need of some TLC. The experience I had infuriated me and, short of a sincere apology, I will never go back and will share this experience with others.",

She had someone else bring out the waters and when she came back herself she told us that one of our guests could not be served.

The decor of the restaurant was unique with many different wall paintings and oddities but probably familiar to those who have ever been to a Mad Mex restaurant before.  Upon sitting down I noticed that they had a nice beer list but did not order any due to it being lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  For lunch I ordered the Wing-A-Rito burrito with insane buffalo sauce while my dining companion had the Thai Curry burrito.  My burrito was comprised of rice, cheese, beans, chicken and the buffalo sauce which did not disappoint.  It was hotter than most sauces that I have ordered yet still had a good solid taste to it.  It was served with a side of salsa which was all that was left on my plate whenever I had finished.  My dining companions burrito also tasted good and did remind me of a nice Thai curry dish.  It was topped with bean sprouts and came with a side of slaw that was vinegar based.  Overall we were both very satisfied with our meals and nothing was left except for the salsa whenever we were done.  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely be back to a Mad Mex in the future.  They have not only a wonderful selection of Margaritas and beer but the food is good and does not lighten the wallet too much.",

    "text": "Went there with friends tonight (a Wednesday), early (we thought) at 6 o'clock, and the wait was already a half-hour for tables.  We only really wanted margs and chips/guac anyway, so thought it was only fair that we go into the bar area in the middle of the restaurant for our happy hour - and by 'happy' I was shooting for 'getting to sit' and by 'hour' I mean I didn't have all night.  So we get our drinks and end up standing quite awhile behind the people sitting at the bar, as many of them save seats for their late/invisible friends. We were getting really hungry for something to nosh on and couldn't really see a way to do this when we couldn't even physically reach the bar, so we decide to try our luck hovering by the bar tables instead... low and behold, one finally opens up!!  We beat out girls who had not been waiting as long and got to it faster.  And then...lower and beholder, a waitress comes over and tells us those are NOT bar tables, they're ones you have to be seated in by the hostess.  Silly us, thinking the high up tables with barstools in the sectioned-off bar area were for bar patrons!  So, we had to get back up and wait allll over again. Ultimately the service was fine, but that the woman was not even remotely apologetic about this was weird to me.  You'd also think that 'please see host/ess for seating at this table' signs would be warranted...the two other Mad Mex's I've been to, Oakland and North Hills, both have tables in their bar area, so it's not like it was some crazy idea I came up with.  So some type of signage would've been appreciated. Alas, Big Burrito is taking over the world (I'm sure they'll be catering the UPMC hospital cafeterias soon) so it obviously does not matter what I think.  I've never had THAT much trouble getting seated, at the bar or at a table, at the Oakland location...and for my money, especially if I'm hungry, the North Hills location I've never seen have a wait. And contrary to what many people who live in the East End think -- the North Hills is REALLY not far. This just irritated the crap out of me this evening -- unless you have all the time in the world, go to Buffalo Blues. The food is just as good and you won't have to wait until your first child is born to get to sit down after a long day of work.",

I have to say the meal as a whole was more sweet than salty was a little bit of a let down. I really enjoyed the crispiness of the chicken and was hoping for a more crispy waffle. My friend ordered the breakfast burrito and it was my favorite burrito that I have had so far at Mad Mex. It was stuffed with eggs, potatoes, peppers, bacon, cheese etc.   I would recommend getting any of the appetizers especially the black bean dip because it is delicious. I would not recommend the burritos (other than the breakfast one) since they are basically just completely filled with rice and they are bland.",

Two of the friends I was dining with are vegan and there were a ton of options for them, which was a huge plus! They even have Daiya dairy/soy/gluten free cheese!   Anywho, I'll start with the drink I ordered. I got a 12 dollar Don Julio VIP margarita that has an inside out lime floating on top (a floater) and a shot of tequila in it. I got it on the rocks, which I regretted, because the thing was EXTREMELY watered down, almost tasteless. I won't be spending 12 dollars on that again. You can add the floater to any drink, so I think I'd get the 5 dollar margarita and add it on instead in the future!  As for the meal, they have a lot of options for people who are gluten free! All of the allergen information is listed clearly on their website for dairy, gluten, soy and peanut. You must inquire about any other allergies. They have a lot of gluten free options, such as their plain meats (carnitas, steak, chicken, shrimp) and you can sub in a corn tortilla for a lot of the menu items. They also have a \"bare-ito\" that allows you to make any burrito into a bowl! Good stuff.   Soy allergy info: There are not a lot of soy-free options or substitutes here. Almost everything is marinated, fried, or cooked in soybean oil.   For this reason, I got a plain salad with tomatoes on it with oil and vinegar. They charged me 9 dollars for it. I wasn't too happy about that, but whatever. The rest of my friends' portions were huge and delicious for a good price. Our waitress was super friendly and all of my friends enjoyed their meals.   I really bumped up the stars from 3 because of the vast options and information they have for those with dietary restrictions, as well as the good service.",

My friends and colleagues seem to love this place -- and maybe it's just me, but I never understood why.  Sure, their burritos are twice the size of any burrito you can get in, say, Chicago; but what does that matter if they only have half the flavor?  Their food is always artfully presented, with colorful sauces everywhere; but when your \"hot\" sauce is mild to the point of tastelessness, what's the point?  And finally, the cost -- sure they give you a lot, but they charge you a commensurately high price.  I think I'd rather spend my money at Chipotle, honestly.  Not recommended.",

    "text": "Let's just say when people ask me (Miss Yelp! Elite) what my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant is I don't hesitate to say Mad Mex.  In fact, Mad Mex has been my favorite for a good twenty years when the Atwood Street location in Oakland was the only one.  Now you can find a Mad Mex in several locations, and the one I'm reviewing is for the Shady Avenue, Shadyside, spot. I can't rave enough on the layout and design of this space.  Large bar in the middle with high tops surrounding it, huge garage door wall that is open as soon as the weather beats 60 degrees, sidewalk seating, inside booths, and a loft area with addition seating so you can peer down at all the cool kids hanging at the bar.  Phenomenal Mexican artwork largely displayed on the wall, awesome mason jars with green lights hung by rope decorating the bar and awesome wooden beams and floors.  You want to feel like you've gone somewhere cool?  Then come inside and enjoy. I've ordered several different options from the menu - favorites being the fried tofu appetizer, the \"pick-a-dilla\" dips and tortilla (pick three dips - and always make guacamole one of those choices!), the Mad Mex Burrito, and the shrimp quesadillas.  All a ten on the yum-o scale. Don't even get me started on their margaritas.  They're all delicious and the flavors change often with the seasons. For example, come in the fall and order an apple cider margarita, or stop by in the summer for a blackberry margarita...you get the drift.   Excellent selection of craft brews on tap including killer IPA options.  And, when the clock strikes fall, you can get Pumking on tap.  Hail Mad Mex!",

It was huge and involved some other greens so it wasn't too rough as kale can be. We got the trio of dips. Watch out for the queso if you don't like spicy. I happen to like spicy. Definitely caters to vegetarians and special needs eaters. Tofu is an option. I ordered a tortilla soup, but they forgot it. Still, the service was pretty good -- attentive. This restaurant is part of a small chain which also includes Kaya, at which I ate the night before. Pretty happy with both places. The only thing I didn't like was that I didn't see if corn tortillas were offered, which I prefer 99% of the time.",

My wife and I had our first date, 12 years ago to the day, at the Oakland location. So, once we had finished our meal, Joe came by with a menu and informed us that dessert was on the house. Sopapillas, long weekend style, for the win. Thank you Joe, and Mad Mex!",

I enjoy the atmosphere it's not as college like but it's the same quality food and large margaritas. At first I thought it was weird going to a Mexican restaurant for wings but omg they're so delicious that I've just accepted it. Usually I'm a little boujee and try to go for boneless wings but I wouldn't recommend it. Get messy and eat the ones with the bone in. I haven't found a sauce at Mad Mex that I didn't like. Also their big margaritas are amazing. I also recommend the shrimp burritos and their French fries. I could inhale their French fries. Also let's talk about the service. The people here are always so hospitable and I appreciate they at least pretend to like their jobs. I'm glad a Mad Mex isn't that close to me as I would hang out here all the time and my waist doesn't need that.",

It's not that the wings were dry, or lacking sauce, it was almost like national lampoons Christmas vacation when they cut the turkey open.   Almost just like that. Except the smell, that's from Shadyside.   The pick a dip with guacamole/queso/bean dip is a solid starter. Add a tequila sampler and some pints at happy hour and pleasant vibes are created. The crab quesadilla was pretty good as well.   Nice energy on this, a great wodins day in the summer. Great staff for the most part. That's the real strength of any successful business.",

Wait times are very unpredictable, though, so if you don't go on a more quiet night, you could be waiting for awhile (and probably outside because the foyer is so very small!)  Last time we were here we were seated upstairs. I thought this would be cool but it actually just seemed to result in slower service. I would request seating downstairs if the wait time isn't crazy.

    "text": "Four years ago, this Mad Mex was one of the first local restaurants we had tried in Pittsburgh while family was in town. The service had been mediocre, the food was underwhelming, and the margaritas were poor. My margarita was so terrible that I sent it back. (That's the one and only time that I have ever sent a drink back.) I avoided eating at Mad Mex for two years until I gave the Monroeville location a try. After drinking and dining at the Monroeville location multiple times over the last couple years, I fell in love with this local Mexican chain.    While in the middle of some bar hopping last night, my group and I made Mad Mex our last stop. I had such high hopes after our Monroeville experience... but I was disappointed yet again. We started with appetizers which were pretty good. However, our waitress was not the nicest. We arrived at 9:30, and several people at the table ordered beer while I anxiously waited for the Big Azz Margarita special to begin at 10:00. At 9:58, I asked the waitress if it was 10:00 yet, and she curtly answered \"no\" and walked away, not returning for at least 10-15 minutes. I was so frustrated by her that none of us ordered margaritas, and we all ended up leaving the restaurant shortly after.   My advice would be to drive out to the suburbs and dine at the Mad Mex in Monroeville, where I have consistently had a completely opposite experience.",

ANYWAY - Mad Mex is just fabulous...even moreso in the fall when the all-important Gobblerito takes centerstage and fills my belly with an entire Thanksgiving meal swaddled in a delightful flourly shell.  Aside from the Gobblerito, MM has plenty to offer year-round, include those of us who love a good vegetarian meal when they're not scarfing down turkey by the pound.  MM's menu is a delight to every Tex-Mex palate and their wings aren't too bad either.

The Mad Maria (Bloody Mary with Tequila) was a nice twist from the standard drink and was the right amount of spicy.

I realize it is a bar/mexican restaurant, but if they are going to make desserts so poorly they should take them off of the menu. Also, the edge of the plate looked to be dirty.   I was there during happy hour.  The service was prompt. They have a good selection of beer. If I were to return to Mad Mex, I would go for drink specials and nothing else.   The patio looks nice in the summer if you're looking to have a drink in the sun.",

He spilled a drink on me, didn't clea it up or even bring extra napkins so I could take care of it myself. He brought my brother-in-law a half empty soda, charged us full price. Charged us for the drink he spilled on me. My sister ate one bite of her meal and wanted to send it back but the waiter was no where to be found until ::surprise:: the check was ready to be given. He took it out of our hands so quickly, and after about 5 minutes and not having brought our cards back to us, we spoke to the manager. The waiter was confused as to why we asked for the manager. He didn't think he did anything wrong! Insanity. The manager offered us free entree cards and we declined. Never returning.",

    "text": "I went here with a dozen friends shortly after Mad Mex Shadyside opened. Being used to the Oakland one where one could get an impressively stiff margarita on an undergraduate budget, we all ordered margaritas and dinners, some opting for a floater.  While the margaritas were palatable, outside of the floater there was so little tequila or triple sec that it was unclear whether or not the drinks were actually alcoholic. Further, the floaters were a dismal half to a third of a shot. As far as any of us can tell, we paid $10 for a half shot of tequila and 20 ounces of non-alcoholic mix.  The food was good as is the food at all Big Burrito restaurants I've been to, but I think next time I want a margarita I'll either mix it myself or try one of the many other fine bars in Shadyside.",

    "text": "I moved to Pittsburgh from the Southwest and have not yet found any decent Mexican food. While I was wary of Mad Mex due to reading reviews, some coworkers insisted that I try it anyway and spoke highly of it, so I did. We ordered nachos and a carnitas burrito. The nachos were just not made well, structurally speaking. They were big and had lots of toppings, but the cheese wasn't distributed evenly at all, and wasn't a nice melty cheese sauce. It was also overcooked so it was just kind of like dried cheese on some chips with lots of cheese-less chips. The other toppings were okay but nothing amazing. The burrito was really sad. It looked like a square on the plate, not like any burrito I've ever seen before. The filling was almost entirely rice, which was okay tasting by itself, but there was way too much in the burrito. The carnitas were extremely salty to the point that I didn't even finish the meat. There were a few trace amounts of green in the bottom of the tortilla (I guess that was the advertised \"green chile\"), but they had almost no flavor or spice so it was hard to distinguish them. On the side was a flavorless pico de gallo and slaw, and some cornbread that was really mushy in the middle (undercooked). Overall, not impressed and not going back unless it's just for drinks.",

    "text": "It's Mad Mex. If you've been living in Pittsburgh for at least a month or so, you probably know what you're getting into already. Although this location can't quite rival the spacious Mad Mex Happy Valley that I grew accustomed to in college, it's still pretty impressive with a large bar and lots of tables, and the open garage door makes up for the lack of patio and provides for awesome people watching. The absolute best part though is that it's virtually across the street from my apartment! So I mean, I'd probably come here even if it was sub-par...(please don't stalk me, yelpers...haha)  For anyone who's not familiar with Mad Mex...the food is nothing to rave about. Typical Tex Mex that tends to taste better after a few drinks (especially the hugeeee plate of nachos). Their wings, surprisingly, are excellent and in my opinion the standout of the menu (get bleu cheese, not ranch. their bleu cheese is addictive). Mostly though, I come here for the margarita special. Doesn't everyone? I get really excited about the monthly flavors. My favorite is honeydew...June can't come soon enough! And if you're not in the mood for tequila, the beer list is pretty solid.  It wouldn't be on my list of considerations for dinner, but I'd definitely recommend it for a place to chill, talk, and drink a little (or a lot) more than you planned to.",

We had a few beers each from the very impressive draft menu with chips and queso for starters. After starters we both ordered the chicken chickpea burritos, which were big and boring. All and all it wasn't my kind of place.  It was full of dudes on the prowl and blasting loud music, which made it hard to communicate with anyone. The food wasn't amazing, but it was good enough for the price, especially when you consider the portion sizes. Service was on point. The best part was definitely the beer selection, but seeing as there's a 45 minute wait on a wednesday and it's full of dude-bros, I probably won't be back anytime soon. Oh, and there's a free valet, just in case you're into that sort of thing.",

I really love a restaurant that takes into account other people's dietary needs and Mad Mex really does. They even have a vegan dessert on the menu now! My fiance and I went here over the weekend. I had the crispy tofu tacos-- they were out of this world good! My blackberry rhubarb frozen margarita was good, but my man's frozen mango one was better. I'll get that instead the next time I'm there. This place is ALWAYS slamming busy every time we go-- I think to myself every time I walk in, \"Man, they must be raking in some serious dough!\" I bet they are! The decor doesn't pretend to be authentically Mexican and is really fun.

    "text": "I've been waiting to review this Mex since it opened right by mi casa.  I've already been there dozens of times...  I was there with the masses on opening night, and I even chose it over Casbah for my graduation (unorthodox, I know).  But my experiences last night pushed me into writing the review.  I showed up with my guy friends who were being a little rowdy, but the service from the hosts, the waitress, and the bartender was excellent.  Our waitress was so nice that she let us keep our table for a full hour after the dining area closed, without complaining.  Of course, once we realized that we were supposed to have moved to the bar by then, we closed our enormous tab with her.  Kudos.  Every time I've been to this Mex, the service has been friendly and fun--the wait staff edges on flirty and likes dress in themes relating to this week's celebrity hot mess (last night was Ke$ha).  It's entertaining.  As far as the food goes, I'm totally aware that this is not legit Mexican, Tex-Mex, or Cali-Mex.  It's Penna-Mex.  Which I'm totally okay with; it appeals to my bland palate.  I could eat the chicken Mad Mex Quesadilla--the most unoriginality titled item on the menu--every day.   The beer selection ranges from seasonals (pumpkins, harvests, Oktoberfests) to locals (East End, Penn) to unique (whatever the hot microbrewery of the moment is--Great Lakes, Brooklyn) to the decent standards (Blue Moon).  Recently, I've tried the Brooklyn Oktoberfest and Southern Tier Pumpkin, and I liked both.  The liquor varies from top shelf to bottom of the barrel, and the pours are weak.  That leaves the margaritas.  Mad Mex Big Azz margs and I go way back to the days of living in South Oakland when we'd sit on my friend's porch across the street and try to figure out the perfect time to show up to take advantage of both the marg special and the half-price student special.  After a summer in Texas, I'm no longer a big fan of the frozen margarita, but I love a good marg on the rocks.  Unfortunately, the Big Azz on the rocks is not something one can drink without furrowed brows and puckered lips.  But, yes, it will get you drunk in a hurry if you can't afford one of the top shelf margs.  The atmosphere is the best of the Mex here.  It's kitschy.  But the larger bar area and the garage door side make up of the silliness of the decor.  Tip: If you go on a weekend, you can use the FREE valet for Casbah across the street (both are owned by Big Burrito).  The cost of the tip is probably worth avoiding the frustration of circling around Shadyside for a nonexistent parking spot.",

I have a gluten allergy and when an order came with the pork marinated with beer, which wasn't mentioned on the menu, (tastes awesome, but will kill me) the waiter offered to get me a different order. He was really nice, and I ordered chicken instead, thanked him profusely. The new order looked like someone had just dumped ingredients in a pile, chicken was dry and flavorless. Later in the evening, he came by and actually stood with his back to me and faced my friend to ask him how everything was, and not me. Refused to refill our water. I tipped over 20% on our total order to show my appreciation for his extra help, despite the weirdness -- totally understand that allergies can be annoying for wait staff. When he put our extra food in a box, he dumped everything upside down. I would recommend using caution with this one. I've had fine experiences here in the past, but this was a deal breaker for me.",

Well... first of all, that huge open space? Somehow no air gets in. It's so stagnate in there! Please, get some fans going or something. Second, I think the hostesses are still working out how to seat people. They shoved everyone in this long bench area while nice booths were sitting there empty.  Finally the food was seriously Meh. My shrimp were cooked to a rubbery car tire consistency. Now, the plus is that they have great drink and food specials, so I suggest eating past 11pm when food is 1/2 off and drinking past 10pm when Big Azz Margaritas are $7.",
