    "text": "Red Robinnnn   [YUMMMMMMMM]    Sorry... it had to be done!    Anyhow, this one is very much like all of the other Red Robins out there!  Located inside of the South Hills Village Mall (at the former location of The Roxy Restaurant), its quite smallish inside for a Red Robin location.  It can be absolutely nuts on the weekends with families trying to get a table for 7 on a Saturday night, so steer clear of it on weekend nights!  The food was average, at best, and of the same quality standards as all other Red Robin locations (which sits at \"just below average\").  Burgers and chicken sandwiches are the main event here, though there are some salads and Roast Beef Au Jus sandwiches, too.  Service was very friendly today (7/9/11), but there was no pre-bus which is a huuuuuuge issue for me!  I want those dead soldier dishes taken away from my table ASAP and hate it when restaurants/servers fail to deliver (or remove, as it were). We also sat with our check (ready to pay) for quite some time before our server finally took our card for us.  The Breakdown PROS: Food Quality is Consistent to all other locations; Service was Friendly (though the hostess staff was pretty disorganized); Refill service was fantastic!  CONS: NO Pre-Bus!   GRRRRRRRR! Failed to cash out our check in a timely manner (we seriously sat for a looooooong time to get outa there!)  FOOD RECOMMENDATION? I liked the Roast Beef Au Jus Sandwich (mentioned earlier)! The meat was good quality and not gross at all.  The bun was nice and chewy.  The Au Jus coulda been a bit more flavorful, however.  [sorry, though I usually try to comment on the facilities, I didn't use the bathroom in this location.]",

If I'm jonesing for a sub-par burger, a Whopper from Burger King suffices and it's a quarter the price. The atmosphere is chaotic but the kids love it so I'll bump it a star.  If I had to compare it against Five Guys and Fuddruckers, I'd say Five Guys burgers taste the best, Fuddruckers gives you the best customization, and Red Robin is a blase third place.",

Negatives: It is loud in here (although that's not always a negative if you have kids). There's always a wait unless you go at a really wacky time.

I'd definitely go to this Red Robin again when I'm craving some burger action.  This place is fairly new so everything is clean and the wait staff is very attentive - let's hope these aspects withstand the test of time.",

There is a bar, which has been at 100% capacity both times, but you are able to walk up and order a drink while you wait. The hostess did this for us on our first visit, which I thought was an excellent and surprising level of service. The burgers are fantastic---SO many to choose from! I've always gotten the bacon cheeseburger...call me predictable. But I know what I like. Bacon. Burger cooked to your doneness preference (pink/no pink) served with endless fries. Food arrives quickly and served by whomever is available near the kitchen when the order is put in the pass. I think that makes SO much sense! Manager-types aplenty asking if everything is ok, willing to refill drinks and run for napkins (you'll need them) Reasonable price $15 or less/person. The service and the burgers both are outstanding",

How is it on a early Thursday evening, (before 5p.m.) your food is cold, rubbery, and unappetizing?   My daughter ordered the Chophouse BG, and I got the Cod Fish & Chips, the fries were cold, and not thoroughly cooked. The fish were 4 fist sized chunks of cold, tough, and not crispy, or crunchy pieces of bland.  Fish & Chips for $12.99, cook it right, or take it off the menu, and stick to burgers.   Our server was slower than the cold patch crew for potholes. She was either having a hard time juggling her tables, or just the typical representative of this Red Robin.  Previous trips were average, but I guess there's a reason to why our visits happen sparsely over the years. So much so, I threw away my Royalty Programs card.",

The bleach blonde waitress (only gave a description so others can avoid her) went to take a plate off the table and spilled half a 22 oz beer all over my clothes. Pants, shirt, and jacket all covered. Then then says \"I guess thats your que to go\" as if it was my fault.  Then asked if I would like a replacement beer. I said that would at least be nice. She comes back with a beer 1/4 filled and walks away without another word. Nothing offered to compensate the fact that I was covered in alcohol that she spilled on me, except for her giving me less beer than what she spilled in the first place.  I have been here at least twice a month for 6 years. I'll never go back. I wish she didnt ruin this restaurant for me. But that was the worse customer service I've ever experienced. If that's how they are trained. I don't recommend.",

I have a feeling they are cutting back on the ingredients quality, but that is just my opinion. The pineapple on the Banzai burger seemed less than proper. And now they have these new little kiosk monitors on the tables remove your server from the dining experience. After the meal, we got our check and the server took the check and giftcards we were paying with and returned the receipts for the giftcards. No check. We had no idea how much of the giftcards were applied. And then, the server was nowhere to be found, I would rather drive to Washington (25 minutes) than go to this location (5 minutes).

    "text": "We have always loved Red Robin and haven't been in awhile.  We went with friends and had a great waitress, Kristen.  Super friendly and helped us out when one of our burgers didn't arrive with everything it was supposed to have on it. She told us that they had a newer chef, but the problem was immediately rectified.  The only issue we really had was that she never asked us whether we were loyalty members, which we are, and we needed to pay our check with the little table kiosk in order to get the 20% military discount. We had to turn the machine on and thankfully since we had been before it wasn't an issue for us to log in and pay the check that way and get our discount.  My husband and I went with 2 of their newer burgers, the Mad Love (pricey at $14.49) and the Southern Charm($13.99).  His was the burger missing the onions which we did receive later, and mine was loaded with bacon, crispy cheese and avocado.  I loved mine and he was very happy with how his tasted as well.  Lots of goodness on those 2 babies.  Yum.  Overall we were once again happy with choosing RR.  Will be back again for sure.",

    "text": "Oh red robin. I just try so hard to like you but I just find you oh so boring.   Story- when my boyfriend and I started dating , red robin was his FAVORITE place to go. If I wanted to treat him, he wanted to come here. I tried tons of items on their menu and just never loved anything. Eventually, he broke away from his red robin obsession and moved onto chilli's (another place I just do not like, lol).   Him and I haven't been to a red robin in over a year- until yesterday. I was so hungry I didn't care where we went, so when he suggested red robin I figured why not? Although my memories of red robin consisted of bland chicken sandwiches and bland fries that are too large and just aren't very good in general- I figured I could find something I enjoyed.   Eh. First off, this location is always busy on the weekends. It's in the mall, so it's usually packed. Especially now that it's holiday season. We came around 3 on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy, which was nice.   I ordered a strawberry lemonade because I remembered they had good ones. Should have looked at the price first.. $5 for sugar water with frozen strawberries.. Why?! It was good don't get me wrong.. But $5? I'll skip it next time.   We ordered queso dip for an appetizer.. Honestly, this was the tastiest item we had. There was chunks of tomatoes and other vegetables and meat in the queso and I just devoured it. And for $5 it wasn't a bad deal.   I ordered the soup and salad combo figuring that there's no way they could mess it up. Eh. The French onion soup was ok- the onions weren't cooked enough though and the cheese that was melted on top was entirely too thick. The broth was decent though. The salad was miniature.. And their croutons just tasted, off. Their balsamic also tasted just odd.   My boyfriend likes their burgers, which is what they are \"famous\" for. I never tried one.   I hope his red robin fix will be satisfied for at least another year. Just another disappointing chain.",

This visit, I ordered the Whiskey River BBQ Burger- burger, bbq sauce cheddar cheese, crispy onion straws, lettuce, tomatoes & mayo. I found it to be really good. They also had the same choice with a grilled chicken sandwich   Bobby ordered the Prime Chophouse Burger which looked delicious. I can't remember what my sister had for dinner, but she ordered French Onion Soup beforehand. I tried the soup- very good! Sometimes not all French onion soup is tasty!   For drinks, I ordered \"Sand in Your Shorts. It had  Chambord, vodka, Peach Schnapps, Midori, triple sec, o.j., cranberry juice & sweet 'n sour. It was tasty, not very strong though. My sister ordered a frozen strawberry margarita & Bobby ordered Reb Robin's version of a Long Island.. I forget the name :)  Next time I'm going to order a Bottomless Root Beer Float. I'm pretty sure those are the most amazing 4 words that a can be next to each other in a sentence.",

My mom got the same thing. Both burgers came. They had bacon (nobody wanted bacon but I figured maybe they all cam that way), and tomato. Not one piece of onion and not one pickle. The worst was they were so black, hard as a rock and BURNT, they were inedible! I sent it back and told her again how I wanted it. I said \"let's try pink\".....still black, hard as a rock and terrible!! She threw a few pickles in a cup for us. WTH? This place isn't cheap. What is so hard about a regular hamburger.

Went on Sunday, and yes the restaurant was crowded.  If it's understaffed, then that's a management problem.  But our waitress was obviously in a rush the whole time.  She'd set something down on the table and quickly turn and leave, before we could ask for anything else.  She didn't check on us, and was avoiding eye contact when we were trying to flag her down.  It really affected our meal - we had just taken the kids to see Santa at the mall, and I was looking forward to a nice lunch.  Will look for somewhere else next time.",

Face it, how hard is it to put tequila and triple sec in with some cocktail mix....  Then I ordered boneless wings. She asked if I wanted ranch or blue cheese. I said BC please especially if it came with celery. She said she would make sure mine did.   About 15 min later, crusty hard, half cold nuggets of chicken came out. Sucky tasting. No surprise.... And of course, the curdled looking blue cheese was not accompanied with celery. She sure did make sure. The place was slow, no surprise again, and she never even noticed. Frankly she couldn't care a bit.  WONT BE BACK!!!! Crap spot, crap service, crap food...",

My girlfriend and I came to sit down and get work done, banking on the utility of the bottomless fries along with the rest of our 30$ meal, but after not too long, in response to me asking for only our 3rd refill of supposedly bottomless fries, the waitress (Lisa) said, \"C'mon guys, you've been here for three hours and you're taking up my tables\". Never have I received service similar to that, especially when I was handed the check and was told \"take your time\". There were multiple open tables around us and there was no line, yet the service still tried to push us out the door, when we actually still planned on ordering milkshakes within minutes of the remark. Expect to come for quality food, but also to leave with a quality kick out the door.",

We had a rather large lunch. We started with the chips served with guac and salsa. The salsa was on the spicy side, which I'd prefer. The guac was good. Not too bland and not too salty.     We had 4 entrees. The bacon cheese burger, with two pieces of large thick bacon and American cheese. The crispy chx tender salad, served with egg, bacon, cheese and tomato. The salad was a modest size, but tasty. The whiskey river BBQ chx wrap, with lettuce tomato. The whiskey sauce was sweet with a little bit of a pepper taste. It was a big wrap and very yummy. The kids order of corn dog bite was plentiful, with 5 pieces of the dogs and a cup of fruit for our choice of side. The refill of fries was generous.      For desert, we chose two. The mountain high mudd pie was huge! It was a giant piece of ice cream cake with the top layer of chocolate ice cream and a cookie crum middle with the bottom layer of ice cream as cookies and cream. The crust was a chocolate cookie crust. It was topped with a generous amount of whipped cream with a chocolate and caramel drizzle! Yum! The second was the gooey chocolate brownie cake. The cake was topped with a warm chocolate syrup and a side of vanilla ice cream with strawberries supposed to have been on top, but my kid wanted it on the side.      The experience was great. I feel very satisfied with the service and food and my tummy is happy!",

If their bottomless them when your finished the should ask you if you Like more ? My one thing also bottomless was an orange cream soda The menu said this delicious drink -they put ice on top whip cream which made it hard to stir in- what they should do mix it at bar with ice drain then whip cream so you can mix it in better  yourself! I didn't get a bottomless cream orange soda either? My lunch friend got her 2 raspberry cream one but I got 0-? Maybe we disabled are invisible to Red Robin staff? Its hard to eat out in wheelchair but the menu said bottomless drinks and fries and you should get them! other places like Sesame inn and  Bone fish treat disabled people nice and respectful- Red Robin Your staff needs to take courses on what the menus says& we should be asked would you care for another order of bottomless fries too!     6-3-2017 I want to thank all the staff at Red Robin at A Hills Village Mall.!

This restaurant refused to let my friend and me order from the kids menu, however every other time I dined there, with any OTHER waitress they did. Our waitress Crystal, let visibly an adult order off of the kids menu but came back to us (12 year olds) and said she would get fired if she let us order off the kids menu. I felt very cornered and discriminated against. Is this how you treat young girls in the age of #metoo? We had our own money and should've been able to order a smaller portion of a meal if we pleased. They should be glad they are getting customers a. Then she ordered us to leave because I stated that online it says adults could order off of the kids menu. Crystal was our waitress before and gave me dirty looks each time she came to wait on my mom, dad, and I. I am very upset as I used to enjoy Red Robin's. In addition to this upsetting service, at the front I saw a man getting harassed by the manager which really upset and scared me. If you do happen to have Crystal wait on you, I advise you ask for a different waitress. Red Robin has terrible customer service and needs to update their website before they accuse you of being wrong. I will be taking my service elsewhere and advise you do the same.",

    "text": "I've still gotta lay into the chain-haters over Red Robin, 'cause I can't say that there's a single thing wrong with their burgers! And this was evident yesterday when Kay found herself with a coupon for a free burger for her birthday month.   The DGB (Damn Great Burger) is one of RR's newest inventions and features oven-roasted tomatoes, a roasted garlic aioli, an on-board mini-salad of fresh arugala dressed in a citrus-infused olive oil and a toasted, flour-dusted ciabatta bun. Tasty and exceedingly tidy thanks to the absorbent and sturdy ciabatta, the DGB's mildly charred and nicely seasoned patty was cooked to a fine mid-rare while the tomatoes brought a sweet smack to counter the tart arugala. I added pepperjack cheese to ramp up the twang a little, but the rich and piquant mayonnaise not only had a say in the matter, it nearly made the burger. I don't know how RR does it, but they do it well. Nothing about the burger tasted processed or flash frozen.   Look, it ain't BRGR. Red Robin operates at a different level and price point, but for a chain, I can't say RR puts out a crummy burger at all, and hell, they're even creative about them.   The \"Bottomless\" fries are another matter. While not an abomination in the eyes of Demeter, there is something a little bland about them, but their house seasoning is on every table to remedy that. Let's say I usually don't ask for seconds.   And wouldn't you know that my very first brush with the doughssaint/cronut craze happened in a suburban Red Robin franchise? RR calls 'em Towering Doh Rings and serve 'em in quantities of 4 or 8, all of 'em rung around a thin metal pole like horseshoes at a family reunion. What to say about them? They live up to their hype and description. What they really remind me of, though, are those sugary doughnut balls that American Chinese joints often sell. Or Indian batura bread? They had the fluffy/crispy texture I expected, and unexpectedly, two dipping sauces: Hot fudge and a sort of raspberry puree (remember that Prince song?) I surprisingly leaned towards the tangy berry juice, savoring each puffy, oily morsel as it was coated in saccharine grit.   Another odd and even newer dessert RR is offering these days is called Chocolate Fruffles. RR calls them \"soft fudge brownies,\" but they're more like cold, flat candy bars topped with sea salt and sugar crystals. These too come with a berry dipping sauce. Eh, I might have enjoyed them more if I'd been eating them inside the nearby Carmike Theater, but passable they were.   Hey, they take chances and thus take my dollars.   Oh, the service wasn't bad either.  P.S. The guac 'n chips we had as a starter would give Mad Mex's version a good match anytime.",

    "text": "Red Robin is probably hands down one of my favorite chain restaurants. However the one in the village is pretty bad. The service is less than desirable. I was meeting a friend and told the host that they were sat already and instead of taking me to the table just told me in so many words that I could look around for them. Actually those were the words. Then our server didn't smell very pleasant. I won't say her name bc it's embarrassing but it's not really appetizing to have your server stink. Our appetizers and meals were put in at the same time so they of course came out at the same time which was annoying. Then my sandwich was mad and at that point I was just irritated and ate my super soggy \"crispy\" chicken sandwich! This is not the first time I've had a poor experience there. But this may have been my breaking point.",

    "text": "You know how a bad first impression can ruin your whole experience?  That happened here and left a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended).  Having a family day usually means having to negotiate where to eat at some point in the day.  Being at South Hills Village meant we had choices but we really didn't want to eat in the food court.  Opting for Red Robin seemed like a great idea at the time.  We had waited until the lunchtime rush had ended to head that way.  My parents went ahead to put our name in and allow them time to prepare a table for our large party.  In all there were nine of us total, not too big of a party, but one that would have you moving tables around to accommodate.  It took us a few minutes to catch up to my parents as we headed to the car to drop of bags and packages from purchasing items in the mall.    When we finally did arrive we were told we would be seated next and it shouldn't be long, they were currently clearing/cleaning the table.  Ten minutes pass, no big deal.  Fifteen minutes pass, they must be waiting for the table to dry.  Twenty minutes pass, OK we need to know what's going on.  All the while there are parties coming in after us being seated immediately.  Of course they are smaller parties, but this was getting ridiculous.  I approached the hostess desk to inquiring how much longer and was kind of given this brushed off attitude.  I asked a question and expected an answer.  Basically being ignored I just stared at the two teenagers working the stand until one of them must of asked a manager.  We were told just a few more minutes, they were still waiting for the party sitting in the area to clear out.  Wait?  What?  How?  You told us at the beginning of this you were getting it ready.  How is there still a party sitting in our area then?  When we finally did get shown to our seats the teenage girl from the hostess stand just threw the menus on the table and left.  Was it too hard in your life to hand each of us our menu and tell us who our server would be?  Did your parents force you to get this job instead of giving you everything you want?  Or are you just a sad bag of garbage of a person?  Things really did not turn around enough after that.  Food was what I expected.  I had the fried pickles as an appetizer and the Royal Red Robin Burger as my main course.  Cooked the way it was supposed to be to my liking.    Our server was a dear, but with that sour taste in my mouth from the beginning it put this haze over the whole interaction from that point on.  I really wasn't happy at all here and begrudgingly stayed because where else would a party of nine storm out to?",

Being a burger-boy, I ordered the new Monster Burger, No pink with everything, the garlic fries and we got the pretzels as our appetizer. Pretzels were good, typical restaurant quality. But the fun started when our meal arrived and none of my toppings came on the burger. On top of that, my associates chicken sandwich had no mayonnaise, and my garlic fries were just regular fries. Bad start to a meal for sure, but how did it taste? Pretty good actually, and my associates meals were great as well. Overall, terrible service and they got our order wrong, but great food.

Their menu is a lot smaller and they got rid of my beloved cheese curds!    We got standard burgers and both chose to upgrade our fries to chili cheese fries. It was delicious!! Totally worth the extra couple bucks.  The fries upgrade makes them not bottomless, but we didn't need one anyway! We left completely stuffed.   Our food was great but we did not get our appetizer - Cheese Sticks and Breaded Zucchini on the Jump Starter Double, until after our meal arrived. One word of advice - do not get the zucchini! It was cut into large spears and the what was left of the breading tasted like a funnel cake. At least 50% of each spear had no breading, and it just tasted like you bit into a hunk of boiled zucchini.  Red Robin is our go-to place. Even with the zucchini hiccup, we will be back!",

This isn't a huge concern of mine though.  This visit, I ordered the new Smoke & Pepper burger because I LOVE PEPPER. Our waitress was very prompt on helping us and starting us with drinks. Now, she asked if I wanted some pink or no pink. I always say some pink because as excepted, it's usually more cooked than I prefer. There was no pink at all. It was a little dry, but not terrible. You just would think for a $13 burger they could at least not overcook it. The bacon was a little chewy and the pickles were very flimsy (I like when they're crunchy).  Overall, I did enjoy the burger, but to me it's not worth $13. We went because we had gift cards and didn't feel like cooking dinner. The staff was very friendly and fast, just the food itself was meh. I'm sure I'll return in the future though because I'm a sucker for their fries.",

After seating there was a tablet that was not working on the table so I'm not sure what that was for everyone else's seem to work. Eventually the bar girl came over I asked for a water and that was fast but then she disappeared for a good 15 mins before coming back to ask me for my Order. Next I order the a1 peppercorn burger i think was the name. I asked for some pink as she would ask how I wanted it cooked and later on someone else new brought out my food and the bar tender was still gone. I cut my burger open and it's way over cooked kinda dry. I was disappointed and I just kinda sucked it up cause the bar tender was taking forever and I was in a rush. The fries where very sawgy so I asked for another basket being there bottomless and those weren't much  better. I feel bad because there was another guy at the bar sitting who you could tell was getting frustrated because the lack of service and staff being no where to be found.

While the burgers at Red Robin are not on the level of the top places in Pittsburgh, they are well above average compared to other chains.  The burgers are fresh and cooked to your liking.  The A1 Peppercorn burger has been one of my favorite burgers for a very long time.  The onion strings, peppercorn sauce, and onion bun are a great combination that always leaves you wanting more.  Each burger also comes with bottomless fries which is a nice touch.  I also really enjoy their appetizers.  Their mozzarella sticks are some of the best around.",

I've only visited a few of these restaurants, but every time I do- I'm surprised by the quality and amount of food for which I pay.  Our server was quick to respond to every request, and the decorations were great conversation starters. For example, if you sit right by the kitchen doors, which I know is typically a bad idea for ambiance, you will get to see a contrast of different artwork. I was greeted by a print of the well-known classic painting, 'American Gothic' & and an adaptation with Lego figurines.  The 'Mile High Mud Pie' is a great desert to cap off your meal too.  This place is definitely a good choice among the available fare in this area.",

I usually avoid RR as they tend to be grossly inconsistent and this location is no exception.  Upon arrival, 20 minutes sitting at table.  Asked twice if I could order.  Server arrives and takes my Chophouse burger order which basically is burger with mushrooms.  Added an order of onion rings also.  The burger only took 15 minutes, which was fine.  The burger itself not so great: the buns were soggy and everything had a mushy texture.  The onion rings helped a bit.    Trying to call a server to let him know or anyone for that matter was near impossible.  I finally gave up and walked over to the bar, the bartender had the worst look as though she hated her job with a passion.  Not only did she look that way, she displayed one of the worst disgusted looks I have ever seen as I attempted to ask her the question.  After another 12 minutes, I stopped a another waitress who refused to turn around and acknowledge me as I worked hard to explain to her about the birthday burger.  She said under her breath, \"yeah, I got it\" as she stormed on by.  Another 12 minutes flew by with absolutely no action.  My other half went up to the bar again to ask, this time the male manager and bartender both blew a gasket and berated her for asking again.   Finally, a full 30+ minutes later the server stops by claiming a six top occupied all his time.  Not only that, he was not informed to comp my birthday burger so spent yet another 10 minutes to fix.    Food and Customer Service?  Non-existent with management staff that further perpetuates that culture.  Zero stars - I want my time and money back.     \"Happy B day, Ken, from RR!\"",

It's inside the South Hills Village Mall which is upscale but the people here are ghetto?  This location is always more dirty than the others. The floors are dirty, my seat and table had food on it, my table computer was broke, they forgot my special ketchup flavors, service was a little slow........... That's all",

    "text": "Why did they change the menu I asked when we were seated? The red, white and blue salad was one of my favorites. The waitress replied that it was a popular salad but they just decided to change it.  The other major menu change is your salad and soup pairing. You can now only pair a tossed salad with soup. Any other salad is considered a full meal portion salad. So I opted new bonsai salad and ordered a cup of french onion soup as a side. The soup came in a small square bowl. The salad was full sized but nothing to give a hoot about.  FYI They have not removed the soup and sandwich pairing so I guess I'll have to go that route next time.  Service was good and they did save me money by using my rewards card.  Sometimes it is better not to change a popular menu item for something not as exciting.",

    "text": "I had not eaten at Red Robin in a while and then ended up there 2 times in a week's time. My first visit I ordered Ensanada Chicken. I ordered black beans as my side. You have the option of ordering one or 2 pieces of chicken. I got 2 thinking I would take one home for leftovers. Well, it was so good that I ate both pieces of chicken. The beans were really tasty too.  The second visit I got a burger with blue cheese, steak sauce, and onion straws. I ordered it Medium. I ordered Cole slaw as my side. The burger was cooked exactly as I requested it. I liked the coleslaw and found out it's \"endless\" like their fries are. That's a great deal. I don't know anywhere else that offers endless sides.  Both times the servers were kind and did a nice job. I would definitely go back.",
