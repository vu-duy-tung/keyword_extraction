As unhealthy as this greasy and salty meal can be for you (in addition to the sugar from the soda that you'll probably get), this pizza is immensely satisfying and just so good. Having one slice is enough to satisfy any pizza craving for a long time.",

We ordered a small Hawaiian and grabbed some beers. The small is more than enough for two people. Aiello's puts on ample toppings - this one had pineapple, ham and bacon. What was most notable to me was that the crust was crisp which was absolutely delicious especially with a few air bubbles. Even after sitting for a couple of minutes, the middle of the pie held up and did not get soggy. Also some of the bacon had some crunchiness and wasn't buried in cheese. Major points for me.  The staff were friendly and laid back however Aiello's is cash only. They have an ATM in the store.   I'll be back but not before trying Mineo's.",

If one of the owners is working the pizza is amazing and is easily a 5 but if they are not the quality drops significantly. It makes me want to call and ask who is working before placing an order because the experience can drastically differ. I can't give less then a 4 because I have walked out with amazing pizza but unfortunately it doesn't happen every time.",

The staff was friendly and very personable.  They directed us to their favorite pizza and helped us to make a good choice.  I got their margarita pizza and later found out that the owner picks the ingredients daily to make this pizza so it's nice and fresh from the garden.  My partner got the stuffed pizza and we were worried that it might be to filling but it was just right.  The top was crunchy and had a nice sprinkle of cheese and the meat filling wasn't jam packed with meat but had just the right amount.  The crust was nice and thin and had a good crisp to it.    I can't wait to go back here again, to bad they aren't down the street from our apartment.  But I think that if it was we would be the size of a house and the only exercise I would get would be walking to the store to pick up my pizza.    A MUST TRY!!!",

I tried Minoe's and then, to be fair, cleaned my palete with a fine wash down of Dr. Peper before walking over to Aiello's to compare. I did this partially to piss of the girlfriend because she is a staunch Mineo's fan and was near vomiting when she walked in to Aiello's.  What I determined: Aiello's is basically like Billy Baldwin and Mineo's is Alec Baldwin. I mean they are still Baldwins but at least Alec can act and isn't a total wiener.  The pizza tasted like junk. The peperoni sucked, the cheese sucked, the crust sucked. I couldn't even finish it. I immediately walked back over to Mineo's and had another slice of their delicious pizza heaven.     Marion's in Dayton, Ohio is the best pizza in the world to settle the argument.",

The salad I ordered came in a plastic container and was served with a packet of dressing, flimsy utensils, and a paper plate.  The meatball hoagie was poor.  The roll, sauce, and cheese were hot but the meatballs were cool in the center as if they were taken out of the fridge and put directly in the oven without enough time to heat through.  The pizza sauce is very sweat and lacking in the cheese that really used to make these pies great.  I had to clean off my own table and the staff calls you up when your order is ready.  The staff seemed bored and at 8pm on a Sat. night the place was nearly empty......3 occupied booths.  It was an unfortunate experience considering that when the original owner was there the food and staff were much better.  Lots of other choices in this area and I will not be returning to Aiello's.",

One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than True NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.  The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites: Fiori's Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch) Pizza Perfectta Aiello's (Murray Street) Beto's  Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.  \"Cuts\" (Pittsburgh speak for \"slices\") are small but they are also priced a little cheaper than the average pizza place.  There's seating in the back if you're not taking out.",

Having lived in NYC for the last 8 years, I can tell you that while the ingredients for pizza were present, the food that I put in my mouth last night was not, in fact, pizza.   First, the crust was so mushy that when I lifted my slice it actually fell apart! Forget not holding firm for me to bite it, the main part of the slice actually separated from the crust.  Then there was the bland cheese and watered down sauce. If I didn't know better, I would have called this a congealed and tasteless soup.  Bleh!",

After finding one gift for my Dad we decided to get some lunch.  Honestly, Squirrel Hill has so many great places that it's tough to decide.  We decided on getting some pizza, but which one?  Again, there are so many.  We decided upon Aiello's and called ahead to place our order.  You can eat there or take out.   We took it back to my place.  We decided upon the \"White Pie\"  which is butter-garlic sauce and provolone cheese.  We got a 12-cut, 16oz pizza with tomatoes, spinach, and sausage on it.  I figured my husband could eat the leftovers for lunch.  The pizza was very good, but a little pricey here.  It was something like $25.00 for ours.  Oh and it's \"cash-only\", but they do have an on-site ATM.  For your convenience!",

I ordered at 8:40 pm and picked up my 8 cut, pepperoni and mushroom, green pepper and olive pizza, (nothing fancy but the $19 price)about 9 pm. The pizza looked beautiful. It tasted like it was reheated. The cheese was separated, the mushrooms had a slimy quality and there was no flavor to anything else. Very disappointed, no more overpriced Aiellos pizza for me! Oddly enough after watching MSNBC last week I will try another Squirrel Hill pizza institution. Last week while President Obama was in Pittsburgh, a smiling Howard Fineman made a comment on Hardball to the effect of, \"I hope he, referring to our President, gets a chance to stop at Mineo's for a pizza\". I have never had a Mineos pizza, but I trust Howard on all things political and now, on Pizza too.!! The poor quality of yesterday's pizza shocked us. Really, Aiellos, if you don't want to make a pizza on Sunday evening, please don't accept my order or my money.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, there aren't a ton of great pizza delivery places in our neighborhood.  After the last place we used to order from a lot served us a mosquito in our last pie, we jumped shipped, and decided to go for pick up.  Thus, our first pie from Aiello's.  TIP - CASH ONLY (there is a cash machine inside) and NO DELIVERY.  That being said, I ordered for pick-up on a Friday night.  20 minutes.  Perfect!  Even though the shop is located on one of the main drags in Squirrel Hill, I was able to find parking right across the street from the shop.  When I came into the shop, all the tables were filled.  Its a small place, so that's pretty easy.  You could tell is was a very popular place.  There are a couple cold cases where you can buy beer (decent selection) and, of course, Turner's Tea (only in da 'burg!).  The peeps working were friendly and checked me out fast.  I was in and out in 10 minutes, with a piping hot pizza in hand.  Now, for the most important part - the taste.  Welp, what do you think, given I gave it 4 stars.  Pretty damn good!  Even though we have to go through the extra step of picking up the pizza, we'll probably continue to order from here for our Friday night pizza movie nights.",

You don't pay when you order, you don't pay when you pick out a drink, you don't pay when you pick up the pizza, you don't pay until you're leaving the place. So bizarre, but whatever works for them.  Aiello's is a small little walk in pizza place in Squirrel Hill.  I went there after a hard Sunday afternoon bouldering, so I was hungry.  Four of us split a large pepperoni pizza which set us back about $20.  Filled us up enough, but not enough that we didn't go to Waffalonia after.  Neat neighborhood place, filled up quick with Steelers fans after the game was over.",

At the same time, I'm more than willing to endure herculean trials in pursuit of top tier pizza (hour and a half on the subway to Di Fara? no problem!)   I like the extra flour caked onto the crust, and the sauce isn't bad, but I see and taste nothing that could possibly come close to justifying the $30 price tag on a large gourmet. As a point of reference my favorite pizza on planet earth, Paulie Gee's, is $17. I can assure you PG does not cheap out on ingredients, and there is no way commerical rent is cheaper in Brooklyn than Murray Ave. So while there are far worse pies (really most places in town are worse, and maybe that explains the hype), it's not special enough for the special-occasion pricing.",

    "text": "My husband and myself were travelling through Pittsburgh enroute  to Canada from Washington DC. We searched for decent pizza restaurants along our route and decided on Aiello's as the reviews were pretty good. When we arrived in Squirrel Hill it appeared that there were a number of pizza establishments on the same road as Aiello's. Being that we were out if towners, we felt it a good idea to question what appeared to be locals walking the street. We asked which pizza establishment was the best. Each person agreed that they liked the atmosphere of a competitor however for the pizza alone, Aiello's was hands down the best. So we decided to go to Aiello's. We have been to great pizza establishments like Grimaldi's and John's in NYC, so our standards for a New York style pizza are quite high. I have to say, I loved this pizza. It wasn't a brick oven crust (that I could tell) but it was one of the best crusts I've ever had. Hubby and I both agree it was well worth the side trip off our route....and if we should ever find ourselves in Pittsburgh again, we will definitely go back.",

    "text": "My first adventure when visiting Pittsburgh was to decide for myself who had the best pizza in town - Mineo's or Aiello's. There's long been a debate between the two local pizzerias, located only a block or so from each other. I ordered one slice of pepperoni to go, headed to Aiello's and did the same, settled in at a bistro table along Murray Ave. and prepared my test slices. There is an obvious difference in the look of the slices and my first guess, based on appearance as best slice, went to Aiello's. But in all reality, looks don't matter so I dug in. The verdict? Mineo's won hands down because of its sauce, grease and cheese. However, Aiello's should not be ignored.  The slice was good.  Crispy crust, hot out of the oven and had sort of a sweet tomato sauce.   In 1967, Giuseppe, \"Joe,\" Aiello set sail for America from Palermo, Sicily to catch a fleeting dream. With only 13 dollars in his pocket, Giuseppe left his family, confident that the land of opportunity would provide more than an income but of the life he had dreamed about.   After years of kneading dough and simmering sauce for an employer, Giuseppe decided to fulfill his dream and open his own pizza shop.  April 5, 1978 marked the opening of Aiello's Pizza on Murray Ave. On May 13, 2013 Giuseppe passed away. Now his son, Michael, will continue the tradition Giuseppe started.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday for dinner with my wife.  It had been a long time since I was last at Aiellos and my wife and I ended accidentally walking past it before doubling back and finally finding it.  The inside of Aiellos is currently under construction but they have a counter in the front and the a seating area with a bunch of lunch table like booths in the back.  At Aiello's you order at the counter, grab your drink from one of the coolers and then pay as you leave.  For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split an extra large (18\") cheese pizza.  We ended up waiting about 20 minutes from ordering until our food was ready.  This pizza like all pizzas can be broken down into its three major components: crust, sauce and cheese.  Of the three I think that the crust was my favorite at Aiello's.  I would consider it to be a thin crust pizza with a nice crisp bottom and the crust actually reminded me of a baguette, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  My second favorite part of the pizza was the sauce which had a little sweetness at the first which was followed by a nice herby flavor.  Last but not least is the cheese which was decent also.  There was enough of it to cover the pie but not an excess of it.  The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't head back to Aiello's again in the future.  With the generally good review I probably have you scratching my head over that and while I will say that the pizza was pretty good, at $25 for a cheese pizza, I just think it costs way too much.",

My son had a slice of the stuffed pizza which had sausage and other ingredients sitting between a top and bottom slice of pie and he really enjoyed it.  They have an extensive menu of pizza and sandwiches and this made me wish that I could spend more time in Pittsburgh to try other items. I also like the pay as you leave setup.

I have to be honest, but I truly don't understand the hoopla about this place. It's not awful, but it's not really anything to rave about either. Maybe it was because by the time my coworker brought back the food my pizza wasn't that warm, but I just wasn't too impressed. After having a few pieces, I decided it may be the dough/crust. It didn't seem done. Not only was it mushy and falling apart (along with the cheese and sauce), but the flour still left on it was waaaaay too much for me. I had flour all over my face and hands. I'm usually a fan of mom and pop's pizza joints, but Aiello's didn't really cut it for me.   I'm giving this three stars because after microwaving a few pieces later on that night, it tasted better. I somehow preferred it microwaved? Hmm...",

This was an interesting tactic, as I usually write reviews pretty quickly and just save them as drafts if I don't want to post them immediately.  So this is what was special about Aiello's:  I don't really remember.  The pizza wasn't great and the pizza wasn't bad.  The crust was a medium thickness with a sweeter sauce and not as much cheese as I like.  I remember thinking that around $20 for a large cheese pizza seemed like too much.  As I was moving the day I got the pizza, delivery would have been really nice.  The storefront was standard pizza store.  But, kids, that's it.  Would I come back here?  Probably.  I might try the specialty pizzas or just order some different kinds by the slice.  But I just didn't think Aiello's was anything to write home about.  Cash Only",

    "text": "Several months ago, I ordered a white pie with stewed tomatoes from Aiello's for take out.  Because I was serving four people, I went with the extra large (18\"), which ran about $25.  The size of the pie was more than sufficient--in fact, I ended up with left overs.  When I called to order, the guy I spoke to told me to allow 40 min.  I was excited to try this pizza given its PGH cred.  In general, I'd call myself a fan of it, though I wouldn't call it the best pizza I've ever had, or even the best pizza I've had in PGH.  Honestly, it's hard for me to compare this pizza to others I've tried in PGH, given that most of them were standard margherita pies, and this was a white one.  Having said that, Aiello's pie was better than many of the mediocre pies I've tried around town.  The crust was nice and crispy, and the savory cheese and garlic base was complemented well by the juiciness and hint of sweetness of the stewed tomatoes.  My only major complaint was that the base of the pizza was rather dry, as at least one other reviewer has pointed out.  The juiciness of the stewed tomatoes definitely mitigated this shortcoming, however, so I'd recommend them as a topping.  Overall, Aiello's makes a solid and tasty, though rather expensive, pie.  If you're a fan of white or margherita pizza, I'd recommend the version I ordered.  Based on my experience, I'd order from them again if I happen to be hungry for pizza in Squirrel Hill.",

    "text": "Absolutely hands down my favorite pizza place in Pittsburgh. The abundance of a slightly sweet and well-seasoned sauce, in addition to thin and crispy crust sets Aiello's apart from its competitors. It's so good I get half-baked pies and bring them home to freeze until I feel like a pizza night. That's right- I would transport across the state because it was that good! The restaurant is simple and the place is cash only- don't forget to go to the ATM before!",

There is also a mystery spice in there...they wouldn't tell me.  Marjoram?  Thyme?  The cheese drier, more mozzarella and maybe little to no provolone.  Pepperoni rolls were good. Subtle in flavor, very nice crust.  White pizza was excellent.  Not over garlicky, same great crust.",

I think Mineo's crust is harder than Aiello's both times I've tried it. I also don't like onions being added AFTER the pizza is cooked so that my breath smells like a hot funky mess after eating it. So this is why I'm choosing Aiello's. According to sources, there are more pizza joints in the 'burgh than anywhere in the nation with 1,000+. My review could change upon trying more of them.",

    "text": "A few evenings ago we came to Squirrel Hill for Chinese food; I fell in love with a pizza.   On-street parking in Squirrel Hill is problematic regardless of where you go, but after driving around for a bit, we settled in front of a pizza parlor. A stout, squatty, greying, long-haired gentleman with a patriotic bandana wrapped around his head sat on a stoop. Looking like a retired pro wrestler, he seemed out of place in a neighborhood such as Squirrel Hill. Then again, so did Kay and I, which may have been why he reached out to us. Had we found a kindred spirit/guardian angel?   \"Hey, they've been out ticketin' even at this hour,\" he amicably, helpfully hollered over to us as we left our car in front of a parking meter. So feed the meter we did after we made some small talk with this man, finding out he lived in Penn Hills of all areas. It wasn't until we got into Ka Mei down the street that I realized that I just had a brush with a legend in Aiello's, a parlor with a pizza that often silences debates when cited.    Due to his act of kindness and the fact that Aiello's has a rather famous pizza, I found myself preoccupied during our Chinese meal at Ka Mei and dessert at Mineo's.  As we approached the car at the end of our date, I caught Aiello's neon sign in my sights again and felt drawn to it, so much so that I couldn't get in the car.  \"Kay, I just want one slice. I have to try it! I might as well. I mean, we're right here!\"  \"But you just ate!\" Kay was perturbed.  \"Yeah, but it was Chinese. You know how that goes. Besides, the guy was nice to us. I want to throw him a little business.\"  \"You're crazy,\" Kay declares. She got back in the car, and I headed into Aiello's.  I approached the counter and became Oliver Twist asking for more gruel.  \"I just wanna try your pizza. One slice. I hear so much about it, and I'm here y'know?\"  \"Plain?\" The streetwise guy we encountered earlier seemed self-assured, smirking as he took my order.  \"Yeah, that'll work! I can't wait!\"  \"You'll be back,\" he says with a grin, only to pull a whole pizza out from the oven to \"check\" on it, as if I didn't know it was a ruse; The Last Tempation of Darren W.   When I gazed at its skull-white crust and the deep, scarlet sauce that bubbled underneath the ivory cheese, I was entranced. A creature of terrible, bloody pulchritude was before me.   He put my slice on a plate, and I merrily took it back to the car, relishing it slowly as we headed to Beaver Falls. The crust was magnificently cracker-like. The sauce packed twang, punch, and luxuriance, complementing the subtle, milky cheese completely.   Kay's was green-eyed the whole way home, my heart having been stolen by a slice of pizza.  \"I hope you enjoyed your $2 whore!\"  \"But babe, it only cost $1.50.\"",

So today, I thought I'd check them out and see what's up.  It was around noon on a Sunday and fairly empty. I walked right in, ordered and started chatting with Mike, the owners son. Good guy, I can relate, being the son of a restaurant owner. It's funny to hear someone else tell the same stories, ha. He fixed me up with 2 slices of pepperoni and a pepperoni roll. The pepperoni roll was BOMB, so good, I loved the little bit of burnt cheese around the edges, so yummy. The slices were great, too. Thin, New York style and a few shakers of goodness-crushed peppers, parmesean cheese, etc.  The place was really clean, lots of seating in the back and plenty to drink. Beer or Soda available.  The big question: Are they better than Fiori's? Well, they are neck and neck in all honesty. I like that Fiori's is a little sweeter, but both pies are great. The pepperoni roll will bring me back for sure.  Oh, and open til 2am!",

Get the small rather than the large, the crust just turns out better with the small.  Italian hoagie with everything on it is a good option as well if you want more than just pizza, ask them to go heavy on the dressing.    A True Pittsburgh food landmark.  Grab a bite here and then catch a movie up the street or check out a great dive bar(Silkys)  next to the theater.",

They wanted to be sure that we were having a good time.  WE SURE DID.  They are very trusting and welcoming.  NEXT.  There was a huge selection to choose from.  I was there for pizza, but some people came in for pepperoni rolls that looked like savory little nuggets of goodness, plus lots of other food that I didn't really pay attention to. (lots of variety)  They had a huge listing of gourmet pizzas, but almost any pizza could be made and served by the slice.  My friend ordered two slices of something and mushroom and you couldn't even SEE the pizza there were so many toppings.  And they were fresh and delicious!    QUALITY.  I love white pizza and rarely find any I ever like.  THEIRS IS FANTASTIC.  I want to go back, I will go back, if you haven't gone go now!     Definitely order a pizza, it's worth it.  :-)",

So get past the gruff service and blinding interior, and enjoy why you're there: an amazing non-Neapolitan pie and best in Pittsburgh.  _________________________________ Ambiance: 2/5. Occasionally overrun by local highschoolers, especially on weekend nights, that's the lesser of two issues here. Prepare for fluorescent hell--white walls and table-tops turning this into an operating room. It's bland and outdated. Empty pizza box stacks and storage within diner's site doesn't help. _________________________________ Service: 3/5.  I don't mind the service after fifty or so trips. Essentially serve-yourself after you place your counter order. When placing, it's short, to the point, and occasionally warm or even playful. For newcomers, the gruff may be off-putting, and the shit-giving may stun, but get past it and realize it does little to detract once your order is placed. Pay when you leave, takeout or sit-down. _________________________________ Drinks: 1/5. Not serving alcohol or water at a sit-down is 1/5. Soda from the coolers bottled, so no refills. _________________________________ Food: 5/5. I've had most toppings and combos here over the years. I'll generalize as R/W and note significant details. After 20+ years, this is my #1 pizza in Pittsburgh, and when on point, among the best I've eaten in Baltimore, DC, NYC, Chicago, Naples, and Rome.   1) Red Pizza - excellent sauce. It's juicy and thin, fantastically sweet, and finishes with a lightly biting salt. Cheese is stellar too, though only mozzarella available. The dough is not quite crisp, but it's very fresh, fantastic flavor throughout, and the flour-dusted crust is soft yet perfectly chewy. Vegetables are canned, yes, but AIellos puts them under the cheese (might need to request it). This allows flavors to meld, particularly with the sauce. This is no Truer than with the pepperoni, where the meat imparts spiciness to the sauce as it begins cooling. The interplay becomes something fantastic, a spicy contrast to the rest of the pie, and it totally won me over years ago. It's what sets it apart from regulars like Mineos, Fioris, Bado's, Vincent's (now closed), and the like.  2) White Pizza - Always order a small. The crust comes out flakier, crispier, and more flavorful. An appropriately light amount of garlic. The Parmesan dusting completes the texture. Most toppings work, but get the stewed tomatoes. It's probably the best pizza here, even better than the red sauce-pepperoni. The tomatoes burst with flavor and sweetness, offsetting the bitterness of Parmesan and garlic, and add a juicy quality to the thick, doughy, and occasionally dry experience. It's the intricacy and texture of a great white pizza with all the flavors and freshness of a sweet red.",

    "text": "I've heard a lot about this place over the years, specifically the debate between Mineo's and Aiello's from their respective fans... but when our office intern kept raving about Aiello's, we knew we had to try it out for his last day.  You order when you arrive, pick out your drinks, and pay when you leave (CASH ONLY!)... we ordered a large white pizza (the intern's recommendation) and a large pepperoni.  There were 6 of us, so we found it a bit difficult to figure out seating, since they only have booths that comfortably seat 4 -- but we were able to secure 2 booths directly across from one another.  Not a big deal, just don't come here with everyone you know and expect to have a large place to eat in.    Once the pizzas arrived and essentially took up most of the table space, we dug in. I preferred the white pizza over the pepperoni.  The crust was just thin enough, cooked perfectly, and the cheese was sturdy enough to withstand actually picking the slice up and eating it.  The pepperoni was a bit flimsier, I'm assuming from all the grease, and required a knife and fork.  I only had one slice of the pepperoni before the devil on my shoulder dressed in a Fiori's t-shirt advised me that this pepperoni pie was just OK and, in my opinion, can't hold a candle to my beloved South Hills pizza joint.  I managed to snag one more piece of white pizza and eat it before starting to wish I had worn stretchy pants.  To sum it up -- Aiello's is good, but it's not great. I've had plenty of better pizza in this city, but to each their own. Some prefer sweeter sauce, some prefer more cheese, thinner crust, the list goes on and on.  I know most mom & pop pizza spots in this city have their following and I don't see Aiello's going anywhere ever... I'm just not sure it'd be my first choice when I'm craving a traditional pizza pie.",

    "text": "Good Pizza, Crappy Service   My bf and i were in the area. We had dinner plans set for an hour later, but didnt eat all day. I searched yelp to find some pizza by the slice and it suggested Aiello's.   Pizza is like $1.80 plus 30 cents for toppings. My bf wanted a margarita pizza, but the one they had offered looked old (and to be honest didnt really resemble margarita pizza). I considered a pepperoni roll, but figured a slice would fill me up more.   The pizza was okay, above average for sure. It had a sweet sauce and the crust wasnt limp or soggy. I normally ditch the ending crust of pizza but i enjoyed Aiello's.   This pizza is well deserving of 4 stars. The reason for my 3 star review is that all 3 workers seemed have a crappy attitude. We came in happy and hungry. We had questions on the menu so they knew that we were new. No one even bothered to smile at us or give us any detail on the pizza or the menu (Legit, not one smile from one person. Is it that hard to smile?). Their sour attitudes almost ruined the experience for us. Luckily the pizza (semi) made up for it.  -Cash Only-",

Order well done extra crispy small pizza with extra sauce and extra cheese. No pizza is better. Period.  As far as pizza rankings in Pittsburgh, mine are as follows:  1. Aiello's  2. Beto's (with baked cheese)  3. Della Sala's (extra cheese) 4. Slice on Broadway (original)  5. Cucina Bella  Mineo's fell off a cliff...Aiello's now is how Mineos used to taste in its glory days.",

    "text": "Okay, here's the thing . . .   Aiellos is the best pizza in Pittsburgh. I'm telling you . . . It is the best. Yes, I have had Mineos. It doesn't compare. I wouldn't care if the inside of this pizza shop looked like a prison (side note: it kinda does right now because it is undergoing a major remodel) because the pizza is THAT good.   I have been going to Aiellos consistently for years. It was love at first bite. They even back their pizza up with a: you-don't-like-it-you-don't-pay-for-it guarantee.   I bet it has never had to be honored.   On a practical and helpful level, here are a couple things you should know:  1. It's cash only   2. You pay after you order AND eat (hence guarantee)   3. You grab your own drink(s) from the cooler and pay for it/them after   4. A True measure of a pizza is its ability to stand on its own as a regular cheese pizza. Order that. (BUT my friends also swear by the white with feta)   5. You can park for free on side streets like Douglas (where I always park) up the street a bit (because there are some pay spots closer to Murray)  This pizza is worth you going out of your way to experience. AND it might not be far fetched to say the pizza SHOP wouldn't be worth your time to go out of your way to experience too once the remodel is complete. Aiellos pizza originated in 1978 with a recipe straight from Italy. I hope that recipe is locked in a gold chest somewhere.   It's that precious.",

Fresh ingredients from the dough to the toppings. Always comes out extremely hot but also delicious. Aiello's makes the best pizza in Pittsburgh. They have a variety of other options from pizza. Their apps are also very good. I remember when it was very small with about 9 booths in the whole place. Now that they have renovated, the place is much cleaner and spacious. 10/10 would recommend.",

    "text": "One of the best pizza places in the burgh. Their pizzas are very good!  Not a typical pizza experience, but I had a bowling group draft at Aiellos where they were able to reserve the back portion of the restaurant for a group of about 30. Aiellos was great about feeding us, and adding to the tab whenever we decided we were still hungry they would simply ask us how many slices/pies, what toppings, and then brought it out to us when it was ready. They also allowed us to use their tv to project from a laptop to make tracking the draft results easier. The seating was perfect since there were plenty of tables, and the bar next to us so we could also watch the NCAA playoff game(Bama won :/)  The pies were all nice and hot, and tasted great. I tried 3 different pies -  regular, pepperoni, and banana pepper. I enjoyed all of them very much.  The environment was noisy due to 30 grown men taking up a large portion of the place, but that was just part of the atmosphere. Can't expect a pizza place to be quiet or it probably means they don't get much business.   I'll def go back",

There is absolutely nothing fancy about this restaurant but well worth the trip for the quality of pizza and the friendly staff. The person behind the counter was super nice and asked us a lot of questions, like how we heard of the place and where we were from etc. It definitely felt like we stumbled into a hometown pizza spot. The old school booths and tables in the back had parmesan cheese on them and strangers were just passing them around as needed.   At one table there was a bunch of teenagers and at another there was large group of what looked like businessmen after work. The crowd was diverse, but you could tell everyone just came for the pizza goodness. I enjoy pizza with a slightly sweet sauce and the right amount of cheese that doesn't make it covered in hard mounds of cheese ... and this pizza met both criteria. Right up my ally!   Another plus is that they have multiple coolers of drinks including different beers and ciders. We just picked what we wanted and paid at the end for what pizza and drinks we consumed. I loved the laid back, trusting vibe of the staff and customers. If you are looking for a pristine, classy place, then I wouldn't choose Aiellos. But if you are interested in hometown, good pizza by the slice or pie, then I'd recommend it!   I'll definitely be back to order a whole pie next time!",

I really enjoyed the traditional slice topped with pepperoni sausage and mushroom, so much so that I tried to eat my bf's slice too! The white pizza margherita was just ok wouldn't order it again. I liked the pepperoni rolls and they were serving two at a time since that days batch came out a little small in size. Normally the marinara is an additional $.75 but they threw that in free, also tasted the cheese steak, they serve theirs with steak sauce on and my bf ordered his with mayo instead, it was a bit bland so maybe it needs the sauce. All in all I'd go back and stick with the traditional pie, that's what Aiello's seems to do best! That and providing great customer service!",

First of all, I'd like to state that this restaurant came highly highly recommended to me by my one friend so I was rather excited to try it out.   I took my girlfriend and we got there and it looked good and smelled amazing. We ordered a small for both of us (8 slices). However when we went to checkout, the pizza was a \"gourmet\" small and therefore was almost double the price! So we paid $30 for ONE pizza and a beer instead of $12.50 for one pizza and a beer. I even tried to pay TWICE before receiving my food but they wouldn't take it, just told me to wait.   If you do come here, which I advise against, be careful not to get scammed.   Also as a side note, I found the beer selection very subpar.",

Depending on my mood I could really crave a slice of Aiello's. I won't take it out, it is a must eat in. The shop is little but has a few tables in the back.   The best part is the photo's on the wall. It appears that a Pittsburgh native went pro. Mike McCathy the Green Bay Packers Coach was from Greenfield and ate at Aiello's a lot.  Great picture.   I was introduced to Aiello's when a prior boss, would bring Aiello's into the break room for everyone during break to enjoy. He knew the owner and was given a free large pizza each visit, and in return he would share it with the staff.   where the pizza is good and CASH ONLY, the service is horrible. They lack any kind of friendliness. Seems to robotic to me, and lacking any kind of customer service. If you can get past that, the pizza is well worth a try.",

This was  I think a 12 slice pizza.  Totally overpriced.  The menu is very hard to read and so you have no idea how much anything will cost until you already eat it.  OVERPRICED!  I live nearby and will be taking my business to the many other pizza shops in Squirrel Hill.",

I'm not going to compare it to the pizza I had in X city that supposedly has some authority to proclaim itself authentic. I'll merely say that I tried Aiello's last night for the first time and I was impressed. The sauce was good, the crust was just the right balance of crisp, yet pliable, and the toppings didn't feel like they were slopped on from a can (onion with half black olive and the other half pineapple). It also didn't feel particularly greasy. All around solid pizza.   I also liked that when I called and they said it would be ready in 15 minutes, that it was. I walked in and 3 minutes later they pulled it out of the oven and I was on my way. I also liked that the place was bright and super clean. You just get the feeling that they are professionals who love what they do.   I don't know if it is my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh, but it's definitely vying for the crown.",

I am not a pizza snob by any means, and have eaten everything from frozen pizza, airport pizza, fast food pizza, and genuine Italian pizza, but this pizza just fell off target. I got just a slice of the plain cheese pizza and could tell that the cheese was definitely fresh and the dough homemade. However, the sauce was overly sweet, the dough was a bit tough, and overall it was a rather bland piece of pizza. It fell somewhere between Italian pizza and American pizza, but sadly failed to be either.",

It's definitely greasy and piled high with cheese. the crust here held up better than its neighbor's, thin and crispy with a sweet sauce. stronger oregano flavor. a slice of pepperoni runs you $2.10 cash.  sure, it's a pittsburgh establishment. i tried it once. but unless i've got nostalgia for childhood birthday parties past, i'll get my pizza elsewhere.",

I've brought this pizza to friend's houses who have never had it and they love it and can taste the difference in this pizza. It's obvious it's just made with LOVE- they really season the sauce, they use good quality dough and cheese- it makes allll the difference. Recently, Aiello's has expanded and their restaurant now has much more seating. They are a great place for beers and a killer pie.

    "text": "Fantastic pizza! I love that it's open late and you can eat in or grab a slice or a whole pizza to go.  This was my first time in since their construction. I like the new little bar area and the beer coolers. They had a good selection, including some local offerings.  My boyfriend and I stopped in late on a Friday night after a show. There was a fair number of people in there. We ordered a few slices to go. It was ready fairly quickly. They have pepper flakes and cheese and everything to fix up your slices before you go. The pizza is pretty cheap and delicious. The only bad part was that we didn't buy more.",

I've been going since graduate school and it never fails to satisfy with tastiness.   The pizza itself feels top-quality - great toppings, wonderful sauce and crust that has a crunchiness and a chewiness (the perfect blend!). The rest of their menu is also top-notch (I have a particular love for their pepperoni rolls).   The bar is a great addition with a surprising number of options on tap and a HUGE wall of bottled beers. They even have brewed root beer that is just wonderful.",

But because there's barely any salt, the pizza also had very minimal flavor. The cheese is definitely on point and the dough was also well made but there just needed to be a little more taste to it. When I get pizza I know it's unhealthy for me but that's the point, I want to enjoy and not care. It was hard trying to satisfy any kind of craving with bland pizza.",

    "text": "Coldplay bought a slice. They bought a slice for you. In fact they bought another two. And they were all Aiello.  I love Pitt style pizza. It's done best by 2 places.. Fiori and Aiello. You should try both of them and decide for yourself which is superior. Aiello is in the much trendier part of town, but is probably my second fave of the two. Still it's easily 5-star pizza. And Pitt has some of the better has-its-own-style pizza of any town in the country, honestly. Only a handful (Buffalo, Detroit, Chicago, NYC) are better to me.  So it's an excellent slice of dry, cheesy Pittsburgh-style Pizza. One of the highlights is watching them spin the dough and make the pies right in front of you. They're extremely busy and hectic at the best of times, so don't expect them to always hit the nail on your proverbial head with regards to order accuracy.",

We ordered a small (8 cut) pepperoni, which was about $15. The pizza was decent, which I liked the crust. FYI, they put the cheese on top of the toppings.

    "text": "In Pittsburgh, you cannot beat Aiello's...and honestly, as I travel more and more - I'm beginning to realize you can't beat it anywhere.  Let me first address several issues that I've found with other reviews:  1) A sweet taste to the sauce...absolutely, and it's amazing that way (high quality).  If you don't like it, go order Papa John's and get sauce from a 5 year old can.  2) This is not New York-style pizza.  I have no idea where people got that idea.  New York-style pizza is known for wide cuts with a thin crust.  Aiello's is nothing like that.  The cuts are \"normal\" sized and have a delicious crust that is finely balanced between thick and thin.  It's not a Chicago deep dish and it's not cheese & sauce on paper like New York...it's a happy medium.  3) Mineo's was the original but has since gone down hill.  This is where you want to go.  Aiello's will be cleaner with higher quality ingredients and a better crowd.  With all of that said, Aiello's has increased their prices in recent years and I'm growing a little tired of that...somehow inflation is 3 percent but at Aiello's it's 10 or 20 percent.  Doesn't make sense to me...but then again, I haven't lived in Pittsburgh for 6 years and because Pittsburgh is so inexpensive - I don't even notice when I come back for a slice (it's still cheaper than pizza in other cities).  Final recommendations:  - Get two slices \"off the top\" and don't have it reheated.  I promise you, you'll never look back.  - Bring cash, they don't take cards.  - Grab one of those Car Mart magazines from the counter by the front door and you'll have something to read while you eat.",

If you have any snotty friends from New York City who say that Pittsburgh pizza is worthless, send them to Aiello's to shut them up.   R.I.P.

    "text": "We knew this was going to be an adventure ....  We had to travel from Frederick to Cleveland to see my father in the hospital, so we figured we'd break the long drive home with a quick detour into Pittsburgh for dinner ... preferably the best pizza they had to offer. Internet research indicated Murray Ave (Squirrel Hill) is the hotspot - and it's an easy exit right off an interstate. So why not? Of course, we happened to pick the one weekend where they closed Squirrel Hill tunnel on I-376 and sent traffic through a winding maze of city streets - which meant we spent an extra hour in stop/go traffic getting to Murray St, and then an extra 2 hours in even worse conditions getting back out onto the interstate.  Once we parked in an official spot near the restaurant - as opposed to  the virtual parking spot the detour had become - we chose Aiellos; it  had fewer reviews than Mineos, but all positive (seemed people either loved or hated Mineos).  Hard to believe - but the pizza was actually worth it all. It was that good. Crust just perfectly crisp and yet slightly chewy. Flavorful, lightly sweet sauce. Cheese perfectly browned (not soggy and underdone like so many pizza shops near our home). Friendly staff (I tried to pay, and the younger guy at the counter said \"pay when you're done, if you don't like, don't pay at all\").   We had a plain cheese pizza (the True test), and another with sausage, roasted peppers, onions. Both were excellent.  Take cash - they don't take cards (but do have an ATM). Don't expect ambience - there's maybe half dozen hard booths and plastic utensils. No beer or wine ... though I think I read somewhere that you can bring your own (? - call them first).  This is a low key affair, but the pizza really is as good as everyone else is saying ...",

The staff couldn't be more nice.  Everyone goes out of their way to meet you, know you, and provide a great pizza chomping atmosphere.  This is one of the few places in the world where ordering plain cheese is amazingly delicious and satisfying.  Order it \"off the top\" for a slice heated to perfection, but not too steamy...believe me, if you get it too hot, you will burn your mouth after not being able to wait for it to cool to taste your slice.  It's going to drive me crazy not being able to have Aiello's all the time.  I guess I have to plan more trips to Pittsburgh.  PS: Crazy inexpensive (!!!) CASH ONLY",

I liked the smaller cuts--though it led to eating too many slices.   This place was definitely worth it and about the same price as we're used to from NY. We ate plain cheese though so maybe that explains it.  I would say the pizza tastes different from what we make for ourselves, but we will definitely have it again.  I wouldn't recommend eating in the store since it's really hot from all the pizza ovens. We got our pizza to go, and it was hot enough that we didn't have to microwave it after a 10 min walk home.",

I'm not going to hide the fact that the lettuce component is entirely iceberg, but with plenty of toppings to round out even the most basic salad I certainly can't complain. The lettuce was fresh, the tomatoes were above-average, and a nice dash of pizza seasoning over the top adds a pleasing body to the mix.  For all the gory details, I posted a review over on FoodBurgh... <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodburgh.com%2F2009%2F09%2Freview-aiellos-pizza%2F&s=413b38c6c3bfe7d93b2aaff12f357f431c5aeb4096088daa0cfc3d71e9d4c3f1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodburgh.com/2009/09/re...</a> I highly recommend stopping by to give them a try.",

    "text": "I don't want to throw gas on the never ending feud that is the Aiello's/Mineo's war, but let me give you some historical perspective.  In 1869, freshly returned from his reverse trip on the Oregon Trail, Erasmus Jebediah Aiello came to Pittsburgh only to find his arch nemesis/famous actor Sal Mineo had taken up residence in the middle of a giant hill.  Sal Mineo proceeded to whip an apple with amazing force hitting Erasmus right in his junk.  This made Sal Mineo laugh, and Erasmus, understandably, cry.  Swearing revenge, Erasmus used the skills he had learned from a mystical tribe of Native Americans and made a deal with the chief of the squirrels (his name was Benjamin) to fight Sal Mineo.  With the deal struck, the squirrels attacked Sal Mineo with all of their fury, and after an epic struggle, managed to kill him in 1976.  The crime was pinned on a drifter.  And since that day, the area surrounding the massacre has been known as \"Squirrel Hill.\"  After that, their ancestors coincidentally both opened pizza places on Murray Avenue, which was named after Bill Murray after he beat a steam driving machine in a race.  But I digress.  This place is unbelievable, and I am so glad that my wife introduced me to it.  If it's not the best pizza I have ever had in the area, it is at least in the top 3.  Either by the slice, or one of their specialty pizzas, I have never been disappointed.  On a personal note: Children of Erasmus (fun fact: that's what all the people that work at Aiello's like to be called), get a fucking credit card machine.  You officially do enough business to make it a convenience to your customers.",

No biggie, they put in three slices in the oven right away and we got our pizza within a few minutes.

When you live in or around the Squirrel Hill area, you are asked to answer one simple question; Aiello's or Mineo's. I choose Aiello's, though Mineo's is pretty damn good too. It's something about Aiello's sauce that puts it over the top for me. I've never had a better local pizza in Pittsburgh. The staff are pretty friendly, especially if you frequent their shop often. There's specialty pizzas, pizza by the slice, hoagies, desserts, salads and other items. It is a little on the pricey side especially for the specialty pizzas.

The center of the pizza molded into the wax paper forming a grotesque Stromboli of cold, tasteless toppings.   The mushrooms are genetically modified to only have the visual appearance of a 'mushroom'. On the only non-negative note, the crust around the perimeter was passable: firm, floury, not soggy or greasy.   In the center however, the crust had the structure of a wet paper towel.

Love their crust, it was nice and crispy and their sauce was not too spicy, so I was a fan of that. Their large and medium pizzas are enormous so you definetely get your moneys worth.   In terms of ambiance, the place is a bit old, there are booths on the back and you bus your own table when you are done. The Parmesan and the red pepper flakes tend to sit on a counter so if someone is using it, you have to ask for it.

Upon entering Aiello's, one can see the typical decor of this pizza parlor. Everything is plastic, white, and sterile and I'm direct contrast to the warm, wooden interiors of Mineo's. I put in our dinner order at the counter:  Italian Wedding Soup Small Pizza With Pepperoni Small Stromboli: Pepperoni Steak Bacon and Meatball; sauce on the side Bottled Water  The Wedding Soup arrived rather hot (microwaved) and in a styrofoam container. I am always wary of styrofoam adding flavor, but it didn't in this case. The soup was actually rather tasty and we split it between the two of us. I do have a fondness for a wedding soup that has a strong cheese flavor to it.   Our pizza was the next to arrive and looking at it I was a tad distressed as I could see all of the added seasoning and all of the seasoning in the sauce. I took a piece hoping the heat would sterilize the flavor of what appeared to be excess spice. I ate the entire piece but was not pleased. I took another piece to see if the cooling process had amplified the flavor and found that it had. I decided to wait on the stromboli.  I looked at my friend and asked him what he thought and he just grimaced. He is much more forgiving of over seasoned items than I am and he still stopped eating the pizza in favor of waiting for the stromboli.   When our stromboli arrived, I was happy that I ordered the sauce on the side. I served a piece to my friend and found, much to my chagrin, that sauce had also been placed inside the food. I had already committed both of us to trying the pizza pastry by this point and decided to move forward. What I tasted made me stop eating. Not only had they put sauce on the inside, but they had put a lot of extra Italian seasoning on the inside.   I don't know how people can eat this much Italian spice. I can only assume that the people that like this spicing of their food also like to eat spoonfuls of Italian seasoning out of the spice jar in the cupboard. If not for the Italian Wedding soup I would really want to give this parlor a zero star.   I will not return.",

The crust is really nice here, crispy and chewy, and the sausage is one of the best. We usually get pepperoni, sausage and mushrooms.   It tastes better fresh out of the oven there of course, but takeout is great too. I've had the tiramisu as well (I don't think they make that though) which is tasty too.",

I tried both, and while both are good, my clear favorite is Aiello's.  For traditional pizza, I recommend an 'off the top' pie. It's deliciousness cannot be explained. It's warm meltiness will soothe what ails ya!  But my all-time go to our is the white. I love a good margarita pizza, so we ordered one here. It was delicious, as expected, but tipped the scales at about $30. Unable to handle the sticker shock, I spent a few minutes looking over the menu before out next visit. If you order a white pizza with stewed tomatoes as a topping, it'll cost you about $10 less! Then we top with fresh basil from the garden and there you have it! So flavorful, and it'll reheat nicely in a toaster oven, but is still good cold, which is the True pizza test.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have ordered pizza / salads from here a few times now and I'd rate it as a solid American style pizza place.  The cheese and toppings are tasty, but the sauce (mainly due to its overabundance) and crust could be improved somewhat.  The main reason we continue to occasionally order from here is probably due to their great house salad and home made italian dressing.  The salad is loaded up with a large variety of toppings including pepperoni, fresh tomatoes, and an abundance of cheese which when combined with the excellent dressing results in a great side to go along with the average pizza.  Their decision to accept cash only is really annoying and prevents me from ordering from here more often, which is only exacerbated by the fact that everything they sell is really expensive.",

    "text": "Aiello's does a truly great white pizza: one of the best I've ever had.  I can also recommend Aiello's strombolis and margherita pizza.   In general, their flavor profile tends toward the nutty satisfaction of parmesan and roasted garlic.   It's winter pizza, good for warming your belly for a walk home in the snow.  Mineo's down the street is more summer pizza, thinner crust and more of an emphasis on sauce that gives you a jolt of energy on warm twilit evenings.   Aiello's is open fairly late and their pizza reheats well, so it's ideal for those of us who often find our way there after a long day's work.  In house slices are cheap, though getting a fresh pie for a party can get pricy.",
