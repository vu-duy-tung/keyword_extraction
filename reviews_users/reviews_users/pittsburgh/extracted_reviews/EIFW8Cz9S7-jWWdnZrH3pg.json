No more crab legs (2 small clusters for $7 doesn't count), prime rib has been replaced by top round (what a joke), no ribs, and no peel'n'eat shrimp. That used to be the only items I ate lol. Also the grille has removed 2 of the 6 most expensive items as well. The food quality of the remaining items also seemed to be on the downhill as well. The chicken and salmon were completely dried out. The only thing worthwhile was the dessert selection. Definitely not going back.",

I went to the buffet.  When I returned, no drink.  I had to go hunt down a waitress to get my drink.  The food was slightly below the quality you get at Golden Corral.  For $30, you would expect a really good buffet, but the food was tepid, over cooked, and largely bland.  The deserts were fair.  I cleaned my first plate (it didn't have much on it to begin with) and went for a bit more.  My dirty plate remained on the table the entire time I remained in the buffet - nor was my drink ever refilled.  More people had been seated in my section by that time, but I guess nobody told the waitress who was helping them, cause she ignored me and my attempts to get eye contact.  Finally, enough was enough.  I left, without any tip.  2 stars only because the food was edible.",

The facility and decor is very nice; however the flow can be a little congested with the bar location and the seating area. I ate a lot; however, the food didn't wow me. Especially with no seafood on the buffet that was disappointing to myself as well. Dessert section was certainly the best and most memorable part of the meal. Service was slow in my section. The girl waiting on us never seemed to be around and I would look at the section by the windows and the male server/host there was constantly going back and forth to tables/back to attend to guests. If I ever go back to the casino I'd come back to the buffet as its a good value - just nothing on the wow factor side.",

In regards to the food, it too left a lot to be desired. The prime rib was terribly over cooked, as were the sweat potatoes, and the salad bar was just a lot of brown and wilting ice burgh lettuce. They didn't even have a variety of leafy greens...just the browning lettuce. The desserts were probably the only saving grace, and even they weren't spectacular! What solidified my opinion of this dinning experience happened while we were walking out. We passed by roughly 5 employees, and none of them took the time to thank us for dining with them, let alone let a smile slip out. I realize you work in a cassino and people probably treat you horribly, but this is your job. Be better than that. Try to make your guests feel welcome and comfortable.",

The price is very reasonable and I recommend the Sunday brunch which is $19.99 and includes all you can drink bloody Marys or mimosas.  On our last visit we went for lunch on a Saturday afternoon before a Pitt game. You do often have to wait in line to get in and pay (pay when you enter) but the line usually goes pretty fast.  The lunch was $14.99 which includes a non alcoholic beverage.  You have so many options including a soup/salad bar-my favorite and the items are always fresh. Then there is an Asian and Italian station.  You can make your own stir fry.  There is also American station (awesome meat carving station) and of course the desserts-save room.  They have gelato, cupcakes, warm chocolate chip cookies and many other tasty treats.  This is great for large groups!",

This is at least twice what any other buffet in PGH. costs.  A bit out of the way, as well so, you really have to be a buffet person , I spose. You have to park in that parking garage and then walk to the elevator and then walk in and through the smoky casino and then over to that escalator and then into the buffet area so, it's a production to get there ...

The Sunday brunch is now $14.99 instead of $19.99 and as a result they have removed all forms of shrimp from the menu, the prime rib has been replaced with a bottom round roast that was so tough I thought I was chewing on my belt. Crab legs are still available though for an additional $6.99 a pound. The free mimosas are gone and you now pay $1.00 each for them but they use a spumante instead of champagne. The turkey I tried was very moist and delicious and the desserts are great but that was the only bright points i experienced. I tried some meatballs from the italian section that were again, very, very dried out which should not happen on a day as busy as Sunday when there is a line waiting to get in. The pot-stickers were bland and flavorless and lacked sufficient filling. Even the salad bar was lack luster in that it was missing basic staples such as croutons, green peppers, hard boiled egg, sliced mushrooms and other salad toppings you would expect like sunflower seeds and dried cranberries. Bottom line is the salad bar at any local Eat-N-Park blows the one at Grandview out of the water. I would rather pay the additional $5.00 again and have the quality back. Until that happens you won't see me back there.",

I love being able to sit outside and eat, although it makes the walk to the buffet longer, that only means you're burning more calories to eat.  The drinks are always good. Never too watered down. The last time I was there the waitress made it's point to make sure we go, \"turnt up\" as she put it.  Make sure you bring your players card for a discount. And make sure you bring your appetite and maybe wear sweatpants.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to the buffet here as it seemed like a good price for it. When I went, it was about 6 pm on a Tuesday. The wait wasn't very long to be seated but the way they seat was unorganized. The hostess pointed out an empty table but we still wandered toward the water side to see if there were any tables and then went back to the empty table where I ultimately sat. I didn't say anything about having a seating preference so I'm not sure why we had to wander. While dining, I did notice the same scenario happening several times.  As for the food, they have a wide arrangement of food; Asian, American, Italian, BBQ, salad bar, and desserts. You can add a pound of crab legs for $6.99, which I did. I'd have to say that all of the food was very average. Everything I took was average in taste and quality. The salad bar was very minimal in the choice of ingredients but helped supplement my meal. I did enjoy the crab legs, but that's something that's hard to screw up.  The dessert stand was slightly better in quality. Everything is single serving as expected and was tasty enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. I had a taste of their ice cream, creme brulee, warm chocolate cake (my favorite, surprisingly), and baklava.  I was hoping for better tasting food as a whole but did leave satisfied. Will I eat here again? Most likely not.",

Compared to other casino buffets I've visited in Vegas or other cities, this restaurant was extremely reasonably priced and still offered an amazing selection of scrumptious foods.   From crab legs to the Italian buffet, fresh-sliced hot roasts, Mongolian BBQ and sushi, this place really offers something for everyone. And then there were about 20 different desserts selections to ponder, such as mini creme brulee, bananas foster, and gelato!   My complaint here was the drink situation. There aren't drinks available on the buffet, so you have to wait for the server to come and refill your glasses. Additionally, we were never offered coffee nor had the opportunity to ask for it since our \"server\" didn't come around too often.   Overall - one and a half thumbs up.",

I think the food was great. Even though the pizza was good, I did not care for the Italian food because it was all starches and no meatballs. The dining area was very classy, like I was eating at an expensive restaurant and not at a Golden Corral. I've told a couple of my friends about Grandview Buffet and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Oh heck yes!!  I have heard about this buffet for the past couple of years, but since I was not 21, I was not able to go.  Well lets just say it is the best food $20 can get you in Pittsburgh.    The reason it did get a star knocked off was for the staff.  We came with a larger group for my birthday, and I understand that you may be not ready at all times for a group over 10 people to walk through the doors, but come on.  Do not have your hostess get sassy and rolling her eyes, and do not throw us up against a wall to wait in the middle of the way for 15mins.  And please oh please do not suggest to a family that is celebrating a birthday that you may need to be split up.    Now that we got past those regards... Food time:  There were so many different stations of food.  I was shocked by the \"brunch\" they had.  I figured it would be breakfast type items.  Never did I imagine to see prime rib, BBQ grilled chicken, and Mongolian Wok being served for brunch!  It was all very delicious.  They even had sushi!  Though honestly I have had better sushi at some cheap Chinese buffets, but still it was edible.  When it comes to food, I don't have much to complain about.  Desserts were great too!  So many options, and so many of them were plated in smaller portions, so you could try every single one if your heart desired!  Like I said, other than the choppy beginning with the wait staff all rolling their eyes at us trying to stay out of the way and rearranging the tables ourselves to make due, it was a great time.  I wanna come back for the seafood special!!",

The Grandview Buffet allows you to do all of this and more with their countless choices and speedy service.   The buffet is nothing short of amazing. With various stations including BBQ, Italian, Mongolian and Asian, there is definitely something that will satisfy your hunger. Everything is kept up to temp and they do a great job at refilling things when need be. Some of my favorite items include their meatballs, coconut shrimp, crab legs and turkey.   Another awesome part of the buffet is their salad station. They're always changing up their speciality salads so you can try something new each time you visit. Last night they had a mouthwatering pasta salad using tortellini and an interesting chicken and rice salad. So good! Try their cole slaw as well! I loooove when vinegar is used and they make it perfectly.   Now on to the desserts. OMG. The best! Cookies, cake, ice cream, puddings... the list goes on!   Prices are a little expensive ($22/person), but it's well worth it. Try the Sunday champagne brunch as well! For the same price and pretty much the same food with added breakfast items, it's all-you-can-drink mimosas, beer and Bloody Mary's.",

The salad bar offers a variety of fresh greens and prepared salads such as three bean, tuna, chicken, etc..  The hot food sections are consistent in quality. The sushi is a must though it is very basic. The dessert bar is probably the finest I've seen at a buffet. I have not had the breakfast buffet here but I would not be surprised if it was up to par. All in all the Grandview offers consistency and is a good value. Show your players club card and receive 10% discount.",

You would think you would want people to come enjoy the buffet so they would stay and play at the casino . I don't know who is managing the buffet now but they would be great at managing a garbage dump because they turned a good buffet to garbage.

Most of my adventures in gluttony are for the Sunday Champagne Brunch, 22 bucks for all-you-can-eat and drink, choice of mimosa or Bloody Mary.  My favorite options during the Sunday Champagne Brunch are the salad bar, pastries, and the carving station.  You cannot leave this brunch without dirtying at least 4 plates.  And if you are looking to get more bang for your buck, ask for champagne only instead of a regular mimosa.  Grandview Buffet also features holiday brunch options and a Seafood Brunch.  I usually have only had to wait on Sundays, but it's never long.  Player's Club members get a few dollars off all brunch options!",

    "text": "I'm no stranger to casino buffets as I lived in Nevada for 9 years.  I have been to at least 30 different buffets from Rail City in Sparks, NV to the Mirage in Vegas.  I was never at the Grand View pre-crab leg, so I can't comment on that.  I have been to Grand View about 8 times which makes me feel confident enough to leave a review.  I will say this, they are consistently below average based on my experience.  The serving stations are a bit odd.  I found it frustrating in one section where I needed to nearly bend my body in half to reach the BBQ sauce.  The serving utensils are often covered in food which is absolutely ridiculous given the amount of staff that stand, or should I say lean against things behind the stations.  On my last visit, the guy working the Italian section was actually eating a bowl of something while I was standing there waiting for him to finish.  The food is consistently cold.  I understand it's difficult to keep food to temp with heat lamps and wells, but it's cold, cold.  I do feel uneasy eating their beef products.  Everything is over sauced and over spiced/seasoned.  As if they are trying to cover something up.  Or maybe they are just attempting too much with a simple dish.  The overall set up of the buffet is strange.  First are the plates which are practically placed on the floor in cubby holes in the walls.  Not the most sanitary thing I have ever seen.  I guarantee anyone who sneezes or coughs within 20 feet of those plates, you're eating it.  The salad bar is wedged up against a support column and a bar, so it almost feels like you are not supposed to go behind it.  The salad bar is excellent and the one thing which seems offer some consistency.  The soup is absolutely awful.  The worst I have ever tried in my life.  They waste a lot of square footage with an area that makes a few different kinds of sushi rolls, which really isn't sushi at all.  Nobody eats it and I find myself very reluctant to try it as well.  They have an MTO pasta station which is very uninviting.  The staff is not very helpful and people often walk by and around it confused, not quite knowing what they are supposed to do.  The buffet host/manager spends most of his time standing at the entrance rather than touching tables or observing operations as he should be doing.  The guests really are annoying here and are often confused.  I can't tell if it's because of the poor flow of the buffet, or simply because every indecisive person in Pittsburgh eats here.  Someone will be in your way, or get in your way at just about every point of the dining experience.  On my last visit a typical yinzer pulled his chair so far out from his table I could not even get out of my seat.  The brunch is decent, but but seems to be always missing something.  The last omelette I ate had so much cooking oil in it it was literally oozing out of the eggs.  The staff are allowed to utilize their cell phones behind the serving stations which is really annoying.  I went once on a Monday and could clearly see they were using leftovers from the night before.  It's always a chore to find the right condiment for your selection.  I like horseradish with my beef, and every time it tastes completely different.  And I hate to say this, but they really need to have a bottle of ketchup or hot sauce at every table.  That is how poor some of the food is seasoned.  The servers are very nice and really do weel despite the logistic challenges of the dining layout.  Really makes me miss the Eldorado in Reno or Mirage in Vegas.  If you are used to Golden Corral type dining experience then this will exceed your expectations.",

They also had unlimited crab legs, prime rib, and shrimp.  It was awesome for the money and I was a regular customer, there was always an enormous line and it was jam packed.  They must have hired some new food and beverage coordinator a few years back, because this place is absolutely horrible now.  I no longer will go, I've given this place several chances due to the good will they've earned from me in the past but that is over now.    All the foods are cheap, dry, and bland.  The place is usually empty now and for obvious reasons.  One gets the feeling this is how they like it, as the buffet is really just an item on a list that casinos have to have apparently.  I used to go for the buffet and stay and gamble and drink etc, have a grand time but now it's not even worth it, it's usually just a few old timers in hoverounds, it looks like monroeville mall.  It would have been much better if they had just shut down the Buffet than to keep it on life support or like some soulless brain dead corpse they've reanimated.  It's sad because there are no other non Asian food buffets in Pittsburgh except Golden Corral which is horrible, but even that place beats grand view now because it's like half the price.    Save your money and just go to Mcdonalds or something, and you won't have the urge to gamble away your hard earned cash either.    I award you ZERO STARS, grand view, and may God have mercy on your souls.",

We were greeted upon arrival and were seated immediately. Our server was quite pleasant and efficient. She provided drink refills and cleared our table as needed. Employees at the various stations were also quite pleasant. They keep all food items well stocked throughout the evening. The view of the river from the large picture windows was an added bonus.   There were various food stations available, including Asian (with stir-fried items which you select and have prepared while you wait), Italian, American, and BBQ. A large salad bar offered a variety of fresh salad items, along with soups and rolls. A carving station offered deliciously tender prime rib, as well as ham and turkey. The dessert station had a large variety of desserts attractively presented, with one dessert being served in small, plastic martini glasses. Several sugar-free desserts were also available, along with a nice variety of gelato.   We thoroughly enjoyed our meals and look forward to eating here again in the near future.",

We went here as a recovery meal after a long concert weekend.  It's worth $14.99 to eat on the patio or by the window alone, then you eat and realize this is what eating in heaven might feel like. Gazing out at the river either from my hangover or the beauty I couldn't help but think \"this is the best eggs Benedict and country fried steak I've had in a long time\", and that is just the tip of the ice burgh (yes with GH).    Awesome French toast, bacon by the boatload and all the eggs a bodybuilder needs, breakfast isn't the only option on this brunch buffet.  You want some general tso's at 11am? Go right ahead!  Sushi? Sure!  Pasta and Pizza, early carb session? Why not!  Better yet take my around the world for brunch tour and every plate get something different.  Eggs and bacon for one plate, and pesto on the next!  They also mix a pretty mean mimosa and for $6.99 you can even add some crab legs or prime rib!  End this journey with a trip through sweets and get the awesome creme brulee!!    Corporate entity or not, the Sunday Brunch Buffet is one to go out of your way for if you live or are visiting in Pittsburgh.  Never went on any other day, but I'm sure it's just as good.  When you're all done, hit up a table and win your money back!  Free lunch and a food time, win/win!!  (Unless you lose)",

    "text": "Friday night we arrived around 6pm. We beat the crowd that came around 630. It was just me and my husband. The buffet was $19.99 a person and that included your drink. There was a fresh salad bar, Italian, Mongolian, Asian, American, BBQ and desert sections. There was a decent selection of foods at each station. The biggest varieties were found at the salad bar, American, BBQ and deserts. I tried a little bit from each station. One of my favorite items was the winter antipasta salad. It was amazing with fresh mozzarella balls, parsnips, cherry tomatoes, onions and artichokes with a sweet balsamic dressing. From the Italian station I tried eggplant parm. That was probably my least favorite thing I had but still edible. They were refilling everything else and I'm not big on meat sauce so wasn't much that appealed to me here. The Mongolian station was create your own stir fry. My hubby got it and loved it. The Asian station had tasty little spring rolls that were fresh and crispy. I also tried beef and broccoli which was good. The American station had a bunch of different items to choose from. I had pierogies, potato skins but there were other items to choose from too. The BBQ station had prime ribs, keilbasa, bbq ribs which were so tender and good, among many other bbq favs and side dishes. I think you have to pay extra for the crab but we didn't do that. Someone near by had it and my husband commented it smelled fishy to him. It didn't look any better than something you could buy at th grocery store, not that is bad, but what do you expect at an all you can eat buffet? Desserts were so eye catching and tasty! The sorbets looked delicious. I only had room to try the mango and it was yummy. My hubby got the caramel bread pudding with the vanilla ice cream. He loved it. He really liked everything he had and he is a very particular person when it comes to food. I will say for $20, this is a good buffet. I'm not sure what people expect at buffets but it's not going to be all of the best foods you have ever eaten. If it is all good, then it should get a 5 star rating. Nice selection and fresh. Everything appeared to be clean and attended to. I liked that I could see the people prepping the food behind the stations. Nearly everything I tried I enjoyed. They had a lot of different soft drinks to chose from. The waitress had many tables but did come over to check on us a couple times and got us refills once. I would definitely come back here. The people that gave this bad reviews have too high of expectations for a buffet. It is not the bellagio but it definitely is far from bad and way ahead of ponderosa. I'd like to try brunch one time.",

The quality is almost non existent, the only thing there that tasted decent was the prime rib, everything else was sloppy and way over cooked. The sushi is frozen and not fresh, all the chicken dishes were nasty, overall it was just gross. I do not care to come back.",

    "text": "Certain things are a miss, others are a hit. It depends on your tastes, but I think that my observations here can be somewhat universal. I probably wouldn't pay the full $20 for dinner--either come at lunch for a reduced price, or come when they're offering specials (like BOGO January). I didn't find the Italian and Asian sections very impressive. The former consisted mostly of standard pizzas and cheesy pastas. The latter offered sushi with lots of rice and minimal fish; standard offerings of fried rice, lo mein, and stir-fried (overcooked) meats; and a \"Mongolian\" DIY stir-fry. Nothing much more than your standard bar or Chinese takeout food.  The \"American\" and \"Barbecue\" sections are better. There are sides ranging from potato skins to chili to mac and cheese to fill your pallet if you choose to do so, but you should really aim for the meats. The prime rib is where you get your money's worth, and when we were here it was done perfectly, tender and lots of flavor. They also had grilled catfish fillets, which were just as good. For more variety, they had ham and turkey as well.  The dessert options were surprisingly numerous, considering the limitations on the actual food. You could probably fill yourself up by eating one or two of each dessert offering (though obviously that's not recommended!). Some are hit or miss, though they were mostly above average. I quite liked the tiramisu and cream puffs--the lighter options. I found the baklava overly sweet, while the gelato was disappointingly lacking in texture. The cheesecake and chocolate cake were pretty standard. I didn't get to try any of the pies, though they looked like typical as well.  All in all, this isn't Vegas, but it's a casino buffet. Service was fine--plates were taken away and drinks refilled often enough. Again, just try to come here at a reduced price if possible.",

My friend and I went before the Steelers-Browns Game and they had a few items featured from Cleveland on the Buffett. Honestly, you can get those same items-perogies , sauerkraut, kielbasa in Pittsburgh-but how about an A for effort! They were really good for a buffet.   I feel like the Asian fusion side could have been a bit fresher like the rest of the food. For some reason, that side tasted too pre-prepped.   The dessert bar is amazing! Tons of different kids of dessert for everyone. The also have gelato! Go on Sunday's so you can get their mimosas for $1!",

Folks waiting with us said that the line was nothing, it was usually a lot longer.  And wouldn't you know, by the time we got to the front of the line, there were over 200 people in line behind us.  Western Pennsylvanian's do like a good buffet.  The interior furnishings are already starting to show wear.  The seats of many of the chairs are fairly worn and needs to be replaced.  Service here was fairly attentive considering the huge crowd.  And they keep your mimosas and bloody Mary's glasses full the entire time.  And crab legs for everyone.  Apparently, they were everyone's favorite.  For me, I was all about the peel and eat shrimp.  They were incredibly tasty and I couldn't get enough!  Another win win for me was the salad bar.  Very fresh, good dressings and toppings.  I went back a couple times.  As for the hot dishes, some were meh.  A little favor less, others a little cold.  The ham was great, the prime rib was a little rare for my taste.  But the dessert bar?  OMG, lots of tiny little yummy choices.  I wanted to take one of everything!    And what about our unsuccessful visit?  That was on Mother's Day.  And everyone was taking their Mother to the Grandview Buffet.  They had to be over 300 people in line!  So, we went elsewhere.  If you are going on a holiday, it's probably a good idea to go early!",

We gave our drink order at the register then were led to out table which was a booth on one side and chairs on the other the booth part faced the river. Once showed our seats it was time to dig in.   There are so many choices here. BBQ, Mongolian, Italian and more. I started off at the BBQ area and worked my way around. I can't say there was one thing I had that I just didn't like. It was all quite good. I love the Mongolian station. It's such fun to watch the guys cook. It might just be that I was so hungry everything tasted good or it might be that it was just that good. I don't think we actually had much of a conversation during dinner because I was more interested in food then my Bry.   Our waiter was everywhere. If there was an empty plate it was removed right away. If a glass got low there was a new one before it was empty. He was also very friendly and made the experience enjoyable.   This is a place I will definitely come back to. I would love to try there mimosa breakfast.",

It's indoors so in bad weather this is a plus also. But it is a long walk from the parking to the restaurant (s). You have to noodle your way through the maze of gambling machines and that is a little claustrophobic. The restaurant it's self is very neat and tidy and the food is displayed appetizingly. They're arranged in 5 stations, American, Asian,  Italian, salad/soups , and deserts. The prime rib that I had was great and was medium rare, although one they brought out later was a little more medium well. Most of the food I was perfectly happy with , with a few exceptions. There is enough variety to find something you like to eat. This is not a Michelin star restaurant, nor should you expect it to be, but my friend and I had good meals and rather above average deserts. Will go again.",

We hadn't come back in a while and when we did, the price dropped from $21.99 to $14.99 but no more crab legs or any seafood and no more prime rib! You can still get crab legs, but only a pound of them for $6.99 extra. Not only did they remove such beloved items, it tasted like the quality of the food has declined as well. The desserts seem to be the same which is the only reason why I gave it two stars. I'm not sure if it's different management taking on a different strategy or its their efforts to save money. Either way, it was disappointing and we will not be back. Sadly, not even for the desserts.",

Not that their dinner is bad but brunch is better with breakfast and regular food options and you get bottomless mimosas. Soooo who is to complain!? It's a bit pricey but if you like variety that's great. I love the crab legs. You can a stir fry dish made or a build your own pasta. I will say some of the food is bland or might not be as hot as you would like but this is kind of to be expected when going to a buffet and when you know you can do build your own dish options you can get piping hot food too. Also this is one if the only buffets I will even consider eating the sushi. And their sushi is good !  Give it a try!",

But all the food tastes like it has been frozen and simply microwaved and sauce poured on. They do have three sliced meats like turkey breast etc, but the guy behind the kiosk was so damned stingy. Literally last 30 minutes the place is open and I am one of the 10 customers there. And he gives me the tiniest half sliver of meat. I asked him for a bit more. He tells me I can't double dip. WTF man. You close in 30 min. The food is gonna be thrown out.  Unless it is used again the next day. Which wouldn't surprise me.  Don't bother with this place. Yes $15. But wasted $15.

They have everything you could ever want as far as the food goes, with many different sections - Italian, Mongolian, American, Barbecue, Asian and the best dessert bar you could ask for.   At the salad bar, that's where you can find many of the hidden gems of the buffet. Many great different pasta salads, the shrimp cocktail, and the buttery buns are all located there.  They have a great selection of sushi, and all the sauces you could ask for.   The crab legs are always scrumptious of course.  At the barbecue bar, you'll find many traditional favorites.. Mac'nCheese, ribs, and the pork loin are super good.  The ambiance is great for a buffet as well, located on the highest floor of the casino, with a wall full of glass windows showing the great view of Pittsburgh.  If you've never been and like buffets, GO!!",

The carving station had already carved on ham which was cold, turkey which was cold and dried out including the dark meat and a well done prime rib.

The temperature of the food was cold, I had Mac & Cheese & I didn't think it was possible to screw that up but guess what-Grand Buffet absolutely did!! The wait staff was very friendly but the hostess was extremely miserable-she should consider changing career, my husband had the BarBQ & said it was ruff to try & finish it, the chicken was hard & dry. I tried to find a Manager to express my concerns but ther was no one around, extremely disappointing",

The salad bar is really good and everything there is fresh.  I tried a roasted corn and edamame blend that was ice cold, and some very salty roasted turkey.  The carving station is great and the meats are cut to order.  And the desserts do not disappoint.  Definitely get the gelato!",

I'd say it was a good deal considering we usually spend about that for a dinner out.    The staff is very friendly.  We sat our receipt on the table as we made our way to the buffet and when we got back to our table, our drinks were sitting there ready for us.  Our server introduced herself and frequently checked to see if we needed refills on beverages and she was efficient in clearing our plates before we returned with newly loaded ones.  The variety was good I thought -- there are separate stations for different types of foods -- Italian, American, Salads, Asian, Desserts.  We asked waitstaff where we got plates and were given our instructions in a very friendly manner.  We immediately headed to the Asian station where a sushi chef helped us with salmon sushi and directed us to where we could get soy sauce and wasabi, then I loaded up on fried rice, some noodles, pork, and pot stickers and secured some chopsticks.  Next up was some salad, mashed potatoes, prime rib, and mixed vegetables.  Was too full for the Dessert section.    No complaints at all.",

It was cheap, buy one get one free. And it's a good thing because the food was not good. Other than the prime rib which was cut up in hunks, the next best thing was Salisbury steak. Which felt like it came out of a TV dinner. I will say that the desert bar was good and they had a really good ice cream selection. Gambling was what you expect from a casino.

My only complaint is against myself because it was a buffet I gave small tip, but my waitress Katie was on top of refilling our drinks and I could see she was running around like crazy and I wished I had left more,  but I paid with a card and there was no way to give more. They had a good variety of food and they had like 8 different types of ice cream at the dessert section of the buffet,  which I thought was impressive because most buffets only have a chocolate/ vanilla dispenser.   I would go back for sure.  The service was good and even though there was a long line we still got seated promptly.  There was even a bar area for customers who wanted an adult beverage.",

    "text": "Wow, Pittsburgh has had its share of great buffets, including the Grand Concourse, Hokkaido, the former Misaki and Tokyo Sushi Buffets, but Grand View Buffet is at the other end. I would dare Rivers Casino managers to eat there. There are a couple edible things but many that definitely aren't. There was a pot of \"mussels marinara\" and each mussel was shriveled literally to the size of a pencil eraser; they had obviously been cooked too long and sat in heat and air shriveling and shriveling for hours. \"Stir fry\" was looking pretty gray. \"Pasta\" dishes looked like and probably were just frozen stuffed shells with tomato paste dumped on top. And they too sat and sat, getting crustier with each passing hour. It's really hard to find anything worth eating despite the $20 price, and that's really sad. On the carving station, the \"prime rib\" was ok, but overcooked. The turkey looked completely overcooked and dry, I wouldn't even sample it. So some well-done prime rib, a little cottage cheese, a little macaroni and cheese, a couple pierogis, and some gelato, and a couple pieces of very badly made sushi with gummy sticky rice pressed way to hard into a dense chewy roll. That's not much of a dinner for $20 in Pittsburgh. Do yourself a favor, eat pretty much anywhere else either before or after a visit to the casino. Oh, side note. You can order a pound of crab legs for an additional $7. I didn't but they did actually look good, fresh and hot, unlike the other items on the buffet, but certainly no better than the crab legs at TJ Buffet that come with the $18 buffet versus this combination that Grand View will charge you $27 for.",

I don't recall having difficulty putting a quality meal together and always felt happy and full when I left.  I stopped coming because I'm just not a fan of the casino, in particular having to walk through the cigarette smoke infested room to get to your dining destination.   Well, fast forward to now, my dad and I were brainstorming where to go for Easter Brunch, which was fairly last minute at the time. We decided on this buffet. It was pretty fantastick and they had a great variety of foods. However, I noticed there were hardly any vegetables. And in fact, some of the ones ingot were dug out of other dishes.    I went again to take my dad for Father's day and there was a remarkable difference in both the quality and the selection of food items. Everything seemed a little more fast food-y and there was not a single veggie dish to be had (admittedly, there is the salad bar, but I am referring to cooked veggies).  In fact, the only veggies I was able to obtain on this visit were the ones I pulled out from other meat-centric dishes. While I'm no longer a vegetarian, I still love and want my vegetables.  Came again last night and again, the food screamed of low quality junk and thisntime there was ONE veggie dish they with sauteed zucchini, squash, and peppers, but it was hard as a rock. Now they did put a fresh one out later that was significantly better but seriously, when you're only offering ONE veggie dish, make it right.  I don't know. For the cost and the number of people feeding themselves there, I don't see why it needs to be so hit or miss, and also why the quality has to be so sub par.",

Our server was on the ball and kept our drinks refilled. All of the servers said hello anytime they saw us.  I particularly enjoyed the Mongolian Barbecue station. It was awesome being able to pick out exactly what I wanted to have cooked up.  The sushi options were legit and I loved the pot stickers, too.

I started off with the salad bar where check was pretty good. The buffet selection was horrible. All of us got our plates sat down and just stared. Was not happy with the selection or taste. We immediately got the manager and asked for a refund and went downstairs to the wheelhouse which is much better. That's a shame too. We used to come here all the time.

    "text": "Came here for the first time and had their weekend brunch for $15 per person.  What's Hot - Variety.  There's something for everyone.  There's Italian (with pastas, pizza rolls), sushi, Mongolian BBQ, a gelato bar, good variety of desserts, omelette station, etc...  There are a decent amount of veggie options, as well.  It's a casino buffet, so the variety is pretty good. - Price.  $14.99 for weekend brunch buffet, which is a very good price.  For the amount of food that you get, it's a pretty good tradeoff.   - Quality.  Hubby said their gelato is good.  I'm disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try the gelato bar.  I had some of their desserts, but didn't have enough room for the gelato.  The best desserts we tried were their baklava, cheesecake, and creme brulee.  Their omelettes are pretty good, too.     - Service.  Staff are nice; checked in regularly to make sure we had what we needed; and refilled our drinks accordingly.     - View.  I specifically asked for a table by the window with a view.  Definitely great and helped our group enjoy our meal that much more.  What's Not - Quality.  It's not the best food.  I've had better.  You're not paying for the quality of the food, you're paying for the volume and variety of food.  It's hit or miss, depending on what you pick.  For example, their sushi isn't the best.  Their sushi falls apart easily/isn't wrapped tightly and the flavor isn't very good.  Their Mongolian BBQ does NOT include noodles among your choices, which is something I've never come across before for Mongolian BBQ.  Their Asian dishes are not very well flavored and are pretty bland.  It looks like a lot of their food sits out for quite a while and is sometimes overcooked/too dry.  The food isn't bad, but it's not great.  It's not very flavorful and can be pretty bland, so be prepared for that.  Final Answer Willing to come back, but not a first choice.  Good value for money, but not the best quality food.",

They had many different types of food at different stations: Italian Mongolian Asian American Barbecue  Desert We both got a salad and the options for toppings were great and fresh.  My husband went for the American and barbecue. The kielbasa was great and then he also liked the potato skins, bbq chicken and sides. I had the Mongolian. Everything I had I liked the potstickers, spring rolls , beef. The fried rice was ok but much better when I added the sauce from the beef.  The deserts were so pretty! There was a hot chocolate truffle that was amazing and the peanut butter gelato yumm! I could've eaten the whole tub!  We will definitely be coming back to eat.",

    "text": "Let me preface my review saying I have only been here for the Sunday brunch so the weekday and evening buffet option probably differ.   The positives of this buffet are that there are lots of choices! A salad bar with soups is in the center of the buffet area. There is then a wall of different selections from one side of the room to the next: American, Asian, Mediterranean, Italian as well as a whole area dedicated to desserts. Now while I do enjoy having a lot of selections, a majority of the food is just mediocre at best. A lot of it is over cooked or under seasoned. I tend to stick with most of my tried and True favorites when I go, such as the cheese blintzes! Also the sushi is terrible! I'm a huge sushi fan but Grandviews reminds me of the horrible convenience store type of sushi. Stay far away! A place to come if your hungry but be prepared to fill up on average food.",

    "text": "I've heard about this place for a while, glad we were able to check it out! First, we arrived directly after a Steeler game. It was PACKED! So please note that my review is based on the fact that the buffet had 10,000 people there (must be a good thing, right?)  So the line to get in, TIP - if you have a card through the casino, you can pretty much skip the line (nice!) If not, plan to wait a few minutes if it is busy.  The restaurant itself has an AMAZING view of the city, the river, and the point state park (can't beat that)  I was impressed with the size of the buffets. There was a good bit of food for just about everyone. However, I couldn't get past the \"Golden Corral Vibes\" sure no one has heard that in a while, but it's True! Everything was very \"American-ized\" with Butter, cheese, etc. It would have been great to have a few vegan/non dairy selections available.   The buffet ranged from Asian, to Italian so there is definitely something for everyone.  I think my favorite part was definitely the dessert bar, they even had gelato!   Service was horrible, I think our waitress stopped by once. We had plates sitting around forever - no refills, etc. Like I said though, the place was jam packed.   I would be curious to check out the buffet on a not so busy Sunday.",

    "text": "Yo, this is a place that you will have a love/hate relationship with for a multitude of reasons.  You all know me, I never pass up a chance to gorge myself at a buffet, so when the better half suggested this place, I was down.  The pricing seems hefty for dinner, but in actuality, it's about the same price as going to a fancy restaurant and leaving hungry.  $20 for a dinner buffet isn't bad.  With the many different cuisine stations, there is no way to leave this place hungry.  Once you make your way through the paying process (you can leave a tip beforehand so in your after gorged state you can waddle out) you are escorted to a table, most times of your choice and set free to roam the range...I mean buffet.  Of course, and with any buffet I go to, I stopped at the salad station first.  Nice variety of vegetables and toppings of your choice.  You can easily fill up on salad here if you want.  I especially like that you aren't stuck with just iceberg lettuce as your base.  You also have your choice of the cold salads, i.e. potato, pasta, macaroni, Cole slaw, pickled beets and so forth.  After you finish with your salad then comes the daunting task of picking which way to attack the rest of the buffet.  You can start at one of the ends and make your way in the other direction or just go HAM on it and load that plate up like you're at an eating contest.  I took the first choice there.  I started at the barbecue end and made my way in the direction of foods.  I won't go into everything I ate here as it is a wide array of food.  Some of the food was amazing, some of it not so much.  The mac and cheese could have used something to make it less thick and maybe some type of seasoning.  The fried ravioli...change those things out if they are as hard as a brick!  I picked some up and topped them with some sauce and my knife could not cut through them.  I think that was a major problem here.  It was slow so the food selection didn't get changed out too quickly allowing the food to sit under the heating lamps and dry out.    Deserts were amazing.  I especially loved the chocolate chip cookies.  One suggestion here, and my better half also thinks this of the warm chocolate cake, have those little cartons of milk available.  I really could have gone for some milk with those cookies.  Even with that a few mishaps let's just say that I left here with my stomach distended and made myself uncomfortable for the rest of the evening and well into the early morning hours.  To touch on what I said at the beginning, I love that this is a buffet, I just hate how I feel for hours after I ate at this buffet.",

We all wanted mimosas as well m, so this was perfect.  For brunch, mimosas are $1 each or $6 for a pitcher. I decided to get two for now since they said one pitcher is about 6 mimosas so it is the same price. I am glad I only ordered two, because the mimosas did not taste like they had much champagne on them. I asked the waiter if he could go easier on the orange juice and he suggested just getting champagne. It was only a dollar too! I wish I would have known that from the beginning lol  The buffet itself has a lot of variety. You can get a made to order omelette, desserts, steak, waffles eggs. They also have cultural food like Asian and Italian. Don't forget the salad bar :-)   For the price of brunch and the amount of food you receive, I would definitely come back here on my visit home.",

They have a lot of options from American Classics to made for you Mongolian BBQ. I loved the fact that they had sushi as well. It was decent for a buffet. Nothing too special here but decent (Spicy Tuna, Salmon Cucumber, California Roll, etc.) I stuck with mostly the Asian options sampling the Sushi, General Tso's Shrimp, Pot Stickers and Fried Rice. All good. I also went for the Mongolian BBQ which is made to order. You select your ingredients and sauce. The Szechuan Beef with Peppers, Onions, Mushrooms and Bean Sprouts was very tasty. I really enjoyed their actual salad bar as well. Everything appeared very fresh and there were many options. In fact, I wish they offered an option for just the salad bar itself at a lower cost.  This is a good option if you are looking for a buffet in the area. It's going to be a step above a Golden Coral in quality and options but not fine dining by any means.  I have to mention the view of the river as well. It is very nice.  Check it out for yourself!",

If you're starving but not exactly sure what food you're in the mood for, throw on your stretchy pants and come to Grand View. What I love is that they offer a little bit of everything. Whether you're in the mood for pizza, pasta, sushi, or just 50 scoops of gelato, they'll have it. It's about $20 a person which is slightly more expensive than alternatives. The quality of the food is not great, honestly. As with most buffets, food left out can get dry or stale. I'm the biggest sushi nut, but their sushi is horrendous. I personally enjoy the brunch buffet because 1) it's cheaper and 2) more vegetarian friendly options.   Don't forget to cash in on your free meal on your birthday!",

The line to get in was a mile long but so worth it.   Every station was well stocked, hot dinner plates and eager cooks to help. Food was properly prepared very tasty & delicious !!  All the station had something for everyone's taste. The dessert station was over flowing with awesome treats.   I enjoyed the salad station and the Asian station.   The dining room was full in every chair, it it was easy to move around the stations.   As we finished our dinner and left for the evening the line to get in was as long as when we first arrived.   I have been to many casino buffets in Vegas and Atlantic City as well as Canada and beyond, it isn't as lavish, but Rivers Casino Grand View Buffet offers excellent food at a good price. The add ones are pricy but worth it. The cocktail bar offers liquors and wine at a reason price as well.   Highly recommend and we will return !!",

We did add on the crab legs and they were really good. The prime rib was also very good, but the rest was gross. I have to mention the sushi, they seriously throw the sushi in a bin, it is all mixed up just tossed together like a salad. I really have never seen any thing quite like it.

    "text": "I am actually very pleasantly surprised of the experience I had here. I would not pay this much for buffet normally, I saw their special deal for rush reward members can eat buy one get one free Monday thru Thursday. Therefore, me and my boyfriend came on a week day. We forgot our rush reward member card and the lady insists without physically seeing the card they wouldn't get us a discount. I went down to the player service to get a replacement of the card and we successfully got in.  For me, the highlight of the experience is their desserts. OMG, everything in the dessert section is so tasty, I got way too much desserts. The food selection was great, from salad bar, to American food, Asian food, Mongolian stir fry, and Italian. Everything was good but nothing is outstanding I guess. The service was great, and efficient. I would definitely come back again.",

It's huge inside so the line goes fast if they have one at all. The buffet is organized by section: Italian, Asian, American...   I love to try some from each section. My favorite is the sushi bar and stir-fry. The stir-fry is made to order. The sushi is pre-made, but they have a variety of rolls even vegetables ones for me! I also love the carving station. The turkey is always very juicy as my sister loves the prime rib. Don't forget to stop by the desert table for the mocha no bake cheesecake.",

    "text": "The food was ok. I ordered the crab legs for an extra $7. When we were seated, I asked the server immediately if I could wait a little while for my crab legs because I wanted to get a plate first. She said absolutely, she wouldn't put in the order until I asked for them. So I got my salad plate of 4 things and sat down and bam, there was another girl with my crab legs. They were waterlogged and barely warm. The butter was cold. I gave my husband one and he said they taste funny, do you think they are overdone. I said I am not sure but they are bad. So this other girl came by and was cleaning up beside us and said hi and asked me if everything was ok. I said yes and then asked her if she was the manager and she said no but she could get him.  He came over and I wanted to explain to him about how I thought they might be bad but as soon as I said I think there is something wrong, he said, well what as I can't exactly see when there isn't much left there.  THERE was more than half left.  Then he said, I can't comp you on something that isn't there. I said, wow, I didn't want you to comp anything and he THEN SAID to me, well we did have a problem with the crab legs tonight and had to get some from the restaurant downstairs and I said well no wonder because they are bad. I said I am so sorry I bothered you, I just wanted you to know they were bad. Then 1/2 hour later I got so sick and spent the next 40 minutes in the bathroom. Never going back there and didn't spend a penny in their casino either!  Next time Mr. \"Manager\" you should listen to what your customer is trying to tell you!  Hope not to many people got sick for lousy crab legs.",

    "text": "We ate  t the buffet with a large party( 35ish)  for the Sunday Brunch. I was trying to contact them to make a reservation but they do not accept reservations.  When we arrived there was a HUGE line, however it went quickly( about 20 minutes) and the staff  was able  to seat us all in one section! I was happily impressed.  They seemed to assign  additional waitstaff to us as we were never with out  beverages( including the mimosas!) and the plates were always cleared.   On to the food.. OH MY the food: prime rib, turkey, ham, stir fry, pizza, salads, peel and eat shrimp, crab legs,made to order omelets, bacon, eggs, pastas, etc.. so many wonderful and fresh choices. Then there is a whole  table of desserts in small bite portions!    One thing to note- when you have a large party they will automatically  add an 18% gratuity, which was no big deal for us as they deserved more!",

    "text": "Went to the casino for the first time on Friday, the 20th , for the sole purpose of having the buffet. What a mistake! For over $42.00 (paid for a friend) I encountered food not fit for the garbage dump. There was not one item that was not old, cold or dry. Only one seafood item, an awful looking mess, labeled tilapia. Apparently, the price for this swill has been fluctuating over the past few months and seems to be missing the mark. The quality of this buffet puts it squarely in the $8.99 to $10.99 range depending on how many items are actually edible. I cannot believe Rivers Casino would allow this embarrassment to exist. In comparison, Golden Corral is fine dining. I mentioned the poor quality to our \"server\" and she agreed it was bad and business has fallen off considerably. Rather than bringing the manager to the table she suggested I find him on the way out if I wished to complain. I didn't bother since I wasn't looking for a freebie and if the manager remotely cared the situation wouldn't exist in the first place. If you plan on going to the casino, for the buffet,  do yourself a favor and eat somewhere else. Anywhere else!!!",

For some reason, I have been to every restaurant at the casino EXCEPT for the buffet, and I definitely wasn't disappointed. There were so many different options to pick from and there was something for everyone. The crab legs were exceptional, and I was a fan of the Italian fritatta (reminded me of my uncles making it for a family breakfast feast) along with the healthy veggie options everywhere! I would definitely go back, but maybe not until I work off the 5 pounds I gained yesterday!! :)",

Main courses ranged from pastas, Chinese, Crab legs and salads.  Crab legs are snow crab. Lots of work. Some of the Chinese food was good. Steamed dumplings were good. Ribs needed more spices and some sauce on the side. Some of the pasta was good, some did not look worth tasting. \"prime\"rib was cooked properly and pretty good for a buffet.  Deserts were good. Warm chocolate cake was tasty. Creme Berle was good. Gelato was not outstanding but pleasant.",

    "text": "I've been to the Grandview Buffet a couple times for breakfast and once for dinner, and frankly I'm surprised at the poor/inconsistent food quality. At the breakfast buffet there was plenty of food, but none of it was very appealing, several trays of scrambled eggs were cooked inconsistently. One tray was runny, another rubbery. Sausage patties seemed to have been boiled, none of them was significantly browned. Bacon on the other hand was nearly all burnt in one tray, yet flaccid in another. And there weren't any lighter foods on the buffet (fruit salad would have been a nice alternative), only two types of sausage, bacon, scrambled eggs, cold toast, and sweet pastries. Dinner however was worse. BBQ items were tasteless (no rub, no sauce, no salt...) but heavy on the artificial-tasting  smoke flavor, which was quite unpleasant. There were only a few kinds of sushi, they were small and not very appealing. Italian pasta dishes looked dried up and neglected, though it wasn't a wierd hour or very late, only 6pm. Oddly they had a man working full time behind the salad bar and a woman working behind the pastry bar, despite very little business at those two stations. All in all I had the impression that the place is run to visually impress people rather than to have consistently wonderful food. I doubt their chefs and managers would want to eat at this buffet.",
