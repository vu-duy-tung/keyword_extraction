If you don't like margarine you're out of luck, and they definitely don't care, either, they took quite an attitude about it when asked.  How hard is it to buy some single serves and keep them in the refrigerator for those who ask?",

    "text": "I had been looking to visit this place for breakfast for over a year.  I had seen some of their adds on social media and the food looked pretty good.  I even had a friend who swore by the place.  So today I finally had the chance to go out to Dormont.  It took well over a half hour to get there but that's not why I give this place three stars.  The food was just okay.  I had the pumpkin pancakes and my husband and I split the the southwestern omelet which is supposed to be the highlighted dish from Guy Fieri's show Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  The omelet was basic and as un-stuffed as an omelet could be.  Very little meat,  basic bland cheese, and very undercooked peppers and onions topped off with salsa from a jar.  Very dissapointed to say the least.  The potatoes were cooked nice and crisp but lacked any seasoning or flavor.  The pumpkin pancakes were flavorful and filling.  By the time the server brought me butter they were luke warm but mostly enjoyable anyway.  Did  I mention the coffee yet? Straight gross.  Not for me at all.  I thought that our server brought us old coffee and thus the bitter taste but our refill from a fresh pot produced the same queesy feeling and difficulty in swallowing it down.  Oh yeah, the server was inefficient which is something I could overlook had she even been kind. She wasn't kind or friendly until she dropped off our check.  We won't go back.  I will stick to Pamelas or the Gateway Grill.",

    "text": "Located up Potomac from the hotel my girlfriend and I were staying at, and just past the train stop into downtown, Dor-Stop was an easy choice for breakfast when doing my pre-trip food research. Getting its name from the bedroom community it's located in, Dormont, it benefits from a charming mini-downtown area immediately around it, as well as lots of brick houses, although some have seenbetter days.   Dor-Stop is diner chic through and through, serving the breakfast and lunch crowds only. Nic nacs and local sports teams' placards adorn the walls, as well as a proudly displayed signed poster from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives after that show's stop here. A mix of booths, tables and a few counter seats could cram several dozen people in.  You don't have to do any research about what's popular here, just take a look at a good chunk of the menu or what the person next to you is eating: the hotcakes. With a dozen options, there's a lot of choice and they're all tempting. I settled on the apple walnut hot cakes with sausage on the side. We didn't have to wait long but it felt like a while hungrily watching all the delicious looking food come out of the open kitchen or sitting in the window.  Once in front of me, I was staring at three thick hot cakes with apples chunks and walnuts cooked into them and topped with icing sugar, along with two sausage rounds. The hot cakes were utterly fantastic, with a pleasing denseness but with just enough air in them to keep them from being chewy, The apples were cooked perfectly, soft but not mushy, and along with the walnuts added some texture. I was initially disappointed that the sausage came in round form instead of links as they tend to be drier, but these were nicely browned and still juicy, albeit a bit too greasy.   My girlfriend went for the lunch time food, getting the Chick 'O' Philly hoagie  which came with sliced chicken breast, sauteed mushrooms, onions and green peppers, tomato lettuce and Swiss cheese. It was a winning combination of ingredients and the thick bun made for a even heftier sandwich, and as a good sandwich should be it was greater than the sum of its parts. The fries it came with were a solid entry - lightly browned, thick cut but still nice and crispy.   On a return trip, I went with the plain hot cakes and they were just as good as the apple walnut ones, a sign of great fundamentals when you're doing something as seemingly basic as a hot cake. Kudos.   Service was friendly and attentive, with a ton of coffee top ups. You'll be challenged to get past half empty in your cup at any point in the meal.  Dor-Stop seemed like just a convenient spot to fuel up for a day of tourism but turned out to be a damned good spot with memories of its own: the best pancakes I've ever had.",

    "text": "Hands down one of the best breakfast spots in Pittsburgh.  Okay, maybe the best.  I can't say the best for sure, though, because I haven't made my way through then entire list of breakfast places around the city.  But I'm working on it, though.  (I even have a spreadsheet.)  I've had everything from the pancakes to the eggs burrito to daily specials.  I always know it's going to be delicious, I'm going to struggle to finish the portions and I will leave happy both with my meal and the bill.  I'd like to be able to recommend one thing over another, but I really can't.  Everything I've eaten at The Dor-Stop has been a great and satisfying breakfast.  The pancakes are sweet, the bacon is always crisp and I can't find anything bad to say about an omlet special that includes bologna (aka jumbo).    I guess my best recommendation has nothing to do with menu items: go on a weekday.  Weekends this place is hopping and there will likely be a wait.  Sure, it will be worth it, but if you can swing by early on a weekday you won't have to and the food will be just as good.  A friend of mine will call me now when she has to take her car to the dealership on West Liberty Avenue because she knows I will take her to the Dor-Stop.  It makes me feel all warm and fuzzy to share one of my happy places with a friend so it can be one of her happy places, too.",

Had no idea that the Christmas Parade was about to pass by, no wonder there were so many people standing around!  Our 4 year old hears the sirens and realizes Santa is coming, but we just placed our order.  Uh oh.  The staff puts our order on hold, and tells us to go outside to see Santa.  We watch the parade for a few minutes, and when we go back inside, our order hits the table the same time as us.    I know there is a wait for tables most mornings, so it was especially nice of them to be so accommodating and child-friendly.

I guess it does have an old, greasy spoon charm but that doesn't justify the trek halfway across town. There are definitely much better places in Pittsburgh.   Waitress also weirdly loud and attitude-y, I'm sure she thought she was being very friendly and just kidding around and being friendly - but she walked a fine line between teasing and being self righteously indignant towards  my husband for not 'treating me right and paying attention to me' then went on to ask me why other Indian women wear black gowns that cover everything and eat through slits in their mouth holes and don't say a word. I felt more like she was on a crusade to save me and my brown skinned self from my 'ignorant' husband than serving us breakfast and leaving us in peace to enjoy the morning.   May be great for other people, but not my kind of breakfast experience. Maybe I can't take a joke?  *   Thought back on this experience a lot - I'm editing my review to local neighborhood food hole with racist undertones.",

The seating is kind of cramped however I get it because it's a small dinner. I was anxious to go because it had been featured on the Food Network. I can say that I was not disappointed with my omelette nor was I disappointed with my boyfriend's raisin bread french toast lol. He also got Circle sausage partties. He said the eggs were superb! I ordered the South of the Border omelet. Being a Southern girl I wanted to make sure that the Omelette would stand up to its name. The omelette was large in size and came with some homemade potatoes. The omelette was tasty it was wrapped with sausage and different vegetables which was good with cheese and salsa on top. Yummy to say the least however I would have preferred some sour cream with it as well. (I was so hungry i didn't bother to ask) I gave this place four stars for the good, quick, friendly, tasty, service I received. It was IHOP prices with the home feel.",

What we got were heavy, strangely orange-colored (in honor of the new president), heavily dense to the point of chewy and oversweet strangeness. I've never had anything like them, and hesitate to criticize because I'm not sure this is not the way they are supposed to be. Or if the cook was just off. See the huge benefit of the doubt I'm giving here--if I'd stopped in off the street I would have savaged the quality of the food, but this place is supposed to be legendary. I don't get it. It took me 4 cups of coffee and two glasses of water before I finally gave in, and I have NEVER left even a bite of pancake on a plate before in all 50 of my years. Now, the more time passes the worse those pancakes get in my memory. Too bad.  All that said, the morning waitress was charming, attentive, and very easy on the eyes, the shop was fastidiously clean, and the coffee was strong and tasty. The sausage was delicious, the bacon average. Normally I'd write a place like this off, but the service was so great, the other reviews so good and, frankly, the pictures of the sandwiches and other items so good looking that I'll probably give it another go.",

Having been featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, it has become a well known place to enjoy the mornings and afternoons of the weekend. Located on a quaint street in Dormont, Dor-Stop is always full to the brim with awaiting customers.   I ordered a plate full of gooey chocolate pancakes with a side of sausage patties and lyonnaise potatoes. The pancakes were so, so delicious. They were thick and dense, but weren't too thick that they were difficult to eat. The sausage patties were cooked just right. They were juicy, and greasy, and simply amazing. The lyonnaise potatoes were a nice addition. They are my favorite type of potato. My boyfriend got Guy's version of the jumbot. It was loaded with hot sausage, potatoes, eggs and peppers. He loved it, and so did I!   The atmosphere of Dor-Stop is that of a typical diner. Various memorabilia and other types of old-time posters adorn the walls, which makes for a very comfortable feel. The service was great for being so busy, and we only had to wait a short amount of time for our food.   I definitely plan on coming back here as soon as possible to try the other great options on the menu. The raspberry stuffed French toast looked amazing!",

I've been asked why I have it only 3 stars with such a glowing review. Well, I don't prefer greasy spoon joints, but if it's your thing u will like it!   What makes this greasy spoon joint different than others is the amazing variety of pancakes and french toasts- you will not get bored with your breakfast here! As a standard on the menu, they have many flavors to choose from: pumpkin, banana, blueberry, choco chip, raspberry, etc. I ordered the special of the day: chocolate cherry cheesecake pancakes. They were pretty good! I liked that there were actual cherry pieces in the filling- I appreciate real fruit being used in my breakfasts. If u like a pancake that holds up against the weight of toppings and syrup, while maintaining a soft spongey texture, you will like these. I hate when pancakes get immediately soggy- these do not!   The boyfriend ordered Bob's specialty, as it is not a standard breakfast item either- eggs with German potato pancakes, applesauce, and sour cream- it did not disappoint! The potato pancakes were a tad on the sweet side, but I liked them.   Another great thing here is the down-home feel of the place- everyone is very friendly. While we were waiting in line (which by the way, wasn't too long, they get people in and out pretty fast), they handed out small samples of coffee. This was much appreciated on such a cold day!",

The sausage was gross, it had almost no flavor and there was at least one gross piece in it that made a weird crunch sound between my teeth. the biscuit was extremely dry and absolutely no flavor. the home-fries were more like mash potatoes. I will never return and I live within walking distance.",

I ordered something akin to a breakfast sampler, eggs, bacon, tater pancakes.  My friend ordered the raspberry french toast.   The coffee, as others have stated, was a bottomless cup. Quite tasty too, as compared with many restaurants that will serve you the dregs of Folgers that essentially serve as methadone to the caffeine connoisseur/addict such as myself.  The french toast stole the day, it was hearty and delicious, with a yogurt/syrup topping. Definitely an indulgence. I did not give this 5 total stars as my eggs were slightly bland, and I love eggs. I will return to this marvelous establishment that really serves as a gem in Pgh neighborhood eating.",

On a road trip I recently took with my family, it was literally the only breakfast place that disappointed us and did not live up to its hype.  Got the \"famous\" Ham from the Bone breakfast. Without a doubt, it was definitely good and a solid item to order, but it didn't blow me away. Wish I had tried Guy's version instead of the original...  My wife ordered two eggs over easy and they were undercooked, to the point of pretty much being raw. Gross. Breakfast places should know how to properly cook eggs.  We split Lori's Stuffed French Toast, which everybody loves. Again, definitely a delicious and solid item to order, but didn't leave me speechless or anything of that sort.  At the end of the day, you don't HAVE to go here. It's not a MUST. If you do go, you will get a more or less solid breakfast that is above average. Again, I don't think it's worth the wait or lives up to its hype, but I'm a foodie and know mind blowing food when I eat it.",

I was severely hungover and just needed some grease, and the concierge at my mother's hotel happened to recommend this place.  The restaurant is \"cozy\" (read: small) and situated in a really quaint neighborhood at the top of a massive (and somewhat scary) hill. The restaurant itself was buzzing and had a great neighborhood vibe. Despite it being *packed,* we were seated right away.  The menu wasn't too fussy but there were a lot of options. I ordered the dor-stop burger (burger with sauteed onions and green peppers, american cheese and two slices of texas toast) and fries. My husband got the mushroom swiss burger with onion rings and we split our meals. The food was simple enough but amazingly delicious. I think they battered the onion rings in crack. I also ordered an orange juice, which I could tell was fresh squeezed.  The portion sizes were reasonable too! Not gigantic, which I appreciate. I finished my meal feeling like a brand new woman.   I think I'll look for reasons to come to Pittsburgh now that I know this restaurant exists. Yum.",

In addition to that lesson, the you will experience the following: -Hotcakes so good you don't need to add syrup (mine were oatmeal raisin, like eating the amazing hybrid of a cookie and pancake) -Potato pancakes so good that you'll wish you had multiple orders -Slabs of ham. So good.  Add in the great service, ease to find parking, and decent prices and this place is truly a gem. Don't let the wait scare you unless you have a large group - people flow out of there pretty quickly, and for 2 people on a Sunday we only had to wait 10 minutes (and they gave us free samples while we waited).

I should have just stuck with the pancakes on my last visit but I went with a meatloaf sandwich instead.  It was just average and didn't really have any taste. It came with mashed potatoes which were definitely from a package. I always wondered why this place didn't stay open later now I see why, everything that isn't a pancake is a failure.   The worst part of this last visit was the service. We arrived and the place was half empty and we were seated at a table. The waitress was just kind of like what do you want, now I don't expect every place to be trader joe's type happy but don't act like we are bothering you for coming here. She took our order and that was last we saw of her. Someone else brought out the food and no one ever came back to check on us. I could see the waitress go over to her other table (she only had 2 tables) and check on them multiple times. We didn't get any refills on our drinks and every time I tried to motion to her she would turn her back and sit at the counter and talk with the other waitress. We never even received our check and had to go to the counter and ask for it our self. We were then told to wait because they needed to check someone else out first. After standing there for a couple minutes we were then given our check. No apologies or anything.  I won't be back.",

Order texas toast, two eggs over easy and a side of hollandaise sauce. Then build your own eggs benedict. Saves a vegetarian about $2 on a main which is great!     I would give it four stars if it weren't for the insane busy-ness of this place. It would be really great if they could expand. They also could really use chairs and benches outside for people who are waiting. I'm sure it's better during the week, but as a 40 hour a week working couple, weekends are the only time we can make it there.",

    "text": "To be honest, I really don't understand all the hype about Dor-Stop. Maybe it's the fact that it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dive? Or it gives you that small town, homey diner feel? None the less, I have definitely experienced better.  We stopped in on a Saturday morning to meet my brother in law's family for breakfast. They arrived 10 mins earlier than us and were able to get seated right away. Because there were 9 of us, they had to accommodate accordingly in their small facility so things around our table were a bit cramped. No big deal though, it's understandable.   Dor-Stop is known for their pancakes but because I am not fan, I opted for the Potato Pancake breakfast which came with 2 potato pancakes and 2 eggs, cooked to your liking. You are able to add a side of meat for $2. I added bacon with mine. Our food took quite some time to come out. There were 2 tables that came in after us that received their meals before us. Kind of irritating as we're all on the verge of getting hangry, but we assumed they're holding some plates behind so they could bring all of our meals out together. I really wasn't too impressed with my meal. The potato pancakes were good but they're very greasy as was the bacon. I had to use a napkin to soak up some of the excess grease. The eggs were good though. They're light and fluffy which is how I like my eggs to be when scrambled.   The staff member who was refilling our coffee was very nice, our waitress though, was not. She was not very attentive and never had a smile on her face. She got an attitude when my husband asked for an orange juice to go and snatched our check off the table because she had to add another OJ to it. This could've been easily fixed if she were to ask if any of us needed anything else before bringing our checks out. He also asked for a to go box in which he never received it. My brother in law's mother had to go up to the counter to get her box because our waitress didn't bring hers either.. Maybe it was because she was too busy chatting in the corner with another staff member to even pay attention.  All in all, it wasn't a very pleasant experience and I was not impressed, which is quite upsetting since I've heard many great things about it.",

Second time, we got smarter and still went on the weekend, but earlier- 8am. Yes, rolling out of bed early on the weekend is a pain, but well worth it.   The first time I ordered the Eggs Benedict and from my memory it was a must-try, I would order again. Today, I got the Banana Walnut Hotcakes and they were perfect! The bananas were fresh and visible, and there were just enough chopped walnuts so it wasn't underwhelming or overwhelming.   The service is great. Our waitress was very attentive, and always around for drink refills, but not the annoying \"always stopping by\". She also made sure to grab the box that I almost forgot as we were leaving because the portions are huge. Overall, outstanding traditional diner in the South Hills.",

    "text": "Well, looks like I'm adding yet another 5-star review for Dor-Stop. But hey, they definitely deserve it! In fact Dor-Stop is so good that I came here two days in a row a couple weekends ago - once for a sit-down meal, and once to get a meal to-go just so I could try a second item on the menu.  I actually hadn't eaten at Dor-Stop in years until earlier this month - their hours and my schedule don't tend to mesh. But one afternoon I just happened to be using 1/2 a vacation day, so I came with a family member. Since it was the middle of the day on a Friday, the place was fairly empty, which I definitely didn't mind - this place is pretty cozy and so it gets cramped quickly during weekend dining rushes.  But on to the food, the important part of this review! My dining companion ordered a salad - complete with French fries, 'cause that's how we do salads in Pittsburgh - and I ordered their Feta Burger. Sure, their Raspberry stuffed french toast caught my eye...but Feta burger! How often do you see that on the menu? And I loved that burger, by the way - it was well cooked and the toppings blended perfectly (I snagged a few mushrooms from my companion's salad which made it even better), and definitely felt like good diner food. I left feeling super happy with my meal.  Buuuuut...the next day I still couldn't get that french toast of my mind. I just couldn't. So I called in an order for pick-up - good thing I did, too, because there was nowhere to sit when I came in! Saturdays are definitely jam-packed here, understandably so. Well, I got my food, brought it home, and proceeded to devour it. Just, YUM! Seriously - that french toast is a MUST!  If I was going to complain about anything it would be that the seating really isn't the most comfortable on the planet, buuuuut...I can't hold it against them. I just can't. Not after that french toast. See you next time, Dor-Stop!",

    "text": "I've only been here once (yesterday) for breakfast.  I noticed that this place opens really early (6am) on weekdays so I had thought it would be a nice idea to get down to the Dor-Stop on our way out of Pittsburgh.  I was able to find parking on the street and the meters don't take effect until after 8am.  We had arrived around 7:35 so I figured we'd have enough time before I had to feed the meter.  There was only 2 other customers at the bar when we arrived.  We had our choice of seating and we had chosen to sit near the window.  Coffee up and ordered and our server was back consistently to make sure our coffees were filled.  On the table we noticed they had non dairy creamer and since both my wife and I aren't fans of non dairy creamer we had asked if we could have a small serving of milk and our server brought that over right away.  Being our first time I had to go through the menu to see what I was wanting.  I didn't want to eat too much since I had to drive back home but I did find something of interest.  My wife usually gets steak and eggs but she didn't this time.  I had sort of wanted her to get that so I could have some steak but she went with the ham and eggs with German potato pancakes and white toast.    I had gone with the all American which was 1/3lb burger, eggs, and lyonese potatoes which is basically homefries with onions with toast.  I also ordered a side of bacon.  I noticed the side of bacon was 3.10 which is kind of a lot but they gave me probably 6 slices or more.  I'm used to only getting 3 or 4 slices usually.    We didn't order anything that they could impress us with I suppose.  It's not like we went with an item like hotcakes or a skillet or anything like that just a relatively conservative breakfast.  I did have some of my wife's potato pancakes and ham and they were both very good.  My breakfast was just as I expected nothing out of the ordinary but still very good.",

    "text": "I hate to be the one to say it, but this place is super over-hyped.  First, despite having an open kitchen, the restaurant was freezing last weekend.  Sure, it was only ten degrees out.  But everyone in the restaurant was wearing their jackets, which is uncomfortable when you are trying to eat.  Second, the service was pretty bad.  Our waitress never came over to refill coffee or check on the meal.  She took our orders and dropped the food off with an attitude.  That was it.  So how was the food?  Despite being featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives, which they point out on the menu, the food was just standard diner food.  I split the Egg Burrito ($8.59) and the Apple Cinnamon Hot Cakes ($6.59).  The hot cakes were the very large winner with a  unique and dense batter.  I enjoyed the apples throughout the batter very much.  The egg burrito, unfortunately, was really lackluster.  It was a flour tortilla filled with sausage, potatoes, scrambled eggs, and cheddar cheese and then smothered in salsa.  While it looked good in appearance, it was mostly a bunch of potatoes.  I saw one piece of sausage in the whole thing.  It lacked any flavor and would have really benefited from some hot sauce.  I wouldn't go out of my way to come back here, and if I was back in the neighborhood, I would rather Tom's Diner across the street.  The Dor-Stop is A-OK but nothing special.",

    "text": "The Dor-Stop had perfectly fine diner food, but definitely not a frontrunner for breakfast food or diner food in the Pittsburgh area.  The diner was packed on a Saturday morning and we had about a 15 minute wait. The staff was great at expediting the process of greeting customers when they came in and getting them on the waitlist/calling names. The dining area is definitely cramped, but tables/booths were very clean.  Our table ordered cinnamon rolls, the jumbot eggs (basically a hash), eggs, bacon, sausage, and several different kinds of pancakes. None of the pancakes were great--they have a very dry and tough exterior and a soft center. The dryness/toughness of the cooked exterior, however, basically demands that you drown them in pancake syrup, but they're already pretty sweet to start with, so it just gets gross. The child at our table did not eat more than two forkfuls of the chocolate-chip pancakes.  The fruit-filled pancakes (apple and banana) had great flavor, but again, they pancake itself just wasn't good. The hash was very dry and didn't have much flavor, in spite of advertising itself as having both hot sausage and jalapenos. Eggs, bacon, and sausage were fine, but definitely nothing special.  The cinnamon roll was delicious--soft and tender even at the edges, gooey, and with strong cinnamon flavor.  The coffee was absolutely terrible, which, well, I mean. We're ok with that. Diner coffee is diner coffee. Always disappointed to see the little individual containers of half-and-half, though.  Our server was nice and efficient, but definitely not attentive (offered our only water refill while delivering the check for example). The place was very crowded, so she was definitely busy.   It was fun to visit a new breakfast place and check this one off of our list, but we won't be back.",

I would be at Dor-Stop all the time if they had the sausage gravy on demand.  Note: This is not the norm and the waitress seemed to be having a bad day. The only problem I have ever really had was when one of the waitresses didn't put forth much effort. She never stopped by to fill our drinks. Asked for our order and that was it. Even though we were friendly and polite, we never received the same in return. I understand that people have bad days. The waitresses here are very nice, but they are human and have their off days. Like I said, this was only one time, and on a subsequent visit, she was much more cheery and friendly. Everyone is human.

You can usually expect a bit of a wait, but it's totally worth it. The french toast is my favorite but really everything is good. I love the local, friendly diner ambiance. The servers are all great. If you're really lucky and they like you enough, you might even get to taste to specials before you order. Do yourself a favor and try the Dor-Stop. You'll be hooked!",

    "text": "I have to be honest, I have heard that this place has great potato pancakes but I couldn't care less. Why? Because I eat the same thing every single time I eat there. I have no time to be bothered by some silly pancake when there is serious business, in the form of eggs benedict, that needs taken care of. The eggs benedict at The Dor-Stop is just the way I like it. I feel like so many breakfast spots serve benedicts of all sorts that are usually quite small, have very little hollandaise and are served with a salad. Maybe I am the odd one out in all of this but I cringe when I see a salad served with breakfast foods. I go out to breakfast to eat unhealthy, artery clogging deliciousness. If I wanted to concern myself with veggies I would stay at home and save my money and eat at home. Anyways, their eggs benedict consists of the diner's ham off the bone, two eggs, mancini's bread and a pool of delicious hollandaise. There is no stinginess when it comes to this meal. Everything is heavy handed. In addition to the huge eggs benedict, there is a beautiful mountain of potatoes that comes with it. Everything about this dish is how it should be. Total perfection.b",

I enjoyed the cute small town diner atmosphere. It's definitely cozy, so if you're not a fan of being seated near others I would recommend somewhere else.

When my mother and I went into the restaurant we were not acknowledged  and had to ask to be seated. Then we were then signaled to take our seats in a booth.   The waitress avoided all eye contact with us while we placed our orders. She had another waitress deliver our food which took an hour.  The waitress neglected to check up on us or ask if we would like a refill on our drinks. When she did finally come over was to simply give us the check, which was not asked for at that time and then she walked away.   We paid our check and even provided the waitress with a tip which she took from my hand and walked away without a thank you.   The waitress was pleasant with everyone else just didn't know why my mother and I received such horrible service.",

It was a weekday at around 11am, and the place was still packed. I sat at the counter after a brief wait, because it was the only available seat in the house. The gentleman next to me, as it turns out, is related to the restaurant owner. He gets a five-star review, but I swear I'm not even taking that into account with my official five-star Yelp rating.  The wait staff was very busy, but also attentive. Great mix of friendly and efficient. I couldn't decide what to order - everything sounded amazing. I ended up getting banana chocolate chip pancakes with bacon. The pancakes were probably the best I've ever tasted. A little crispy on the outside, fluffy on the inside. I used ZERO syrup. I prefer my bacon a little crispier, but it was still good.  I'll be back to sample a more lunch-y entree. In the mean time, though, five stars for sure!",

I decided to try the chocolate chip & banana pancakes, they were very tasty, but got a bit mushy in the center, they weren't undercooked they were just loaded with bananas. I had a side of bacon to complete breakfast and freshly brewed iced tea to wash it all down.

My favorite are the pumpkin pancakes! So thick and full of flavor, some of the best I've had. Also the home fries are made fresh not frozen. You can really tell the difference. And the food portions are huge!  If you go to Dor-Stop on the weekend it's really hard to get a seat without having to wait a while.  I would definitely recommend trying Dor-Stop..they are quite popular around here with the locals.",

Menu for breakfast very little to choose from if you are a traditionalist. Can't order sides so bring on a low carb diet I was charged. $13 for sausage two eggs and toast and bacon.  Everything tasted terrible.  Really.  And expensive.  I couldn't finish my coffee that's a first and I usually make myself instant!!!!!   Then check out my waitress at cashier is carrying on chat with another in the conversation.  Like.  And like.  And she was like... you get the idea. Then after my card went through the ultimate humiliation. She flips the cashier screen so it is now facing me for me to choose a tip amount the lowest being 18%!!!! I chose other and being embarrassed to leave no tip out $2.  STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!",

Seriously though, Dor-Stop was featured on Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.\" Don't quote me for certain on the hernia part, it was probably just a food-boner.   Anyways, The Dor-Stop Restaurant is a quaint, classic breakfast and lunch diner. Positive reviews cover the walls, and local businesses advertise on the restaurant's tables and placemats. It is clear how important the restaurant is to the community. While waits can be long, the surrounding streets and stores are very nice to walk through and pass the time.   Being a New Jersey (the diner state) native, I'm very critical of my diner experiences. To date, the chocolate chip banana hotcakes may be the best pancakes/hotcakes I've ever had. Not to mention the bacon is deliciously thick and crispy. This is one of the best breakfasts in Pittsburgh. The cheesesteak omelet is phenomenal as well.",

    "text": "We finally went to the Dor-Stop after being in the area for 10 years. I always seemed to hear good things about their breakfasts but never found the time to go because of their wait being out the door since it's so small. We finally got to go today. Walked in, put our name on the list and was told it would be about 20 minutes. We left to kill time, just around the block. We got back around 10 minutes later. I waked over to tell them that I was back and to get an estimate of how much longer it would take. They rudely responded, \"we called your name out multiple times. You'll have to wait.\" (Mind you, we were 10 minutes earlier than what they originally gave us at 20 minutes) - a few minutes later, a two top and a booth that fit 4 got up around the same time. Another booth right next to it was about to get up as well. They said, \"okay we can seat you.\" I nicely mentioned the booth that I brought up earlier and if we could still have one. They said, \"No, there's a customer of 3 that are getting that.\" I said, \"okay, there's another one about to be ready. We've been on the list for a while now and you're not busy anymore.\" They again said \"no, sorry. Booths are for three or more.\" So we got sat at a small table for two with waitresses, children, customers, etc all around the table, accidentally bumping into it and us. That second booth got sat a couple minutes later with only 2 people. Another booth later, same thing. I understand needing to nicely make that call if they were on an hour wait but there wasn't a wait at that point. Being a hostess when I was younger at a few restaurants, I would have never treated customers rude and unappreciated like they did. I will say that the food was decent but definitely not worth coming back because of the service and atmosphere. That's the only reason it's getting two stars at all.",

The half hour wait was very reasonable granted that the line to get a table was out the door and would stay this way for the next hour and a half that we were there.  It was easy to see why they are this popular;  The servers are quick and friendly and the food is reasonable and delicious!    This old style diner reminds me of Pamela's and instead of focusing on excellent Crepes the Dor-Stop has found their niche with pancakes and home fries!  The pancakes are wonderfully light and fluffy.  I tried some of the banana chocolate chip ones and they were incredible! For myself I ordered the All America which included a tasty burger, scrambled eggs, and home fries.  Would highly recommend the pancakes, but next time I'm here I would like to try an omelet or jumbot.    Be prepared to wait for a table here on weekends for brunch... but it's well worth the wait!  Don't be afraid to try the daily specials as I heard several people around me commenting on how excellent they were.  If you want to avoid going to the strip district for a wonderful brunch, this is the place to get it!  I wish the north hills of Pittsburgh had something as good as this around!",

The waiters were friendly and even though the place was packed, everything was delivered on time. There's isn't even one thing that I wasn't happy about in this place.

Parking is tough around here so my husband dropped me off so I could put our names in.  We were worried about the wait but only ended up waiting about 15 minutes and got 2 seats at the bar. We ordered the signature raspberry stuffed French toast and Guy's version of the Italian Jumbot.   The French toast was super yummy and the Jumbot was also tasty. However, though still good, the Jumbot was not as impressive as we had hoped for an signature dish. It was kind of an omelette with potatoes and a bunch of random ingredients. Also just to note, the French toast is not \"stuffed\" but rather the raspberry sauce is drizzled generously on top.   Our bill was under $20 so it was a quality meal for a very very low price. No complaints on our end, Dor-Stop is well worth a visit if you're ever in the Pittsburgh area!",

We had a very difficult time parking but managed to secure a spot on the street.

The place is small and very crowded. Food is all homemade from scratch. My girlfriend opted for breakfast so she settled for a veggie omelet with toast and I chose a turkey Rachel. The sandwich came on marble bread and was filled with sauerkraut an cheese. It also came with potato pancakes. Portion sizes were generous and the food was very good.  They are noted for their pancakes which we will try on another visit. We got our meals rather quickly and our waitress was very attentive to our needs. There is an $8.00 minimum charge for credit cards and there is a sign telling you that you must tell them when you order whether or not to split your check.  The tables are topped with various advertisers and they have interesting things to observe while you wait for your meal.  My suggestion would be to come during off hours or non-holiday especially if you want to have a nice breakfast or lunch. They are only open until 3 in the afternoon. We had a wonderful time!",

This place is exactly as it is on the show, really tasty breakfast foods all made from scratch. Great family atmosphere with friendly staff.  I had the apple cinnamon hotcakes and the cheese steak hoagie sandwich.   The hotcakes were just awesome. They came as a stack of three hotcakes with a lump of butter and a squeeze bottle of syrup.  The hoagie was just average, kind of small with lettuce tomato, green pepper seasoned with salad dressing and mayo. Kind of weird.  Coffee wasn't very tasty either, or rather seemed to be on the mild side.  Note their hours are 6a - 3p. Metered street parking and a metered public lot down the block.",

Even though the place was packed we were luckily seated right away and presented with menu eery person wants to see on a Saturday morning. we all ordered what we wanted and didn't have to wait too long! Best part is, everything is made from scratch and you can def tell.   We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves at a decent price and we will for sure be back.",

The environment of the place is perfect: friendly, happy, and serving great food.  I even found the coffee here delicious.    I got the special for the day, which was the Irish Jumbot.  My grandma explained to me this morning that jumbot, when referring to food, mean just a plate full of different kinds of things.  That is exactly what it was.  The reason this was an \"Irish\" jumbot was because it had corned beef in it.  Oh my it was delicious.  In the past my mother has ordered the flavored french toast with the blueberries.  I still remember it being one of the most different and delicious breakfast plates I have ever had.    I will defiantly be back to the Dor-Stop soon.  It is honestly one of the best breakfast places I have been to in the area.",

Walking in, it looks like your typical hole-in-the-wall diner, very small with not a ton of seating which is ok because they get people in and out fast. We put our name in and waited about 15 minutes then seated at our table. My mom ordered a egg white omelette, my brother ordered a sausage an cheese omelette, I ordered one banana chocolate chip pancake and a Western omelette, and my dad ordered some pancakes and eggs with some sausage.   The pancakes were amazing. Very delicious, fluffy and large. . Everyone else was satisfied with their meal. If I were to get here again I would order just pancakes or some of their french toast. My omelette was good but nothing amazing. If you want good pancakes and french toast then I would go to Dor-Stop their eggs and other menu items weren't terrible by any means just nothing to write home about.",

I wanted the egg burrito, but I felt like I should try the pancakes too! So I got the burrito, and the pancakes to share with my husband. The burrito was fantastic! The pancakes were so thick and had a cakey consistency. They were very filling. This place has been on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, my husband got the same dish that Guy had and he liked it very much. We left stuffed and happy, and for a very good price. If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, I will definitely go back!",

My girlfriend and I have been looking for a new breakfast spot for a while and the Dor-Stop has always been high on my list to try.  The place is classic, still has a bar counter, kitschy items adorn the walls and the a feeling that you are dining in your grandmother's restaurant. The place is always packed but we were quickly seated and like many have stated before my coffee cup never fell below 3/4 full before it was refilled.  Now lets get to the nitty gritty: the food.  I got the pancake breakfast, usually a very simple and easy breakfast but when the breakfast came I was so impressed. The hotcakes are so different, some would even say magical. They are so fluffy and moist and complimented their super crispy bacon. I almost wanted to fold the entire breakfast up and eat a giant pancake eggarito. My mouth is watering thinking about it.  My girlfriend got the breakfast sandwich which was very well done. Their ham is so succulent and tender. They cut it off the bone at the Dor-Stop and is shows. The sandwich is a work of art and is the classiest breakfast sandwich I have ever seen.   I recommend this place to anyone and will definitely come back to try some other types of pancakes. They are the best in the city.  Oh and try the potato pancakes, they will rock your world.",

Hotcakes thick and soft as fresh cookies, something called \"jumbot\" (which seems to be Pittsburghese for \"whatever we scraped off the grill\", but boy is it good), and good luck finding the bottom of a cup of coffee, because they'll never let you get low enough to see it.  Maybe these aren't the hugest pancakes in town (that honor goes to the MANcakes at Eggs-R-Us in Crafton), but they sure are delicious. Well worth a few minutes' wait for a table.",

    "text": "This is the second review of The Dor- Stop, I gave it another star this time.  Canadian Friend of Joe (CFoJ) was getting ready to catch the 4:45 flight to Philly, and wanted to share one more meal before leaving the Burgh. He was hungry for breakfast, after all it was only noon and he was still in bed. So he calls me and says meet in Dormont for some serious diner food.  He's already at a table when I walk in, sitting there eating a huge cinnamon roll, split in half, grilled and looking soooo delicious. So he points to the wall and says \"Guy from Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives was here\". Spitting pieces of Cinnamon roll at me in his excitement, who knew Canada got the food network?  I ordered the oatmeal pancakes, knowing full well there are eggs in the batter (somethings are just worth having as a vegan) but at least I was smart enough to have the butter on the side so I could discard it later.  He ordered the raspberry french toast, over hard eggs (Canadian for broken yokes) and bacon, a large OJ, coffee, and the cinnamon bun he was noshing when i entered. The man can eat, and he's so thin, I really hate him and his metabolism.  My oatmeal cakes were HUGE, and three to an order, I got the first one down without any problem, they were moist, chewy, flavorful with real oatmeal and cinnamon, and the syrup was almost not needed as they have a natural sweetness to them.  He devoured his french toast, eggs, bacon, saying it was one of the best breakfasts places he's ever been to.  It's a shame we take restaurants for granted, here's a guy from Vancouver, over 3000 miles away wishing the Dor-Stop was in his home town.",

    "text": "Been reading about this place on the Internet and was really looking forward to it. Went for breakfast on a Monday morning, and this is clearly the place to go to in the area plus it only got busier as the day went on. Opens at 6, but went at 8:30 and still plenty of seats. No guarantees on later around lunch time though haha. Definitely more of a diner feel as opposed to a restaurant, especially with the open kitchen and smaller seating area.   Down to it: I ended up getting the Meat Lover's Omelette with Grits and Rye toast on the side. Toast you can't really go wrong with but they definitely butter it up less than some of your other counterpart breakfast places. The grits were misleading at first (confused them with the apple sauce for some reason) but definitely nice with some salt and pepper (butter too if you must). The omelette was great though. Good amount of meat inside and the eggs were cooked enough yet not dry or oily at all.   Additionally ordered the Bob's potato pancakes which are essentially flattened hash browns. Not bad at all but had an unusual sweetness to them which was confusing with their oily nature.   Service was better than average, our waitress was nice and conversed with us at length; she kept us in the loop with what was happening with our food which is always a plus.  My main concern is the pancakes. They do theirs thicker than some places and as such there's the risk that the batter won't be fully cooked. They informed us that they were cooking it a bit longer because it wasn't fully cooked but even after it was brought out there were some unevenly cooked parts. Still delicious though.  All in all hope I can come back and try other things! They have burgers and other more lunch ish items that looked appetizing!",

But we went today (Friday) around 9am and was able to be seated right away.  The pancakes are what they are known for, so my arm was twisted and I had to try them.  I ordered up the Chocolate Chip Banana Pancakes with some bacon.  My early morning date went with Vicki's Italian Jumbot.  Both breakfast dishes were awesome.  The pancakes were light, fluffy and moist.  Ample amounts of bananas and chocolate chips.  I opted to forego the syrup and eat these up as is.  I was not disappointed.  It is like eating dessert for breakfast.   My date had the Italian Jumbot.  I have no idea what was going on with this dish, but wow it worked.  I stuck my fork into her dish numerous times to try it despite the 'angry scowls'.  There is a lot of potatoes, ham, eggs, onions, peppers, cheese and tomatoes in this hodgepodge.    The service was friendly, fast and efficient.  They were always coming around offering up more coffee which I gladly accepted.    The prices are well within reason.  They are equivalent to other diners but the food is WAY better than your standard diner.    Hit this place up anytime you can...I wish I still lived in Mt. Lebanon so that I could roll into here each and every weekend.",

Little knickknacks everywhere and the signs are hilarious! The staff constantly bussed tables at an impressive speed. We sat at the window seat, awesome for people watching!   Food was excellent! Certainly one of the best brunches I've ever had. I ordered a veggie omelette and my boyfriend got an Italian jumbot. My omelette was packed with delicious veggies and his jumbot had these perfect crispy little homefries.   Dor-Stop only gets 4 versus 5 stars due to lackluster service. Our waitress did her job properly. However, we did not get her name, no smile, no friendliness that you would expect at such a cozy establishment.   I left feeling empty in my heart, but not my stomach!",

I understand that they were busy, but 2 people after us got seated and served before we did. We finally got served and the waitress wasn't all that nice. No apology for not being waited on for 10 minutes. Needless to say....their food was amazing. I had guys version of the jumbot and I can't stop thinking about it. If I had a little better service then would totally be a 5 star, but service is something that makes people come back. Hopefully it was just a. Very busy and off day for them, because everything else was awesome!",

My vegetarian Jumbot came out with the cheese looking decidedly congealed (it was, I watched the dish sit under the warming station for 10 minutes.)  Spicy? Not particularly.  The pumpkin pancakes had good flavor, but were doughy and undercooked.  Service can make up for a multitude of food sins. Unfortunately, here it didn't.  The service, at least on my visit, was obviously from the culture of \"No.\"  Me: Hi, can you serve the Jumbot as a burrito? (Same basic ingredients as the burrito).  Server:  No.  Me:  Ok, how about a side of pierogies?  Server:  No. That's only for the special.  Service efficiency was also lacking.  25 minutes to get an order of pancakes?  Good bye Dor-Stop. I won't be returning.",

I ordered my favorite item, the oatmeal pancakes, which are nutty, fluffy and have a hint of sweetness. Like other reviewers, I just love those pancakes so much I can't seem to order anything else! The bottomless and pretty good drip coffee is a perfect touch that fits in the diner ambiance.   Others in the group ordered the veggie omelet, banana chocolate chip pancakes, eggs Benedict, the German potato pancakes, and a variety of other pancakes. The potato pancakes are delicious, with a hint of sweetness, touch of salt, and the requisite apple sauce/sour cream as an accent. I \"helped\" a friend eat these- they were very, very tasty. Good as those were, the regular pancakes are still the star of the meal. Everyone left full and satisfied, even on a very busy Friday at lunch. Challenging parking was a common gripe- make sure you bring change for the meters or else plan to walk quite a few blocks.  I'll be back, and you can bet I'm ordering the pancakes again!",

Everyone at my table really enjoyed their food from their omelets, to their fancy flavored homemade pancakes etc... I liked it so much that I went back a few days later with my Mom and Sister. They both really enjoyed their food as well! I would highly recommend this place for breakfast or brunch (as that was all I tried.) I will certainly come back any time I am visiting Pittsburgh.

If it wasn't for these scrumptious staples of breakfast I would never know why it was worth waiting 30 minutes for a table. I ordered the pumpkin pancakes. These this are filling! I could only eat 1 1/2 before being stuffed like the Thanksgiving turkey. Mmmm stuff a turkey with pumpkin pancake .............. anyway. I usually need syrup to add flavor to this sweet treat, but I didn't need any here! I also tried Darren's chocolate chip pancakes. The had so many semisweet chips in them I thought they were stuffed pancakes at first! Soooooo good but even one round cake would make me feel a bit sick from sugar overload. The staff seems able to keep up with the tidal wave of a crowd and get everyone in and out rather quickly. I like that! If you're looking for a place to relax and take your time, this ain't it. if you want some quality pancakes or French toast (poor man's egg sandwich as the Britts call it) and a show watching the cooks do their thang, come here and and be amazed!",

You get three pancakes and I had to take two home to finish later. My friend got the stuffed French toast with bacon and again, delicious.  The food came fast but the waitress wasn't all that attentive. She was pleasant enough but we received no coffee or water refills. That's pretty much the only complaint. If you're in the area, definitely stop and check this out.",

The staff is quick, friendly and very \"with it.\" This is a True family business and the food is fantastic. I love the jumbot! It's amazing and hearty. The coffee isn't the best, but the food makes up for it. The french toast and pancakes are lovely too. This is not the place to go if you are dieting as they are GENEROUS with the butter. I like this place way better than Pamelas, which, apart from the strawberry crepes, doesn't really do it for me. It was recently on the Food Network too so I'm not the only one that feels that way!",

I recommed the Bob's Breakfast and the Raspberry stuffed French Toast.  Their bacon is always done perfectly. They are a family run business, and if you go two times or more, they will remember you, and sometimes even your name..!  They have moved locations recently- (just across the street) to accommodate more customers, and they have become non-smoking!  Yeay!",

Granted that I later discovered the sign on the door that indicates no outside food or drinks; however, it's also the smallest sign on the door. Furthermore, I didn't appreciate the fact that this was brought up to us after we were seated. They clearly saw us come in with the coffee in hand, as we had to wait to be seated.  In my opinion, this could have been handled better. Most places would remind you of their policy and ask that you note it for the future. Instead, we were railroaded to pay for two outside coffees. Accordingly, we changed our order to go because of this.  With that said, I'm still giving this establishment four stars because I truly enjoyed the food. I just wish that they had better customer service, as I most likely will not return due to that distasteful encounter.",

We went around 10:30 on Sunday and had to wait about 45 minutes for a table for four to open. The atmosphere is exactly what you would want and expect from a diner, right down to the greasy food and cramped dining area. My in laws got oatmeal walnut pancakes, which they liked, and a side of home fries. They have been here before and that's what they always get. Why mess with what works?   I ordered the farmers omelet, which to be honest didn't really have much flavor. There are so many ingredients in it that I couldn't single anything out. The bright side is that they were quick with the coffee refills, and more importantly they poached my wife's eggs perfectly. Which isn't easy to do.   The meal was pretty cheap for four people, and the atmosphere was cool, so we will probably give it another shot. I would just stick to a more simple omelet.",

Although I did this immediately, and apologized sincerely, this really ticked Laura off, though she said it was okay. I also asked for a box (saving her an extra trip), since I only eat 1 pancake.  The big pancakes arrived so piping hot, I had to let them cool almost 5 minutes. No box, though. They tasted very good, pretty balanced flavors. They were \"heavy\",  hearty, I guess.  Laura insisted I try it without syrup first. Okay. It was so tasty, I ate almost the whole pancake before using syrup. I took the other two home, but had to ask for a box. Again.  The coffee was typical diner coffee. I hunted Laura down, previously just standing at the counter, who was wiping the last table in the back, asking for a refill. Two minutes later, she brought coffee, took my plate and all my silverware. She didn't bring more cream (I was out). I didn't see her on the floor (hardly at all during my visit), and told the two servers chatting behind the counter, that I didn't have cream, or a spoon, and needed to go, so I didn't even drink my second cup. They became huffy, and said I should've asked for more cream and a spoon (I was in the ladies room). They didn't offer me a cup to go, either. So, I left, but with a slightly bad taste, because of the service.",

No reservations allowed, but we called ahead to make sure they could accommodate us (i.e.  how long a wait?) and were seated within just a few minutes.  Our server was happy to serve a group, service was quick.  Kids welcome, there's a kid's menu.   No one rushed us out, but we noticed several folks waiting as we were wrapping up so we didn't linger at our table.  (Yelpers are nice that way!)  Parking is street only, at a meter, but no trouble finding a spot.  The food was great:  Raspberry French toast with a whipped cream raspberry topping, pancakes, cinnamon rolls and eggs of all kinds. Basically something to satisfy everyone. It's a well-reviewed restaurant, as their website attests, including being featured on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  It's a bright, clean spot located in the metro area of Pittsburgh called Dormont, hence the name:  Dor-Stop (I'm guessing) as opposed to Door Stop (which makes no sense). A visit to this truly local diner has the added bonus of taking you to a nice little area of town with a distinctly different vibe.",

There are so many other things on the menu that I would love to try as well such as the banana chocolate chip pancakes, the breakfast burrito, ect.  I would certainly go back to this place and hope that I do the next time I am in the Pittsburgh area.  So so good.",

    "text": "The Dor-Stop is a great small breakfast restaurant.  Once you enter the doors of pancake heaven you are greeted with friendly staff and the delicious smells of pancakes and meat on the griddle and other various breakfast aromas.  We came Sunday for breakfast and, boy does this place fill up!    The Dor-Stop has gained fame from Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, but that's not what I care about! I just want the food!  So, that's what I did, I ordered the food after ordering my coffee.  Their menu has all of the classics including their signature pancakes, omelets, french toast and eggs cooked to suit.  My coffee cup and water were kept full and while sipping on my caffeinated beverage, my meal came.  The Dor-Stop produced my order of two eggs over medium, and two large banana, chocolate chip pancakes.  I was speechless once I took a bite of that cakey, breakfast goodness (the pancakes not the eggs!).  The pancakes are really delicious. They have the perfect texture, the perfect taste, the perfect look, the perfect smell... need I go on?  The eggs were good too, I don't want to leave them out, but what egg is going to win again the battle of pancakes v eggs?  Breakfast Breakdown,  The Food: Delicious! The Value: I believe my two egg combo was $7.99. Breakfast for four with coffee was close to $40. That's not too bad. The Experience:  It's a small restaurant full of happy people! I happened to glance at the table next to us  and saw the breakfast burrito.  It's massive! Would I return?: Why, yes. I wish I lived closer so I could eat them every Sunday. 5 stars?: I've been to a restaurant that claimed to have the best pancakes in the world.  They were wrong. The Dor-Stop has the best pancakes and for not claiming to have the best, they get 5 stars, because these pancakes were heaven sent!  Bonus game!: How many times were pancakes and breakfast mentioned in this review? Points to the winner!",

Setting of the restaurant is more like a diner than it is a restaurant, but that does nothing to detract from what it's best at serving: good old-fashioned breakfast food. The pancakes here are quite fantastic ... my favorite kind being the banana chocolate chip pancakes. Yeah, it's probably not light on calories, but to be honest, that's not really a thought if you opt to go for these. The chocolate chips are warm and well-melted into the actual pancake itself, making for one delicious yummy bite after the next. Their hot cakes are also a nice choice along with the stuffed raspberry French toast, which was oh so good. The raspberry sauce was actually not as tangy as I anticipated ... which is a good thing, considering that it would have been a sore spot (too sour) if it contrasted too much with the sweet consistency of the dish. In general this is a great breakfast spot to hit up ... oh and also a decent joint for sandwiches, my favorite being the Russian Reuben with the tender beef, great sauerkraut, along with the cheese & thousand island dressing combo that make for a delicious combination.",

It was a Sunday after church and the line was wrapped around the block; as a diner enthusiast this was a fantastic sign.   A few days later I brought a friend there for lunch the feta burger I had was amazing. The next time I went ,with my sister and nephew,  I got the burger again and an order of their famous pancakes. The flavor options were long, but I choose banana walnut. These where hands down the best pancakes I have ever consumed.   The atmosphere is wholesome. The waitstaff is not friendly but accommodating. Honestly they don't have time to be overly friendly they are too busy. However they do a fine job serving you.   All in all this place is an A-. The only downside for me was not having The cast from cheers welcome me by name. But the food is remarkable.",

The service is good -- the servers are attentive and professional, but there's a mom-and-pop feel about it too. I travel from an hour away to visit about once a month or so. It's that worth it. Reasonably priced.  The only drawback is they don't have real maple syrup. (Only Cracker Barrel seems to in the US, but that's just the Canadian in me.)

Finally had the opportunity when I visited by brother for his graduation at Carnegie Mellon. The wait time is killer, so be sure to bring something to entertain yourself for the time being. I think we waited for half an hour, but we weren't terribly hungry, so it was fine. Finally sat down and looked at the menu deciding what to order. Both the pumpkin pancakes and raspberry french toast looked so good, but I didn't want to be a pig and eat both of them (well, I could if I wanted to). My mother suggested that we can order both items and split it from there. Brilliant! Get to taste the both worlds. :)  Pumpkin pancakes were delish! A bit on the dense side, yet still fluffy. Spices were so fragrant, like it was Thanksgiving! Not terribly sweet, but at the perfect amount where you don't need the syrup. Huge servings; your serotonin levels will rise. :) The raspberry stuffed french toast would probably have to be my favorite. The crusty/crunchy exterior of the french toast slices stole the stage. The whole dish was sweet enough that syrup was also not necessary.  Their peach cobbler french toast special looked tempting, but sadly they ran out right when we were seated. Sad. :(",

I ordered the \"Ham on the Bone\" breakfast which gives you three long strips of fresh ham, two eggs, well done breakfast potatoes, and some toasted Italian bread with butter.  The entire breakfast tasted farm fresh. The breakfast potatoes had a crispy outer skin that brought the whole plate together.   What's wrong with it? Well, not much. I ordered my eggs over easy and they came a bit undercooked. Easily forgivable for a meal that filled me up until way passed lunch.  If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, you know I'll be back, jack!",

    "text": "I have been here before, and it's just as I remembered it.  Came here with my husband, heavily pregnant and wanting pancakes.  To be clear,  I dislike pancakes.  My memories of them are the shake-in-the-container bisquik crap my mother used to make.  Hate pancakes.  But, wanted good ones, and was in the area.  Early weekday morning, so parking wasn't terrible, but still not easy.  Dormont is a cramped, busy area with an abundance of metered parking.  We were immediately seated, and asked by 3 different servers for our drink orders.  Hot coffee was immediately given, and never reached less than half of a cup, even after I said I was done. I ordered the apple cinnamon pancakes and my husband ordered a steak and cheese omelet with homefries.  This place boasts its appearance on \"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives\", and there are articles sprinkling the diner.  It is usually always busy, and feels like a traditional diner: small space, bustling, and noisy.  There are a lot of locals, but we were not treated any less for not being familiar faces (we are from Pittsburgh, just not Dormont).  Food arrived hot, and my pancakes were coated with powdered sugar.  I avoid the syrup, as having lived in New England for a number of years, I will only use maple syrup on...anything.  I avoided the corn syrupy topping offered on the table, and am not sure if they offer maple syrup as a substitute (should never be a \"substitute\"!).  The cakes are great by themselves, and taste nothing like the buttermilk terrors of my childhood.  These are airy, cakey, and some would say, overly sweet--even without the powdered sugar.  The cinammon was lost in the breakfast, and the apples were, to the best of my knowledge, not canned. I could only eat about 1.5-2 of the 3 beasts, and snacked on my husband's homefries.  As others have commented, the homefries are not uniform diced or shredded potatoes.  They are soft, with the right amount of brown from the griddle, and slightly under-salted.  They are real potatoes that likely don't come from a freezer.  Wish there was a meal where I could maximize my carbs (pancakes, homefries, bacon--you get it).  All-in-all, this place is unique in that it can offer pancakes that I will eat, and is a well-known spot for a lot of Pittsburgh residents, certainly those in the South Hill.  Television appearance aside, it's still worth a try, but I recommend a weekday morning.",

I loved that it was something very original as compared to a standard breakfast item you can get anywhere.   It was three good sized pieces of banana bread, with a good thickness to them, and definitely filled me up. The only thing that I would say is missing was a little more peanut butter taste, as I didn't get much of one. Other than that it was great. The side of bacon that came with it was also a good portion size.  The overall price of $32 for three people was fairly priced and they had a bunch of other things on the menu that I would have wanted to try as well. I'll definitely be back",

The turkey sandwich I had was a solid choice and was fixed in Pittsburgh style with fries and cole slaw in it. The interesting part was the potato pancakes that came with the sandwich. I liked the way they were prepared, and they had some seasoning that gave them a nice taste. It's good to have something a little different than fries or chips with a sandwich.

The owner and her daughter are crazy endearing.  The focus here, of course, is on the pancakes.  This is the only place I know of that serves pumpkin pancakes year round, and it is for a reason.  These are dense and sweet, enough that even I don't syrup them.  A little whipped butter in a paper souffle cup and a dash of salt (hey, don't knock it 'til you try it), I can clear three or so in a few minutes.  They also have staple breakfast items, along with the jumbot. At least one of the guys in my party always goes for the ham on the bone/jumbot.  If you can fit this thing in your body, go for it.  The only other unique item to try would be the stuffed french toast.  Personally, between syrupy fruit filling (compote is too kind a word for this ice cream topping inside) and then topped with more fruit syrup, it tastes more like a heavy dessert for me, but I know those who swear by this as their weekend treat.  If you find yourself on the other side of the Liberty Tubes on an early morning, you need to go get pumpkin pancakes.  You can even call ahead for it to be ready for take out and avoid the mess of hungry Dormont-ers along the Potomac sidewalk, but then you'd miss making new friends with your slightly brash waitress and the infamous specials on the tiny chalkboard.  Either way, depending on your timing, this diner will hit the very top on your breakfast list.",

    "text": "Another 5-star find in the Pittsburgh area. I kid you not. Guy Fieri hyped the right place.  It is hands down the best diner in the universe.  Actually, I don't know that for sure, but I dare you to find a better diner anywhere in the United States.  The food here is made with love and that's what makes it stand out out. You can taste the love in every single bite.  The staff of this family-owned restaurant run like a well-oiled machine, used to the crazy crowds that come here every day to blow their diets and binge.  This was all a girl could ask for on a cheat day.  I had Vicki's Italian Jumbot but with Guy Fieri's twist on it, making it a little more spicy. It was more than enough for Jim and I to share.  We also shared the fantastic pumpkin pancakes. They do not need syrup at all. So fluffy, so delicious and gut-busting.  Why do I have to live in D.C?  I would be here every weekend for brunch.  There is nothing like this place over here..wahhh!   This place is great for sharing so order different dishes and eat them family style. The portions are gigantic and unforgiving!   Anyway, do not come to Dor-Stop thinking they have become over-commercialized because  of their appearance on the Food Network. They have not. They are the same family-owned established where you can get no nonsense  service and absolutely amazing food.  If you are in Pittsburgh, run don't walk to Dormont and grab a seat at Dor-Stop.  This is a glutton's dream come True.",

Today I went on a Friday morning  Was lovely and got a booth to myself.  Both time the food and service were 5 stars.  Really good breakfast staples.  I had eggs, bacon and home fries today.  Also a side order of potato pancakes, because why stop with just one starchy dish?    These pancakes are not your bubby's potato pancakes, though they do come with apple sauce or sour cream (or both if you ask nicely). These are, I guess, German style.  They have some chopped up vegetable (broccoli?).  They also have the dreaded (for me) ingredient of garlic.  I cannot eat garlic.  It makes me feel illllllllllllllllllll.  Plus i taste it for daaaaaaaaays.  So, one bite in I realized I had ordered something I couldn't eat.  But I couldn't send it back -- it was perfectly prepared, fresh, etc.  So I decided to say nothing.    But the waitress walked by and noticed I wasn't eating the potato pancakes and asked me what was wrong.  When I explained the garlic thing, she immediately offered to take them off the bill.  Without my asking.  Instead I welcomed a second order of bacon (moo moo, that's me).  Next time I will remember to try the ham from the bone because that looked terrific!",

Dor-Stop, is now added to that list, as I REALLY enjoyed my breakfast there, even though we never really went there as kids. Street parking was readily available. Very friendly staff greeted us upon walking in and sat us at a clean table right away. I'm sure had this been a weekend we would have been waiting. The coffee bar up front is a nice option for diners/caffeine seekers on the go. The food is to die for. I had French toast with bacon and potato pancakes, all of which were top notch. The potato pancakes were better than any diner in NJ I've been to, and that's saying alot. The French toast was dipped in cinnamon sugar before cooking which gave it an extra sweet crisp crunch. My wife really enjoyed the scrambled eggs and home fries. My coffee was never empty, and for under 30 bucks we had one of the best meals of our trip so far. Highly recommended",

It's not very large and it's *very* popular (we arrived at 9:00 a.m. [on a Sunday] and it was already very crowded, which we normally wouldn't want to bother with.  However; we knew about that situation in advance, and actually we didn't have to wait too terribly long for a table).  I ordered a vegetarian (three-egg) omelette with egg whites, which came with toast & hash browns - and my husband ordered a vegetarian burrito.  We both ordered coffee, too.  The food was *delicious* & portions were quite sufficient, and the coffee was pretty good (a little too weak, but better than at most diners [and also more expensive, at $1.89]).  Our server was *terrific*; she had a great sense of humor (we had a very amusing conversation with her) and she was also very attentive.  The people at the cash register (who also took names for tables) were friendly, too.  Afterwards, I complimented the wife half of the owner couple (who have owned the Dor-Stop for 26 years) and also their daughter & the (three) cooks.  All of them were very friendly and the cooks had a great sense of humor.  Our (two) meals cost $22.17 with tax (but before the tip).  The restroom was clean, too.",

Not sure if that was a bad choice or not, since we got waited on right away. Once our food arrived no one came back to wait on us, we both needed refills on our water/coffee and placed them on the edge of the bar to make the process easier. There we multiple people around us to assist in this but no one made direct eye contact and we didn't want to waive them down, as this is their job and how they get tips. We decided we were done eating and they immediately took our plates, once that happened a lady who seemed like a manager came over and asked us if we wanted more coffee, but at that point we were so disappointed that we were ready to leave. We never even received our check or saw our waitress. We had to go pay without a check and tell them what we had ordered. We'll probably go back since it is close and the food was great, just hoping the service improves.",

There are several bar stools at the counter as well as booths and tables. Pancakes in various styles are all homemade.  Banana Walnut, Pumpkin and more.  Large portions and delicious.  Four slices of Raspberry french toast with a crisp crunch topping and not too sweet raspberry cream. The eggs Benedict has a unique Pittsburgh spin.  Instead of an English Muffin, the poached eggs sit atop a nice slice of Italian bread.  In place of Canadian Baco,n you have carved ham from the bone.  Really delicious!  The potato pancakes are crisp and oniony. Potatoes with peppers, hot or not are well done.  Everything comes as a generous portion.

The home fries are great - big chunks, browned and crunchy on one side, but soft on the other, with a good mix of each.   My sausage patties were great, as was my Italian bread toast. Yes, they even have grits!  Thank you.   Eggs may be eggs, but my scrambled ones were on the fluffy side and were served very hot. I asked to have cheddar added, which I highly recommend.   For dessert (yes, breakfast can have a dessert), I split the cinnamon roll with my lovely wife. It's great, too - soft and warm and homemade, with a raspberry drizzle.

My boyfriend order Guy's Jumbot and I had the spicy omelette no cheese with grits and wheat toast. The food came out hot and ready for us to eat. My boyfriend loved his meal and said it was just enough food for him (he has a heart appetite). My omelette was a decent size but didn't have many jalapenos in it so that was disappointing. Overall, the meal was good but the service was not super great. The restaurant was pretty empty and we didn't order too much. We just needed water and we didn't get a refill which was frustrating. Not a huge deal but worth mentioning . We will most likely return !",

It was a nice change of pace.  Came here Sunday morning and were seated quickly and service was great. I'd recommend if you're in the area, but nothing extraordinary on the menu. They do have a lot of different flavors of hot cakes and French toast though.",

Unfortunately, it seems the talent that got them the attention of the show is no longer apparent.    It feels like they have rested on the Guy Fieri laurels for quite a while.   The food is lackluster and bland.  Service is brusque but efficient.  I had the burrito.  It showed up luke warm with congealed cheese and what I can only assume to be canned salsa on top.  We also ordered the Texas french toast.  Which turns out to be wonder bread lightly soaked in egg and grilled with a little sugar.    All in all it was just bland.",

    "text": "This place is pretty awesome for breakfast.  It was featured on an episode of Diners, Drive In's, and Dives with Guy Fiery.  Located on the the outskirts of Pittsburgh, no major issues with traffic in this area.  The restaurant setting as a whole is nothing really special, typical diner setup, tables pretty tight, and a few spots to sit at bar seating up by the cash register.  Service is about average, expect to wait a little bit due to the restaurants popularity.  We waited about 25-30 minutes for a table, but considering we got there 10:00am on the Sunday following St Patrick's Day, felt this was not bad.  It did seem to get a lot busier around 10:30-11:00 though.  The food was really great.  My daughter got the chocolate chip pancakes.  If you are into light and fluffy, these might not be up your alley, they are extremely dense, and I thought that they were crazy good.  Whatever my daughter couldn't eat, I was glad to finish for her, just really different and really good!  I had a the Spicy Omelette which had pepper jack cheese, onions, peppers and sausage and was really delicious.  Home fries were also good.  Also got a side order of the potato pancakes, and weren't bad.  My son had the raspberry French toast which are served with a raspberry cream cheese and raspberry drizzle and very good as well.  This seemed to be one of there more popular specialties.  My wife and one of the daily specials which was an Irish Hash, which she also liked.  Overall very good, and next time we are in the Pittsburgh area will make it a point to come back!",

We ordered a variety of items from hot cakes to french toast to omelettes.  The hot cakes are sooo fluffay! Each plate comes with 3 very good sized pancakes. Mom tried the banana coconut and I tries the oatmeal apple cinnamon. Mine were a tad on the sweet side, but mom's were just excellent! I really liked the addition of fresh fruits. You could see the apples and bananas cooked right in.  Dad had the french toast. It's 3 texas toasts cut in half. Pretty good, but also fairly standard fare. Lastly, Brother opted for the south of the border omelette. He said it was really good, but that the home fries weren't crispy enough.   It was definitely more than enough food to hold us over until almost dinner time...but then again, we aren't really accustomed to eating plates this big in my hometown!",

Score!  Even though they were out of this world busy, the staff was friendly and chatted us up when they would pour some more coffee for us.   I thought I wanted breakfast (I mean, I did, but the menu has so many good choices!) but I went with the Rachel Reuben. It was great! Also served with two of the best potato pancakes I've ever had. Applesauce AND sour cream, please. :)  The hub had a philly cheese steak (and half of my Rachel) with fries. There were no leftovers to be had.  All in all we are glad we stopped in and will definitely be back!",

The potato pancakes were unremarkable: small, soggy, on the sweet side. The ham we ordered with them though was delicious. The oatmeal pancakes were perfect though and you get three huge, thick pancakes! I loved the hearty texture and I could even skip the syrup. My kids got French toast and feta burger raved about both. I wish the server had pointed out the specials menu though because our neighboring table ordered that and it looked amazing.",

The Dor-Stop has been featured on DDD, and so, we needed to eat here.  Like many places in the Pittsburgh area, I've been lost in this neighborhood before, but never noticed this cute little place. NOTE: it's small, it's crowded, come with only your best friends, be prepared to make friends while you wait for a table to open up. If you're lucky, the front counter folks will bring out pancake samples while you're waiting - they're a cross between Deluca's and Pamela's - kind of crispy on the outside but fluffy on the inside? I dunno.  ANYWAY. Service, efficient and friendly. Menu - all the good stuff, with potato pancakes and other little bits, along with the DDD featured items. I got the Guy's Way, which was a nice mix of savory breakfasty things. Tasty without the need for hot sauce.  We were in and out pretty quick, but didn't feel rushed. Classic diner - will be back if'n I'm over this way again.",

My friends mentioned that this place was pretty popular and had been featured on Guy Fieri's \"Diners, Drive-Ins, & Dives\" so there's typically a wait, but it's worth waiting. Upon walking in, the dining room is pretty small, which meant we had to wait outside. The decor looks like it was mostly untouched from the mid-80's, but that's the charm of an old school diner. The few recent additions to the decor include pictures and articles related to Guy Fieri's visit, it's pretty heavily publicized throughout the restaurant, including at least one dish on the menu featuring Guy's name in the title.  Diners are never the most attractive places, they succeed on their low prices, quick service and delicious food. The Dor-Stop Restaurant nailed all three of those factors perfectly. My breakfast was simple, I ordered a vegetable egg white omelette with home fries, wheat toast, and a side of spicy italian sausage. The food was delicious, though I received a regular omelette instead of an egg white omelette, but that's not the end of the world. I also got to taste the chocolate chip pancakes (they call them hotcakes) and some kind of strawberry french toast, both were absolutely amazing, definitely some of the best versions of those items that I've ever had.",

I went a week or so ago for the first time and will give it a second try and can hopefully give a high rating.  I read the rave review of the pancakes, and this guy LOVES pancakes. On the fence between oatmeal and pumpkin, I opted for pumpkin. The fact that I was able to get this in March made me a happy guy.  To my dismay, I should've picked up some powdered donuts and buttered them up. It would've been more moist. They tasted like sugar. I didn't get any cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin flavor I was so desperately hoping for. Just super sweetness. They were very dry as well. I love a nice moist pancake and was bummed it didn't happen.  Another lesson, don't order grits north of the Mason Dixon line. I keep forgetting everybody does instant or minute maid grits without seasoning or butter. My bad on that. I have to try the oatmeal pancakes and give this joint redemption. Service was very good and ambiance was perfect, hence 3 stars.",

The restaurant itself is pretty small but cozy. We had a party of 6 and they sat us right away. (It was around 1pm on a Saturday.) I ordered the vegetarian omelette and home fries and I can say it was one of the best omelettes I've had! Huge portions and everything tasted great! Fiance opted for the meatloaf sandwich and he said it was also delicious. Father-in-law got their signature stuffed french toast which came with a generous serving of bacon and toast.  Loved the hometown feel of the place and it was a nice stop before we headed to the movie. You defiantly won't leave hungry here!",

Bizarre, gaudy, and obscenely edible, a hamburger patty is placed atop some biscuits, anointed with cheddar that is melted into a crisp dome of sorts, doused with chili, and garnished with diced onions in the raw. The heavy biscuits took in the red, meaty, yet mild juices of the chuck-n-bean laden chili, which was complimented by the hardened cheddar and fresh, sweet onions. Savory, crunchy, doughy, beefy chords were all struck by a meal that if it were a song, would have been recorded by Slayer...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpwllpSP97G8&s=2ee6e65506e56281bfea085a6a42a2f4714cd64118b97a9c25ecee7a2c491fdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=pwll...</a>  And if darkness hadn't been already enthroned triumphant, for dessert I had a fiendishly fudgy wedge of a chocolate cake so debauchedly bulky, it would make angels choke...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DFMsPat2hmrA&s=86a3c9a6d723d51ac7eef48d47450a5fb24de5be7b1609253cdd2cd9cc18de1d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=FMsP...</a>  Only a glass of milk blessed by a cleric could wash it down.

I ordered Guy's version of the breakfast jumbot, as I was in the mood for something on the spicy side. My waitress confirmed the order verbally. I received the regular jumbot instead, but didn't say anything because I was on a tight schedule with a plane to catch.  I was disappointed with the lack of flavor/seasoning in my meal. It consisted of scrambled eggs, ham, bell peppers, and some type of cheese (tasted artificial and powder-based). The eggs were wetter than I prefer when I order them scrambled. Maybe they added water? Several pieces of ham I ate were very gristly and inedible. I ate less than half of the meal and left. I wouldn't go back.",

Our wait time was 20 minutes, so we decided to take a walk as it was nice outside. The diner was a nice place with a diverse clientele, from couples to families, to college students, which was important for us. All of the waitresses were great and worked well together. I ordered the Farmer's omelette consisting of turkey, mushrooms, spinach, tomato, and cheddar cheese. It also came with onions, but I don't like them. With my omelette, I ordered a bagel and potatoes. J ordered 3 pancakes with a side of breakfast ham and coffee. Everything we are was so delicious! The food was tasty and not too heavy. Everything was around $25, which made J happy. Definitely a place we will be returning to.",

    "text": "Ladies and Gentleman, welcome to pancake heaven. It was several years ago that I first came upon The Dor-Stop, and since then my breakfast lifestyle has been forever changed.  I know this will sound like blasphemy coming from a Dor-Stop convert, but I hate pancakes. I just don't understand them, they are odd and moist, and nowhere near as delicious as waffles. I came into The Dor-Stop the first time with this mindset, and am now forever changed.   The Dor-Stop's hotcakes are delicious and almost cake-like. They aren't thin crepes, or undercooked globs of batter, but instead sweet, fluffy treats that come in a plethora of flavors. I personally endorse oatmeal walnut, but others love the banana or pumpkin (when in season). I recommend ordering the \"Egg Combo\": 2 hot cakes, eggs, and bacon/sausage. Go all out, you deserve it.   On a recent visit, I also discovered the french toast menu, which has caused me to forsake my hot cake habit. The french toast is almost deep fried and covered in this raspberry yogurt. It is a can't miss item on the menu, rivaling that of the hot cake. When pumpkin french toast is a special on the menu, I suggest you run to The Dor-Stop and taste a little of heaven.   I've also sampled various items from the lunch menu with no complaints. The Rachel and Ruben are especially tasty if you feel like bypassing the breakfast menu.   This place is truly heaven in Dor-Stop. Make sure you arrive early on a weekend morning to avoid the crowd! Or wake up at dawn on a weekday and partake (as I have been known to do from time to time!)",

    "text": "Ok, so I know this place is somewhat of an institution now because of their Food Network exposure, but I'm going to have to go against the grain here and say that I did not enjoy my Dor-Stop experience.  We came here many months ago after hearing all of the hype. I'd never been to Dormont before and we were eager to check out this place and the neighborhood in general (side bar: Dormont is adorable! If it were a bit more convenient to where we work and like to play, I would totally live there).   Anyhow, so we get there on a Saturday morning, and the place is packed. No biggie, most good breakfast spots usually have a wait on a weekend morning. I think we waited about 30 mins, which wasn't bad. We're seated, we order, everything is just peachy. Then things started to go sour.  It had been about 40 minutes since we were seated and we still hadn't received our food. Other diners who were seated after us had received their food and were finishing up. Our waitress hadn't stopped by our table in a long time. I had started to wonder if maybe our ticket was lost (ordinarily I wouldn't think anything of it, but the fact that people seated after us had gotten their food made me think something might have been wrong). Anyway, so the next time we see our waitress walk by, we flag her down and ask her if she knew when our food would be out. We asked politely. We weren't snarky, we weren't mean, we didn't roll our eyes or snap our fingers. It was a simple question, one that I think many would probably ask. And the waitress replied, \"Are you really hungry or just really impatient?\" No hint of a smile on her face. No twinkle in her eyes. It was clear that she wasn't joking (not that it would have been funny anyway).   Hmm. Are we really hungry or really impatient? Well, neither...we just wanted to make sure our ticket hadn't gotten lost. We sat in stunned silence, unsure of how we should respond to such a flat-out rude remark. The waitress left, and finally brought our food out about 10 minutes later (and then we never saw her again except for when she dropped off the check). By that point, our appetites were pretty much gone, and we just wanted to leave. So we scarfed down our food and got the heck out of dodge.  I dunno. Maybe the waitress was having a bad day. Maybe she gets asked that question a lot (by actual impatient people) and is sick of hearing it. But we were very polite to her and didn't deserve to be treated like that. I don't care how good your food is (and for the record, the food was okay, but certainly not mind blowing for the all the hype), if you have lousy customer service, I can't support you. And it's a shame, because I really, really wanted to like this place (it looks like such a cute mom and pop place). With so many other great breakfast spots in the Burgh, I'd rather go somewhere that cares about giving their customers a good (or at least not a blatantly bad) experience.",

    "text": "Let's be honest, there are some core diner foods out there that rarely vary from location to location.  For example, scrambled eggs.  I have yet to see someone toss out something like, \"Wow, the eggs were simply divine - fluffy, yellow and...and....fluffy and yellow.\"  Generally speaking, your homemade scrambled eggs probably taste pretty similar to your diner eggs.  Now, let's talk pancakes.  Pancakes are a different beast.  You see, you could add buttermilk, regular milk, water, ice cream, eggs, various flours, and a plethora of additives to create your perfect pancake.  At The Dor-Stop, I received my generics and quite honestly, the pancakes scared me a little.  Why?  Well, because when I put my butter on them, the outer crust made a sound.  Yes, I said crust....on a pancake.  Not pizza....p-a-n-c-a-k-e.  I figured if nothing else, I now had a frisbee to take on my way down to Orlando.  So, I began to slice in to my crusty cake and I noticed a squishiness as I penetrated the outer shell.  How perplexing, I thought!  This felt like a job for Sherlock Holmes!  Since he's not real, I moved on.  I took a bite and I must tell you, these pancakes were flipping awesome.  Yes, that was a flapjack reference.  The crunchy on the outside coupled with the chewy middle were a serious but welcomed surprise.  I had no idea pancakes could have this dichotomy!  I polished off my stack and finished my generics with delight.  If these pancakes did not floor me, I would say this diner is still a slight step above many others of its kind, but these pancakes do give it a leg up.  As far as the environment, it is a diner.  So, it looks and feels like a diner.  The neighborhood is cool, though.  When I went there was some construction but everyone on the streets were friendly and for some reason, \"Come and play...everything's A-OK..\" kept going through my head as I walked down the alleyway.  Now, was there a little green monster peering at me from the lid of a garbage can....?  I guess you'll need to check it out yourself.",

The pancakes were nice golden brown. I hit them with just a touch of salt. Perfect. Scambled eggs were nice and fluffy. The sausage was nicely browned and had just the right flavor kick without being over the top spicy. Buttered toast just the way I like it...lightly toasted. This is a great breakfast spot and I will be back. Got to try that breakfast burrito. That  thing looks big enough to feed a football team . Prices are well worth it for the quality.

Maybe my expectations were too high, but dor stop was simply just alright for me.  I don't want to make it sound like it was a horrible experience. The service was very attentive and friendly while the atmosphere (while small) very nicely evokes the feeling of a diner in small town America.  They have many, many type of pancakes, but I decided to try the normal ones to get a baseline opinion on what they offer. You get three pancakes and they are a decent size. As is tradition some places around the 'burgh, they toss some powdered sugar on top; this isn't really a deal breaker for me, but I'm never excited to see this happening either. The cakes themselves taste alright, but my biggest gripe is how dense these are. I guess it could have been an off day, but these were some of the most-dense pancakes I've ever had. I couldn't even finish them.  My wife had the potato pancakes which were also just ok. Her big issue with them was that they had some kind of sweetener added to the mix. I'm not an expert on potato pancakes, but they've usually been more savory than sweet in my experience. Again, I can't say they were bad, but not what we expected based on past experiences. We both agreed the sausage patties were pretty good.  All in all, I might give dor stop another shot if we were in the area, but it didn't live up to my (maybe unrealistic) expectations based on their accolades and what others have said.",

    "text": "When we were planning this trip to Pittsburgh the Dor Stop was one of my 'musts' for breakfast. Wifey and I were here on a Saturday and I was a little surprised we didn't have to wait (certainly wasn't disappointed).   I had a huge breakfast the day before so I thought what I ordered would be a bit more normal, but their portions are pretty good sized. I ordered the Walnut French Toast and two fried eggs. Wifey had the Eggs Benedict with poached eggs and we both had  coffee.   Wifey LOVED her meal as she hadn't had really good eggs Benedict this good in years. My eggs were, well they were eggs...but the walnut French toast was fantastic - tasty, cooked perfectly and filling. Didn't leave a crumb.   This old-school Diner is an excellent stop if you're going to visit Pittsburgh. Excellent food, great and friendly service, and the place was pretty damn clean.   <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedorstoprestaurant.com&s=951ff79c4f714d4350398c7007e1055a97ed630d60f4129b74bd0a3b0d151446\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">thedorstoprestaurant.com</a>  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.foodnetwork.com%2Fshows%2Fdiners-drive-ins-and-dives%2Fvideos%2Fwhats-for-breakfast&s=f921bbf50795b9dcf26cfca7500c8a35b0f561b7b33caba92eacd2eef36709a8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">foodnetwork.com/shows/di...</a>",

I'm your typical Pittsburgher and it takes me time to cross that bridge and go through that tunnel.  But slowly I am making my way to other neighborhoods in the city, more so now than ever before.  I knew what I was walking into when coming here.  Diner style food, and of course that always sounds amazing to me.  We got here at the end of their day, so the place wasn't busy at all.  Walked right in and found ourselves a seat.  Menus in hand seconds later and I already spotted what I wanted.  Hot meatloaf sandwich, my old go to when I come to this type of place.    While waiting for our food it gives you a chance to looking.  Even though it looks corny, I loved the tables with the advertisements for other nearby local businesses.  The place was clean and very welcoming.  Staff were on top of their game and never missed a beat.  Then the food finally arrived.  I loved the meatloaf.  Full of flavor and definitely hit the spot for me.  The fries covered with gravy were definitely delicious.  Kind of made me want a second helping after I finished.  I refrained, but I should have gotten one to go.",

So it was no real surprise to me that my wife chose this restaurant specifically for that feature. She grew up in the area but was looking for a good place with a good reputation to meet a friend for a late breakfast. Apparently there were a number of other people thinking the same sort of thing as there was a line out the door when we arrived (it was the holidays, too). This did not last too long as there was a bunch of tables that turned over all at once.   It's a solid little corner diner in town with a menu that doesn't have a lot of trendy flair. It's your basics with some variety in their preparation (different types of pancakes, French toast, omelets, etc.) that would make it almost impossible for people not to find something that they would like. We each settled on something different from the others (breakfasts burrito, bacon and egg combo, eggs Benedict special), and everyone seemed happy with their choices. How often does that happen?  Portion sizes were just right so that everyone left satiated. Super friendly staff in front and behind the counter. We would come qbck here again!",

It already comes with cream and flavor (I think vanilla). Very tasty! I highly recommend this place. There's only street parking you pay for, but I found a side street so I didn't have to pay.",

Foods I've loved: Eggs Benedict - the ham is a generous serving and really good on the Italian toast which is a twist on the classic. The potatoes are so tasty especially with the Hollandaise sauce. The Jumbot sandwiches are really hearty and filling too, just could use sauce. The Grilled cheese sandwich is surprisingly good also with all the different cheese flavors.  My husband likes the meatloaf sandwich, the monte Cristo, and Texas French toast. All are hearty choices!   The food always comes out pretty quickly too and staff is always pleasant and friendly.",

    "text": "Boston has Cheers.  Dormont has the Dor-Stop.    When I moved to Dormont a few years ago, I was told about this amazing breakfast place that was featured on the Food Networks show, \"Diners Drive-Ins, & Dives\".  I now know why this place is a Pittsburgh staple - Delicious food, Friendly service, and a Cozy atmosphere.  If you go on the weekend, you'll typically see a line.  Don't let it turn you away!  It usually moves quick and its worth the wait.  It's a small diner atmosphere, so i wouldn't recommend it for parties larger than 4.  Once you get inside, I assure you that you'll be hooked, too.  I've tried several things on their menu - The breakfast burrito - HUGE and delicious with eggs, potatoes, sausage... The pancakes - dense and hearty!  The French toast - who would have thought cornflakes applied to this would make it even yummier?  And my FAVORITE - Vicki's Jumpot - Everything you could ever want in a breakfast!  Eggs, potatoes, ham, cheese, peppers, onions... and though it comes with Italian toast, I swap it for some of the best marble rye in the area.  Incredibly filling, big portions but little prices and always tasty.  Yes, it's got to the point where the hostess knows my name when we enter - \"Ashley, party of 2?\"  That's me!  I look forward to any Sunday I get to dine at the Dor-Stop.  Sometimes you've gotta go where everybody knows your name...",

    "text": "I visited the Dor Stop for brunch this past Sat. with CM.  Given that we were headed out to South Park for a hike, and we wanted to get brunch beforehand, I suggested we take the opportunity to try the Dor Stop, since Dormont was on the way and I'd heard great things about their brunch (not to mention that they were on DDD!).  In hopes of beating the late-rising rush, we arrived at around 10:30, and it worked out perfectly, since we only had to wait about 15 min. to be seated.  Once we were seated, we were promptly greeted and given menus by one of the waitstaff.  Having checked out the reviews ahead of time, I knew I wanted to try the raspberry French toast.  I mentioned the other items that had been featured on DDD--and that people enjoy, based on the reviews--to CM, and he decided to go with the famous pumpkin pancakes (yeah, that's what I call them, rather than hot cakes--so sue me!).  Our order was taken promptly, and was delivered to our table about 10 min. after ordering.  My French toast looked exactly like I expected, based on the pictures--it consisted of four toast points covered with raspberry sauce, and drizzled with raspberry jam.  The toast was perfectly crispy, and the sauce was delicious and flavorful--it was everything I could want in a sweet brunch item!  However, I did find the name of this dish a bit misleading, since the toast itself wasn't actually stuffed, unlike other versions I've tried before.  I tried a bite of CM's pumpkin pancakes, and they were also delectable--unlike most pancakes I've had, they were quite moist even without any syrup, and definitely included real pumpkin, rather than just pumpkin pie spice, like many pumpkin items I've tried.  The butter added some welcome savoriness to the sweetness of the pancakes, and a bit of syrup added some additional moistness.  Since both of our dishes came with a breakfast meat, we ordered bacon (duh!), which provided us with a supply of umami flavor when we wanted a break from the sweetness of our entrees.  Overall, CM and I were very pleased with our experience at the Dor Stop.  Our total check, which included a glass of milk for me in addition to our entrees, came to around $20, which we felt was quite reasonable in light of the quality of the dishes.  Service was friendly and efficient, and the ambiance was cheerful and light-filled--exactly what I'd expect in a diner.  Even though we both felt a tad out of place among the clientele, which was almost completely white families with young children (very different than your typical East End eating establishment, which is what we're both accustomed to), we felt welcome.  Without a doubt, the Dor-Stop offers one of the best breakfasts in PGH, and doesn't disappoint for down home diner goodness!",

I was excited by the menu choices and decided to give it a try.  Unfortunately, I was completely disappointed with my experience as was my guest.  We ordered Monte Cristo sandwiches and potato pancakes.  Normally, I love both but the sandwich was different than other Monte Cristo sandwiches I've had and did not taste good.  The potato pancakes were the worst I've ever had also.  The sandwiches did not come with cole slaw as they were supposed to and the waitress said it was because we ordered the potato pancakes instead.  However, when the bill arrived, I was charged full ala carte price for them.  I didn't feel like bringing it up since staff was obviously in a rush to get out of there even though we came in plenty of time to finish our meals.  I left most of it behind and when I said I did not want a box, I was never asked if I wanted something else or offered a discount even though it was obvious I didn't like what I had.  Instead, we made a decision to not return even though we were hoping to like it enough to come back.  We're not terribly picky eaters either.",

We were looking for a good breakfast place on Saturday and I found this one on Yelp. The reviews were great and the pictures looked so good that we had to give it a try. Thank you yelpers for helping me find this gem!  I had the Jumbot \"Guy style\". It was so good I HAD to eat the whole thing. Which was no easy feat considering how big of a plate it was. A heaping plate of everything but the kitchen sink. Eggs, hash browns, pepper jack cheese, onions, peppers, hot sausage, and more! On top if that, my boyfriend and I had to try a specialty pancake as well. Luckily you can get just one. We had the apple cinnamon cake and it was absolutely heavenly. Crispy on the outside with a doughy, yet done, center. It melted in your mouth!  He had the regular breakfast with the potato pancakes which The Dor-stop is apparently known for. I didn't get a chance to try them since he demolished it in mere minutes. I'm assuming they were delicious.   It was reasonably priced and very cute. We were fortunate enough to get a table right away but I've heard there can be a pretty long wait. Sometimes out the door which makes perfect sense after tasting this delicious food.",

These are the fluffiest, most incredibly good and filling hot cakes that I've ever had! I don't know how they do it! I made it through 2 1/2 of them before I hung my head in defeat. But it didn't matter, because I was in my happy place. These cakes are absolute heaven, and if you haven't tried them yet, you are missing out!  I never thought I could get emotional about food, but this is one of those times. I recall my mom once craving crabs from a crab shack in Ft Lauderdale for over 10 years after having them once. I feel like Dor-Stop pancakes will be the equivalent for me. My God, will I miss this place and those hot cakes.",

While I'm thrilled to see Bob and Vicky's crew thriving, I do have to say that I miss being able to actually walk-in on a Saturday or Sunday without a line around the block.  Irregardless, when you're looking for unique spins on traditional diner fare, this is your joint.  The pancakes are all fantastic.  I've had every combination on the menu and then plenty more (they'll usually grant a request if they have the ingredients and they usually run a weekend special).  I highly suggest the apple walnut, banana chocolate chip, the oatmeal raisin, and most importantly...  PUMPKIN (the best in town).  Lori's Raspberry French Toast is the obligatory first dine, just stay away from the other iterations that aren't first coated in corn flakes prior to landing on the griddle.  The jumbots, eggs benedict, and potato pancakes all also represent fantastic choices.  If you have a choice of meat, hands down get the \"ham off the bone\".  One other key note...  Bob, Vicky, and their daughter Lori go out of their way to make people happy.  They always bring samples out to those waiting for a seat and offer coffee to hold people over when it's cold out.  If you're running solo or with one in tow, I recommend you check to see if there are spots at the bar (first come first serve).",

Moist and rich in the middle, just like my favorite pumpkin bread, and crispy on the edges. Didn't even need syrup.  There were a bunch of other delicious sounding pancake options that I wished I could have tried too, like apple cinnamon and banana oatmeal.   Vicki's jumbot was really good too - everything savory and delicious scrambled together. The ham from bone in it was what made it special and I don't even usually like ham. Next time I might just get a side of ham to go with my pancakes :)   Service was great too - real friendly, and everyone kept trying to refill my coffee as if their life depended on it.

I had the Jumbot (the mix of potatoes, eggs, ham. peppers, onion and cheese etc) It was great and hit the spot perfect with a Pumpkin Pancake! The coffee was hot, the service was friendly and quick, and very attentive! Great start to our trip to Pittsburgh!",

They are not of high quality, but everything else is. French Toast is excellent. Pancakes are good, but are really sweet like a donut. You have to be in the mood for them. Like I said they are very sweet. Only negative of this place is the restaurant is small and crammed, it is always packed, and there is always a wait.",

They tasted like they were made from a mix, mushy in the middle, and they came with powdered sugar which I don't like (wish the server told me beforehand). Average wait time to be seated and for food to arrive. OJ was pretty bad as well- like the cheap stuff you get from the grocery store. I like the fact the place is not a chain, and I'd be up for trying other food there, but from my experience the pancakes do not live up to the hype.",

I've seen this place featured on Diners Drive In's and Dives and love all the food places I've been to in Pitt! I've tried a majority of the Pittsburgh staples for breakfast but the Dor Stop by far is the best breakfast I've had in the Pitt! The Orders were Vickie's Jumbot and their famous pancakes (apple walnut) the Jumbot features a mix of eggs veggies home-fries ham topped with Italian toast! Was very good ! The pancakes were amazing filled with hot apples and crushed walnuts them to were amazing... The only thing I was upset about was that they wouldn't allow substitutions and were gonna try and charge me a ridiculous amount to sub turkey for ham at like $5.99, didn't think that was fair, other then that the service was great, people were friendly and it was very enjoyable to go here!",

The menu has typical diner favorites. I ordered the ham off the bone breakfast (with their special ham, potato pancakes, eggs, and toast) and True to form, it was very good (ham was still relatively moist despite having been on the griddle) and was reasonably priced at about $7.     I went around lunch time on a weekday and the restaurant was about half full, so I didn't have to wait. Food came quickly and service was good (even though the young waitress oddly addressed me as \"honey\" every time).  As I was finishing up, an older gentleman, seemingly a \"regular,\" came in and was greeted warmly by the waitstaff. He took a seat at the counter and the staff told him what specials they could make for him. (He ended up getting a chicken salad sandwich on texas toast plus a bowl of soup.) And he chatted with the staff as he enjoyed his lunch. I'm guessing that this guy like many others are regulars here and know what a great place this is and keep coming back.",

    "text": "My husband and I were looking for a new place to try for brunch on Labor Day. Instead of going to our standby, the Original Pancake house, I suggested we try the Dor-Stop. We arrived at 12:30 and were soon joined by the 3rd person in our party. The hostess informed us that we were next on the list for a table and would be seated soon. I was surprised at how busy it was on a holiday. This small little diner was packed with people. Every table was full as well as every seat at the counter. About ten minutes later, a waitress came over and called two parties that arrived after us. My husband had to go talk to her and explain how we were waiting longer. She apologized for skipping us and was able to seat us right away. Once seated, I had a difficult time deciding what to order from the extensive menu. Wow! They have a huge selection.   I finally decided on the special, Apple Harvest French toast with bacon. When I asked the waitress about the special, she had a difficult time describing it but I still wanted to give it a try. Once we ordered, it took well over 15 minutes for our food. I understand that they were very busy but that amount of time did seem a bit excessive for diner food. When my french toast arrived, it was not exactly what I was expecting per the description but, it was very tasty. The french toast had a nice crisp on it and the cream cheese sauce had a lot of flavor. However, for being APPLE harvest french toast, it was certainly lacking apples or apple flavoring. This french toast would have been perfect with slices of cooked apples on top instead of the small apple pieces that were mixed in with the cream cheese. The bacon also lacked a nice crispiness.   I also had the opportunity to try my husband's banana chocolate chip pancakes. Although they looked delicious with the bananas and chocolate chips baked into the pancakes, they tasted rather salty. My husband agreed with my assessment. It seemed like the cook was a little heavy handed when adding salt to the batter. Overall, I wasn't overly impressed though, I would give the Dor Stop a second chance based on their huge selection to choose from.",

Main complaint is the \"sausage wafers\" and \"bacon shavings\".   Since these are the most expensive items for the owner, he/she provides the customer with sausage thinner than a quarter and see-through bacon, with very small portions for both.  Did not try pancakes, but will assume they will be good since pancake batter leans more toward low-cost such as oatmeal, cereal, other such items.  Will not return.  Sausage was also greasy and very little spices to it, more like it was microwaved.  Forget your dreams of a thick, burger like fresh sausage patty filled with sage and other country spices that is about 4 ounces thick and substantial...what you will get instead at the Dor-Stop is a lukewarm, greasy, wafer-like sausage impersonation.  Forget about your dreams of thick, sizzling hot, applwood smoked bacon slices that are 6 inches long and quarter-inch thick.  What you will get instead at the Dor-Stop is lukewarm bacon pieces/shavings that are greasy and see-through.  This is all the truth.",

Cute place with good service and hearty food.  Everything was fresh and homemade.    They are open until 2pm on Sunday.  We got there around 1pm and it was a difficult decision - breakfast or lunch?  Breakfast or lunch?  We both chose lunch.  Delicious sandwiches - I had the pittsburgh turkey sandwich (turkey, swiss, french fries on grilled italian bread --- served with POTATO PANCAKES!), he had the Chic O' Philly Hoagie (chicken, onions, peppers, lettuce, tomato, and cheese on a split loaf with french fries).  German potato pancakes are delicious! We spent about $20 and had a filling but not too ridiculous meal.",

The atmosphere is friendly and bustling. The menu seems nicely edited, and apparently they make lots of their ingredients from scratch. I had 2 eggs over medium, their in-house ham from the bone, Texas toast and potato pancakes which came with my choice of applesauce or sour cream (I got sour cream). The eggs were cooked perfectly, and the ham was nice-- just salty enough. The potato pancakes were different than what I expected. I thought they would be like fried hashbrown cakes, but they were shredded potatoes mixed with a pancake-like batter. They weren't crispy or hot, and just kind of underwhelming. I'll be back though since they have grits :)",

I've heard about this place even before I moved here and I was pretty sure we'd be coming here at least few times a month. But nevertheless, I could never bring myself to stop by especially when the line to get in usually starts a block away from the restaurant.   However, this past Sunday was a different story - perhaps because we came in later than the normal breakfast hour. There wasn't much of a line and the wait wasn't too long either. Although the place itself was pretty full.  The servers were friendly and attentive in handling our group of 6. The coffee along with the refill came in time - so did our food. I got the All American Breakfast with a beef patty, rye toast, 2 eggs and the Lyonaise potatoes with onions. Loved every bit of it. My S.O. got the spicy omelete which was needless to say quite \"spicy\" which came with a toast and potatoes (without onions). I was a bit confused since the menu said that it came with fries which I assumed was french fries. Regardless, it was delicious and quite filling.  The price is reasonable and the portion is just about right.",

And if you're with a really good friend, you can order two different ones and split them! Genius!  I split the banana chocolate chip pancakes and the pumpkin pancakes. While the pumpkin was incredible, I think I slightly more enjoyed the banana chocolate chip just because the combo is such a winning one! But come fall, I may be all over the pumpkin ones again. Although, I'd probably be cheating myself because I have to work my way down the list of them all!  The only thing that would pull me away would be the french toast. It almost seems cruel I have to choose between the two! And it's so dirt cheap too! I think for three people it was around $25 bucks. With coffee and some sides!

Even on a weekday at 11am, expect to find this place quite crowded!  We waited about 15 minutes for our table.  Pittsburgh was our last pit stop (no pun intended) on our roadtrip to the Midwest in mid-October and we decided to eat at the best restaurant we could find for lunch.  I ordered the steak n cheese hoagie and loved it.  It came with thin slices of steak, swiss cheese, sauteed onions, green peppers, diced tomatoes, and shredded lettuce.  It was served with fries.  I really appreciated how much steak was in my sandwich - they sure were generous!    They have a number of breakfast-type foods on the menu as well, if you're so inclined.  The French toast looked quite appetizing, and something I would definitely get if I visited again in the future.  Service was really friendly and homey at this restaurant too.  The only issue is the parking situation - it's pretty much a \"find-a-spot-if-you're-lucky\" street parking type place.  But if you are driving through Pittsburgh and you do find parking in the vicinity, definitely check Dor-Stop out!",

The wait was torturous at the Dor-Stop too...however, it was a holiday so I suppose i understand.  And when we did finally get seated, the AMAZING hot cakes, SUPERB hash browns, and perfectly cooked eggs really made my morning!  I prefer my hot cakes to be thin and flat, and when I saw the ones here, I was unsure again.  But the taste will BLOW YOUR MIND.  I got the apple cinnamon ones - they are crispy yet fluffy with apples that taste very fresh and just the right amount of cinnamon.  I even enjoyed the butter as a sweet additive to a decadent treat!  The potatoes were also amazing - True lyonnaise style with crispy outsides, warm insides, and plenty of onions.  Eggs were standard fair, but overeasy is often executed poorly... so props for getting it exactly right.  Several of my friends also ordered different flavors of hot cakes and suggested the oatmeal ones are really not to be missed as well.  Despite the long wait and weird waitress, we all LOVED our breakfast and I was full for hours after.  YUM!  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Though Pittsburgh is flooded with incredible B/L/D locations and is quickly becoming a foodie destination, Dor-Stop remains one of my favorite breakfast places (if you can get in!).   The food has that home-cooked comfort food taste every pallet can appreciate. The \"greasy spoon\" vibe here is charming and extremely low-key, though their pride regarding appearing in Diners Drive-Ins and Dives is made very apparent (and rightfully so).  I variety of specialty pancakes is very enticing. We're not talking crepes here either. These things are a seriously thick, wide cake feast. I personally love the oatmeal pancakes the most, but enjoy every kind I try. The Raspberry filled French toast is now my favorite dish. It's not truly filled, but rather \"crowned\" with a creaming light raspberry filling. The toast is crusted in corn flakes, which doesn't sound as good as it actually is.  I have visited with friends and enjoyed the experience, but only recently did I bring my 4yr old and 3yr old nephew and niece--a dangerous proposition at many restaurants. We were greeted with a smile upon arrive and the children received special placemats and crayons to keep them occupied while we waited a short period of time for our breakfast. The children's selections were appropriately prices and portioned and at no point in time did I feel as though I had made a mistake bringing them to one of my favorite breakfast locations.",

My friend and I split the Raspberry-stuffed French Toast and the Spinach, Tomato and Feta Omelette. We got sides of Bacon, Home Fries and Toast. I thought the Omelette was great- ingredients were fresh, and it wasn't as greasy as I thought it would be. The Home Fries were my favorite since they were more like smashed potatoes, and it was different from your typical diner home fry. The Raspberry-stuffed French Toast was a disappointment. It wasn't stuffed at all- it was thickly breaded (maybe crushed corn flakes?) and drenched in raspberry sauce. The dish overall was OK, but not worth the hike from home. My friend also got the tomato juice- couldn't really tell if it was freshly juiced or not.  Though I am curious about their pancakes, this visit wasn't worth it for me to make the 20-25 minute drive out here. The service was fast and efficient, not particularly friendly, which is fine with me. The meal was very affordable.",

That is how I discovered this place and I am super glad I did!   They are famous for their pancakes and it is clear why that is- their amazing. I've had their banana oatmeal, pumpkin and banana pancakes. All amazing and HUGE. Their Italian jumbot was also featured on the show- incredible and spicy which is what I really liked about it. Their hot chocolate is amazing- sooo chocolatey and just the best hot coco around.   The service is that of a typical diner, so nothing amazing. It's small and not meant for people to stay and chat for hours.   Overall, I adore the dor stop. Super cute and always delicious. A favorite for sure.",

We waited a while to get in the door, but it was nice enough outside, so I didn't mind.  Once inside, it definitely has an old diner feel.  The staff were friendly and attentive, though our order did get mixed up and came out in three separate chunks.    As far as food, my banana chocolate chip pancakes were perhaps a little doughy, but I did enjoy them.   The highlight though was the potato pancake - tons of flavor and a nice texture.   Be forewarned though that it comes with very tiny little thimbles of sour cream and applesauce.  Definitely ask for extra if you are going to order that.    All in all, it's a good version of a community diner.  The menu is pretty big and it is very popular.  I am not sure I'd wait regularly though.",

We were good with being told it would take 25/30 minutes to get a table for four. Ten minutes later we were being seated. The restaurant offers a large menu; everyone should be able to find something to their liking. Everyone ordered something different at our table. It came quickly, was hot and most importantly, tasty. I had the Crab Benedict. Real Crab folks! The Hollandaise sauce was prepared nicely and the fried potatoes were excellent. My wife had the stuffed strawberry French toast. She said it was great. Coffee refills were timely and the overall cost was pretty reasonable. If I lived in the area, I'd be a regular.",

    "text": "My husband and I took my parents to The Dor-Stop to try a new place for Sunday brunch. The first thing that caught my eye was that this restaurant was visited by Guy Fieri on his Food Network TV Show \"Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives\"! Being a Food Network lover myself, I was pleasantly surprised. We arrived at 10:30am and had to make our way through the line of waiting people to put our name in for table. The line extended out of the door as we were told it would be about a half hour before we were seated which was reasonable considering the length of the line. We were seated within that time frame as the lined continued to grow.   After we were seated we were instantly served by a waitress with water and any additional beverages that were requested. The menu had selections focused on breakfast and lunch, a variety that would satisfy anyone walking through the door. From eggs, hot cakes, and french toast, to burgers, and sandwiches, the options are there. I ordered the Banana Chocolate Chip Premium Hot Cakes as recommended by our waitress and they were outstanding! They were loaded with chocolate chips and bananas alike, with both items used as toppings as well. I could not have been more pleased with my selection. My mother ordered the Stuffed  Raspberry French Toast, the feature on Guy's TV Show, and it was exceptional. The portions were more than generous and the service was excellent. The waitresses worked together to make sure that all the customers needs were met especially as the waiting line continue to grow outside of the restaurant's walls.  The interior of the diner has a retro feel with a multi-colored tile floor, small booths and tables with limited walking space in between, a sit down food bar with old fashioned bar stools, and a color palette of greens and tans throughout. Numerous pictures of individuals were scattered on the walls and large windows with deep window sills allow customers to observe the streets of Dormont. There is free on-street parking throughout the area but if one chooses to go on a weekend, as we did, one may have to walk a few blocks to the restaurant.   If you are willing to wait outside or in tight spaces for a half hour for diner food, this is a place you must try! Make sure to stop by before early afternoon breakfast, brunch, or lunch as they close by 3pm Mon-Sat, and 2pm on Sunday!",

It was covered in the pumpkin spread which I worried would be too sweet but it was just right. It came with a few strips of crispy bacon.   The guys jumbot was a melting pot of delicious ingredients including eggs,  potatoes,  jalapenos, hot Italian sausage and cheese. At first,  we thought it would be spicy on the account of the sausage and jalapeno but it wasn't,  instead it brought the dish to life. The Italian toast really brought this powerhouse of flavors home. Becareful the portion is large and can fill you up quickly.    Will definitely return for another delicious breakfast one of these mornings.",

For the numerous times that I've been here, the fact that I've NEVER had a bad experience is somewhat of an anomaly. I've had breakfast all across the city, and the Dor-Stop is the only place worth crossing a river or driving through a tunnel to dine at. I wouldn't recommend coming here on the weekends unless you don't mind waiting 20-45 minutes for a seat, but if you're dead set on some top notch breakfast, it's definitely worth the wait.",

Beware, though - the eggs Benedict are not served in typical fashion. It is the size of the plate and served with potatoes. The toppings were placed on top of several slices of (good) Italian bread.   Some reviewers mention the servers. Yes - a bit short, however, expected with as busy as they are. Our waitress was short, but extremely nice, attentive and we had great customer service. I think they just want to turn tables since there are so many people waiting in such a small space.   Expect a wait - put your name on the list & expect a minimum wait of 30 minutes. We took our hockey team and they were very accommodating in separating and seating us at several tables when they were available.",

Decided to get the stuffed raspberry French toast (which looked really good in photos so I knew I had to get it), sausage patties (you get one meat option with the French toast), and German potato pancakes. To be honest, I didn't think the food was amazing. I did enjoy the raspberry French toast, but like most people have already mentioned, it wasn't exactly stuffed. Sausage patties are a staple brunch meat for me, but these tasted microwaved and like they've been sitting out for a while. The potato pancakes I was pretty excited for, but they didn't taste like the potato pancakes I've had at German restaurants, so it wasn't what I thought it'd be. The French toast alone I would give 4 stars out of 5, but the sides I got bring my taste rating for Dor-Stop down. Although I would consider coming back, I'd definitely order different sides.  Taste | 3 Atmosphere | 3 Presentation | 3.5 Service | 3.5 OVERALL | 3.5",

We came here over a weekend right after Christmas, and expected a fairly long wait, but we were seated in just about 15 minutes.  My partner and I really wanted to get both the rasberry french toast and the guy version's jumbot, so we decided to share our portions in half. Since we don't eat meat, the waitress offered to replace the meat on the side with potatoes. My oh my, the rasberry french toast was out of the world! The jam was so delicious and tasty, and the toasts were made to perfection. The jumbot was very good too, with the eggs perfectly done and had a perfect blend of potatoes, peppers, jalapenos and more. We even liked their brewed coffee a lot.   The service was very warm and attentive, and not displeasing like some other \"famous\" brunch spots around the city. I am already planning my next brunch here.",

We went on a Sunday morning and was told the wait would be 20 minutes. After about 10, four seats opened up at the counter so we snagged them. We got to know the staff as we perused the menu. We were right next to the cash register and the (I'm assuming) owner was a gentle drill sergeant doling out orders.   I had the banana chocolate chip pancakes with a side of sausage. The three generously-sized pancakes were sweet with a crispy edge and were loaded with fruit and chocolate. Ohmygod. Some of the best pancakes I've ever had. I stuffed myself silly knowing I wouldn't be able to come back next weekend and do it all again. The sausage patties were really tasty and not greasy at all. I had to fend off T who kept getting samples. :) I also tried T's apple cinnamon pancakes which had dollops of apple pie filling and just the right amount of cinnamon. My father-in-law had the strawberry-stuffed French toast and my mother-in-law had the walnut French toast. I didn't try either but they looked amazing.   I would DEFINITELY come back here if I lived in the area. Pay no mind to the wait time. Bring a book, bring someone you love to chat with. It's worth it!",

I ordered the oatmeal walnut pancakes with a side of sausages. The pancakes were really good and I was pleasantly surprised since I didn't know what to expect.  The only reason why I am not giving this place 5 stars is that when we were done eating and ready to pay our waitress all of sudden brought me a pancake and said there was a shortage of pancakes so she was sorry. I thought it was a bit deceptive on her end for not mentioning this to me earlier when she served us our food.  Because when we received our food I thought it was strange that I only received two stacks of pancakes, but didn't question it thinking that since it was a \"specialty pancake\" I was suppose to only get two. It couldve been an honest mistake, but I still felt that she should have mention this to me earlier.",

My boyfriend and I were on our way from Milwaukee, WI to Easton, PA and figured we should find some good food along the way, and The Dor-Stop fit the bill - we'd be arriving near Pittsburgh at just the right time for breakfast.   This place was bustling - we got there at about 8:30am on a Saturday, but we only had to wait a few minutes.   Our waitress was sweet and courteous and she told us about the popular items on the menu because we'd told her it was our first time there.   He and I both got the Eggs Combo - two eggs, choice of meat (bacon, sausage or ham off the bone). He got banana pancakes and bacon and I got pumpkin pancakes with the ham.   The ham was wonderful - albeit a little salty (but all ham tastes salty to me), but by the time I finished my perfect over-medium eggs and one of my pancakes I was pretty full, so I wasn't able to finish the ham. That didn't stop me from sneaking a couple of bites of my boyfriend's banana pancakes though!   If I ever find myself driving east again, I will be sure to take the detour out to the Dor-Stop. I will be dreaming about the pumpkin pancakes until I can manage to somehow make something half as good.   Absolutely amazing! Best. Pancakes. Ever.",

Go only with 2-4 people (otherwise you are one of THOSE parties that will hold everything up and screw up the seating) 2. Be prepared to wait.  If you do not wait, consider yourself the luckiest person alive. 3. Order something savory (may I recommend the Breakfast Burrito or the Eggs Benedict?  Everything has a twist and a funny name, so you're going to spend some time actually reading the menu.  Get something special, don't just go with scrambled eggs and bacon - although I'm sure that's delicious too). 4. Order specialty pancakes \"for the table\" (to share).  We haven't been able to get away from the drawing power of the pumpkin pancakes yet.  They are so thick, yet so fluffy at the same time!  The surprising news: they take credit cards (it gives off a \"cash only\" vibe).  The opportunity area: syrup that does not come in an old-fashioned squeeze bottle!  It takes me about 15 minutes to get the disgusting amount of syrup I want atop my fluffy pancakes.",

I savored every bite, and my only issue was that there wasn't more.  :( As always the restaurant was packed and loud. I love that about the Dor-Stop b/c it's so Pittsburgh.  Did I mention how much I love this place?!?!",

    "text": "This place has a great reputation.  It probably makes it more popular than it otherwise should be.  I really tried to sample what they are known for as I do many places I visit for the first time.  Turns out they know what they are doing.    This is your quintessential diner.  Friendly, sassy staff that make you feel like you are at home.   Wait for a table (because there will be a wait) or try to snag a seat at the counter either way you are getting big portions served to you quickly.    I got the jumbot (basically an egg scramble with various meats and veg) with the hot sausage and a side of German potato pancakes.   The hot sausage made what would have been a relatively pedestrian dish quite good. I probably could have ate just a bowl of that. The second best thing I tried there was the potato pancake.  Really nice flavor and they give you the option of sour cream or applesauce as a condiment.  I tried both and the sour cream was the clear winner there.  I tried my wife's chocolate chip banana pancake and it was also quite good.    Nice diner doing a good job serving the community.  The food is probably somewhere between 3.5 and 4 stars but because of the intangibles it gets rounded up.",

I'm not a big fan of the potatoes of any version at Dor-Stop, and I think to me, that's the biggest disappointment.  Other than that, the pancakes alone are worth a trip!",

From my perspective, I detest their service, the service is notoriously horrible and unacceptable. Also the food was unpalatable. I order pumpkin flavor pancakes and side order scramble eggs. I was too full and their portion is huge so I left two pieces of pancakes. The waitress don't even bother to ask me if I need a box to take it home or if everything is good. Although she did refilled my coffee once, I barely see her stop by and there wasn't too many people in the diner is isn't likely she is occupied by that amount of customers.I think the waitress was rude because she never say thank you during the entire breakfast even when I tipped her. I should have known, I just feel like they treated me differently that's all. This review is based on my dinning experience and the service. Seriously if they mean business they should improve. Especially waitress was lack of enthusiasm. Do I want to come back? Never ever.",

They were packed so it took about 30 minutes to get our food but she kept our glasses of iced tea filled the whole time (and brought out a new glass of ice for each of us to refill).  I ordered the pancakes while my friend ordered a vegetarian omelet.  We ordered one order of potato pancakes to share.    Both us really enjoyed our meals a lot!

    "text": "Well I've finally had a chance to visit the now famous Dor-Stop.  I went on a weekday morning so that I could actually get a seat and have the food at it's prime--not cooked in a hurry to see how the food really was.  Well, that was also the only time I had, as well.  I was greeted quickly and seated and given a nice cup of coffee.  They did an exceptional job of keeping the coffee mugs full (another reason  to go on a weekday) and it was good coffee.    I had to try the hot cakes, but didn't want to OD on carbohydrates so I got the Egg Combo with the speciality hotcakes.  The waitress recommended the banana oatmeal or the apple cinnamon.  I went with the banana oatmeal.  Two over easy eggs and bacon, though they offer sausage patties or links in both regular (sage) and hot.  My food came quickly and I was disappointed to find the eggs sharing the plate with the hotcakes.  I like my food separated and dippy eggs leave a residue that sometimes can't be mopped up with bacon.  I guess I would have preferred a plate with the eggs/bacon and a plate with the hotcakes.    The eggs were cooked perfectly as was the bacon.  Crispy yet chewy.  I have to eat my eggs and bacon before I can eat my hotcakes, because, again, I don't like my food touching--especially something sweet and savory.    Let's talk about the hotcakes.  They were served with a big dollop of whipped butter which I loved.  Whipped butter spreads pretty easy.  I like that.  I'm picky.  Especially with breakfast.  There were slices of banana cooked in which I also liked.  They tasted like a diabetics worst/best nightmare.  They were sweet and fork tender like a nice pancake should be.  They would have been fine without syrup.  When I added syrup it felt like I was eating a slightly sweeter version of banana bread.  I wanted to stop at one.  I really did.  I really really did.  I was getting full.  I can stop eating food that isn't good without much of a problem.  I had a problem with that second hotcake  My other \"complaint\" is that is is rather expensive for a small diner.  I paid a little over $10 for my breakfast.  For $10, I would have preferred a more generous portion of bacon, at least.  My idea of pricing is a bit off, I guess, mainly because I live in an area outside of Pittsburgh that is a lot less expensive.    So, I will go back, for sure.  The breakfast is GOOD and I think most places that attempt to serve breakfast should be GOOD.",

Honestly, if not for the peppers, I really don't think that I would have cared for it too much - it would have been quite bland, and I still used a lot of ketchup on it. Having said that, it was still filling and tasted pretty good. My friend had their french toast - filled with raspberries. We both liked that very much - light, not too sweet, and tasty.",

    "text": "Let's start with the conclusion - this place is the very best breakfast diner in Pittsburgh.    Why?  In very large part, because *everything* on the menu is made fresh daily.  This includes the ham, which the restaurant roasts every morning, complete with their own glaze.  The ham is cut from the bone to order, absolutely succulent, with a hint of clove.  The ham alone is reason enough to visit this place, but that isn't even the best offering.  First are the pancakes, which includes specialty pancakes like apple and cinnamon and pumpkin - all of which (including buttermilk pancakes) are among the very best pancakes I've ever eaten.  The batter is prepared fresh every morning.  They have a slightly crispy exterior (plenty of butter and sugar in the batter) and fluffy center.  The apple and cinnamon pancakes are so good that I don't even eat them with syrup lest I mask the subtle flavors of cinnamon, cream, vanilla, and apples in the batter - a dusting of powdered sugar and a smear of half-melted butter is all that's needed to elicit an involuntary eyes-rolling-into-the-back-of-the-head expression of pleasure.  Seriously, these pancakes are DAMN good!  Second, all the egg entrees are fabulous!  Try the eggs benedict - that juicy ham, fresh cut from the bone, piled high atop two thick slabs of toasted Italian bread, topped with sunny-side-up eggs, and freshly prepared hollandaise.  Fantastic.  The omelets are great, and the \"jumbot\" - an \"everything in the prep table\" hash of stuff and scrambled eggs will satisfy the heartiest of diners.  The food here is really top-notch.  I realize that it's just a diner, but when I see and taste food this good, and this lovingly prepared, I want to see *everything* as perfect as most of the food.  With that in mind, I'd really like to see the restaurant offer real maple syrup - not the imitation \"table syrup\" stuff that I've seen them pour from a milk-carton-type paper container into the syrup bottles!  I'd gladly even pay a $1 premium to have real syrup with those delectable pancakes.  Also, I'd beg them to consider making their own biscuits, and possible serving them with a sausage (or sausage and herb?) gravy.  I'd *crawl* to the Dor-Stop from my home to eat there!  This place is PACKED on the weekends - be prepared to wait unless you get there very early.  The wait, however, will be worth it.  I eat here at least once nearly every weekend for breakfast.",
