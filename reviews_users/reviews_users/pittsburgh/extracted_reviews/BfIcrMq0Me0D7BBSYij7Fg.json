It was about 6:30 and they were just locking the doors as we walked up. They saw the looks on the kids faces and opened back up to give us cones. Seriously awesome service and made the kids day!!!! Thank you!!!",

    "text": "An ice cream parlor is supposed to be a happy place, unless you step foot into Difiore's. The outside promises so much till you walk in to a tiny lobby and rude staff pissed off that you're ordering ice cream from them.   We visited on a Sunday night and the (who I'm assuming) manager wasn't accommodating. Within 15 seconds he expected us to have made a choice and pointed to the options we had. Chill, sir. He seemed annoyed that we even stepped in. Strike one. The ice cream itself is nothing special. Typical soft serve that you get at a self-serve buffet. The worst part about it was it wasn't even cold. My frozen yogurt was already melting by the time I was handed my cone. I asked for a bowl since it was dripping and of course that was like asking for a first born. Two cones came to almost $10! Insane! Talk about a tourist trap. Strike two. The thing that bothered me the most during our visit was when my friend asked for his ice cream to be dipped on hot fudge. The guy told him \"No, man. It's too big.\" I've been to many ice cream parlors and a cone is never to big for dipping. Maybe the problem is that fact that your ice cream isn't cold and doesn't stay sturdy (and the fact that you're rude as ever). Your job as an employee (business owner) is to accomadate guests. Offer him hot fudge on the side! Jeez! Strike three. You're out, DiFiore's.   Save the aggravation and head to Page's on Carson Street. Much better service and product. I'm giving them two stars rather than one based on location alone. I guess you are allowed to give lousy service if you're the only ice cream shop in the area...",

There you go, no competition!  The owner HAS to make a killing scoopin out the cones in the summer, for sure.  My fav flavor is the Birthday Cake ice cream.  It has cake, frosting and sprinkles mixed in.  YUMMO!  I was not a fan of the chocolate milkshake only because I don't like chocolate ice cream (I know, I'm weird) and they make it with that and choco syrup.  Too much!  If you're looking to go all out, the Brownie Sundae is divine!    So try to go on the off peak times like....the winter?    There's no fighting a strong urge for ice cream in the summer though, so if there's a long line, I'd still wait.  It moves fast, don't fight the urge!",

    "text": "Note: CASH ONLY!  Soft serve ice cream is a unique animal. Its velvety, ethereal. It takes on the shape of a candle when poured from the humming machines that produce it. It must be consumed quickly in the heat to avoid ice cream cone catastrophe.   It is what Difiore's excels at. Sure they have the harder variety, but for some reason, when I see the design of soft serve, one that recalls birthday cake decoration, I must have it.  Cookie Fantasy Delite: The name alone conjures decadence. To have it before me in a plastic dish was sin incarnate, especially when the two discs of dough and chocolate chips took on the copious amount of hot fudge that was pumped throughout the sundae. There was so much of the deadly sauce, the bottom of the transparent \"boat\"  almost became too warm to hold, making me devour the ice cream faster with Kay's help for fear of a dairy meltdown. The cookies were chewy, the lightness of the soft serve cut the evil of the hot fudge down a notch, and the canned whipped topping and Oreo detritus merely played the role of garnish.   A tourist trap? If so, this lifelong Pittsburgher stumbled into it willingly, and business is deservedly swinging, so much so, the small storefront could not contain the mass of sweet-craving humanity yesterday evening. Miraculously enough, we found a table in the corner. Although, we practically had to fight our way out of there after finishing our dessert.   This brings me to Howard Todd, the owner of both Difiore's and neighboring coffee hut Grand Brew. Mr. Todd is either superhuman or an android as this year he officially logged 2,000 consecutive days at work.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wtae.com%2Fnews%2Flocal%2Fallegheny%2FGrandkids-inspire-ironman-worker-to-reach-2-000th-consecutive-day-on-job%2F-%2F10927008%2F12535870%2F-%2Frtyspyz%2F-%2Findex.html&s=b40d79f76868ccd31efe4111a43ac2c0b609b788f679513207ffe9dc8db59c24\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">wtae.com/news/local/alle...</a>  And watching him handle patron after patron without a single missed note or display of agitation was astonishing.",

Their selection of flavors was pretty standard, with soft-serve and hand-dipped ice cream and a variety of cones or cups. I had hand-dipped peach ice cream in a cake cone, which was pretty good, and everyone else seemed to enjoy their ice cream too. The serving size was decent, though the price is a little higher than other places I've been to.",

However, sometimes the service is spotty. It strikes me as the kind of place that makes most of its money off tourists that come up the incline - since most of its customers aren't regulars, they don't have to have great service.  That said, I live in the neighborhood and still go fairly regularly, since it's convenient and the quality is good. However, if I REALLY want good ice cream, I always head down to Page's Dairy Mart.",

The prices are a little steep, but in that area, there's not much to snack on, so I was fine forking over $5 for a cup. They ONLY TAKE CASH, so keep that in mind when you visit. There was a big backyard patio with plenty of tables to sit in. Both times I went it was on a weekday and pretty quiet, but I did drive by a 3rd time on a weekend afternoon and saw a huge line and decided against another sundae on my trip. The service is so-so but to be honest, you just get your ice cream and go so it's not like you're really interacting with the people behind the window for more than 2 minutes. The ice cream is good enough that I personally wasn't too worried about the frostiness of the cashier.",

The ice cream is yummy, and their blizzards are wonderful (lots of mix-ins). The food is cheap and good. We got a chicken sandwich and a meatball sub. It's not the same caliber of food you'll get at Shiloh Grill or Summit, but it's also not even close to the same price. The seating in the back is fine. I don't know why anyone would be mad that there isn't a \"view\" because the shop is too far down Shiloh to have any sort of view of the city.  The owner, who many have critiqued, is good. He's not the kind of man who is going to smile at you and chat for 10 minutes and talk to your kids, but I've frequented his shop here and his coffee shop, and he's always been friendly, quick, and very competent. So if you want Mr Rogers, then pop that into your VHS. Otherwise, just be okay with a guy who's doing his job well and getting you yummy ice cream.  In conclusion, this place is fun and a great place to get ice cream on the Mount!",

Here's the thing,before you start ringing the bell,you gotta make sure that you know what to order or you'll get the impression that you are bothering the owner. She ordered a chocolate ice cream in a chocolate cone,few licks and it was dripping all over her little hand. I ordered a banana split delite,I think it was good and huge too maybe good for 2 person,I paid with cash cos they don't take cards and asked for napkins. Then the owner after handed me the change shut the windows in my face without saying a word. The service is very bad. I gave 2 stars because of the location.",

Don't even waste your time or money. $3.50 for 1 small scoop of freezer burned Deans ice cream that I could have purchased at the grocery store. And getting two scoops doesn't help they simply charge double, forget the fact you already have the bowl and spoon. They didn't even have the store front open you had to walk to the side and wait for them to hand it out a small window. They only accept cash but willing to let you use their ATM to get cash for an additional fee. What a scam- surprised they aren't ashamed to show their faces. I'm ashamed to admit that I gave them my money. The only reason I'm leaving 1 star is you can't rate negative or zero.",

Walked up to the window and ordered a simple, strawberry sundae with twist ice cream. The man working was clearly miserable. He looked as if he was annoyed to wait on me. One of my friends ordered a cyclone with cookie dough and the man actually told him that he \"hates making those\" and could have made \"10 ice cream cones\" for the time it took to make his one item. Who says that to a paying customer? None of us could believe how miserable this guy is. I wish this place wasn't as popular, because they don't deserve it. Terrible customer service, mediocre ice cream and high prices. I believe they are still open only because there really aren't any competitors near them.   Overall- Skip this place and go down the hill to South Side for some ice cream.",

The owner who is often at the window is not a very pleasant man. He always seems miserable and can be rather rude. I once asked about a certain flavor and he just looked at me! No response at all! Another time my friend ordered a cone with sprinkles and we watched him drop it in the sprinkles, pick it back up, put it on the cone and give her the sloppy mess that it was! He couldn't even give her a new cone. I would only give 1 star but added another because I recently did have a good experience here with the lady working. They do have a little patio in the back with plenty of tables to use.

Guy through the side walk up 'window' was extremely rude and seemed very putout to have to take our order. Ice cream was the same as we could of had purchased anywhere (vanilla cone, twist cone and candy bar mashup cone). Hubby like his candy bar mash up, only reason this place even got a star... Do not bother going here, over priced average ice cream served by a very rude man",

If we went by just taste, this would be 4*s.  There are two knocks on this place.  First, a small one, it is cash only.  There's an ATM nearby, but the year is 2017 and this place doesn't have any direct competition.  Even a \"minimum charge\" would be better than being cash only.  The bigger knock, there's a particular employee that's less than friendly.  To the point of being downright rude to some.  It's not like \"mean,\" it's mostly just a rather \"impatient\" approach to his customer service style.  Cranky.  He just was cranky.  And I wasn't the only one that felt that way.  At the end of the day, this place is IT in the area outside of Shiloh's across the street and they're not even direct competitors.",

Not sure what brand,  Asked for a cone and the grouch did not ask what type of cone just gave us waffle cones.  We sat on the patio in the back that did not have any lights at all, probably should put in a few low watt lights so you can see where you are walking.  It must be nice to be able to have a business survive due to location not because of good service and product! Next time we will go elsewhere for our ice cream.

After giving us our ice cream (4 single scoops $13 way over priced) she said if we were cold to go into the coffee shop and let them know she sent us to sit. Unbelievable! She has a sitting area inside her ice cream shop. Besides that bizarre experience the ice cream was mediocre at best. No specialty flavors.",

I'm not the type to wait while my child stammers out his order and changes his mind, I'm probably more impatient than anyone when it comes to getting ice cream in my hand. There was also no one behind us and it was just bizarre to be that rude.   We then made the mistake of asking if there was somewhere to sit which was a little cooler than the 90 degrees we were standing in and a guy popped up from behind the counter and told us to go across the street to the bar because they happily accept anyone who buys food from another place.

Though, I was a tourist for the day in a not so touristy town. Also, I LOVE ice cream and there aren't that many places to go to up here. Kind of a cute mom and pop shop. You can tell its been around for ages. At least since my sister was in college. ha.   They only have 4 or 5 soft serve flavors and then a few scoop ice creams. I settled for a mix of chocolate/vanilla because the only other flavors were apple pie and French vanilla bean and neither jumped out at me. My sister got Moose tracks ice cream. Much more decadent. She also made sure to slather on some cherry sauce because she's weird like that. Though, the combination of her concoction actually was pretty great and tasted like a cherry Garcia sundae with peanut butter cups. Crazy. My small waffle cone was about 8 times the size I expected for its value and I appreciate it. There's no where to sit really inside so take your cones to go and enjoy that fresh Mountain air!",

I pointed out that all 3 flavors that the girls wanted were on the board and then he stuck his head out and saw then and took them down and said \"and now they are not\"!  I don't know if he was trying to be funny but it came off as very rude. I would have walked away then but I promised my visiting family ice cream and unlike this store I am a man of my word. I was very frustrated but I wanted to put this all behind me. But wait there is more! I was given the wrong change back when I paid! They are cash only and I only had 20 bucks so my father gave me another 20 so I could pay for it all. I was given the change back for 30 dollars and not 40. I refused to leave the window because the man said I gave him 30 when 3 people knew I gave him 40 dollars. I was given the rest of my change and told \"take it\".

    "text": "Delicious ice cream, but rude service! The website said they closed at 11pm so we got there around 9:50pm expecting it to be open for another hour. When we got there we saw it was cash only and asked the woman at the cashier where the closest ATM is, she gave us a very rude response and blew us off. The other man there told us where the nearest ATM is which is where we went to withdraw cash. The ice cream was very good--slightly overpriced in my opinion though.",

    "text": "I was actually on my way home to grab some ice cream out of the freezer when I saw this place. The sign on the door said to go around to the side to order. Cash only. That's never a problem with me but they do have an ATM close by if you need it.  Since it was hot there was a line but it move fairly quickly. Most of the ice cream they serve is soft serve but they carry Dean's ice cream if you prefer the traditional. I knew there would be no way I could sample anything since people were behind me but I was blown away by the price. $3.50 for one scoop? Two would have run me over $6.00!   Mind you, I am willing to spend if I find what I am buying worthwhile but this wasn't the case here. I ordered one scoop of mint chocolate chip in a cup. It tasted just like ice cream you would get out of a grocery store. They have covered seating in the back to help protect you from the sun.  They sell food here and your usual ice cream flair but it seems to be the only one here in Mt. Washington. Since I was in the area on other business I had already paid my metered parking but I definitely would not go out of the way for this place when there are so many others that serve better quality. Too expensive for meh ice cream.",

Because he's a kid. The man at the counter gives him a bunch of shit for \"being the first kid in the world to not like malt.\" He lectured him that \"he didn't like spinach when he was a kid but now he could eat a pound of it.\"   When they order a replacement drink, they ring him up again, rather than act like any normal restaurant would in this instance and comp the patron with a replacement. The father asks, \"Seriously...?\" to which the response from behind the counter was to tell the father and son to leave without anything.  So they left. And I followed right behind them without ordering.",

Customers aren't allowed to see the flavors before purchasing. Any and all questions are fielded with caustic dismissal and condescension from the rudest employee I've yet to encounter. I left feeling bitter and worse off for having come.",

We walked up to the window and gave this guy a friendly greeting, \"Hi, how are you?\" and he just looked at us. Uh...ok. whatever. So my brother ordered a vanilla cone with sprinkles. This guy never asked what kind of cone, just disappeared and came back with a cake cone. My  brother had wanted a waffle cone. Ok, no biggie. Instead of making a big deal, I just said I'll eat the cake cone, and he got him his waffle cone. $10.50. wtf?? I live in LA, and even I think that is ridiculous. But whatever.  So we go to leave, and my brother (ever the polite teenager) said, \"Have a nice day!\" And again, this miserable fuck just looks at us.   Get some social and customer service skills, prick.

I unfortunately have been to this location on more than one occasion due to out of town guests all wanting an ice cream cone and not listening to my warnings. Every time we leave, we talk about how rude the counter staff is. The last time one I was there, one of the people in our party (not me I will not give this establishment $.01 of my money) asked for vanilla ice cream cone. They received a dish. When they let the server know that they had asked for a cone the server refused to fix the order due to them being \"too busy\". The solution was an empty cone shoved at the person in our party through the window. They were told to place the cone on-top of the ice cream in the dish.   Seriously... Lets be real. We are ordering ice cream hear not dealing with a life or death situation if they had taken the time to correct the error maybe, I would have seen that each time I had been there previously was maybe a bad day. Instead, they went on to prove that the staff/ ownership doesn't care what the experience is like as long as they are raking in your $$$.   Stay away folks. There are more reviews below that will tell similar stories.   To the owners,   If you read this post. Please do something about your service.",
