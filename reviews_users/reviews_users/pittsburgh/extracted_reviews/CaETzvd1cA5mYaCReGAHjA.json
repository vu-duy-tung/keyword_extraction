But when our food came, it didn't live up to the hype of the menu. The bread on my sandwich was stale, and his Reuben was extra greasy.  Granted, we are pretty late at night and had already imbibed enough that any food was ok in the moment. But the next morning we both agreed we had been disappointed.",

    "text": "After experiencing what non-chain real Irish pubs are like (Pipers, Harp and Fiddle, Flannery's and PJ McIntyre's in Cleveland), I cannot support a \"chain\"... kind of how I was never a fan of Fado in the past.   My most recent experience here was for a party for a Christening.  The food was bland in general, and their chips just are missing something.  If you are an Irish Pub, you would think Fish and Chips was something that would be gotten \"right\"... not here.  The menu changes like people change their underwear too.  I think every time I have been here it has been very different.     The only thing I think that is a plus about this place is Tuesday pint night... cannot go wrong at 2.50 (but I do not drink beer much so this is hardly a draw), and the patio in the warmer months.",

We ordered the cheese board, which was disappointing, of I'm being kind. It was to contain 4 cheeses. What it did contain was some blue cheese and 2 tiny scoops of what can best be described as cheese like food spread like one would find in a plastic tub in a Hickory Farms sampler. There was no sun-dried tomato spread. The baguette slices were dry and stale. It wasn't worth $2 let alone $15. The beef stew was atrocious. I have no idea how they managed to serve roast beef that was dry when it was swimming in burgundy sauce, but they did. I think the mashed potatoes were instant. And I don't know what those 2 dry points of bread really were, but they certainly weren't the Irish soda bread that they claimed it to be. If I could give this place zero stars, I would. We will never go back. And if you see this Natalie, you are better than this place. I hope you can find work somewhere else where you can serve real food and make a good living.",

    "text": "My husband enjoys drinking here every Tuesday night, so sometimes I join him. The $2.50 pints are an amazing deal. We've both had several drinks here plus an appetizer for under $25. The on tap beer selection is relatively good. Service at the bar is pretty fast, even when ordering a meal.  I've only eaten lunch here several times, and the service time has been descent. However, I have heard terrible stories from co-workers about how long it can take to eat, so I tend to steer clear for lunch.  Between lunch and dinner, I've ordered the Loaded Pub Chips, Goat Cheese Salad, Fish 'N Chips, and side of Mac & Cheese. The Goat Cheese Salad is delicious, and the Fish 'N Chips are very good. The Loaded Pub Chips are your average fare, and the Mac & Cheese is actually disappointingly tasteless.  I recommend going to Claddagh on Tuesday nights and for a good (but potentially long) lunch break during the week.",

    "text": "This was my second visit to Claddagh Irish Pub.  I was here the first time in 2010  for a work lunch, but I rarely go to the South Side Works, so I didn't consider this a destination location, but my brother wanted to eat here, so we met him for a late lunch on a Saturday.    It was relatively quiet when we got there, but this was a snowy weekend, so not many people were out and about.  We sat in the side and it was bright and sunny and the paintings of the two snakes on the ceiling and the other Celtic symbols painted on the walls, along with the eclectic knicknacks and books made the decor interesting and the atmosphere fun. It was a really great place to relax on a snowy Saturday afternoon and they had some drink specials on bloody marys and beer, so we enjoyed a few drinks along with our meal.  At our server's suggestion, we ordered the Guinness Beer Cheese & Pretzels as an appetizer, which were good, and my brother suggested that we share an order of the Scotch Eggs which were absolutely delicious!  I've never had them, but wow they were warm and crusty on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside!  We really enjoyed them.  Our server was really friendly and went out of his way to take good care of us.  For an entree, my boyfriend and I each ordered a different burger and split them - we got the Claddagh Burger which had fried egg, bacon and cheddar cheese and the Jameson Burger which had a Jameson Whiskey glaze, Guinness Beer cheese, and onion straws.  They were both juicy and delicious and so big that we were actually able to take some home even though we shared them.  My brother got the Shepherd's Pie and said that it was delicious as well.  The food was good, and I would definitely go back again to try some of their other signature menu items.  I was also really pleased by how much I enjoyed the atmosphere because when I was there the first time I remembered being in a very dark room with our work group and that was part of why I haven't been back because it just seemed \"gloomy\" at the time.  I was really happy with ourexperience and look forward to going to Claddagh again.",

We were originally on our way to Hofbrauhaus when my dad, who loves anything and everything Irish, spotted the claddagh and wanted to go inside. We sat at the bar and ordered some drinks. The bartender who helped us was very nice and answered all of our questions. We also put in an order for scotch eggs. Not long after we ordered them, they came out and were excellent. If you are going to the claddagh, I highly recommend ordering the scotch eggs.   However, about a week later I returned to the claddagh with a few friends to watch the women's World Cup game, and did not have that same great experience. My boyfriend and I ordered two different draft beers, but when they came out we were given two of the exact same, watered down beer. The waiter did offer to switch the beers when we were dissatisfied with them, which I appreciated. We decided to order some food. I ordered the Irish beef stew. I do not recommend that to anyone. It was very plain and did not have any carrots in it that the menu said it would, and I spent the whole night curled up in my bed with the worst stomachache. I will probably go back to the claddagh because it had a great atmosphere and the staff was friendly, but I will make sure to order bottled drinks and stick to the scotch eggs.",

    "text": "Claddagh fall into that category of a fledgling chain restaurant that simply hovers in average-dom.  I'll give them credit...their $2.50 pints of anything on draft on Tuesdays is unbeatable. You're talking $5 for two pints Guinness or Vanilla Java Porter! Not $5 plus tax, just $5...flat! With their solid selection of draft beers, it's a hard deal to pass up for happy hour (or any time, really, since the special lasts all day!).  My problem with Claddagh has always been the food. The fish & chips are decent, and the pub fries are awesome. I think Claddagh is the only place where I can taste that the fries are frozen, but they're still good somehow (yeah...it doesn't make sense to me, either). They also used to have an excellent balsamic vinaigrette. Seriously excellent. Unfortunately, over the years, I've just given up on the food and rarely eat there anymore, despite stopping in fairly regularly on my walk home from work.  A lot of the menu items that I have found somewhat enjoyable always disappeared, thanks to the ever-changing menu. Just once, I'd love to be able to go in and see the same menu last for a year or so. To me, it's just a sign that they're not confident in their product, and the experimentation isn't helping at all, as the food has never truly improved. It's consistently average, and hardly going to leave you wanting more (aside from the pub fries, that is). I used to like the bread pudding...but they even changed that...then seemingly changed back. I never ordered it again after the first change, though.  Unfortunately, the only consistent thing about Claddagh - aside from the $2.50 draft deal on Tuesdays that's lasted a long time - is the inconsistency of both the menu, quality, and service. I'll raise a pint, though, to the hope that the small chain gets itself together, as I like the idea of having an Irish pub in the neighborhood...I just want it to be a place worth going to for food.",

First off this place is slow. VERY SLOW. Our table of 4 was seated promptly and the server was nice, but she too was slow. The restaurant was fairly empty for 5pm on a Sunday, yet it still took 35 minutes for our one order appetizer of soft pretzels to come out. Dinner was another 30 minutes. Not one of us like our meal and we are not food snobs. The girls only ate a few bites and decided to pass when the server asked if we needed a box. I only ate half of mine as well.   We ended up here because the wait at the place next door was over an hour. With the awful food and the slow service, we should have stuck it out like the rest of the people next door decided to do. If it's not St. Patty's day, I would skip this place.",

Only one drink needed to come from the bar and it took 10 minutes (the place was empty) and tasted weak. Food arrived in stages because my husband's dish was delivered to another table by mistake. My friend's side did not arrive because the server had forgotten to ring it in. My husband loves fish and chips but reported theirs were \"meh.\" After delivering his meal late, the server did not come back and check on it until he'd finished. Even my kids didn't like the chicken tenders, which is unheard of. I ordered deviled eggs that looked like they'd been sitting out and a tossed salad that I asked to be removed from the bill since it had produce that was clearly past prime. Wrinkled tomatoes, one with a blue vein, and cucumbers that were limp. They did so without argument, which I appreciated. I am a former server so I am generally quite patient and understand things happen. But all of this in one visit really stunk.",

The side room where the party was set up was services by two waitresses that were very friendly and attentive.  When the meals started coming out the two waitresses were quite busy but seemed to stay on top of everything .  We were offered a menu with four choices and I chose a chicken dish that had cheese and broccoli with it.  The dish was a decent size but lacked some flavor.  It came with mashed potatoes that seemed to have a lot of garlic so if you do not like garlic be aware.  My husband got the shepherds pie which he seemed to really enjoy and a few others at our table had the fish and chips which was a large piece of fish that seemed to steal the show on that plate and I heard good things about it so maybe another time I would try that!",

Our server was friendly and very helpful with the questions we had about the food. I appreciated her honesty; she didn't say anything negative about any of the dishes Claddagh's offers but she definitely directed us to choices that she thought were more ideal.  We ended up getting the Pork Belly Tacos as our appetizer as well as the Gaelic Chicken, a Jameson Burger, and a Guinness Onion Soup.  Food was a little of a mixed bag. The onion soup lacked a lot of flavor. The pork belly tacos were DELICIOUS, it's a shame there's only three. My fiance loved his burger and although I didn't taste it it looked great. I did get a sample of the fries(chips) that come with it, scrumptious. My chicken, while I did enjoy it, did not come as described on the menu. The menu states \"pan seared chicken breasts on a bed of mashed potatoes with a rosemary whiskey-mushroom sauce, glazed carrots & parsnips.\" What I received was the chicken with the sauce, the mashed potatoes and carrots as scoops on the side, and no parsnips. The chicken/sauce was tasty. The mashed potatoes were standard but edible (it would have made a difference for them to be used as a bed as described where they could soak in that sauce). The carrots were the worst feature, under-cooked, basically raw.  We, however, found another big hit with the Fireside Cider (whiskey, hot cider, brown sugar, cinnamon). These. are. AMAZING.  Overall, we enjoyed the experience and will visit again.",

    "text": "I must say that it is quite a coincidence that when we were seated in the dining area that the televisions were showcasing the Florida VS Pittsburgh hockey game.  I had no idea the game was going to be on and it was definitely interesting -- a state against a city and the city winning!  This Irish Pub is located in Southside Works and is very new.  I had been wanting to stop by for some time and found -- after several failed, late night attempts -- the dining room was still serving.  The interior was rusticated (an engineered rustic feeling) and had several dining/gathering areas organized around the central, large bar with a private dining area in the rear.  Never having been to Ireland, I shan't vouch for its authenticity.  While there is exterior seating, I would not recommend in the winter -- it's frickin' cold!  Having seen the menu many times on previous attempts to eat here, I already knew what I wanted and ordered accordingly:  Boneless Wings (Hot/Piquant) Onion soup Bangers and mash Black Velveteen (1/2 cider and 1/2 beer) Coke  The wings and the soup came out rather quickly.  The French Onion soup was typical of what you might find at any other restaurant; but it tasted good and the onions were nice and tender.  The Boneless wings were a bit odd.  While they were slightly piquant, they were far from being buffalo.  It tasted more like a spicy honey-mustard-garlic sauce; with that being said, I really did enjoy the flavor of the boneless wings even though they were not what I was expecting.  While eating the wings and soup, my Black Velveteen arrived.  I have never had a cider mixed with a dark beer.  It was a tad odd at first, but I did find that I did like it.  As I nursed the large container of cider-beer, our bangers and mash arrived.  This was a large plate of food and I was happy that the plate was being split between two people.  Even splitting the dish, it was too much food.  The bangers are not the best I have ever tried, but they were still fairly decent and better than others I have had in Southside.    I cannot attest to the authenticity of the \"Irish-ness\" of this restaurant as I have never been to Ireland; what I do know is that I enjoyed what I ordered.",

The fish and chips had half the fish being awful chewy, the beef stew was authentic enough to be incredibly bland, and the darker beers we ordered tasted awful watery.  If you want strip-mall-irish, it might be the best Pittsburgh has to offer; we're thin on chains around here.  Fado does it better, if you've been to one of those.    Try Mullaney's in the Strip if you want more authentic Irish.  Hell, go down to Piper's British Pub and try the boxty.",

Once the place was crowded (probably because the wait to get into Hofbrauhaus was ridiculous) but last weekend it was relatively empty with groups of people scattered about.  Nice selection of beers though nothing that's super hard to find at another bar with a decent selection (had Harp, Strongbow, etc).  As a bitch, I get excited about their bitch drinks.  Great chocolate martini and buttercup,... of course pricey for the quantity that you get ($6 ish).  Buttercup was more worth its price though.  Had their spinach dip with pitas.  Tasty.  When you seat yourself on a Saturday night, sometimes the wait staff will notice you and come over.  Sometimes they don't.  Either way it's fine since we're ok with walking to the bar to order drinks.  This place tries hard to be Irish, with the Irish-style roadsigns and Guinness things on the walls.  After spending some solid hours at this place, I began to think that their music collection consists solely of Rock Band soundtracks, not that this is a bad thing but... some Irish songs once in a while would be interesting.  It also goes without being said that American sports are shown on the TVs but whatever.  The atmosphere is not as loud as that of a real Irish pub and is more like an American sports bar with an Irish theme.  This is actually a good place for drinking in peace rather than getting your Irish on.",

    "text": "So the bar here is just fine, and the atmosphere is not bad.  If you want anything even close to traditional Irish food, go to Piper's Pub down the street.  The food here is gross, and let's be honest, bars in Ireland do NOT have Irish Car bombs.  It's actually pretty offensive if you think about it.  My metric for a good Irish pub is that when somebody orders one, the bartender grimaces and grudgingly makes one up then hands it to you with a hint of a scowl.  It's too bad that they are pretty delicious.  But yeah, seriously, this place can go eat its own ass.",

    "text": "Went there with friends for my birthday. Checked in using No Wait, wait time said 15 to 20 mins, that turned into an hour at 10 minute intervals because they stopped seating temporarily \"because of the kitchen\", we were told. Finally got seated, drinks were served in plastic cups, one of which was cracked which poured water over my friend's phone as the waitress handed it across the table. Myself and another guest switched beer brands twice because they were arriving flat. My food came out at room temperature yet everyone else in our party came out hot. I sent it back to be reheated and it came back a few minutes later the exact same way and temperature that it went in. Needless to say I asked to have it taken off the bill and returned to the kitchen, now not wanting anything. They removed it from the bill yet no visit from the manager to apologize or check on other meals. It was such a huge disappointment since we've eaten there in the past and enjoyed it. Claddagh Irish Pub has gone downhill since, with them unable to handle a Saturday night crowd and unable to deliver on a pleasant experience. It was amateur at best and would not recommend from this point on.",

A healthy variety of beers on tap, True Irish fare on the dinner menu and even soccer on the televisions! I had the \"Full Irish Breakfast\" complete with banger sausage, black and white pudding and a fried tomato. It was heavenly and goes excellently with a frosty pint of Guinness. The wait staff was also extremely friendly and happy to bring a fresh beer over before the other was finished. They were quite busy that night but it was refreshing to see them on top of things. If you're in the mood for good food and great beer at a fair price, I recommend this place. I know I'll be back there next time I'm in town!",

    "text": "I typically try not to review chains, but we had such a silly experience here on Sunday.  We stopped by prior to seeing a movie.  I'm sure most of their business is due to the convenience of the location.  I've probably been here a dozen times and it's what you'd expect from a chain \"faux\" Irish pub.  The restaurant itself is actually quite attractive.  There are high ceilings, plenty of seating (tables, hi-tops and booths) and a good looking dark wood bar with plenty of brass scattered about.  The food is again what you'd expect...think whatever TG McFunsters comes to mind and then add a cabbage dish or too.  So, why the reason for me to review this chain?  We grab a seat at the bar and are greeted by a very nice young bartender.  I think her name is McKenzie.  I order a Guinness, since the place literally is like one big commercial for this storied brew.  I mean literally there is no where you can look including the ceiling without seeing some type of Guinness paraphernalia.  She sheepishly tells me they are out of Guinness.  It's clear she's embarrassed, however as shocking as this is I most likely wouldn't have taken the time to document this if for just that problem.  They are also out of Bass and Harp??  Okay, fine let's just order something to eat.  I get the fish sandwich (which was pretty good actually, especially the fries). Annie orders the \"loaded\" fries, but with only cheese and bacon on it.  She specifically asks for no tomatoes.  The first order comes up and McKenzie notices the tomatoes and doesn't even bring it to us.  Then they make the same mistake again and put tomatoes on the darn thing, this time McKenzie brings it over and basically says they can't seem to do this difficult task, so we skip the fries.  Finally, we are about to leave and I'm paying the bill when I notice they put someone else's' drinks' on my tab.  Okay, let's recap.  Irish pub out of Guinness, harp and bass.  They mess up a food order not once, but twice.  Finally, they overcharge me for someone else's drinks.  I still tipped the bartender 20%+, because clearly she was embarrassed and most of these mistakes were not her fault.  However, I think this place must be severely mismanaged.  Almost every experience that the back of the house was in charge of was poorly executed.  Hopefully, they'll get their act together.",

Took the waiter like 20 min to even come around the first time, we just asked to start with waters, took another 20 min to bring out the waters, and they used plastic cups... the food was not good, burgers were dry and the drinks were very watered down. It took us an hour from sitting down to actually receive food... we came on trivia night so I'm assuming it was busier than most nights, but as this is something that is expected and happens often you would think they would increase staff or try to prepare for it somehow? Also it was obvious no one cleaned the place as there were pieces of plastic packaging and chips all over the floor. I would personally recommend patronizing elsewhere...",

It seems that there are many VERY hard to please people in the world  First, the food was excellent.  I had the Mac and Cheese Shepherds Pie and it was both tasty and filling!  We were there on 2.50 beer night and that was excellent too.  My friends both had different dishes and each reported that theirs was great.  Second, the waiter was friendly and super helpful!  He answered all our questions and was, as he put it, \"brutally honest\" when it came to helping pick out an entre!  He kept us filled up and was always close by when we needed anything.  Third, the restuarant itself was very nice.  The whole \"Irish pub\" motif can be either over done or just not well done, not so here!  Even the music was very much Irish and I thought it was just right.    I was surprised at how empty the pub was on 2.50 pint night!  If you live in the area or are staying in the area, you should stop by here, on a Tuesday and enjoy yourself and the Shepherd's Pie!",

    "text": "I will never come back here if I don't have to.  I dined at Claddagh on a weeknight with a small group of friends to participate in one of their trivia nights - Disney Trivia. I found the event via Facebook. We were excited for the disney-themed drinks and to play trivia.  We were seated and our waitress came over. We asked about the disney-themed drinks and she told us they would start at 7:00 when trivia started. So we had about 20 minutes until then but then she walked away and didn't let me order a water for the meantime. What a sign of things to come.  Our waitress finally came back forty minutes later. We quickly ordered food (sensing she wouldn't be back for a while). We asked about the disney-themed drinks again (which were advertised on the facebook event page) and she said they aren't doing them anymore because it was too busy. It wasn't too busy- the restaurant wasn't even full. It wasn't like people were clammoring at the bar. The issue was that the restaurant was severely understaffed. I believe there were two waitresses, one bartender and the manager serving the entire restaurant that night. Still... how hard is it to just rename some of your regular drinks after disney things. Whatever. So we ordered regular drinks.  We got our food. Well, some of it. My friend didn't get his burger. My other friend and I both ordered the boneless wings which turned out to definitely be Tysons chicken poppers tossed in bbq sauce and were cold. We sat there nibbling at our pretty inedible food wishing we had a drink to chase it down with. Finally one of my friends got up to go to the bar to ask for some waters and a manager saw him standing and said he would bring drinks. He brought two waters for four of us.   We never saw the waitress again until we signaled to her that we wanted our checks. My friends all had drinks they'd gotten from the bar and she brought my \"that blue drink\" into our section on a tray. She wandered around to all the tables, got distracted, put the tray down and I stared at my drink for a good 15 minutes before I decided to just assume it was mine and get up, walk across the room and grab the drink.  Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant. Oh and tables were blatantly cheating the entire time at trivia so that added another layer of absolute disappointment to our night.",

It was basically a pot roast with no stew. It was good and she liked it, just not what she expected. The Irish mules are pretty good if you are interested. For dessert it was bread pudding.

We walked inside to find our server and get our  to-go burger and check. There were NO tables seated inside the restaurant! The other 3 tables that were seated outside were all finished eating, and it took 20 minutes for 1 burger?  An hour and a half for lunch on a weekday, with one meal having to be replaced and taken to go, is unacceptable.

    "text": "As a regular here for about 6 years, I recognize that Claddagh is very much a mixed bag.  On one hand, they have one of the absolute best beer specials in the city. On Tuesdays, they have $2.50 pints all day and post a great selection of local craft beer, and imported Irish ales, stouts, and ciders. I have taken the utmost advantage of this special for years, and even during the rest of the week, drink prices are reasonable. The indoor seating is plentiful and the decor allows the ambience to remain comfortable despite the number of tables. The bar is huge and has TVs regularly playing sports, including soccer, whenever they can. They have ample outdoor seating around two sides of the building and frequently have a fire pit glowing in the evenings. The bathrooms are regularly cleaned. On the other hand, pretty much everything else that makes a restaurant good, Claddagh does poorly. The food is mediocre at best, mostly sub-par, and always overpriced. The mac and cheese is basically a thick soup with generic flavor and the potato skins are bland, leathery and clearly frozen. The pub chips are decent, but \"loading\" them does little to justify their existence. I only recommend their Paddy Mac sandwich, only because it's basically impossible to screw up a Reuben.  The level of service is also inconsistent. Unfortunately, the servers don't stand much of a chance. The restaurant is often understaffed and the turnover rate seems to be high (even for a restaurant), so service can be slow and the staff is occasionally harried. On a few occasions, I have been forced to physically track down a staff member in order to be seated at a table or pay a bill. When servers were not rushed, however, my service has been quality.  So if you're in the mood for some Irish fare, dine elsewhere, but be sure to come for drinks afterwards and sit around the fire with friends!  TLDR: come for the great beer, leave for better food",

Across the street is the Hofbrau house. That's A-OK, too, but this review is about the Claddagh, so let's not get distracted. On the other hand, just outside the Claddagh is Cheese Cake Factory. That's A-OK, too. So in a nutshell, I am A-OK with the Claddagh. The most significant or most positive thing to say about the Claddagh is that they can certainly pour a proper pint of Guinness. Isn't that what it's all about? Cheers!",

    "text": "So I went to visit my friend for the week and I flew in from Florida on my last day there we went to go have lunch at the pub before my flight. As soon as we got in we waited 10 minutes to be seated there was no one there we were the first to arrive when we sat down. it was a while before he took our orders and I'm very understanding when it comes to restaurants because I work in one but the waiters attitude was ridiculous and unpleasant. Even my friend who is way too nice was upset with our visit. As soon as we sat down he asked us for our drinks without stopping and walked away as we were telling him. Once we got our drinks he walked away and didn't even ask if were ready until another family came in. he came back to serve them and the attitude was completely different with them. After he got their drink order and food order he came back for our order there was only us and that family of 5 in the pub. When I asked which plate would be better the meat platter or cheese platter he answered saying it depends on what you like very smug like and uninterested in attempting to have a pleasant mood. Obviously the decision is based on what I liked but I was asking which one sells more. On that note I do not recommend the meat platter it's just three whole sausages sliced up that you could get from Walmart and dried up cranberries with four slice of green apple and dill pickles with spicy Dijon mustard and a nasty marinara based sauce. Another thing we found annoying is that we had no drink menue we attempted to get the servers attention 4 times before giving up that we just ate and left. We didn't even get a refill until we were ready to leave so we didn't even drink it, we also didn't even get to take our to go orders because we were extremely upset and he never asked or bothered to stay to see if we needed anything. I had to get the hostess to grab him for the check because we waited 20 minutes for it. Their food menu isn't the best either there's not really anything there besides like 5 Irish dishes and the rest burgers. I couldn't tell you what their drinks are because we didn't get the menus for that. If you do decide to go I would suggest maybe happy hour or when they have events because maybe then you might have a nice atmosphere. Also when we walked in we met one of the cooks who was nice and friendly and the lady hostess was also sweet we only saw 3 people when we walked in. We would of preferred to get the others service then that waiter. I'm a straightforward person so I understand if you just want serve and get out because I don't like associating with anyone more than I have to at my job either but at least have the common curtesy to be professional and do the job properly instead of just being straight up rude.",

Pear and blue cheese flatbread with tomato jelly and arugula. The tomato jelly tasted like super sweet spaghetti sauce and was laid on thick. A few crumbs of blue cheese, a couple pieces of walnuts, three little slices of old pear slices topped with dried out greens couldn't compete with the sweet spaghetti sauce. I would've spit it into my napkin but those didn't arrive till awhile later. It was just such a lazy concoction there was no way we were gonna order anything else. Not even the bread pudding. Good thing you can't fuck up a Guinness.",

It alone is worth coming here.  The Irish music playing also added greatly as did the driver's caps the male wait staff were wearing.  (The only detraction were the Steelers jerseys some waitstaff were wearing.  I know it's game day, and I'm a fan too, but what a clash.)  I got a Jameson and my companion got a moscow mule (two, actually) and they were great and mellowed us right out.  So nice   The only disappointment was with the Monte Cristo.  I've had this before numerous times in Southern California and was really looking forward to it. I was expecting a ham & turkey sandwich pan fried the way you prepare French toast.  Not so here.  This thing was deep fried.  It felt and tasted like I was eating a donut.  Not good, and I probably absorbed a lot of oil.   So I give them a four because it's a great place - just don't get the Monte Cristo - unless of course you like donuts for lunch!",

    "text": "Staying nearby and hungry so didn't want to wait long.  So I wasn't expecting too much since This was about the only restaurant with immediate seating available.  We had probably one of worst seats in the place -on people's walkway to the bathrooms and next to the kitchen area and to side where we couldn't quite see any of the TVs which were tuned to the Hockey playoffs.  As I said though we were hungry so didn't quibble .  My husband had a draft and I asked for water since I'm a Diet Coke fan and Pepsi just doesn't cut it.  ( strike 2 lol) .  I was happy that they hadn't added lemon to the water without my requesting it.   I ordered a cup of New England clam chowder -- strangely the orangest New England style I've ever seen .  It had far more celery and onions than potatoes or clams .  Worse - it was extremely salty -and I am no stranger to the salt shaker!  The accompanying bread only slightly lessened the tAste and I drank half my water right away despite ingesting less than half the cup - my husband did finish it for me and agreed with my opinion even though he is more of a salt fan than I am.  He pronounced his monte cristo sandwich pretty good ( which is why this gets any stars at all) and it was accompanied by tasty steak fries .  I had fish tacos and I must admit that a friend asked me - what were you thinking getting that at an Irish pub ?- but I figure you shouldn't have something on menu if you can't make it well.  AnywAy - the fish tacos were pretty much tasteless and the fish was slightly undercooked although there was a good amount of cod on the three tacos.  Interestingly considering my soup review -it didn't even taste like there was any salt on them -much less any other seasoning .  I had my fish grilled not fried and there was no sign of a seared edge, they were served with cabbage , salsa (? Just seemed like rAw tomato ) , avocado ( a good amount ) and a \"cilantro cream\" which was pretty tasteless -- I only even took a bite of the second taco to see if it had any flavor at all.  Pretty much I filled up on my hubby's fries .   Our waiter seemed very friendly when he brought the check but otherwise never inquired as to our enjoyment of our meal -- id definitely have shared my opinion and perhaps picked something else if opportunity had been given but he only returned after we were finished so there was no making it right .  Next time I'd wait in line at one of the other places -- or just eat something from the hotel quick shop even .  A bag of chips and a snickers would have been more satisfying and much cheaper .",

This is a great bargain and I decided to come here to see if they still have this offer. As of November 2017, the drafts are still $2.50 on Tuesdays during happy hour. They have a fairly decent draft list, not a lot of unusual craft beers, but they did have Bell's Two Hearted Ale, which is one of my all time favorites.    I also liked the decor. It's a nicely done with a lot of dark wood to make it feel like an Irish pub. On Tuesday in late November it was a little quiet in the bar. Service was fine.   I had the Jameson burger. The burger itself was fine with a decent Jameson sauce and the beef tasted char broiled. The steak fries that came with it, though, tasted a little stale. The burger was probably a third pound--it didn't look big enough for a half pound.   I would come here again if I'm in the area, especially on a Tuesday. The Yelp cash back is an added bonus.",

My family chose Claddagh for a birthday party and we were a large group, but the restaurant seems set up for such events with open spaces to connect long tables. The atmosphere was friendly and eclectic, what one would seek in an Irish theme pub. And our server was truly sweet and accommodating. The stars are for the food.  Never have I met a meatloaf I have not liked.(My father's do not cout.) Bob Evan's take out is better meatloaf! Tasteless, a sad color and dry with gravey gelled by a heat lamp, I was confused. Shouldn't a pub put more love into their comfort food? The choice of vegetables may have been my fault. They had a funky smell and a sour taste that made me, and my test subject brother, make faces. The mashed potatoes were a boring consolation. I pilfered fries for a meal.  When my uncle's steak was mostly gristle, my grandmother did not even finish her fish, and my brother asked for food on the way home I knew I was not the only one wondering what's up?",

The first time I visited I sat at the bar on a weeknight at about 830pm.  I found the bartender to be very inattentive and spent more time on her cell phone, and watching a reality show that was on the TV at the bar, rather than paying attention to customers at the Bar.   The second time I visited there were two ladies working the bar area and this was on a Friday at 2pm. There were two people at the bar including myself and both of these ladies were also having to seat people as they came into the restaurant, as well as run to the back to get food and bring it back to the front. Both ladies spent time laughing amongst each other rather than do simple things such as BRING a menu to the people at the bar, ask if you would like anything to drink... The basics!   For this being an \"Irish Bar w/real Irish Food\" it was very bland. I tried multiple \"Irish Dishes\" across my two visits here and each of them were very bland. The only thing that had any flavor was their \"Traditional Banoffee Pie\".   This would be an OK restaurant to sit down at enjoy some drinks, however due to the Customer Service I received on both visits, I can't recommend this establishment or return any further patronage to it.",

On to the food, the scotch eggs were on point and the mustard was good. We also ordered the corned beef and cabbage rolls which were delicious and we both devoured. She had the shepherds pie and said it was above average. I went all in with the Irish breakfast and a Guinness. We both loved the soda bread which is sweet and filling. The eggs I ordered (over easy) were spot on, the ham was good along with bangers. The mushrooms were simply amazing. I've never had white or black pudding (which as an Irish American is almost blasphemy) but always wanted to try it and found that I love it. The bartender who waited on us (we were the only table) was professional and really knew his beer and liquor. The only bad thing I can say is that they are missing a ceiling tile in the main area.

I ordered the fish tacos and they came out with rotten guacamole on top and fried fish (the menu doesn't specify the fish is fried and I've never had fried fish tacos so my bad for not asking if the fish was fresher).  They also took a really long time to bring out our food (we were basically the only ones in the place) and they messed up my order (they gave me their French fries even though my fish tacos comes with kettle chips).  My friend's father ordered a side of coleslaw and it came out practically frozen and not edible.  Pittsburgh has a lot of amazing food places, so don't waste your money here!!",

    "text": "Yeesh. Where to even begin.   My husband and I came here with four friends last night for Disney trivia night, and we will probably never go back. We got there early, our friends had gotten menus and waters for themselves, and we figured our waitress would be by in a moment once she saw we had arrived. After about fifteen minutes, she quickly walked past us saying she'd be with us shortly. Fifteen minutes after that, so a full half hour after we had sat down, she had still not even taken drink orders for us. I approached her as she was finishing up another table and very patiently and very kindly said, \"I'm really sorry, but we have been waiting for about a half hour to order.\" She interrupted me to say she'd be right there, and she followed me back to our table and just stood there. She did not say hello or \"what can I get for you?\" or \"sorry for the wait\".... Nothing. Just stood there staring at us with her pen on her paper waiting. So we ordered and asked for two more chairs for our two friends who had arrived. She said there were no more, so we asked neighboring tables ourselves and got them. After another 30 minutes, we got our cocktails and beers. My margarita had a bug in it. Of course our waitress never checked on us so I figured I'd never get a new drink if I waited for her to come back. I approached the bar and waited for a moment the bartender wasn't too busy. He was filling up two beers at the tap, which requires no concentration, so I again patiently and kindly asked for a new beverage whenever he had a free moment. He rolled his eyes at me, ignored me, and when I said again there was a bug in it and explained that my waitress never came back to our table so I couldn't ask her to bring it back, he simply yelled at me for approaching him while he was busy and walked away angrily. The two customers at the bar who I was standing between agreed that he had been extremely disrespectful. I walked away and just awkwardly stood beside my waitress at another table because that was the only way to get her attention. She was apologetic and got me a new drink. The new drink that came out was a totally different color and either a different drink entirely from what I ordered or he just spooned out the bug and dumped more colored flavor into the drink so I wouldn't expect anything. He was an ass to me, so I wouldn't be surprised if he just hadn't even made a new drink.   We each ordered one appetizer, and one friend ordered a burger. Chicken tenders, pretzels and beer cheese, and wings. That's all. I think it was around 9 before we got our food, and we ordered around 7:15. It was busy, but for that garbage food and not even real entrees? It should have been faster. Our pretzels were hard and way over-kneaded. The beer cheese did not have any of the promised Guinness flavor, and it had peppers in it, and really it tasted like Tostitos jarred queso from the grocery store, except slightly worse. Waiting two hours for that was extremely disappointing.   We never got water refills. She did check on us once after we got our food to see how it was, but that's it. Our empty plates and cups sat in front of us until 10:30 when we finally we able to leave. It took so long for her to bring us our checks, and even longer to run our cards through. One of my friends had to go up and ask another worker to help us out. After we finally found her to ask for our checks, during the ten minutes she took to print them, we were one of three tables left in the whole restaurant, her only table left, and she was laughing and talking to another worker the whole time. She got a $5 tip between the six of us for a bill around $75, and we all felt like we were being generous. I never tip that low because I respect servers and know it's their living, but I could give even the bare minimum 10% this time because she did not even do the bare minimum for us.   Now I know it was busy. I totally understand that. But I have been to busy restaurants before that were even more understaffed and our wait staff was always apologetic, kind, respectful, and able to do the bare minimum to get their job done. This was an absolute joke.",

In may sound odd but it was delicious. It was served with thousand island which also sounds odd but trust me, the flavors work well together. I absolutely loved it. I can easily see myself here grabbing that app and a beer.  For dinner, I ordered the Shepard's Pie Mac----  ground beef, lamb, peas with their delicious, creamy homemade mac on top (made with Wisconsin cheddar omg!!) I loved the entree.  My bf ordered the Award Winning Fish & chips. The piece of fish was huge and the fries were battered great.  Suprisingly our meals were so big & filling we each became over it quickly and switched halfway thru. I enjoyed the fish option. The Shepard's pie mac was good, but very filling due to the Wisconsin cheddar. I enjoyed the fish dinner.. Although the Cole slaw was dry.  Sam was our server. She did an amazing job at first but disappeared after our order was in. Hostess delivered our food and we didn't see our server until after our plates were cleared (after the plate switch of course Lol)   Def would have been a 4 star review if service was consistent the entire visit.  Resturaunt is roomy and played fun alternative music",

Once again the bar tender was very kind and attentive and the food was delicious.   We have been back to this restaurant 3 times with my mother in law and she has yet to try the food. Twice the servers looked over at the door but did not approach to seat. The third time we were seated but upon asking what was on draft, the rude waitress said \"Ill just get you a menu\" and proceeded to slam it down on our table. 15 minutes passed and she did not return even though she walked past our table. Finally we looked at each other and said \"next!\" We left and went across the street to another restaurant as we had done the 2 previous times that we were not seated. We have not been back since.",

Oh and they have live music what a find.   I can honestly say that I've been here a few times and it is a good place to go if you're just looking to kick back have a few and enjoy some snacks. I have tried a few of their food items and I will say that their French onion soup is probably one of my favorites. And I really did enjoy their balsamic dressing for some reason it was just so good on the salad. The song like is usually super simple but there's just had a taste to it I just tied the entire meal together. I know that might be giving dressing a little bit too much standing on the meal in general but I enjoyed it.  I've also tried their steak with mashed potatoes and greens on the side. The steak has always been cooked to perfection but I've always had to season the mashed potatoes once they get to the table. Not awful but I think the mashed potatoes could use just something extra.  And in the Summers you can sit on the patio with a little fire and still hear the music. It's a pretty nice place to stay grab a few and enjoy some friends.",

I got the pretzel appetizer, which was just fine but nothing special. If you're really in the mood for a pretzel, you should definitely just walk across the parking lot to Hofbrau.  It's a very pretty building, but they seated us in a back room and I think the waitress forgot about us a couple of times. No big deal-- we were just hanging out-- but the service wasn't anything particularly impressive.  I'd call this one average in just about every way.",

We both ordered shepherds pie and asked for the larger portion and it came in a tiny square and there was hardly any meat, carrots or peas but there was a hell of a lot of mashed potatoes...mine also looked as if it was microwaved...my buddy got the fish and chips and it wasn't nothing spectacular...also all the food was bland and we did not get our soda bread that was supposed to come with the meal...I would steer clear of this place it's pure garbage....",

The happy hour special was good: $4 drafts, $3.50 wells, $5 house wines and half off all appetizers.  It was pretty empty when we got there so we had a whole section to ourselves for a bit.  Our meals were good, a couple of people had their wing orders amiss but it was taken care of.  Although, their carrots and celery looked brown and dehydrated.  Our checks were also not quite correct which took some time to get corrected.  I think the wait staff could have come to our table a little more often. Overall, not bad if you need somewhere to go before a movie since it's right next door.",

Claddagh's is located in the South Side Works and is separated from the crazy that can be Carson Street. It sits across from Hofbrauhaus and makes for a great place to be in the summer. They have a large bar with a good selection of liquors and beers. The food menu is also great if you enjoy Irish pub food. We have had meals and apps here before, but frequent more for the laid back bar scene in the evenings. On most weekends, they have a DJ that plays a variety of music. The dance floor is small but we are usually the only ones on it anyway ;)  They also host various artists and events, specifically on St. Patrick's Day. They set up tents outside for live bands and have a plethora of beer to drink. In the warmer months, they have an outdoor patio and firepit you can sit around and enjoy the company of friends.

Went on a Saturday evening with a group of six for dinner, the question before we went was; How does this place seemingly manage to stay off the radar of the entire city, especially when you consider it's location and the success of its neighbors? That is no longer a question.  Let me tell you how: First and unforgivable for an \"Irish\" Pub. LEARN HOW TO POUR A PROPER GUINNESS!!!!!!!  Second, Worst Shepherds Pie ever!  Bland with small almost undetectable tiny pieces of vegetables, brown in color randomly scattered though browned flavorless ground beef, scooped into the bottom of a bowl with pale bland mashed potatoes thrown on top.  Small portion.  Third, the \"award winning\" Fish and Chips.  They don't say what award it won but my bet is, The most tasteless fish served with the poorest excuse for authentic chips...frozen, seasoned potato wedges.  French onion soup was filled with half cooked onion chunks, served with two small floating cheese covered bread pieces .  Obviously microwaved with no color.  They were out of soda bread, we got what they called Texas Toast.  I call it 4 slices of soft plain white bread cut in half and thrown on a plate.  Pretzels with cheese sauce, pretzels had that microwaved prefrozen flavor and texture with odd flavored cheese sauce. Guinness Stew tasted odd.  What did they do right?  They decor looked like an Irish Pub, and the Tullamore DEW.",

With invitations mailed and responses coming in, I contacted the restaurant to make final food selections. They said, \"Sorry, we're closing for kitchen renovations on your date\".  I was stunned as these arrangements were made in January and reconfirmed in March. They could have cared less that they stuck me. Could they have afforded me a courtesy call?  When I questioned them with admittedly some emotion in my voice, I was told not to use a \"tone\" and then was eventually hung up on.    We should have know we were dealing with amateurs when we did a test run visit just last weekend and were terribly disappointed.  When arriving last Saturday evening, the hostess explained they were short-handed and to try another area restaurant.  As we had come specifically to get a better feel for the food and service for our party, we stayed.  Sitting at the bar was our hope for best service.  We were so wrong, waited 30 minutes to get a drink and another full hour for the food which subpar at best.  The Bar Tender apologized over and over and offered to pick-up our food which was the right thing to do.  Before leaving however we confided in the Bar Tender with our concerns for  our upcoming party.  He reassured us we were in good hands that we saw them at their \"worst\".  That was not quite True, canceling on us without even a phone call was the worst.    Don't go, they don't deserve your hard earned money.",

Terrible service aside, the food made us physically ill with 30 minutes of consumption.  Got the chowder the first time and it was basically gray water with baby carrots and some canned clams.  Also got their \"world famous wings\" which were so terribly fried the little guys were basically petrified.  The sauces we're fine  My friend got the fish and chips which look decent coming out, but had zero flavor.  Just a big piece of breading with some bland white fish inside.   This time got sweet potato waffles fries that were cut thin and yet some had the consistency of congealed cornmeal.  Oh, and their awful \"wisconsin\" fried cheese curds, or rather overbreaded fried stones.  My friend legitimately thought he had chipped a tooth trying to make his way through a bite. Wisconsin should sue them for this travesty. I won't even get into the spinach and artichoke dip.  Such a classic example of a tv disaster dish. Mind boggling.  I wish this was all hyperbole, but truly all I can say is DO NOT GO HERE.  Especially, when there are so many better places around.",

I ordered the Shepard's pie, it was a square bowl filled with mostly all mash potatoes, very little of the meat, gravy and vegetables.  I've eaten Shepard's Pie at many Irish Pubs never did it have more mashed potatoes than meat.  Do yourself a favor pick another restaurant.  The Hofbrauhaus across the street is way better.",

    "text": "Stopped by there for a few drinks before work dinner; Tuesdays are $2.50 pnts, which was a great deal! We went back on Wednesday and the prices were a lot higher. So if it was a Tuesday, I'd definitely go. Any other day? Probably not.   We were there early and there weren't that many people there, but we went back later (yes, we hot the bar twice in one night!) and there were a LOT more people there. The bartender on Tuesday was great. He was friendly and kept us refilled. Most of the stars are for Tuesday and the great bartender, although the food was good!  Wednesday we went back for dinner; no beer specials, but instead the special was whiskey and wine; I like wine okay but wasn't impressed with what was on special, and I don't like whiskey. The food was pretty good. I had fried cheese curds, which didn't squeak to my disappointment. I though cheese curds were the squeaky ones? Maybe they fried the squeak out of them? My friend had corned beef and cabbage egg rolls . Both were good! The waitress was just meh.  She wasn't  as helpful or as quick to keep us refilled as the bartender the night before.  They had a fire in the fire pit outside which felt fantastic to this cold Texan. I was not ready for the cold up there!!  I would go here here again, and probably will be back next year when the next work meeting happens! Although only if it's a Tuesday!",

Guess what there was a $5 cover charge!   Needless to say we tried to get seats but they were full so we sat were ever we could find. Staff at the door wasn't very helpful, three of them standing there! Ordered their fish sandwich which was just OK ... about 15 little fries came along with it.  There is better fish at other places. No one at our table thought their food was that good.... Lots of places to go to on the Southside that have good food and better customer service and don't charge a cover charge.",

    "text": "Since I started working in South Side Works, I've been to Claddagh's many times.  Within the last year or two I've become a regular, showing up at least once a week.  First it was just a convenient place to go, but then I discovered that they have $2.50 drafts all day on Tuesday.  I don't know of a single place around that can beat that deal.  The food and service were hit and miss for a while, unless you sat at the bar, then it was usually top notch.  Recently they have fallen under new management, and he is doing great things with the place.    There are new items on the menu, I recommend the duck, cob salad, and the fried pickles.  Lunch service is drastically improving with some very good flat breads and much faster service for those of us who have to get back to work.  They offer many more craft beers on tap now, keeping more taps on rotation and replacing some more dated beers with much more trendy and in my opinion much better beers in general.  This is a great place to come to watch just about any sports game with TVs everywhere.  When its warm enough you can sit outside and they even have a very nice fire pit.  They have also recently started a pint club, with some awesome perks that I enjoy immensely and recommend asking about.  At first I wasn't sure about this place, but it is quickly becoming one of my favorite places on the South Side.",

    "text": "My brother band sister were booked to perform a three hour set tonight. I flew in from Florida with my fiance and we were excited to support them as a pre celebration for our bridal shower. We invited about 40 people to attend the show and about 25 of us were in attendance at around 8:30pm. The show started at 9 and was going well. In he middle of my sister's song, the manager came over and told my brother not to continue. He handed him a check and asked him to leave immediately. I went back to speak with the manager and he said \"this is not the type of music we want for an Irish pub\". They were booked specifically by a manager who he said was fired the day before. At this point, we had spent over $100 and had plans to stay the remainder of the evening. This was the most unprofessional and tacky thing I have ever experienced. Not to mention, it took 30 minutes for a server to come to us, and the food was completely sub-par for the price. We were still willing to stay and spend our money to support our family. This experience has put a damper on our weekend in Pittsburgh. It's not about the money. When someone is passionate about their craft, and good at their craft, it is crushing to be asked to stop in the middle of something you love. Again, unprofessional and tacky. We are all disappointed and the weekend that was supposed to be a celebration has to be salvaged because of this horrible experience.",

At least about the chicken tenders.  I have been to Claddagh twice now and still can't pronounce the name correctly (mispronouncing words is my thing). That doesn't matter since I can still get to the place whenever I feel a want to. The first time I visited was before a movie so we didn't stay long and the second was to celebrate one week straight of exercising. By drinking lots of beer. Also, Irish car bombs.  Both times I have ordered the chicken tenders app to split with my boyfriend. This is going to sound so ridiculous, but they are hands down the best chicken tenders I have ever had. I know - chicken tenders? Um, ok. No, seriously. Go order some from Claddagh. I'll wait. They are amazing. I don't know what they do to the breading, but it is finger-licking delicious!  Their beer selection on tap is pretty awesome as well. They have Killian's! Probably my favorite beer from college and still pretty high on my list. TV set up is great if you're sitting at the bar. Which I always am.  Service: stellar. The bartenders are funny, prompt, and delightful. I have no qualms about recommending this place.",

We were forced to talk to each other and hang out with only 1 drink (lol).   Yes, the service is SLOW.  Now, the food:   I ordered the black & blue  steak bites. Steak was a bit tough.  No, make that A LOT tough. If the steak had been cooked a little less, I would have enjoyed this dish more.  3 of my group disliked their drinks enough that they didn't even finish them.  My drink (the Swedish Fish drink) was not bad!    Another friend was served a drink in  a broken glass. A huge piece of the glass was missing from the top. Who knows where the broken off piece had gone.   Overall, though, the patio was nice. And while I expected quicker service - especially during happy hour - it was a nice place to not feel rushed & enjoy our drink.",

She went above and beyond her job duties. She was super friendly and very attentive.   I wanted to try a different drink and I had the Blackberry Lemon Drop. It was delicious (and sweet, so if that's not your thing, you may be disappointed). I loved it!  I ordered the meatloaf and it was very good. The veggies that came along with it were also good.   The mashed potatoes were cold. Not lukewarm, but cold. This really was disappointing and if they had been warmer, I probably would have given this place 4 stars instead of 3.  The place was lively and there were a lot of folks hanging out at the bar. It's a very large place; plenty of area for a lot of people.   I did go back & forth on what to give this restaurant overall. 3 or 4. Truthfully, I'd give it 3 1/2, but since I have to choose, I decided on 3 not based on the cold potatoes, but based on how strongly I felt that I would return. When I thought of it that way, I decided a 3 was more appropriate. While nothing was AWFUL, I just think there are better choices in Pittsburgh.",

I've noticed some reviews complaining about the fact it's a chain, but as far as I can see it doesn't pretend to be otherwise. It actually seems to draw more Irish people in than other so-called 'authentic' Irish pubs in Pittsburgh, but I'm likely to think that because I go in to watch the GAA, which always gets 'em in! (It's extremely difficult to find places in Pittsburgh that shows the GAA).  The staff are friendly for the most part (some are great, some are only OK), and the atmosphere is usually good. If you can get a seat at the bar, that's my favourite place to drink. The beer is actually a reasonable price too - I haven't been too shocked by price of anything I've had to drink there.  If you were in the area and in the mood for a drink, you could do a lot worse than this place.",

Even though it's a chain, I was surprised  that the food we ordered-which was only a couple of appetizers-was actually not bad for bar food. The bar was pretty crowded last night but we managed to secure two seats. It was irish night so any of the Irish beers,shots,etc. were specially priced. I chose a stella (not on special) and my boyfriend had a Satin Velveteen (I think that's what it is called at least-guiness and cider mixed). We started off with the corned beef and cabbage rolls-it's like a fried reuben in a wonton. I've had these at Dive before and the ones here were better. There was a thousand island like dressing on the plate as well. I also had a cup of the french onion soup. It was nice and hot at 9pm which was surprising a little bit. Not overly cheesy or salty and had nice flavors. My boyfriend had chicken fingers-they are hard to mess up and his plate was bare at the end so I am guessing they were up to his standards. Service was decent at the bar, friendly enough and quick. We will probably return in the future for drinks or apps.",

    "text": "We had some gift cards to Claddagh, and since they don't have this chain in Chi-City, we thought we'd better use it up before we skip town.  We rolled in on a Friday night at 6 pm and were seated right away.  Some live music began around 7 pm - you can check the website, they tell you who's playing.  It can get loud, so definitely check the schedule if noise bothers you (or alternately, if you love live music and what to know what to expect).  Our server was incredibly (possibly overly attentive), checking on us approximately every 5-10 minutes during our hourlong stay.  Taking drink orders, checking on how we liked our drinks, taking food orders, seeing how we liked our food, boxing up my food, checking on my boyfriend's food progress (I eat much more slowly than him), boxing up his food, etc.  She checked in a lot.  It actually got moderately annoying, but at least she didn't ignore us!  It's a hard balance to strike.  Anyhoo, we got beer/hard cider (Strongbow on tap FTW) and then I got the chicken pot pie with a side of green beans, and my boyfriend got the shepherd's pie with a side of mac 'n' cheese.  It should be noted that they do have a \"pie night\" during the week - I forget which night - where pie dinners are buy one get one free (or maybe not free, but only for $2 or something).  One of the many times our server stopped by was exclusively to tell us about this pie night.  So it's fixed in my memory.  If you like dinner pie - that is YOUR night.  The food was pretty \"okay\" across the board.  Generic/average versions of pub favorites.  It's always a bit of a letdown because the menu items sound so DELISH and then it's like \"this food is just pretty okay.\"  The pot pie was savory and hot with big pieces of chicken and veg, but it didn't have a crust - it had like...a crumbly topping.  Like a dessert.  Only it was a bread crumb/cheese topping.  Which was not my fave - I prefer a True crust on my pot pie.  Is it really a pie without a crust?  Deep thoughts.  Side of green beans was well cooked, but of course served in butter.  Definitely not worth $3, but all restaurant sides are overpriced.    My boyfriend's shepherd's pie was okay as well - it seemed to have ground beef in it instead of big beefy chunks, but it was savory, served VERY hot, and had the appropriate mashed potato top.  Both portions were a good amount of food for the price.  The mac 'n' cheese side came in a little cup.  The texture was rockin' (sooo creamy) but it was missing something in the flava department.  Like - they need to pick better cheese, or add salt, or paprika, or onion/garlic....or anything?  It was lacking.  Ahhhhh I feel so bad giving this 2 stars but I am becoming more cruel on Yelp these days!  What can I say?  I give something three stars when it's fine and I'd be happy to pop in again if I needed a meal.  2 stars is for places where I don't really feel the need to go back again...and Claddagh really is one of them.   The food is fine for a chain, but it's really subpar versions of amazing Irish dishes that should be slammin'.  I'm so mean.  Or am I just so honest?  Hitting you up with the truth, that's how I roll.  Meet me in Chicago and we'll go to a better Irish pub.  BUT for what it's worth, my boyfriend said he'd give it three stars instead of two, AND I think it'd be a fun place to have drinks at the bar and listen to music.  And maybe have an appetizer if you're drunk.  But I'd skip it for dinner!",

Our waiter was AWFUL, almost pathetic. It literally took my friend a half hour to get a single beer. I had enough and went to the bar and started ordering drinks. You snooze, you lose my friend;  (you're not getting any of my dough if you can't bring a beer over for a half hour, no matter how busy you are.)  I ordered a Reuben Patty Melt, which sounded pretty cool. After eating it, I was dumbfounded. The sandwich was miniature and only had corn beef and coleslaw on it? WTFFF!!! Give me something more please! Separate yourselves from the million other restaurants that serve Reuben sandwiches.   I left Claddagh's thinking, \"You call yourselves an Irish Pub??.\" If I was Irish, I would definitely feel bad that all the non-Irish people would come here thinking it of as traditional Irish pub.",
