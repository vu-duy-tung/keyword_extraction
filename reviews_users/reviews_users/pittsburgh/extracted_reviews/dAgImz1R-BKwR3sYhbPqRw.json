A bit small, but very clean with extremely friendly staff, fast service, and kitchen is visible from the tables.  Food was fresh; we tried the dumplings appetizer and I got pineapple fried rice with 6-heat. My wife had the shrimp pad Thai with 8- heat.  While delicious, the heat levels were a bit mild so don't be afraid to go 10 if you want it spicy!  We'll def go back - best Thai I've had so far in the South Hills!",

I am allergic to many things and often have to remove items from my order or ask for special instructions, and I have always been soo impressed with everything here and their welcoming happy faces.  Everytime I order something new, its my new favorite and just wows me more than the last dish.  If you don't like thai food, It doesn't matter. Go here anyways. You will love it. I have had thai food before, but not like this! It is the BEST. I have never been to a restaurant where I just wanted to compliment EVERYTHING but everything here is just amazing. The veggies are ALWAYS soo fresh. And the tofu is always cooked perfect.  The first time I went here, I ordered pad thai and did not know our orders came with soup. I tried the soup, and never forgot it lol. Whenever I order, I get an order of Vegetable tofu soup because it is literally the best thing I have ever had.  I am a vegetarian, but have tried many things here. I will HIGHLY recommend the Mango salad with Tofu, pad thai, fresh roll... and of course, the VEGETABLE TOFU SOUP!!",

I'm fond of the Pad Kee Mao and their Thai iced tee. But be warned: their food is on the spicy side. They use a 1-10 scale and I've found a 5 to be as spicy as a 10 at other restaurants. I've also sampled my friends 9 and found it to be about as hot as my 5. That's the only complaint I can make about their food.   Crazy would be a kind way of describing the atmosphere. It's just tiny and seats about 10 people at the most. In fact, 10 people would make that place feel uncomfortable. So don't plan on taking a large party.   Overall, it's a solid experience and their food is very good.",

Quaint, clean, with an open kitchen and friendly staff, this place has become a new lunch favorite.   Got the steamed dumplings and green curry with noodles on first visit. The curry was light and piping hot - we're talking *molten* hot, right out of the pot - so heads up. Was stuffed up with a cold, and so I ordered the curry with a spiciness of 7 on a 1-10 scale. Cleared my sinuses and then some! Second visit I got the basil chicken. Both dishes were light, spicy, and tasted fresh. Eager to go back for dinner.",

I ordered a 7 and it was good and hot!  The curry itself was watery, there were large chunks of eggplant and some weren't cooked through. (No one likes raw eggplant). The pounded flat chicken was very dry and bland. There were a few pieces of broccoli and some green beans.  The pad Thai was just boring, it needed some fresh green onions or something to liven it up. I so wanted this place to be good.",

The South Hills does not have many Thai options. I tried this restaurant on a whim because after a long work week on Friday night the last thing I want is for driving a far distance to cut into my wine drinking time. I purchased take out as I prefer to eat in the comfort of my own home where I can eat Thai food where I can enjoy a box of blackbox wine (for myself). I ordered the Pad See Ew tofu with extra vegetables and spring rolls. The spring rolls were fantastic however the Pad See Ew noodles were dry and it didn't appear to have much of the dark garlic soy sauce that I longed for. Perhaps it was subpar due to the fact that it was ordered an hour near closing (I don't feel like that's an excuse, trying to give them the benefit of the doubt).",

    "text": "I'm always curious to try new Thai restaurants, so I stopped in here recently for lunch.  The space is on the smaller side, but it doesn't feel cramped at all, it's clean, and the decor is lovely.  Everyone working there was friendly and very pleasant - I got the impression that they genuinely enjoyed what they were doing, which translated into the restaurant having a very welcoming feel to it.  I was feeling somewhat indecisive while I was there so I ordered two things - the green tea leaves salad (on special) and a mango curry.  I usually don't drink much green tea because it gets a bitter taste if it's steeped too long, but eating this reminded me of how nice the flavor of it is.  Actually, this is probably my new favorite way of having anything with green tea or green tea flavoring in it, ever.  I would have never thought of putting tea leaves on a salad to eat, but it's absolutely delicious.  The salad is a fairly sizeable portion - it contains greens, the green tea leaves, mixed nuts, tomatoes, carrots and lemon juice on top.  The greens were more iceburg lettuce than darker ones, but the addition of the tea leaves made it feel balanced.  I don't even really like nuts or tomatoes much, but they provided just the right amount of crunch and softness to the salad, respectively.  Since everything has lemon juice on it the salad itself doesn't appear quite firm - visually it's not the most exciting, but it tastes so wonderful.  The mango curry had slices of mango, green and red peppers, red curry powder, coconut milk and your choice of protein. I was expecting there to be a stronger mango flavor while biting into the slices of it.  The curry itself wasn't bad, but it didn't have much of a particular flavor overall to it, and it was a bit more liquid-y than curries I've had elsewhere.  I'm not sure if the thickness of them varies more in Thailand, but personally I prefer them to not be so thin.  As far as the spice level goes, I ordered a 4 - I can handle some spice but not an exorbitant amount, and this worked just fine for me.  Again, this was a decent curry, everything was well cooked and fresh, but I think I would have enjoyed it more had the liquid been thicker, with a bit more flavor. Since I enjoyed the other part of my order so much though, I would definitely come here again and try things other than their curries.  The price was slightly more than where I usually get Thai food from (in Bloomfield), but considering that the cost of living is a lot higher in Mt. Lebanon the price seems perfectly fine for the area.  The portion sizes were decent (I had plenty for leftovers!), so I was still pleased with the amount of food I received for the price.",

Each one is a rather large stuffed lettuce, cucumber and carrot roll cut into four large pieces each the size of a huge piece of sushi.   Pad Kee Mao, Thai Style Fried Rice, Pad Peanut Sauce.   For those of you who love Drunken Noodles, it's the Pad Kee (kie) Mao, which was absolutely delicious. Made of wide rice noodles, Savory without being too salty or oddly sweet, yet crunchy. I loved it, and would recommend it again!   One of the cons was this odd smell that came from near the back. Also, we had to call for the waitress after a while. Not too bad, though!!",

    "text": "I had a craving for Thai food on a Sunday afternoon and Thai Touch Kitchen was one of the only Thai restaurants open in my area.   My boyfriend and I decided to give it a try for lunch. On weekends all of their entrees are only available in the dinner size so my boyfriend and I decided to order two appetizers and share an entree.  For appetizers, we ordered the clear spring rolls which resembled Vietnamese Spring Rolls without meat and was accompanied with a small side of peanut dipping sauce. The spring rolls were surprisingly bland and tasted a lot like a romaine salad wrapped in rice paper. We saw a yummy looking picture on Yelp of the Tom Yum soup with shrimp and ordered that as our second appetizer. I could not eat the soup.. it tasted entirely too fishy for mine and my boyfriend's tastes. Big disappointment because it looked so appetizing.  For our appetizers we shared the green curry at a spice level of 7. I liked the concept of having a spice level but I quickly found out that only determined how many red pepper flakes they sprinkled over your dish. The green curry was very watery and no where near as thick as the curries that I am used to.   Definitely not the best Thai food I've eve had.",

Despite the slightly long wait on Mother's Day, the front of the house managed to keep me informed about my pick-up time while the chef delivered three entrees. The Pad Thai is at par with all the others Thai places within 10 miles - sweet, lacking in punch and any lively flavors. The green curry - at 3 heat - was flavored well. Not too salty, not too spicy, though a tad runny. A decent dollop of varied veggies made it a nice portion for 2. The Tofu Eggplant with basil was a nice, smoky surprise. It's usually salty and the eggplant over cooked. This one was well seasoned with copious bamboo shoots and bell peppers to round out the dish. This experience was a big improvement over my first two attempts as it relates to the food, and front of the house.",

I thought no big deal and asked the waiter for some Thai chili's to spice it up a little. After about 10 minutes had passed I asked him if he could please bring me the chili's for a second time. His response was that the chef was being \"A Dick\" and he was not going to let me have any chili's. I was astounded by the way he was describing the kitchen staff and I can not believe the lack of overall service from all party's. The food at Thai Touch also got progressively worse each time. I was embarrassed because we had spoken positively about Thai Touch to our guest and they did not like their dinner. This place should close and reopen under new management that actually cares about delivering higher quality service and care for what comes out of their kitchen.",

It has been difficult to find a truly tasty Thai restaurant nearby, so I was super excited to go be this place a try.  It's SUPER small inside - literally only has 3 tables, so I would DEFINITELY call ahead before planning to eat-in here. But for take out, you can't beat it! I did eat in for a week day lunch with a party of 4 and was able to be immediately seated. One person has a pork allergy and they were very accommodating to his needs. We all loved our food. Everything i tried was very flavorful and tasted like it was made with all fresh ingredients! I can be kind of a Thai-food snob, and I was thoroughly impressed with their food! My favorite dish I tried there was the curry. I will be returning soon for take out for sure!",

She spent the evening on her cellphone, which is pretty unprofessional and made us feel weird as we had to call her over a couple of times. The servers started to put up chairs 15 minutes to closing time. Guess they wanted to get home!

My favorites are any of their dishes with eggplant, as well as their salads. Drink-wise, I recommend the Thai iced tea, especially if you've never had one before. The portion sizes are fairly large too, and it's encouraged to share dishes with each other much like you do at a Chinese restaurant. Also, they'll ask you how spicy you'd like your food on a scale of 1-10;  I love spicy food and consider myself to have a slightly above average tolerance to spice, and I find 7 is my sweet spot for something that's hot but doesn't overpower the dish for me.",

I think I liked it but I let them put too much spice in it.  I should have gone with a 3 or maybe no spice at all. I went with 6 and that heat kept me from tasting the curry. I also got tofu and their tofu is the chewy type. I prefer a more creamy tofu. The dessert we tried was nicely sweet with pieces of pumpkin in it.  It's a bit of a dive inside but they've added a few items to jazz it up - like mismatched ceiling light fixtures.  They get a lot of take out business. Its a narrow space and sometimes the customers picking up were standing right at our table.  Parking is convenient - right next to them is a parking garage.",

    "text": "The online menu shows many options that are supposedly gluten free.  They do NOT cook these items as such and you have to specifically ask them to make it gluten free.  I received an item on the menu advertised as gluten free and it was slathered in soy sauce.  When I asked about this I was told that I must ask for them to make it gluten free.  Judging by the size of the establishment, I wouldn't trust that they could make the dishes gluten free without risk of cross contamination.      Do not put something as gluten free on your online menu, then turn around and make it with gluten containing ingredients, that's False advertisement and you are going to make someone with Celiacs very sick!  $40 for dinner down the drain.  I understand that it is my own responsibility to ask about these things up front, but don't advertise something that isn't what you describe it to be.  If you have a gluten allergy and/or Celiacs I would avoid this place.  There are other places in the area that will bend over backwards to ensure cross contamination doesn't affect your food.",

And also a good place to order take out and eat at home.  For appetizers I would definitely order the crispy spring rolls and samosa. For the entree my favorite is the pad cashew noodles. A lot of Thai restaurants had mostly the same dishes but this noodle dish I have not seen at any other Thai restaurants. I get it with only vegetables, no meat and they load it up with lots of veggies.  No complaints for Thai Touch Kitchen.",

I wasn't too worried, since this is pretty standard for most Thai places.  The curry had potatoes, carrots and cabbage.  The taste was good, but beware the spice.  I got a level one, which tasted more like a 3 or 4.  This is the only reason i gave 4 stars.  For dessert, i had the custard with sweet sticky rick.  Very good! I would order from here again.",

I don't carry cash so where does that leave me? Either paying a fee at an ATM or ordering more than I need/want. They used to take a card and then suddenly changed horses in mid-stream a few years ago. I haven't been back until recently for a business meeting. I was disappointed to find the policy still in place. The food is solid so I don't believe it is fair to ding them on that. I just beg them to understand that there are a whole bunch of us that just don't carry cash and we make decisions based on where we CAN PAY... I get the idea of saving 10 or 15 cents on a transaction, but since this policy has been put into place I stopped going. I used to go once or twice a week. If one does the math they have lost ~$1,400 from me along. That not including all the clients and friends I would bring. Please consider a credit card policy change.",

Also, had the Pad Kee Mao, which is stir fired noodles with napa, bell peppers, basil and some spicy garlic sauce.  TTK uses the 10 point scale for spiciness so ordered it a 5 and the employee said that is pretty spicy, and they were correct.  If it had been spicier, probably would not have been able to taste the meal over the spice.  So just be careful of how you order.  Over all a good meal.",

I didn't realize how small this place was but it provides some much needed diversity in the little strip of restaurants on Washington road in Mt. Lebanon.    I ordered the Tom Yum soup with chicken. The soup was really good. I ordered a spice level 8 on a 10 scale. It was spicy but still so good. The spring rolls are really good and the sauce it comes with was perfect. The green curry with chicken had a great flavor. I only wish they cooked the green beans a little more. My husband had the red curry noodles. So good! I should of got his. Next time I think I'll get the red curry. The flavor was perfect!",

The Thai Iced Coffee is strong and delicious! I'd skip the fresh spring rolls though, they just didn't do it for me with bell pepper in them and just a lot of iceberg lettuce.
