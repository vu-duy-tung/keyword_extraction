    "text": "Pros:  -great choice of sandwiches and cocktails.  -They don't have a huge beer selection, but a pretty good one, I like unique beer or micro/local and they had  a couple of good ones to choose from. -super friendly staff. -I had the special, pulled pork with an onion ring and my partner had the turkey sandwich which looked sooooo good, I had sandwich envy. We both enjoyed our sandwiches. -felt like a hometown bar, not a cliche chain. Cons: -smelled funny when we first walked in -the steak fries were just ok (but I'm not really a fan of steak fries)   Summary: That's it, only two cons! I'd definitely go back. If I lived in blawnox I'd probably be a regular. Great for lunch or to meet friends for a drink.   Cheers!",

They make steamed burgers. I had ever tried one before, and I don't think you can find that technique at many restaurants in Pittsburgh. Overall, it is a low key bar with great, unique food and drink with competitive prices. Definitely check it out!",

Don't let the fact that there's no designated parking, entrance through only a small side door, or the small, divey inside deter you.. The people are friendly and the food is on point and that's what counts! The wings are some of the best we've had, and that's saying a lot. Honestly, if you're choosing a chain restaurant for wings over this place or somewhere similar, you need to reevaluate your choices.. those places have got NOTHING on a local establishment like this.  There aren't many tables in the dining/bar area, but I'm certain I saw a sign for patio seating while we were there.    If you're unsure, don't be.. trust me and your fellow yelpers and try this place out! You won't be sorry!",

The house chips are really flavorful and crunchy, highly recommend getting them. I tried the American burger (make sure to ask for the nox sauce on the side because it doesn't come with any sauce), and my husband had the lumberjack burger- both with no complaints. The staff was extremely friendly and the prices were comparable to other places, not too expensive. We ordered takeout, and I would definitely order from here again. I'm not sure how I've never heard of the steamed burger before, but I don't think I can go back to the regular old grilled burgers. Loved it!",

    "text": "We searched long and hard for the best wings in Pittsburgh, and we finally found them at Nox's Tavern! This is a hole-in-the-wall small establishment with a lot of heart and great food. We find ourselves here at least once a week! The kind and friendly waitresses are always quick and efficient, and one even brings over our drinks as soon as we sit down. They are the best waitresses around.   We always start our meal with a basket of their homemade chips, and they frequently come out piping hot. They are generously salted, and crispy after they have cooled. Since their wings are so good, we usually go for those. Wing night is on Mondays, but their prices are so reasonable that we get them on non-wing nights as well. I love the sea salt and cracked black pepper, which are dusted with oil and big chunks of pepper. My husband usually orders the spicy garlic Parmesan, which come with actual strips of Parmesan on top. He also loves the wet Cajun, and we occasionally share the dry Cajun. He has also had the hamburger, and enjoyed the fresh buns and generous toppings.   They have a nice outdoor patio that we frequented quite a lot this summer and September, but the inside is never usually too loud (except the one night when a live band was playing, which turned out to be a lot of fun!).  Last week, we ended up here on trivia night, and we had a great time and won $15 for a return visit. We will definitely be using it soon for more delicious wings!",

Turns out it was wing night (Monday) so the wings were 6 for $3 or something. Between us we split 12 wings (hot and wet cajun) and a jalapeno burger. Everything was amazing including the coleslaw. The only thing that slightly lacking was the thinly sliced celery. Make sure you order your blue cheese/ranch and celery separate bc it won't automatically come with your wings! Overall awesome experience. The service was fast and the woman behind the bar/serving us was friendly. The place was empty. I think there were 3 or 4 other customers who were also sitting at the bar.",

Their mild was good, but the butter mesquite was amazing, and it even won best exotic flavor.   The wings are crispy and delicious and that seasoning is so good.  Since then I've gotten take out a few times, always wings. I think we ordered some kind of appetizer before, but I don't remember what it was. They are really fast making their wings, even on Saturday evenings. It usually only takes around 15-20 minutes, and they include celery and ranch or blue cheese for no extra charge. It even took only 20-25 minutes when we ordered 96 wings, and they came out nice and hot, with a whole container of celery.  Nox's doesn't have as many flavors as some places, but the flavors they have are really good. My favorites are the Butter Mesquite and their honey cajun. The butter mesquite is seriously like nothing I've had anywhere else, so it's worth going for that.",

No matter what you order, the food is always tasty, it's plentiful, and you won't go away hungry.  If you love wings, you have to try out their award winning wings.  In the past three years, they have taken two, 1st place wins in the King of Wings contest in the exotic category, and this past year they took 1st place for the BBQ category for Steph's secret sauce. Their burgers are steamed, yes, steamed.  They are very flavorful, juicy, and you have a variety to choose from.  If you like appetizers, try their homemade egg rolls....and not the kind you get at a Chinese restaurant.  Theirs are filled with buffalo chicken, and the other is a ruben, which are a staple on their menu, but they always have an egg roll feature for the month, and you won't be sorry.  There are daily dining and drink specials as well, and drink specials during sporting events.  Try them out.",

The only way it would be better would be if they had an upgraded beef option, slightly bland most likely from a bulk beef package. Service is good, cleanliness is good, parking sucks:(, beer selection is solid for. 8 tap kind of place \" I'm tired of the 100 options some places have anymore keep it fresh!\"  All and all I think in a 20 mile radius it's the best burger you'll get.

They are the most moist and flavorful burgers I've ever had. They have seasonal specials every now and then, and around fall they have thanksgiving egg rolls. They are fantastic! I was apprehensive at first, but now I'm so sad they're not a year round menu staple. The staff is so nice and friendly, I feel so at home there. There are sufficient tables inside, but it does get full on weekends. Great daily specials as well! Can't recommend this place enough.",

It was their monthly special so it hasn't been on the menu since. The outside of the bar doesn't look like much, but when you walk inside, it's a whole different vibe. I love how to the bar lights up and all their chalkboard walls. Their monthly specials are always amazing. I like how extensive their menu is as well. Choosing what I want to eat is the hardest decision, but I have never been disappointed with what I got. This is the only place in the city that I'm craving 100% of the time.",

If you are looking for a really good burger that's just a little different, check this place out, you won't be disappointed.  This last trip they were a little busy and the service was iff just a little, but I stayed with 5 stars because our waitress was really hustling through a busy crowded time on a weekend evening.

I thought it was good although maybe a little too much on the cheese (I think that's what it was) but that's a personal preference. Service was fast and polite. It seemed small so I can imagine it getting a little crowded. Nox is interesting in that it looks like a house and could easily be passed by.  Everyone I was with loved the fries. Wings are also highly recommended.  They have house made chips, but everyone in my group opted for fries.  It's an interesting place to try out.",

    "text": "This Blawnox neighborhood bar and grill is what I wish our neighborhood bar and grill in Aspinwall was like.   This place doesn't look like much from the outside...it's located in what appears to be an old house. Inside it's a bit divey (dark and small), but it's very clean. They have a full bar and decent beer selection. They don't have a ton of beers on draft, but there's at least one of something for everyone, from cheap domestics to microbrews. It definitely draws more of a \"local\" crowd, which is not exactly my scene, but it nonetheless feels welcoming to everyone.  The food was what impressed me the most. They do bar food and they do it right! They have a variety of sandwiches (I've tried their chicken parm -- delish!), burgers (never had those, but apparently they are \"steamed\", which is a special tasty cooking method), and yummy appetizers. For example, their provolone sticks weren't just generic cheese sticks....they have a unique garlic butter flavor and were served with fresh shavings of parmesan cheese over the top! Another favorite app of mine is their buffalo chicken sliders. What sets their food apart, I think, is that they go above and beyond the usual bar fare protocol....you know... \"take this from a bag of frozen, put it in the fryer, and serve.\" Rather, they make a lot of their own food and it shows. Their food is exactly what I want in a neighborhood bar....indulgent, delicious, simple, and high quality.  The service was tremendous as well. Both times I was there, there was only one woman (one of the owners, I think) tending to the bar and all tables, and she was not only super friendly, but managed to juggle everything and provide excellent service.   This will definitely be a regular spot when I'm craving drinks and bar food. Well done, Nox!",
