    "text": "I guesses I've succumbed to the groupon curse, as I regularly get take out from this place and am usually pleased. The restaurant has taken a dive, too, in regard to quality of food, quantity of meat vs. veggie ratio in dishes. They are cheaping out because they can afford to. The 15238 zipcode ensures their continued success because wealthy SAHMs will be going to their private pilates class and leave the nanny with 80$ to get Chinese delivered. Everything is a la carte. I'm not sure its all made in-house anymore. Since new management several years ago, the food quality has drastically decreased and the MSG levels have increased. Miso soup is MSG soup with a tofu amount comparable to a baby aspirin. You may get two wontons in your quart of soup if you are lucky. General tsos, cheap chicken parts, incredibly spongy texture. Moo shu has plenty of cabbage, hardly any meat. The sushi is okay, but I've had some really salty fish, which makes me think its got some kind of preservative added on. We dined in recently, ordered GT and MSP, used my 15 for 30 groupon and still owed 15 for two Cokes and the tip... portions were small (I chalk this up to using the groupon).",

Beware of the delivery guy who will try to scam you for a bigger tip! I gave him $30 for the $24 order and asked for $2 back (which would give him a generous $4 tip in addition to the $2 \"deliver fee\"). He claimed he didn't have any one dollar bills. (Dude, you have ONE JOB! Hand me my order and cash me out!) Rather than stiff him, I gave him the entire $30 to keep...so my inedible meal cost $22 with an $8 tip! No one on my nursing unit will be eating from this place again, I threw out the menu and wrote a warning about this dive for the entire hospital to read. I just hope the bite of rotten shellfish I did eat doesn't make a return appearance later this evening!",

I pay $6 on campus and it tastes better. These prices are not for this restaurant. I have eaten Chinese elsewhere and paid more but my plate was way superior than Tai Pei's.

    "text": "Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .  I think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month, so I was sick of it. Plus I'd heard good things about TaiPei, so I thought I'd give it a whirl.  The service was abysmal - my waiter took 10 minutes to recognize I'd sat down. He was very kind, but only dropped my food off. No \"how's it going\", no water refills, no offer of dessert or other courses. A kind busboy kept refilling my drink.   The portions are extremely small - I've never seen such tiny sushi rolls in my life. The menu says there's a charge for fried rice instead of white. Huh. Jimmy Wan's offers white and brown, no extra charge. Interesting.  The atmosphere was atrocious.  A family in the table to my left and in front let their child (6 or 7, mind you) take off his shoes and walk around. He then ground his heel into the carpet - with a piece of chicken in between. He swiped a cloth napkin from an empty table and rubbed it all over his feet. I audibly gasped, but his obese mother couldn't hear me or ignored me. Then she threatened to take each of their Kindles away if they didn't shut up. The boy was eating with salad tongs instead of a fork all night long.  The waitstaff saw what was happening and didn't care at all. My waiter didn't show up after I was finished with my meal and when he did (after I'd requested someone else get him) he failed to clear my dirty plates. I finally told the owner how terrible the whole thing was - namely the ambiance and the service and she asked if I wanted anything to go and apologized for being busy. You...think I want something to go? How were 15 people in the 50 seat restaurant and one small takeout order. How....is that busy?  Other reviews have mentioned that the ownership has changed hands. If you care about your health, don't go to a restaurant where the waitstaff doesn't care if children grind chicken into the carpet. If they find that behavior outside of the kitchen normal, can you imagine what they do inside the kitchen? I have no doubt little handwashing goes on and much wiping of noses while cooking.  Jews, don't go here on Christmas, even if though they loudly advertise they're open. If 15 people means they're \"busy\", can you imagine what it'll be like on Christmas?  The slowness of the whole establishment is astounding. I dropped my little brother off at Jimmy Wan's immediately before going to TaiPei - a 15 second drive between establishments. Wan's parking lot was jam packed and he ate with 9 other friends. He called me to pick him up as I was paying the bill. How the hell did TaiPei take as long as Jimmy Wan's did to seat and serve and bill 10 people as they did me, the 15th person in their restaurant?  Only go here if you have a death wish or are a practicing masochist.",

He stood across the room with his mouth agape in shock, but with no concern about the comfort of his other patrons and their dining experience. It was a bizarre and uncomfortable experience, and follows a pattern of poor management decisions i have seen at tai pei recently.They know how to take in the money, but are less than concerned with anything else.",

    "text": "This was a nice surprise.  I really like sushi, but I don't like having to always drive into the city for decent sushi.  I recently discovered this place just a couple of miles from my house located in the suburbs.  I've tried it twice now.  The first time I was a little nervous about trying the sushi... again, due to its location.  Fox Chapel is better known for Starbucks rather than good ethnic food.  I had the curried chicken and the steamed dumplings.  These were both of good quality.  I thought the curry with the chicken lacked a little flavor, but I'm from the caribbean and used to west indian curry.  The dumplings were nice because they actually were light and not too heavy like they usually are.  I think probably the best chinese in town is the Sesame Inn with a few locations, but this place is fine.  What I am really impressed with is the Sushi.  I had lunch there today and was impressed with the servie and the chef.  The service was really good... maybe a little too much attention, but better that than the alternative.  The Chef seemed to be a trained sushi chef.  I'm guessing he learned his trade in Asia.  I had some excellent quality white tuna, which was delicious.  I also had the spicy scallop with avocado sushi.  It was really nice with great texture with the creaminess of the avocado and sushi and the crunchiness of something else (not sure  what).  I also had the crabmeat sushi, which was pretty good quality.  The rice had good flavor and the right amount of stickiness.  The sushi was wrapped perfectly.  The chef was helpful and very nice.  I would have preferred authentic wasabi instead of the pasty type stuff you get everywhere, but again that's pretty standard.  I didn't try any of the rolls.  I don't typically eat rolls, because they usually are pretty heavy and one of the reasons I eat sushi is to offset my typical gluttony.  However, the selection seemed really good and I was told by another customer at the sushi bar that the TAI PEI 101 Roll was great.  It should be with a $24 pricetag for a roll.  The ingredients are 7 oz. of lobster, eel, asparagus, onion, cucumber, and seaweed salad.  If this place were in the city I would probably just give it 3 stars, but the fact that it's in the burb's and has this good quality justifies the 4 stars.  And, they deliver!",

The rolls were not tightly wrapped and they were so large it took 3-4 bites for each one. It turned into a giant mess.  The Hawaiian chicken although the presentation was lovely it was so salty I could only manage a few bites.  The general tso chicken again had beautiful presentation but the sauce was was sticky and gooey; kind of a strange consistency.

When I opened the door the woman threw my food at me and told me never to order again as she called me TWICE with no answer (my fiance was upstairs sleeping with his phone, but our home is clearly marked and we've never had problems before). I handed her the money and told her I wasn't giving her a tip then and she LOST IT. I closed the door and she walked away. What in the actual heck? You guys lost a customer forever and I'll never recommend you to anyone. That was insanely rude.",

The chicken crispy and plentiful my only complaint about the good was the fried rice was a bit dry. I'll go back.",

    "text": "After receiving multiple recommendations for this place, I decided to give it a shot. But upon reading the recent negative reviews, I became nervous. They all had the common theme of: \"used to be great, went downhill, too expensive, try Jimmy Wan's.\" In spite of all that, I called ahead about 20 minutes prior to arrival on a Saturday night to get a table for 6, including two high chairs. We were seated promptly. The place wasn't packed but it was far from dead. Our drink orders were taken and fulfilled and refilled lickety split. We were somewhat indecisive about our entrees, but our appetizers got put in and brought out in a very well-timed fashion.   Between the four adults, we ordered two egg rolls, crab rangoon (6) and a vegetable roll. All were very good. The sushi was so good that we ordered another to share. In spite of ordering it last second, it still came out before our hot entrees, which were general tso's chicken and sesame beef. I rate both of these high. Chicken was crispy, not overly sweet or greasy with just a touch of spiciness. Sesame new was new to me but i had a bite and liked it  Prices were $13-$17 for the entrees. Some of the chef's specials could get pricey, but there are big ticket items at every sit down restaurant.   As for the service, it was courteous, prompt and, best of all, patient when it came to wrangling our hyperactive baby. The server was conscientious about keeping plates and other implements away from our grabby baby and didn't give us dirty looks for the puffs that littered the floor beneath his high chair (note: we tried to pick up as many as we could before we left). I think at our somewhat unfocused pace, we ended up being there for over an hour and we never felt rushed. Nor did we need to flag anyone down for service.  My only regret is that I didn't try something more adventurous. On my way to the bathroom, I noticed a hot pot, some dumpling soup, some kind of dish that sizzled like crazy as they brought it out and some sort of sweet, sort of rice wine-y smell that made me wish I had taken advantage of their liquor license.I also got a good glimpse at their sushi bar, which looked quite nice with all of the fresh fish on display.   At any rate, I would most definitely come back here. It deserves its $$ rating here, but it's no more expensive than going to China Palace in Shadyside (one of my favorites).",

Both times I ordered sushi, I was able to see it being prepared, which is always a plus. My waiter was quick and served me as soon as the sushi was ready. The second time I went, I ordered sushi and an entree. The service was good but took a while for my main dish to be served. I only mention this since the restaurant wasn't packed.  Still, the food was wonderfully prepared. I consider Tai Pei one of my favorite spots!",

Today, we wanted to see why this restaurant always looks like it's packed. Now we know. The service was impeccable, and we thought the restaurant was spotlessly clean. The food was spot on - from the shumai (tastes like it's made from scratch) to the Taipei Special Dumplings (which have a tasty thin exterior and a rich, savory pork filling), we enjoyed our appetizers very much.  The main dishes were equally as nice - we had the crispy shrimp and broccoli (lightly battered crispy shrimp and a great sweet chili garlic sauce) and at our waiter's suggestion, the basil rice noodles with chicken. I must say that the basil rice noodle dish was the best of the day; flavorful thin chicken slices with fresh basil tossed in with the delicious noodles and a little bit of sauce. The dish just works... Like other Chinese restaurants, the portions are large, and we probably should have only ordered one entree for the two of us after enjoying the two appetizers. Food was served at the correct temperature, too, which is something I always look for. (I hate it when food is too hot or too cold when it is served!)  There is room for improvement with regards to the actual menu - it's too big, and has too many items on too many pages, making it a bit difficult to make up ones' mind, but this is hardly unique to Taipei, and I would say 99% of Chinese restaurants have this problem...  Prices are reasonable, and overall, it was a nice Saturday lunch experience.  Will definitely be back.",

Mine needed a bit more sauce to make not as dry. But, our crab ragoons were fantastic.  I can't say much for service since this was take out, but the portion sizes are huge. This makes the prices a bit more bearable because you're getting a lunch and dinner out of the meal. I'm just not that excited for my lunch. There's not much left to say.

    "text": "I have been a regular customer and defender of Tai Pei restaurant (against the Jimmy Wan's converts- though I also enjoy Jimmy Wan's). Unfortunately, I must agree with Danielle P that the past few years I've seen a slow but substantial decline in quality. There always seems to be multiple managers on duty, which makes me wonder how there is such a lapse in quality control.   Selection: They have the usual American-Chinese restaurant fare plus sushi. It's a slightly more diverse selection with entrees like Chilean Sea Bass and daily specials.  Ordering: For the first time today, I used GrubHub to place my delivery lunch order online. I enjoyed this convenience. In the past, phone orders have also been pleasant and we've never had an order mix-up.  Delivery: Delivery times are consistently speedy. They always beat their estimate. Delivery drivers are friendly and bring the food in to our front desk instead of waiting inthe lot for us to come out as some drivers do.  Food: This is where the trouble starts. In general, the food has become much too greasy. Writing this 20 minutes after eating I can still feel the grease on my lips and there is a little oil on my keyboard, I confess! The Wonton soup is dark brown and way too salty (and I'm a salt addict) with nothing but broth and 2 wontons that are obviously not made in house.   Today I had the shredded pork with garlic sauce (lunch portion). It was a disaster. Besides the heavy oil content, it was also bland despite it being a 'spicy' offering. The worst part was the ratio of meat to water chestnuts. Probably 30% meat to 70% water chestnuts. Not kidding. maybe even 80/20. I am uploading a photo as proof. This is clearly a way to cut back on the amount of meat that they give you and I feel completely ripped off.",

And the portion size was big. Second was the Figu or Fugi roll with crab and tuna! The crab salad they served on the side was fantastic was our favorite thing of the meal! Most definitely would recommend the sushi as for the other dishes not sure of but everyone in the place was raving about their rolls...",

Comfortable environment, great service, and good food... the overall experience was an enjoyable one.  The scallion pancakes were the best that I have ever tried, and my chicken and broccoli was perfect (I know it is a basic dish, but to be honest, there are plenty of places that cannot seem to get it right).

    "text": "Some coworkers and I ordered lunch from Tai Pei many years ago, and I remember not being all that impressed. So despite living right down the road from this place, I haven't ever eaten here aside from that one time. However, Groupon can usually convince me to try just about anything (thanks Groupon!), so when I saw that I could grab some food here at a discount, I decided that it was high time to give this place another go.  And I'm really glad that I did! We came for dinner on a busy Saturday evening, and while it took awhile for someone to acknowledge us, once we were seated, we had very warm and friendly service from our waitress Rose. They begin each meal with complimentary wonton-type fried crisps served with homemade duck and spicy mustard sauce. I'm not a mustard fan, but my husband declared it the most delicious mustard he's ever had at a Chinese restaurant. For our meals, we ordered the chicken with broccoli and general tso's (their menu is largely geared toward the typical Americanized Chinese offerings, which I'm unabashedly a fan of....assuming they are executed well, of course). The food came out in short order and it was surprisingly delicious. The sauce in the broccoli chicken dish was flavorful and not overly oily, which a lot of sauces of this nature tend to be. The broccoli was fresh, plentiful, and cooked to a perfect texture. As for the general tso's, the chicken was crispy and high quality (no grisly, fatty, or otherwise questionable pieces of meat here). The general tso's sauce was fairly well-balanced...I would've liked a little more heat, but compared to most general's tso's sauces, it managed to avoid being overly sticky sweet and one-note.   The portions were generous....in fact, they are kind of in a gray area where one meal is almost too much for one person (unless you have a really big appetite), but it's not quite enough for two (unless you each want a light dinner). And that's my biggest complaint about Tai Pei....it feels a little overpriced for Chinese food because their prices reflect their larger portions (e.g., I think we paid $16 or $17 for the general tso's, which is much higher compared to similar restaurants). I wish they would offer their dinners in smaller sizes with corresponding lower prices. I don't need a quart of chicken with broccoli for dinner...why can't I order a pint like at other Chinese restaurants? And yes, I know you can obviously take leftovers home, but I think the food is best eaten fresh. Note that they do offer cheaper and smaller sizes for lunch, so my complaint here only applies to dinner.  So I'm taking one star off for the higher prices and lack of size options on their dinner menu. But other than that, this a great choice for this type of cuisine. I'll definitely be back. I periodically see a lot of coupons for this place floating around...Groupon, Clipper Magazine, and even on the back of Market District receipts. So if you want to save a few bucks, make sure you search around for a coupon before you go!",

The Sczechuan Beef is great because they have lots of celery in it.   This past Friday we ordered Seafood Hot & Sour Soup for Two.  It was amazing!  Each of us got 2+ bowls and the flavor was superb.  After my 2 bowls I wanted more.  We then got the Lettuce wraps with chicken.  First had them years ago at the new Dumpling House in Squirrel Hill and they were great!  Theirs were served cold in lettuce cups.  At Tai Pei theirs was served hot and it wasn't the same...after you make the mistake of \"assuming\"  the same results. My partner had a pork and shrimp entree which was supposed to come with the shrimp in a red pepper sauce.  Instead, it came in that day-glo sweet and sour sauce. I had Imperial beef.  The accompanying broccoli was nice and crisp  but the beef was in a very dark brown sauce and was extremely salty. The service is excellent, the staff is friendly and attentive to the diners needs but someone in the kitchen is heavy on the soy and salt. I'll still go back and try new things and hope that some favorites emerge from my choices.",

I have to say that having partaken of lots of Chinese food in the north hills, east end, and downtown, Taipei beats everything. The consistently great flavor of all the dishes is really remarkable. We just grabbed take-out here again and it was superb.  Our go-to's are usually the hot and sour soup (best in Pittsburgh-- with lots of tofu and pork and good texture and spice); pork dumplings; and lo mein.   We also have for years gotten their sesame chicken, which is really unusual. We like to call it \"donut chicken\"-- it has light breading and sweet and vinegary sauce. It's the best thing we've gotten there.  I've had their sushi in the past and it was very good too, especially their nigiri.  Overall, I'm glad to see Taipei maintain excellent quality for a number of years. Highly recommend this place.",

Second, the $10 shrimp bacon appetizer was little nuggets of maybe 1/4 of a shrimp wrapped in raw bacon, breaded and deep fried.  Came with a side of sauce that I highly suspect was mayonnaise mixed with sugar. Disgusting.  The orange beef ( first item on chef's suggestions menu, I believe) was 2\"X2\" squares of tough of meat that were so large it was impossible to eat with chop sticks. I suspect the cook was pressed for time and didn't bother to cut it up. The soggy breading on the orange beef added no flavor or texture and simply added filler empty calories that made me want to eat the meal even less.  Do yourself a favor and get a 3-day old tuna salad sandwich from the gas station for a more satisfying meal that likewise won't empty your wallet. I really want this local business to thrive in the sea of chain restaurants.  That said, they've got a lot of work to do.",

    "text": "Our office is always looking for a new place to get delivery from, as the options around the office park can be slim... so we decided to switch it up from our regular Chinese restaurant delivery and give Tai Pei a try.  I think we've found a new favorite!  The first thing I noticed was how polite the girl on the phone was when taking our large order. When I called back 30 minutes later because I forgot to tell her we had a coupon for a free appetizer, she didn't even hesitate and said she would take care of it and send them out with our order (that was going out the door within mere minutes!).  The food was fresh and hot when it arrived.  Everyone was pleased with their lunch entree selections and soups, and I was over the moon with my maki roll lunch special. I LOVE that I can select from a few different rolls instead of being locked in to a combination every time.  Lunch for 5 people:  4 lunch entrees with rice and soup and 1 sushi lunch (2 rolls) with soup, came to $57 which is an absolute deal in my book.  I think we'll be ordering from here again very, very soon!",

First of all it's a lot bigger inside than it looks from the outside and tables/booths are comfortably spaced so you don't feel crowded. The staff (from the host to Joe, our server, as well as the busboy) were all very friendly and our water glasses were never empty.  We arrived with 25 minutes left on the lunch specials which included a variety of sushi and Chinese dishes so we ordered the shrimp and scallop in Hunan sauce Chinese lunch special which included your choice of steamed or fried rice, an egg roll, and one of 3 soups (hot and sour, wonton and egg drop).  We also got a 2 roll sushi lunch special served with a miso soup.  It was a great deal for all the food we got.    I probably would not get the egg drop soup again - it had a strange 'corny' taste to it and lo and behold I discovered corn at the bottom of the bowl! First time I had it like that and was not my favorite.  Everything else we had was very good.  I know all the sushi purists don't think Philadelphia rolls are sushi but I am a sucker for anything with cream cheese in it so for the 2 roll sushi special we opted for the Philadelphia rolls and the spicy tuna rolls. Sometimes rolls have too much rice and not enough fish in the pieces but these were perfect! The spicy tuna rolls had the right amount of spice to make it flavorful and packed a spicy punch.  They also happened to have fresh uni that they just got in so we had to order.  I never had it served with a perfectly ripened slice of avocado underneath and wow did it blow me away. The combo of the creamy avocado and the earthy creamy taste of the uni were so perfect together I'd drive all this way just for another bite of this.   Would definitely be a regular customer if it was closer.",

Parking was a little tight on a Friday night, but I think that is just an intrinsic problem with their location.  I had General Tso's chicken - usually a good benchmark for any American Chinese spot. The sauce was a little less spicy than I prefer, but the odd thing was its consistency - very thick and syrup-like. I was also disappointed that no broccoli was included with the meal - just chicken and white rice for sixteen dollars. We had crab and cheese wontons as well and these were tasty.  It seems like this is a Fox Chapel mainstay, but I wasn't too thrilled with my overall meal. If I'm in the area again, I may drop by to try something else, but I'm not sure if it's worth the trip for me with other options nearby.",

    "text": "Has the won ton soup and the amazing chicken. The wonton was tasty but needed some vegetables.  I ordered the amazing chicken and added vegetables - they weren't generous with the veggies.  Tasty food.  But would do better with a little note attention. I would give it another star if they fixed these things.  I did like the ambience - casual but quaintly decorates.  Five minutes after I posted this - they came over and offered me more vegetables.  Great service! It's wonderful to have a great restaurant that cares about their customers.  Also - the amazing chicken was amazing.",
