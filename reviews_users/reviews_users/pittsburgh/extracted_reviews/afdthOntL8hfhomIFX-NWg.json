I did not order sushi, but got two types in the container I picked up. The curry chicken with onions, my favorite was just not tasty at all. The food came4 in a Styrofoam three section box with the chicken in the smallest portion and the two sushis in the others. it was very disappointing and also maddening- I did not order sushi! I will not go back and have found another Lawrenceville Chinese place instead.",

Their sushi rolls with salmon and tuna are pretty decent. However, stay away from their yellow tail/ whiter looking fish--least fresh looking sushi I have ever seen. They have really good bento box specials with large portions that make great leftovers. Delivery service is definitely efficient.",

Thankfully, before eating it, I cut some up for my 1 year old. This allowed me to see the raw/under cooked chicken! Both the sesame and general tso chicken. My California roll was HOT from being packaged with my meal. We decided to call gh and not risk eating anything. Zen's wound up calling us, and tried to tell us that they cut the chicken bigger than normal, and that's why it was under cooked. That may be, but from my time in the food industry, I know that everything leaving a kitchen should be temped before serving. Raw chicken can kill someone and shut down a business. They also told me that their California rolls were meant to be served hot.  What we did taste (some sauce, the egg roll, a bite of rice) was mediocre at best, so needless to say, our search for good Chinese in the Burgh continues.",

Delivery was much quicker than expected. The spring rolls and chicken egg roll were very nice (the fried items we ordered, in other words, were the best part). The chicken fried rice was fine, acceptable but nothing special. The sushi (I think it was crab and avocado) was mostly fine but the rice had a bit of an overcooked, sticky texture. The tempura-fried ice cream, as a delivered item, was kind of hopeless and mushy. I had requested no mushrooms, in writing, on the order, but there still were mushrooms in the cashew chicken, but thankfully none in the chicken lo mein. Both the chicken lo mein and the cashew chicken left a lot to be desired. Tons of murky, brown, salty sauce on both of those last two. Everything was edible but especially based on those last two items (the main-dish items), I can't say I was impressed. However they have good prices, so we might try them again.",

Apparently it is almost all take-out, because they did a lot of that.

Crab Rangoon was awesome and a nice size. California roll was one of the best and a big sized roll. 1st time getting Dragon & Phoenix and it was great shrimp was large as with the chicken. I highly recommend ordering from Zen!! Only complaint is they didn't include forks but I didn't ask so it kinda my fault.",

The first time, all my food was there (large egg drop, small wonton soup, edamame, fried rice, egg rolls), but one of the soup containers (small wonton) had broken in the bag. The delivery man told me that he would go get another one. I thought he was joking.  I ate my food, good portions, very tasty, and didn't think anything of it. The wonton soup was only a couple of dollars.  I get a phone call 30 minutes later, from the same deliver man, saying he had my soup. I couldn't believe it. And he refused an additional tip.  This place gets five stars for awesome service and really good food.",

    "text": "First off, we came home to a menu sticking from the door crack, skimmed through it and was instantly attracted to the free delivery service. The menu was extensive ranging from sushi to the typical chinese foods.  I noticed the nicely priced lunch menu for only $5.95. We ordered the sesame chicken which came with the 4 pieces of the california roll and the chicken with broccoli from the dinner menu which came with the 4 pieces of california roll and an egg roll.    I was satisfied with the quick delivery service, but the food was another story. Everything was overly sweet.  Especially the sesame chicken. It felt like I was eating packets full of sugar and msg. The california roll was okay...can't really mess up on a california roll.  But all in all, they need to revise their menu and make it simpler for customers to navigate.  I would not order from here again even if I fail to make dinner and it's the only place that offers delivery to my home....we'll see... :P",

    "text": "I would like to point out the spectacular service I received from this establishment... I recently made an order from Grubhub for delivery. After completing the order it was much to my dismay that this establishment was close to a half hour away from where I live. And there was a miscommunication from Grubhub that thought this establishment was close enough to me for delivery... However, after speaking with the manager of Zen Asian Diner, he felt so badly that we were unable to connect that he had his delivery driver travel the distance to deliver to me my order. I was not upset because the manager and I both agreed that an error had occurred in the location of the ordering process. I must give full props to the manager for going that extra mile to ensure that a customer was happy! The food was phenomenal! I enjoyed it greatly... I threw an extra tip in for the driver to show my gratitude. I hope it was worth your trip!!! But I am very satisfied with Zen Asian Garden and recommend it to anyone who enjoys great Asian food! Thank you for going that extra mile! It's rare to have an establishment go to the lengths this place did for me! So I will always have this story and this experience as one of my top 5 best experiences with a restaurant!!!",

I'm not sure if this was just a poor choice for a meal or if the food in general is bad, but I had three bites of each, sat staring at the poor choice of a meal I had made, and threw away the rest.  The chicken tempura was something you would order from in Hienz field. Because this is supposed to be a Chinese restaurant I mean that in the worst way possible. The chicken tempura literally came with a side of onion rings and fried potato chips. by potato chips I mean literal slices of potato that were fried in \"tempura\".   Suffice to say, I would not recommend ordering the food here. There's a ton of chinese restaurants in the area. Don't risk the chance of having a bad meal.",

While they also serve sushi, the only sushi that I've tried was a vegetable roll, which was okay, but the rice seemed slightly undercooked.   The real quality for us has been the service and the Chinese food. We've had delivery a few times, and our orders have always arrived as-ordered. While that should be the norm, it sadly hasn't been with other places. I even ordered the orange chicken, which isn't technically on the menu, and they always get it right! The chicken & broccoli is really good, and they'll make nearly anything as a tofu dish, if requested. I've ordered orange tofu with no questions asked! Not too shabby!  My favorite thing is the scallion pancake appetizer. I'm not sure why more places don't have them on the menu, but they're so yummy. A must-order if you're trying Zen. They even hold up pretty well when delivered!  If you're dining in, the space is pretty nice. You can tell it's been recently renovated. It's clean, but when we were in there it was dead, so the vibe seemed a little odd. Fortunately, the service was really good. The people that work at Zen are super nice and, as mentioned before, they'll basically make anything you request. Don't be turned off by the sketchiness from the outside. It's a generally good experience inside!",

The roll was a little underwhelming, but everything else was very yummy!  The edamame was warm and we didn't get any icky-looking bean pods. Seaweed salad is hard to mess up, but goodness knows some places try. The portion we got from Zen was appropriate for the price and very tasty. The cucumber avocado roll was skinny and dull, but that's kinda what we ordered, so no surprise there.   The entrees we ordered all looked appetizing right out of the bag. The pad thai had strips of fried tofu that were great and came with a slice of lime. This is a big deal for me because I really dislike when that lime is forgotten or replaced with lemon! It wasn't the best pad thai I've ever had & I'm not even sure it tasted much like pad thai, but the noodles were right & it wasn't too sweet & I enjoyed it anyway. The vegetable lo mein had a great savory flavor and all the veggies were cooked just right. The General Tso's tofu was the highlight for everybody. It was spicy with good-sized pieces of perfectly fried tofu and crunchy broccoli, all of which was covered in a very yummy, not-too-sweet, spicy sauce. Honestly, I can't wait to order it again.  As an added note, I picked up my order because I'd never been in here and you just never know what to expect from a Chinese restaurant that puts a menu on your doorknob, but next time I'll probably dine in. The inside of the restaurant is clean & inviting. After checking out their sushi station, I might even try a more exciting roll next time.",

The chicken in the fried rice was gross and weird... It was steamed and tasted not fresh. There were a ton of onions in the fried rice, which is weird in itself. The sushi was pretty gross... It tasted like a week old. The delivery driver was nice though. Sadly, I will not be reordering from here. Thanks for the memories, Zen. Get some fresher food.",

Sushi was warm although it may be my preference to have it cold. Won't be ordering again anytime soon.",

    "text": "This review is for take-out only. I had a rough day and I really just wanted Asian food, so I ordered the General Tso's tofu with steamed rice and my boyfriend ordered the Sesame Chicken with steamed rice.   We placed an order over the phone around 10:45PM on a Friday and they close at 11PM, but they assured us that they would deliver the food anyways. The driver seemed to be directionally challenged (he didn't know where the University of Pittsburgh is), so the mix up is probably what prolonged the delivery to around 11:45. However, the food was still hot and satisfying. There was enough tofu for three meals and they package the food in nice, reusable and microwavable packaging. The General Tso's sauce was spicy-- I love spice, but if you have a sensitive tummy I would probably go for the Sesame instead.   Best Chinese delivery that I've had in quite some time. The only downside is the $15 delivery minimum (the average entree is around $8-$9) and my lack of car on campus to pick it up myself. Craving some Chinese? Grab a friend and go in on an order for Zen.",

The sushi was nothing like sushi. While the rice inside was ok, it was especially bland. The seaweed used to wrap it was tough and rubbery. It was almost impossible to eat.   The pad Thai was not pad Thai at all. It was filled with onions and undercooked bean sprouts. It made me choke it was so awful.   The honey chicken and rice was plain and cheap. It tasted worse than McDonald's chicken.   Overall i am so embarrassed i paid money for this. Anyone who enjoys this food lacks tastebuds.",

This place isn't bad, the renovations that they made to the interior are amazing but you still have to deal with the stench of rotting food in the summer when you are walking up or down the hill. The service is good if you are dining in but there is a delivery charge, something that other places like China House (Bloomfield) don't tack on to the bill.  I order the miso soup at least once a week because it's a steal (price wise) and it isn't as salty as other places.  I have only sampled the sushi when others have ordered it so I can't comment on it,",

We got chicken teriyaki and another order substitute beef.  The beef was tough!  And flavorless.  Plus there was something in it that looks like it could either be the stem root of an orange...or the eyeball of a small animal.  I'm not gonna look at it again because I'm sure (hope)  it's the former.  Veggies were also flavorless.    We also ordered the Eagle and Angel rolls:  horrible.  The \"crunch\" in the rolls were like stale bread crumbs, so the rolls were soggy and gross.  I really hope that this review is published because, for some odd reason, most of the negative reviews are hidden.    Don't eat here.",

    "text": "Budget sushi restaurants often skimp on either quality or quantity. Zen Asian Diner manages to underdeliver on both.  The $12 rainbow roll was the worst rainbow roll I have ever seen. One expects a rainbow roll to be topped with a wealth of many different types of delicious sashimi, reflecting all the different colours of the rainbow. But the Zen Asian Diner version of this classic roll is distinguished from the California roll only by three paper-thin slivers of fish, plus some similarly millimetre-thin avocado slices on top.  The $5.25 ikura gunkan-maki was about half the size I expected, being a mere 2 cm in diameter (try searching for images of ikura gunkan-maki on Google and count the average number of delicious red spheres and compare it to my photo).  The $17 chirashi had a decent variety of fish, but the quantity was small, and worse, not very fresh at all. It is far worse than the offering from similarly priced Sushi Too on Walnut street.  Generally, one should stay away from restaurants that claim to serve all the many diverse cuisines of Asia. Zen Asian Diner is no exception. The delivery service was pretty efficient though.",

I loved my sesame tofu - the texture of the tofu was great and the sauce was sweet but tasty. The crab rangoons had just enough filling. The hot and sour soup was one of the best I've had in Pittsburgh - definitely a little on the spicier side! The veggie lo mein was also very good - it wasn't oily and had lots of veggies.

See the attached pictures which show how little we are and how awful the food looked.   The hot and sour soup was mostly oil and tasted like it. Not hot or sour taste.   The sushi rolls looked like they had been sitting around for a few days. The pieces appeared slimy and tasted horrible.   The wasabi was an unnaturally bright green sitting next to unusually dried out bright red pickled ginger. Yuck!  The pork fried rice was no better than the average fried rice you get at a mall food court fast food Chinese place. In fact, I'd rate Panda Express' fried rice over this place. The trio of meats and vegetables in brown sauce were rubbery and drowning in a brown sauce modeled after the hot and sour soup - mostly oil. Did they run out of all soups and sauces forcing them to cut everything with a 10:1 oil to soup/sauce ratio?  Finally there were the three pieces of yellowtail sashimi and the Crab Rangoon. The sashimi was the best part of the meal, so no complaints there, but the Crab Rangoon was without crab.   Never again. We dumped 95% of this $70+ order (over $80 with tip) down the drain and in the trash.",

The egg roll was all fried dough with barely any filling and the General Tso's chicken was all breading and in a weird sweet sauce. I guess that's just what you get for that bargain price of $8-10 for this combination.  On the other hand, the shrimp with broccoli was okay (at best). The portion was large and came with plenty of shrimp. The sauce was too sweet and gooey for my tastes, but it was edible.

    "text": "Delivery was 30 minutes earlier than we were initially informed...which could be nice but also inconvenient since we planned things vaguely around their stated delivery time.  I got the teriyaki chicken with miso soup. Neither had any flavor. At all. The teriyaki only tasted of black pepper...seriously. The miso soup tasted like hot water.  The husband got two rolls; spicy tuna and spicy yellowtail.  Nothing to write home about.  He also got hot and sour soup and it was basically just mushrooms.  In the end it was about $35 to figure out we wouldn't order from here again...and I'm normally the one saying we always need to give places a second chance.",

    "text": "Without Zen Sushi I probably would not have survived these past 2 years of grad school! Their delivered sushi is top-notch and gives me life and energy to study! They also have delicious general tso's chicken. The only reason I'm not giving Zen 5 stars is because I once went to their restaurant front for dinner only to discover that it is definitely more of a takeout/order out place than it is a sit in. I don't recommend eating in, but that does not subtract from the greatness that is their food. Highly recommend for ordering out!",

The rolls were okay but small and the soup is slimy with no flavor. I cannot eat the soup because it is too thick and slimy. This will be the last time I order.",

    "text": "I've been ordering from this place since it was called something else and it had good food and delivery was fast and the food was hot. The last 3 times I've ordered from here I have been disappointed. I love General Tso chicken (i know its not authentic) and what I got was soggy chicken in a sauce that was sweet with no heat, The quart of wonton soup had only one wonton in it and it was only a noodle wrapper w/o any filling. Speaking about filling, the crab rangoon doesn't have any crab in it and all it is is cream cheese and a little sugar in it.  This last time, which is my last time, I ordered egg rolls (tasteless) and Kung Pao Chicken which was just ok, and once again Crab Rangoon (with no crab) and everything was just so disappointing. I now need to find a good place that is reasonably priced that delivers",
