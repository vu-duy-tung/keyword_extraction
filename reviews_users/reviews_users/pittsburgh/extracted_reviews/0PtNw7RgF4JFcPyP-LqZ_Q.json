Food was hot and joe pie was tasty, crust is good, like a fluffy handle but not thick bread base. Fries are a home run for delivery fries. Ultra crisp, i used them to make a tasty poutine at home. The tiramisu is a treat but i wish it was a larger portion (of course)! So happy it's in the neighborhood and can't wait to order breakfast on a Sunday for delivery after reading other reviews.",

Their strawberry banana French toast is quickly becoming my favorite.   Haven't been to their Edgewood location, but purely from my delivery experience, Joe's has great food and their delivery service is great.  Highly highly recommend! Maybe a move is in order?

The second time, we ordered pizza. Neither my husband nor I were fans. The sauce was oddly sweet, and the cheese and other toppings just kind of tasted cheap.

Delivery time is always quick and reasonable as well. I've never had a bad pizza from here. I've never had a bad anything to be honest .Great place for pizza wings subs and salads!",

Their white sauce is good, specialty pizzas are great. However their red sauce is too sweet and their basic pizzas are not good. Don't order the Sicilian, taste and texture resembled cardboard. Not good.",

They will toss the pizza thin like NY style if you ask them!!  Pasta and meatballs are very good as well and their calzones mmmm!!  I have had their salads and pretty much everything on the menu.  I am only home once a month and in the week I order once or twice from them!!!",

    "text": "Absolute worst experience as a customer. Do not order online, the process is horrible. I ordered online and apparently I accidentally tapped the tap to remove button on cheese when trying to order a a half cheese half pepperoni pizza. The driver walked up to deliver the pizza and asked if i  wanted a pizza with no cheese right.  When I said no, he said well thats what's on the ticket. He then showed me a ticket that said no cheese and told me he would call his manager. Then he came back and said his manager wasn't in but the assistant said there is nothing they can do. The next minute I got a call from someone at the store just blaming me. Not offering a solution not willing to listen to me. Just told me i was wrong and not them.",

Thanks We ordered again on Sunday. Chicken Parmesan and spaghetti and meatballs with salad and garlic bread. Fantastic!",

    "text": "Ordered the chicken bacon ranch pizza last night - very good! Delivery was on time and food was hot. The pens game had just started so I could understand if they were busy. The guy went to our neighbor's by accident but he is cool so no problem...however, we paid online ahead of time so it technically could've been stolen if delivered to someone not as nice lol. We also got fried zucchini which was the good flat, thin plank style that we like.   This is our first time, and we only got delivery, so I can't really speak for anything else...but their menu is pretty extensive and they do breakfast/brunch (delivery!!) so I definitely want to try that. Pizza was even good reheated for the next day.   Mineo's is still my favorite, but they don't deliver...so this so far has been the best if you don't feel like going out or leaving the house! I might not have even found these guys, but having just moved to the area...they mailed us a menu and it worked! Excited to try something else from these guys. Thanks for offering another good option in the area.",

They are accurate with carry out times and the food is always hot and fresh. I would recommend their garlic knots and their ranch dressing is perfect. The workers are very friendly. Once for a carry out order, they had forgotten my side of ranch so I walked back in and they gave me extra and were very apologetic. They have a very wide selection and I can't wait to try more from their menu.",

Would have been better with cucumber sauce so a little bummed. Very clean dining area. Phone was ringing pretty often with orders around 2:30pm so that's promising for them. Give it a try. I also know they deliver (including breakfast!!!) within 5 miles of Edgewood Towne Centre.   Update: the owner contacted me directly to let me know he was going to use the feedback to train staff which is great. Also offered another shawarma on him. Very good service on his part. If I'm ever in the area, might take him up on that offer.",

I absolutely love how sweet the sauce is and how rich the crust is... the only issue I have is that the quality of pizza isn't always consistent.
