    "text": "Why did it take me so long to discover this place? Been in Pittsburg for work for some time now and only discovered this gem last night!  You like Scotch?  You must come here! Page+  list of a variety of Scotch to try. Thanks to my cool older bro' I was introduced to good Scotch a few years ago and can say this is the spot to go for that.  I ordered the Lamb Shepard's Pie to-go. After a few bites I realized all I knew about Shepard's Pie was a lie! This was legit. A wonderful hearty stew filled with a variety of root veggies and red jacket potatoes (the best for you to consume). I was comforted as I enjoyed each bite on my hotel bed while watching the tube. Swaying a bit like a little kid as munched on.  Lots more on the menu to try, and as I usually do when I find gems in different cities I will be back probably for the rest of my dinners while here to try the other menu selections.  ps. I spotted Scotch egg on the menu, I never knew it existed outside of African cuisine...and I realized there is so much more for me to learn about Scottish food!   The staff at the bar was cool, making my experience that much better. He did look at me funny when I asked for ketchup for my Shepard's Pie, a way I always ate my Shepard's pies of the past; after tasting this one I understood how ridiculous my request must have sounded. When you have authentic flavorful SPie, there is no place for a condiment like ketchup.",

I recently went here with my family while they were visiting Pittsburgh. The food was delicious as always, but the nice thing about going with more people is that I was able to try so many different dishes.  Some of the favorites of the night were the glamorgan corquettes, which were delicious and as a New Yorker were really reminiscent of a great knish especially topped with the delicious mustard sauce. I also really liked my sisters fish and chips and my humongous portion of macaroni and cheese with brisket on top, which was out of this world, but also enough to feed a small army and was great as leftovers!   I know I will be back often, and can't wait to introduce more family and friends to it!",

    "text": "Came to Pittsburgh for valentines weekend with my boyfriend. Our first stop was the south side after hearing rave reviews, and decided on pipers after reading all the good comments on yelp. But after eating dinner here my boyfriend and I are left dumbstruck wondering why this place has 4.5 stars and feeling worried what other places with lesser stars will be like.   The main problem was our waiter. While he seemed very knowledgeable about scotch he was less knowledgable on other things- like what it takes to be a good waiter. We ordered an appetizer and never received it and I asked for a water twice but finally had to go to the bar to get one myself. While on the subject of the bar, the beer that my bf ordered, and has ordered before elsewhere, tasted so watered down a bud light would have tasted better. Not that we could've complained because after we ordered, we didn't see our waiter again until time to pay. He was seen socializing with other people, but we must not have deemed worthy. Maybe we should've been tipped off by the table on one side of us, whom I overheard our waiter saying to them after they asked for their bill \"oh you got your food already?\" And at another table he explained to some girls that he doesn't work for tips, he gets paid a normal salary, which is maybe why he didn't care about helping us. The food was just mediocre, I definitely wouldn't come back even if I lived closer.",

Because it is the absolute perfect winter meal, and then they could've avoided that whole cannibalism thing.   For only about $10 at Piper's, you'll get a huge, hearty serving of the most rich, flavorful, lamb stew you've ever had, topped with crispy potatoes, and filled with even more. This one delicious, piping-hot bowl will sustain you for days. If you eat the whole thing, I promise you won't even have any room left for the guy who was sitting in 7C.",

    "text": "This place is always packed on a Friday or Saturday night (I've been given 2+ hour wait times on multiple occasions), but it's not very hard to see why.  The business which makes it difficult for a group is caused by the things that make it so attractive to a group.  First, it's simply a nice place to hang out.  The staff is friendly and knowledgeable (if a bit slow sometimes); the decor is nice and on-theme; and the crowd is a far cry more mature and diverse than what comes to mind when you mention \"South Side Bar\" to your average Pittsburgher.  Second, the food isn't just your usual bar food.  That fare is available, but they also have a lot of options from across the pond--Scottish and British specialties, many with a North American accent.  Not every item on their extensive menu is a winner, but once you figure out what you like, you'll get far more hits than misses.  Third, if you're a fan of single malt Scotch whiskies, this is easily one of the best bars in the county to explore the category.  The entire whisky list is great, but the offerings from Scotland are without equal (at least among all the bars I've been to or heard about in and near Pittsburgh--the selection is also bigger than that of any single liquor store I've been to in the state).  So check out Piper's, but please, not all at once and preferably not when I'm going there.  It's too crowded already.  Don't make me regret this review.",

On two separate occasions I ordered the shepherd's pie and absolutely loved it.  It's very filling, although you want to eat it all in one sitting.  I visited here most recently with my boyfriend.  The waitress was extremely friendly.  I ordered the chicken curry - the last available order, so it must have been popular - and my boyfriend ordered a steak.  It took a good bit to arrive, but they were also extremely busy.  I got the curry as mild as possible and it was still pretty spicy! I loved it though.  My boyfriend's order was a little less appetizing, as he ordered it medium and it was very nearly rare. Our waitress was very kind about it and immediately took it back to cook some more.  After that, it was fine, but I still think my boyfriend was less than impressed.  Despite that, I will definitely be back.  They have a nice beer selection.  Everyone is very friendly.  Having a British pub in the Southside is just overall cool too.",

They've recently started baking their own bread, including for their sandwiches.  Their Pittsburgh salads use good steak. Their pub burger is my favorite burger in the city.

Brian was always manning the bar, ready to serve up a Strongbow from the tap, and the boxtys were always incredible.  Well - things change. I've moved away now, but I still stop by Pipers when I come back to town to visit. They use ground sausage instead of real bangers in the Irish Boxtys now, which is a bummer, but it's still the most incredible brunch place you could wish for.  The people are great, the food is delicious, the beer list is fabulous (they usually have at least 2 cask beers available, and the tap list is extensive).  Basically, if you live in Pittsburgh, you should be eating here.  If you're just visiting town, stop in.  And if you ever meet someone who doesn't like this place, push them to the ground, and hold them there until the police can arrive, and then explain the issue and that the person is insane, and the police will probably lock them up for the good of society.",

Speaking of beer, they have an awesome draft selection- tons of dark beers, wheat beers, ciders, IPAs- there is something for everyone. If you aren't feeling like an alcoholic beverage, get their draft non-alcoholic root beer. It's incredible! It's a little heavier of a root beer, so it's not something that's easy to chug quickly. But it's perfect to sip on while enjoying a game or waiting for your meal. Last time I visited Piper's, I ordered their thai chili chicken wrap. My bf ordered their burger & his mom ordered their beef stew. It was a Saturday evening & they were a little busy. Our service was awesome- I thinkkkk our server was named Tim- he was super friendly and attentive to our table. The thai chicken wrap was huge- I was starved & only was able to eat half of it. The fries were delicious, too. You might think it's odd to order a \"thai\" chicken wrap at an Irish pub- but it's not, their sauce is awesome & not too spicy & the slaw was fresh & delicious. They have tons of vegan and vegetarian options on their menu- curries, salads, wings, etc. One thing that you need to order when you visit Piper's- their dessert. This time around, it was a salted caramel & pecan cheesecake- it was so good. This place is perfect for a delicious & filling dinner in the Southside. Also check out their sister pub next door, Pub Chip Shop.",

I give four stars for the food and five stars for the service, and will leave my rating as 5 stars here because where the food wasn't superior the service made up for it.   I had the scotch eggs [note to Piper's; absolutely brilliant idea to combine buffalo sauce with scotch eggs!!! I will be doing this at home now too.], fish & chips and bread pudding. My wife had the curry vindaloo and baked brie. The fish (haddock) was pretty great, but the chips were kind of meh. They tasted like frozen chips and weren't fried long enough, but they were edible with the malt vinegar. The tartar sauce for the fish wasn't the greatest. I think Piper's could zest there tartar up a bit and make it great whereas it's a little bland now. The curry vindaloo was absolutely amazing for pub food! The baked brie was also amazing! The rest of the 1-star deduction for food is because of the water. The water we were served tasted absolutely awful.   The service by Phil is what makes this a 5-star review instead of a 4-star review. He was so kind and awesome, and the estimations he voluntarily gave for the timing of food arrival were pretty close to perfect. He was so good at keeping up with our table that we didn't even think to complain about the water, tartar sauce, chips, or the one time I waited like a whole 3 minutes with an empty diet Pepsi glass. lol He was really on top of everything! Great service Phil! :)  If we're ever in Pittsburgh again we will definitely be returning to Piper's!   Also, this pub as well as our server did not seem to have any problem at all with a couple of lesbian brides in rainbow-flag wedding shirts. I am nor sure if we just got lucky or if the place is generally gay friendly, but our experience was friendly. Thanks Piper's. :)",

The beer selection is also quite respectable with a slant towards bottled English beers. They also have cask beer on tap from East End brewing company, which is always a solid choice.   As others have said, the dinner portions are huge. The fish and chips could feed me for a few meals.   The real highlight of this spot is during a soccer (i mean football) game. Their website tells when all the upcoming matches are, and it's one of the few places in Pittsburgh where you'll hear chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\" when USA scores in a match.",

So of course a bunch of us ordered the Pub burger with Stilton cheese and bacon. It wasn't one of the best burgers I've ever had, but it was pretty good. Crispy on the outside, moist, flavorful - I just wish it were less well done and a little juicier in the middle. Fries were just OK.   BUT the Scottish ale gravy on the lamb sheperd's pie had some definite wow factor. I would come back just for that dish.",

I did appreciate that they did not have music blaring loud, so you could actually hear yourself speaking. Our waitress was friendly and attentive; she refilled our drinks without us having to ask her. We shared fried zucchini as an appetizer. It was delicious and the portion size was huge. We ended up taking half of it home. I got the 4 onion soup and it was very good, but I wish they would have included melted cheese over the top the way you get french onion soup. I had a chicken salad, it was good and the chicken was very well seasoned and succulent. The chicken was the star of the salad for sure. For entrees Vi had the corned beef and cabbage, which she really enjoyed, and I had the Shepherd's pie. The portion size of the Shepherd's pie was massive! Instead of using mashed potatoes they had potatoes broken up into pieces. Also included were carrots and mushrooms along with plenty of delicious, moist morsels of beef. I was so stuffed I could only eat about one fourth of my Shepherd's pie, so I took the rest of it home. The food is high quality and you really get an impressive value for your money. I definitely plan on returning!",

They have a good draft beer selection, but also had a cask ale, which I believe was made on site. I don't remember the name of it, but they only had one, and it had light fruity tones, and was very good. The food is more upscale for a pub - smoked salmon platters with salmon tartar, cheese plates with imported irish cheeses (some made with guiness), and curried dishes for example. I also had the lamb shepherd's pie - a dish that I would very rarely get - but this one was very rich and flavorful, and very tasty - a wonderful dish to get on a cold day. Their menu is also very reasonably priced. I have been there several times during the week, and it has always been relatively quiet, and very easy to get a seat. The dining room is in the back, separated from the bar, so it is quieter. The dining room also has 2 large TV's to watch the game. They also have a decent, large fish sandwich.",

Letting people take up tables for 3 hours is an absolute joke. It's basic restaurant customer service 101....turn the tables as quickly as possible. If people are lingering ask them to head to the bar. Even offer to buy them a drink! But never have people waiting over 2 1/2 hours for a table for pub food....EVER! We are regular patrons but today was pathetic. The host was clueless and the bar was understaffed, all on a Sunday morning to say the least. What a poor excuse to say you can't ask people to give up their table....are you kidding!! They are basically just sitting there for free and you are losing revenue all because a host and wait staff don't understand how a restaurant should operate. We all love to come and watch the games on Saturday and Sunday mornings but it should be stated when seated that there is a 90 minute time limit per table and it should be ENFORCED. People will understand. Let them finish watching the matches at the bar and TURN THE TABLE! PERIOD! Again the blue haired host needs to be fired for his lack of ability and lack of customer service skills! This may be the last time we ever go to Piper's....how sad!!",

In retrospect, a huge plate of meat and potatoes wasn't the ideal meal to order on a sweltering summer evening, particularly since the dish comes straight off the broiler to you and is guaranteed to raise the temperature of your table 20 degrees. While I can't say that the chestnut flavor was strong, the entire dish was well seasoned, hearty, and completely delicious. And for under $10, it's a lot of food for your dollar. I also appreciated the beer selection and thought the atmosphere was cozy.  Great place!",

Not only was there several things, but the seitan wings served with vegan ranch dressing and Thai chili sauce, were the stuff of dreams.  Since I was on a seitan kick, I had the not fake BLT, crispy seitan on farm bread, with lots of lettuce and tomato and typical British-fish and chip-style fries.

My group of four arrived to a bustling Piper's on Sunday for a quartet of \"boxties.\" A boxty is a traditional Irish potato pancake and, in this case, offered with a variety of fillings. I went for the Irish Boxty - a mash up of ham, sausage, egg and cheese. Mine arrived on the burnt side, but I don't mind a little black on my boxty. It was a solid \"good\" but not much more. I'd probably season the sausage or the whole thing if given the choice, a sentiment echoed throughout my group. Still, I left full (for sure) and will be back for more of Piper's dinner fare since I think that's more my speed in general. Cheers mates.",

As you walk, there is a long bar down the left hand side and a few tables along the back wall.  It is not an overly huge space and it can easily get crowded.  In the back of the restaurant there are a bunch of tables for dining and beverage consumption purposes.  The place gets crowded at night and during futbol matches.  Sunday Brunch is always crazy there, so if you have visions of going there for brunch, be prepared to wait.    Let's get down to my favorite part of this place.  It is hands down the beverage menu.  I really really really enjoy Whiskey (Whisky) and beer and Pipers delivers on both.  They carry a lot of Whiskey from Scotland (all areas), Ireland, the USA and Canada.  They also serve Whiskey from PA.  As for beer, they have over 30+ beers on tap plus two brews on cask.  They show a lot of love for the state of PA and locally when it comes to beer.  In addition, they provide lots of English and Irish brews.  The beer is goes across numerous styles (Stouts, IPA's, Brown Ales, Scotch Ales, Lagers, Porters, Wheat beers, Hefeweizens...etc.  They also over ciders and mead.   The beverage menu is extremely solid.    I have to admit I have not eaten here too often.  When I have eaten here, I have downright loved it.  I am not very original when I order, I stick to my staples of Bangers and Mash or the Shepherds Pie.  Both are delicious and the prices are ridiculously good.  It is really good comfort food.    The service here is always spot on.  All the bartenders really know their stuff when it comes to beers and whiskey.    If you are looking for a great little place on the South Side, Pipers is a must visit.  If you are able to get in and get a seat, you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Great Guinness. Very creamy, without a hint of bitterness in sight, they clearly know how to take good care of it. It's on par with the best Guinness I've ever had. That alone is worth a visit.  Thankfully, they also have more tricks up their sleeves. We tried the appetizer of curry and chips. It came with a very large portion of thick french fries with a delicious curry dip in a bowl in the center of the plate. So much flavor packed in there, really good, and not something you'll find at your average pub. Highly recommended.  The decor is very bright with seating at the bar (this is what we chose) and several dinner tables taking up the majority of the space, which makes me think they cater more to diners than to drinkers. Still, it's not to be missed.",

    "text": "This place is just so awesome.   After 9 hours on the road to Pittsburgh from New York, we were looking for something substantial that wouldn't break the bank. For months my sister had been bragging to me about how awesome it was and how the food was so good so I told her, put your money where your mouth is, and we headed over. (Needless to say, I lost the bet.)   We were seated quickly though it was a bit chaotic. I'm not quite used to the slower service since I'm not from around here but it was decent. I had to send back my cider because it was flat and a little funky from sitting in the cooler too long. But that of course took at least 10 minutes to do and we hadn't even ordered our food yet.   After drinks were settled and everyone was pleased with their selection we went on to the food menu.   For starters:  Glamorgan croquettes: a substantial portion for the $8 price tag. We each had one and took the last go to for my brother-in-law. Crispy on the outside, gooey and cheesy on the inside, paired with the most delicious and tangy mustard sauce. These were a highlight of the meal.   Vindaloo bacon candy on a stick: This was good. Definitely not the best bacon candy I've had, but it was a decent attempt. I don't think it's fair to call it candy because it wasn't sweet at all. It also wasn't crispy. It was just a semi-warm slab of pork belly with some vindaloo spices. Could have been executed better.   Smoked seafood chowder: I'll be frank. This was disgusting. The chowder had no movement to it, because overly floured and the raw flour taste was still present. There was barely any seafood in the chower itself. It was full of undercooked leeks and undercooked potatoes. It was just a mess.   Entrees:  My fiance had the pork special. Pork loin, sweet potatoes, maple, asparagus.  It was delicious and perfectly cooked.   My twin sister ordered the goat cheese stuffed chicken but they were out of the certain chicken they used so they offered her a stuffed chicken breast at a lower cost. It was good but the red lentils underneath the chicken were almost inedible due to the high salt content.   My older sister ordered the mac and cheese with pulled brisket. This was so so so good  The portion was insane. 1lb of pasta and 3/4 of a pound of brisket. Needless to say that between the 4 of us we didn't even make a dent.   As for me, I had the fish and chips. Holy crap. These were, by far, the best I've ever had. The fish was tender, the batter was crisp, the tartar sauce was perfect, and the chips were thick and substantial. It was delicious, though a little greasy.   Dinner for 4, with drinks, appetizers, entrees, and leftovers, was a little over $100. Insane. Service was a little spotty, but it was busy. I'd definitely return. The food was just too good.",

    "text": "Piper's Pub was good enough for me to return to two nights in a row. I had been there in the past and enjoyed it, but the Arsenal Ginger cider and chips craving I had Friday didn't end and I had to satiate it Saturday night as well.   Immediately after sitting down my boyfriend points out that the drafts are $2 off from 9pm-11pm and it's 9:30pm so we're excited. Score for us, considering I has big plans to have another Arsenal draft. We also ordered two entrees, which were beyond wonderful. Best fish and chips I've had in a long time. The chips are perfectly cooked and they conveniently have malt vinegar at all of the tables (yay!). The service was also good and the server checked on us multiple times with updates on our food before it was brought out from the kitchen.   So far, it's my second night in a row at Piper's and I'm sitting happy as a clam. Cue the check. All drafts are regularly priced and when we ask the waiter he states that the only special he knows about only includes Magner's. So we figure we misread the sign out front and pay our bill. But the sign outside states $2 off all drafts 9-11pm. We have a small discussion about going back in for our $10 off the five drafts we had, and my boyfriend decides its not worth it. My friend and I have another small conversation and decide to go back in. We tell the server about the sign and he offers to make it up to us with another draft, etc, but we're about to catch a few more Pokemon and need to drive at some point, so we say \"no\" to the offers. The bartender gets involved and states that \"its an old special and there isn't even a button for the special anymore.\" He then says \"I want you guys to come back so I'll give you the money out of my tip bucket\" and walks away. My friend and I are so horrified by the idea that we also start to speed walk out of the place.   I guess the conclusion my friend and I came to was that it didn't feel honest and I would never take money from someone's tips. I don't think many people would and I would have just preferred to have the money put back on my card. Bottom line- the end of the night interaction was so uncomfortable that I probably won't be returning to Pipers anytime soon.",

That said you can usually find a soccer game on at least one of the televisions.   The food here is always excellent, with their take on traditional British pub fare. I particularly enjoy the boxty for breakfast while my son loves the waffles and chicken. The bloody mary is one of the better in the city and perfect for a morning watching the Gunners.   Moving on the lunch and dinner the fish and chips, sheppards pie and bangers and mash are tremendous. Also no stop is complete with out the scotch eggs.",

I usually am here for drinks on St. Patty's Day, so this was a much calmer experience.  What a great pub menu.  Probably one of the best places in town for fish and chips.  We all shared the Peanut Chicken Satay and also the fried zucchini. Probably too much for a starter for just three people but we were hungry and both apps were great!  For dinner I had the Bacon Candy BLT.  That bacon is deliciously sweet and savory and I admit, even after appetizers, I ate every bite of that sandwich!  Lots of good brews to pick from but even better cocktail and whiskey list.  Our server was absolutely fantastic - great personality and truly on the ball.  I regret that I don't remember his name otherwise I'd mention it.",

Could they possibly deliver a repeat performance? Do they dare tease my tongue again? ...This is going in an unexpected direction... back to business.  All of my friends absolutely adore Piper's and I knew right away the food and beer pairing was going to be hearty and well worth the money I throw down. Neither time have I even been a little disappointed. The meals have flavor which is something I find lacking so often, and there is nothing worse than bland food. They also have substance, half of a shepherd's pie and I'm carrying around not just left overs but a sizable food baby.  The interior is on the small side so I've shied away from taking overly large parties there for occasions like my birthday. It's not uncomfortable though and if you wanted to try they may be willing to attempt to accommodate.  They have a great beer selection including a lot of local brews, which is sure to keep me coming back to any establishment. I don't think I've ever had a beer I didn't like from there. The wait staff is always prompt and helpful in recommending a beer to try based on what you like.  The prices are pretty on par for the quality of food and portion sizes.  In short, if you love hearty flavorful meals and great beers, Piper's should definitely be on your list of places to try when in the South Side.",

Granted it's the only bar in PIttsburgh I've ever been to, but when it's right you know it. Right?  We arrived with a party of seven on Sunday afternoon looking for brunch, it was packed but they got us seated about a Bloody Mary later. Orders up, English and Irish Breakfasts, boxtys, omelettes all around. It's a lot of food but we loved what we got.   Excellent beer list (try the Fallen Apple if you can), great Bloodys and while I personally found the Scotch Egg a little dry, they're also like pizza. Even when they're not great, they're still great.  The prices are reasonable for that much effort and the environment is welcoming. PP, I'm into you.",

    "text": "Now that I have a little bit of faith in America's ability to produce a few good British restaurants, I'm determined to try as many as possible. My husband and I ate at Piper's Pub on a Tuesday night between Christmas and New Years, and it turned out to be perfect cold-weather comfort food.   Our recent method is to order a palette of different dishes to share, and it was some tough deciding with Piper's huge menu. We at last chose the fish & chips with a side of curry sauce, Welsh vegetarian sausages and the Gaelic four onion soup. I was also tempted by the full English breakfast but will have to try it next time.  The fish & chips were good but definitely more American style. The vindaloo sauce was great with the chips but at medium too hot for my dulled tastebuds after living in Oklahoma for half a year. The Welsh sausages were new to me, so I can't speak for their authenticity, but they were delicious and served with a sweet apple chutney that complemented the savoriness quite well.  The onion soup was by far my favorite, described as \"caramelized leeks, scallions, red and white onions de glazed with English Pale Ale and finished with a Stilton cheese-crusted crouton.\" I can honestly say I tasted a hint of everything in that list, unlike many restaurants that exaggerate with descriptions. Even the little bit of Stilton cheese on top was memorable!  The drinks menu was extensive, with an entire list of Pennsylvania draughts.   Our server was warm and friendly, and he got us out of there in record time when we mentioned we were running a bit late for the Penguins game at Consol.  Definitely a new cold-weather favorite.",

That's the sound I made as I pounded the table with my fist while devouring it; it was that delectable. It is the Loch Ness Monster of sandwiches, and I, channeling St. Columba, barely turned it back.    Allegedly, the name \"banger\" came from the fact that these sausages would burst when cooked.

What have I eaten there? How about Shepard's Pie or Bangers and Mash. Know what Boxty is? They do it with style with rashers (bacon for the uninitiated). Guinness Stew in a bread bowl for that cold winter night.  Give then a try, you will not be disappointed.",

In fact, so much scotch that it's a known destination for scotch ... scotch, scotch, down to my belly ... tastings.   Anyway, Piper's is great, doesn't matter when you go to eat - the menu offers similar selections for lunch and dinner. It's a vegetarian/pescatarian paradise - I go for the Ploughman's Platter (or Ploughman's wrap, same goodies just all rolled up), the Salmon Platter (good for sharing) and the soups have all been delicious. Seeing the entrees come out is enough to make my mouth water, even if it is a beefy-beefed up Shephard's Pie. Portions are pretty big on everything I've had; enough for a meal+ in most cases.   And I usually steer away from describing scene, but it doesn't feel like South Side really (this is most times a good thing); even being nestled so discretely in between our neighborhood Burger King and Primanti's. The all wood interior somehow doesn't feel too dark, and it's a crowd ranging from middle aged dad's sipping the 21 year Glennfiddich at 1:30 in the afternoon and ... well, people like me.",

This is just a good place to get great food. The serving sizes are huge, and everything we had tasted great.

Now they have sandwiches and lots of mexican dishes, who wants their new menu items black bean soup, tacos and dirty rice ect.  at a pub? Compared to exquisite authentic pub dinners that are not nearly as good. The shepherds pie had raw extremely pink ground lamb that was inedible!

    "text": "A Yelp* search for a great pub pointed me toward Piper's Pub located in the city's interesting Southside which is packed with a wide variety of food and drinking options. Locating the place can be a bit difficult, even for \"locals\" I'm told, and parking is a pain in the tush for everyone.  Well, it was worth the effort. I received a warm welcome and luckily secured a seat in the bar area where 5 TV's provided easy looks at baseball and soccer. My server, Barbara, visited quickly and took my drink order; their tasty draft root beer which was served ice cold...perfect for the hot Sunday afternoon.  My Gaelic Four Onion soup was far from the typical stuff you can have in ten million other joints. No melted cheese glob served in a crock here. Instead, you'll get a unique blend of flavors capped with a fragrant crouton with sharp flavor. While tempted by other entree options I went with the Chicken Mushroom Cottage Pie and am glad I did. The generous, tasty portion was topped with a perfectly prepared, super-sized puff pastry. I couldn't finish it but enjoyed all I could.  I'm pretty stingy with 5 Star ratings but Piper's deserves the top rating. Pub snobs won't find a 200- year old back bar but I've never known a piece of furniture that could improve the flavor of food or improve service.  Visit and you'll find a nice crowd, a great selection of beers and music that included everything from The Butterfield Blues Band to The Seeds (worth doing a search of both if you don't know them already!). Plus, you might meet Barb who, in spite of working a busy room, will take time to make you comfortable with conversation welcomed by any visitor.",

I will admit to you that I pretty much get the same thing to eat every single time I go: a Rachel with fries. I'm almost embarrassed that  I haven't broadened my horizons with regard to the menu in all the years I've been going here, but when a place does something SO right, it's hard to quit. The marble rye that is NEVER soggy, the Swiss that is always melted just right over the turkey, the cole slaw that is creamy dreamy, the Russian dressing that is just the right balance of sweet and sour. Seriously, I am drooling for that sandwich writing this review.  I typically go here with my best friend or husband, both of whom get either the Sheppard's Pie or Guinness Stew -- left overs are always taken (if there are any, which, typically there are not).   I've been here at least 50 times over the last 9 or so years, I cannot think of a single instance of bad service or food. The biggest disappointment I've ever had concerning Piper's was a few years back and they were closed temporarily because of building issues (flooding, I think) and I couldn't go!",

The BLT is so phenomenal.. my mouth is watering just thinking about it. You can choose to get it with a vindaloo candied bacon that is really great. I don't typically like mayonnaise but theirs is a dill mayo that's wonderful. The fries are crispy and delicious. Piper's is a good place to take vegetarian and vegan friends as they have plenty of non meat options. And don't forget dessert.

I should have asked when I ordered. Next time I'll be prepared.  Salmon and mustard sauce was delish and fingerling potatoes were also delicious.  Barely any arugula. May as well have been none. I thought it was to be a salad mainly.  But the meal was very good.  Meal 2: BBQ Pork Bap - A pile of our dry rubbed, smoked pulled pork with a tangy bourbon bbq sauce piled on a fresh baked Bap topped with crispy beer onions and choice of side  My husband had to end up eating this with fork and knife and the bun became too wet, but he still thought it was a very good sandwich and he would order it again, which is the big test of any meal for him. BBQ sauce was very good - probably too much on the sandwich, but no real worries on that part this time.  Dessert - I got the Sticky Toffee Pudding and I just really disliked the flavor. I have previously tried and enjoyed the bread pudding and would probably order that again, but not the sticky toffee pudding.  I've included pics of these meals and dessert.",

The service was fantastic, the drinks were unique, the beer was cold, and the food was PHENOMENAL!  My daughter had the fish and chips, and they knocked it out of the park.  Being from Wisconsin, we like to think we're very well-versed in fried fish.  This was easily one of the best pieces of fried fish I've had in quite a long time.  Our table also got the Scotch eggs appetizer, which were amazing.  I really feel like anything you order from their menu is bound to satisfy even the pickiest eater.  We will be back again!",

I'm vegetarian and eat a low sodium diet so finding food for me to eat beyond variations on a salad can be a bit of a challenge. This place was my pick because there were so many vegetarian options and they had great looking meat dishes for my wife to choose from.  My wife had the Pie & Mash from the Chip Shop, the tower of food that came out was impressive, I tried to get a picture but she cut into too quickly. She said that was delicious. She also ordered a stormy and spicy which she said was fantastic.  We asked the server for vegetarian recommendations and he detailed all the vegetarian dishes for me and let me know I could substitute things to make them fit my diet. I ordered the Vegan Vegetable & Bean Stew which was massive, I actually got 3 meals out of it. The stew was delicious and it was topped with the largest piece of puffed pastry I have ever seen.  We had ordered chips with curry but either our waiter forgot to put it in or the kitchen forgot to make it which was find because even without the chips we had WAY too much food.   We'll definitely be back since they have a long list of food for me to try. This is definitely going to one of out \"go to\" places in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I was here last week on Thursday at lunch time.   Not many folks in the place.  Sat in the bar area and was served by the bartender.   I guess it was a mistake to enter this place wearing sports gear of a Pittsburgh rival,  because the bartender, who was wearing Pittsburgh sports gear, was apparently triggered by this.  An innocent question of \"Will you have any specials on for the Super Bowl?\" somehow opened the door for him to  let me know how awful the team is that I support.    I can handle contentious sports banter but I don't expect it to come from someone who is serving me nor do I expect a server to speak to me in a borderline hostile tone in any context.  The service itself seemed kind of slow.  Had to wait a while to receive the menu and then be checked on for my order.    He started off good with bringing drinks and then kind of slowed down.      They have a nice selection of beer and cider here.   I ordered the Shepherd's Meatloaf, which is lamb & beef meatloaf,  red skinned mashed, and a vegetable of their choice.   It was okay,  but the texture of everything made me feel like I was eating leftovers.   The meatloaf was stiff,  the mashed was really firm,    the zucchini seemed barely cooked.      I've had decent meals here in the past.  Their burgers are pretty good.   But you never know what you're going to get with this place,  and my  bizarre experience on Thursday is a prime example.     I don't know if I will return.  When I eat out,  I want to relax.  I want to feel welcomed.  I don't want to think,  \"Maybe I shouldn't go there today because I left the house with my team's gear on\".",

I posted a question in the Talk forum and the Pittsburgh folks did not let me down.  Piper's Pub was the overwhelming response and it delivered.    Colombia played at noon so we arrived at about 11am.  We initially sat in the dining area, but after weighing our options and seeing some space we moved over to the bar.  Our waitress for those 5 minutes was friendly and funny.  At the bar, there was one bartender but he moved fast enough to keep all of us very happy.  I stuck with an East End IPA and I was very happy with it.  My wife and I split our meals.  I had the chicken & waffles and she had the boxty of the day.  Both were delicious.  It was my first boxty and I didn't get to take a picture of it, but damn was it good.  It was a carnitas one with smoked pork, peppers, onions, cheese and pico de gallo on top.  F'N delicious would have been my response that day, and it still sticks.  The sausage gravy on the chicken & waffles was quite good too.    The place was packed with football fans.  English, Italians and yes even Colombians.  It was fun a fun place to watch the World Cup and I have to imagine a great place to watch the EPL.  I look forward to returning on a Saturday and taking in that scene.",

It is a very busy spot, so patrons are treated with little respect because they know someone else will come in and fill your space.  Food took over an hour to come out, and was subpar to say the least. When requesting a particular drink, the waitress  laughed at me as if I should've known they didn't have a fully stocked bar.  I definitely would have left if I wasn't with a group of people who suggested the venue. There are so many other great dining spots on the southside, there is no need to go somewhere that will treat you like your presence is a hassle. My favorite part of the night was when the host peeked over at our table ,as if he was checking to see everything was OK, then when I went to speak to him he said \"I'm not your waiter\". Where in the world is this acceptable?!?!",

As a returned study abroad student who spent a semester in the UK, I've developed cravings for bangers and mash and shepherd's pie every once in a while so I needed to find an authentic British pub!  This was pretty close to it.  I got the beef shepherd's pie.  It came with a side salad served with a pumpernickel raisin roll that was still warm and soft from the oven.  The pie itself was great but a little dry.  It also was baked in a shallow plate rather than a casserole dish.  I sampled my friend's bangers and mash plate.  Delicious!  The bangers tasted just the way I remembered them tasting in the wetherspoons of Manchester!  The dining area fills up quickly, especially when some of the tables are reserved, but we were able to be seated at the bar.   Great service and atmosphere.  Good selection of British/Irish/Scottish beers on tap at a good price. Would've liked to hear some British accents but I hear this place goes crazy during football (British football, that is) matches so that should be fun!",

I have been hunting a good whiskey bar in Pittsburgh, and this joint has an amazing whiskey menu. On top of that they serve great cask beer, and it's served right (room temp and smooth). When I was there one of the staff members took me on a tour, and showed me there hand built cask system in the basement, unreal and well-done.  On top of that the food is top-notch, and the portions are huge, It's hard to find traditional pub fare like this anywhere in America.   OH - and they watch soccer there! Good food, great whiskey, cask beer, and soccer - there isn't much more you could ask for.  The staff is knowledgeable, and it shows that they all love this place and their jobs - which I think makes any establishment worth supporting.",

After all, we've all eaten at British style pubs before and let's be honest - the experience is typically acceptable but not incredible.  I was wrong.  This place gets 5 stars across the board.  First, on the most important thing - alcohol!  You have a great selection of brews, some expected, others less known - mostly British beers.  You also have a great selection of whiskey.  While the whiskey can get up there in price, the beer is priced at your typical city rates.     Now onto food.  Their portions are monstrous for the price you pay.  You are getting a steal!  This place has incredible food with incredible prices that come out as large platters.  I was with a party of 4.  We all had to box our food up and take some of it home with us.    Finally, this was a rare tavern that had amicable and hospitable staff.  The waiters, waitresses, and bartenders all went out of their way to say \"hi\" and make you feel comfortable.  When we had a problem, they resolved quickly it without hesitation.  For this rare treat, I gotta give them a full 5/5 on customer service.",

Their potato and leek soup was delicious and full of fresh perfectly cooked red potatoes and delicately fried leeks.  My husband and I shared their beef shepherd's pie & medium chicken curry.  Both were portions large enough to feed a family of four if you are willing to share.  The chicken curry was made with chicken thighs so you may get an off bite of fat but the tenderness of the chicken and the good heat from the spice will have you fine with it.  The shepherd's pie was my favorite dish.  The beef was melt in you mouth and so abundant in the dish, potatoes and carrots perfectly cooked made this plate so tasty.   I will be returning to try more dishes.  And if it wasn't a Monday afternoon I would have loved to take a stab at trying their extensive beer list!  Well done Piper's Pub.",

This Sunday brunch special is a golden-brown potato pancake folded around a generous pile of eggs, cheese, and sausage. For the best meal, eat it with sides of bacon and horseradish mayo. Round out with a Ploughman's Platter. If you miss brunch, the best bet is to order anything featuring Stilton.  Piper's is the place to go during the off season to get your fix of sports enthusiasm. It's got well-placed TVs, plenty of drink choices (scotch to ease those missed goals/rebounds/TDs) and fans aplenty in International soccer jerseys. Because there's always a game to get excited about.",

They have excellent beers on draft, and humongous plates of UK-style food.  The shepherd's pie is definitely two meals (and therefore worth the price paid).  They also make a good burger, but if you're here, you have to take advantage of the UK dinners.  It's not the same as a pub in the UK (I distinctly remember struggling to find ones that even served food, or had a kitchen open past 6pm), but especially here in Pittsburgh, it's as close as you'll get.  The attitude in the place is generally friendly, I'd say.  The bar area is typically really crowded compared to the dining area, so there is a potential for a little friction there just because you're elbow-to-elbow, but I've had good experiences.  Usually no problem in seating groups of people.  In the dining area it's common to find yourself actually saying a few words to the table next to you just out of friendliness (and some people bring their families to dinner here).  Next time I go, it will be solely for a Smithwick's and scotch eggs.  Oh yeah.",

    "text": "After reading all of the beaming reviews on this place and checking out the (frequently upkept) website, I took my parents here for Sunday brunch.  I got the fish and chips. The fish itself was great, but not as hot and crisp as it could have been. It'd probably been sitting under the lamps for too long. The fries were the same bland frozen fry you'd get at any other restaurant in existence, which was disappointing. My dad really enjoyed his huge open face beef sandwich, and my mom found the banger sandwich bland with too much bread. Mashed potatoes were great, and so was the whiskey gravy.  Everyone's right about the 4 onion soup. Get it. It's amazing. I could've used more cheese crouton, but I'm also a glutton.   I tried a bite of the coleslaw, flavorless. And I think there was something wrong with their tap system when we came in. Our Harp had no head, and neither did the Guinness at the next table. Not okay.   I can appreciate that their website has an updated beer and whiskey list with prices. And that they don't go too far with the theme. And giant portions for reasonable prices. It was a 'miss' this time, but I'd love to come back again and try the shephard's pie or the Guinness stew. Hopefully they can poor a proper pint next time around.",

Well my dad decided on Pipers Pub in the Southside and I'm he did.   The beer alone makes this place worth stopping in, with a wide selection of authentic Irish, Scottish, Welsh, and English beers on draft you are sure to find something you like. Although anything on cask is not good. There is a reason the British Empire fell and it's because they couldn't keep their beer cold. My history teacher may not agree with me but I'm sticking to it.   I even got to see 3 guys in their 50s with bad facial hair, pony tails, and an unsurprising lack of female companions get into a shouting match about who was the leader of their band. Definitely made me feel like I was in a real Irish Pub. As for the food my Guinness Beef Stew was phenomenal. Savory chunks of beef and potatoes cascaded down the sides of the massive Sourdough bread bowl.   The server was probably one of my favorite I've had in a long time. Very personable, I got to know his personality but he wasn't hovering either. Just a very efficient helpful server who helped guide me through the overwhelming amount of beers on draft.  It wasn't until I was walking out I thought I should've gotten a real Black and Tan. Guess I have an excuse to go back and hopefully soon.",

    "text": "Piper's is the Art Garfunkel of Carson Street: it might be the second-best beer bar in the city, but unfortunately sits right across from the best (Fat Head's). It's hardly a runaway, however, as Piper's does enjoy certain advantages over its corpulent neighbor:  1. Four (!) beer engines. It's rare to find a bar that has even one. Fond as I am of cask ale, this is my favorite thing about Piper's.  2. A classier ambiance with a significantly lower bro quotient (brotient?).    3. Generally less crowded, although Piper's is a somewhat smaller space and at times is just as packed.  4. An extensive and reasonably priced spirits list, with an emphasis on Scotch.  5. A more expansive and varied menu, including excellent fries and meat pies from the Pub Chip Shop next door. Food is quite good given the inherent limitations of British cuisine.  While composing this list I realized that Piper's deserves better than the four stars I originally intended to award. Although I still slightly prefer Fat Head's on the strength of their beer list and sandwiches, Piper's is an excellent bar in its own right and merits a fifth star.",

Pipers pub has a lot of what you would call classic British/UK food but there is nothing ordinary or boring about it.  We started off with the scotch eggs and were not disappointed.  We have been to several places to try scotch eggs (my boyfriend's obsessed) but I had never been to a place where they were as big as they sell them here.  They were hot and full of flavor so I was very excited for our entrees.   I order the bangers and mash which according to the restaurant the sausage they use comes from the strip district and it clearly didn't have a frozen/reheated taste to it.  The sausage was very good, and I'm very picky about pork products because they tend to give me a headache but these were delicious.   My boyfriend order the Shepard's pie with lamb meat and chestnuts which was also very good.  Both of these foods, along with many other things on the menu, would be perfect on a cold day.  They were both very hearty foods to warms you up when it's cold outside, but the best is yet to come.  While the restaurant is very good and I would have no problem recommending it to my friends the one thing that sent me over the edge to amazing is their bread pudding.  I really enjoy bread pudding but find that sometimes it can either be too soupy or has no flavor.  Their bread pudding was without a doubt the best bread pudding I can remember ever having.  It was flavorful and had the right combination of moisture without being all soggy.  My boyfriend and I decided to split it but I almost wish I would have gotten my own.    Overall I highly enjoyed piper's pub and WILL be back for more.",

Really like the blend of ingredients, meat was tender, and the sauce that decorated the inside of the pie brought it all together so well. The fluffiness of the Cottage Pie was absolutely unreal ... never have I seen such a fluffy crust for one that literally melted in your mouth as you ate it. Scotch Eggs? A Briton classic ... eggs are fresh, savory (not too salty), and a great way to start a meal. Oh and they have a bar too for those who are interested in alcohol (mostly beers).

Notably, they probably have the cleanest men's room in the South Side. Seriously, its almost like being at home.  I met with a few friends and brought my wife for a happy hour meet up. We stuck to craft beers, all of which were amazing. I will highlight the banana bread ale. I have never seen a banana bread beer in my life nor expected it to taste like anything other than a cocktail. However, it was a perfectly crated beer-tasting ale with a semi-sweet banana bread finish.   We ordered the Shepard's pie, corn beef & cabbage, scotch eggs and bread pudding complete with Dave & Andy's Ice cream. The portions were huge and the wait time was around 10-15 minutes. The food was hot, well-done and very filling. The scotch eggs were phenomenal, especially with a hoppy IPA or lager. The bread pudding was homemade, not overly sweet and just rightly spiced.  I don't remember our server's name (sorry) but it was a lady with a sleeve tattoo. She was wonderful. She told jokes, was very knowledgable about the menu, made excellent recommendations to my wife on beers and worked quickly. Kuddos to her hospitality.   In addition to all the positive things above, the prices are very, very fair.  I don't live in Pittsburgh anymore, but when I visit, Piper's will be up on my list every time.",

For the drinking crowd, come back later to sample the well curated scotch list and/or commendable draft list, or just start your bender early and mingle with the rowdy football crowd! Oleeeee, ole, ole, oleeeee!!!!!",

Ive enjoyed the chicken curry and the meatloaf recently. However, the menu they post on Yelp is not the current one; my waitress said it was several years old, so dont expect to find available many of the items you see in the Yelp menu.",

Eight years later I don't care for soccer any more than I did back then, but the food and atmosphere keep me coming back.   Brunch on Sunday mornings are my favorite. I always get the bangers, scrambled eggs and toast with Earl Grey tea. It's simple, but my absolute favorite. I do also love the Shepard's pie, curry and chips, and bangers and mash. Ooooh and the Irish Boxty!!! Maybe that's my favorite! It's just all so good!   The staff is friendly and always make a point to talk to my husband (who's a regular) and ask about the family. Now with a baby we don't go quite as often, but we can still bring our son for dinner and usually not feel out of place in the South Side.",

FOOD Love the scotch eggs but the cardiologist said to only have these once a decade.  Stilton and Rasher salad is incredible.  Pub burger is the BEST!  Reuben and Fish & Chips are excellent.  Open face roast beef on italian bread covered with a dark/rich whisky onion gravy and a side of half-mashed red potatoes = ultimate comfort food.  So many other great options - you cannot go wrong!  DRINK Love the beer list.  There is a focus on imports but they also have a dozen or so excellent PA craft beers on the list.   This place takes everything that they do seriously - the beer tastes fresh and the lines are clean.  If you are a fan of scotch whiskey, the list at Piper's Pub cannot be beat - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fpiperspub.com%2Fscotch%2F&s=80fb0bf2fa996f5d22b3e50c8127f918624cc92719cf2e4fd4c40513b2ca2aff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">piperspub.com/scotch</a>  SOCCER / FOOTBALL Fans of the beautiful game rejoice - you have found your home at Piper's Pub.  This place is packed during the big games and they get satellite feeds beyond ESPN and Fox Soccer Channel.   Every once in a while, I get my boys out of school early and we throw on the EPL jerseys and we go catch an afternoon game at Piper's Pub with other raving lunatic fans.  This place is worth a 2 hour drive if you are not in the Pittsburgh area.  Definitely deserving of 5 stars.  Love it!",

Football (not the 'Merican kind) fans watching games all morning and afternoon.  You won't feel strange at all about ordering an IPA at 10:00am with your brunch.  Then finish brunch off right with an Irish Coffee.   Also a generally great bar to stop by for a beer most nights (can get a bit crowded on weekends, though).

They are amazing. hard boiled eggs, wrapped in sausage and fried with hot sauce. Awesome. The Bloxty's looked amazing. My girlfriend got the waffle with berries and whipped cream. She loved hers also. We got in there about 11:30. The bar was full with people watching soccer and the back room was half full. Our waitress was very fast and attentive. We'll be back.",

We came here for breakfast on our last trip to the Burgh, and the food was spectacular, very authentic to the UK giant breakfast experience. Everyone here is laid back, there is football (that would be soccer for we Statesiders) on all the TVs, and plenty of drinks to go around. Our last stop was for a mini pub crawl and we got acquainted with their beer list and hung out in the bar, which was not too loud but was ready to get that way. The dining room in the back is definitely quieter, even being right up on the bar area. This is my preferred bar in the Saahside.",

I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of vegetarian/vegan options on the menu which are clearly labeled. I ordered the Seitan Thai Chili Wrap with a side of cottage cheese. Soo yummy! Any restaurant that serves seitan automatically wins my heart.The thai chili sauce was sweet, tangy, and gave the dish a nice kick of spiciness. My boyfriend really enjoyed the Chicken Mushroom Cottage Pie. The super creamy chicken and mushroom stew was complemented by the enormous, flaky puff pastry. I was staring in jealousy as I watched him chow down.   A stop at Piper's definitely prepared me to conquer the day...but maybe a quick nap first.",

The food is amazing. I have never had a bad thing here. I come for the brunch boxty specials (a different special every weekend) and the beer selection, which is plentiful and always includes many local beers. (In case you aren't in the know, boxties are giant potato pancakes, usually stuffed with something. For example, they have a Thanksgiving boxty, which is stuffed with turkey, mashed potatoes, cranberry sauce, and topped with gravy.) Soccer fans will like this place as they show all of the games, and it does get packed, but it's always a fun atmosphere. I highly suggest stopping in for brunch on a Saturday or Sunday.",

They don't take reservations so we had a bit of a wait, but it wasn't too bad.  While waiting near the bar we got a couple of drinks to start off.  I ordered an Irish coffee.  It wasn't bad, but not too memorable.  A little light on the booze and a little too room temperature for my liking.      After our 10 minute wait we were seated.  I had checked over the menu while waiting and a few things caught my eye that I would have liked to try, but in the end I ordered the Irish Breakfast.  It was a bountiful meal served with three eggs, any style, a ham steak, some mash, and two bangers.  Also came with a hard roll, which I changed out for toast.  The bangers and mash were my favorite part of the dish. Our server and other employees were very nice, and considering how busy the place was we didn't wait too long for our food.  After engorging myself, I ordered one more Irish coffee, which seemed even a little weaker than the first.  Piper's is a bit on the loud side, so quiet conversation wasn't happening, more of a speaking loudly over the table.  All in all this was a great and affordable stop.  I will definitely keep it on my rotation for brunch stops.",

We ordered appetizers, which arrived but we didn't have plates.  We try, in vain, to flag down our waitress, but ultimately, one of us got up and had to walk to the bar to ask for plates.  No drink refills, no attention.  Nothing.  The entrees come.  Again, the food tastes great.  However, a burger was ordered with this exact quote \"BYOB burger, medium rare please.  No garnish, no lettuce, no tomato, no pickle... only meat, cheese, and bun.\"  It arrived with full garnish and a pickle.  After sitting with out empty plates for over 15 minutes, we flagged the waitress down for the check.  It was approximately 10 more minutes until the check arrived.  Then, it was another 25 minutes until we gave up and found someone else to take the check.  This is after multiple attempts to flag down our waitress.  I try not to leave bad reviews, but having to get your own plates, getting an incorrect order, never getting refills, and waiting nearly an hour to pay the check is less than ideal.  The orders that were served correctly were great, but the negative experience outweighed the positive.  I don't expect 5-star service from a $15-20 entree restaurant, but I also don't expect to be totally ignored, forgotten, served incorrectly, perform 25%+ of the waitress's tasks and have my time wasted.  The manager or owner did seem sincerely concerned when I expressed displeasure with the service and other servers seemed competent and attentive.  However, my family and I dine out for food, but also for convenience and a relaxing time together.  Such horrendous and inexcusably bad service is not relaxing and it disrupts the flow of conversation.  Personally, I will never return under any circumstances.  If the service had been simply average, I'd probably go there fairly often, but life is too short and there are two many other comparably delicious restaurants that offer far better service.",

    "text": "Piper's is awesome! My fiance and I were in Pittsburgh visiting my sister and she said she had been wanting to try this place for a while so we headed there to get some brunch. Let me just say, the menu at Piper's is ridiculous. Ridiculous in the sense that I literally wanted to try every.single.dish listed. I have never had such a hard time deciding! We all felt that way, so naturally we took a vote and landed a few apps on three dishes we were all interested in.   APPS: Scotch Eggs- I would say these are a go to at Piper's. Cooked perfectly, great flavor and pairs well with the provided hot sauce. One of my favorite items and also a pretty rare item to find, so when I see it, I gotta have it. Curry & Chips- The chips here were good and the curry was packed with flavor. We went with the medium level of spice and it was just right. While I love both parts equally and we ate the whole serving, I don't think I would order this again. Not because I didn't enjoy it, but because I think they offer some other things here that would probably knock your socks off.  MEALS: Shepherd's Pie w/ Beef- Delish, The stock was rich, full of flavor, and went so well with the meat and potatoes. Good dish, but it was my least favorite. The other dishes we tried were just so delicious and unique that this was the only one that actually did not get devoured, so it was the only one that made it home in a doggy bag. English Breakfast w/ eggs done over easy- While I would say this one wasn't my favorite taste-wise, it was one that I died for. It was so unique and full of different ingredients and flavor that every bite offered you something different. I have never really eaten a meal like this before and I enjoyed it so so much.  Corned Beef Boxty- This was the clear brunch winner, agreed upon by the whole table. YUM! Gotta get a boxty when you can. I want this cream sauce one every brunch item I eat for the remainder of my life. INCREDIBLE! BRAVO!  I cannot recommend this place enough. Five stars because the menu is incredible and unique...also---Great location. Great food. Great beer selection. Great service! Cannot wait to come back!",

    "text": "I just moved to South Side Flats for the summer and checked out Piper's Pub for dinner. Overall, the experience was very enjoyable. They offer a good range of drink options and the menu consists of bar food as well as English-inspired fare. I sat at the bar, which is a good spot to grab a drink and watch a game.  I had the shrimp and chips and a lager. The shrimp was perfectly fried; crispy and tender. The fries were delicious too and tasted pretty fresh, although they could've used a little salt. The serving size was very generous and left me satisfied. My roommate ordered the Scottish Eggs which he said were good, but that the eggs were a bit over boiled.  Piper's Pub has a good menu with plenty of options. I'd go back for a drink and a quick bite.",

Fries on salads, scotch eggs, proper English AND Irish brekkies served anytime, Guinness stew, shepherd's and their pies, chicken & mushroom pastry...and, a VEGAN BLACK BURGER. Yes, the geniuses behind Piper's Pub though of just about everyone, even the vegans. Well done, well done. Also, a whole mess of sandwiches, etc.   Yes, the food is excellent enough to stand on its own, but what truly makes this place shine is the service. As soon as we entered we were greeted warmly, equipped with a wifi password (he saw me checking my phone, checking in of course!) without even asking, plus a story to boot (ask the owner about \"Yo Pipes!\"). Waters and hot teas arrived swiftly as did menus. Our lunching partners joined us, we all ordered and from start to finish the service was utterly flawless. We had no less than 3 gentlemen taking orders, delivering food, refilling waters, checking on our happiness, etc. All just seemed to totally have their shit together and like being alive. This is rarity in the biz, these guys got it. This place has roots, and one of them seems to be treating guests like proper guests  And making them wish they'd worn stretchy pants.   On a last second whim, I went with the full English Breakfast. Baked beans, bangers (sausages), 2 eggs over easy and thick cut toast all heaped onto a plate. It arrived in all of its glory, HOT, delicious and exactly what I wanted. It kept me full for approximately 9 hours (the entire drive to NYC) and I consumed about 1/4 of it. This stuff is for REAL. I'd say you might want to think about sharing plates due to the huge portions, but the food is so darned good I just recommend ordering your own and taking home leftovers. It's worth it.   The lunch hour was a comfortable busy and I left with a warm, fuzzy feeling. Yes, I was full...but really, Piper's is the bomb. Yo Pipes! Indeed.   HUGE lunch for 4, no booze + tip: $60.",

It was pretty good, as were the brussels sprouts and mac & cheese that came on the side. The portion was huge, but I was still tempted by the bread pudding for dessert, and it was AMAZING. It came with lots of raisins and was perfectly moist all the way through.  It looks like it would be a fun spot to grab a drink on the weekends too, and I've heard great things about the brunch.

Frequently I'd get home from work and smell the curry... that would send me scurrying over to get an order of Curry & Chips (fries) to go.  The food is almost always excellent.  I've only had one bad experience, but the manager went way above and beyond to make it right.  Out of countless dozens of times eating there, one bad experience can easily be chalked up to everyone has a bad day once in a while.  What have we eaten there?  We love the Ploughman's Platter.... cheeses, gherkins, apples, bread and chutney... the chutney is AWESOME.  Other favorites are the above mentioned Curry & Chips... also the Scotch Eggs.   My son loves the chicken fingers.   The Gaelic Four Onion Soup is always delicious.  One of their specials was a Seafood Bisque that was out of this world.  The house salad is always crisp and fresh.  The burgers always rock... as well as the Reuben, Smoked Turkey, Rachel, English Dip.  Irish Breakfast, English Breakfast, Bangers & Mash, Guinness Stew, Cottage Pie,  Beef or Chicken Shepherd's Pie... all awesome.  Bacon Wrapped Filet... always cooked to perfection... Stilton Stuffed Chicken... yum...   I just noticed I haven't tried the pork chops... Jameson onion gravy... frittered parsnips and mashed root veggies... must try next visit!!  All of the portions are very hearty.  Even the kids menu boast very hearty servings of Shepherd's Pie and Cottage Pie.  They have a great beer & scotch selection.  If you get over there for breakfast or brunch... the Boxtys rock... so does the Belgian French Toast.  There's also usually not much of a wait for a table.    Piper's seems to be a well kept secret!",

    "text": "How did we not know about this place?! A great selection of brew is just an added bonus to the Irish influenced cuisine offered at Piper's Pub. Located in the heart of the Southside, this is a hidden gem in the mist of many eateries in the area. What we ordered: Seafood cakes - very good and freshly made. They were very filling and were complimented with a small side salad. The smoked chicken wings got no complaints and were devoured by our son who claims to be the wing connoisseur. The goat cheese stuffed poppers were very tasty and an appy we would definitely order again. I only wish they would have had more sauce with them because it added a wonderful flavor. So do yourself a favor and ask for extra sauce. But the star of the night was the fresh fried fish. I have to say it was one of the best fish sammies we have had in the Burg! We can't wait to go back and try some other dishes, but the fish is a must do for us again!",

This is not your \"college student\" venue on the Southside, so you don't have to worry about being bombarded with the drunks.  Its a nice break away from the Carson Street Crazies.  Whether you're in there for a pint, bangers and mash, or to catch a game (there's always some form of sports on the TVs), you'll be yet another satisfied customer and come back again and again.

We came here for my birthday back in June, and I was pretty pumped to get the shepherd's pie since I became pretty obsessed with it in London and previous reviews said they had good stuff here. It was a huge portion, and I was surprised by how big was. The flavor, however, was bland and nothing like I expected. My partner in crime had bangers and mash and had no complaints. The experience was so-so, and without a flavorful shepherd's pie to lure me in, I don't think we'll be back. I was really hoping for an authentic shepherd's pie, but alas, didn't find it here.",

    "text": "I have heard good things about this place so I had to give it a try. My friends and I went there for lunch and got seated right away. We received our drinks and ordered promptly. That's about the last thing that happened promptly.   Our food took about 30-45 minutes to come out and once we finished, in a hurry to get back to work, we had to wait a good 20-30 minutes to get the check. It seemed we were on the tale end of lunch so everyone was running around doing other things other than getting our check so we can get out. Lunch from sitting down to leaving was more than 1.5 hrs which is a little long in my opinion.  Okay now that I got that out of my system let me say that I had the Open Face Roast Beef Sandwich and it was the best open face gravy soaked sandwich I have ever had. The roast beef was tender and soft and the gravy had a really good flavor.   They had a very good beer selection and they have the largest selection of Scotch I have ever seen. It's impressive! To say the least.   The downside to pipers is that the selection and good food comes at a cost. They rarely have specials or good happy hour specials so be prepared to pay full price for everything on tap and on the menu.   I give them 4 Stars despite their service because I feel the poor service was a fluke and their beer and Scotch selection is pretty epic. That combined with the delicious food and it's a winning combination.",

I love that they have 5-6 beers on cask. There is enough variety to please beer drinkers of all shapes and sizes.  So, why the 3 stars? Oh, because it took 90 minutes for our food to come. It got pretty frustrating watching people sit down after us, eat, and pay the bill as we sat and twiddled our thumbs. We actually didn't twiddle- we drank. And got drunk before the food came. Classy.  Our server was a nice dude- he took 10% off the bill... but I'm pretty sure he forgot to put our food in.  Ultimately, I WILL be back because this place is the cutest. I am sure I'll have a better experience next time.",

The barman asked for I.D, he showed him his UK and Canadian driving licenses and several other documents, the barman kept saying it had to be either an in-state driving license or a passport (who brings out their passport for a drink?). The point of asking for I.D is to avoid underage drinking - my friend was clearly overage and had several forms of I.D, so being turned away was ridiculous. It was the middle of the day and we hadn't been drinking so it's not like the barman was trying to avoid trouble.

Sadly, Both my friend and I were highly disappointed in the food and service.   When we arrived there was a small wait. The host was kind and inviting which was nice. Once we were seated it seemed to go down hill quick. Our server was nice, but the service was horrible. In addition, my appetizer was completely overcooked. My friend didn't like that her scotch eggs came with hot sauce (I liked the hot sauce on my food). Our entrees were good, but mine was rang in incorrectly and they first brought out \"beef\" instead of \"vegan\"...... once I got it..... it tasted fine.",

Was shocked but so happy to realize their food menu has SO many vegan options. Very extensive menu and I've heard nothing but good things about their food. They've got the staple Irish dishes of fish and chips and Sheppard's pie, to name a few. Also on the menu - vegan Sheppard's pie! It was recommended to me one day by several patrons at the bar and it did not disappoint! Huge serving, I barely made a dent, all the veggies and potatoes were cooked perfectly in a delicious sauce. They also have house made seitan wings with vegan ranch - those were just so-so. Other options include house made hummus with pita & veggies, veggie burger, Banh mi, vegan grilled cheese, etc. Tons of options on the menu, love it! The bar has several flat screen TVs and the staff has always been great. Great spot!",

    "text": "My family and I were planning to eat that night in Oakland but when we got to the area we realized it was the Greek food festival and there was absolutely NO WHERE to park! We had to make a quick decision on where to go next so we decided to just start driving toward the Southside. On yelp I found Pipers pub and became very excited about the menu, just from the appetizer list so that's where we decided on. I had said previously that night that I didn't want to go anywhere dark and loud, so it was ironic that the place I was so exited to eat at was just that. The bar and dining area were both very crowded with people and the lack of light was made up for in decibels of noise. However, throughout the night either we all just got used to it or the noise levels went down and the lights came up. Either way, it didn't prove to be an issue. The first thing to come out was a bowl of corn chowder I ordered which was absolutely phenomenal! Don't order this dish if you don't like spice. The corn was very sweet, the soup creamy, the potatoes chunky, and the jalapeno bacon jam was hot!! The jam pooled right under the surface of the chowder and appeared after my first investigative spoonful like I was discovering and Easter egg lovingly placed in the grass for a child to find! The different levels of flavor and varieties of consistency throughout the chowder made it a fun and complex sensation. I scraped the bowl clean. We have a theory in my family that if the soup is good then the food will be too and that proved True at Piper's. I ordered the Wild Scotsman burger which was juicy and cooked to perfection, the bacon jam was as good on the burger as it was in the soup and the brie provided the burger with a richer taste. My mom ordered the Pub Steak & Chips which also came with a fresh vegetable. The steak was cooked exactly to her liking, juicy and had a great grilled flavor that also was apparent in the zucchini, which even I, a disliked of zucchini, found myself eating and even wanting more of. My cousin ordered the Pub salad with chicken which she very much enjoyed and ate in its entirety. We all had chips (fries) that were thick and potato-y but also had a very crisp and crunchy fried outer shell, which I once thought were mutually exclusive. They may have been some of the best fries I've had. I ordered a vindaloo curry sauce on the side to dip my chips in. They had chips in vindaloo sauce as an option for an appetizer and the bowl of sauce they brought out for me was very large so I figured I would be charged extra as I have been in the past, however when the check arrived I was surprised and delighted that the curry had been free! Throughout the entire night the staff was kind, friendly, and attentive, and before the night was over I was already making plans to go back! Next time I'll be sure to get one of the delicious looking desserts from their menu! Also if you're not in the mood or have the time to sit down and eat a meal, they have a fish and chip shop next store that serves a lot more than just fish and chips!",

The bacon jam adds a delicious sweet flavor to enhance the soup. Another favorite of mine is the Shepherd's Pie! The potatoes on top are browned nicely and the flavor is mouth-watering.   You can't go wrong with finding something hearty to eat here.",

We have only been here a handful of times, but have loved everything about it each time. Awesome and unique options on the menu (Boxtys!!) and a better beer selection than most places in the city.   They keep their draft list updated with full detail so there is no guessing- but the bartenders will answer questions for you should you have any.  Definitely come hungry, because the portions aren't messing around. Also, opt for dessert. We got the chocolate pudding pot (not the correct name, but you'll know what it is) and OMG. Goodbye waistline, hello happiness.  The SouthSide isn't my fave place to hang out nowadays, but Pipers makes it worth a trip down.",

It was a very satisfactory crunchy meal. I also tried the salmon and chips, which comes with some kind of pea mush as well. There are less pieces of salmon for the same price, but it does taste better. I think if I came next time I'd just get that - I'd definitely still find that amount satisfying in one meal!  One bad point was that when I came they definitely seemed understaffed. The place was packed but I only saw two servers. Our food took almost an hour to come out. I would still return because their fish and chips was good, and the issue with staffing seems a temporary problem that would be easy to solve.",

    "text": "Piper's Pub has become apart of my weekend routine. Almost every Sunday we go there for brunch. I'm not much of a creature of habit when it comes to ordering but I do love getting the Irish breakfast. The meal comes with bangers, mash, ham, eggs, tomatoes and a roll. It sounds like too much food and it is. However, it is delicious and I usually make way more of a dent in it than expected.   Another highlight would be the chicken, biscuits and sausage gravy. The chicken is fried perfectly and the biscuits are fluffy but dense. I would probably order it every time I go but I do like staying the weight of a normal human so I resist it as often as I can.  The service is also excellent! We have never had to wait too long for food and my coffee cup is never empty. I guess the only reasons why I wouldn't give Piper's 5 stars is because the beers are pretty pricey and Mark Madden is always there for brunch....I'm kidding about Madden...kind of. Other than that, pretty perfect!",

I haven't been here for a little over a year until last night.   I got the same thing as always but it tasted very different.   The gravy tasted different, the carrots were undercooked and the chicken was different and much more chunky.   My husband had the fish and chips and it was excellent.   He usually gets the beef shepherds pie but we noticed it now says it's the Guinness stew and we are afraid it won't be the same as it used to be. We will still come here but I'll probably never get the shepherds pie again.   Disappointed that it's different now.",

I went here for the England v Sweden World Cup game with my mum and had an absolute blast - while enjoying sausage rolls and chips and gravy before noon!  Since England did well in the Cup this year, we were in line outside at 7:45 a.m. along with a group of other Brits in the 'Burgh! The place was packed as soon as they opened the doors. We got lucky enough to snag a seat at the bar. There was one bar tender on - for a massive group of probably 125+ of us - and he blew me away. We had a drink in front of us at all times (and before you judge for drinking at 8 a.m.... ENGLAND WAS GOING TO THE SEMIS!!!).   Service was impeccable, even with a bunch of football-crazed Englishmen shouting orders.   It was one of the best days and best \"meals\" I've had in years. I almost felt like I was home! I definitely have to go back for a sit down meal soon!",

What I appreciate about this place is they have more for obnoxious vegans such as myself than just a salad or a veggie burger.  I'm not a damn rabbit and can make a better veggie burger than most places.   That being said, GET THE VEGGIE BURGER.  Their house made \"cheese\" is so tasty, add BBQ sauce for pro points.  Start EVERY meal with their seitan.  It's hands down, the best I have ever had...coast to coast, without question.   VEGAN SHEPHERD'S PIE??!  WHAT DELICIOUS UNIVERSE AM I IN??!  Everything is perfectly cooked, properly seasoned, and they have so many options without being overwhelming.   All of my carnivore friends have raved about their burgers and other meat dishes.  I was too busy inhaling my food to care what anyone says to me, but the gist is that they dug their food.   Service is always great, even if you get confused by the twin sister babes working there...like me, because I'm an idiot.    The ONLY bummer about this place is the location.  That's because I'm old and hate dealing with south side bar idiots.  Ignore the morons and woo girls outside, hide in here and order everything.  If you're disappointed, there's something wrong with your mouth.",

For dinner, I ordered the cottage pie (which our waitress said we could trade out the chicken for lamb or beef) and came with a humongous pastry puff on top.  It was soo good and they give you so much food I had enough to eat and also some leftover for a nice lunch the next day.  Michelle, our waitress, was super-very friendly and attentive and food was delicious.  They have a happy hour special from 5-7 $2 off any draft (they have tons of beer here).  I guess it's super busy when they have soccer games - thankfully it was all clear on a Monday night.    Will definitely be back - heard their brunch and Sunday supper are both great - there were tons on their menu I want to try - looking at the brisket mac n cheese for next time.",

One time I was with a group that waited almost 40 minutes for food, when the place was half empty. Buuuuuuut in my experience that's the exception.  The norm, for me at least, is that Piper's Pub is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh. If you know me, you won't be very surprised by this. Piper's is home to British/Irish inspired food, a variety of whiskeys, mead...and, well, plenty of other alcoholic beverage options, seeing as it's a pub. Want lunch? They've got you covered (drinking optional, although resisting their delectable won't be easy). Ready for dinner? Stop on it. Looking for Scotch eggs on a Sunday morning or afternoon? Brunch is waiting for you.  In addition to offering lots of pub-inspired fare throughout the day, the food that comes out of Piper's kitchen is, well, mouth watering. Piper's Pub - and its side project next door, the Chip Shop - are each one of the places I trust to make lovely British-inspired food in general. More importantly, I trust them to make fish and chips that I will enjoy; traveling to England admittedly ruined a lot of the fish and chips made in the U.S. for me. Having a local place to go for tasty fish and chips inspired by Britain's recipes and cooking, rather than Americanized ones, is a pretty awesome thing to me.  Add in attentive staff, and you have a line-up that I can't really complain about. Be advised that reservations are a no-go here, and the place can get busy, particularly for dinner and brunch. You'll definitely give yourself plenty of time to stop in and enjoy any meals and drinks at Piper's Pub. Don't worry: based on my experience, it'll be worth it!",

Our server was knowledgeable and able to answer questions.

Desserts did not disappoint either.  The chocolate pot de creme was rich and decadent.   The menu is extensive, servings  are generous, service was excellent, and the atmosphere was pub worthy.

A few others at the table also had the Strip steak & loved it. A couple had Burgers which were huge, cooked perfectly as well. They commented their burgers were amazing. Only one guest had an issue with their meal of corned beef & cabbage. There was a ton of cabbage & good mashed potatoes but very little corned beef. I mentioned something to the server & she apologized & immediately offered another meal option. We were done eating so the guest declined. They took her meal off of the bill & offered her a meal to take away. She declined as she felt they more than took care of the situation. We were really very pleased with the service & other than the lack of corned beef, it was an awesome dining experience. Great pub, great food, great service!!!  Will definitely be her again when in Pittsburgh.",

The beau and I were driving around this Pittsburgh neighborhood like tourists and had no idea what we were going to find. After driving past a few uninteresting places, we decided to park and just walk.   That's when we saw Piper's Pub. As soon as I walked in I felt comfortable. We sat at the nearest high-top table and ordered some beers. I think the only complaint I have about this place is how long they took to get to us. I know that great beer takes time to settle and True 'tenders wait, but I felt like they were making them from scratch.   Honestly though, that one issue wasn't enough for me to think badly of this great pub. As I scrolled the menu for something to eat I was tempted by all the rich, authentic Irish pub grub. Umm, can I haz mashed potatoes plz? Sorry, Cara... no. Instead I ordered their hot turkey sandwich and it was delish! Jason ordered the salmon 'wich and was equally satisfied with his choice.   So, thanks again Yelp iphone app and yelpers. You've once again steered a tourist in the right direction. Feel free to utilize my reviews if you're ever in the CLE area. :-D",

    "text": "Ate dinner here this evening with some coworkers ( I am from out of town).  Several of my coworkers highly recommended Piper's Pub and for good reason.  While there are several commendable qualities, the best by far was the meal.  I had the Guinness Beef Stew; it was awesome.  The beef was mouth melting tender.  The crusty brioche bun was soft in the inside and soaked up the stew flavors nicely.  It is an English pub so the place is noisy but in a good way.  It is old school pub atmosphere...very nice.  Dinner was very reasonably priced...paid $10 for the beef ste....it was easily worth $13 to $15.",

    "text": "Pipers Pub is amazing! My only complaint is that I wish they took reservations. My husband and I ate here with 4 other adults. All 6 of us loved our dinners. The alcohol list offered a nice selection and they allow you to sample any of the draft beers. The double chocolate stout was quite yummy. We ordered an appetizer of bangers ($7) and they were pieces of sausage served inside a flakey croissant type roll. We got 4 of them and they were served with a dipping sauce. We shared them and everyone enjoyed them. For my meal I ordered from their \"seasonal\" list and had \"pie and mash\" ($12). It was a chicken pot pie with a buttery flakey crust served on top of mashed potatoes and gravy. It was clear that every item on this dish was homemade and not frozen. It was freaking delicious! All 6 of us left full and pleased with the overall experience. We look forward to going back.",

While they have all of your british classics (and they're all excellent, at that), they also have plenty of delicious vegan/vegetarian options for the non-meat eaters and overall a pretty well-rounded menu.  I went with a friend who's vegan the last time I came, and she got some sort of thai seitan wrap, which was absolutely excellent!  Very impressed.",

They were surprising good, 6 super big beer-battered shrimp served with yummy French fries.  I loved my meal.  The ever most adventuresome BJ ordered Corned Beef and Cabbage.  It was perfected cooked, the cabbage was the correct about of doneness.  Yes, I sampled BJ's meal.    We shared a Bread Pudding for dessert.  It was made from Italian bread.  It was served overly hot, but it was delicious.  We will definitely be back for another try.",

Previous times were either slow service or mediocre food but this was a complete lack of service all together during a non-peak hour on a Friday evening. We sat at a table and never acknowledged after exactly 22 minutes. Not a hello, not be right with you, just nothing all while watching 2 servers and a bartender chat, do dishes, and whatever else possible other than offer drinks and menus. The only person who spoke to us was the door man checking IDs but there were only 3 bar guests and 3 other tables. No excuse for this terrible service and lack of acknowledgement. All I can think of is either weak attention span to the possibility of new customers or some sort of arrogance where the customers are expected to just know some abnormal procedure to get service. The beer variety is ok, but otherwise nothing special. Next time I'll pass.",

Although the chips came crispy, after only about 10 minutes (or the time it took to eat the fish) their exterior became really soft.  I also had a chance to try their beer cheese starter, which was alright. It was strangely lacking salt besides consisting mostly of cheese. I added some salt from the table and some hot sauce and it turned out okay. It wasn't bad to begin with but definitely needed something.  They also have a pretty extensive list of beers and spirits.",

    "text": "Recently went here for the Liverpool v Tottenham match and it was a very immersive experience. I'm not too much of a soccer guy but some of my friends are and figured I would tag along. Let me just start off by saying, although its located in Southside, I was expecting to walk out of the front door and see the cars driving on the wrong side of the road. Having been to London and frequented lots of the pubs there, I can definitely say that Pipers really captures the authentic British pub experience.   The day I went it was absolutely packed and the staff seemed like they were really working hard to accommodate everyone. My friends and I squeezed our way to the back past the bar and put our names in for a 5 person table, to which the host told us the wait would be about 45 minutes. In the meantime we looked at the beer list, which had a pretty good selection, and ordered some drinks (somewhat pricey at around $7.25 for most beers). We ended up getting sat in about 20 minutes and ordered food pretty quickly. I got the reuben which was delicious and definitely reminded me of being back in London with family. I would definitely recommend going hungry as the portions are usually pretty big! Although the place was packed and the staff seemed very frantic the service was great and the food came out very quickly.   This was my first time at Pipers and I will definitely be back very soon. I love the feel of the bar, the size of the food, variety of the menu, and the friendliness of the staff. The only downside I would mention would be the cost, at around $7.25 for a beer and the average price for an entree being $13-15 it can add up quickly, especially if you're there with friends to grab a drink. All in all I am definitely going to recommend this place to my friends and cant wait to bring my (very english) dad to try it out!  P.S. if you are going anytime soon, don't be alarmed that every tap has a HRD WTR tap (a brand of alcoholic seltzer water), it's just an April fools prank they were playing on the customers as the time!",

I am amazed at how they keep the place moving so smoothly.   Piper's food is pure comfort food. The perfect pairing with a pint (or several). Don't go in looking for a light meal. Everything is large, filling and delicious.   During my last visit I ordered the baked brie and the lunch special (as well as a few beers). The lunch special (whose name escapes me) was a fried chicken sandwich with bacon and spicy aioli. It was MASSIVE. The chicken was tender and moist, but with a crispy breading - which paired well with everything else. The bake brie was my real favorite - ooey gooey and melty brie inside a pastry crust served with bread and honey apple slices. Perfection.   My only gripe is the awkward setup - the bar is right in front with the traditional seating in the back. This means when Piper's is busy I have to squeeze past the bar to get to the seating, which is awkward. But this is easily worth it for the rest.",

They have daily specials which is nice, today was a $5 Fuller's London Pride to get you in the British spirit. As a packed pub, I wouldn't expect great service and it met that expectation, the service was pretty spotty. I figured I had to go with the fish and chips, I thought they were pretty average. It was a huge portion of fish but they weren't really crispy which is generally what I like most about fish and chips. They kind of fell apart on me and were pretty messy. At $16, I thought it was little on the pricier side as well. I'd try something else next time. Overall, a decent place in the not so decent South Side.",

The 3rd time we went, was a busy Saturday night... the food came out quickly but wasn't as good as our other experiences.  The seitan was soooo hard and not great, my salmon was so undercooked I thought it would swim away, and my husband's veggie burger (which was the consistency of tuna salad) was a sloppy mess. We got a price of the almond cake with raspberry filling which was the only good thing from our meal.  It was such a bummer. We said we were glad it wasn't our first time there.   We will be back, just not on a weekend evening.  I wish the zucchini boxy (not sure that's spelled right) was offered all the time because I could live on that alone.",

Everyone is very friendly, the staff and the other diners.  I got the fried chicken with biscuits and sausage gravy and can I say that I've never tasted anything so delicious... I was expecting just some plain chicken tenders but they were huge pieces of chicken, fried to perfection! Everything was super delicious, I have zero complaints about the food.  Our server was also 10/10. Even with the restaurant being super busy for the World Cup game, he made sure to check in with us periodically and was extremely friendly!! Some of the people in our party took a little bit of time to order and he was patient and polite the entire time, it's a shame I didn't get his name so that he gets he recognition he deserves!  All in all, I would love to come back to Piper's. Not just for the soccer, but for the food as well.",

I would rank the flavor of the Vindaloo something that you just take time with eating because you are enjoying the flavor. Although honestly we ended up eating the burger with a fork -- it worked out better that way., but overall it was a flavorful surprise.   The Arancini was decent and the hummus was good minus the baby carrots -- omg can someone pleas rid this world of the baby carrot -- I know it's easy but those things should be outlawed.   The portions were very large and the bartender was great and seemed pretty knowledgeable about the beer selection. It was quiet enough that night for conversation without yrll -- I can only imagine sitting there on a cold and snowy night with a friend would be a great way to spend the evening.",

They have now added to their menu both vegetarian and vegan entrees.  I love Shepherd's pie and was amazed that they had a vegan counterpart to it. Instead of mashed potatoes on top they use vegan cauliflower smash. The food came out super hot but was tasty and plenty of it for a whole meal. Inside are vegetables and beans. A small roll with butter accompanies it.  The meal is quite filling and more so healthy for you. I was very impressed with the stew ingredients. Prices are reasonable for a lunch meal but they do have a more elaborate menu which include appetizers, burgers, grilled cheese, and even brunch on the weekend. The menu is clearly marked if you are looking for something in particular.  Gluten free items are also available. Located next to the Pub Chip shop in the Southside metered street parking is available.",

The coffee we had for an early soccer match was not great, but I guess that is somewhat expected for a sports bar.   Overall, great place to go to watch a match.

I stopped in on a Saturday night for the (extensive) Scotch selection but stayed for the Chicken and Mushroom Cottage Pie. If it's any indication of the rest of their traditional British menu, I don't know why you'd go anywhere else. It was flavorful, filling, and all around delicious.  Bartender Cortney knows his Scotch, too, which is very helpful considering their gigantic selection. They have half of their back bar dedicated to single-malt goodness.  It's also worth noting that, for a South Side Saturday night, the place was not packed and filled with the usual stereotypes. It is largely a restaurant, of course, but the environment is very classy. Seems like it might keep the annoying crowds at bay a little.  All said, I wish I could live here. I'll be back.",

Many times, I want to try the new stuff on the Seasonal side of the menu, but it's hard to overcome my need for the chicken mushroom cottage pie. I also want an excuse to get something on a bap (they're delicious too!) but...chicken and mushrooms and puff pastry...  My husband finds the whiskey flights fun and interesting too. Good job on Piper's for having a cheat sheet to go with them, since a grouping of multiple samples can get a bit \"Oh this one's good! What was the name of this one? Shoot, I kinnnnd of remember the waiter said--\"   Make sure to bring ID with you if you're coming late, you get carded at certain times even if you're only eating dinner since the bar is in the front.",

Their Irish Boxty is one of the best breakfasts I've ever had in my life and the atmosphere is great. Oh and the Bloody Marys are delicious! When you step into Piper's Pub off Carson Street it feels to me like you've stepped into an actual Irish pub. Everyone is there to eat great food, have a good brew, and to watch the soccer games. A lot of the patrons are appropriately dressed in their favorite soccer team attire and it can get pretty rowdy when a good game is going which I think only adds to the greatness of this place. The staff are friendly, helpful, and really seem to enjoy their jobs. I can't wait to visit for lunch or dinner someday soon. I highly recommend Piper's Pub....definitely one of the best spots in the 'burgh!",

They have a great draft selection for those of you who, like me, are craft beer fans. last visit,my boyfriend ordered the Lamb&smoked chestnut sheperd's pie. He said the chestnuts were excellent-smoky and savory. You could tell it was finished being made and then immediately served because he could not even touch his plate for the first ten minutes as the food was so hot!Being on a salmon kick lately, I ordered the smoked salmon boxty. The boxty was comparable to the size of my head and was very yummy! The dill sauce complimented the smoky flavor of the salmon as well as the potato pancake holding the bundle of deliciousness together. I noticed how nearly everyone besides the two of us had a bloody mary in front of them so of course i had to try one! I asked for light on the spice, however, it is a premade blend so the bartender added extra tomato juice for me, which made it perfect! Other winning dishes we have tried include the stilton chicken, the salmon club bap, the smoked salmon wrap, and the smoked salmon BLT. If we are ever in need of a place to go where we know we will enjoy our food Piper's is it!",

For instance, if your thing is waking up at 8am on a Saturday to stand around a bar and watch Premiership matches until 2pm, you probably already know, there's no better place to do so in Pittsburgh.  If you're at home on the South Side, you'll enjoy the vibe here. Personally, for a British-style pub, I'd like the entire place to have as much character as its entryway. Throw in some drab green carpet and trough-style urinals if that's what it takes.  The pub fare here is good as well. The portions they dole out are substantial which is great if your hungry/hungover -- as many tend to be -- but overwhelming and potentially disastrous if you're of the mind to moderate your consumption. I've eaten here a handful of times, but nothing has stuck out to me enough to comment on specifically.",

I am in love with food \"from across the pond\" and have had a difficult time finding a place that accurately portrays the differences between Americanized and genuine English cuisine. I had a very difficult time picking just one entree to eat from the extensive menu, after all, who could pick a favorite child from a full brood. This was also one of the few places within the past year that I actually got excited over trying. The server is very witty, loves his job, had answers to any questions we had, and is Irish. LOVE that accent!   The Scotch eggs (I won't describe this palate teaser as many reviewers below describe them accurately) were amazing! Our server explained that they are also served for breakfast with maple syrup. I so badly want to try this breakfast staple and maybe catch a football game (aka soccer to us Yanks) .   I ordered the \"Toad in a Hole\" as described on the menu : Four fresh Local bangers (English sausage) in Yorkshire pudding baked golden brown and covered in our Jameson onion gravy. I can't even find the words to describe how tasty this was! I even had to take some of this home to finish later. The best way to describe the baked Yorkshire pudding is like the thin dough used to wrap a hot dog when making pigs in a blanket, light and airy and crispy. Darren ordered the Shepard's pie with lamb, and OMG, as a Shepherd's pie lover, this was the best I have EVER tasted! I can't wait to go back and try more things! When asked about the unique flavors, our server told us the chef uses sage to flavor the bangers and Shepherd's pie. I think I want to name my first daughter sage!",

Not being from the area, I wanted a great place where the atmosphere reminds me of the Isles. I was not disappointed.   Piper's Pub is the kind of bar my Irish friends would walk into and feel like home. The whiskey bottles are too numerous to count, the beer list is extensive, and the food doesn't get more authentic. On the front window, a time sheet of football games is always listed - I only regret not being there on a game day to cheer on one of my clubs. The Shepherd's Pie was perfectly done with lamb, which is the only way it should be done. For the non-alcohol crowd, there is an actual draft root beer. The bartender was extensively knowledgable of his entire menu. And the best part? Bud Light and Miller Lite were not on tap, and I'm certain that the bartender would tell anyone that ordered one to either drink a real beer or get the hell out.   I'm not from Pittsburgh, but this place would be the perfect excuse to stop in on a road trip.",

Typically when you read reviews about this great pub, there's mention of soccer and soccer fans, but don't let that fool you. Piper's has an excellent selection of beers, and I mean really excellent. You have traditional ales and bitters from the UK and local craft beers, too. Prices are reasonable, too. The food is what you'd expect from a pub. We had some incredible deep fried tempura encrusted hard boiled eggs. What a base that is when you're getting ready to enjoy a few pints. Super clean, good bathrooms, and pleasant service. And I'll add this: the service is not like a lot of places in the area where you need to be pierced to be cool and get good service. Not full of pretensions -- and that's a plus.",

Piper's is the kind of place you can find refuge at 11pm on a Friday or Saturday night from the chaos that is the South Side.  Walk in, grab a seat at the bar, and have a conversation at a reasonable volume with your good friends over a fantastic draft selection.  If you're hungry, you're in for a treat.  Try anything on the \"over the pond\" section of the menu, and you're sure to be pleased.  On the rare occasion I gain the courage to move past the Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepard's Pie, the Guinness Stew and the Bangers and Mash both present delicious alternatives.

My Shepherd's Pie was fantastic, topped by this flakey, beautiful carb-thing that made the dish. Boyfriend said his bangers and mash was lackluster, but I tried it and I called him a liar.  Just needed salt.  I ordered a fancy sounding stout and was disappointed to reach the limits of my ability to blend into the Irish dining experience - it was much too bitter and dark for me.  I wasn't able to finish it, but I'm still glad I tried it.  We went when it was pretty busy, and I would've loved to ask the waiter questions about the beer, but he was running around like a crazy man.

    "text": "Coming from an Irish family, I was a bit questioning about a British Isles themed restaurant actually having decent food (sorry Nana). But this place is seriously delicious, and has a good selection of a wide variety of food that just about everyone should be able to find something to eat (not as many vegetarian options but they're certainly available and just as great). The plates are a bit expensive but certainly worth every penny for how much you get and the quality of food, and the sandwiches are around $9 or so and are also big enough for two meals most of the time.  this pub is a nice little oasis in the middle of the hell that is Carson Street at night. One of the bartenders, a guy from Ireland, really knows his whiskey and walked me through a pretty good taster of various Irish whiskeys that are hard to find in stores and especially in other local bars. Another time, a different bartender took my fiance downstairs to show him the casks in the basement and how the whole cask beer thing works. Everyone else who works there, from dishwashers to waitstaff and everyone in between, is very friendly which makes for a real CHEERS feeling, a real pub.  This is a really fantastic place to go to celebrate something with good food and good drinks (their beer selection is somewhat small, but there's always something good on tap, and all beers I think are $5.37 or something close to that, which is a fair price for most of their selection), or to just come in and relax with a pint after a long day.  The Plowman's Platter (an appetizer) is an impressive spread of cheeses, and the only think that might actually be *too much* is the Scotch Eggs, which are worth trying but are pretty crazy.",

Yet they had only one Scots beer on tap (cold Belhaven - should be room temperature) and lots of beers that had nothing to do with any part of the UK. Like the food:  The \"taste of the British Isles\" included such well known British specialties as Seitan Thai Chili Wrap crispy fried seitan, Mediterranean Vegan Burger and Salmon Taco Wrap.

The decor was nothing like a UK pub, and not enhanced by 7 TVs showing 3 different stations, and the cafe bit at the back looks dingy and unappealing, despite festooning the walls with Boots prints of \"typical\" British scenes.

    "text": "Meh.  I'm probably spoiled by The Rover in Louisville and from working in the UK, but I was underwhelmed by Piper's.    Ambiance: They stole the interior of a Denny's to make the place - lots of plywood on the walls in a cheap attempt to simulate wood paneling, and lots of vinyl seating.  Kinda looks like no one involved in decorating this place has ever seen a picture of a Scottish pub.  Hey, I recognize that it's the closest you'll get in Pittsburgh, but that doesn't mean you get points for doing a good job.  If you're running a faux-Scottish/English/Welsh/Irish pub, the ambience is half of the game.  The rest of the it is having good beers and reasonably cheap, hearty comfort food/pub fare.  (Heads up for my review of the food: they fail that part, too.)  N.B. They don't put English mustard in the tacky beer carton of condiments on the table; I had to ask for it.  (I should've asked for brown sauce (HP sauce) just to see if they had any.  I'm betting not.)  Food:  The entree (toad-in-the-hole) tasted okay, but it was drowned in canned/instant gravy.  I'm happy there's a place here that serves toad-in-the-hole, but it's hardly worth the $16 they charge for it.  (Come on!  It's just four sausages buried in Yorkshire pudding.  It's easier to make than a burger; there's no way it should be over $10.)  The Scotch eggs, at a more reasonable $8, were way overcooked, i.e., burned, and they serve them with Texas Pete hot sauce instead of English mustard.    Service: so-so - the usual, slightly unfriendly service that's the norm for Pittsburgh, but I wouldn't say it was bad.  The hostess was friendly.",

    "text": "This is a English/Scottish hyrbrid pub with a tad bit of Irish thrown in.  I am a huge fan of bangers and mash and so I couldn't wait to try out everything.  The hosts and servers were great and we were promptly seated.  There is a fairly new, clean interior that is split into a bar section and a dining section with some overlap depending on the group and what they are looking for.  I liked the atmosphere.  After perusing the menu, we settled on the following items:  Gaelic four onion soup Scotch eggs Open faced roast beef Bangers and mash Draft Rootbeer  The Onion soup is NOT a French onion soup.  It is its own entity with its own ingredients and flavors.  Over time, I have learned to just expect a French onion knock-off when it comes to onion soup.  Kudos to Piper's Pub for doing something different.  There is a large crouton with stilton baked into it.  It tastes quite good with the soup.  My only issue with the soup was the onions -- they were not completely tender.  Is it possible to have the onions in the soup cooked a little longer to completely soften them up? I know this is a personal preference and I would probably order the soup again but I would only consume the broth.    While eating the soup I ordered a draft rootbeer.  Completely excited about having a good, fresh rootbeer.  I was somewhat flustered to find that it was somewhat weak when I tasted it, though.  The flavor was there, but why was it so watered down?  My first time having Scotch eggs.  It is a hardboiled egg encased in ground sausage, fried, and then served with hot sauce.  The flavors were interesting, but it was difficult to get past the flavor of the exterior.  It tasted overcooked and bordered on burnt.  Is this normal?  As we finished this novel, new appetizer our entrees arrived.  Both entrees looked awesome.  Spectacular presentation for both entrees.  I went directly for the sausage and my palate left me perplexed.  The banger they use has a heavy-handed spice.  I tried the sausage with the half-mashed potatos and the gravy in differing quantities and couldn't get past the flavor endemic in the sausage.  I had to stop eating it.  I was able to split the open-faced roast beef with my friend.  The gravy was good.  The half-mashed potatos were good.  The roast beef was good.  WHY did the bangers have such a high dosage of this anathemic spice?    Ho Hum.  Will I return?  Yes, I will give Piper's another try; I will just make certain to steer clear of the bangers.",

It can be busy there, but you never have to wait too long for a table (we ask for a booth).  We always start with the curry and chips which are so delicious. This year I got the fish and (more) chips, and wow. I love fried fish, who doesn't, and this didn't disappoint at all. It could almost feed two, especially after an appetizer! I packed what I didn't finish to go and it's going to make a delicious lunch today. Fiance gets the Shepherd's pie yearly and it always looks amazing.   For drinks, I love that Piper's has Arsenal on tap! They also have a ton of beers that I'm pretty sure rotates regularly. The bartender is always awesome as well as our service in the dining area. I never have any complaints at Pipers!",

There are different headings for the cask ales, Pennsylvania beers, and the other available beers on tap which makes it easy to pick one out. Unfortunately, there isn't much more information about the beers on the menu than what I already mentioned.  I opted for a cask ale (specifically, the Flying Dog Doggie Style Pale Ale), and it was so fresh! Just delicious. I followed that up with a pint of Troeg's Nugget Nectar (one of my favorite beers which is available for a limited time during the year). Again it was so fresh! Their tap system also keeps the beer well chilled.  I'm so glad I gave Piper's another chance!",

Brunch is good.  I still feel like we have limited brunch options in Pgh, so this is a good go to. Whether you are getting a boxty or the traditional breakfast you should be satisfied.  Dinner--- I like the Shrimp and Chips, and most other items are good too. Beer selection is to die for... lots to choose from and they are constantly adding and changing things which keeps it interesting (while keeping the good old standby ones as well).    Service can be inconsistent, but you learn when not to sit in certain places.    Not a \"Bar\" bar... can be family friendly as well.  Never too rowdy unless it is soccer fans getting anxious watching their teams play.    A good spot worth checking out.",

When we asked for menu's, she gave us dirty, greasy menus straight out of the hands of people 2 tables down.  The blond girl with the leg tattoos was very pleasant and the cook who brought us our eggs was a nice, too. Nice looking place, pretty good atmosphere, the bar is beautiful and the tvs are great for games and such.   Will not return because Shelby left a bad taste in our mouth then copped an attitude because she's not very fast on her feet or grateful she has a job.",

There was a group of about eight people say directly behind us and we basically had to yell at each other just have a conversation.  For Friday night the place wasn't too busy but they had a good decent number of people there. I ordered some cabbage with mashed potatoes and my hubby ordered the tiki masala curry dish. I didn't like my cabbage although the mashed potatoes were pretty good, the cabbage was just way too hard I like mine to be a little bit softer like the kind you get at whole foods but this was still crunchy and had absolutely no flavor to it. The masala was just okay too it was very spicy to be just a mild and didn't have any seasoning in it so it kind of just tasted like you were eating hot peppers.  I had my family with me and they ordered fried zucchini for an appetizer. And my younger niece she ordered chicken fingers with fries. The chicken batter have absolutely no seasoning in it and it was like eating plain chicken.   I'm sorry to say that I probably won't be going back here. Most of the food was just to bland for my taste even the fried food didn't have that delicious buttery taste to it. Sorry but Pipers pub gets only two stars from me.",

    "text": "Piper's has been on my to-visit list forever, and I finally received the chance to check it out this past Sat. for dinner at 6:30pm.  I came for a double date with CM and some friends of mine who've been to Scotland, so I was very interested in their thoughts on the authenticity of the offerings.  Given the great things I'd heard about Piper's, it didn't disappoint--a good time was had by all, and all of us left well satiated!  For our appetizer, CM and I ordered the Ploughman's platter, which consisted of an apple-cherry chutney, two types of cheese, apple slices, gherkin pickles, and baguettes ($13).  This platter contained more than enough food for all four of us to share, and was a nice accompaniment to our entrees and drinks.  I say entrees because, due to an oversight on my part, we ordered the platter slightly after our entrees, so it came out at the same time as everything else, rather than beforehand.  I can't fault the waitstaff or kitchen for this, however, since the ordering error was mine!  Our friends ordered a whisky flight of the single malt basics ($12), which they enjoyed sampling, even if they didn't enjoy every whisky comprising it.  (One of them commented that the smokiest whisky, the Laphroaig, tasted like drinking a campfire!)  Interestingly, they mentioned that the lighter whiskys tasted different after having sampled the smokier ones, adding interest to the sampling.  For our entrees, we all ordered from the \"across the pond\" section of the menu.  Three of us ordered variations on the shepherd's pie (chicken shepherd's pie, $12; chicken mushroom cottage pie, $12; lamb and smoked chestnut, $12), and the other one ordered the bangers and mash ($12).  All of us enjoyed our entrees very much.  Because we didn't share entrees, I can only describe my own--the chicken shepherd's pie--firsthand.  Despite a somewhat visually unappealing presentation, the flavors were savory, comforting, and filling--exactly what I'd hoped for in a shepherd's pie.  According to our waitress, the filling of the cottage pie was exactly the same as mine; the only thing that differed was the topping (potatoes for the shepherd's pie vs. puff pastry for the cottage pie).  If I ordered this item again, I think I'd go with the puff pastry due to the greater visual appeal and added textural interest.  One minor criticism was that we felt that less meat than we expected was included.  As for CM, he enjoyed the bangers and mash, commenting that both the sausages and potatoes were delicious and filling--though I found the presentation of this dish a bit strange.  In line with my expectations, service from our waitress was responsive when needed, but unobtrusive when unnecessary.  The ambiance was appropriate for a UK pub, though I found the table configuration a bit awkward.  (We were seated at the high top closest to the host stand, which wouldn't have been my first choice, but it was busy, and that's what opened up when we came up on the list.)  Also, it was a bit on the loud side--though we didn't have any trouble hearing one another at the table.  The wait was about 20 min.--not too bad, considering we came during prime dinner hour on a Sat.  Then again, this is a pub, so I imagine it becomes increasingly crowded as the night wears on.  Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience at Pipers's Pub, and would definitely be willing to return in the future.  CM's and my total check came to $27 with a $10 City Dining card discount, and we felt the prices were fair for the quality and amount of food received.  If you need a break from the normal Carson St. bar scene and would like to experience a UK-style pub with quality eats, check Piper's out!",

Every time I have visited the bartender has been friendly and most importantly, knowledgeable about their food and the beer.    Their beer selection is amazing.  They emphasize quality over quantity and for me, they get it right.  I appreciate that they go out of their way to always feature about a dozen PA breweries.  I love that.  The food is so far beyond typical pub fare that that it's hard to compare to anyone else.  The quality is incredible.  The Scotch Eggs ($7.95) are a transcendental experience.  Of course it may be they last experience you ever have as you are whisked off to the ER to have a Roto-Rooter job on your arteries.  Try either the beef or chicken Shepherd's pie ($9.95) and be prepared to moan with delight.  As you can see from the prices there is no need to take out a second mortgage to visit here.  It's really quite reasonable.    The number choices available for food on Carson Street are phenomenal but much of it is average at best.  Visit Piper's and you'll enjoy some of the finest casual food on the South Side.",

While I didn't love my food, the server was a doll, the booths and overall environs comfy and warm, and the beer selection and pours predictably perfect.  I ordered a banger bap, bap being a kind of soft gooey airy roll upon which almost all their sandwiches are served. I got the cottage cheese (veritably yummy, I declare!) and the slaw (good!) but the banger patty was extra salty and tasted almost exactly like a Sausage McMuffin patty. As other reviewers have said, I'm not sure whiy this pub is such a standard. Everyone else loved their food, and I wish I had ordered something else. Because I'm rating this not on what it is reputed to be, but what I experienced - a solid four-star experience and a perfect place to get started on Carson Street.",

When we arrived we were greeted by the same fella who was dishing out samples at the Bash. We were seated at the back of the place so I was able to see the entire restaurant which was nice (I like to people watch). Our waiter showed up pretty quick and took our drink orders. As well the fella who seated us brought everyone out a glass of water. For the first round I had a mimosa which was perfect. Which means more champaign then orange juice. I knew going in that I would be ordering a Boxty. I went with a corned beef version. It was quite yummy. No complaints what so ever. My 2nd drink was my favorite. It was Apis Meaderys  raspberry blackberry mead. It was lightly flavored and not what I was expecting but in a good way. I could drink it all day. My only real complaint is how loud it was. It was hard to hear the person next to you. Also as a side note they have a kids menu and I liked their triangle crayons so I didn't have to go chasing rolling crayons. Well done Pipers.",

My friend and I arrived around 1pm & there was a 35 minute wait. The bar was packed so we put our name in and walked up the street to Mario's for a drink. When we got back to Piper's, we were sat immediately and quickly greeted by our waitress.  To start our brunch off right, I ordered a Bloody Mary and my friend ordered an Irish Coffee without the Jameson, just coffee and Bailey's. My Bloody Mary was refreshing but lacked pizazz. It wasn't spicy nor did it have any punch of pepper or any other type of seasoning. To my surprise, I found it to be weaker than the Bloody Mary I had at Mario's while we waited for our table. I've had great Bloody Mary's at Piper's so I chalked this up to be an off day at the bar. My friend had no complaints about the coffee. We opted for those as our liquid appetizers and ordered our entrees. I always go for one of three dishes- Vandaloo curry (hot), Roasted Vegetable Boxty or the Salmon Boxty. All of the Boxty dishes are available gluten free and that earns huge bonus points for Piper's! The Boxty dishes are a potato hash pancake with your choice of topping. During this visit, I opted for the Salmon Boxty. It comes with smoked salmon and sliced creamy dill cucumbers. I am not a fan of creamy food so I got the cucumbers on the side. Turns out, the cucumber sauce was light and not a heavy cream. The dill seasoning was not overpowering and complimented the dish very nicely! The portion was enough for two meals but coming off of an early morning race, I consumed the whole dish like a champion. I will order the Salmon Boxty again!   My friend ordered the vegan burger (brown rice & chickpeas) with provolone cheese, a side of BBQ sauce and fries. Sounds like a simple order, right? Well, when she got her dish, the burger had cucumber slaw and olive tapenade on it. Wayyyy off from her order! A food runner delivered the dishes to our table so when our waitress came by to check, she immediately recognized the kitchen error. She apologized and explained that she would reorder the dish and it would take a few minutes. A few minutes- no problem! Well, a few minutes turned into a 15 minute delay. For one burger! Our waitress offered a side salad or soup due to the delay and my friend opted for a side of fries. They brought those out with the correct burger but the wait was unacceptable. My friend still had an appetite for half of the burger and had no complaints about the taste. The vegan burger is not gluten free because it is rolled in bread crumbs so I was unable to try it. She got a to-go box for the rest and we got our checks. Despite throwing in an extra free side of fries, I thought Piper's would have discounted part of her meal due to the wait. Nope, full price. She was disappointed but opted not to say anything since we had already spent a lot of time there.   We both recognized that the kitchen mix up was not our waitress's fault. In fact, she was very apologetic and attentive the entire time but as a former waitress, I would have liked to see her communicate our wait time to a manager.   I am not ruling out Piper's for a future visit and I hope to see the bar and kitchen on their A game next time!",

    "text": "My friend wanted to try out this place, and after first scoping it out with yelp, I agreed to go too. We sat at the bar and started with some drinks--somewhat pricey drafts compared to all the other bar options on East Carson.   For food we ordered scotch eggs, and some burgers. The scotch eggs were interesting, since I've never had that before, and I just had to try it. I don't normally eat sausages, so I don't think I liked it as much as others.   For a burger, I ordered the vegetarian burger \"Grilled vegetable bap\" and cottage cheese. I LOVE FULL FAT cottage cheese. This made me happy. The portobello and goat cheese were a wonderful combination.   My friend's reuben was really good, which compared to my last reuben which was from Primanti's, there was no contest that this one was better.  I'd come back to try another burger.",

As bad as i wanted to order the American Breakfast, I thought  'When in Rome' and ordered the Irish breakfast. It comes with eggs cooked to your choice, 2 bangers (lol i think of Miley Cyrus when i see or hear bangers due to her album name-- judge me) , ham steak, mashed red potatoes and a roll.

There's often a wait for tables here, so plan to have a pint or so at the bar.  They have a good beer selection.

The bangers on the Irish breakfast were some of the best I've had. There was a flavor in them that I didn't quite recognize - cardamom? - but whatever it was, it worked beautifully. The potatoes were solid, but the scrambled eggs were a bit overdone... I'd recommend going with over easy/medium instead.  The bartender's top recommendation was the chicken & waffles, and they didn't disappoint... the sausage gravy over the chicken paired really nicely with the sweet waffle, and the chicken was cooked just right.",

    "text": "Piper's is really a one-of-a-kind pub in the heart of South Side. It's the only place that you'll find open at 7 AM on a Saturday for the earliest soccer games. It's the confluence of family-friendly atmosphere, young professional hangout, punk attitude, and rowdy soccer fandom.  Don't be fooled by the pub's unassuming looks. The food at Piper's is tops in the South Side...and I'm not just talking bar food. From Sunday brunches to Tuesday night vegan specials, Piper's takes all of it's food seriously, and you taste the quality.  For my money, this is where you'll find the best fish and chips in Pittsburgh. Some of my Irish friends would argue this with me, but I'm sticking to it. It's a great place for hearty meals like Guinness stew and Shepherd's Pie, but you'll also find filling and delicious items of slightly \"lighter\" fare. The hot pepper smoked turkey sandwich, housemade black bean burger, and the sweet potato po' boy are all some of my favorites, but nothing tops the brunch for me.  Stop in on Saturday or Sunday for an Irish boxty, and you'll be set for the day. If you haven't experienced a boxty, seriously give it a shot. Saturdays, they have special boxty and you'll often see Monday lunch specials using boxty, like a pulled pork boxty. Brilliant stuff. Sunday brunch also offers some excellent french toast.  From typical bar food, to sandwiches and burgers, to full-on entrees, Piper's does a solid job.  As for the beer, Piper's takes pride in picking out excellent choices of craft brews, supporting some of the more local breweries. Their selection of cask and draft beers are something worth paying attention to, as they don't last long. You also will be hard-pressed to find a better pint of Guinness in the area.  In the end, Piper's is a great, low-key place to catch your favorite soccer games (if you're a fan), get a great, reasonably-priced meal, and enjoy some quality beer. The scotch selection is serious, but as someone who's not into scotch, I'll leave that to the more knowledgeable. See you there!",

One of my favorite items to order is the Salmon BLT bap! Salmon is always cooked to order, medium is the best way to go! The Gaelic Onion soup is also a favorite. Great on a cold day. Great selection of beer on tap! Always rotating seasonal beers, local, PA, and great national and international brews! They also maintain clean lines, advertising when they clean the beer lines which I doubt a lot of south side establishments do.... Don't even get me started on the \"chips\" French fries for the Americans. So crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.....Sunday's the have Sunday dinner, roast beef is the main. Everything is fresh and prepared on site!!!! Always a place I take people visiting from out of town!!!",

I hadn't been to Pipers in a while so I felt like I needed another visit to properly review the place.  I got super excited about going there when I tried their Guinness Stew at an event last week so I was set on ordering that because it was so delicious, even in a buffet style!  But then at the last minute changed my mind, being tempted by the Lamb and Smoked Chestnut Shepherd's Pie.  It was so savory!  The Scottish Ale gravy was so thick and tasty and those crispy potatoes on top?  It was like icing on top of a delicious cake!  I am NOT one to forget about the sweet things in life, but this was such a hearty meal that there was no way I could have eaten dessert after such a hearty meal.    Now I can't wait to go back and sample some more delicious meals and have a nice English ale to boot!",

    "text": "Great spot, by far my favorite pub/bar/restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Have been here on different visits to the city over the years, latest being a week in March. No lie, I was in town 6 days and probably put in 5 trips to Pipers each time having different food and different beers.  The food is outstanding, from the fry ups (ie full English), to the boxtys, on to the salads , specials and the burgers. And we haven't hit the homemade desserts yet - awesome.  As a hop head, I fully appreciate a varied and quality beer list. The prices are low for a beer centric pub and selection was interesting. Extra kudos for keeping a couple of cask taps on rotation - a rarity in the US.  Final word of note is for the football. A friendly place to watch the game, morning noon or night. Just wish they could guarantee 3 points with your 3 pints :)  Other than PNC park, my favorite place to be in town.",

Once we sat down, the service was quick and our food came out fast.  I had the boxty with grilled veggies and roasted red pepper sauce - yum! Our server had recommended it over the salmon boxty and I'm glad she did. The veggies were grilled just perfectly - not overdone and slimy. The variety of veggies was nice too - zucchini, portabello mushrooms, and red peppers. The boxty was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. I ate the entire thing!   Mr. J was not so impressed - but I think the long wait and loud crowd did him in from the start. He wasn't in the mood for breakfast and settled on the Irish Boxty.",

Lastly, and of course they have killer food. Surprisingly, since they resemble and English pub, they also have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options! The vegan options are also not just a \"veggie burger\" or a salad. They have the real savory vegan dishes. I've had great vegan chili and I recommend the vegetable boxty, it was delicious. The only thing is if there is a game on it can get loud and crowded, it's not a huge place.",

    "text": "When I see any kind of \"Pub\", my antennae raise.  I've been to so many \"Authentic\" Irish/British Pubs that have disappointed. It ain't enough to serve Guinness and Corned Beef.  Then again, I've never been over to Blighty or the Emerald Isle, so I don't have a  reliable point of referance. But I DO have a pretty good bullshit detector, and I know a good place from a bad one.  Piper's is DEFINITELY a GOOD one. A little different, 'cos it's a SCOTTISH pub. I was comforted by seeing the extensive collection (one whole side of the long back-bar) of Scots Whisky. I was kinda pissed the nature of the luncheon precluded partaking in the smoky goodness of a wee nip-but as I am planning a return trip to Pitts, I will catch up. The Menu had all the stuff you'd expect to find, although no haggis.  I had their version of \"Toad In the Hole\" which was a dish of Bangers in Yorkshire Pudding.  This had \"Me\" all over it. I like Bangers and I like Yorkshire Pudding. It was advertised as coming with a Whisky-Onion Gravy, which I asked for on the side, as I also ordered a cup of the \"Hot Curry Sauce\" offered on other dishes. The plate was attractive-4 nice fat sausages in a remarkably light surrounding shell of Yorkshire Pudding. Both gravies/sauces were very very tasty. This shit didn't come frozen-SOMEONE who knew their way around a kitchen was doing their job, and doing it well. I was very very pleased. My companions had Fish and Chips, and a Steak Salad, both of which were substantial in size and appetizing in appearance. I would have been satsified with either one, but I'm glad I swung with the Bangers. I gave a momentary eye to the  Smoked Salmon Boxty, but sausages always win... Pub food isn't my usual choice, but I'd come back here in a heartbeat, and I intend to.",

    "text": "\"Girl brings 2 plates of full English over with plenty of scrambled eggs and plenty of fried tomato!\" - The Streets, \"Don't Mug Yourself\"  I've had a full English breakfast in London's East End. It was amazing. It fully lived up to its cultural references in songs (e.g. \"Don't Mug Yourself\"). But the \"full English breakfasts\" that I've experienced in America leave much to be desired.   Until now.   Piper's Pub's brunch is an extraordinarily British experience. First there's the pub itself: soccer on the widescreens, deep oak paneling, a bar stocked with so much Scotch it's mindblowing, and the coup-de-grace: a full English breakfast. A REAL full English breakfast.  So overwhelming were the choices that I opted for splitting the raspberry French toast with a buddy. (Do NOT, by the way, pour the inferior Mrs. Buttersworth on this bad boy - just let it soak in the raspberry sauce and slather the whipped cream over it). But I didn't stop there. With my innate portion-control issues, I ordered the full Irish breakfast. Eggs were perfect. Bangers were out-of-this-world. Mashed potatoes were appropriately potato-y - red skins intact! Ham steak was thick and well-seared. Tomatoes were ripe and flavorful. The roll with butter and jam was a delightfully sweet contrast. Good God, this meal was killer in every sense of the world. I probably killed my cholesterol level.  So how do I know the full English breakfast was 'real' if I only had the full Irish? I just know, friends. I. Just. Know.    For this brunch, I will willingly break my rigid no-bridge-crossing-for-brunch standard again and again.   Nuff said.",

    "text": "I practically live here, and with good reason.  The service is fast and friendly with servers and bartenders being very attentive.  I'm also seated quickly every time. I've sat at the bar, high tables in the front and booths in the back with all seating being equally comfortable and not a bad spot in the house!  Music is kept at a comfortable level and the tvs are always on [silently].    Now let me tell you, I am probably one of the pickiest eaters on the planet so I stick to three things here - chicken tenders, mashed potatoes, and their chimichurri flat iron steak.  Even when this place is packed, food always comes out quickly and is hot and fresh.  The chicken tenders are hand battered and come out golden with just the right amounts of pepper and crisp.  I choose the bbq sauce for dipping, but the honey mustard is also excellent.   The potatoes are a staple.  Half-mashed redskin potatoes piled high, always delicious and complement any dish on the menu.   The Chimichurri Flat Iron Steak is a new addition, replacing the previous steak.  I was pretty sad to see the original menu change, but boy do I LOOVE this new steak.   It was my first time trying chimichurri and I think it's quite amazing, which means a lot coming from such a picky eater.  Cooked to order and perfect every time [I get mine mid-rare].   Now let's talk drinks.  I'm not the kind of girl who wants all the chaos and drunken blabberings of most other people's Saturday nights, so when I want to go out but not deal with all of that jazz I'm at Piper's.  I'm not a personal fan of scotch but boy do they have a selection! And it's all very reasonably priced; many things are a fraction of the price of other places.  Plenty of beer on tap, too.  I usually stick to Arsenal or Strongbow cider while my buddy usually gets the Wells Banana Bread.   Bottom line: This is definitely a spot where you can feel right at home.",

I had vindaloo/chips- didn't even finish it, it was so bad . Not to mention when the server brought out our food it was literally two identical plates of brown mush, which was pretty unappetizing. I'm actually from/grew up in England and I was so looking forward to trying this place, as I get really homesick for the food. This is in no way possible British cuisine. Also the acoustics are really strange in there- it was about two thirds full but incredibly noisy, as in I could hear whole conversations from across the room. On the plus side, our server was very sweet and the beer list was decent. I know they're connected to the Fish and Chip place so in the future I'll stick with there/Fat Heads.

I went for Sunday brunch ~2pm, and the place wasn't at most half full.  They have a great beer selection with a rotating list of good micros, & a special Sunday menu.    We went for Scotch eggs & the Smoked Salmon Boxty.  The eggs took some time but my guess is that they were prepared fresh.  They were good...but I wasn't blown away.  Nothing against Pipers, I just don't think they're my style.  Interesting though.    The Salmon Boxty...it was amazing.  When I go back, I'll likely get the same thing...unlike me, but too delicious to pass up.  It's more than filling so don't order anything besides an appetizer, or you'll feel like a fat kid.  Think of it as a potato/egg omelette...or just look it up on wikipedia for better description.  Seriously though, get it.  Your life may be changed forever.

    "text": "If you're dining on the South Side, this is a totally solid choice; however, I probably wouldn't make a special trip just to eat here unless I was really craving some bangers and mash.  The atmosphere inside is pretty standard pub-type setting and decor; the restaurant does have a really nice tin ceiling.  This place does \"scottish pub\" pretty well, especially for the South Side, although it is still a bit more crowded and noisy than my favorite pubs.  (Side note:  The restrooms are right next to the kitchen door.  Apparently there is some sort of spatial issue involving cooks, waitstaff, and the swinging door.  If you are in the ladies' toilet, be prepared to hear regular LOUD cries of \"Coming In!\" followed by the sound of a slamming-open door.  Do not be alarmed.  Nobody is invading your temporary sanctum.)    There's a pretty good selection of beers, as well as a very nice whisky list (concentrating, of course, on Scotch and Irish whiskys, although I also spied a Japanese whisky and a smaller but well-chosen selection of bourbons.)  The cask beers, in particular, are nicely chosen and served well.  The menu features all the staple food items I remember from the precious year of childhood I spent in Scotland -- shepherd's pie (beef and lamb/chestnut, which seems like an interesting twist), fish and chips, bangers and mash, chicken pie, curry...  Sadly, a lot of the Scottish specialties were a little bit pricey for my budget -- I just can't feature paying $16 for bangers and mash, toad-in-the-hole, or shepherd's pie.  The lower-priced Scottish specialties seem reasonably authentic as well.  There is a ploughman's on the menu (looks tasty, but I did not get it, because it came with apple chutney instead of Branston Pickle).  The fish and chips is another less-pricey option, only the chips are not proper chips (they are medium-cut french fries, and very tasty ones at that, but not big fat chips), and there aren't any mushy peas on the side (at least not that the menu divulged).    I am kind of on a diet so I ended up getting a steak salad with Stilton cheese, and my husband got the Piper's Pub burger.  My salad rated a solid 3 stars; the greens were very nice, the steak was rare like I ordered, and the Stilton cheese was a good choice (I substituted it in for the ordinary provolone that comes with it).  The marinade for the steak had a nice flavor overall; unfortunately, the marinade also had a lot of salt.  At first it didn't really register, but by the end of the meal I felt like I was eating especially tender jerky that had been reconstituted in soy sauce and brine.  My husband's burger was another 3-star special -- the flavors were all really nice, but the burger was cooked more thoroughly than he had asked, so that the effect of the burger + cheese was a bit drier than he prefers.  Furthermore, the bun appeared to have been buttered but imperfectly toasted, so that crispy bits alternated with alarmingly buttery/soggy bits.  All in all, this is a reasonably authentic South Side simulacrum of a Scottish/British neighborhood pub.  I prefer Monterey Irish Pub -- although the food is less authentic in nature, it is generally cheaper and extremely tasty, the decor is nicer, and it is not quite as overwhelmingly crowded and noisy.",

    "text": "I have to agree with Aaron, and the more I go there the more I love the place. The atmosphere is what I imagine a British pub should be and the staff is excellent. We went for an after work happy hour and everyone loved it . The curry and chips are fantastic. So good that I took my sons back on Sunday for brunch. My wife and I tried the Gaelic Four Onion Soup and it was by far the best onion soup we have ever had. The Stilton cheese was the clincher. The portions are big and made with quality ingredients. The staff was very helpful also when my wife wondered what dressing  would be best on the Stilton and Rasher Salad. They have a incredible scotch selection. We have decided as a family that we would become regulars!",

A lot of choices on the menu and all looked tasty.  Great service. Over 20 beers to choose from and enjoyed the Strong Bow Cider and the East End Big Hop Harvest. Easy parking around the corner from the restaurant. A bit loud but not too bad.",

    "text": "This is an excellent pub that for some reason I never go to.  I was here on Saturday and was really happy with the people I met at the bar and the staff was outstanding.  The pub itself is quite nice.  It has tin ceilings, copper bar (I think), plenty of plasmas, booths in the back, and a few hi tops scattered about.  I was really impressed with the whiskey selection listing even a japanese option.  They also a premium bottled beer selection and plenty of draught options.  I started with guiness, but then was intrigued by the cask option because I rarely see cask conditioned ale's in this town except for church brew works.  The cask condition was some type of winter ale.  It was good if a little too sweet for me.  I wasn't that hungry, but we did order a couple appetizers.  I ordered the ploughmans platter (cheese platter) and ordered the artichoke and red pepper dip.  I wouldn't have chosen this dip, but she seemed to like it.  It was okay I guess.  The portion was huge the dip was warm and had a decent flavor, but it seemed a little too greasy for my liking.  It was served with bread that could have been warmed up a bit.  The cheese platter was pretty good.  It was served with a delicious apple chutney, fruit and a  few gherkins.  There were two cheeses.  I think they were both chedder. One was flavored with guinness and I'm not sure what the other one was, but it was green and I actually preferred the green cheese.  Overall this is a really good pub, with super friendly patrons, and a staff that's spot on.  I'll be back.",
