    "text": "I have to say that I am incredibly underwhelmed with this place. For a restaurant that prides itself in vegetarian cuisine, I would say that the food I've had there is significantly below par. I've been to the Double Wide a couple of times for drinks (even though I avoid the South Side like the plague), but I recently stopped in for food after work on a Groupon. I was by myself, so I had to get a bunch of food to cover the $20 I got on my Groupon :). I started with the seitan wings, which were not cooked well at all. The flavors was great (I think I got the BBQ flavor), but it left a lot to be desired. If you want killer seitan wings, go to Spak Brothers on Penn in Lawrenceville! After the wings, I got a tofu dish with rice. Again, while the flavors and spices were tasty, the tofu wasn't cooked well at all. I know it's difficult to cook tofu well, but come on guys, you advertise yourselves as a vegetarian/friendly restaurant! More so, all of the food was sooooooo overpriced! The seitan wings to start were $10 for 10 wings. Next, the tofu dish was around 12 bucks. I think they jacked up the prices because they know most people are going there with Groupons. For food this bland and untasty, the bang was definitely not worth the buck. I will definitely not go to Double Wide for food again, and I can't recommend this place to vegetarians.",

The renovated service station motif was executed brilliantly, with no detail spared. Drinks were awesome, and we were happy to have the opportunity to enjoy the sunshine a little as there were many other places within walking distance that weren't able to offer outdoor seating. We went up and down the cocktail menu and thoroughly enjoyed everything that we were fortunate enough to sample. Some of the signatures, such as the highly advertised frozen mojito, didn't pack too much of a punch, but whatever. The wait staff was very attentive and kind, and prices weren't out of control. Great spot at which to waste an afternoon.",

After 2 plates and about 10-12 ribs I was informed that the kitchen closed at 9:00 and even though we had ordered all you can eat the last order had to be in by 9:00.  I told the waitress to quickly bring me another plate of ribs and asked her to be back before 9:00 so I could order one last round. At 9:05 she returned to the table with three ribs and walked away. My personal opinion is my order wasn't taken until approximately 830 why was I not informed that the kitchen close at 9? The point that I set for 25 minutes before the waitress showed up  didn't help my cause at all. They were not busy so it's not like  anyone was in the weeds. I would have much rather ordered a full rack of ribs and been done with it. The whole \"all you can eat ribs\" night was supposed to be fun, as any gimmick should be.  Anyway I will not go back there and I will not recommend this restaurant to anyone. As far as the food is concerned it wasn't bad. I would say a little bit above average at best.",

The corner spot is perfect for the bikers who hang out there and the eclectic decor is cool.  I ordered a Hogaarden, which I get very excited to see on a menu and I got Tilapia tacos for dinner. Never had that kind of fish taco before, and living in San Diego has made me accustomed to getting breaded fish or Mahi Mahi grilled. I loved the Tilapia though! It came with a side of rice and black beans too.  The food was better than expected, based on just the overall feel of the place. They had a few veggie options like grilled tofu and a veggie burger. Good for families, large parties and just plain old fun!",

This should be a regular place for us, however, the service is terrible. The servers are not staffed properly. Our server last night, while very fiendly, was in waaaaay too many sections and had 4 parites of more than 6 people that we could see. Not one person at our table was offered a refill on their drinks. The people in my party eating the all you can eat ribs were only offered a second serving 30 minutes after they were done eating the first set. Their second set took an additonal 30 minutes to be delivered to the table.  At that point everyone was ready to go...but we couldn't leave because we were waiting for our checks.for what felt like an extra hour. I love a relaxing slow paced dinner, but 3 hours is waaaaaay toooo long. Both times I was there, I could not identify a manager on site. This place feels really unorganized.

Let me start by saying I only came here because the person I was with wanted to eat here for a couple months now. We approach the host stand only to see a miserable looking straight faced girl say \"there's a wait it will be 35 minutes\" ok no big deal we grabbed a seat. It's 5pm on a Sunday, Pens just won. Apparently this is what a \"35 minute wait\" looks like (see pics) Empty tables everywhere. Hostesses waiters and waitresses just standing around gossiping. That 35 minute wait quickly turned into a 45 minute wait. As we're waiting at a table we can hear people approach the host stand and the hostess girl is telling them there's a 45 minute wait, they can't sit and wait at a table but they can sit and wait at the bar. THE WHOLE PLACE IS EMPTY WHY CANT THEY SIT AT A TABLE???? Ok long story short by the time we're asked what we'd like to order 45 minutes have gone by, by the time we get our food we were sitting down long over 2 hours waiting. It took everything not to just get up and leave but the person I was with really wanted to try it out. He wasn't happy about the service whatsoever. Just not a good way to run a restaurant. Atrocious. Horribly run business and poorly managed, if there was a manager there tonight they should be reassessed.",

The sauce it was cooked in was very heavily salted...and the cucumber sauce it came with left a little to be desired. Overall, I would 100% come back for the seitan wings, the good atmosphere and the location.",

Make your own TV dinner is such a cute concept, but everything on the tray was awful. Frozen vegetables, colorless carrots, pulled pork that disintegrated when you touched it, and yellow crusty potatoes. We brought it to the attention of the very sweet waitress. She came back from the kitchen with a plate of fresh mashed potatoes, and new pulled pork (still not good). Why would the kitchen put out old food, if they have fresh??? More ridiculous (and partially our fault for not making a bigger deal) was that the virtually untouched food (including the new food) was not taken off the bill! We wasted $100, don't waste yours!!",

But the brunch we had at Double Wide Grill really bothered me throughout my day and I felt compelled to share my experience on Yelp.   My friends were in town from Chicago and we wanted to sit somewhere outside, so we tried Double Wide since they have a big patio. The patio was really the only good thing about the experience. Our server seemed clueless. She took our drink orders which included bloody marys, beers, and 3 waters. She came back a long time later empty handed and said \"they are still making the bloody marys\". Great, well bring the waters and beers then!!! It's hot as sh*t outside and how hard is it to bring water right away?  We ordered our meals, my friend got a veggie omelette. Instead, he was given a meat lovers omelette. My friend got the wrong side with his meal. The service overall was slow and lackadaisical.   As for the food, it was not memorable in any way. You could get this type of breakfast food at any diner or Denny's. Brunch is about unique creations and stuffing your face. The portions were not up to par either. This will not be a place I go back to for brunch.",

    "text": "It's very hard to get a drink at Double Wide's.  First you enter the restaurant and are made to wait at a hostess stand while the host or hostess ignores your party.  Then when you decide to go sit at the bar because you are tired of waiting around like a fucking asshole; you sit and sit and no amount of gesturing or gesticulation directed at the bartender yields your drink.  Meanwhile the bartender(s) are either updating their Twitter, \"I'm like, so @ work right now, LOL!!!\", chatting with their bff on Facers, or texting away like it's the first time they ever had a cell phone.  When you finally do get your drink, you better not drink it too quickly or by the time the bartender comes back around, your bleached bones will resemble a skeleton in the Sahara.    Went in for lunch during the work week one time; big mistake.  First the whole getting told to wait at the hostess stand, in an empty restaurant, while she disappears for an inordinate amount of time.  Then the whole \"we have no regard for the fact that you might have to get back to work, so we're to take an hour and a half to complete the process.\" Seriously Double Wides, you've never had lunch customers that have to get back to work?  Lunch is about getting in and getting out, not about dessert drinks and seconds on pecan pie.   Now, I'm not just being a gigantic malcontent for no reason.  I've been to Double Wides about 20 times and its always the same shite service.  Why do I keep subjecting myself to their lazy ways?  Well, the food is really good with a definite Southern flare.  Plus, if you can get a drink, they have an excellent beer selection and two awesome drink specials: $2.75 Jagers (anytime) and \"Breakfast\" one Tecate and one tequilla shot for $5.25.  SOLID.    So Double Wides, stop hiring these hipster jerks that won't take your customer's drink orders and streamline the seating process; it's annoying as hell to get ignored.  Oh, and one more thing.  Get your science right about fraqing.  Nothing is happening to the drinking water.  Fraqing happens at 7500', the water table is at less than 1000' nothing is matriculating up through a mile of rock.  Naturally occurring methane (coal) is to blame for whatever wad the felonious Gaslands documentary has gotten your panties into.  GO GAS!",

The aesthetic of this place is like a sports bar with decor such as beer bottles made into lamp covers and hubcaps all over the roof, but the vegetarian cuisine was as dead on as some run down hipster vegetarian joint. The seitan wings with parmesan garlic sauce were incredibly delicious. My girlfriend had this coconut fried tofu dish that had great potato sides that was pretty tasty as well. I personally had this dish called a potato taco. This was quite a unique and delicious dish.  All in all, the seitan wings were definitely the highlight and I would go back for that alone. The bar seems to have a good beer selection so this is probably a good place to take beer snob friends. Also looks like they have a good creative mixed drink selection that I would be interested in tapping into next time. I recommend.",

I've come here for dinner and drinks a couple times and it's been fairly decent both times. Their service and location are both unfortunate, seeing as the hostesses do a good job of ignoring guests and it's located smack-dab in the middle of the Southside (womp womppp). I will say, however, those veg chicken wings (make sure you get the garlic parmesan) are the BEST veg wings I've ever had! Spak Brothers is definitely a close second.  My main entree for both instances was pretty good, but not outstanding. I had a crispy tofu dish with lime and cilantro and rice. While it was yummy, it was one of those situations where it wasn't tasty enough for me to want to eat the leftovers for lunch the next day.  All in all, Double Wide has a wide variety of O.K. vegetarian options, though there isn't a whole lot that really stands out (aside from the seitan wings). Be wary of the service! They can tend to be a bit on the unfriendly side.",

It is highly advertised as \"dog friendly\" but in fact they completely isolate you and your party from the rest of the restaurant. In addition to that, it is beyond self service. We had to move our own table together, wipe and clean it ourselves and then you must walk up to a counter to order drinks and any food items. You must also pick up or drinks and food yourself at said counter. The worst part is in this area all silverware, cups and dinnerware is paper/plastic. The food took a terribly long time and food was not the best. There are open trash cans lining the area for you to then bus and dispose of your waste. Compared to every other establishment I've been to that is dog friendly that has outside seating or a patio where we have been treated as every other customer just with an animal companion, double wide grill was just not a pleasant experience.",

    "text": "That's it. Done.  I tried it as a meat eater over 7 years ago...FAIL - on all levels. And giving it another go on their vegan menu today. . .FAIL again. This is the type of restaurant that I am referencing when I say that the Top Owners aren't real chefs or foodie people. This is the type of restaurant where a group of savvy real estate people who bought property in busy and upcoming areas, and decorated the insides to pander to certain demographics.   That being said. The food was awful and they will never get my business again. I literally threw away $30 worth of food tonight. I thought wrong that in looking at their extensive vegan menu, that the kitchen knew what they were doing.  I ordered ToGo thru GrubHub around 3 hours before my estimated pick-up. Thought that makes it easy for everyone. . . It was inedible. We just couldn't eat it. First - everything was cold; but at the same time, there was burnt tofu. So we put the food in the oven to reheat it. That didn't help it at all. The flavors were super vinegary and over salty - I'm not even sure what was trying to be accomplished in either dish. And the vegan veggie of the day were gross packaged vegetables, sauteed in something super salty. My husband and I are both former line cooks for multiple restaurants, and even if we don't particularly like something, we almost NEVER complain, and will finish almost any dish. But we called and complained. It was too much food we were throwing away. :(  I'm mostly mad at myself for giving them another chance. In all of the times I had been there, it was a traditionally bad experience. But no - I had to believe the sheeple and believe that \"their menu really IS good now.\" No. It's not. And it never will be.   I will end with the ONE plus side - the manager on the phone handled the situation very well with my husband, and took flavor feedback for the kitchen. I don't know what will come of the flavor feedback, but neither will I be willing to find out.",

We won't be back -- Billie was far and away their best server, very warm and personable, always on top of our drink and food orders, and took the time to really get to know us. I genuinely can't imagine what justification they would have to terminate Billie, as she was truly fantastic, and we were just two of many regulars who came there just to see her.   The food at the Double Wide is just OK. It isn't particularly flavorful or anything that you would make a special trip to eat. Its main claims to fame are (1) having vegetarian and vegan options, (2) having a patio, and (3) having a spot for dogs outside. NOT the food (I don't know anyone who goes there for the food...). My son would get the pizza, and the pepperoni was almost always burnt (how do you screw up a presumably frozen pizza?!?), while my meals usually were under seasoned and dry. For example, the refried beans in the vegetarian tacos seemed like they had been sitting in a pan for hours before being slapped into a taco. Again, we went there because Billie was so friendly and warm, and made the place seem like home. Now we'll find a new spot for our Monday night dinners.",

More to my enjoyment was that they served vegan food. I decided to have the Seitan Barbeque wings and my entree was the TV Dinner (Barbeque sandwich, mixed veggies, French fries, veggie kabobs, and cole slaw). Yes, this was all vegan and I was drooling thinking about it. But as I've experience in the past looks and thoughts of a delicious meal can be deceiving--this meal was not the case. Everything was delicious and was the best TV dinner I've ever had, even when I was a bachelor and this was my nightly meal.   Outside of the meal, the ambiance and service was great. We sat outside on the patio and experienced an amazing night of beautiful weather.  Would I go back? Heck to the veggie yes, and encourage any vegan, or vegetarian, to support this trendy establishment.",

I responded to an ad for a $20 groupon and wound up buying a $40 Groupon accidentally. I didn't even realize it was an option until it was too late. Well, a $40 groupon will work when I take my family but tonight it'll just be us two so I went ahead and also bought the $20.  Turns out, three of us went so I expected to use the $40 Groupon after all. When I went to redeem it, the waitress said oh the fine print says for four people and you only have three.  Nevermind that we had over $50 in food between the three of us (and adding alcohol we were just shy of $80.) I didn't want the $40 Groupon to begin with and felt tricked into purchasing it, and now the waitress is telling me I am violating the small print, but I could use a $20 groupon. (Now, why would she think I might have both?). And she kept going on and on about it and finally I told her to stop! Just stop talking. I was angry now, the night was ruined at this point feeling that I had been swindled and I simply wanted to leave.  By this time they had both of my groupon numbers and I clicked redeem on the $20 one. Apparently she let the manager know I was not happy and he said they can use the $40 groupon after all.  But now both groupons show redeemed so to make up for it they gave me a $20 gift card. (And I tipped based on the $80 sale even though the waitress could have prevented the whole episode.)  So ok, yeah, I am not out anything moneywise.  But the experience was infuriating and not one I want to repeat.  I won't remember my meal in a couple months but I will always remember this terrible Groupon experience at Double Wide.   Groupon just isn't worth it.",

For a cocktail that costs almost $8 I would like it to taste better. I had the seitan pulled pork sandwich, the bread it was on was a terrible choice. It was a multigrain bread that was super thin and it was hard to eat, and it was messy in a not delicious way.  My boyfriend had the pulled pork platter, and it was delicious. It had a syrupy, tangy sauce and came on the perfect bread. He left fat and happy. The creamy cherry coleslaw was bland, I was waiting for something special but it never came.  But overall, it was a nice experience. The decor is cool, the service is quick and courteous. I could see this place being fun in the summertime.",

Besides the outdoor seating which is awesome, DWG doesn't have much going for it.  I've tried so many things on the menu and nothing sticks out as being \"good\".

They were slightly too tall and a shorter person may not have been able to have their feet touch the floor. I am not short, and my feet firmly touched the floor, but I worry for my short friends and family who may have their legs dangling while they eat. This could be quite a displeasure. What I do like about the chairs is that you can use the posts for a temporary cup holster in an emergency situation. Very handy! The padding on the chairs are mediocre at best and left my buttocks slightly asleep during and shortly after my meal. Along with these minor grievances the chairs are too heavy for the average human, which leads me to believe these chairs quite possibly weren't made for human beings. Just a thought. All in all, good food. Horrible chairs. Great atmosphere.  (P.S. The booths looks more comfortable)",

    "text": "I came here with my family, as it was one of the few places we could find that catered to both carnivores and vegans.  Our server - let's call him Alex - was a little odd.  First he introduced himself and took our drink orders.  He came back with our drinks a few minutes later and asked us if we were ready to order.  We were ready to order, but before waiting for our answer he turned to my father and started talking to him about the baseball game playing on the television.  My parents don't speak very good English and it was obvious that my father wasn't able to follow what Alex was saying.  Alex seemed to suddenly realize this, and then inexplicably walked away without saying anything.  We were confused, to say the least.    He came back ten minutes later and introduced himself...again.  He took our orders.  I ordered the full order of seitan wings with vegan barbecue sauce with some vegan shoestring fries.  My brother ordered a sandwich.  My parents ordered something or other - I can't remember.  A while later, he appeared with our food.  He put down a small plate of cubed seitan in front of me.  He then asked, \"You ordered the half order right?\"  I said no, I ordered the full order.  He said, \"Crap, I'll be right back with your full order.\"    He came back shortly with a second plate.  I noticed that everyone but me had a little plastic cup filled with sauce.  There was a pitiful amount of drizzled hot sauce on my seitan blocks.  I reminded Alex that I had ordered barbecue sauce and asked him to bring me a cup of it.  He said, \"No, you ordered hot sauce.  I KNOW you ordered hot sauce.  I would have remembered if you ordered barbecue sauce.  Do you want to add barbecue sauce as well?\"  I insisted that no, I'd ordered barbecue sauce and he insisted that no, I hadn't, I'd ordered hot sauce.  I didn't want to ruin what was supposed to be a pleasant evening out with my family so I let it go.  I was extremely annoyed.  Borderline furious.  He came back later on to check on us and asked us where we were from.  We could see that he had no idea that it existed, nor that he cared.  He said, \"Oh, I was wondering why you didn't understand the baseball thing,\" and then immediately left again at a half-trot.  Soooooo weird.  My brother noticed that his \"sandwich\" lacked a piece of bread.  Last I heard, two slices of bread are the required criteria for a sandwich.  My family members' meals were so-so.  My vegan seitan wings were actually really good and tasted exactly how I remembered chicken wings to taste like.  However, the hot sauce which I hadn't ordered or wanted gave me an upset stomach.  I was definitely peeved.  The atmosphere was great.  You can eat outside or inside.  It was too humid to eat outside so we chose inside.  It's set up like an old mechanic's shop, which I'm assuming it used to be.  Real cool set up.  There's only one huge TV instead of a thousand small ones, and normally with a more professional/attentive server and food served the way I'd ordered it, I'm sure I would have had a great time.  I wouldn't really recommend this place if you have other options available.  We all left dissatisfied with the food and service.",

It was a rainy Saturday and our group was glad to sit outside under their porch for a very lovely brunch.  I was somewhat skeptical as their food for dinner is just mediocre bbq.  I was pleasantly surprised they had a huge brunch menu with lots of options I wanted to try from omelets to French toast and pancakes.  I went with an omelet that was served with brie, apple slices, and walnuts.  It was delicious and these toppings were actually put on top of scrambled eggs but nevertheless a great combo.  The dish also came with potatoes and a slice of fruit.  I would love to go back and try the pancakes which others in our group ordered including chocolate chip and blueberry which looked fantastic!

    "text": "Double Wide Grill is a surprising place to find vegan options, but I was more than happy with my findings. I went in and tried the lentil burger and fries as well as an order of seitan buffalo wings. My two friends ordered what I believe were vegetarian dishes - a portobello burger and some type of hearty chili.   For a place that sells bar-like junk food, my lentil burger was certainly healthy. It tasted healthy. I wouldn't order it again because it was too healthy for a restaurant meal, and when I eat out, I like to indulge a little. Either way, I recognize its value as a good menu option and it is definitely a great choice for someone who wants to eat healthier when they eat out.   The seitan wings were interesting. The restaurant obviously doesn't specialize in vegan food, but they had a unique texture and flavor I have never experienced with seitan before. That's a GOOD thing.   The chili my friend had was also amazing. It was filling, nutritious and flavorful.   Prices are great for the portion sizes, and our server was incredible. She was very helpful in helping us choose items, and she brought refills promptly.   I look forward to returning to Double Wide Grill and trying some of the other vegan items on the menu. It's a fun atmosphere even though we went while it was quiet. I would love to go here again during the night and have drinks.",

They actually have a special outdoor place for the pooches to hang with their owners, but (and I'm sure this is for sanitary reasons) the servers can't actually enter that area so it makes the service a little disjointed.  That, and it was blazing hot, made it a little awkward.  But then the food, oooooh, the food!  They have an impressive vegan offering, and so many fun combinations....I ended up with a yummy chicken sandwich and the cheesy rice balls, and sweet potato fries.  It was one of those times I ate so much it was uncomfortable....but oh so worth it!  Plus, for the gluten free they do take care of you, too, so definitely stop by.",

There is also a huge outdoor patio, with a sectioned-off space for those who want to dine with their dogs.   I highly recommend the brunch. The lunch/dinner menu can be hit or miss. For vegetarians, I recommend the coconut curry tofu, the potato tacos, and the veggie chilli cheese fries, the salads, and everything veggie on the brunch menu.

They have two versions to choose from, and let me tell you my friend, go with the Double Wide Benedict!  Fried eggs, bacon,  spinach, and CORN BREAD!!   WINNING!  And what makes a brunch even better....a boozy one!  The peach Bellini hit the spot!  What's also great is they have a ton of events like trivia and karaoke nights.  Surprisingly, there are few places in the burgh to get your roake on, so this is a welcome addition!  I'll be back to eat and spy on people this summer!!",

I 'm from Texas where beer and BBQ go hand and hand not meatless wings. I was thrilled to be able to sit at the bar have a beer and enjoy a vegan meal!  The staff was helpful and friendly . This was my first time to Pittsburgh and Double Wide definitely left a lasting impression.  Great Food and great service. looking forward to my next visit to Pittsburgh!",

I ordered the veggyro with red pepper rice and my sister ordered the pulled seitan sandwich with a fruit cup. It's a great place to watch the game or have a big group. When our food came they got my sisters order wrong and didn't put tomatoes or lettuce in her sandwich. They also gave her coleslaw instead of her fruit cup. I thought the seitan in the veggyro had way too much sauce spilling out of it too. At least the food was good and the service was friendly and fast.",

The seitan wings were also very tasty and the service was great, however, the last two times that I have visited it was very disappointing in terms of service.  The service was very slow in seating us (said it would be 20 min for 2 people and it was 45), taking our order, and bringing out our food.  I'm not sure why there would be such a huge difference in service between my experiences, but I can only guess that it was because the second and third times were during the winter when they didn't have additional seating outside? I will probably give it another chance in the summer to redeem itself!",

    "text": "I've been to the Double Wide several times - it definitely has it's pluses, but also has minuses (hence, the middle of the road rating).  Pluses:  The cornbread:  It's good. It has a sugary crust on it that is a delightful surprise. I love corn bread and the Double Wide has gooood cornbread!  The drinks: Fantastic, in general. The beer selection is great and they will bring you a sample of anything they have on tap to make sure you like it before you order a full draft.  The mixed drinks are generally pretty good too. They have a great mixed drink/cocktail menu that has a lot of fun stuff on it. That said, I've been there for brunch and what they serve as their bellini is NOT a bellini, which is really disappointing.  The seating: It's big. You likely won't have to wait for a table. The outdoor seating is awesome when the weather is nice. It's a good place to watch sports (hockey!) because they have two huge TVs in the dining room and several other smaller ones.  Minuses:  The service: I've never had great service there. It's always slow and spotty. So frustrating.    The food: It's hit or miss, really. It's a shame because the menu is super varied and has a ton of options for everyone - carnivores, vegetarians, vegans, gluten-free, etc. It's just NOT consistent. I've had really good food there, but I've also had really bad food there. I've had great pulled pork and horrible ribs. Great fries one time, crappy, cold fries the next. But the cornbread! The cornbread is always good!  Sooo. Bottom line: I never go out of my way to go to the Double Wide, but it's a good place to go to if I want to watch a hockey game w/ a group of people or every place else is packed.",

Came with a side of dipping cheese which was a pleasant surprise.   I was leaning towards either the ribs or a burger but the waiter recommended the brisket so my wife and I both went with the brisket sandwich.  I was expecting a heaping mound of brisket on a bun but the sandwich was so small that I literally finished it in three bites.  Without the fat it would have been two bites. My daughter had the chili fries and the were also disappointing.  The fries were mixed with what appeared to be chili made with brisket but the dish looked more like soup than chili.  It was so soggy that the she didn't really eat it.  She also complained that it had no flavor, probably because all the liquid drowned out whatever flavor there was. My son had the boneless wings.  He didn't eat them as he was in a bad mood so my wife and I cleaned them up.  They were the best part of the meal with the buffalo sauce being a very good flavor. Overall, vey disappointed but the waiter was so nice we didn't feel like complaining.  Anyway, won't be back.  Too bad as its a nice place with lots of outdoor seating.",

Normally that would be more than enough time. We didn't get our first plate until 7:45. We sat for another 30 minutes with empty plates and glasses. Iced tea was warm with a couple of ice cubes. Had to ask for more ice. Second plate shows up, that was fine. Third plate showed up ice cold, we got our check and left. Not going back.   Update... went back last week for the ribs again. They were worse this time. Our server didn't know the menu, so we ended up ordering the wrong sauce on our ribs. Also, the ribs were tough and dry. You guys need to fire your chef, kitchen manager, whoever is in charge of the food. If you're going to you do BBQ, you need to know how to properly make ribs. It's clear that you do not.",

My favorite thing to get here is the TV dinner.  I love sampling all the different items.  From ordering this I discovered how much I like their Coconut Mango Tofu!    My partner loves their housemade lentil burger.  Other sandwiches we've gotten here have just been 'okay'.    Vegans go nuts for this place, and they should.

This is probably one of the best places for vegetarians because almost every option they have can be turned vegetarian or vegan. I struggle a lot with finding restaurants where I can enjoy a good meal while satisfying my omnivore counterparts, but this place has it all.   I've been to DWG several times and their seitan dishes never fail. Everything from the pulled seitan sandwich to the wings are amazing! During my last visit, I had BBQ seitan as a protein add-on for my grilled vegetable & brie salad and it was phenomenal. The portions are always generous so you never leave hungry.   I highly recommend DWG if you're looking for a casual brunch, lunch or dinner in South Side. Service is always fast and friendly while the food is always delicious and filling.",

(I have never had anywhere tell me that before and I have used many, many groupons). I had printed it out since Groupon states you may print the Groupon and use it and I was out of data. Well, apparently that rule does not apply here. On top of that, the Seitan was not good... at all. My burger was also terrible. The nachos were the only thing I would order again.

Same as their dinner.  I went with stuffed French toast (stuffed w. cream cheese) which came with a side of potatoes. My bf ordered the double wide Benedict. My French toast was ok, but idk it sounded better in the menu. The cream cheese was off. Idk if it was fat free or vegan or whatever. The French toast itself was great. The side of potatoes were lacking in quantity, but still were good. My bfs Benedict was (to his surprise, lol) served on cornbread. He substituted cheesy grits for his potatoes. He enjoyed it but said the eggs were cold. He's extremely picky on grits and didn't like it either (i tried it as well. Again, the taste was off) he said the meal would've been better if the eggs and corn bread were hot.  Service was good. Our server was new but still did a great job.  I've experienced double wides ribs and other comfort food dishes. The menu and food are good, as well as the service. We live nearby and come by seldom, but we still do visit. I just personally feel that its a little overrated and sometimes the food isn't as great as expected. today's meal proved the same. It is a cool spot though in the summer with the patio and dog patio. The food and drink menu are great.",

    "text": "This review is on the service (or lack there of) received Saturday. Double (why)ide on Earth would i ever come back? My boyfriend and I drove to the Southside after a long day of hiking, specifically for this establishment; we heard the food was good, though we've never been. We show up at 3:40 PM, in between lunch and dinner hours, not busy, no reason for the service we were dealt. We walk up to the host stand, wait around for a few minutes as 2 employees walk past- not a single word, nor smile, no \"someone will be right with you\". Someone finally comes along to seat us. Menus were filthy, seat had left over food on it, but it was okay we we're starving and excited anyways.   After looking over the menu, and seeing about 3 servers walk past, amongst other employees fiddling their thumbs, we looked at the clock and realized it was 4 pm. That it's been 20 minutes of absolutely NO service. No greeting, no drinks, not even water...0 acknowledgement whatsoever. We said what the heck? We decided to wait 5 more minutes, because we've both worked in the restaurant business before, we understand stuff happens. So 5 more minutes...Nothing. I saw another table seated near us get up and ask for the check because they never even got their drinks.. they were already sitting when we arrived 25 minutes ago. I really hate to give negative reviews but this was the poorest excuse of restaurant service I've ever experienced.   We went to Fat Heads instead, got seated right away and greeted/fed right away. Who knows how long we would have been sitting before even being greeted? Sad I didn't get to try your turkey burger, probably won't be back.",

    "text": "I've been going to Double Wide for the past 6 years or so. It's always been a place that's offered solid bar food, interesting atmosphere, and vegan options where I wouldn't have expected them. That said, I think I'm going to stop going there for a while.   My girlfriend and I stopped in today after she had noted the drop in quality over our past few visits. I hadn't noticed, so I wanted to test it out. She ordered the California Salad and I got the Breakfast Burger.   I ordered my burger cooked medium. When it came out, there wasn't a trace of pink inside the burger--completely well done. Although I hadn't noticed many significant flaws about the restaurant in the past, I've definitely been served up some overcooked burgers during the 6 years I've gone to Double Wide. I don't say this to nitpick my meal to death, but to make a larger point about Double Wide: for a place that advertises their grill so much they seem to have very little awareness of how to effectively use one.  My point here is simple: if your restaurant has the word \"grill\" in the title, you should know how to cook a burger.   My girlfriend's California Salad was fine, but uninspiring as a vegan option, and definitely overpriced. We paid almost $13 for it, but could have gotten the same ingredients at Hello Bistro for $3 cheaper. Double Wide used to be a great option for us because of the fact that it had vegan items on their menu. But as vegan diets have become more popular, and more options have emerged around the city, Double Wide's vegan selection just seems stale at this point. Their seitan is historically pretty good, but the rest of their assortments of salads and vegetable entrees are just sort of a snooze to pick from.  Then there's the little things. Double Wide is more-or-less a sports bar. When we went in, not a single TV was on. I ordered blue cheese with our seitan wings. We didn't receive it, but were still charged for it. I had to ask for lettuce, onion, and tomato where in the past, they've been offered to me.   Double Wide is a fine restaurant, but it's just growing stale. Over the past 6 years that I've been going there, I haven't seen any significant changes to their menu. And on top of that, leaving with 45+ fewer dollars in my pocket isn't very appealing when I can receive a meal that delivers more care and innovation at a multitude of other places around this ever-changing city.",

If you're not rolling with cash and don't mind paying a lot for pancakes, by all means get it because it is tasty.",

What I also didn't like is that they seemed to be doing a FULL MAKEOVER of the building, so it was pretty hard to remember where was where. Still, the food tasted like food.

I'm always weary about ordering anything with Portobello mushrooms because a lot of times they marinate them too long or something & they end up tasting like straight vinegar. It's just really nice to go to a homestyle restaurant & not have to get a simple salad or side dishes.",

We asked if the appetisers could please come before dinner. They came at the same time, after a long wait. I have to have gluten free and the one gluten free appetiser was stuffed mushroom. The cheese wasn't melted entirely and it was cold in the center.  Wings weren't anything special.  We had to wait a long time to get our check which was pretty pricey.  To be honest the staff are very low energy and don't seem to care about their work. Whomever is doing the hiring may wan to consider work ethic and intelligence rather than cup size.

The veggie chilli was the highlight of the whole meal. Also, someone got their cherry coleslaw and really liked that. Other than that nothing impressive.  Also a previous reviewer had mentioned the scantily clad servers but I figured it couldn't be too bad since I hadn't seen it in other reviews, but I gotta say I wouldn't consider this a family restaurant. All the women were wearing low cut tanks with their bra straps and the bras themselves on some girls showing. Some were wearing shorts others tight jeans.

She jokingly harassed the two of us for being camels and drinking all their water, but quickly wised up and gave us a pitcher of water.

The restaurant is in a converted auto service station. They have a decent size dining room and offer a lot of outdoor seating when it is warm out. It is primarily a Barbecue joint that also has a large selection of sandwiches, burgers and vegan meals. The Barbecue is good. Probably a little too heavy on the pepper. I usually get ribs or brisket there. Both are good, but a little on the drier side than I would prefer. Mixed with sauce, the dryness isn't as noticeable. Their burgers aren't too bad. They also serve brunch on weekends. The brunch is good, but doesn't blow me away. Double Wide probably has the best barbecue in South Side, but certainly not the best in Pittsburgh. Double Wide also has a large selection of regular domestic beers and microbrews on tap. Their prices are reasonable considering you get a full plate of food.  My issues with Double Wide have primarily been with service and misleading advertising. There have been multiple times I have eaten at Double Wide when our server has only taken one person's drink order and leaves or just disappeared for long periods of time and didn't check on our table or offer us the check when the table was cleared. We used to leave long comments on receipts complaining about the servers, but stopped after we noticed they never would fire the ones which everyone had issues. My recent experience, and why I decided to write the review, was after trying to use a Groupon. Every year or so Double Wide Grill offers a Groupon to attract more business. The Groupon lists no exclusions other than not valid on alcohol and the other regular Groupon terms. I was very disappointed when they told me in the restaurant their daily specials such as all you can eat ribs and wing night are excluded from Groupon use. This is not listed on the Groupon anywhere. Double Wide insisted these daily specials count as 'other offers' part of the Groupon. They even told me multiple people had tried that night to use the Groupon on the daily specials. It is disappointing they use the Groupon to bring you in, knowing most people will try to use it on the days with a special, only to have to order something else.  I can't say I won't ever be back since I know friends will want to go there, and I know I am a sucker for all you can eat anything. However, I can say it will be a little while before this experience wears off and I return.",

    "text": "I work on the South Side and I've been really curious about this place.  And I've had a BBQ craving lately.  So, despite the poor reviews about the service and food that my coworkers had given me, I decided to try it out.  I ordered a BBQ combo of brisket and ribs.  It was awful.  The brisket was chopped instead of sliced and it was lying in a pile under a quarter rack of ribs.  The brisket was dry as a desert with no sauce served at all, not even on the side.  And this dried up meat desperately needed sauce.  It had no flavor and no spice.  Icky!  The ribs looks good, but they were served as a quarter rack and the knife I had was just a dinner knife and would not cut through the ribs so I could separate them.  They had a little more flavor with some kind of slightly sweet sauce brushed on the outside.  But the best I could do was scrape a little meat off the bone. I took the ribs back to work and gave them to the office food scavenger.  If figured if he could find a way to cut them apart, more power to him.    The service was actually pretty good.  But that's not enough to get me back into this place.  I'm sure there's better BBQ somewhere in Pittsburgh.",

I would say the dog patio is great if your dog isn't a total little jerk..we have a couple dogs that did ok but it IS a bit stressful. You also have to kind of serve yourself but it's worth it to keep the fur babies along. Everyone on the patio was super friendly too.   Great happy staff etc...  We went back to try out another meal inside at night but unfortunately it was a little sloppy/bleh. I think there are just too many items on the menu to keep them perfected.   It is a huge option for vegans though so we will not write it off, just hope that the quality improves because I could see us being regulars if it did.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I wanted to go out for dinner on Memorial Day and decided to take a drive to Southside to see what was open. After driving past tons of closed bars, we saw that Double Wide was open and decided to check it out. We weren't super impressed last time we visited, but figured we would give them another chance.  There was one hostess working and we were told it would be 10 minutes. I was super hungry and therefore didn't stray too far away from the hostess stand, in order to be able to best hear our name, as soon as our table was ready. Their system did not make sense to me at all. There were a decent amount of empty tables, but it appeared they didn't have enough bussers to clean them quick enough. Waiting 10 minutes is not a big deal at all- it is just frustrating, when there are open tables the entire time and no one there to clean them.   We were sat on the patio, which I was happy about (their patio is pretty awesome). Our server was friendly and attentive to our table the entire time. I decided on the California salad- which was described as a bed of romaine/iceberg mix with half an avocado, grilled portabellas, grapes, sunflower seeds, sprouts and grape tomatoes. The menu suggested their cilantro lime vinaigrette, so that is what I chose. It also came with one single piece of cornbread. My boyfriend ordered their Hawaiian burger- which appeared to be packed with flavor, according to the menu and photo. My salad ended up being made of entirely iceberg lettuce, which was really disappointing. The grilled portabellas were odd and were marinated in some type of balsamic, which really didn't compliment the cilantro lime vinaigrette. The best part of the salad was the grapes and the cornbread.. which isn't saying much. My boyfriend was disappointed in his burger as well. Although it was rather large, it was tasteless.   Although their location and patio is ideal for Southside, the food is tasteless and just overall disappointing.",

The atmosphere is fantastic, with great memorabilia on the walls, and even garage doors that open into the outdoor seating area when it's nice out!  The food was fantastic and the portions were great, in my opinion. Lots of food for a reasonable price, but not so much that I felt too full afterwards. I got the pulled pork (on one of their \"trays\" I believe) and it tasted great. Definitely a great place to come with family and friends. I really want to eat outside sometime when the weather is warmer.",

It seems that they have expanded the menu over the past few years and one good thing is that they have a TON of vegetarian/vegan options.   The atmosphere is nice. There is ample opportunity for good people watching and the outside area is shaded and breezy for when you want to sit outside on a hot day. They also have a separated dog patio which is a nice accommodation for those with dogs and for those who would rather not sit next to a dog while eating.   Our waitress was attentive but not overly personable -- which is totally fine by me. I had the hawaiian burger with fries. The food was fine but not memorable. The sandwiches and burgers seemed fairly priced but the entrees looked over priced to me.   I'd come back if someone invited me but probably wouldn't go out of my way.",

Double Wide is much more than just a compromise, they were both well satisfied.  The outdoor seating and atmosphere is great, especially if you get such beautiful weather as we did...  once you get used to the (sometimes ludicrous) rumble of Harleys as they leave on east carson.  I had a Border Patrol burger (avocado, peppers and cilantro) which was well grilled... nothing to go too crazy over but well done.  My significant other had a lentil burger version of the same and left very happy.  That said, who else in Pittsburgh serves SEITAN and TOFU and attracts bikers on harleys in the masses?  Granted, it was hard to tell if these were the authentic biker types or the Sewickley harley types but they weren't wearing helmets so I doubt they were from that uppity of a suburb.  I had my mind on a tasty burger but I can't wait to go back and try some of the vegan and vegetarian options (Seitan wings, seitan ribs, seitan pulled pork sandwich and salad and probably 3-4 other tofu/veggie options).  Oh, and prices were extremely reasonable.  Sandwiches and burgers were $5-8 with only things like steaks and ribs venturing into the teens.",

We went at about 9 pm on a Friday, and sat outside, which was great fun, and the BBQ was in full effect, the charcoal smelling awesome.  One thing that was a bummer was that we were excited to try the sweet-potato-and-carmelized-onion croquette appetizer on the menu, only to be told when ordering that they were out of sweet potatoes.  Bummer!  We settled for the onion rings, and they were great, a huge portion with some amazing sauce.  I got a burger with the fresh fries, a mountain of them, which were delicious.  I also tried a frozen mojito, which was something I had never tried, but was also tasty.  I like the atmosphere here and I will most definitely be back!",

The seitan isn't that rubbery stuff you are in danger of getting anytime you order seitan at a new restaurant. In fact, to my delight it is almost a seitan-tempeh hybrid with just a hint more texture that really serves its special purpose of being turned into wings. With three choices for sauce (BBQ, spicy, or honey garlic), you can bet I've been back for seconds, and I don't even live in Pennsylvania.   And how can you have wings without beer? They have a pretty respectable list and a patient staff who helped my wife and I get exactly what we were looking for on more than one visit. We even ventured into the food menu once and enjoyed almost everything we tried. If you're like me, the heavy-handed theme of the restaurant may be a bit of a turn off, but give it a chance. As it turns out, it is not one of those chains your parents dragged you to as a kid.",

The decor is a kind of cheesy but retro in the same respect. I liked that they didn't clutter their wall too much like some restaurants. Our waitress came over to us and was sooo friendly but not in the annoying fake way. She was vegetarian and gave us the low down on what she really liked.  I ended up getting a Lentil Southwest burger with a side of mashed sweet potatoes and my girl got the BBQ tofu skewers with regular mashed potatoes. Everything was delicious and really hit the spot, especially after wondering around the city all day.  The waitress checked on us often and gave us some other restaurant suggestions while we were in town. I'm from Pgh but a lot has changed in the past four years.

You could tell it was made with actual corn and not just from a box.  My meal was just ok. I ordered the bbq brisket.  I wasn't feeling the bbq sauce (too sweet) and my meat was a little dry. All was forgiven though since they did provide me with those delicious onion rings.  I could sit here and drink beer after beer from their fairly extensive beer menu and just eat onion rings and corn bread. In fact if I'm ever back here, I might have to do just that.",

    "text": "I can honestly sum up my experience at the Double Wide Grill as \"not impressed\".  I visited the place for a group get together.  Unfortunately, the \"party room\" they have is so small that the 20-30 of us were unable to really mingle much.  The company at my table was great, but other then that, there is nothing about the menu that makes me want to rush back to the Double Wide.  Now the rest of the restaurant with its inside and outside openness I have to admit is pretty cool - as an environment to eat in, sure why not. On the other hand, its not so appealing to me to sit outside on a corner lot directly across from a co-go to consume my food.  Now, I know it is a lot to handle a big group of people. However, I am pretty sure the coordinator of this event called in advance. There was only one waiter serving us - which is not an easy task. On the other hand, I ordered a diet coke at the same time the five people on my table requested refills.  They all got their beers, teas, water, whatever. Me - I had to request diet coke again when she came out to take our orders 15 minutes later.   Visiting on a Sunday, we had the brunch menu. I was disappointed that there was not as much lunch food offered as there was breakfast. It was one in the afternoon and I was well past wanting to eat french toast or eggs.  They have a small handful of burgers - where the primary variety is choose the meet and then choose the options. OK - fine - if I hadn't had hamburgers that were SO GOOD at my own house.  The only other option other then wings or soup was an avocado club sandwich. So I went with that. It sounds like it has potential in the menu. It was the closest to a turkey club (something I would figure would be standard on a brunch menu) I could get. The waitress came back later and asked me what I wanted as my side, I said fries. I also ordered up a bowl of chili - my favorite food of all time.  The avocado club came out first. Essentially what sounded good in the menu turned out to be two slices of toast with sliced avocado and a sprinkling of jalapenos. There was supposed to be some sort of pesto on this as well, but I sure as heck couldn't taste it or see it. In fact, the overwhelming thought I had was - wow, um, why not just give me a plate of avocado.  Instead of fries, they gave me a side of fruit salad. **Grumble** The fries served with the burgers looked good.  The chili, if you can call it that, came out about five minutes later. It had the consistency of a beef stew, and honestly taste wise was not very far off.  OK, I AM a chili snob, I know - but come on - it's chili. And if you are calling it Jail-house chili, it should have some sort of punch - some spiciness of some sort. But really, had I not \"known\" it was chili, I would have thought they served me stew. The only bonus, they had the right kind of beef in it - you know - stew beef - or chili beef when the seasoning says its chili. :) I had to ask for cheese to put on top, which I got the look of \"huh cheese?\" but got a small little serving of that. It would have been better served with a side of jalapenos and onions to mix in too - so I stole some jalapenos from my sandwich.  Oh, and all this ample blandness cost me $20 (food, beverage and tip).  The company was at least good - and maybe if I do go back with a small group/one other person - or for breakfast or dinner I will be happier - those eating breakfast foods seemed to enjoy it though the Canadian bacon was also canned.   But as brunch and big groups go, big thumbs down - it will take a lot to convince me that this place is worth more then just a unique environment.",

Seitan wings/chunks were DELICIOUS but served in an insultingly small portion for the price. Totally realize the labor involved (if they make it in house), but c'mon. It's friggin' wheat gluten. Felt like we were shouldering some Whole Foods tax.   Fries were great. No complaints at all.  And then...potato tacos induced sadness. Mushy and watery, like all punishments to vegetarians should be. We didn't come close to finishing, we didn't ask for a box. Server didn't ask why. Apathy ruled the day.  Maybe it's a complete douche move to go to BBQ place and bitch about its vegetarian grub, but if a business is nice enough to include non-dead animal options, they should be good, right?

My salad was honestly underwhelming...the goodies I ordered on top - avocado, steak, and cheese - were in very short supply, and since you pay extra for each, that didn't go over well with me. Vinaigrette dressing way really good, though.   I appreciate the attempt at vegetarian versions of traditional barbecue and appetizer options.

At least it was a little different from the norm.",

    "text": "I've been to the Double-Wide twice for brunch now. Twice, they've mixed up the side dish for one of the plates at our table.   But their fun atmosphere and innovative breakfast items makes up for it. The huevos rancheros and the double wide benedict are both big winners - with special emphasis on the big. Their omelets are huge. Some of their items weren't as punchy with flavor as hoped, such as the breakfast burrito, but there are lots more items on the menu that I want to try.   As a vegetarian-friendly customer, I'm super-happy to see interesting veggie items like the seitan wings, lentil veggie burger, tofu scramble and avocado club.  Overall, the double wide is a good brunch location - laid back, no lines out the door, and good food. It's probably even better in the summer with their large outdoor patio area.",

The inside is definitely smaller than I imagined but then I remembered that it's crafted from a gas station and/or double-wide trailer. Our server was awesome and very knowledgeable about the menu; she brought a very warm vibe. I went here with the intention of not drinking but that quickly changed when I saw the alcohol menu and I ordered Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner. DELICIOUS! It's like a Cherry Tootsie Roll in drink form. My Blackened Shrimp Salad was excellent! Great flavor and an abundance of veggies. And then those sweet potato fries were pretty good as well. Not the best I've ever had but certainly good with the honey-cinnamon-like dipping sauce. My friends rave about the seitan wings so that's definitely on my \"try\" list when I come back, because there will definitely be a next time!",

Then I had to ask 4 times to have it reopened after the storm was over. This was after I stared at the one employee who said \"sure\" and then sat down to play on his phone.

The waitress came over right away to take our order. We ordered a few pitchers of beer and others ordered appetizers. I was surprised there weren't any drink specials going on during the game, but the prices were still reasonable. The waitress brought over new glasses immediately when someone new joined our table so they could drink from the beer pitchers. She was very attentive, but also did not come over too many times and distract us from the game. I didn't try any of the appetizers but my friends enjoyed what they ordered. Definitely recommend coming here with a group to watch the game.",

I've even used the dog patio with my furry friend.    Today, I went with a friend for a late lunch.  Food was great, service was initially fine.  My friend asked for a side salad with dinner and was advised against it by our waiter , even though after ordering it he found it to be great.  Just a weird suggestion from the waiter.  When he ordered a half order if wings, he got a full...  and was charged full price despite the waiter acknowledging it.  The real problem, though, was that when I ordered a glass of water to switch from soda, my water came back to the table in the same glass my friends daqueri was poured and that my friend drank.  I didn't initially notice this and had started drinking when I tasted the daqueri.  I looked at the glass and it was still covered in the daqueri pulp/mix.  Worse, though, when I shared this with my waiter including the fact I'm a recovering alcoholic let alone the grossness - he said \"I should have looked first.\"  Will not be returning.",

The Portabella Burger was exactly what you expect.  Nothing surprising that made the sandwich stand out. The Philly steak sandwich was great.  Nice tangy sauce and the ingredients were loaded on the bun. One thing I would have done differently is to slice the seitan in thinner slices.  The fries were tasty and crunchy and fresh tasting. The atmosphere was unique being it was formerly a mechanic garage. The prices were not bad.  Had a good size menu with several vegan and vegetarian options. We had a very friendly server who did his best to give us good service. The drawback to this restaurant is the street parking. It is paid parking.  Half the kiosk to pay don't work right. I suggest downloading the city parking app if you go.",

The few times I've been, I keep hoping for the seitan wings to get better. They haven't. Two times I got violently ill from them, and I'm not new to BBQ sauce or seitan. After that, I stopped trying. I returned once more to meet friends and only ordered the Junkyard Nachos to prevent further damage to my stomach. The BBQ sauce was definitely delicious, so I give them some credit. The food is your typical fare of bar food and basic restaurant dishes. My carnivore friends rave about the food though, so if you aren't vegan/vegetarian, it's worth a shot!  Drink specials are not bad. I've returned simply to have a drink with friends, but likely won't have a full meal involving seitan again.",

This particular visit I tried the Seitan wings which taste wings, but on the other hand does taste a little \"substitutish\", but they are good. They are made out of a wheat protein and you can have any wing sauce that they have for their regular wings and the vegetarian wings are fried up and delicious. Also had a side salad with a cilantro lime vinaigrette thats really good too. My main dish I had the Jamaican Jerk pasta with added salmon. This is spicy but really good. it comes with a like creamy sauce with jerk spice. There are little onions, peas and peppers in it as well. Its a nice size portion.",

I have had their burgers, wings, sandwiches, and many of their appetizers.  However, few things have ever stood out.  The one appetizer I would highly recommend are their Reuben egg rolls.  Very unique dish that is filling and has a great taste.  Other than these however, nothing has ever been memorable.  The service is always extremely slow.  No matter how busy it is, it always seems that we can never get in and out the place in under an hour.  The staff are always very friendly I will say though.

After 45 min or so went by the bartender said our food would be here soon but we kept seeing people who ordered way after us get their food and by this time we were starving. So another 20 min or so goes by and another bartender says it should be soon so then another 10 min or so goes by and she goes back to kitchen and comes back saying they are out of mashed potatoes and cornbread and the kitchen is closing early. Wtf? Why didn't they just come out and say that before and we would have ordered something else. Makes no sense. Bartender was nice and gave us some free drinks but kitchen staff needs to get their act together. This used to be one of my favorite places in the Southside. So disappointing.",

Given the fact that we sat as a table of 5 at 7pm on Friday night on the southside, I was expecting the kitchen to be backed up. But then again I got my food at 9pm. 2 HOURS LATER. That is just slightly crazy. Especially since the tables next to us were served a ton faster and left before we even got our food.  There was a bit of a mix up with the servers I think. There were two in the section we were seated in and nobody came over for about 45 minutes. We finally went up and asked the hostess and she sent one over to us.   We ordered two of the full orders of seitan wings with sweet bbq and garlic parm. I absolutely love these! So good and definitely shareable for a table. The bbq ones were my favorite. On the side of the garlic parm ones was a dish of the garlic parm sauce that you had to pour over, but a lot kf the garlic oil came out first, kinda drenching the wings. Spoons for that are recommended!  I ordered the shroom and swiss lentil burger with fries. The fries were SO good. Chewy and crunchy and perfectly shaped with no sogginess. The burger was really tasty, especially the mushrooms. Lots of flavor! It was huge and super messy but I loved it.  I would love to come again when it is less busy and try some more vegetarian menu items! Maybe one of the seitan sandwiches next.",

The pros of this place is definitely our sever being attentive as well as the variety of vegan options!  I ordered the BBQ brisket since it seemed like a bbq joint. The brisket was dry and the sauce helped but it couldn't mask all of the dryness.  The bbq sauce was freaking fantastic though! It had a great sweet tangy taste and the texture was more jammy, but definitely enjoyable!   The bread roll they used on my sandwich was also tasty. It was soft, chewy, and slightly sweet.",

    "text": "As a food critic from New York, I was excited to try some of the food my friends from Pittsburgh have been raving about. The first of many on my agenda was this place of business. Besides the fact that it took 23 minutes before a woman finally asked \"If we've been helped yet\", the service in general was shotty at best. I am from New York, so I am pretty desensitized to bad service, so that was not my issue. As someone whom consumes alcohol, maybe twice every 6 months, I can smell it from a mile away and it takes just a little, to make me feel hammered. I ordered a Pina Colada, with alcohol. My drink obviously had 0 alcohol in the beverage. I did not taste, smell nor feel a thing. When I NICELY asked the server about it, I was rebutted with an accusatory tone and a major attitude, with NO RESOLUTION. That ruined my entire meal. I was very nice about it, because I did not want to cause a scene, but I really wish I had not been so courteous to that uncouth maggot, you hire to serve hard working people, a meal they paid for. She did not deserve my respect, because she gave me, the patron, NONE. I have no clue how your food taste. My order was given to a buddy's 8 year old nephew. I'm sure his young palate enjoyed the ribs. I won't disclose the young serves name, because she clearly does not know any better and with that attitude, she'll need this gig for as long as she can keep it. She SUCKS and ruined my entire experience. I so regret being so nice. I will be back, but I'll be coming with buddies who have actual power in their pen, in this town. Thanks for the great introduction to Pittsburgh.",

Two strikes on the salad:  Grasshopper pee on the lettuce (what we thought dead, wilted, brown leaves were when we were kids); and balsamic dressing that looks like brown gravy.  Um, yuk.  I will say that the steak, peppers and bacon were fine.  Sweet potato fries were angel-singing fabulous.  I requested bleu cheese, but the server suggested their sugar-cinammon dip and it was terrific.  She was so right.  Loved it.  The service was excellent: happy, helpful & quick.  I might go back for the outdoor opportunity, but otherwise there's just no draw.  Another thing that made me chuckle - they weren't really busy but there were two guys handling the greeting and seating chart.  It looked like they were studying for an exam.  ...maybe they were and I'm being harsh...",

We went on a Sunday night, and we had difficulty placing an order because they were out of a lot of menu items/beers.  The hot seitan wings were pretty good, I liked that they actually had some kick to them and enough sauce to make them satisfyingly moist. The whole order though was pretty pricey for the small portion size, especially compared to seitan wings offered elsewhere in Pittsburgh (OTB, Spak bros, etc), and the wing sizes were really mis-proportioned which made splitting the order as an appetizer awkward.  They were out of vegan rolls for burgers, but I was craving a one, so I ordered the vegan lentil burger anyway on the multigrain bread. When it arrived, it had no toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle) so I had to call back the waitress to ask for them and for some mustard. The lentil patty was good, but the meal tasted like a sandwich rather than a burger. The vegetable side of zucchini and squash was pretty watery and mild, though not terrible, I regretted not ordering a different side.  I'd be willing to give this place another try, since I've heard the veggyro and vegan fries are good!",

So a few years ago we tried this place - it looks great from the outside and as we quickly discovered - terrible for the food. Fast forward to 2013 and my husband suggests we try it out again... I protest and he wins out. The food... again... not so awesome.   the good: the service is great. Our waitress was just the right amount of attentive, friendly and efficient. Lacey is why this review has two stars instead of one. I also liked how the kids menu offered a mix and match of items and included fresh, raw carrots in addition to the veggie of the day and the usual suspects of fries. My daughter had the carrots and the grilled cheese and then a cookie we decided to wrap up fro later... she was happy.   My husband was content his grilled cheese with bacon sandwich - with a side of fries.   The bad: I had the pulled pork sandwich with the lug nuts (upcharge) on the side. First, the sandwich was served open face with no sauce on the pork. There was a strange serving of something that looked suspiciously like duck sauce on the side and was very spicy... not something I would pair with pulled pork. I decided not to use it and took a bite of the naked pork - it had like zero seasoning on it. yuck. we asked for BBQ sauce which - when added -  improved the flavor but it was pretty meh.. I have made much better in a crockpot at home. Plus... mixed in with the tender bits were a number of pieces that were not braised enough - chewy and tough - sinewy even. I picked those pieces out since I decided to eat it with a knife and fork instead of as a sandwich.   Now the lug nuts looked interesting on the menu - garlic and herb potatoes... yeah, garlic - I can totally get behind that! um, the reality was what appeared to be deep fried chunks of potatoes that were fried in grease that does not taste like it was changed in quite some time. it had an off flavor to it and the garlic and herb sauce was terrible - strong flavor that ruined you for really any thing else. After a second bite with the sauce scraped off I asked for fries instead - again, Lacy was gracious and took care of me... the fries were ok - again, tasted like they were fried in old grease but it was tolerable.   I think this is it for me with the Double Wide Grill. I don't care how great it looks from the outside or how popular it seems to be. It really makes me question how discerning people can be to think it is great food and go back again and again. about 10 minutes after leaving heartburn set in and now a couple of hours later I still feel slightly sick to my stomach. No third chances... avoid at all costs. but should you decide to try it out - hopefully Lacy is your waitress.",

    "text": "Wow. I wanted to love this place, but I can't even say I liked it. The menu sounded awesome. BBQ for my hubby and some tofu action for me (I'm not a vegetarian; I just happen to like a lot of meatless dishes).  We stopped in for brunch and were disappointed left and right. The coffee was watered down and just not great at all. We ordered a grilled cheese with a side of bacon for our little nephew, and they gave us a grilled cheese with bacon on it AND on the side. Sadly, though, the grilled cheese was probably the best thing we ordered. Our meals were SO not ideal. I got the South of the Border Tofu Scramble Wrap, my husband got the Carnivore's omelet and my sister got the Breakfast Burrito. None of us were impressed. The portions were smaller than expected, the food was dry and lacked flavor, and somehow, our meals were lukewarm at best. I would hope this isn't the case, but it almost seemed like the burrito and wrap were made in advance and refrigerated, then microwaved once we ordered it. If I didn't have a Groupon to use here, I wouldn't be going back.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I ate there last Friday night, around 8:30pm. After reading the reviews, wasn't expecting much from the waiters, but was expecting a good meal. We started out with the chicken egg rolls. I absolutely did not like them. Tasted like spicy mush inside of an egg roll shell. The sauce was the look and consistency of duck sauce, but pretty tasteless to me. My boyfriend really liked them, though.  I ordered the tilapia, cajun style, with broccoli and mashed potatoes. What I got was a small, over-cooked piece of fish and undercooked vegetables. The mashed potatoes were decent (how can you mess that up?).  I left feeling hungry and cheated. $15 for a piece of fish that was smaller than my palm? My boyfriend ordered a steak and veggies. The veggies were also undercooked, and the steak was gristly. The middle of his mashed potatoes were cold.  For a $50 meal, we were expecting a lot more. Definitely will not be back.",

    "text": "I went to DWG this past summer with my wife and two sons, we were visiting Pittsburgh and I knew of this spot thru previous internet research of the city. We went on a Sunday afternoon (around 5-6pm). Not being from Pittsburgh the area wasn't the most touristy but I've lived in bad neighborhoods so I was fine. We entered and were promptly seated. I ordered my older son a grilled cheese with fries and my younger one a peanut butter & jelly sandwich with fries. Me and my wife both ordered jailhouse TV dinners. Food arrived fairly quickly and the ribs were GREAT!, very meaty and saucy. But the highlight of the meal was those potato hubcaps, I would of been content with just eating a big plate of those. When I come back to the Burgh' I will definately get a few orders of those hubcap fries. In my TV dinner I did also have the coconut rum tilipia which was gross. The TV dinner is a huge meal, I actually left some food on my plate which I normally don't do b/c I am greedy but that is testament to how much food they give you. You get to pic item item from tray one and two and then 3 sides. The sandwiches my kids got were huge, they were kind of like texas toast in thickness. They were actually able to take half the meal home and eat it later. I will definately come back for lunch so that it is nice and sunny out and we can take our orders to go and enjoy them elsewhere in Pittsburgh as this is not a family restaurant as there was a lot of cursing and smoking going on at the bar which we were seated right across from",

    "text": "I'd been craving barbecue for weeks, so with a Groupon in tow, we headed out to Double Wide Grill on Saturday night to feed our bellies.  We got there around 7, and waited 10-15 minutes for a table.  It was nice weather, so we ambled up and down the block.  You can give the host your cell number so they call when your table is ready - it was very convenient and allowed us to take a walk instead of having to hover around the host stand.  We were seated inside at a booth, and we both got a kick out of the old-service-station decor.  Maybe \"decor\" isn't the right word, since this place actually WAS an old service station, it doesn't just look like one.  Several TVs were around the room, but the volume was quiet until the Penguins started playing.  They had a pretty cool selection of draft beer - my boyfriend was very impressed and got some unusual beer.  Can't remember what it was called but it was 9% alcohol, served in a smaller glass, and he enjoyed it immensely.  They were out of Blue Moon Pumpkin so I tried something from their Wheat section - I want to say it was Southampton something or other?  It was light and refreshing.  The boy got a full rack of ribs, and I got the brisket and pulled pork platter.  Both came with cornbread, slaw, a pickle, and fries - but I got their \"hub cap potatoes\" instead.  It was a TON of food!  We could not finish it between the two of us.  We took a whole half rack of ribs home because we were simply too stuffed to proceed.  Makes you wonder how the guy on \"Man vs. Food\" can do it.  So everything was pretty much \"okay\" in my book, although my boyfriend enjoyed everything a bit more than I did.  I found everything to be too salty - I was continually going to the coleslaw and my water glass to drown out the saltiness.  I wasn't a fan of the pulled pork - the barbecue sauce used was very vinegary and tangy in a somewhat unpleasant way. The brisket was better - juicy, and with a sauce that was more sweet.  Still, it didn't blow me away - pretty standard.  The ribs were just okay too, salty and without a lot of sauce.  The best part of ribs is licking sauce off your fingers, but there wasn't much to lick!  Also, the meat separated from the bones as soon as you pulled on them - the meat slipped off before we could even take a bite, so we didn't get the fun experience of holding up a meaty rib and nomming the meat off the bone.  We were left with just a plate of meat, which wasn't quite as fun to eat.  Cornbread was good, fries were addictive, and the \"hubcap potatoes\" were okay - nice garlic flavor.  Nothing was very hot (temperature), seemed like maybe the food had been sitting for a while.  Speaking of \"a while,\" service is very slow like everyone else says.  Our waiter was certainly friendly and pleasant, but we waited a long time to be greeted, a long time for our beers, and a very long time for our food.  Sounds like that's just the way it is here.  I was feeling sort of \"2 1/2 stars\" about the whole thing, but my boyfriend was so enthusiastic about the meal that I'll go ahead and give it a 3.  If you're craving barbecue it's a fine place to go to take the edge off, but it isn't the real deal.",

    "text": "This was my third attempt at giving the Double Wide a chance.  Their food is overpriced, under seasoned and the service is spotty.  .  I ordered a chicken burrito (around $10). After waiting what seemed an unreasonably long time I received a shrimp burrito, but didn't realize it until after I had taken a bite.  I am allergic to shrimp.  I had to flag a member of the waitstaff down to let them know of their mistake, and then wait another half hour to get my chicken burrito.  Meanwhile, our regular waiter was nowhere to be seen.  The chicken burrito was probably one of the worst I've ever had. The quality of the ingredients seemed okay, it was just SO bland!  It consisted of chicken chunks with no seasoning, black beans, rice and cabbage shreds. That's it. It was served with a hand full of tri-colored tortilla chips and a \"salsa\" that was also under seasoned.  I ordered desert, an ice ream cookie sandwich. I was given 2 supermarket bakery-bought chocolate chip cookies with a scoop of ice cream between.  The only saving grace was the frozen mojito I ordered, which was VERY good.   as a whole my 3rd try was an INCREDIBLY disappointing experience, and I wont be back.  Oh-never did get an apology for the shrimp burrito AND now I have hives all over my face.",

My boyfriend is vegetarian and I am vegan, so I picked this spot because it has options for us.  It was a little tricky finding it--we were surprised to see 2341 before 2339, but once we found the right place, we walked in and were seated quickly. There is a separate vegetarian/vegan page on the menu, and items are clearly marked.  My boyfriend and I started with the seitan \"wings\" in the BBQ sauce, but they were really hunks of seitan, deliciously seasoned, and almost crispy.  For an entree, he got the Potato Tacos while I got the Tofu Skewers.  The skewers came out slathered in BBQ sauce with rice and a green bean melange.  Sadly the vegetable was forgettable, but the skewers and rice were utterly delicious.  I give them extra points for not putting broccoli, a vegetable I despise, on the skewers.  On my one visit, I found the service rather friendly (and we were wearing our Washington Capitals jerseys in Pittsburgh Penguins country), if a bit slow.  I will certainly recommend it to friends traveling to Pittsburgh and I will go back if I am ever in Pittsburgh again.",

It's a tasteful deviation of Eggs Benedict using cornbread instead of an English muffin and bacon instead of ham.  They also throw some fresh spinach under the poached eggs.  My whole meal was a little colder than I like, but still enjoyable.  When I go back, I'm definitely going earlier and trying a Bloody Mary.",

As we approached the hostess stand I was immediately told to go to the new segregated dog friendly area of the patio which was sectioned off with a small wooden fence. This came as a surprise due to the fact that the reason we had previously liked this restaurant was for it's laid back dog-friendly atmosphere. As we approached a table we were disgusted by how filthy this area was- trash all over the ground, the tables hadn't been bussed... We sat and waited for a few minutes before a server yelled across the fence to tell us that menus and silverware were available on a plastic table for us to help ourselves to. The menus were small paper take-out quality and the silverware was in a tangled mess. We felt like we were uninvited guests at a trashy house party. Needless to say we left without notice. We ended up going to Aladdin's Eatery in Mt. Lebanon where we were promptly greeted by the manager with a bowl of water for our puppy.",

Seitan wings, coconut rum tofu, and garlic tofu. The seitan wings were pretty darling, definitely a great alternative. The garlic tofu was GARLICY, woo...but not much else! The coconut rum sauce was pretty brilliant....however, the amount ladled over the tofu was not enough to flavour it impressively. The caramelized onion cilantro rice was actually the highlight of the coconut rum platter, which included bland vegetables of the day and the aforementioned rice. Not sure if the prices matched the flavour, but the portions were pretty much perfect. I want to like this place, fo' realz; the menu in theory is wonderful...maybe next time it'll hit me right!",

Atmosphere included - I kid you not - a large bald man lounging full length on a leather sofa in front of a television with an empty nacho plate in front of him - just like home! We sat in a comfortable booth.  The wings with signature hot sauce were very good without the breaded feeling that cheap wings have. The sauce was delicious - medium hot with butter and garlic notes. I'd like hotter and order \"tearjerker\" sauce on the side next time for dipping. Lots of creamy blue cheese and a few veggies. At $1 per wing these should be good.  I had turkey burger \"rebel yell jalapeno\" style, switched to cheddar instead of swiss. I thought I went with a healthier choice but probably not - greasy, very buttered roll, super thick almost compressed burger with odd sausage-like flavor, a few pickled and fresh jalapenos didn't qualify as \"rebel yell\" to me as I could have used hot sauce. Side dish of broccolini could have been skipped - over buttered, under salted, and server didn't bring utensils (my mouth was full when she checked on us and I gave up by the time she came again). Overall I'm sorry I ordered and ate most of it.  Others ordered the beef burger (extremely thick, oddly spiced), fries (described at fresh cut I expected them to look and taste more like real potatoes you know like the zoo - hmmm, maybe overcooked a bit, not very salty), brisket sandwich (meat good, bbq sauce very not nuanced).  Service was good, other than forgetting the utensils, everything was as it should be including requesting cheese switch and mustard on side.  Overall, I wouldn't return for the food. Maybe a wing or two with a beer.",

These we're surprisingly good and its not too heavy of an appetizer. You'll have plenty of room for your entree!  Go for their tv dinner combos and you'll have plenty of food and a good variety! I especially liked their cornbread! Yum!  Be careful as usually the weekend crowd rolls through and depletes their beer selection so you should try getting here later in the week. There were a couple of beers I wanted to try but they were all out on a Monday.   I would come back here for their bbq and drinks! Just was annoyed by all the bugs while I was sitting outside.",

First things first: Service= terrible. I work in a coffee shop and never should you ever let your customers just sit there for ten minutes without even asking if they want water...especially if it's slow! One of the waitresses walked past us four times, got the people in front and behind is, and didn't even say hello to us or be right with you. Service like this is really unacceptable. I would understand if it were busy, but the fact is that it wasn't.   Food: now the only reason I would ever return is the food. It's so good...and that's what makes me want to love the place. We both had seitan wings which were cooked to perfection and tasted wonderful. We also ordered a basket of fries, not worth it. They charge you 4 dollars for literally one potato worth of fries...and they weren't even good looking fries. They were soggy and cold.   So just beware going here. Good food. Bad service.",

    "text": "I did not enjoy my visit to Double Wide Grill.  They have a dog patio which seems like a good idea in theory.  I brought my gigantic 7 lb dog who i kept in my lap the whole time because this place was packed with dogs that people were not paying attention to. Also, if you have to sit in the dog section, expect the worst dining experience of your life. You are treated like you have the plague.  No one cleans the tables between customers, there is garbage on the ground everywhere.  You have to eat off Styrofoam plates and use disposable cutlery.    The icing on the cake... the waiter cannot come into the seating area so you have to go up and wait until they come back out or hope to be able to catch them as you run up there bounding over dogs.You also have to get your food when it comes out.    BUT they do not bring your food out in any particular order.  I was there with my friend and his entree came before our appetizer did. Then my dinner came out dead last after he was done eating and pretty much ready to go.  The food sounded good, but I honestly cannot say anything stood out. it was all kind of \"meh\".  I have been to many dog friendly eateries and this one may be dog friendly, but it certainly isn't people friendly. I probably won't ever come here again.",

Three servers walked in my general vicinity but did not acknowledge my presence, as each likely thought it was the other's table.  I snagged drink menus off another table, then after 10 minutes of nothing my drinking partner went to the bar to order.  It took her almost 10 minutes to order at the bar, as one server was complaining to the bartender about one of her tables, very openly, and the bartender couldn't or wouldn't concentrate.  We finished our drinks at the table, and after 40 minutes, NOT ONE SERVER STOPPED BY TO SEE HOW WE WERE DOING.   It's a shame that they have such a bad staff, and it's not just me...check out other reviews as well as FourSquare Tips...they're just atrocious.     This place has the most frustrating, worst service in Pittsburgh.  I'm never going back.",

There were seven (7!) tables open in the bar area alone (seats at the bar were 100% occupied but all the booths and small tables were vacant) and at least 1/3 of the tables outside were vacant...and on a nice evening, too (clear skies and slightly chilly in low 60s as the sun was setting). Went in to get a table and was told it'd be 30 minutes.   Yes...that's right, 30 minutes to get a table!! It's frickin Saturday evening...seat people. Either DWG cannot appropriately staff this restaurant or they have too many tables for their capacity. Either way, poor management.   I won't visit this place again even though I like the food and staff. If I have to wait 30 minutes for an available table (of many tables already available), I'll go somewhere else where I feel wanted.   Too frustrating.",

Lunch/ Dinner -- BBQ Pulled Porky - A great pulled pork sandwich, melt in your mouth good!

Annoying as in you have to ask staff for these things but they disappear and can't be found for a long time.

Only go here if you have over an hour to spend here. Every single time I've gone the service has sucked. The servers are always overwhelmed. Multiple times I've asked for things like ketchup, drink refills and even a beef patty for my dog that just never come. I usually have to get up and grab ketchup from someone else's table. All of these things have happened at least the past 4 times I've been there. There are only two people there that seem like they can actually handle it. They either need to staff more servers or hire better ones. I'm not sure why the services is so bad EVERY single time. And being that I am a server myself, this review is saying a lot. If the vegan food wasn't so good I would never go back.",

The menu is enormous, really it's far to big for the cook/s to have he time to prepaid everything fresh. I ordered the smoked ribs. The ribs were pretty over cocked, and were lacking in a smoky taste or really any taste. However they were ribs and even not great ribs are still good. The corn bread was great and the coleslaw was not great. All in all I will not be returning to the double wide grill nor would I recommend it to anyone.  I feel that the best thing the double wide grill could do for itself is simplify its menu, and give the cooks a chance to do their job.",

    "text": "Quick Review: Good food with surprisingly accessible menu (vegan, vegetarian, etc...) and great bar.   More Detail:  When I first tried Double Wide (probably 2009) I hated it. I thought the food was average at best and the service not great.   But after a long hiatus I tried it again and was pleasantly surprised (this was 2016). Now it's a favorite for our family.   I love the pulled pork and ribs, while my wife adores the brisket. I have also had their salads, burgers and sandwiches- all good. If you are indecisive try the TV dinner (build your own combo). All of the portions are huge (which is appropriate consid some meals are close to $20).  I find the appetizers to be hit or miss. Tonight we tried the buffalo dip (too much Bleu cheese for my taste). But I've enjoyed the nachos and wings previously.   The kids meals are a great deal. Drink, meal, side and dessert for $6? I like that!   Give it a shot for solid bbq and veggie/vegan options.",

Me and my bf (who is black also) went on a Sunday morning in April (after most students left) and most of the bar area was free but we were sat in the overflow indoor area...I've been there multiple times at busier times and gotten the bar area, window seats even, with my Italian friend. It wasn't until our bill racked up to about $50 did we get more attention. I loved this place but I really didn't appreciate the way we were greeted and seated.   Why seat 2 people at a 4-person table in the empty overflow indoor area away from the entrance when the priority bar area, which had seated customers and people coming in being seated there, had plenty seats available?   I worked restaurants before. All you have to do is offer the table and bus it if need be. It was a Sunday morning. Not busy at all.  And yes, we still tipped because we knew it wasn't our server's fault for the terrible seating in the back. It felt very racist. Haven't been there since.",

Built inside an old mechanic/garage, and if somehow you missed that from the outside, the decor inside makes the ties to automotive work impossible to miss (like the old truck suspended above the bar).  Good beer selection, and one of the absolute best vegan/vegetarian menus I've seen (note: I'm not vegan/vegetarian, but have enough friends who are that I try and keep an eye out for these things). Most places it feels like those options are tacked on as an afterthought, or that you're asking for something special with a list of substitutions to get a decent veggie option, but Double Wide has whole sections of the menu dedicated to it. On top of that, there's plenty of great non-veggie options as well so more carnivorous guests won't feel like they're stuck at some all-veggie place.",

    "text": "After two trips here in less than two weeks I'm highly disappointed based off my dining experience. The first time I come here with my girlfriend we ordered the vegan wings I got bbq and she the chipotle flavor. The wings came out cold, soggy and hardly covered with sauce on both of ours. Next we had side salads or house salads I can't remember exactly but they didn't seem fresh at all and the cornbread it came with tasted as if it's been sitting out and was steal. Next time I returned I brought a friend to show him all the vegan options offered. ((I didn't wanna let one bad time ruin it for me because I've been here once in the past and it was good. Honestly some of the best vegan wings I've had but I'm not sure after my last trip.)) So we go to order he likes what he sees we order sweet chili Wings to split then once we go to order our main course meal he mentioned having a soy allergy and everything is fried in soybean oil. And now the wings come out so I felt awkward being the only one eating cause they could have canceled the order and yet again there cold, soggy and hardly covered in sauce. So then turns out he can't really eat anything off the menu and the server is coming back and forth from the kitchen and finally someone came out to talk and the whole time that person stood next to us and talked to the server and the server repeated the same thing to us. The server said that was the chef so I'm just confused why she didn't talk directly to us. Next my friend ended up just getting grilled vegetables on a vegan bun. Like how sad is that that we came here to have a good business meeting dinner and he can't eat any thing he wanted cause the menu puts soy in almost everything or it's fried in it. so I had the vegan cheesesteak it looked so sad it hardly had any \"meat\" on it mostly all peppers and onions and sauce. It just disappointed me how bad the food and service has been and how I ended up spending over 35 bucks on nothing my last trip when all we had was a order of wings for happy hour grilled veggies and a vegan cheesesteak with two waters. I just don't think I'll be returning here again. I don't know if it's new cooks or new recipes or new ways of doing things or if the heat lights in the kitchen are terrible cause the foods cold but it's very off putting.",

Located inside of and on the driveway of an old gas station, this bar and restaurant offers a unique setting in a cool part of town. The staff are friendly and have a great sense of humor and they aren't afraid to engage in conversations with patrons.  The biggest thing this place has going for it is the happy hour. I was able to get two beers and some food for under $10! I don't know how this place stays in business with prices so low. They have an extensive beer and alcohol menu and I was very impressed with the meatless food menu. Most dive bars wouldn't go out of their way to cater to those with weird dietary choices but this place does and they deserve credit for that. I would highly recommend the satay hot wings.  Overall, I was very impressed with this bar and restaurant. If for no other reason, grab a quick beer to check out the wacky decor. I would highly recommend this place while on Pittsburgh's south side.",

It satisfies (well, more than satisfies) everyone from the hardcore carnivores, broccoli chomping vegetarians, grass fed bisons and vegans such as myself.  I got the \"Vegyro\" (sounds so sexual) the last time I stopped in topped off with some tangy Margaritas... really good! Our waitress was cool as hell!

Ehem... management,.. she should be commended / given a monetary prize if you can figure out who it was.  The whole back side of the menu is for vegans... this place is in \"french-fries-and-fried-eggs-on-everything-pierogi-happy\" Pittsburgh?!   Terrific beer selections, really friendly staff, and a comfortable atmosphere in my favorite section of town, South Side.  Why 4/5 stars? I'm strictly basing it on deliciousness I've had every time I've been in there. Not over the top \"You SOOO need to go!\", but definitely recommended.",

That being said, I have had Turrible T-u-r-r-i-b-l-e service there more than once, and from different waiter/waitresses. They don't really seem to care if you need anything or want anything, and even when you ask, sometimes you don't get. I have also had food come out two shades gray of luke warm and then come back definitely microwaved, yet still delish...  Overall, if you have time to wait and tons of patience (or are drunk) go there, they have good food and beer. If you are in a bad mood or rushed, skip it.",

If it were up to me I wouldn't choose to go back, but my friends love it.  Why they love it - a couple reasons, it does have a good vegan/vegetarian menu (clearly I don't fall in that category based on my menu choices above) but they said its really good for vegans/vegetarians. Also, they have the outside patio which is nice for dogs!  Overall it's a good atmosphere, but I just don't like the food.",

My most recent experience there was after an exhausting bike trip and me and a few girlfriends stopped to fuel up. I ordered a shrimp salad that was awesome. The shrimp was blackened and cooked perfectly. The corn and avocado were great and the dressing was tasty. This was the first time I was excited about something I have ordered from Double Wide. Unfortunately, we had met one of the husbands who brought a dog. Double Wide has a dog area, which is wonderful, but I just don't understand the service. You are supposed to walk up to a counter area and order, which is fine, but it's almost impossible to get someone's attention to order.  I will probably go again but i will sit somewhere  where the waitress actually comes up to the table.",

Also, as soon as I picked up the menu, I noticed that, in addition to the huge variety of regular diner/pub fare, DWG also has options for kid's, gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian. Pretty impressive.  I started with an order of the Tijuana Rice Balls (Arborio rice, sun-dried tomatoes, black beans, melted cheddar cheese, chili pepper seasoning; Panko breaded and deep fried; Served with chipotle ranch). Although they were some of my favorite ingredients, they were also fairly bland on the seasoning and a little greasy. The dipping sauce was decent.  For my entree, I had a pulled pork, bacon, black beans, and pineapple salsa wrap. The Carolina vinegar-based BBQ sauce was tangy - and the pork was moist - but, on the whole, I didn't think the burrito was that special.  Unfortunately, our service was really slow (though friendly); and, I thought the bill was a bit much for the quality of food. Also, on a side note, my son's chicken tenders were little more than soggy breading and frozen chicken - and his fruit was old melon and pineapple...not really the kind of fruit most kids enjoy.  Overall, I'd say if you're stuck in the South Side with your kids or a large group, then you might consider the DWG. Otherwise, I don't think it's worth the visit.",

There were so many good options for both of us. I got the seitan wing-bits and the vegan gyro. The house hot sauce is very good. A little bit of heat with a little vinegary zing. The gyro was loaded with all kinds of good stuff. My brother also said his meal was very good. They had a nice big beer menu too, with a lot of brews I recognize and even some I didn't. Though, since we just got done exercising, drinking wasn't on the agenda.  The waiter was plenty nice and attentive. Though, being as it was only about 15 degrees out, the place was kind of empty. The interior design is pretty cool, kind of a throw back to classic cars and gas stations.  If I lived in Pittsburgh I would visit place often. They pretty much have something for everyone here.",

Service was prompt and out server was able to answer every question we had about the menu. She really made us feel very welcome. I opted for chicken, coleslaw and sweet potato fries.

However, I was super disappointed on my most recent visit when I saw that their once-very-extensive menu had changed to a simple one pager, and that a lot of my boyfriend and I's favorite menu items were no longer there.  The two things about Double Wide that made it unique in my opinion were the cheddar grits side, and the create your own TV dinners. Neither of those are on the regular menu anymore! Cheddar grits are only available for brunch now, and replacing the create your own TV dinner option is a few preset TV dinner entrees with, of course, no substitutions. It was really upsetting to see that the only vegetarian TV dinner was very obviously made with the cheapest side options (fries, broccoli) instead of the more unique options that you used to be able to choose from.  We were disappointed with the menu changes and expressed that a bit to our waitress, nothing over-the-top or dramatic. But she very noticeably ignored us for the rest of our meal, only checking on us once after we flagged her down, while she made sure to check on the table next to us multiple times. The disappointing menu changes and poor service makes me sad to say that this isn't the Double Wide that I once adored for their vegetarian and vegan options, and I'm not sure if I'm going to be back.",

    "text": "A couple of my friends and I stopped in here for a break during one of our weekend bike rides. It's really accommodating for bikers, with a bike rack outside, and a whole bike maintenance station!  There are a bunch of tables outside. You can bring your dogs out on the patio and they have water bowls readily available for your pet. We chose to sit inside though because we wanted a break from the heat.  It wasn't crowded inside (or outside for that matter), so we were seated right away. Our server was extremely friendly and attentive. Our waters never got more than half empty before she filled them back up.  Our food was delicious. I got the Cali-forn-i-a salad with lemon cilantro dressing. It was perfect for a summer afternoon. Everything was really fresh and the dressing wasn't too sweet. I would come back again!",

    "text": "Mixed bag here with Double Wide grill. They have a big menu with BBQ options, appies, vegetarian, and sandwiches. We got an order of boneless wings which were nice and crispy, tender on the inside, and came with good buffalo sauce. We also got a pulled pork platter. The pork was not super flavorful, but the fries were great (skin still on) and it came with a nice serving of cole slaw.  They also have a large drink menu with many beers on tap. My girlfriend got a good sour beer.  Some other reviews on here have mentioned the service and I also found it slow. We went on a Saturday night but it wasn't too crowded. Still our server had a bit of an annoyed attitude and our food took nearly a half hour to come out. Not great.  They have a nice large patio area which can open up to the inside seating area when the weather is nice. I could see that being a good setting for happy hour and/or just a nice outdoor meal. I went during a July heat wave so the patio was pretty empty.",

The wait staff is always speedy and attentive, the food is delicious and reasonably priced, and the atmosphere is inviting. This is a great stop for friends or families of all ages.   I ordered the beyond burger with sweet potato fries and a side of vegan cheese dip. It was a perfect portion. I love how friendly this restaurant is for dietary restrictions. Additionally, I joined their birthday list. This means, on your birthday, you get up to $15 towards any entree. Great deal!! Aside from all of the food, Double Wide Grill also has an extensive drink menu worth trying out. I absolutely recommend this place to anybody!",

    "text": "I was neither terribly impressed nor overly disappointed by Double Wide. I'd consider it a solid option to get food which is neither mediocre nor outstanding.  Perhaps the most annoying aspect of my visit was learning that certain menu items - namely the brisket and Cuban sandwiches - are not available until 5 & 2 pm respectively. The explanation I was given was that those items \"take, like, y'know, all day to prepare\". Cool. Really wish the menu available through Maps had noted that as I'd gotten to the restaurant around 1:50 pm and had specifically chosen it after running a quick search for convenient barbecue spots.  Allow me to be clear: I don't think Double Wide qualifies as a barbecue joint; certainly at least not a quality one. The menu is varied and quite inclusive of vegetarian options, but considerably lite on barbecue options. I've learned my lesson on that score and certainly won't be take to sate my brisket fix.  Service wasn't great - took my asking multiple times to receive a glass of water - but also wasn't horrid - I received exactly what I'd ordered, and was checked on a few times.  Overall, Double Wide is...an option. It won't wow you, but it also shouldn't wooow you.",

The big draw for me to this place is their outdoor seating, they have tons of it though the patio space is kind of a cluttered mess and Carson Street can be chaotic to sit next to. I went here for the tail end of happy hour (5-7) but was disappointed that they only offer it at the bar, I hate when places do that. The service was okay, our waitress was very patient with the toddler that was with our group. They had a carseat holder for the 4-month-old with us which was very much appreciated. They have a large menu and prices are reasonable if not a little on the higher side for what you get. I had the BBQ Pulled Porky sandwich though turned it into a wrap. It was fine, the sauce was the best part. Overall, I'd say it's worth a visit.",

Husband had the  Two 2 To Too with eggs, canadian bacon, pancakes (with sugar free syrup) and rye toast.  Our friend had the eggs benedict, which looked fantastic!

I opted for the Aloha Burger (vegan sandwich with a lentil patty that was so good I can't stop talking about it, pineapple, arugula, and their Texas bbq sauce) served with excellent fries.

For dinner, I had the meatloaf special with a side of mashed potatoes and a fantastic large piece of broccoli cooked to perfection.  My mom had the brie and portabella mushroom and my dad opted from the pulled pork sandwich.  No complaint from either of them. Service was fast and attentive.  We were there at an off time - around 4:30 PM on a Saturday so it wasn't crowded, however, the staff was all great.",

They fall off the bone, not fatty, tender, flavorful!! I LOVE the Carolina BBQ sauce!!! The sides were great too.  I had the creamy cherry cole slaw, cheesy grits, sweet potato fries and yummy cornbread - all delicious.  It is a fun automotive theme atmosphere.   We came here with about 20 people and they did a great job for us!  Thanks guys!!",

Only beer on tap and food from the deep frier were available - but um, what else would I want late at night in South Side?? So bring it on!  We got hot and also barbecue seitan \"wings\" with blue cheese dressing, and loads of raw veggies. The seitan plates were pretty small, but clearly delicious, because we devoured all of it. Even the obligatory celery sticks.  They have a pretty solid beer menu, and the wait staff wear the most charming grease-monkey one-piece suits. It sounds like I'll have to return in summer to get some of that outdoor seating.",

Similar feedback for my hubby's buffalo chicken salad.

I kept it simple and ordered a cheeseburger and a cup of fruit. I ordered the burger medium. When my burger cam there was a very thin line of pink and it was only a degree or two from being well done. If you've read my reviews you know my belief is basic menu items should be cooked perfectly. That's the foundation of every plate you make. I was very bummed that my burger was overcooked. It is rare that I send food back. I usually just cross it off my list of places to go. Consider this one 'd off.",

We were thrilled to discover that Double Wide Grill had lots of vegetarian/vegan options and was just a short walk from the Holiday Inn Express we were staying at.  Double Wide Grill is a fun diner style restaurant with a car/gas station theme. There was a beer chandelier directly above our table. I didn't get a photo of the outside of the restaurant, but it had a nice outdoor area where dogs can hang out too!  We ordered a full order of the seitan wings ($9.79) with Cletus' signature hot sauce. It also came with ranch dressing and some veggies. This was quality seitan. Very tender. We gobbled it up really quickly. I'm not one to shy away from junk food, especially when I'm on vacation.   We also shared the BBQ Pulled Seitan ($9.29), which was delicious! The multi grain vegan bread was perfect with the seitan. It wasn't stringy like pulled pork, but was sliced into thin, tender strips and had a good texture. Good stuff.  For beer, I got the Thirsty Dog Old Leghumper. It was a tasty American Porter that paired well with all the seitan, but let's be honest, I clearly ordered it just so I could say that I've had a beer called Leghumper!",

Sitting outside on their patio drinking a Corona almost makes me feel like I'm at the beach. Whether you have a big group, or your only getting dinner or drinks for two, there's a seat for you on the patio.   Double Wide's menu has a huge selection. And don't be turned off by the fact they specialize in BBQ if you're vegetarian. There's a full two pages of vegetarian option on the menu. Despite all these options though, many times when I'm there, I always end up turning back to my favorite meal, the Porky Pineapple Burrito. I love love love their pulled pork. If you do get a BBQ'd item, it's good to know that they serve their BBQ sauce on the side. I think this is nice because some people like their meat lightly sauced while others like a lot of sauce. But if you're expecting it to be all in one it can be a little different.  The service is friendly There have been times I've waited a little longer than normal for food, but when I'm sitting outside enjoy whatever I'm drinking I really don't mind so much. Certainly one of my go-to's on the Southside!",

They also have a fairly good kids menu compared to other places and give children more options than french fries and chicken fingers.  Every time we come here are food is served fairly quickly. I usually get the pulled pork platter and their bbq sauces are AWESOME, it's probably why I rated this place so high, just on the sheer deliciousness of those sauce alone. They go great with french fries or one of the meat selections (pulled pork, ribs, brisket, etc.  I love that fact that they have a doggie patio for the pet parents. I don't have a pet but it's nice to know thats one of the few restaurants who offer that option in the summer.   The drink selections are also nice. We have opposite taste buds, I like my drinks more on the refreshing side, light, lots of fruits and berries, smooth, etc,  He likes his beverages strong, dark, with very rich flavor, etc, and we are always able to find a good drink to fit us both.   It is slightly overpriced, nothing too outrageous. I think the last time we went here we spent over $60 for 2 adults and one child. I say \"slightly\" because you do have to factor in the amount for 2 beers and a mixed drink.   Overall this place is pretty good. They get the stars mainly for the bbq sauce selection, the tender perfectly cooked brisket, and the optional outdoor seating in the summer months where you have the option to bring your pet.",

Big drink menu including some frozen concoctions such as blended mojitos and mudslides.  Huge TVs and lots of them, so I can imagine this place will be great to watch a game at.

    "text": "We went on Saturday night to satiate my craving for good karaoke.   For food I ordered the \"TV dinner\" which is a huge metal tray of two entrees and three sides. I tried the pulled pork, half rack of ribs, cornbread, mashed potatoes, rice, and veggie of the day. The ribs were falling off the bone and tender, but could have used extra sauce. The pulled pork was dry and really needed extra sauce, and the texture seemed off. The sides were all pretty much awful. You could tell they make a big batch in the morning and it sits there all day. In addition they were all vastly underseasoned. My husband had the black and blue burger, which strangely enough he said was OVERseasoned. So the food was pretty much disappointing, but you do get a lot for the price, and I'll give them the benefit of the doubt since they stop serving food at 11pm and we came at about 10:40. Next time we will try eating there earlier.   The service was fine; the waitress checked on us frequently and promptly. They do have a good beer list and the beer prices are okay, although the mixed drink prices are a teensy bit high for my tastes (although probably comparatively low for some South Side venues). The restrooms were cleaned and fully stocked, which is a plus for such a busy bar. Speaking of busy, the place was packed when we came, and they do boast an awesome patio that probably more than doubles their seating capacity.  The karaoke was AWESOME. It really saved this place from getting a two star review. They had a great, lively crowd doing some really zany and entertaining performances. The host has the best karaoke setup I've seen: live video background of you singing, playback clips of your performance, and a VERY up to date computerized catalog. If anything, I'll be back for his karaoke! We'll give the food a second shot another day.",

    "text": "My wife, son, and I decided to stop at the Double Wide yesterday after a nice long walk on the Heritage Trail.  We've been to the Double Wide more than a few times and our experiences there have always been positive.    We asked to sit inside so we could cool off after a long walk in the sun.  We were seated in the open-air dining room, which was fine since it afforded a little shade.  The amount of flies were freaking my toddler out a little, but some flies are to be expected in an open-air dining room.  Our server was initially prompt and friendly.  She arrived with two waters and even a water for our son in a kids cup, which we appreciated.  My wife ordered a cheeseburger, and I was in a mood for a Pittsburgh salad so I ordered the Double Wide Salad with grilled chicken and fries.  We ordered chicken fingers and a fruit cup for our son.  The food arrived quickly, but this is when things started to go downhill.  My wife's burger would be classified as \"Pittsburgh rare\" even though she didn't even order it medium rare.  It was so undercooked that some of the edge areas were still red.  My salad came without fries, and my son's chicken fingers without dipping sauce (which my wife subsequently ordered from the food runners).  No big deal, I thought.  I'll just trade meals with my wife and eat the rare burger (I couldn't).  10 minutes or so went by before our server checked on the food.  By that time, I had given up on the fries and my wife had only taken one bite from the burger (I also took a bite when I thought I might eat it).  My son's dipping sauce also never arrived.  My wife politely returned the burger and the server noted that she could \"probably\" get it removed from the bill.  No apology or offer of some kind of replacement.  My wife and I have both spent a significant amount of time in the service industry, and were ready to write the experience off as an isolated bad day.  When the bill arrived, we were relieved to see that the burger had been removed.  However, there was a $.50 charge for the ranch dressing that never came, and another $1.50 for the fries that never arrived.  We weren't about to hassle the server over $2, so I paid the bill and we left.  In the end, we spent $40 (with the tip) for what amounted to be chicken fingers, a cup of fruit, a grilled chicken salad, an iced tea ($2.50), and a Bloody Mary (which was great).  Reflecting back on the experience on the way home, we decided we would not be returning.    We'll miss the Double Wide, but there are too many great places to eat in Pittsburgh now to risk a repeat experience.",

    "text": "I don't know how many times I passed by this place before realizing it was actually an eatery and not some old shut-down gas station.  I am glad that I finally found it, though.  My only issue on this trip was that I had Sophie with me.  Oh well, into the jacket she went, and into the restaurant we went.    Amazingly tchotchky interior, but amazingly appropriate for the location, the history, and surprisingly not overdone.  Not a lot of other customers, but we were in at around 3pm -- a time when most other people are not eating.  Looking through the menu, I was surprised to find \"Tear Jerker\" flavor for the hot wings.  My first thought was, \"BAH!  People in Pittsburgh don't know what piquant is and that is what I will be getting.\"  I then ruffled through the rest of the menu and we ordered the following items:  5 regular wings 5 tearjerker wings split pea soup with ham potato soup DW Cheeseburger (plain/medium) with fries Pepsi (x2)  I am uncertain about the full gamut of the menu, but they appeared to be fairly hospitable to those that were looking for gluten-free food as well as having many vegetarian and vegan options that were clearly marked on the menu.    Our soups and drinks came out right after we ordered.  I didn't like the Split Pea soup.  It was grainy and tasted like it had just come out of a package.  I had a few bites and then just set it to the side.  I used my soda to wash the flavor from my mouth.  I didn't even bother to try the potato soup.  Not to long after I aborted soup consumption, the wings arrived.  My nose immediately caught the fragrance.  Oh...the smell was good.   My friend made it clear that I was not to have any of the regular since he was not going to eat any of the tear jerkers.  After having finished my scoffing at him, I went right for my wings.  The flavor was good.  They didn't burn.  I knew it; I continued on eating them leisurely while drinking my soda.  On the third wing, my nose, eyes and mouth burst into flames.  I couldn't believe it.  My complacency had caused me to be unprepared for the piquancy.  The delayed ignition only hurt my pride a little compared to my friend laughing at my running nose and the tears coming out of my eyes.  As I finished the fourth wing, the hamburger arrived.  I abandoned my last wing while I cut the burger in half.  It appeared to be more a medium-well than a medium temperature; this is a heads up to order a temperature lower.  The flavor was good and the meat wasn't overly dry.  I will order a medium-rare next time so that I get the proper temperature.  When I finished the burger, I ate the last wing.  I will return here.  There is no question about it.  I enjoyed the flavor of the wings, but next time I will not be unprepared.",

    "text": "The Doublewide embodies a lot of conflicting emotions for me.   PRO: I believe they have the greatest seitan wings & pulled seitan sandwiches in town - this can go a long way for a vegetarian.  CON: I am decidedly uncomfortable with their version of \"Southern garage\" culture. Section 8 meals? Oh god. I'm actually from a place with Southern \"hick\" mechanics, and it is a little excruciating to see realities be turned into themes.   PRO: Their beer draft lift is exciting, with a nice balance between old friends and new adventures.  CON: The brunch is gross. Veggie menu options are slim and everything we ordered was just gross. Brunch is very important to me, almost sacred.   The service is almost always fantastic, though, the servers are quick and knowledgeable. The food is solid & portions are manageable yet filling, but the seitan wings are a-mazing. I think the price point is a little high, but I guess it's alright to indulge in dressed-up down-home faves occasionally. The chairs and tables are big & sturdy, and the decor is some creative mash-up of a service station and a shiny corporate restaurant.   Good place to take a date: It's not so loud you can't talk, and I've never been gay-bashed there or anything.",

We split the sauces - barbeque and hot - both really extraordinary and the texture of the Seitan is, well, like meat. The onion rings are also amazing. They got the breading just right - it sticks to the onion so you don't end up pulling the onion out of the breading by accident. The rings come with a really tasty  chipotle ranch sauce with a lot of flavor and a little kick.  And then there's the beer. They rotate their selection frequently so you never know what you're going to get. That ends up being half the fun. The staff have been reliable at providing advice in this realm. But with a name like Uppity Jag Off IPA, ya have to try it, right? I loved it. Not too hoppy as IPA's go....very tasty with the added benefit that it's difficult to forget the name.  Great place!",

I ordered the Double Wide Benedict and devoured it quickly, mostly because I was starving at the time. The order was nothing spectacular, but it was a solid plate. The poached eggs were nicely done, and the hollandaise was good. They have a regular Eggs Benedict, but the Double Wide is unique because it is on corn bread rather than the English muffin. The salty sweet combo made it different and rather enjoyable.   If you're looking for some outdoor dining, they have a nice area outside, which they call their patio - good for daytime brunch in the sun, or getting some fresh air with your beer during happy hour.   Also look for their specials - ribs night and happy hour/night specials. I haven't been here for drinks yet, but they do have a nice draft selection. I'll be sure to check it out soon!",

And for those of you from Chicago, I don't mean the \"fun-crammed-down-your-throat-with-a-toilet-plunger\" atmosphere of Ed Debevics.  It's a place to simply go an enjoy yourself.  So I was out with my girl posse on Friday night.  We were going to the movies nearby at South Side Works, so we wanted a place nearby to have a casual meal.  We started our meal with some wood grilled veggies, which were delicious.  They have an interesting concept here called \"TV Dinner On Trays\" in which you can build your own platter by choosing 1 \"On Tray\" and 3 sides for $15.99.  Marla tried that and wimped out 1/2 way through it, so she took some home.  Sherry tried the barbecue chicken ranch salad.  Maryann went for the wood-grilled chicken burrito.  And then there was Susan.  Sometimes Susan gets really hungry.  Sometimes Susan wants just a plain ole good cheeseburger.  And there's only one type of meat that Susan acknowledges as a burger--beef!  No turkeyburgers, no ostrich burgers, and certainly no veggie burgers will do.  Besides, veggies are a side dish, not a main dish.  Oh, and Susan's cheeseburger?  Yummy medium well with grilled onions.",

    "text": "When I lived in Pittsburgh, I ate here quite a few times.  On a recent visit back to the 'burgh, I met up with some friends to recollect and enjoy some vegetarian-friendly fare.  The Double Wide has a cool vibe because of the refurbished garage/gas station environment.  The memorabilia and decor capitalize on the history, so there's plenty of old gas-station signs, old oil cans, old hubcaps (...you get the idea) to look at.  The menu also playfully embraces the location's history, with plenty of old-time diner options, BBQ, and burgers.  The twist, of course, is that there are plenty of options for vegetarians and vegans.  Tofu and seitan abound.  The outdoor seating provides the perfect vantage point for people-watching and for observing all the craziness and/or quirkiness of Carson Street.   While this is all fine and good, there's really nothing spectacular about the food or service.  The greeters and waitress weren't particularly cheery, and the food is a bit underwhelming.  I suppose if I was a vegetarian, I'd be much more delighted.  Still, it's an okay place to check out, especially if you're visiting the South Side.  Try to get a table outdoors when the weather's nice (and when Pittsburgh experiences a rare sunny day).",

I started off with a bellini, and was very confused when it came out with a red color to it and a cherry at the bottom. It seemed like a rose/fruit wine, not peach puree and sparkling wine. I was willing to look past it and enjoy the brunch with a friend that I had not seen in awhile, except one of the waitresses kept yelling all over the restaurant to the rest of the staff. She was not yelling in a mean way, but in a conversation way, but she was the ONLY one yelling, why not walk up to the people...she made the whole restaurant comfortable with her very loud talking.   Now on to my, Double Wide Benedict. I had such high expectations for this..but after the first bite I knew I made the wrong choice. The corn bread, bacon and eggs complimented each other so well, but as soon as the spinach came into play it went downhill fast. It just didn't taste great all together, unfortunately IMO.   All around the food was good, and my friend and I had fun, but I now know not to order when I go back. :)",

My father and I went with the Pulled Porky sandwiches; my mom got the burrito; and my brother and his girlfriend went with Salads (darn them and their healthiness)... I LOVED the BBQ and the sauce-on-side was lovely as well.  It doesn't look like typical BBQ sauce, but it rivals it in my opinion.  Even my father (73 and a persnickety eater) loved the BBQ and sauce.  Put on the sauce in moderation, however, as it does have some 'kick'.  A good place for family eating - as the kids were kept entertained by the atmosphere and decorating; and the adults were kept entertained by the people-watching, exceptionally friendly service-staff, and good conversation.  Keep up the good work and looking forward to coming back to relax on the patio for a lazy Saturday afternoon.",

The execution could be better as the meal that I ordered was a bit over done and the meal my sweetie ordered was a bit under done.    I got a grilled portabello reuben sandwich and the mushroom was oddly overcooked.  Also the sauce was sort of off.  I can't put my finger on it exactly but it didn't have zest perhaps?  Also the fries were a bit soggy...  My sweetie got the grilled veggie burrito and her veggies were under done (well a bit raw).  Nice sauce though.  Service is prompt and friendly but a bit distracted.  The outdoor seating is nice though.",

Your choice of two mains, three sides, and cornbread. I've had all the BBQ and it's all good. The sweet potato fries are great too: they come out crispy and not too soggy. The reuben egg rolls are another good unique Pittsburgh item. I'd go back to this place.",

It's a great place to just kick back and relax, sit outside, play some cornhole, and enjoy some adult beverages.   The food was very forgettable but that's really not why you we went there. We actually ended up ordering a pizza to be delivered there and they let us eat it which I thought was pretty cool.   And there are a lot of dollar drink specials on the SS but this is not one of them. Over the course of a day I think I spent the equivalent of an actual double wide but I had such a good time there that I didn't really mind.   With some upcoming events in the Burgh this summer I'm sure we'll be hitting up the Double Wide for the clean Burgh air and some Iron Citys'.",

There is a lot of outdoor sitting, which makes it ideal for the summer time.  The service was fast and helpful. The drinks were solid and the food even better! Two of us order the pulled pork sandwich and it was as good as it gets, while their vegetarian selection is huge and great (based on the vegetarians of our group).  All in all, I think it is worth a try if you have not visited the place and I am sure you will like it.  Only negative point, is that they could use some more care in the facility - it looks dirty and old (which of course does not necessarily mean that it is, but it could use some more care).",

The only reason I am giving them two stars is because I have had experiences where the food was good (Brunch, Seitan Wings, various awesome vegetarian items that are available), however, more than often to the food is not great. I love the huge out door seating and the fact that there are so many great healthy but still enticing options to choose from on the menu, yet I only really enjoy the food probably half the time.  One thing you can count on being awful is the service. Waiting forever for a table, getting to a table and waiting forever to have someone come serve you, bad attitudes and bad service are all regular occurrences at Double Wide. I think I am a pretty low maintenance customer, and I certainly can be patient and understanding. Yet I have given Double Wide so many chances and am usually disappointed or offended. I would much rather go to OTB or Library, which both have way better food and are a block away.",

I want to rave about the food because their menu is interesting, but everything I've ever had has just been okay. The servers have always come off as somewhat rude. On numerous occasions, I've had to wait when there are plenty of open tables as they are always understaffed. As everyone has already pointed out, their outdoor seating is great, but if you come at a busy time, be prepared to wait for it.  Their prices aren't outrageously bad, but you can get much, much better for your money elsewhere in Southside. Bottom line, unless you're from out of town and want this experience, go somewhere else.",

If you want to have lunch in the Southside and you want to sit outside there aren't many options, so Double Wide might be your only choice.  If so stick to the salads as they are above average.  Everything I've ever tried apart from salads though has been a disappointment, and salads aren't what I'm normally trying to order (even though it probably should be).  If you sit inside though you will be greeted with a nice smell of stale beer that seems to have infested every inch of the place.  It's a shame too, because I do enjoy the layout and atmosphere.  If they just focused a little more on the quality and taste of the food I think this place would be amazing.    My recommendation is to avoid unless you really want to sit outside.",

    "text": "Ok people, how is it that the last time I visited here was nearly four years ago and I forgot about it?  But subconsciously I somehow remembered what I ordered.  How?  Is?  That?  Possible?  I don't know what it is about a burger that has an egg and bacon on it that attracts me like bees to pollen (no, it's not bees to the honey, but that is another rant for another time).  I'm thinking that it's the appeal of breakfast, but the satisfaction of dinner that does it.  To say that this burger is big does not do it justice, to describe this you should use gut-buster.  This amount of food that you are holding in your two hands is enough to send you into a food coma.  Two thick slices of toasted to perfection Texas toast try their best to keep your hands grease free for as long as they can, but in all honesty, you should just accept the fact that there is no way you are getting out of there without using a stack of napkins.  The burger patty itself is cooked to your liking with the right amount of spices.  The egg is your basic fired egg, nothing special about it, but somehow definitely belongs on this burger.  The bacon people, my god, what is our obsession with bacon, I'm not complaining, but why in the world does it makes EVERYTHING better!  This bacon just crumbled once it hit the tongue.  Crumbled into salty goodness that makes your heart smile.  Yes it was that good!  It took me so long to eat this monster that I was lucky that my friend had gotten one of their TV dinners.  The side was nothing more that fresh cut fries.  I'm not going to go much into that as if you read my previous review how upset I was at that change.  Our server needed a little work.  Very monotone and kind of reminded me of Sam the Eagle from the Muppets.  All in all, it was a good experience.  Hopefully one I won't forget the next time around.",

    "text": "Well. I realized that I am LONG overdue for my first-ever review update, and what better place than Double Wide, a place that I went from loathing to loving. (Okay, not *loathing* so much as *being kind of weirded out by and disappointed in*. But definitely to *loving*!)  Every year, I help run the Pittsburgh chapter of National Novel Writing Month. We are an unruly bunch of writers, some of us meat eaters, some vegan, some of us gluten free, and all of us really really hungry before the month begins in November. So, we gather at the end of each October to get together and eat and chat before the stress of the month turns us into a bunch of crazy sleepless writers.  Our old spot was no longer working out, so a friend recommended we try Double Wide a few years back. I was skeptical - my initial visit in 2011 was less than enthralling - but I agreed to try. A small group of us went in for brunch to eat and chat with the staff about hosting our event.   I have never once regretted our decision to start using Double Wide as our Kick-Off Party headquarters, and we have been back three years in a row now.  Our group ranges from 25-40 people, and each year, the staff has handled us with ease. Lots of menu options to choose from? No problem. Separate checks? They don't bat an eye. Special menu items for our friends with dietary restrictions? They are ON IT.  I really can't say enough good things about the staff. They are just fantastic, from the management, to the servers, to the chefs who put out all sorts of tasty snacks.  Seeing as how I can't teleport back to my experience in 2011 and check myself, I'm going to assume that we just visited on an off-night, because it's been nothing but awesome on our last several visits to Double Wide.  #1. The salads are huge and terrific and come with CORNBREAD. A+++++  #2. In the summer, you can come mid-bike ride on the GAP and they don't care if you are smelly as heck!  #3. YOUR DOG CAN COME HAVE DINNER WITH YOU IN THE SUMMER. (Haven't tried this one out yet, but the first nice day of 2017, Miss Layla Grace is hitting up the Double Wide patio!)  #4. Drinks are cheap and yummy.  #5. Seriously the service is the best. Every server is amazing.  #6. They are not scared off by your massively large unruly group, and they are easy to get in touch with, easy to schedule, and they follow up and everything is heaven for scheduling.  #7. They will refill your water ten billion times during dinner, and I know this seems like a minor detail, but it is actually very important. Because, you know, hydration for your health and all that. ::love::  So yes. I'm still not huge on the trailer park decor, but WHATEVER I'm a convert and I love this place. Thank you, Double Wide, for welcoming me back after a not-very-impressed first visit and showing me that there is beauty in the South Side after dark. :)",

And while the decor was funky, fun and the ideal patio drinking location, I had to give it -2 stars for the consistently inconsistent food from the kitchen.  Don't get me wrong, the food was fun and appealed to all palates and dietary needs. My boyfriend and I could tear up some serious Junk Yard Nachos and my gaw, their Chicken Bonanza should be illegal for how tasty it is.   I just hope they've changed the recipe for their turkey burger. I am extremely sensitive to the food service industry. I worked my way through high school and college in almost all job descriptions at restaurants. I've never sent food back. Ever. But the turkey patty was not the ground turkey style you'd typically expect. It was cold, minced turkey mush and it looked like it wasn't cooked through. If it were beef, I probably would have been fine, but because turkey can cause more foodborne illnesses, I got nervous. The server was apologetic, but explained that their patties are different. I wish the menu indicated that.  We never made it for brunch, but I have no doubt its awesome. This is a fabulous spot in the spring to sit outside or inside for Karaoke in the fall. Solid spot. If you're on East Carson Street, give it a go.",

We ended up waiting 30-40 minutes for a salad and a burger. Two tables next to us that ordered after us received there food and were almost finished by the time we actually received ours. Our server checked in with neighboring tables but never ours, not even to apologize for how long it was taking for our food and that it would be out shortly (even if it wasn't). Then once our food finally came, our server never stopped by to make sure everything was ok. The food was mediocre at best. We were then brought the wrong check. Overall this place isn't the worst place I've been to, but won't waste my money again. Especially since Pittsburgh has so many other great options. I wouldn't recommend this place.  In regards to the food. My salad was enormous(which isn't necessarily a bad thing) but had way too much of each topping on it, could barely taste the kale and spinach. This might be for some people but not me...less is more when it comes to salad toppings. Especially when you advertise local produce...I actually want to taste it. The cornbread was over cooked and dry. The burger was also just ok, if it truly is grass fed beef, it shouldn't need as much add in seasoning as it had. Again, this place is just ok. When you have a menu as big as theirs, you can't expect the food to be that great.  My advice would be to retrain your servers and cut the menu in half. Focus on making things really good instead of just making a bunch of things just meh.",

    "text": "This place is atrocious!  AVOID!  Visited on Feb 7, 2018 for lunch. The place was completely empty except for us for about 15 minutes. One other family arrived and believe it or not, they sat them in the booth right next to us!!! The entire place was EMPTY! WTF???  We immediately felt uncomfortable and discussed moving as soon as we received our food. It was too late, though, the mood was killed and we just wanted to leave, but we'd already ordered.   I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak Soup and an order of two pieces of cornbread. Would have been nice for the waitress to tell me the soup came with cornbread so I didn't order the extra I didn't need. The soup was essentially partially coagulated fat with a few pieces of jalapeno added in. Since when do Philly Cheesesteaks have jalapenos???  I promptly regurgitated the slightly spicy gelatinous goo before even making it home. In fact, after about three spoonfuls, I almost redecorated the patio.   One person ordered the chicken nuggets and a basket of fries. The nuggets were over cooked and dry and the fries looked like they'd been sealed in a plastic container after frying making them wet and soggy.   Last meal we ordered was a sandwich that came piled with a stack of raw, cold jalapenos hidden under a layer of translucent cheese that looked like it had been melted three days ago.   Just don't do it. AVOID!",

    "text": "Extremely disappointed and unimpressed. My boyfriend and I were visiting our friends in Pittsburgh last weekend and we were really excited to try this place, due to their many options for herbivores. We ordered delivery and discovered the restaurant was out of the ingredients needed for our desired order...whatever, it happens. What really annoyed us was the quality of the food or lack thereof. The seitan \"wings\" were both tiny and so salty that we ended up just throwing them out. (Apparently, DWG equates \"Cajun\" with \"nauseating/dehydrating dose of Lawry's Seasoned Salt.\")  We also ordered the lentil Nekkid Burgers. These are, evidently, just a patty and a bun, hence their name. Unfortunately, no amount of condiments compensated for the simplicity of these pathetically dry, cold patties. These too, were thrown into the trash. Bottom line: I literally haven't written a review in years but severe disappointment prompts one to warn others.",

I got seitan wings and fries which were very good, however everything was a little too spicy for me. All of the wing sauces were spicy, even the bbq sauce and vegan tzatziki. I don't typically like even the slightest bit of spice, so it was hard for me to enjoy my meal. Other than that though, I came here for my birthday and it was a very nice time. I look forward to trying all of the other vegan options.",

Not only did I have to wait thirty minutes for my food to arrive, but when it did they were absolutely cold! Then when we did complain (note we didn't make it a big issue) the manager seemed to have an attitude towards the fact we wanted them heated or made brand new. She walked away during mid conversation and didn't even hear what else we had to say. Why am I paying for food I'm not even enjoying? When they finally gave us new food it wasn't even that hot and barely had any sauce. I asked for sauce on the side,and again didn't get that for another long time. The kicker is the BEST part, the remaining food I had after I barely ate they said they couldn't give me a box to go because \"it's against the rules\"! WHAT A FUCKING JOKE. Paying for something I can't even take with me. The server continued to avoid us the rest of the night not once did we have a refill or even have the question asked. Will not be recommending this restaurant to anyone.",

The amount of shrimp was decent for the price, but it was just beans, rice, and shrimp.  My dad ordered a burger that was also fine.  We then ordered 2 slices of cake.  A chocolate cake, that was supposed to be super chocolate-y, was flavorless.  The red velvet was slightly better, but at $6.95/slice, neither was worth it.  My dad ordered a beer that was ok, but overall, most of the food was something you could make at home.

    "text": "Attn. Dog owners:  I will start by saying that this place advertises as a dog friendly restaurant and at one part it is, but most definitely they are not friendly to a dog owners. Myself and my GF came in today with our medium size dog  for lunch. They have nice fenced in outside seating for customers with dogs. we took seat in the middle of the fenced in dining away from the rest of the guests. The server plopped our menus to a table that was close to the fence and let us know that he is not going to walk around and that we need to move or grab all our order from that table. We moved to that table. Our dog got a bowl of water and a server brought us small plastic cups of water and disappeared for 10 minutes without asking if we wanted anything else to drink. He then came back ready to take our order. we ordered our meal along with another drinks. ( also they did not have the  entry that was on the menu waiter never apologized and just rudely said: \"we don't have this today\") Our drinks also came in in a small plastic cups. my girlfriends cranberry juice had two ice cubs floating in which melted in a second. The drink was still warm. I then noticed that everyone else had tall glass cups and I called the server and requested some extra ice for the drink and asked why our service is different from others. I was told that this is a law and they can only serve us with plastic cups and paper plates. Our meal later came in Paper plates also. I enquired why it is this way and was told that if we dropped and brake our glass drinks the dogs would cut their paws.  The server left. then my girlfriend who ordered shrimps with vegetables looks at me and is like where is silverware. do we have to eat our food like dogs without spoon or fork? I waited for a bit while our food was getting cold and then  had to flag down another server and ask for forks and also catchup and napkins. No one ever apologized to us. They never replaced my girlfriends warm drink and only brought a jug full of ice. That was the most horrible dining experience that I had. I am not coming back and will make sure I share this review everywhere I can. Horrible and rude Stuff.",

    "text": "Dear lord why are you punishing me at food places lately?!  Do I not serve you well!?  Do I not praise everything and appreciate all the amazing food places you've sent me!?  Why God, why now are you punishing me with some of the worst meals I ever had the last few weeks!?  I had a choice, go to the tried and trusted P.F. Changs for dinner or open my mouth and say \"hey let's try somewhere we never been\"!  I just knew the Double Wide Grill would be awesome cause there's always people outside dining and it's been here awhile but I'm starting to think people just put up with crappy food cause they're afraid to say how they really feel for fear of everyone saying they're difficult or picky but I refuse to spend any dollar amount on crap food or keep my mouth shut about it because in the end, crap food wastes your time, your money, your patience, your enthusiasm and if it really sucks, makes for an awful bathroom experience.  This place has GRILL in the name so ya know, get a burger!  I was gonna get their brisket but the waitress informed me they were out of it.  Ok, burger it is.  ... .... ..... This cook had to be high or drunk cause only a high or drunk person would send this food out...  Before I even discuss this, Texas Toast is THICK cut bread right?  I mean any time I've ever ordered it or seen it, it's ALWAYS been big thick bread.  Well take a look at my bread in my picture, does that look like Texas toast or wonder bread, I say wonder bread.  Again I said NO PINK, not burnt black just no pink was my only request, same as my partners request.  They came out moo'ing of course.  BLACK on the outside and PINK on the inside.  Since when has making a burger with no pink but not burnt been such a hard thing to find!?    The fries felt like they came out of the trash bin, cold and grease smothered.  My \"Texas Toast\" bread was mush (see video) and the mashed potatos I ordered were cold and really just tasted like garlic and nothing else.  The Bloody Mary I ordered while I waited was a cup of horseradish and tasted like sink water.    The manager came out to try to remedy the issue and he gave us a $10 gift card and asked if we would come back which was nice but it still didn't counter balance his constant attempt at justifying why the food sucked.  Just say \"this looks like shit, this is a bad representation of us and when/if you come back I'll make right\", Don't go on and on about \"well I mean maybe cause, and well it is close to close and this is like this cause, and this and that\" just say it sucks and move on!  What is it with managers lately trying to sneakily blame the customer or make them seem like they lack an understanding of good food???  It pisses you off more than the food being bad!  Which brings me to my next point, I don't care if it's 5 minutes before close, a hour before close or first thing when you open up, the experience should be consistent across the board!  My waitress seemed cool, but she seemed just there to get a check, not sell me on what is awesome about the place.  She actually recommended places to go other than there!!!  Ya know, the first impression is everything, so when I go places I've never been I specifically say to our waitress/waiter \"I've never been here before, what do you suggest, I want to experience what this place is about\" (EVERY TIME it's a new place) and when they look at me like \"uhhhhhhhhhhh\" lol, um ok cool, let me figure this out!  Where's the training and ENTHUSIASM for where you work?    My partner did say she thought the cranberry cole slaw was good so I guess there is some silver lining to the story, even if it is still pink in the middle.",

In spite of how busy it was, she repeatedly made it a point to let us know that she hadn't forgotten us. She served our drinks and food in a timely fashion, but was so mindful of our presence, and apologetic for what she felt was a long wait. In addition to that, once things calmed down a bit, she was very personable and went the extra mile to engage us in conversation.  The rest of the staff was also extraordinarily friendly!  Huge selection of food for fair prices, and the Chardonnay was satisfying. Crisp, with a nice bite.  I got the nachos, which were abundant and contained loads of fresh toppings. My boyfriend got a burger, which he describes as \"no frills, straightforward, exactly what I expected\".  I would come here again, because the food was of sizeable portions and tasty, and because the service felt personalized and friendly!",

I suggest that you get with a mayo or some other sauce and tomato and lettuce however as it has a tendency to be a bit dry,especially if you plan on taking some home for leftovers. Another 4-5 star choice is the vegetarian chili. I immediately ordered it with sour cream and cheddar cheese and it was delicious (only because I have a very delicate stomach for spicy foods). My goal in life is to hunt down these recipes! The fries are delicious, I always ask for them to be done well done, it's a habit of mine every where I go, especially at Eat 'n Park (my pet peeve there) and they do not disappoint.",

Now, I get to sing your praises for your IMMENSE vegan/vegetarian food offerings.  First of all, the Double Wide has an enormous menu to begin with, and they offer two full pages of veg options. Every item is clearly marked whether it's vegan or vegetarian, and there is just SO MUCH. Most veg-friendly restaurants in the city offer a few options, but it's nothing like what Double Wide has got going on.  Second, the seitan wings. Oh god, yes. THESE are the best wings in the city and as close to the real thing as you can get. What sets their wings apart is the crispiness and the delicious sauces. My only very small complaint is I would love to see a vegan blue cheese or ranch dressing to accompany these delicious bundles. I've also had the seitan gyro twice, and it never disappoints.  Double Wide boasts a huge draft list, offers growlers and pints to go (it's called a meowler, how cute is that?), and still serves the best frozen drink in town. And they have a dog-friendly patio section, what more could you ask for?",

I can see this place being fun on a summer afternoon. I only focused on their vegetarian menu because I don't eat meat and I was absolutely lost for choice which NEVER happens..and at a bbq place too! I settled with the seitan wings and their new aloha burger with a pineapple salsa sauce which was excellent! The meatless stroganoff was ok.. tasty, just not what I was expecting. The portion sizes are large. I have to go back to try their cheeseburger and cheesesteak and veggyros!! OMG! Everything I wanted to eat but couldn't! Needless to say I'm going back. Also, it helps that they make super stiff cocktails (nothing fancy, think sweet and potent!) and politely put up with my requests of \"a little less this\" and \"can I add that\" to my cocktail gives them an extra star!",

The raspberry iced tea was tasty and there was a good variety of alcoholic beverages available.  I ordered the chicken, shroom & swiss and it was very good.  Two other options I was hoping for (salmon and turkey burger) were not available.  My wife got the brisket, which came with a dipping sauce that had a kick.  Without the sauce it was on the dryer side and was nothing spectacular.  We also ordered nachos with only cheese as an appetizer.  Some of the chips tasted burnt and the dish was rather dry, even with the cheese on top of it.  If we are in the area again, we would probably visit this place another time.",

It may have been the cooking oil as it had the odd aftertaste that comes with old oil.  I liked my pancakes as well. Although I wish the butter offered was real, or at least fresher.

    "text": "My husband and I, and our dog were eagerly looking forward to dining at the Double Wide.  We had read about the great food, and respected the owner's efforts to allow dogs on the patio.  However, on a recent Saturday afternoon, we were greatly disappointed, primarily, but not solely due to the poor service.  After finding a table, we sat waiting for approximately 20 minutes, until I decided to ask the hostess for assistance.    En route, a server asked me if I was seated in the corner; and beckoned me to the counter (we had read a review a while back, and recalled that the servers were not permitted on the \"dog\" patio, but didn't know what we were expected to do).   He told me to grab a menu, and walked away.  A while later, he stood at the counter, yelled over, and said that he had forgotten to explain the specifics, namely, we place our order at the counter, and get our own utensils, water, etc.---which was fine, had he done so when we got there, minus the rude demeanor.    As for the food, it was disappointing that only the brunch menu was availlable, but we managed to find a few items, which were just ok.  I'm guessing that dishes, glassware, etc. are not allowed because of the dogs, but food served on a paper plate without a side dish or even a garnish was very unappealing.  Our breakfast burrito was also cold, and for almost $10, should have come with something other than sauce.  Cocktails were also a joke.  I guess beer is the thing here, but we ordered mixed drinks and mimosas, which came in plastic cups barely larger than a dixie cup, and were definitely overpriced.  We are generally pretty easygoing, and don't tend to complain, but I have to agree with another reviewer that you feel like you have the plague in the dog area.  The waiter seemed put out that he had to deal with us, and at one point, another server ran in and grabbed some items left behind, and ran out, as though she might catch something.   The final straw occured while I was waiting to pay the bill; our waiter presented a couple of large dog bones to the customers' dog right next to me, but didn't offer our pup a thing...I guess she didn't rate either!!  Definitely won't be back.",

Excellent beer selection, with everything separated into helpful categories like \"Hoppy Beers\" and \"Stout Beers\".  Their fluffy corn bread side tastes like happiness.  So with so much to recommend it, why only 3 out of 5 stars?  Because this restaurant has everything going for it but the food.  My ribs and pulled pork were dry and tasteless.  The coleslaw, mashed potatoes and fries were bland.  Nothing was terrible, but it tasted like it had been left out under heat lamps in a cafeteria, definitely nothing worth going out of your way for.  That said, if you come here on a sunny day, order some drinks and a side of their corn bread (truly some of the best I've ever had) you will have a great time.  But with better alternatives so nearby, the Double Wide would not be my first choice for a meal.  For a more inspired dining experience, go a few blocks further down the south side and hit Fatheads.  Fatheads also offers a casual style, great beer selection, some outdoor seating and huge indulgent portions but with freshly prepared flavor explosions that will blow your mind!",

I called once and the hostess said that someone would call me back.  They didn't.  I attempted to call again and they just said they don't take reservations.  I think this is a mistake on their part.  If you have more than 20 people you essentially need one server dedicated to your table.  I don't think they can properly plan for the evening.    Moving on...I arrived early, 5:30 ish to drop off balloons and determine if they would be able to accomodate us.  The hostess looks me dead in the face and asked if I had a reservation or if I called ahead!!  WTF!!  Seriously!!  I looked at her and said did you jsut ask me what I think you asked me?  She repeated herself and I laughed.  I mentioned I tried to call several times and was told they don't take reservations.  LOL!!  I mentioned that we would be back in about an hour and that guests would start arriving around 7:30pm.  They kept trying to seat me inside but I kept mentioning that we chose to go to this restaurant because you could sit outside!    They truly have a great outside seating area and it is right on East Carson street!    They added some tables to an area and provided us with great service.  I honestly couldn't have been happier with our waiter, MIKE!!  Super nice guy with a great attitidee.  He was very accomodating.  He remembered what everyone was drinking even as we moved around our little area.  I can't say enough great things about the service we received from him.  I gave them 3 stars because they don't take reservations and make it difficult to accomodate large groups.  They also give you alot of hassle and don't seem to want to be real accomodating.",

A total shitshow when the kids come out for the drinking, but that's when it's time for this old lady to go home.",

And, they are especially tasty, not your run of the mill grilled veggies.  We tried the seitan wings, which were very good. Hubby had the grilled portobello reuben, which he thought was quite good. I had the grilled tofu with chimichurri sauce. Both were tasty options that we can't get elsewhere.  Very laid back atmosphere, probably great for groups, but also for those with children. We'll be back for the brunch.",

The beef chili was also delicious, with big chunks of peppers, onions and tomatoes.  Overall, I'd say this was one of the best places I ate at on my recent trip to the 'Burgh, and was a perfect way to cap off a night out with friends. I will be back.",

    "text": "Double Wide Grill was okay. I had a platter with brisket and a 1/3 rack of pork ribs. The ribs were good, but I thought the sauce was too sweet. The brisket was extremely dry, and the sauces served with it didn't really help.  The platter came with french fries, which were okay, cole slaw that was unremarkable, and corn bread that I didn't eat because I'm on a gluten-free diet.  I shared a serving of wings, which I also thought were too sweet.  So nothing really wowed me, and the brisket was not good.  Total bill was around $25.  There are about twenty beers on tap.  Each item on the menu is marked if it is wheat-free, vegetarian, or vegan, and there are many options of each type; also a separate gluten-free menu which lists all the wheat-free options.  This was very useful, and I was grateful for it.  If I lived in the neighborhood, I might eat at the Double Wide a few times a year.  But I'm not in Pittsburgh much, and the food at the Double Wide was not wonderful enough to make this a place I would go out of my way to visit whenever I'm in town, so I think I'm not likely to go back.",

I can't say anything about the food, but the menu looks great, and it's nice to see such a large vegetarian/vegan selection for those who prefer that type of cuisine. This review mainly concerns our waiter, Mike.  Mike was about as awesome as a party of 11 revelers could ask for. He took every drink order, remembered it properly,even though we moved around the table,  and never blinked an eye at us when someone ordered 11 shots for the table...more than once. He also went above and beyond when one of the bridesmaids had a \"wardrobe malfunction\" with the strap on her tank top and brought us a pair of pliers to help fix it.  Mike is the kind of employee any establishment would be proud to have!!  (and I'm totally coming back here to try some pulled pork or brisket!)",

We were seated immediately when we got there and our waiter was extremely nice. He was really on top of refilling drinks and even gave us a few beers to sample before we made our final choices.   The food is a little expensive for what it is and it didn't blow me away by any means. It was good, but this is not a place I would crave anything in particular and have to come back.   The food did come out pretty quickly and the service was great. They have a lot of vegetarian options too so it's good for groups with both meat eaters and non-meat eaters. Everyone will find something they will like on the menu.   It was a bit cold outside so we dined indoors, but it seems like this would be a really great place on a nice summer night.  Go for the consistently good service.",

    "text": "Double Wide used to be one of my go-to restaurants for the great mix of omni and vegetarian/vegan options, and fast and friendly service. I'm not sure what has changed over the last year, but my last several visits have been incredibly disappointing. Wait time for a table can be 30+ minutes though there are seemingly plenty of empty tables available. Orders have taken 30 - nearly 60 minutes to arrive even outside of peak hours. Despite the wait time, the food has often been cold and/or undercooked. Even when the restaurant is fairly empty, some servers rarely (if ever) return to the table to check to see if drink refills are needed, or anything else is required.  Recently, I visited with friends and their dog to utilize the designated dog seating/eating area. There are not a ton of restaurants in Pittsburgh to which you can bring your dog, most likely due to liability/health/safety concerns. In order to attempt to bypass these issues, the Double Wide dog area is entirely separate from the non-dog outdoor section, and virtually no wait service is provided. You must get up from your table and go across to the counter to order, pick up your food, and pay. Forget drink refills unless you want to serve yourself from a pitcher of warm water that has been sitting out for some time. You are served with paper plates and plastic utensils that you must bus yourself, and then spray and wipe the table down. Again, I get that having your dogs at a restaurant is a novel concept in this city, and that certain safety precautions must be in place, but it is just not worth the trip/cost just to eat with your dog here.  On a positive note, the food (when cooked properly) is consistently good, and the selection of vegetarian/vegan options rivals almost all other omni restaurants in the city.",

Like most nights it began with a single thought \"I want to get drunk.\" This thought usually turns into action and within an hour I have found myself a cozy watering hole. BUT, this night was different. Not only was I thirsty, I was also HUNGRY. Eating out isn't something I do often, I like to save what little money I have for libations.   I've always been intrigued by this place. It kinda has this late 50's service station look to it. Has some sweet lights and even some corn hole boards in the corner. Since I was the East Cayahoga state champ of cornhole back in '83 I figured it was reason enough to check out the place. Outside seating is a plus especially since the weather was actually nice.   The biggest plus was that I coordinated my visit with 35c wing night. I consider myself an amateur coniseour of wing and wing like foods (basically anything you fry) and let me tell you, these guys blew my socks off. They were fried perfectly with just the right amount of crispiness, they were pretty good size and the sauce was orgasm worthy.   So in conclusion roll on in to the double wide grill and let em lube ya up with the sauce and some frosty brews.",

    "text": "Double Wide on Carson St is probably the best outdoor eating establishment in Pittsburgh area. I know my way around Allegheny, Westmoreland, Butler and Beaver counties and choose to eat at DWG about once every 2 weeks.   The outdoor patio area is huge, easily tripling total seating capacity. On sunny, warm days the number of customers rises sharply which can lead to some extra wait time for seating and food. It can also lead to certain slow-cooked barbequed entree's selling out before the evening is over. Hey, I'm OK with that, it's totally understandable. The menu has broad coverage with lots of healthy & tasty options. I'd rate the portions and cost as average but quality is very good. I find it impressive that they can please both vegan and meat-eating customers. This makes DWG good for larger parties with picky eaters. For meat-eaters, the brisket, ribs, chicken, cajun fish and pulled pork is all really tasty. The vegetable side dishes are equally good with interesting combos you don't often see. I'm not into vegan entree's so I can't comment on that.  The bar is really nice and has a wide range of craft beers. We were so delighted to see former employee \"Lisa the bartender\" return to DWG. I'm betting the owners & mgmt are also thankful she's back. Lisa is super upbeat, interacts with patrons and serves to liven up the establishment.",

The veg dishes are mostly seitan, tofu, or vegetable/portabella based.  In the warmer months it is lovely to sit out on the patio to enjoy your meal and relax. The patio is very dog-friendly and many patrons bring their favorite pals along with them, leaving trails of \"oohs\" and \"aaws\" from other restaurant-goers. Service is typically quick, friendly, and knowledgeable of the menu-items. Double Wide is a good selection for a quick lunch or dinner for what you expect at a sit-down restaurant.   Drawbacks for the vegetarian items are that they seem to be out of stock of items on a somewhat regular basis.",

I'm also a big fan of their Saturday/Sunday brunch, during which you can find locals sipping on Mimosas and Bloody Marys. I usually order their tofu scramble wrap, which never disappoints.  Aside from its diverse menu, the Double Wide also has a really \"chill\" atmosphere. From its funky decor to its quirky staff, the restaurant definitely has a certain appeal.

It look like something you get in a bag.  Another note, the portion sizes are tiny.  Not just for that dish, but I've been with several other people for brunch and I look around at everyone's plates and there just isn't a lot of food there.

It's a great place to grab a cocktail with friends and enjoy the weather.  That's about all it's good for because to call this barbecue is a joke.  Again my southern roots don't fail me when it comes to traditional food.   Barbecue is supposed to be cooked for long periods of time on low heat to allow the flavor to set in whether it's vinegar, tomato, or mustard base the premise is still the same.    Here you can tell that the sauce is an after thought. The meat ends up really kind of dry with little to no flavor.  Service varies. The 1st time I went I had the most amazing server who was sweet and attentive without being over bearing and I loved her. Even though the food wasn't great I thought to myself at least the service is amazing.   The last couple of times I've gone (always with friends to just grab cocktails before we went out somewhere else) the service has been beyond lacking.  All in all, if you're looking for a cool spot to laugh it up with friends on your way somewhere better in the southside, Double Wide is your place. However if you're looking for tasty barbecue, try to find some place different.",

    "text": "Brunch starts at 10 AM on the weekends. I had cream cheese stuffed French toast. Wonderfully delicious and a great portion size. Served with hot syrup and potatoes. My husband had the Black and Bleu Burger that was seasoned with blackening spices and covered with melted Bleu cheese crumbles. Had I not been in a breakfast mood, I definitely would have tried one of their make-your-own TV dinners.  Not that it appealed to me, but they have a lot of vegan/vegetarian options here.   Minus one star for incorrect operating hours posted on their website... Unless I missed them. I will check again and update to 5 stars if I'm mistaken.",

    "text": "food was really good, even though one of our dinners came out barely warm. They made a new dinner. Menu choices were excellent, I got the TV dinner with brisket and tilapia, really excellent. Server was very friendly and nice, however really didn't see her much at all. Interestingly enough, seemed like a lot of the wait staff really didn't seem to be overly friendly, like walking around with smiles or anything similar. Probably took. At least 4 or 5 minutes just to flag someone down about the cold dinner. So food selection was excellent, however they could really use some work on customer focus, if that makes sense...Memphis BBQ (the thicker BBQ sauce) was freggin' FANTASTIC!",

    "text": "Family member brought me here a few days ago (friday night).  The place wasn't packed, and it was easy to find a table.  Good selection of beers, and the decor was rad (there's a CAR?!)  Place looks like an old garage, and the old advertisements are also awesome.    There's something called the Polar Bear Club, where if you consume all of your food/drink outside, your bill is half off.  Coming from San Diego, I have no idea why ANYONE would want to do that (esp. since there's plenty of room inside).  Needless to say the table and chairs were covered in snow, as if to say that they wouldn't be expecting anyone anytime soon.",
