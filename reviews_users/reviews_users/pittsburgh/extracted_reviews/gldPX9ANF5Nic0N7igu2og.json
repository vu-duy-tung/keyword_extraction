    "text": "The food was awesome, loved my tacos, queso, and guac! Unfortunately, the reason I am giving this review three stars is because of the service. I called ahead to see what time Condado was open until, assuming they may have early closing hours on a Sunday but they said they were open until 2 am. Our server had a bad attitude and rushed us the entire time. We wanted to stay and order more drinks but she cleared our table, which still had chips and a full bowl of queso on it. She then immediately gave us our checks after serving us another round. We wanted to continue drinking our drinks when she continued to look over to see if we paid. It was really uncomfortable and put us in bad moods before we went to a concert. Before leaving, I asked again if they closed earlier on Sundays and they indicated that \"they closed early upstairs if there were not many customers.\" There were probably 15+ people upstairs when we were there. We would have for sure sat downstairs if we knew this prior! Delicious food, but Pitt Condado employees need to have kinder and more patient attitudes.",

They helped us hide the cake and even served it when the time was right. This place gets extremely crowded during happy hour so people were bumping against us the whole time. The food was pretty decent. We got a couple of dips to sample and my favorite one was the corn. The tacos were good and I like the concept that you can build your own. The only thing that disappointed me was that they didn't have a non spicy steak taco. Definitely try the margaritas!! Salud!",

Pittsburgh is starting to fill in the Historic District and I can dig it.   Restaurant: It's small but hip. Wall art is postmodern Dia de los Muertos style. It's artsy and fun. They have both a custom taco option or you can opt into their already developed creations. The price point is kind of what threw me. It's located downtown but I like my taco's cheap. It's more artisan and edgy than I was looking for but I'm game for anything.   Food/Drink: I got 3 tacos that they designed. They were all completely different in flavor. The drink list is extensive and enjoyable.   Experience: I was here for lunch break and in a hurry. This place is not tailored to a quick lunch yet, but they are new and I'm sure they will get there. It's a great spot for a quick bite of adventure and a solid drink before you begin your evening adventures.",

We got there at 7:15 and were told there were four parties ahead of us, but they could not give us any estimated wait time. By 8 we checked in again to hear there were two parties ahead of us, but we did not actually sit down until 9pm. When we arrived we were told that they were out of all tortillas except for soft flour tortillas. While we understand this happens, this would have been nice to know when we arrived two hours prior. After telling the server we were upset, she brought the manager up who apologized for the food shortage and provided us with free dips (which was very nice and the only reason for the two stars in this review). When our tacos finally came out, the tortillas were cold and extremely soggy. My chorizo was also cold on the inside. Surprisingly, someone in my party received crunchy corn tortillas, so we aren't sure what happened there. Lastly, there were problems with our bill being split correctly. Our server was apologetic, but we still would not recommend going to dinner on a weekend here to anyone.",

We were sat upstairs only to find out that Happy Hour deals are only offered downstairs. Not a good start. We started with chips and the chorizo queso. This was the best part of the meal. The chips are house made and the queso had tons of chorizo! Delicious. That was about the end of delicious. We made our own tacos which is such a cool, fun idea. I got a brisket taco and a pulled pork taco. The soft shell came right out of a bag from a grocery store which was a little disappointing. The meats were both unseasoned and bland and the brisket was very dry. The sauces, salsa and toppings were very flavorful which saved the taco. The rice and beans (served in extremely small portioned cups) were also very bland and again the rice was bland.  This place has a lot of potential if they can improve the product they're serving to people. It's a great location and I love to see downtown Pittsburgh growing. The environment is also very hip and trendy. I'm hoping this was a single bad experience. I'll be back to try again.",

For starters, the staff is always super attentive and friendly even when it is super busy (which it usually is).  Each time I go I usually get a margarita. I do have to say they don't have the best margaritas, but their chips and queso make up for it.  I usually do a chip and dip trio which I get the spicy queso, salsa, and guac (per request of the group, I'm not really a guac fan).  The chips and queso are to die for.  I also get El Santo, one of their speciality tacos.  The menu has tacos already made up, or you can make your own.  I can't lie, I love El Santo so much that it's what I normally order, so I can't speak to the other items.  BUT, anything the rest of my group orders they absolutely love.    The prices are very reasonable and the atmosphere is very fun ! I will keep coming back for more, for sure !",

We were seated almost immediately, which I thought was great considering the estimated wait time online of 30 minutes. We were however seated at a small table sort of in the middle of all of the foot traffic, with people constantly hitting our chairs as they walked by. But, beggars can't be choosers.  Anyway, the menu looked great. We were politely greeted by our waitress who explained the menu to us. We selected to build our own tacos, filling out a paper menu with the type of taco, toppings, sauces etc. Cool idea, similar to some build your own burger restaurants in the are.  Unfortunately the drink I ordered, a \"Mexican Coke\" in a bottle was never delivered. I decided I probably didn't need it anyway, and didn't want to bother the waitress who I could tell was already stressed by having too many tables to wait on. Our food was finally delivered. Tacos in cardboard boats wrapped in foil. Presentation looked ok at first, however as you unwrapped the tacos, half of the ingredients were already all over the sides of the shell. Understandably, tacos are not a clean eating food, but there was very little attempt to even keep the toppings/sauce inside the shell in the first place. First bite...a lot of sauce- some cilantro lime cream sauce. Good, but slightly overpowering for the flavor of the taco. The meat....unfortunately I can say that the chicken tasted like it was directly out of a can, and not really much else added to it. I guess the sauce is supposed to cover that. Salty food requires water, which was quite hard to come by. After asking our waitress for a refill..two or three other table who were just seated and received their drinks before a plastic pitcher was brought to the table. The lid apparently was not very great, causing the waitress to pound it into place-table side- splashing me in the eye with water. Not really an issue, just more of a lack of attention and poor equipment. Finally we decided to just ask for the check, of which unfortunately contained the Mexican Coke which I never received. Asked for a to go box for the tacos, received two extra pieces of foil and a brown bag...I guess that's a good way to do it? But the foil was no where big enough to cover the taco that was already leaking. Paid the bill and left. While walking out, felt that unforgiving rumble in my stomach. A 20 minute drive proved quite challenging, finally making it home with regret and a prolonged stay on the toilet. Quite unfortunate, it looked like a great place...maybe it can be. But I will probably not be going back to this place, and I forewarn those who are looking for a good taco and a healthy GI System...look elsewhere.",

The only complaint is that the menu is a bit confusing when building your own tacos (if you are getting more than two and being very specific about what you want on each).",

The restaurant has build your own taco concept which sounds fun but the food was not good at all. I didn't even end up eating the tacos. There is almost no meat in them and the meat that is included does not taste good. I had the brisket and pork and you could tell which was which and both had a sweet sauce on them which was not tasty.  I also ordered a jalapeno margarita which I also couldn't drink because there was so much sour mixer in it.  I have to say I will not be going back.",

However I find myself eating inside the restaurant less and less because of the horrendous service I have received time and time again. I go about three times a week to enjoy some of their delicious tacos. They have a wide range of tacos and can even create your own taco. They also have a wide assortment of guacamole, salsa, and queso. They have a full bar as well with every type of tequila you can imagine. I am not writing this review to bash on this place because they do have great food and I will continue to get there food, only through take out with the occasional meal at the bar with their male bartenders, who are the only ones that provide exceptional service. They have one male bartender in particular, named Dave, that I will come see time and time again because he is not only great as his job but extremely friendly and goes above and beyond. Overall, it is a place to try and when eating inside the restaurant try to sit at the bar when Dave is there.",

RIP tonic (will miss u).  -The music was oddly loud for lunch at noon on a Thursday. I felt like I was in da club.  -Tacos are generously sized compared to the two-bite Bakersfield tacos down the street; I built two brisket tacos which were pretty num.  -Queso + chips were good. A Generous amount of dip and waiter gave us extra chips.  -Margaritas are good. They use real fruit/lime juice.  -The menus are a bit confusing at first!  -All in all: 4 stars for above average food/drinks at super reasonable prices but docked a star bc nothing really stood out as OMGZ",

    "text": "I have been here twice so far and have loved the food I ordered both times.  Got there before 4:30 (on a Friday) the first time I went, downstairs was already pretty full so my friend and I went upstairs and sat at the bar. The one big negative from this visit was the bartender did not tell us that happy hour was downstairs only and we found out when we over heard her telling others later. In general people were unhappy to hear that. I heard several complaints from others once they found out. It doesn't make much sense to me either but I know nothing about the restaurant business. Other than that the food was good and came out quickly.   Second time I went was a Saturday afternoon, the downstairs was pretty full again so we went upstairs not expecting happy hour prices. Three of us split the El Tres Amigos and ordered build your own tacos. The issues with this trip was first with the Dirty Queso we ordered. On the menu it says 'chicken, black beans, onions, dirty sauce' when we received it it was just plain queso with a little of the dirty sauce drizzled on top.. Kind of annoying, if your out of it just tell us, don't try to fake it. It was still damn delicious but we wanted to try something different. My friend ordered one drink and a different server brought her a different drink and said something like 'well just give it a try' and walked away. Our server came over and apologized for the mix up and said if she wanted the correct drink it's not a problem. Not a huge biggie at all, probably wouldn't even have mentioned it but it was the weird way the first girl handled it that made all of us say 'wtf'. Once we received the rest of our food we were happy campers. Two of my friends were going to order more drinks but we hadn't seen our server in some time so by the time she did come over we decided to go elsewhere for further drinking.  Food is wonderful, service could use some work but it's still new. I will probably stick to Sienna and Bakersfield for drinks though! (note: I was going to give this 3 stars for the service and other mix ups but I just really liked the food and food prices!)",

We ordered the Anejo Manhattans and the cranberry guac to start.  The Manhattans were ok, they came on the rocks which isn't my favorite way to drink a Manhattan and they were a little too sweet.  The guac was ok and reminded me of the store bought kind, though the toppings dressed it up.  There was an option for  build your own taco, but we opted for the already put together kind.  I got a surf and turf, but didn't really see any steak.  I also got the taco with the jackfruit and double taco shell held together with queso.  That one was pretty good.  I feel like if they focused on making a few things really good, rather than having such extensive options, it could be better.  I would say that if we were in the area, we might stop for an appetizer and drink, but wouldn't make it a destination.",

If I was given one last meal - it would be Tacos - and it would be Condado's brisket tacos with the many unique and delicious toppings and sauces they offer. I am salivating right now just thinking about them.  I got hooked on this place after first being introduced to their Margaritas from a girlfriend of mine (BLOOD ORANGE IS TO DIE FOR) and their chips and dip (which is one of my favorite foods).  Eventually we tried their tacos and I can't believe it's taken so long for me to have them.  They're one of a kind with a wide variety of assorted toppings, sauces, and styles of taco shell.  They're a decent price, seem to be going more expensive since they've first started but you really do get a lot in one taco.  I'm typically full off of 1 and my fiance can't finish more than 2-3.  I can't say enough good things about this place.  Only downside is that it does get quite busy and seating is very congested, I'm talking about rubbing elbows with whomever is seated next to you, hearing everyones conversation.  The upstairs is a bit more open, however that area is not always open.  With that being said I have had a few to go orders messed up and unfortunately you don't find out until you're home unwrapping the tacos and about to dive in.  I've worked in the service industry so I understand from time to time things like that will happen.  Love this place, haven't been able to find better tacos.",

I respect it.   Versatile gringo style tacos (and some non gringo)! Have the option of selecting from their recommended tacos or creating your own. With a piece of paper and a pencil and a few X's (sorry didn't mean to sound like a divorce lawyer ad) you can construct your own tacos.  Nachos and other typical dishes are available too. The nachos do look heavenly, won't lie. It's one of the few places where you can \"double decker\" up with a tortilla and crispy shell.   The meats are cooked well and the margaritas are strong AF yet extremely delicious. We got mango jalapeno and that hit the spot (by spot  I'm pretty sure it was a stomach ulcer but worth it )  Overall, dope little taco haunt at the location formerly known as \"tonic\" and a great addition to downtown.

I tried to join their rewards program and no one wanted to help me do this. When I first moved here, I enjoyed this place and went a handful of times because of its convenient location and cool vibe. After the last couple experiences, I will be avoiding this place. Also, their chicken tacos are TERRIBLE! Get those only if you like totally bland, boiled chicken! It's really easy to mask the lack of flavor with sauces and toppings, but a True foodie and cook will know the difference. If you want good tacos, I'd suggest venturing outside the city into Coraopolis for La Poblanita! It's super authentic and well seasoned, well cooked, and delicious! Fair warning though, that place won't have your fancy sauces and there is no seating except for some benches outside.",

The Spanish was especially heinous--a light-up sign proclaimed \"Tacos Delicioso\" (should be \"deliciosos\"); a menu item was called \"el Tres Amigos\" (should be \"los\") and worst of all, the spicy tacos were labelled \"mucho caliente\", which means, \"a lot of hot\", not \"very spicy\", which in Spanish is \"muy picante\".

    "text": "Condado has great happy hour deals (except for when an event is in town). First, drinks. The pomegranate marg is my personal favorite, but all of the flavors are great! The flight of margaritas is the best way to try multiple flavors if you can't pick just one. Second, apps. I'm a sucker for queso and Condado has some of the best. Always out quick and nice and warm. Can't beat it. Third, tacos. With a sheet of paper to customize your tacos however you want, this place really has it all! (The sweet Lucy taco is to die for!!)",

Walked in and I immediately got a seat at the bar; the place was packed but as a single person I didn't have any issues finding a seat. The menu is quite complicated but once I got the hang of it (the bartender was very helpful explaining it to me) I had a blast. Their chorizo is amazing, and their tacos are sooo good. I enjoyed their cocktails and I made happy hour so it was cheap. I had a very fulfilling meal including alcohol for less than 25 bucks, which is a miracle.   The food was so good I came back the following day with friends.",

They have a ton of different flavors and I swear each one is more delicious than the next! I haven't tried a flavor I didn't like.  The tacos are customize-able which is fun, but always makes me nervous I'll make a terrible combination.  Luckily they have some pre-made selections if you need suggestions.    I highly recommend the \"Sweet Lucy\" shell which is a hard shell, queso, guac, and a flour tortilla.  The queso appetizer is pretty addicting too!   This past visit one of the food runners ended up with extra chips and salsa and gave it to us for free which was so nice! I would definitely order the queso or guac over the salsa, but it was great to try it! I would not recommend the chorizo in your taco unless you like things realllly spicy.  It was the only thing I would change about an otherwise great dinner at Condado.",

    "text": "Did you know that Condado offers 335,544,320 different combinations of tacos? So far, every one that I have tried has been quite good! I highly recommend the beef brisket and the juju shell, which is the combination of a soft and hard shell with queso and chorizo in between. The option of customizable tacos is also great if you are going out with a picky eater.  Happy hour is from 5-7 pm Monday through Friday and includes half off margaritas and $1.00 off tacos and drafts. You cannot take advantage of the happy hour deals on the upper floors so sometimes there can be a bit of a wait. There are no reservations and the staff will ask for a phone number when putting your name in so that they can contact you when a table is ready. You have five minutes to claim your table after it is ready.  The inside of Condado is cute and eclectic with different paintings adorning the walls. It can get pretty loud in there, especially during happy hour. However, the food comes out quickly and is delicious. Make sure to ask for their monthly specials!  In my opinion, Condado has much better tacos than Bakersfield even if their queso is not as good. While the queso at Bakersfield is on another level, Condado has more options. I definitely think that Condado is a good place to try out!",

The only downside was the music. It was the most god awful pop Brittany spears bullshit.  Looking around, it didn't fit any of the crowd.

I didn't mind waiting, but there really was no place to wait (and the weather outside was terrible!).   We were seated super close to the tables surrounding us, but I didn't mind because I was so excited for tacos. The restaurant was really loud, so if you're looking for a place to catch up and make lots of small talk, perhaps this isn't the joint for you.   We started with the queso, guacamole, and salsa. The portions were huge and the chips were fresh and bottomless. The create your own tacos were unique. We had a lot of fun deciding what toppings to get. I thought my chicken taco was better than the brisket. I found the brisket to be pretty dry.  Also had a blood orange margarita and would highly recommend that!   Overall, I was impressed with the menu and the prices. I will definitely return!",

    "text": "I went here twice in the span of 24hrs for dinner and brunch; If you want the best damn tacos in Pittsburgh, these are the best damn tacos in Pittsburgh.   I'm a big fan of Doce Taqueria, Tako, Bakersfield, El Burro and even Las Palmas but Condado Tacos is THE best in Pittsburgh and here is why.  (You can skip to the last paragraph if you not like read long) 1. THE Tacos Starting with the queso or guac is a must here. Ooey-gooey melty goodness that is just ooh wow hot wow delicious. The diablo queso isn't as spicy as you'd imagine and the Tuscan guac is pretty fantastic.Chips and corn shells are fresh and are bomb dot com. The ability to build your own tacos gives you the ability to royally \"F\" your own taco, but it also gives you the ability to make an incredibly tasty masterpiece. Brunch, Lunch or Dinner, their Chorizo is really, really (I mean REALLY REALLY) good. Their pulled pork doesn't beat Doce but their brisket, steak, ceviche, chicken, and portobellos are all expertly seasoned and absolutely delicious and mouth-wateringly tasty (the steak and ports with eggs for breakfast is just ughhhmazing.) Sauces- GREAT, salsas- just meh, but fresh.  2.The Drinks This is a bar that sells tacos.Good beer selection(taps and cans), a plethora of tequila and a bunch of cocktails that are pretty darn good (although they can be pretty strong...which is a bonus in my book). Also, Micheladas. Year round. Love me a michelada. These guys aren't the cocktail kings, but they have good stuff and great prices, especially during happy hour.  3.Everything else This bar pulls out the stops. Great location with enough seating so you don't have to wait forever; Enough room at the bar for those who want to drink the night away and the atmosphere(super cool vibes) that encourages it, if you wanted. Coat/purse hooks under tables and at the bar; A convenient touch for comfort. Kitchen is open till one 7 days a week so you can grab your midnight snack, drunk or not, any night of the week. A rewards program that makes you want to go back over and over and a Happy Hour that really makes that easy. Lastly, but not leastly, the service is good and with time will be great. Patrick was there day and night and went out of the way to make sure we understood everything, as well as making sure we were topped off and satisfied.   ALL IN ALL, the prices here align with your typical taqueria ($3 tacos +$ for anything special) yet taste like your upscale fancy pants taco (I'm talking about Tako and Bakersfield). They don't charge you or focus on presentation and location and that alone is commendable. Drinks are great and they are appropriately styled and priced. Service is still growing its roots and confidence but is still good.   I'll be a regular here. A Condadoer. A condadooy. Condaddy? Whatever, I'll be there weekly.  (Condaddy for sure) lol.",

Granted, they've tested this already in their successful counterpart in Columbus, but dang, these are some good tacos!  The concept is build your own tacos. So you fill out a form for exactly what you want your taco to be. Flour or corn tortilla? Double stacked with gauc inside?? Dorito taco... Okay I made that last one up, but seriously the options are endless with meats, cheeses, toppings and sauces. The works! So it's really your fault if you make a bad taco! Although I would be hard pressed to find one I didn't like. I built one with their house made chorizo and fresco sauce and it was incredible. The other steak one I built was pilled high with chipotle cheese. Just thinking about them makes my mouth water.   We also got chips, which are freshly baked and fried in house with two types of salsa (house and verde) and the queso with beans. The only miss was that the queso was really runny, so it made picking up the sauce with chips hard. But it still tasted good somehow, just messy!  The service was top notch and I love the vibe. Can't wait to make this my go to happy hour and taco spot... I feel like this is just the beginning of a beautiful relationship make in taco heaven!",

BUT I have never in my life experienced service as bad as I had at this restaurant.  Awhile back, a group of friends and I had reservations for a special occasion. Out of 11 of us, only one member of our group had been to Condado. When the waitress greeted us at our table, she asked if any of us had been there before and the one member raised their hand. The waitress said \"Okay, well if you've been here then you can explain how this works and make my life easier\" and then left for 20 minutes. There were a bunch of other issues throughout the evening (including her taking a glass of water that one person had been drinking out of and giving it to another person instead of just getting them a new glass). Finally, the week after, I checked my bank statement to see that they had overcharged me as well as several other members of our group. What was supposed to be a nice \"pick-me-up\" for a friend ended up being so disappointing.",

I got two recommended tacos and one I made myself. I got the El Tradicional and wasn't a fan at all. Didn't even finish it after one bite. Also got the Ooey Gooey and that was good but pretty spicy. I'd go again for happy hour and fill up on drinks, chips and make my own tacos from now on",

Every visit is 5/5 stars for food and drinks! 4/5 stars for staff... only because they get very busy and you have to wait awhile at times to get fresh drinks. This review is only 4/5 stars, because we visited last night pretty late and were told the kitchen was still open but was closing soon. So we put in our taco orders and the food was served quiet quickly. However, everyone's tacos were cold... be advised you will not get freshly cooked food if you order close to kitchen closing.",

Even on busier nights, they make sure that you are taken care of to the best of their ability. Our server Michael provided exemplary service tonight under the management of Audrey. And I haven't even gotten to the food yet-- the tacos are fantastic. The order sheet has options for creative twists if you're feeling a little adventurous alongside more classic styles. I would definitely recommend their happy hour after a long shift at work!",

The inside is super hip with skull graffiti on the walls and cool people working there.  This was a pre opening day, so they were working some kinks (i.e. app came before our pitcher of margaritas) out but that did not take away from the great food and service. Many managers checked on us throughout our meal to make sure that we had a memorable experience.   Some things to Note: The margaritas are tasty.  Not that sugar mix garbage that you get at other places.  This pitcher tasted like it was handcrafted with just enough sours and more than enough alcohol,  A plus for authenticity.  The tacos are tasty.  Interesting flavors, spicy, not spicy.  Anything that you want, you can get. there are no menus there.  More than the flavor, these bad boys are filling.  After eating an endless bowl of chips, two tacos was almost too much NO MENUS (sort of):  You have a tablet of pre-made tacos and a tablet of make your own.  There are a lot - ALOT of options.  It isn't blatantly stated, but you can add proteins to pre-designed tacos.  I have a \"Trust the chef\" mentality, so I usually stay away from anything build-your-own, butI did create a shrimp Seviche taco that really hit the spot.",

We were expecting a long wait for a table and then for food after we ordered. There were about 6 tables ahead of us and we only waited about 15 minutes. After we ordered everything came out quickly and was hot. Since it's the grand opening there were lots of specials on margaritas and your first Taco was free. I got a peach Margarita and my husband got prickly pear. Prickly pear kind of tastes like watermelon. They were both good. I was surprised that I liked their traditional Margarita more. My husband says that is has a punk-rock rock Taco vibe to it and I have to agree.   I really love the build your own taco option. It's like Mad Libs only you end up with a delicious yummy dinner. We got the dirty dip and it was absolutely delicious. I queso dip with chicken beans onions, \"dirty sauce\" and a whole bunch of yum.  I called this the flavors of Tako and the value of Los Palmas. I wouldn't bring your grandmother cuz it's kind of loud but works in this place.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "When I heard we were getting a new taco place in downtown I was beyond thrilled. Who doesn't love tacos? I know I think about tacos almost all day every day. A group of friends and I stopped here one Saturday after the Winefest to give it a try. I think it was safe to say the entire group loved it.  The decor of this place is spot on and I absolutely loved it. The drink menu was very extensive and had a lot of mexican drinks that you don't see all that often. Ever since I had a michelada on vacation years ago I have had trouble finding places that served them. They also have a variety of margarita flavors that you won't find most places. Sure other places have your strawberry or raspberry but Condada has banana, prickly pear, peach, jalapeno, and the list goes on. Our waitress recommended a mix of strawberry and jalapeno which I will definitely be trying next time!  Most importantly though, and the main reason I gave it a 5 star, is the tacos. Don't get me wrong it is hard for me to not like a taco. What I like most about this place is the fact that you can create your own tacos. I don't mean just pick your meat, toppings, and shell. You can choose from a corn tortilla, to a flour, to a hard shell within a flour with cheese in the middle. They have multiple meets, sauces, cremes, etc. For those that don't want to create their own they also have suggested tacos that you can order. Most of which looked delicious but as a first timer I obviously had to create me own.   All in all, I think Condado Tacos is definitely worth checking out and I would highly recommend it. And when you do go get yourself some chorizo queso! It's amazing.",

It goes 5-7pm M-F which is later than most places and is essentially half price margs and tacos. Each taco is fairly large so you really only need to order 2 or 3 for a meal at most. When I went, I also got the chips and corn guac (forget the exact name) - it was so tasty!! I was surprised at the intense flavors of everything I had here. Much better than a lot of other restaurants downtown that have tacos, in my opinion. I want to come here all the time now.  Must, must, must try!",

I didn't want to pay extra for rice however the greens, cilantro and tomatoes are free to add so it was the best to add to tacos.

    "text": "Do not do it. Please, don't!!! Hand to *whoever you pray, or don't,* this is the worst place I've ever eaten on the promise it would be suitable. I had a Lyft driver and bartender try to sell this place as a good spot for late night eats, and I'm struggling to paint the picture without being overly verbose but that's the only way I can, I'm sorry.   Walked in late night, stoked for some good eats. Warning sign numero uno: two people next to me had food they were eating and it smelled awful. I chalked it up to maybe having ordered something weird? I ordered a beer..it was satisfactory. It was okay, is okay good with you?   I picked two tacos through the choose your own adventure menu. Maybe I ordered wrong? I hope not! The fundamentals (tortillas, meat, etc.) weren't good. Also, if you give people the ability to pick options to build their own taco, don't give them the option to fail!   I've never left a taco plate or a a serving of beans uneaten but I couldn't finish my food. Here's why:   The flour tortilla on my mushroom taco was cold and grainy, the mushroom had zero flavor, and the parts of the tortilla that weren't ice cold were gummy which tells me it was microwaved or something there means it wasn't heated on a flattop or pan. Also, the ground beef taco was DISGUSTING. Do you like Taco Bell? Sure, we all do. Imagine Taco Bell texture and quality without the taste. THIS PLACE!!! Zero flavor with TB quality. Sick.   Do I need to talk about the beans??? Beans are 995% my jam!!! I took 3 bites. The first was to have a bite and the next two were to determine what I was tasting - burnt chiles. It tasted like char and gas. It was awful!   What concerns me most - this is apparently a chain? I hope this place is an anomaly or that my experience was an anomaly. This isn't just the worst Mexican food or worst tacos I've ever eaten, this goes down in the books as one of my worst restaurant meals, period.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FDo.not.do.it&s=48c7c21e110e40f88ab1d2d00f9c7738b6aadec8afc1995da8edc0c3eebbcd6c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Do.not.do.it</a>.",

Drinks: Extensive drink menu with so many margarita flavors. I had the blood orange and will have it again in the future! My friends had Blackberry and pomegranate, which were also very good. They even offer margarita flights to sample some of the flavors.   Food: We had the usual chips and queso to start. Nothing special, but how can you not? Then we ordered tacos. They have a preset menu or you can build your own. I did a build-your-own with chorizo. Very good! I had the pulled chicken before and was not as impressed. The tacos are a generous size. Order two for a complete meal. The build-you-own menu offers a number of salsas/tortillas/meats/toppings - you can't go wrong!   Space: Condado has two floors. We sat downstairs. Seating is tight!

The place was packed on a Tuesday afternoon, so obviously it is a popular after work spot.  We started with a chips and a bunch of different salsas.  Guacamole, Sweet Corn, Queso.  All were amazing.  I think you can make the Chips and Salsa a meal if you really wanted to and not be ashamed about it.  But you really don't want to do that.  The Tacos are amazing! So many options! Build your own or chose one of the already created tacos from the menu.  You can create your own taco from a long list of options of shells, cheeses, meats and other toppings. They have pads on the tables with all the options and you fill it out with what you want and rip off the slip to hand to the waiter/waitress. Its that easy to do, but trying to construct your own tacos given all of the options can be a daunting task.  I had two tacos with Chorizo and two with Shrimp Ceviche. I only slightly varied the topping between the two, but both kinds were very good and filling.  The Hard shell inside the Soft Shell was great and kept everything together and from getting messy.  My wife wants to go there after telling her of my experience, so I hope to be back soon!",

    "text": "After graduating from college in the Pittsburgh area, I think Condado Tacos is the place I'm gonna miss the most. It truly is a taco eatery in a league of its own. First off, I LOVE that condado has solid vegetarian protein options, rather than most taco places which just have a singular options. Here, you can choose from Thai chili tofu, pulled jackfruit, mushrooms, or even rice and beens. My personal favorite is the tofu, which is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Next, you can choose from pre made tacos or build your own. Normally, I build my own so that I can put all the toppings and sauces that my heart desires. Another unique aspect is that condado has double shell tacos, with one soft and one hard, plus other fillings like quest and gauc, without costing extra! Normally, I can get two very filling tacos for under $10 here.   At happy hour, there are margherita deals and $1 off tacos. Another cool thing that condado offers is the option to mix two flavors in your margherita, like strawberry-mango, etc.   Honestly, I could go on and on raving about this place but you should go check it out for yourself :)",

    "text": "This restaurant brings a different vibe to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene. As soon as you walk in, the dim lights but colorful wall decor bring a setting that I personally have never seen in Pittsburgh. A fun fast casual place. It's got two floors - small seating downstairs with a lot more room upstairs. There's a bar on both levels. I've never had to wait longer than 15 minutes for a table at this one (I've had long waits at the Lawrenceville location, however). A really great place for a big group of friends to go!  Starting with drinks and apps, the house margarita and the white sangria are amazing! The guac is great and I've honestly gone to Condado sometimes just for their chorizo queso - it's the best. Very sweet and rich. Then, when it comes time to order tacos, they have a couple recommended orders but they have a \"build it yourself\" menu. You can order as many tacos as you want with whatever you want. Every type of meat you want and all your classic taco toppings - vegetarian options too! Every taco starts at $3.50 and most toppings are free (some toppings add $1). Individually, things are pretty cheap, but add up pretty quick when you get carried away with the amazing menu.  I've never had bad service. If the place is busy (which it tends to be) servers can be a little slow on drink and chip refills, but they're always nice and food comes out really quick.  I will always suggest Condado first when it comes to choosing dinner or late night food places with friends. If you haven't gone, you definitely have to!",

    "text": "I write this review as I walk towards Condados Tacos for the fourth time in the past week of arriving to the Pittsburgh area (yes, you read that right), so that must tell you something off the bat.  This is a small taco joint located in the heart of downtown Pittsburgh, with a small interior but tacos that surely make up for it. The way you order is quite original: you take a list check boxes and a pencil from the table and either check which (and how many) tacos you would like. They have two lists - one for their 'signature' tacos, and one for those who would like to make their own.  Service is fast, those who work there are certainly instrumental to their business's success.  They also seem to have a wide selection at their bar, although I have not personally tried any of their drinks.  And, most importantly, the tacos...the freaking tacos man...they are miraculous. Pretty much every other food item on the list I have tried (guac, chips, rice) is just downright orgasmic.   So in short, definitely check this taco joint out. You won't be dissatisfied.",

I love being able to build my own taco since I'm such a picky eater (get the roast pollo it's amazing!). And the margaritas are strong and so yummy, love all the different flavors. It's always crowded for happy hour so be early!",

    "text": "Bar service review only: 2 stars only because their margs and food ARE delish, 0 stars for service. I wish I knew the name of the horrid bartender I had while sitting at the bar recently (see check \"server: downstairs b) so that management could appropriately follow up. Beyond the initial greet in which she barely grunted at me, she did not use words or speak to me the ENTIRE meal I had. I attempted to ask for a fork multiple times in which she blatantly ignored me (ended up asking a server on the floor). Further, my margarita sat completely empty pushed to the bar front for 25+ minutes. I would have enjoyed another but she was too busy on her phone and I wasn't ABOUT to yell across the bar at her for another drink after her barely addressing me.   The thing, however, that set me over the edge and forced me to write this was that in her ignoring me the whole time - she couldn't even give my credit card back to the correct person. After waiting for my check for another 10 minutes, she ran my card and set it down in front of another guest down the bar. The bar was NOT that busy that this should have happened and its unacceptable with all the identity stealing that happens in today's world.   I think she and management need to rethink her role as a bartender if this the type of service you receive from \"downstairs b\". Part of being a bartender is being welcoming and helpful and she was ANYTHING but that. Sorry Condado but the tacos ARENT THAT good and Bakersfield is right down the street where at least I know I will get a \"hello\", a \"thank you\", and my credit card back to the right person at their bar.",

El tres amigos allows you to choose 3 different dips to sample with a monthly queso and guac that always exceed expectations--we love the Tuscan guac!

Server finally agreed that the meat is not supposed to be cold, and took it back to ask the kitchen remake it.   I didn't really have much of an appetite after the remake came out... the tacos were all drenched in sauce and the shells were moist and sticky. I just gave up after that.

    "text": "My GF and I were looking for a nearby dinner option after a play downtown on Saturday afternoon. We love tacos, so of course were stoked to see a taco place at the end of the block. We perused their menu in advance and were impressed.   The quick summary: Food            4.5 - Great menu and delicious!  Atmosphere 1.0 - Downright awful Service         2.5 - Solidly mediocre  Total             2.6 - Disappointing mixed bag.  *The Food* They have two primary options for tacos--a list of their suggestions or build your own. There are GREAT vegetarian options. Overwhelmed by the prospect of figuring out the right combination of mouth-watering items, I went with one each of their suggested vegetarian options: The Mantis (pulled BBQ Jackfruit) and the Dutch Dragon (portabellos). I also ordered sides of beans and rice.   We ordered chips and queso blanco to start. The chips appear to be house-made and the queso was tasty.   Both my tacos were great. Nice combinations of flavors and spices. They were of a decent size so two made a good meal. I did note that they did not have any soft corn tortillas, which was disappointing since a good homemade corn tortilla is a key component of a good taco. Even if they don't have the capacity to make their own, they're probably not a mile from La Reyna...just sayin'.  *The Service and Atmosphere* To be clear, I do not expect servers to be my best friend and I appreciate that it is not an easy job. That said, I expect competence, which requires the restaurant to ensure proper training and the server to put it to use. I note a few other reviews that point to lousy service as well, so it would seem that our experience was not unique and the FOH training is lacking.   The waitress asked if we'd been there before and when we said we hadn't, she did little more than point us to the papers on the table with pretty self-explanatory directions. She didn't know what horchata was or how to pronounce Jarrito's. My sides did not come out with my food (the waitress did not deliver the food). It took her a few minutes to come check in after the food was delivered and took a while more for the beans and rice to arrive after I asked for them. When they arrived, they were in the little plastic cups in which you'd get salsa to go, so I'd guess maybe  cup of each--at least they don't charge that much for them. My tacos were in a plastic basket with wax paper liner, so I had no way to eat the beans and rice (with my plastic spork) without making a big mess (the tiny plastic cups were filled to the top) and certainly no way to mix them together as I intended. A plate would have been a nice option, but the waitress dropped them on the table from over my shoulder, so I wasn't looking at her when she did and left, so by the time I processed what was in front of me, there was no opportunity to ask for one. I took them to go and had them the next morning with eggs--they were delicious.  The atmosphere in this place is AWFUL. The overall vibe is 20-something sports bar. It is SO OPPRESSIVELY LOUD, it feels like the noise is physically pushing you down. The free noise meter app on my phone read levels between 50-70 decibels. Everything in the restaurant is hard-tables, chairs, floor, brick walls, exposed ceilings--the whole industrial acoustic horror show plus loud music. The fact that the Pens were playing that night and there was a Pitt game didn't help things. There were large tables of young people ordering pitchers of pink alcohol and shots of tequila in mason jars and using the kind of voices generally associated with such things. Conversation was nearly impossible across the three feet of table between me and my girlfriend and obviously this does not help the servers do their job because they cannot hear you well.  Overall, it was a very disappointing experience. I'd definitely eat their food again, but only if I don't have to go into the restaurant.",

If you're only getting tacos I think two or three are fine, based on how hungry you are. They're pretty big and filling.  Nachos were nothing special. We had quite a lot left over but didn't box. We mostly just ate the free chips that they gave us, which were good. The tacos were also fine, but again nothing special. It kind of felt like they were going for the authentic but hip vibe with some of their ingredients, and it just didn't end up impressing me. None of the individual ingredients (and I tried to get a variety) were amazing. Just didn't live up to other tacos I've had, growing up in California.  All that being said, I see the appeal for make your own tacos and nice drinks in a hip environment at a reasonable price point. Also the murals, art, and service were all awesome!",

I forgot that one of my options (Dutch Dragon) had jalepenos on it, so I was facin' the heat with my mouth burning for a little before I remembered (I forgot to ask that they remove them).  My other taco was the Ooey-Gooey, substitute with the cilantro-lime sauce.  These tacos got me so PUMPED to go back that I am already planning it. The drop of a star is because our servers never came back to refill drinks until we were practically finished.  With my lil' taste buds simmering in the heat, I really would have liked better service in that (it might have been because we were sitting outside).  I will go back.  Soon.",

I get this isn't the best place to take a child, but we were in the area and also celebrating surviving our first year at being parents.

Even taking our order when we were asking about the chicken and whats on it she was sassy. Then my husband requested his order form back to identify what each taco was, since the menu is so large and she gave him attitude. Even when we got the check she had attitude.  We were only there for 35 minutes and for months I had been looking forward to taking my husband to this place.  Its really sad that our waitresses entire domineer ruined his experience.",

The chips are salted to perfection. The tacos are build your own so you fill out exactly what you want on a little form at your table. They offer lots of options. $3.50 for a taco so prices are reasonable and also the tacos are a decent size. I had 2 and I was stuffed. I recommend the chorizo and shrimp. I really love the tortilla options too...goody goody is my personal fav. On my last trip there the server wasn't very nice and we had to ask twice for water but we did get our food really fast.

The waiting staff was helpful and quick to prepare food. I had the \"Sweet Lucy\" tortilla which is a mix of both hard shell and soft shell, with cheese and guacamole in between them.

Any college student could make these tacos in their dorm room. Our particular server was not very friendly and didn't seem to know the menu very well at all. Her answer to a lot of our questions was \"I don't know.\" Then when we were ready to leave, instead of giving us a detailed receipt, she just said how much we owed. The prices she said were impossible to be correct. But she swore they were correct and gave us attitude when we questioned her. So only AFTER paying would she bring us a detailed receipt, which sure enough had many errors. Maybe she was new and the place was very busy so I'm sure the servers were stressed but everyone in our party was disappointed with the service and cheap tacos. I won't go here again",

It can be a little loud, but its a crowded spot, so that is expected, and the downstairs is a little dark, but its a fun, hip, modern dia de los muertos style atmosphere; the dim lights and the loud music is by no means a negative either, it just adds to the vibe of the restaurant.    Great tacos, margaritas, and guacamole!  I highly suggest the pineapple guacamole, it was so delicious with the sweetness of the pineapple playing with all of the other flavors, and the chipotle honey....I wish I had some right now!  The tuscan was also super delicious, but the pineapple was my absolute favorite, I wish I knew how to make it like this place, because I am salivating just thinking about it!  I love the idea of building your own tacos with a check off system,  but they also have taco suggestions, so you don't have to build your own of you don't want to.   My one coworker and I went upstairs for a drink and guacamole while we waited for others to arrive.  we sat at the bar, and once our friends came, we went downstairs for dinner.    I was with a pretty good size group (about 5 people) and we all did the build your own tacos and had margaritas. We also ordered the tres amigos with a salsa, a queso, and a guacamole.  We had worked a long day, and it was the last day of our work trip, so we were celebrating. My coworker and I were so excited to come here, that we made sure we ate light all day so we could eat as many tacos as possible!   Everyone enjoyed the food so much, we had wished we had time to come back again and again!  I know I will come back next time I am in Pittsburgh!",

It's nice that they offer $3, $4, and $5 taco choices but the flavor was not for me.   I come from Texas where Mexican and tex-mex restaurants probably outnumber Starbucks so I was pleasantly surprised to have found a few restaurants nearby that mirrored those delicious dishes. The only downside outs none of my regulars had happy hour, which brought us to this establishment. Their taco fillings were definitely on the experimental fusion side but tasty. There was one my friend ordered that was completely vegetarian but tasted like pulled pork! Sadly any delicious taco can be crippled with a not so tasty tortilla. The surf n turf taco I ordered was served on a flour tortilla that tasted like those processed package ones you'd find at a grocery store, not like the homemade fresh ones mama makes. If you are going to buy from the store, it's best to just purchase corn. It would surprise and disappoint me further if  the tortillas were made in house.",

    "text": "Decent Mexican food in downtown Pittsburgh. Really enjoyed the vibe of the restaurant and the staff are incredibly helpful. I ended up grabbing dinner here with a coworker while in town for a conference.  The chips and guacamole are a definite go to move. The combination of the sweet salsa on top of the guac is a game changer. Ended up going with three tacos (two Carnitas and one beef) with a side of rice and beans, which were basic with average flavor.  Definitely worth a visit if you're craving Mexican food in downtown Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "This was a pretty mixed experience, that I'll describe in chronological order. When I first arrived, I had to wait near the door until the host would sit the 2 guests ahead of me, and then take my name. However, the host completely ignored the couple, and took a phone call instead that required him to jot down the order for pick-up. There were plenty of open tables and the couple was rightfully outraged and chided the host for being rude and thoughtless. Considering it was noon, I was surprised it was so empty, but I also did not see anyone eating any food. Seemed like the service was awful, as was confirmed by the host, and then of course when I was finally seated at a table for 4, it took a while before a server came to us. 1 star.  Tale of two cities. The food was amazing. I got 3 tacos including the taco of the month for January - Beefy Lucy Taco. The shells were all great, the Lucy was even a bit spicy. The hard shell was surrounded by a soft shell to keep things neat. Each taco was equally delish, and the server even came around for a drink refill 0- halleluhaj(sp?) I'll definitely go back, but will be wary of the service before making it a more regular destination.",

    "text": "This place is totally buzzing and has a great visual feel but was disappointing in food and service.   As a disclaimer, I'm full Mexican and I've been living in LA for three years. I swung through with a group of people that are also all from California. With this in mind, we arrived trying not to have any expectations about how the food would be.   We had a pretty big party (around fifteen) but we were brought upstairs and seated at two adjacent tables, with impressive timing for such a packed place. We grabbed an order of guac and a pitcher of their prickly pear margarita while we decoded the build-your-own menus. Along with our guac, the waitress brought us two paper boats of tortilla chips and two bowls of salsa.   The chips, while they were made of thick tortillas and looked decent, were not warm at all. One boat had a pile of tiny little bits and pieces that were useless for dipping. They were still somewhat tasty, but the cold chips threatened a stale taste and texture.   There are many ways to make salsa, and everyone's recipe is different, but their green salsa really needed work. Maybe it's about sourcing their ingredients, but it had a sourness/acidity that made it obvious the tomatillos either weren't ripe or weren't well-balanced with salt and chile. It was very watery, and was not spicy at all. The red salsa also needed salt, but had good flavor. For the guac we ordered, apart from a very small portion for the price, it had next to no flavor and a mushy consistency that wasn't really appetizing. The pickled red onions on top were a confusing addition.   We had been told the pitcher would cover about four and a half margaritas, and at such a high price point, it was a little sad to see we were juuuuust making it to four portions, some a bit short. The mason jars were a cute touch, though, and we appreciated the ability to split the cost of a pitcher. The flavor did not resemble a prickly pair, and it was very light on tequila, but it was sweet and refreshing.   I ordered one chorizo and one sweet chili tofu taco. In retrospect, the sweet chili sauce flavor made no sense to combine with any salsa and toppings present so that was a mistake on my part. There was no option for soft corn tortillas, which was hugely disappointing, as that is literally how tacos work. I opted for flour instead, and they were cold and sad. My tacos were presented to me mummified in foil and were very small and bare bones.   The chorizo alone was enough to make me pretty upset. It was not a chorizo, at all. I don't understand why it's sold as chorizo. The pale coloration, the ground up texture, and the very strange spice gave no indication it was anywhere close to the hot, deep red and chunky meat it is meant to be.   The service unfortunately did not save the dinner as it could've. It took us forever to flag down the waitress and ask for a glass of water and a salt shaker, as we had no condiments at our table. Upwards of fifteen minutes later, she finally pops by with three cups, with the salt nowhere in sight, and never brought to us. It was even longer to flag her down for the check- maybe fifteen or twenty straight minutes of waving every time she speed walked by and never getting her attention. It was twenty minutes between her printing the bill and us trying to get her to pick it up. Overall we wasted about an hour just trying to get out, and we were all really frustrated.   It was obviously popular, and I can't deny it was pretty hip and cool, but I wouldn't want any of my friends to come here. The food is beyond recognition, and the few servers around couldn't work fast enough to balance the packed restaurant.",

    "text": "Condado Tacos opened up on the corner in downtown Pittsburgh in what used to be a spot occupied by Tonic Bar & Grill. Tonic wasn't bad, but I think Condado is extremely creative and has amazing potential when you compare it with Tonic. Condado's affordability and flair combined with my love of tacos makes me wonder why I waited this long to try it, but I'm glad I finally paid it a visit to see what the hype was about.  It was lunch hour, and I don't eat out often, but a friend of mine is a big fan and suggested we go to Condado as a payday treat to ourselves. She was raving about the queso, so as soon as we arrived we put in an order for it. The queso was fantastic, gooey, warm, and everything you want in a bowl of melty cheese. They had some other queso options aside from the classic plain queso, and I took an order of the dirty queso home to enjoy. The dirty queso had beans, shredded chicken, and a hot pepper sauce in it that was to die for!  Next we were on to ordering our tacos. It's a simple process, you get a sheet and a pencil and check off what you'd like on your taco. One of my favorite things was the special taco shells. I tried the Sweet Lucy, which was a hard shell and a soft shell with queso and guac in between the shells. It was so good! I got one of my two tacos plain soft taco style, and the shell ripped apart and made it hard to eat. Go for the hard and soft shell combo, you won't regret it. The first of my two tacos was the sweet chili tofu, which was delicious. If anything they could've been more generous with the tofu rather than loading up on toppings, but it was still good. The other that I chose was a chicken taco. It wasn't that the chicken wasn't good, but it was cold. I'm not a fan of cold chicken at all, especially not in tacos. There were a good bit of toppings on it, but it shouldn't have been straight-out-of-the-fridge cold. The flavors were there, but I'm going to be wary of ordering chicken again here because of this.  Overall, for 2 sauced up tacos, an order of rice, beans, and sour cream (all $1 each), and an order of dirty queso to go, my total was around $20. Not bad for a lunch and a takeaway of queso with a big bag of chips. I'd come back to Condado, but maybe just for margaritas and queso next time. I'd definitely give the tacos another chance at some point, but I'm not in a rush.",

A lot of restaurants were closed even though this major event was taking place -- not great planning on business's part, I'd think.   Anyway, after walking around seeing most places not open, we spotted Condado Tacos and strode in.  Soooo very glad we did!  First of all it's enticing just visually -- all around you is art -- on the walls, on the stairs (don't forget to look at those stairs)!   I was impressed by that alone.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was very friendly and helpful.  We ordered some tacos and were given some chips and salsa.  I had shrimp in mine and was very happy, indeed.  When all was said and done and eaten, the final bill was around 20 dollars for the two of us.  I'd say that was a fair meal and a tasty one, too!  When I posted pics of this place on FB, I was surprised when several of my friends said it was their favorite taco place.  Why the heck am I just finding out about it??  Well, at least I have now!",

We came on a Friday evening, this place was BUSY...it is extremely popular, however I must say that the wait wasn't that long.   I very much enjoyed my tacos (I think I enjoyed the ones I 'built' myself rather than the pre-done ones already on the menu). I won't even bother to specify what I had because I had several (and am ashamed) and I think you'll be happy with whichever you choose. The sangria is ok, not to toot my own horn but I think I can make better at home...also the pitcher is of poor value because it was mostly ice.   Some negative points to note:  There are no fish taco options  You cannot order the refried beans without bacon (my mother in law is vegetarian and was really disappointed by this)  The service really is not that great, I do have to echo what I saw some others have said here. I took away a star for the service: our server was not attentive to the table, we had to ask for water and even then it took 20 minutes from someone to bring it...of course when we asked for the check, they brought that SUPER quickly :/",

Their proportion to price ratio, fresh tasting ingredients and choices are so good.   Last night, I had a dinner with a vegetarian and I should mention that they were very please with their options for ordering. We split the queso (w/ corn) and were very pleased.    I also got the surf n'turf taco as well as the Dutch Dragon. I get the Dutch Dragon every time, I absolutely loved all the vegetables and fresh tasting combination with both the hard and soft shells.  You can build your own, but I love Condado's suggestions and have yet to get one I did not like.   Atmosphere: It is a little loud, so if you are looking to have a serious in depth conversation it may not be your best option, especially on weekends.   Service: I've always had great service there and the staff is always on top of things and keeps things moving so even if there is a line out the door on weekends. The wait was only 20 min last night and they text your cell phone when your table is ready so we walked around downtown for a little bit.   Happy Hour: Although I was not there for happy hour last night, it is a place I frequent. Their tacos (downstairs only) are all $1 off and you can get $3 margs (including their special vs the original). If we want tacos for happy hour, this is without a doubt the place we will go.",

Endless combinations as you can opt for the build your own option. Vegetarian options are great too. Also lots of fun queso options. I've been here several times and the spice level has varied across visits but we usually go to for the Diablo queso. Bathrooms haven't always been the cleanest unfortunately, but it's a bar downtown so I think it happens. If you love tacos and haven't been to Condado yet, get there!",

We were able to get in right when it opened and sat on the second floor. The waiter immediately greeted us with water and asked if we wanted to start our Memorial Day off right with a shot of tequila We had to pass but they have an open bar for anyone wanting a drink or two.   The way the ordering works is similar to ordering sushi. There are pads of paper that have a variety of ingredients from your tortilla to protein to salsas.   They also have a pad of \"suggestions\" of taco creations. You can also make taco to go which they prepare after bringing your dine in order our.   I will definitely be back to have the goody goody! It was delicious! I got that with one chicken and one brisket - sour cream, salsa and cheese. The goody goody comes with sour cream, guacamole and some crunchy goodness. Good thing they brought my order sheet back so I can share it.   The service was good and the price was affordable.",

But Pittsburgh has so many Mexican food restaurants, and this was very underwhelming to me. We got a trio of dips and the guac tasted very store bought to me :( I made my own tacos, so me not liking them could very well be my fault, but everything was just small and didn't stand out. To be fair, it's very inexpensive. The atmosphere is great and I would absolutely go back and maybe not try to make such a fun taco and just do something basic, I might have been just doing too much. Overall, just wasn't loving it.",

Skip the salsa verde, it like the margarita pitcher is incredibly watered down and not worth the price. We asked for more tequila in the marg pitcher bc it literally tastes like simple syrup on ice and the waiter said it came from a premise mix... nough said. Not to mention our waiter got us to get the blood orange margarita bc he already had one made yet it still took 5-10 minutes to get to the table. We expressed how disappointed we were by the margs (as evidenced by no one drinking it) and he took it and the mostly full pitcher off the table. Skip this place if you're going for drinks, but the food is decent and fairly priced.",

The food is good and the price is right on point with what you should pay for tacos in a Downtown Pittsburgh location. There is a downstairs and upstairs, giving it plenty of space for patrons.  You build your own tacos here. You fill out a form of what you want and the quantity you want. They also have a few \"house\" recommended ones on another form you can fill out. Great variety on everything from taco shells, meat, and sauces. You could make a TON of different tacos if you wanted. I had three totally different tacos. I loved them all! We also ordered an order of chips with gauc + two salsas. I think that was actually my favorite part. I lied... the pitcher of peach margaritas was my favorite part.

On one hand, I liked the decor and the overall vibe of the place, and I generally liked my tacos; but on the other hand, I was super overwhelmed and unsure of the create your own taco menu.   It could have honestly been a combination of not being sure how all the toppings would taste with the proteins I chose and the lack of description/explanation from our server. Basically, I happened to make a few lucky choices and enjoyed my meal. My friends went through the same battle and, while a few of us chose the exact same taco, they looked completely different. One girl appeared to have the table's portions of cilantro entirely in one taco, other tacos were missing guacamole, and the sauces on a few were completely skipped. I think a quality control check is needed!  Lastly, they had a million different menus. I don't get it. There was a create your own taco menu, a premade taco menu, a drink menu with beer/liquor and then some other drink menu. Just combine them. Too much going on, too many moving parts.   I'm willing to take another shot at Condado because I did enjoy the flavors, I just hope it's easier for me to navigate the menu!",

    "text": "Came here on a Wednesday night with a friend to try the much talked about tacos. I'll be candid and say that I was not a fan of this place for 3 reasons: 1. The tacos are mediocre. I'm a pretty tough critic because my comparison is living in Austin, TX for 4 years, in the land of tacos. The meat in both my tacos was cold when it arrived. We also ordered queso and chips and the cheese congealed even before we paid the bill (there is a way that the queso gods make it that doesn't congeal...I don't know what it is, but I've had it) 2. The ordering system is less than ideal. They give you two columns of filling in open bubbles for what you'd like...the problem is, that doesn't allow you to order multiple tacos of different ingredients. I had to choose 2 tacos and pick exactly what shell, filling, and topping I wanted. Or I had to write the quantity in the open box for the same exact taco. This is limiting. 3. The space itself is SO tiny. I was practically eating at the tables of other people and in their conversations.  The wait staff had to squeeze by every single table when running to and from the kitchen. I can imagine this bothers them, so it has to bother the eaters at their establishment.   I think with a change in the menu, some alterations of seating, and some study of better ingredients this place could be better, but I'm just not sold.",

First issue: time proximity was \"2 drinks\", literally that's what they said. Which in retrospect is probably just their way of getting me to drink. I'm thinking 30-45 minutes. Even though we left we still did not receive a text until over 2 hours  later. My issue here is that if it's going to be long and it's going to be 2 hours just let me know. I'll have my drinks and leave. When we asked (an hour in) how long, they wouldn't give us any estimate? Just kept saying \"a long time\". At least tell me how many people were in front of me!  Another thing: honestly the margs were not that good. They were ok.   I don't like non up front answers and I don't like withholding information on how long the wait may be. Needless to say we left and got Italian food.",

    "text": "It's a shame that their food was amazing but the service was unbelievably terrible. I will not recommend Condado Tacos to anyone.  Condado Tacos was a 10 minute walk away from our hotel so we thought it'd be nice to walk and explore the city instead of driving there. Upon arrival, the hostess explained about the happy hour special and the upstairs seating situation. We opt to eat upstairs and pay everything regular price because we were starving (and a bit tired).   Downstairs has a pub/bar style going on, and upstairs is your regular hippy, cool, relaxed Mexican restaurant. Our waitress asked if we've been here before and if we knew how to order - we told her no. So she went on to taking our drinks order and left. We thought the drinks would come quickly so she'll explain how things work here when she's back, but after a pretty long wait, not only were we still waiting for the drinks, we were left there confused with the menu. I had to flag her down and ask, which is when she finally told us how to make your own taco and write them down on the sheets. She also reassured us to start small and order more later on because the service here is very fast.  We ordered 2 drinks initially, then we got 2 Bubba Kush, 2 Chronic Tortilla Fritos, and 1 make your own taco. One of our drinks finally came, then the Fritos and our self-created taco arrived. Almost finishing our meal, I reminded our server about our second drink. This was after waiting for about 15 minutes for our food and drinks, and at least another 15 minutes into our meal, and we were still waiting for our second drink. With no apologies, our waitress disappeared once again, and was back with our second drink after awhile.   And it just gets worse...we were done with the Fritos and taco, we were just sitting there and chatting, because we expected our 2 Bubba Kush to eventually arrive. After being in the restaurant with no attention from our server, and waiting for the rest of our food for about 20 minutes after finishing all our food on the table, we gave up. We asked for the bill and left.   Don't get me wrong, the tacos were amazing, but the service was unbelievable - even though she had some cool purple lipstick on. I'd rather go to McDonalds for a better time.",

Condado Tacos has tacos already set with their combo of ingredients, but they also have the option to make your own. I went with the Dutch dragon, which had spicy portabella mushroom, cabbage, and the regular fixings like salsa and corn. The special thing about this restaurant's tacos is that they have a hard shell that's wrapped in a soft shell, held together by guacamole. I've never seen anything like this. You get two different textures with just one bite. It's truly a revolutionary idea. If you want to try something other than a taco, they also have a purple haze bowl. This bowl had tofu, red cabbage, and pickled onions. The pickled onions were a very nice touch and added depth to the dish. I would definitely go back to Condado Tacos to satisfy my taco cravings.",

    "text": "Pittsburgh seems to be getting a lot of hipster taco joints lately, and you know what?  I ain't mad about it.  The Mexican food scene around here is pretty weak because we don't have much of an immigrant population to speak of, so not a lot of options if you're like me and love going to a hole in the wall with someone's Abuela in the kitchen, you know?  And you know what?  I ain't really mad about that either.  I lived in SoCal for 8 years and had all that time to get my fill since my own Abuela went to see Jesus decades ago.    Anyway, I am happy that tacos have taken on a life of their own outside of a cheesy Mexican restaurant chain context, much like pizza has.  Their MTO concept is a teensy bit confusing at first, but once you get the hang of it, it's cool.  They even have some pre-made combos for you to choose from, which is what my friend got because she didn't trust her judgment to put together a good taco.  She says they were good, but pretty loaded and filling.  I myself went pretty simple, limiting myself to about 3 ingredients including the protein.  They were very good, but I was a little taken aback by the corn tacos being hard shell and not soft like the street tacos I'm used to.  It's not necessarily a bad thing, but something to take note of if you're not into hard shell.  A couple of my tacos were chicken, and the meat was very juicy and can make the shell soggy if you don't get to it quick enough, so heads up.  We also split an order of the guac and it had a nice little kick to it.   One thing to note is that the HH specials is just in the downstairs bar area.  If you want a table upstairs, you'll probably have to wait because the place isn't that big to begin with, and it draws a nice crowd if there's a game in town.",

As someone who travels regularly to Texas and grew up visiting Texas and eating fantastic Tex Mex and Mexican food Condado tacos is only average in Pittsburgh.  It's be closed in months in any area South with any semblance of actual Mexican cuisine Tex mex or more authentic.  The key point of any Mexican restaurant is do they have fresh tortillas? Flour or corn and Condado's tacos are some of the worst tortillas I've ever had.  The only reason I give Condado 3 stars is their dips such as salsa and queso are a solid choice. Their specials on drinks and price isn't too bad for downtown Pittsburgh either.  I'd love to share with you more about the actual taco which sans the horrible tortilla was sub-par. There's just not positive comments about their tacos.  Go down the road to the Strip instead.",

There were so many creative options to choose from and the flavors were great. Definitely something different than any ordinary taco I would usually order. We also had the queso as an app. Their queso was fantastic! They also have delicious margarita options and a huge drink menu to select from. I had the blackberry and strawberry margarita and it was awesome. I even tried my friends mojito, which I normally wouldn't order, but it was also delicious. The only downfall was service was a bit too slow, but the food and drinks made up for it. We can't wait to return!",

There are so many toppings that they all just end up muddy, the sauces either cancel each other out in their mildness or are just spicy without flavor, and neither the chorizo nor jackfruit proteins really had much seasoning. It's fine for the price, especially at happy hour, and it's not bad, but it's not food that I especially enjoy eating.",

As a new staple in the cultural district, and downtown in general, Condado is an awesome choice that doesn't break the bank and that's sometimes hard to find downtown!   The atmosphere is unique and exciting with two floors, both featuring their own full service bar! I went on a Saturday around noon before an event at the convention center and we were able to get a table without a wait.   The menu features both create-your-own tacos ad well as predesigned tacos. I decided to go with the ones they had created! I ordered an ooey gooey and and el tradicional. They ooey gooey rocked my world while the other left me wanting more. I didn't love the soft corn tortilla. We also split an order of queso and be prepared for a huge bowl to come your way. I don't ever do Mexican without queso and this didn't disappoint.   When the bill came and all was said and done it was $12...I was full, happy, and ready to go! I can't wait to go back and design some of my own tacos next time and check out more of their queso varieties!",

I stopped in for lunch with a friend on Saturday afternoon. There was plenty of availability for seating, both upstairs and downstairs.   I ordered the blanco queso and two tacos: one surf and turf and one bubba kush. The queso was divine and there was so much of it--your dollar goes far here. The tacos arrived almost a minute after the queso (the service was so fast!) and they were also delicious. The bacon black beans on the Bubba Kush taco were smokey and delicious. I also enjoyed how the crunchy corn tortilla was wrapped in a flour tortilla, so you get the crunch but everything holds together. The surf and turf taco (only $5!) comes with steak and shrimp ceviche. The flavor was excellent but there were so many flavors going on that it was hard to find the ceviche at times, though everything still tasted great.   Condado is affordable with some excellent tacos! You can also build your own, but I decided to go with the recommended combinations and was not disappointed!",

It was soaked from the juice it sits in and made the whole taco fall apart. The honey chipotle sauce is delicious and it compliments mostly everything.   The basil blueberry margarita was overrated sadly. I tasted no basil and the blueberries were lack luster. I tasted mostly just tequila and nothing else.   I still find this place to be a unique taco restaurant in Pittsburgh and it's enjoyable every time.",

I consider myself to be a bit of a queso connoisseur and in my opinion, they have the best in the city. The chips are thick and served fresh. The taco offerings are unique and flavorful. I love the option to build-your-own with a sheet to fill out at your table so you can take your time and really think about all of the wonderful combinations you could make, but their house creations are excellent too. My favorite is the El Santo. The decor is fun (those skull lights, swoon!) and the atmosphere is lively, especially at happy hour.   As for why I knocked off a star.... the sides are cheap but the portions are very small - the guac was just okay and the bacon refried beans were extremely disappointing. For some reason, they reminded me of old KFC mashed potatoes in both taste and texture. Yeah, kinda gross. Also, every time I've been here, the service has been somewhere between awful to mediocre. Don't get me wrong, it's not going to stop me from coming back for that sweet, sweet queso. But I really wish it could be served to me by someone who seemed to actually enjoy their job.",

The waiter who waited on our table is very patient and explained to us about filling out the menu card which requires some effort that is totally worth for the food they serve.  I ordered tofu in one of the tacos and I don't regret going for that unusual combination. The tacos are huge and I ordered 3 of them. Two with tofu and one with some regular fillings. They are delicious and I highly recommend the hard shell tacos.   I should also mention that they are the most ergonomic tacos which are easy to eat without making a mess!

We had a bad restaurant experience and got this place after a few cocktails.  Will be back to try more.",

The amazing staff at Condado instead brought tables and seating back out for our group, and made sure our pups had water to drink. The food was as amazing as our service. At $6 their nachos are a steal. We will be back!",

Granted, it recently opened so I guess that certainly helps, but I certainly did not expect it to be so full! As such, I proceeded to order out as there was no way I was going to wait to be seated. There are two ways to order: 1) either presets on a menu or 2) make-your-own where you can customize different aspects of your taco with some ingredients costing extra. In general, the tacos here are pretty good and reasonably priced. They have some pretty interesting ingredients and combinations that can be made with such ingredients on the menu, which I personally found pretty intriguing and certainly not something you find at some of the other taco places that I've been to in the 'burgh. All in all, the tacos tasted great ... packed with flavor, freshly made, and reasonably priced. I certainly would recommend at least a try if you are into tacos of any kind. Oh and there's a bar too, if you're into that kind of thing as well, lol.",

A tad loud, but when I went (Saturday evening), it was to be expected; 5) the nachos - we got a mountain of nachos, far more than I expected, and they were excellent; 6) Margaritas - we got a pitcher of them, and we got plenty of delicious margaritas to go around!

We got seated right away and even got a seat on their patio area.  I consider myself a queso connoisseur and their queso is bomb.  Honestly though, the tacos were the best part.

We sat at the downstairs bar. Menu was super impressive. There's a smaller list of \"already made\" tacos you can just order. Or you can use their huge list to create your own!! We just ordered a few off the already made list and we'll make our own next time. We first got the pineapple guac & chips - holy cow. Never had guac like that before. The only downfall, the chips were really greasy. Onto tacos... I got a taco with chicken (forget the name - queso fresco, pollo,..) and it was SO GOOD. Also got a pulled pork one - even better!! My boyfriend also got the pulled pork one and 2 chorizo. He really liked them all!... keep in mind, the tacos are BIGGER than the other taco places in Pittsburgh so you don't need to order as many. I was stuffed after sharing guac & eating 2 tacos. We actually took some guac & chips home. Service was awesome - quick & very attentive. Can't wait to go back again!!",

Starting at $3, they allow you to customize your taco from shell to sauce, the whole enchilada.  You can easily get away with eating in for $10-$15.  The margaritas looked really good too (and cheap), but haven't yet indulged on that yet.  Also - they have a loyalty card that's gets you $5 back on every $50 you spend.  Happy hour takes a $1 off tacos and Margaritas, so you definitely can't go wrong (5-7PM).",

I tried the pineapple salsa it was great. 10/10.",

I was there a couple days ago and I got something to go for my husband and my friend and I dined in. The food came out so quickly, and we were super grateful for that, however, now that it's been 24 hrs, we think that some of the food must have been sitting out.   My husband has been throwing up all night, and my friend has diarrhea and nausea.   It sucks because the food was so good, but two separate people that had separate meals, one who dined in and one who had take out are both extremely sick. I encourage this restaurant to not be lazy and cook all of their food in a timely fashion. People go to restaurants expecting to wait. Don't cut corners. I pray this is just a temporary bug.",

I did like the vibe, and this place was pretty crowded even on a Monday night as I ordered at the bar.   This lived up to 100% of the yelp hype. I wish this existed where I live, because trendy Mexican places for a night out fall so flat. I just about died when I saw the Ju-Ju and Sweet Lucy tortilla options. Queso + chorizo, or queso + guac between the 2 shells? I'm already in heaven and I haven't even figured out what to put in the shells.   I'm a spice lover, and loved all the sauce options. Price was appropriate for what we got. Would return for a friends night out if I lived here!",

    "text": "I had heard that this is lace was amazing from a Mexican food loving friend-who highly recommended I try Condado Tacos. The food was pretty good-queso was pretty ordinary and one note in flavor-you can skip it entirely in my opinion. It really just tasted like melted Velveeta, and really not much more than that. Don't waste your calories. The chips were hearty and very salty-too salty. The tacos however-to die for!! Definitely try the layered taco, I think called Lucy. I had it with roast chicken, rice& beans, cilantro & onions & chipotle creama. Absolutely delish & beyond!!! However-the service here is really lacking. Our waitress took forever to get to us. Drinks were pretty quick. But we asked for hot sauce to give the bland, not warm, tasteless queso some flavor-she never came back. Food runners brought our food. No one ever came back to check on us-NOT ONCE!! Is this just a Pittsburgh lack of training thing?  And then, there was my absolute favorite Pittsburgh lousy service thing-the waitress drops our check off on the dirty table-never asked \"how was your meal,\" let alone clearing the dirty table before asking me to pay my check-what is with this??? I waited tables for years. We were trained to NEVER present a check to a dirty table! Clear it first!! Have a little pride in what you're doing!! So I'm supposed to tip for slow, spotty, mostly missing service?? And then a check presented to me on my still dirty table-with a \"I'll take this when you're ready,\" as she walks away. Yeah, I did tip. But not what I would have, that is for sure. And-it was not busy! All the wait staff were huddled near the end of the bar having a chat. I just don't get it. The food was mostly good. Service not so much. Will I be back? Maybe. Not likely though.",

I was a regular when this location first opened up, had one of their membership cards and everything. But now the entire staff has changed and the newer bartenders have an attitude. I sat in here for 10 minutes today with the bartenders walking by giving service to other patrons around me, never got a hello. It wasn't even busy. I walked out and I don't think they even noticed. It's a shame because it's one of the only spots where you can get vegan food downtown, but it's not worth it. I don't care about being hip enough for tacos and $6 drafts. The place is surrounded by other bars that want your money more. What a shame RIP",

I got the tofu on one and the portobello on the other. I'm vegan so I don't eat meat, but I still feel like the textures wouldn't match. They also didn't put that much in the actual taco. There was barely any filling. I could go to Doce Tacqueria and get a hefty taco and pay less than what I paid at Condado. Even Bakersfield across the street stuffs their tiny little tacos more than this. The guy who served me was super nice and great at his job, very friendly and welcoming. But Overall I probably wouldn't go back unless friends wanted to go or were paying for my food.",

I even saved my chorizo taco last (unaware of the change) and was left semi-disgusted and questioning, \"what the heck is wrong with my favorite taco?? Is this cinnamon?!\" Even asking my boyfriend to try it for a second opinion. Yes, it was cinnamon--verified by two sets of taste buds and a wonderful bartender. Apparently, this complaint has been made from other patrons and by confirming my strong distaste of this MAJOR change, I have decided to write a review, (which I never do, ever) so yinz can all hear it in the back!!! CINNAMON DOES NOT BELONG IN CHORIZO!  please fix it. Love, an original chorizo recipe lover.

It is basically a chicken taco with queso fresco. The twist is that it is in a soft and crunchy taco shell with some sort of sauce between.   I also ordered the pomegranate margarita and the prickly pear margarita. They were both easy to drink and tasted like they were freshly made and not from some super sweet premixed bottle.   The only negatives were that the free tacos were still on the bill when it came. The server corrected that and when I asked for a refill on the salsa the server brought out another order and charged us for it. Both of these problems were due to it being opening night and super busy.   I'll definitely be back, especially when they open the rooftop deck.",

It was packed on a Saturday night so I ordered takeout. The hostess and bartender were very helpful and my order was out in less than 10 minutes. Both the Mantis and the Dutch Dragon were absolutely delicious. It can be tough to find creative and tasty vegetarian tacos and the flavors in both of these were perfect! I will be back :)",

    "text": "To the extremely stressed out waitress that just talked down to me without provocation - I'm SO incredibly sorry. The hostess told my husband and I that we were next to sit outside so when a couple left we waited around but given the extremely crowded environment we proceeded to sit down and patiently wait for service. Please understand that we had no way of knowing that you were \"holding the table\" for the previous patrons who were out in the crowd enjoying the concert. Also please note that it is not standard procedure to \"hold\" unbussed tables in a crowded restaurant while patrons go off to participate in other activities. Frankly, it sounds risky from a walk-out-on-the-bill perspective but hey I'm not here to judge. But I would like to share a basic customer service tip: try to maintain a professional tone when speaking to patrons irregardless of your stress level especially when they do something intuitive like sit at an empty table. It's our first time in Pittsburg and it's a busy Friday night. We had attempted to get a table at two other places before arriving at your restaurant, we're tired, we're hungry but we are respectful. We didn't deserve your tone, you talked down to us as if you were dealing with a pair of irate assholes when we were simply confused - confused that you had walked by us multiple times but failed to mention we were grossly infringing on your \"reserved\" table ... confused that you're suddenly back and telling us to \"take it up with management ...\" wait? what? Remember me? About 10 minutes prior when you could barely get through all the people I sympathized with you ... I leaned over and commented on how difficult your job must be tonight ... Why are you suddenly talking down to us? You turned business away from your employer tonight and left a small stain on what would have otherwise been a lovely evening.",

I arrived tonight and was pushed past by other guests, who were seated before me and my partner (including a party of 6).   One hostess thought I was part of another party, but I explained we were trying to put our name on the list. This hostess didn't take our names, she just went to the host stand to seat a party. I waited patiently because I have worked in the industry and was trying to not rush them. This same hostess said nothing when another couple pushed past us and got their names on the list with a different hostess.   When we were called, they attempted to seat me at a cramped high top table squeezed between other people. When they realized that wasn't going to work, they asked about going upstairs. Then they told us that we would have to go back on the waitlist. I've worked in restaurants for over 12 years as a host and server. Asking guests about accommodations is the industry standard. I felt so upset by the disorganization that I told them that we had been cut off by others and that I wanted to leave.    Never before have I left somewhere feeling like my business was worth less, like here.",

You can walk away with a taco at around $3.50 or you can build a mansion on top of that taco (Aka mine) and spend $5.50. I come here starving every time, and my two favorites to get are the Sweet Lucy & the Ju-Ju. I get about 10 toppings on each and get 2 tacos every time. I am STUFFED!! So worth it! Tacos are great, drinks are delicious and chorizo-queso is amazing. They have a great salsa and guacamole option as well!!  If you think about it, it is kinda of like Burgatory but got TACOS!! Can you think of anything more genius!? Go ahead, I'll wait :-) ENJOY!",

I tried one of their recommendations...surf and turf and then crated my own. By the time in got to me the create your own with chicken was not just 'not hot,' but actively cold. I think it's that both the corn salsa and cabbage slaw came straight from the fridge. When I bit into my taco, my teeth got sensitive from the cold. Now I have sensitive teeth. But still! I will say that the flavor of their black beans and guacamole was great.  My rec: come for a drink and order the guacamole, beans and queso . Let's leave the tacos to Texas, mkay?",

This isn't really authentic Mexican, it's more of a street taco type of situation. You sit down, and they have a pad of paper that has a checklist on it. You basically just check what kind of shell you want and what kind of toppings you want on your taco. The way just comes and takes your drink order and the little slips with your taco order on it. A few minutes later, voila! Your perfect tacos are delivered! Love the atmosphere. Fast service. GREAT TACOS. Favorite stop in Pittsburgh.",

I recommend the peezler since it has a hard shell wrapped around a soft tortilla... best of both worlds  for appetizers definitely try out the queso diablo which is red hot peppers mixed into the gooey queso! The margarita is good but sometimes I feel like it's watered down. To avoid that get the skinny margarita. Finally they have a bunch of these locations throughout Pittsburgh, Columbus, and Cleveland so I make sure to stop by one whenever I'm in those cities",

You won't regret it if you enjoy Italian flavors and don't mind fusion.   Had the regular blanco queso. It was appropriately Tex-Mexy, which I appreciated.   I wouldn't mind having some more varied vegetarian options for the tacos. I love tofu but can't handle spice, so I couldn't do the tofu option. Maybe a milder tofu option would help round out the menu.   Anyway, the vibe is cool and the service is great. And I'm totally wrong about the tacos, so you'll love them.",

I recommend making your own custom taco, it starts at $3.5 and you can add whatever you want to it and it gets very filling (maximum 3 tacos for when I'm hungry). the double shelled (soft and hard) are definitely worth if you want a change of texture in your tacos. I came here for my 21st birthday and ordered a strawberry margarita (~$7), it was very strong but was pretty tasty. the service is also very kind and accommodating!   tldr; food 5/5 service 5/5",

The server that we had was very talkative - in a way that we couldn't get a word or question in and when we did, she wouldn't really stop talking long enough to actually hear what we were saying. She basically heard a word and then cut us off or never heard us at all and apparently did what she thought that we said - hence my very simplistic request with my queso order (no peppers or garnish).

The service at the bar was good.  You have the option to build your own taco or order from the menu.   I chose the \"El Santo\" & \"Bubba Kush\" tacos.  I loved them both but liked the Bubba Kush more.. it made my taste buds happy.  The tacos were nestled with hard and soft tacos.. love that!   I like the build your own taco option.   I will definitely return with the boyfriend to check out the dining experience.",

If you're familiar with the Custom Sheets at Burgatory, then you get the concept behind Condado. Pick your shell, protein, cheese, and fixin's... You're in charge. I can't recommend the juicy marinated Portobello mushrooms or the Shrimp Ceviche enough! And the picked red onions are PHENOMENAL as an add-on! Of course, there are House Tacos that you can choose from if you don't like hard choices (\"What kind of sauce do I choose???? Chorizo or Brisket for protein?) Everything is rad, promise.  Then, another important choice: What kind of margarita? You can always roll classic, but if you're daring, the Muddled Jalapeno Marg is FIRE. (Haha, yes, I crack myself up...)  Located right at the edge of the notorious Cultural District, Condado is a prime choice for food after any event. Just be warned: Going any time after 30 minutes prior to Happy Hour (Beginning at 4:00) might mean you're camping out for a bit!",

We arrived at about 6:45 on a Saturday night and it was PACKED. The hostess told us it would be a 30 minute wait, so we awkwardly stood in the corner of the restaurant waiting for a bar seat. Luckily it only ended up being about a 15 minute wait!   We both tried the peach margarita and it was delicious! Neither of us were disappointed. They had many unique flavors such as banana, pomegranate, and rosemary.  For dinner, we decided to build our own tacos. It was pretty cool that you could pick your shell and all of its contents to your liking! I ended up only getting one taco because we had the queso blanco as an appetizer, but I do wish I would have gotten two. The homemade tortilla chips were thick, crispy, and went perfect with the cheese dip!   Overall, I really enjoyed my visit to Condado and would definitely try it out again!",

He walked away, removed something from a bench, came back and told me he would seat me upstairs...there were two tables in plain sight that were ready and empty. After being seated upstairs I was greeted, wonderfully I might add, by a waitress-Julia. She was all similes and extremely accommodating.  I gave my order of a marguerita,  extra salt, and nachos, custom ordered. She continuously checked on me and made sure I was ok. The marguerita was bland, but the nachos were delicous!

I tried to come here before but when I got to the restaurant it was unexpectedly closed but yet nothing was stated on social media. Regardless I tried this place tonight. It was very crowded for a Tuesday night which was good and very lively. My date and I ordered the queso and guacamole to start with. They were not flavorful. In fact guacamole I've made at home using McCormick spice pack tasted better. There needed to be more lime and cilantro. Next we did the make your own taco. They were ok.  If you do make your own taco I recommend the Lucy shell with hard and soft taco. Also the surf and turf taco is pretty good. But other than that there is Nothing really stellar to report about them. We got the margaritas which were good which is the most redeeming part of the night.",

You must get the queso & guac filled Sweet Lucy shell for at least one taco, and if you're at all a fan of tofu, you need to try their Thai Chili Tofu (I order it every time I go and have even replicated it at home for friends and family-it's that good!). Now, the tacos can get pretty big depending on what all you put in them, and I have never eaten more than two. If we're ordering margs and apps, then I can barely even finish one! I'd suggest starting out with one then ordering another if you're still hungry when you finish. Speaking of margs, I'm unfortunately not too big a fan of theirs as I find them to be too sweet and syrupy. Luckily, they have a decent beer selection. Now, this place does tend to get crowded on Thurs-Sat evenings, so if you're coming for dinner, I'd get here 30-45 mins before you wanna eat",

The chicken is pretty good choice for protein. We also had the seasonal queso (red pepper). The queso was delicious and the chips were on point (replenished if needed).  Maybe we just had a bad batch of tacos when we were there. The staff was very nice and the service was good.",

Now that we got the foods out the way, let's get on to the experience and some minor concerns. We did come during Happy Hour, that has awesome happy hour prices. Of course it was a bit busy but super loud in there. The seating area on the bottom area can feel a bit cramped during the busy times. There is a second floor but I am not sure of the layout. At first, we felt annoyed by the lack of attentiveness to get started with out order. But again, like I said it was busy. Once we were with our waitress, she was on top of things. It was just a slow start  The margaritas are a part of the happy hour special. (Half hour margaritas and a 1$ dollar off tacos) The margaritas were very weak! I usually can feel a margarita the first glass. They need to kick it up a notch. What's the point of drinking a margarita without  kick and fun!? However, this restaurant is the place to hit if you have a craving for a taco that makes you melt and wanna slap your mama. I heard they are opening one in Lawrenceville. And I can't wait to continue eating to Ooey Gooey taco, and try more.",

And as a jalapeno margarita afficiando, I have to say, the muddled jalapeno margarita was superb.   For $3.50 per taco, it's hard to beat as a lunchtime spot. Drinks outside of happy hour can add up, but the pitcher deal is perfect if you're with a few friends and only looking for a drink or two!",

    "text": "I feel like I am supposed to love this Taco spot, but for me it fell short and was a confusing experience.  We were seated quickly on a Saturday afternoon. The place is super small so I can see it becoming packed on a normal night. The atmosphere and decor was super cool and had a really nice vibe. I was excited!  I sat down to what felt like 6 menus and had no idea what to do with no direction from our server. I first ordered the margarita flight because they had about 10 different margarita flavors. I had the blackberry, strawberry and pomegranate. They were fresh and delicious!! We also had the queso appetizer. The queso was thick and creamy, mmmm. However, I was not a fan of the homemade chips. They were so thick and greasy it totally took away the flavor of the queso. I know most people like chips like this, but I'll pass.  I ordered 2 tacos. I would love to say what I had- but I honestly have no idea. There are a ton of options so you can be as crazy or as basic as you would like. I got both with chicken. One in a four shell, one in the sweet Lucy shell. This shell had guac in it, which I do not like, but there was nowhere to request no guac on the sheet. I meant to tell the server, but forgot which is my fault. However it would be nice if they went over your choices with you when you hand them your sheet. My one taco I got pineapple salsa which was delicious, however the chicken was sort of blan for me. My other taco I got one of the cream sauces which was also very good. Both tacos for me just tasted like the sauce, which was yummy but I wanted more. Next time I will try one of their speciality made tacos. (There are good options for vegetarians, too!)  The food comes out SO FAST. Which is great however I had no time to drink my margarita flight so next time I probably would not get a drink or even appetizer. This would be great during a quick lunch rush, though.  The prices here are awesome. Each taco is $3.50 with certain upcharges and specialty tacos being more. Happy hour is $1 off tacos and there are drink specials! You cannot beat that.  Overall everything was good, but not great. I will be back to try again.",

Totally customizable, you can create multiple tacos, each one with a different flavor and taste. I made one of mine spicy and one sweet, the perfect balance.  They have margaritas made in house and I would get one in a heartbeat if you can!",

    "text": "I've been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner, and both meals were great! VERY reasonably priced! You can easily get lunch for around $10.  This place seems to have gotten very popular very quickly, so I'd suggest getting in before the lunch or dinner rush. The downstairs dining room is a little overwhelming when it's crowded because the tables are quite close together and it's very loud. There is not much room for the staff or customers to walk through when it's packed. This would not turn me off but I know it would for some people.  I love the menu. They have a menu of suggested tacos and then a \"Build-your-own\" option where you select your shell, protein, toppings, sauce, etc. My favorite shell is the Sweet Lucy which is a hard shell in a soft shell with queso and quac in between. You can't get much better than that. I absolutely loved the combo of the brisket with the jicama & cabbage slaw and pickled onions. We also got an order of queso to split for the table and I'll have to order that every single time I go in. Their chips are amazing! Pair all that with an original margarita on the rocks with salt and I'm a happy camper! I'll be going back here very soon.",

    "text": "I want to love Condado because I love tacos.... but it's just not worth your time, ESPECIALLY when there are three stellar taco spots within walking distance. This place does not have its shit together AT ALL. I've been here twice now and both times were pretty lackluster. The first time I came with a girlfriend for happy hour. It was decent - the food is mediocre, but during happy hour it's cheap and if the service was good, I probably would have enjoyed myself more.  The second time was a straight up disaster. I went back with a large party (10 or so), also for happy hour. I don't know if they just weren't equipped to handle us or what, but from beginning to end the service was so bad. The only way to describe our server is erratic. We had issues with who ordered what, to go boxes, food prices (all on one bill to make it easier on him), a lost credit card... it was such an nightmare. As the night went on you could tell he just wanted us to leave. He cleared a nearly full margarita away from a co-worker just to get us out of there :(  To be honest... the high point of the night was actually the food runners. They were the only ones who were fast, efficient, and seemingly interested in the customer having a good experience. If they switched places with our server our experience probably would have been much better.  If the food was amazing, I'd put up with all this for sure. But don't call yourself a \"gourmet\" taco spot if you're using store-bought tortillas and guac. The guac was so obviously not freshly made. It was basically store-bought pureed avocado with no flavor whatsoever.  I guess it's still new-ish but I'm not willing to see if they work the kinks out when there are so many other better taco spots with similar prices around town. We probably won't be back.",

I went with my boyfriend and some friends and everyone was happy. I love more creative and authentic food, while my boyfriend is strictly ground beer, sour cream, and lettuce kinda guy. We both got some great tacos and left very happy.   The one and only downfall was that one of my tacos included an ingredient I didn't recognize and it turned out to be made with VERY HOT habanero peppers. The server apologized and said that the most recent batch was MUCH spicier than usual and that's not how it typically is.   The manager that was working came over and chatted with us about everything and really sealed the deal on a wonderful experience. Will definitely return to this place the next time I'm in Pittsburgh.",

The beer and liquor menus are very impressive and not too expensive. I like the atmosphere, it's 'hip' but not pretentious. However, what's lacking here is the service and management. At times it feels as though you are inconveniencing the staff.  \"Excuse me, I hate to bother you, but could I place a food order?\"  Also, they have an upstairs area with plenty of seating and a nice bar, which rarely seems open. They'd rather have the downstairs be cramped and uncomfortable, then let their patrons decide which type of atmosphere they would prefer. When it's not super packed I would say come here, but if you prefer some space and better service, go around the corner to Bakersfield. Too many good choices on the 900 block, to let service be an issue.",

It took us awhile to figure out what options we wanted on our Tacos.  Had some chips and gauc. The gauc. was a little on the sour side but still enjoyed it.  I had two tacos, one with the hard corn tortilla with chorizo and some other toppings and a flour with shrimp ceviche and some toppings.  Really enjoyed both.  Both had some nice flavors and little kick to them.  Of course your salsa and sauces options can really heat things up, but I stuck to some of the milder/medium options.  Our orders came out pretty quickly.  The system they have seems to work well. The tacos are $3 but some of the add on items do have an UP Charge.   We sat at the upstairs bar and our bartender was great.  She was really busy since it was a very crowded and noisy place.  Drinks were good too.",

    "text": "I really love the idea of another taco spot in downtown, but Condado is lacking in many areas, namely service in comparison to La Palapa(food buggy), Bea's, Tako and Bakersfield. All of these places are worth going to ahead of Condado.  I booked reservations a few weeks ago for a group of 12 work colleagues. I asked about Happy Hour specials, and the lady working mentioned that they typically don't honor Happy Hour prices upstairs, but for this large of a group they'd be able to. When we got seated at our table, our waiter would not honor Happy Hour prices until the manager approved. Note: Happy Hour specials are apparently only honored in the downstairs bar, not upstairs for a traditional visit.  We ordered an abundance of food such as chorizo queso, traditional guacamole, and pineapple salsa to start. Our waiter, was pretty awkward and unable to take simple requests, most of the night. At one point, I literally had to take my 1/3 full margarita out of his hands because he took it from the table. His goal was to get us out of there as quick as possible. We ordered a good amount of tacos, and they were pretty average. Nothing stood out to me, but several folks mentioned they were worse tasting than the first time they ate here.  Lastly, when we got our check (all on one bill), the prices were wrong several times. When I go out to eat at an establishment, I want to be in a peaceful mentality, and enjoy my experience. My experience at Condado would've been better if I threw on a Condado tee and served my own table.  Needless to say, we won't be back any time soon!",

These aren't necessarily authentic, Mexican tacos, but they are delicious. The queso, guac and salsa are all good as well. The beer menu also features a good selection of craft beers. On top of the food, the restaurant has a fun and quirky feel. It's a great place for a casual outing.",

    "text": "Condado Tacos is amazing, hands down my favorite taco joint in Pittsburgh! I've been in for dinner twice now and loved it each time. The atmosphere is laid back and the servers are super cool and friendly! The salsas, queso, and guacamole are out of this world delicious and there's plenty of chips to go around! I love the build your own taco menu and there are plenty of choices for vegetarians, too (BBQ jackfruit whattttt!!). I think both visits I got pulled pork and roasted pollo with various toppings and everything was just so good! I'm already planning what I want next time, which I hope is really soon. Btw don't let the price of the tacos fool you, they are really filling; both times I took my second taco to go!  Last but not least, the margs. Man oh man do I love margaritas and Condado hits the spot! The house is $6 and to have a flavored one is an extra $1, I'd recommend the blood orange or the prickly pear! Yum! Happy hour during the week has a half off marg special as well, I mean you cannot beat that!",

    "text": "We chose Condado as the dinner place for my husband's birthday with a couple of his friends because who doesn't love tacos?! We definitely were not disappointed. They don't take reservations so we walked in and the wait was long, but we didn't mind because there was a bar :) In fact, there are two! One downstair and one upstairs; the upstairs one seemed larger. So we left our name and went upstairs and ordered a pitcher of Strawberry Margaritas and their Traditional Jalapeno Guacamole. The pitcher served about 6 glasses and were perfect! Not to sugary or watered down like other places make, but not too strong with the taste of cheap tequila! You could taste both the mix and the alcohol = two thumbs up! The guac was great and smooth and their chips crispy. After who knows how long, we sat down and started our fun journey of building our own tacos with the check list. Two people in our party picked from their pre-selected tacos and the other four built their own. It building your own was overwhleming at first glance, but super exciting as I looked down the list. It is nice to be able to order two different tacos with two different flavor themes! I made one with the beef brisket and a spicy theme (using the other toppings) and the second one with the BBQ jackfruit (they ran out of shrimp ceviche) with a fresh theme. Both turned out AMAZING. A good taco starts from the outside and being able to get a soft AND hard shell ensures you don't miss out on any texture! All the ingedients were great and the two tacos were huge! My husband had to help me finish them! And to think... they were both under $5 each! Everyone enjoyed their food and the service was super friendly but not overbearing. The only reason I didn't give five stars is because our table was sticky, which was annoying as we were there. But, we will definitely be back. Super affordable, delicious, and convenient for all appetites!",

I highly recommend the Sweet Lucy from the taco shell selections! It is a soft shell, layered with cheese and then a hard shell inside...kind of like a gordita crunch for anyone that's a Taco Bell fan. The prices at Condado are also super reasonable. You only pay $3 per taco..unlike some other places in town that charge $6 or $7. They also have a great Happy Hour where tacos are $1 off!",

They have all types of margaritas banana, jalapeno and strawberry just to name a few. Since I had a long night ahead of me I ordered the cinco skinny margarita and some chips n salsa. Since it was super crowded they weren't using real glasses so no salt for my margarita since the salt won't stick to the cup . My margarita wasn't flavorful at all I know i removed some of the calories but this was flavorless. My chips and salsa arrived pretty quick. The chips were a lil dark for my liking and they didn't have any salt. And the salsa didn't help because it tasted like bland tomatoes. I took a glance at the menu and I liked the idea of Buliding your own taco. I may come back on a night that's not to busy to see if it's any better. Other than that this place is nothing to right home about",

There's the option to create your own tacos (many many options!) and a menu of pre-designed tacos for the indecisive people like me!  We had a group of 8 so we tried 3 different guacamole styles (regular, pineapple, and salmon) and the corn salsa, all were great and the chips were delicious. Good prices. In terms of service, our waitress brought out a plain guac instead of a pineapple guac and when we told her about it she made a face and pulled it off the table without saying a word. This is just one example where we felt we were inconveniencing the staff instead of them simply apologizing and correcting the mistake--this can really make or break a place. I was hoping our experience was just an isolated one but it seems that its fairly common here. I will probably go back because the food is good but the customer service needs to be addressed!",

After today's downtown lunchtime market, I walked my sweaty, tired self several blocks to order 5 tacos and a couple sides, for a later dinner (and next day's lunch) with my husband. I got a water and beer while I waited, and my takeout order came out pretty quickly. I asked if it was 5 vegetarian tacos and the young man said yes. I gave a quick glance into the bag to make sure it looked like my order.  after I left a tip and finished my beer, I crossed the street to wait for the bus. Rode the crowded bus home, walked up the big ass hill to my house and when I went to put the stuff in the fridge, I was bummed to see I was one taco short. Since I had been bagging and checking other people's food orders all day, I really wanted to be able to trust the Condado staff to do their jobs and check mine. And yes, I got charged for the whole order.",

After the fact she joked that \"we're supposed to tell everyone about this\".   The house margaritas are way too sweet and full of syrup. The only good thing was FAST service (and the tacos still didn't taste fresh) so we could get out of this place. Disappointing for such a prominent location.",

Any True fan of a good margarita knows it should be lime juice based.  Staff was friendly and they did have a nice mezcal selection (but no mezcal ritas).  I'd spend a little more and go to Bakersfield or Tako.  Update (7/1/18): I've been back and now love their tacos! The 1st time that I went was just after they opened, and I think that's why the food wasn't that good. Haven't gave their margaritas a second chance, but they have a great draft selection.",

    "text": "I gave it a try, but won't go back. I'll stick to Bakersfield where everything is consistently great.   1) queso: this is basically cheese soup. This is obviously something store bought and microwaved. It literally dripped off the chips. Kindof hard to eat chips and queso when the queso just runs right off.  2) tacos: I ordered my own, not the pre made suggestions. A brisket and a chicken taco. The meat was cooked at some point in the day, but wasn't even remotely warm when I got it. I guess it had just been sitting there. Other than that, not bad. Tacos are hard to mess up.  3) utensils/plates/lack thereof: I get it. You're trying to save money. But this is a taco place. Tacos are messy. You need plates if people are going to be sharing chips and queso. You can't just build a plate fort out of paper towels. Your location is downtown, so I assume you're appealing to the business crowd during lunch hours. These people wear suits and ties, etc. Come on... 4) service: in the case that you only provide paper towels, please be sure that the servers are attentive. Ours ran out at the table. I timed it for 20 minutes and nobody brought us any more. So that's the equivalent of not having a plate for 20 minutes. Also as I was leaving, the hostess was at the door and was not going to say bye. I stared her down until she said bye to me.  5) cleanliness: there was food remnants all over the floor and all over the tables...and benches... the entire time I was there. Probably because there aren't any plates or utensils, but someone could be cleaning this up... 6) \"sides\": ordered a side of rice. This came in a tiny condiment dish, with a plastic spork. It was the driest, stickiest rice ever. Basically minute rice. No flavor. Chipotle had this beat hands down.",

Stroll in to this corner spot and be transported to chic Mexico - Dia de los Muertos designed/stenciled walls; bar top tables and wooden bench booths; and a tequila lined wall behind the bar. The upstairs is roomier with another bar, so don't be alarmed by the intimate setting downstairs. Once you've settled in, it's time to play decision maker...and the options are limitless! Order some queso + housemade chips while you get your taco design on, but take heed and pace yourself! The Suggested Tacos menu will save you time and includes the El Tradicional (choice chorizo!), Surf 'N Turf (mad spicy yo!) and some solid vegetarian options such as the Dutch Dragon. Or choose your own adventure and start with your tortilla, pick your protein, and finish with toppings 'til your tickled pink. It sounds easy, but I dare you to stay focused! The options are not only extensive, but all fairly tempting. And did we mention the price?! Where else can you get a substantial, tasty taco for $3? Mas tacos, por favor!",

For starters we ordered salsa verde, salsa roja and chorizo queso. I was a big fan of the salsa roja and chorizo queso! I was debating on whether I build my own taco or order one of their creations off the menu. The build your own menu has a lot of options to pick from! I decided to build my own with the following: flour tortilla, pulled pork, pickled red onions, queso fresco and mexican chimichurri. I will say the pickled red onions and mexican chimichurri were game changers in the build your own taco challenge. The flavors really mixed nicely together with the pulled pork. I will also say that I was a little disappointed with the pulled pork to taco shell ratio. I felt like there was a lot of taco shell and not enough meat compared to what my other friends had in theirs. You really can't beat the price though! $3 for a pretty decent sized taco shell, compared to others I have had in town that are smaller and more money. I really cannot wait to come back and try one of their creations and devour more queso and salsa roja! If you love tacos and love options, this is the place for you!",

Our happy hour dreams were quickly shot down when we arrived to Condado and the hostess sat us upstairs (even though there were open seats down stairs). When I asked for the happy hour menu, our waiter informed us that we could not get happy hour upstairs. This was a bad start to our Mexican happy hour! Next time, I will make sure to tell the hostess we are there for happy hour.. hello 1/2 price margaritas!!   I still ended up ordering the muddled jalapeno margarita. This margarita was just OK for me- nothing super special about it. Chris ordered a Modelo & we also started with the chorizo queso. This queso was the best part of the meal! It was amazing & the homemade tortilla chips were just as delicious. They also gave you a generous serving of the queso and brought out more chips as needed.   I loved the idea of the create on your own tacos. I didn't know that Condado offered this and I was super excited to make my own! There are plenty of options from the meat, toppings, and shells. It made it hard to create! I had 2 tacos- the 1st was a hard shell with chicken and some different fillings (can't remember) and the 2nd was a soft shell with pulled pork, pineapple salsa and a habanero BBQ sauce. The meats were just OK and there was nothing super special about the shells. I did love the pineapple salsa though!   The atmosphere inside Condado in my opinion was great! It would be a great place to come with a group of people for tacos and margaritas! Although the food isn't as amazing as some of the other taco spots in PGH, the prices were more wallet friendly.",

She mixed up a lot and after we were specific and walked her through what each of us had she still messed up the checks. This was after having to get other servers to flag her down so we could order drinks and get water refills  Food: like I mentioned before the queso was fantastic.

I tried a variety of their options, but my favorite was easily the pulled pork with the Sweet Lucy shell ( flour soft + corn hard + queso + guac) and a side of chips with the Elote queso dip.

    "text": "Downtown is filling up with taco spots. Normally I wouldn't complain because tacos are my all time favorite food, throw in some chips/salsa/guac and a cool pitcher of margaritas and I'm in heaven. My friend and I decided to stop here on our way to the penguins game. We always feel like getting tacos before the game is good luck.  Condado is in the old Tonic space which is awesome and it truly looks great in there! The waiter explains the whole ordering processs, explains the menu, and gives up a run down of cocktails.  We proclaimed \"Pitcher of hour margaritas please\" and the waiter obliged. The pitcher came, he graciously poured our first glasses for us (it tends to spill from the pitcher sometimes). We both gave each other a look of \"oh no! These are NEON GREEN! EEEK\". The house marg tasted like what I used to make in college/late highschool. That neon green unnatural color mixer and whatever tequila was cheapest but not total shit. It was palatable but with all the insurgence of taco places downtown, it was by far the most disappointing I've had. Maybe I should have sprung for the more expensive version, I don't know. We ordered the queso diablo. Jalapenos, habenero, and onion. The queso was really good. Very smooth. The chips are made in house, which I LOVE. They were a LITTLE greasy and definitely salty (but I love salt). We even got a refil of chips to finish the queso with. So far my experience was at a 50% enjoying and liking the food and 50% that margarita was subpar. We each get 2 tacos, my friend gets a shrimp and a tofu one. I get brisket and chicken. We make our own tacos. There are SO MANY CHOICES. It's very similar to how burgatory does their build your own. I probably made some wrong choices but my tacos were \"meh\". I had my chicken one with the sweet lucy shell (seriously...it's Amazing) and i really liked that one. I was not a fan of the brisket. It had a weird flavor I just couldn't place. My friend said her tacos were \"ok, but I feel like when given the option I'm going to choose the wrong toppings and ruin my taco\".  We closed out and went on our merry way about town to the game.  I would probably hit this place for happy hour and get some appetizers, but I think the margs and tacos have a way to go.  Big props on the multiple vegan/vegetarian options though!!!",

We like to sit at the bar, but it seems like for a table, there is not much wait on weekdays (10 minutes?). I've always felt like the bartenders are friendly and talkative, even though they never stop moving! Beer/ liquor selection is unique but not intimidating. They're signature cocktails are fresh tasting, not overpowering in any department.  The food here is really the main event, though. I'm convinced that no matter what you eat here, you will not be disappointed! Fresh vegetables and house - made salsas and verdes, juicy meats, and a TON of food for the prices! I ordered the tortilla fritos with ghost pepper steak, and had enough to save for lunch the next day! And it was $7!",

    "text": "Okay, I know this probably seems like a recurring theme...but please apply the caveat \"I got steadily drunker as the evening progressed\" to the tail end of the review.  Okay...  5 stars on the accomodating staff.  Friendly.  Flexible.  We started with a group of 6...wait...sorry 8...wait...sorry...10 people for a friend's birthday party and the staff just kept finding ways to get us seating.  It is NOT their fault that the seating we ended up with was apparently a repurposed shoebox in the ass end of the top floor of the restaurant.  That was not on them.  I don't know what that space normally does...but it did hold 10.  And the restaurant was steadily busy all night.  So full marks there.  We started out the evening on the ground floor.  We ordered drinks from the menu.  They were good.  I don't...I don't REALLY remember what they were.  I'll look them up.  Bear with me.  RIGHT!  Okay...I got the Delicioso.  House Margarita, muddled jalapeno & cucumber + splash  of soda...right up my alley.  It was really good.  I probably would have ordered another one later except I thought it would be smarter to order a pitcher instead.  Related note...it is almost impossible for a single father of a younger daughter to order the Delicioso without doing so using an impression of Backpack from Dora the Explorer.  The pitcher I got was the Kahlo - Hornitos Reposado, club soda, fresh lime juice, fresh mint.  I should take a minute here to acknowledge that written underneath the margarita menu (in too small a font, if we're being fair) was, \"Keep in mind, silver tequila (used in many of our signature cocktails and margaritas) can sneak up on you. The smooth  flavor doesn't taste like alcohol, but we assure you, it's in there!\"  Heed this.    The drinks were great.  Let's give them another five stars.  The speed with which our order was taken was a downer.  I'd rank it pretty low, honestly, but they were so good about moving us around, and also...I had a pitcher of alcohol...so I wasn't really THAT irritated by it, but if I'd have been sober longer I might have been.  They were busy.  We were a big...seemingly nomadic table...so I have to give them a pass.  I'll rate that 3 stars.  I've sampled most of the elevated taco joints in Pittsburgh, so I was excited to try out theirs.  They have either a build your own menu, or a few signature styles.  I was surprised how many vegan/vegetarian options there were.  I think one of the three I got was vegetarian.  I was...I was quite drunk when the food arrived.    BUT...BUT...they were goooooood.  And that's not the tequila talking.  After my first taco, the girl across the table from me said she couldn't finish hers and passed it across and that one was even better than the one I'd ordered.    The Mantis:  Sweet Lucy shell, jackfruit, onions, tomato, Chihuahua cheese, and mango habanero sauce. Honestly ordered it because I wanted to say \"jackfruit\" over and over.   What?  I was drunk.  George's Dirty Taco:  Flour soft shell, queso blanco, rice, black beans, onions and dirty sauce This one just made me laugh.  I was eating George's dirty taco.  And laughing.  Because I'm twelve.  And I was drunk.  Surf 'n' Turf:  Flour soft shell, queso fresco, rice, ghost pepper steak,  shrimp ceviche, lettuce, onions, roja salsa, &  dirty sauce This one sounded the best to me, and I honestly don't remember whether I even ate it. I think I did though.  And it was hot.  I poured myself another drink from the pitcher.  All in all I have no idea which tacos I ate and didn't eat.  And I think the fact that I put my name on the order slip (they give you pencils and taco order forms at the table) as Rico Caliente probably contributed to the chaos that forced one of our party to just pay for the entire night on his credit card.  And I guess...I guess arms raised in victory and shouting \"WOOHOO!\" was not the correct reaction to this because everyone else seemed to be saying things like, \"Oh my god, no, you can't possibly\" and \"It's too much\" and stuff like that and frankly I was just happy to still have enough money to go to the next place, and also I was drunk.  So...I will DEFINITELY be back.  Something I didn't mention was the decor.  I loved it.  Lots of contrasting sugar skull-esque sorts of murals.  It was a fun vibe.  GREAT happy hour locale.  Really good food.  I'll...fine tune my food review in at some future date.",

They also make some of the best margarites I've had in Pittsburgh (the blood orange one is, in my opinion, in a rarefied class).  And, much to my surprise, they also have one of the best brunch menus in Pittsburgh (which is basically the taco menu with breakfast options like putting scrambled eggs in your tacos).  The build-your-own taco is inventive, and the wide variety of options makes this a decent place for groups of many sizes and composition, though it's admittedly hard to stick to certain types of \"healthy eating\" diets here.  Now that they have four locations (at the time of this writing) with proven success, I'd say the concept is ready for more rapid expansion.  I'd love to see more locations in the area, and I sincerely hope the owners can find a working model for growth without sacrificing options or quality.  There are many neighborhoods in Pittsburgh and cities in America where this would be a popular restaurant.",

Seating is available in the bar area, upstairs dinning room, and some tables set up outside that allows you to enjoy the energy of downtown and is especially great when anthrocon is in town.   The menu is tacos, guacamole and dips, and a few salads. This is not a full Mexican restaurant but what they do they really do well. They offer a wide selection of specialty tacos and a create your own tacos option. The create your own has a wide variety of options. They have several stuffed taco shells that are a soft tortilla and crunchy shell sandwiched with toppings like cheese, beans, bacon, and guacamole. I definitely suggest trying one of those options.  I had the Ju-Ju shell stuffed with chorizo and queso  and it was amazing.   Speaking of queso this place has several queso options but the Dirty Queso with chicken, beans, and the wonderful Dirty sauce (that dirty sauce should go on everything). Plus guacamole and salsa.  They also have a wide selection of Margaritas, tequilas and beer. I suggest a Margarita sampler to start but you can just dive into a pitcher if you like.   I will be back at brunch!",

    "text": "I am very torn about this 3 star rating. I was super excited to try this place because I have heard GREAT things, and I love tacos like the rest of the world, so this was a must try for me. I went with a group of 5 on a Saturday evening, and there was no trouble getting a seat. There are two floors, which is really nice. There is outside seating, but not for more than two per table due to limited space.   There are like a million different menus when you sit down, so just be sure to look at all of them. There are drink menus, taco menus, taco shell description menus, and build your own taco menus. It was a little overwhelming for me, to be honest. I decided to build my own tacos and I legit had no idea what I was doing. Our server gave us a general run down, but we were basically on our own when it came to figuring out what the proteins and toppings were.   I couldn't even tell you the toppings I put on anything because I basically just panicked, blacked out, and selected things. I only have myself to blame for the tacos I made, I know that. I picked the beef brisket and pulled pork for my proteins, and they were both ok. I did pick one of the \"fancier\" taco shell choices, and I was pretty happy with it, but I didn't know what I was getting until it came out. My friend had a shell that was like a cheesy gordita from taco bell, which seemed like a nice treat.  The decor was really cool, and I really was digging the vibe. The beer list was lengthy and they have an EXTENSIVE list for tequilas. Honestly, I just think I'm the type of person that doesn't do well with an endless amount of choices. I need a little more guidance. I will not write this place off just yet, I'm hoping to have a better experience next time!",

We started with the Queso dip. $6 and a good size serving.  The chips were very crispy and fresh.  We both ordered 3 tacos (yeah, I know!) and decided to stick with the suggestions rather than create our own (or I would have been there all day!)  I ordered the Ooey-Gooey, El  Tradicional and the El Santo.  They each were unique and tasty in their own way.  There was a nice amount of heat to each one and there were a pretty good size.   The sides come in a small cup and are really nothing to write home about (we got the rice and bacon refried beans.  Overall, we had a good experience here and will be back.

    "text": "Went here after a Penguins game in search of good, unique tacos. Got a dip trio, which comes with two salsas also. Highly recommend the chorizo queso, my dip of choice of the 5.   For drinks, my husband got the traditional Marg and I went mango. Yum, although no salt on the rim. I'm sure you could get some if you asked, but that's usually a given for a Marg.   When it came to taco time, I wanted to go with ones on the list because I often think the chef knows what meats, Vegis, and sauces pair together best for the ultimate tasty taco. Unfortunately, of the list of about 10 tacos, there was like one chicken and one beef and the rest were vegetarian or vegan friendly with no meat. I'm all for having these options, but carnivores like me want a taco with some substance. I don't know if they'd add meat to the vegan and veg options, but I opted to just create my own instead at that point. I did one with brisket and one with pulled pork. I made sure to add different Vegis, sauces, and shell choices to each so I could sample as much as I could from their list of add ons. I've gotta say, I made two pretty perfect creations. All the ingredients were fresh, my brisket one was my fav. This could be partly due to the fact that after all the dips and taco #1 I had no room for taco #2, so it went home with me and was reheated for lunch the next day.   I'd def return, and it was a nice simple walk from PPG Paints for a post-game dinner. But my only suggestion would definitely be to have more suggested tacos including meats.",

Once I finally did it came out 30 minutes into us being there because she forgot it.   We ordered chips and salsa.  Salsa was good, the top few chips were good, the rest were crushed, like inedible without a spoon crushed.    Got past that and finally got out Taco orders in.  The tacos are more like 3 stars - pretty good.  I loved the different options you can create for yourself.  Tacos are reasonable and good size portion.  I got the pork and the chicken.  Pork was way better than the chicken.  Didn't love that they didn't have traditional corn tortillas as an option, but they have other unique shell options that are reminiscent of Taco Bell (in a good way).   The menu situation is also weird, there's like 4 different menus.  I don't understand why they can't condense it to 2 menus, one to order off of and one for drinks.  I would go back to give them another shot on service and chips, but not running back.",

    "text": "Thank you Condado for offering tasty American tacos. I am part Mexican and love authentic Mexican food. However, I have a picky spouse that has the nerve to complain about said authentic Mexican and is always craving cheddar on tacos with flour tortillas. The existence of Condado has been a blessing in my life. Lol.  I stopped in with my boyfriend before a birthday party. We both got two tacos that were very filling. You can build your own and there are endless combinations! I had one steak and one pulled pork while my bf got two chicken tacos. He was sooo happy with everything and that made me extra happy. He said it was his new favorite taco place in Pittsburgh. Tacos are the world's most perfectly balanced meal and I am always more than happy to eat them. So, thank you Condado for giving me another excuse to do just that!",

Waiting area is non existent   Ok now to the good stuff. The margaritas are so good! I recommend getting a pitcher to share, it's more economical.  The guac and queso are killer and the homemade chips always crispy and perfectly salted.   The build your own taco scheme is so simple it's genius! You cant go wrong with the shells but I would recommend hard over soft. The juices from the salsas and sauces and meats will make the floor tortilla soggy.  I haven't met a meat there that wasn't good. Seriously just go. NOW!",

Hands down, probably the best tacos I've ever had. Even my boyf who isn't a foodie and hates tacos, fell in love with this place.  I always order the mantis (jackfruit taco). It's perfectly spicy and not to the level where you can't handle it. Their queso blanco is mouth-watering and their margs are great too.   Pricing is another plus. All house tacos are $3-5 each. If you create your own, it can get expensive depending on the amount of toppings you put.   It gets really crowded on weekend nights, and can be a 1 hour wait for tables of 3 or more people. However, it's a pretty small wait (sometimes none at all) for 2 people. The place is empty for brunch on Sundays, which is a great time to go.",

Not my favorite, not bad, just my least favorite of the bunch. I liked the feel of this place. It has a cool hipster taco vibe. Plus the beer selection was good. I'd go back.",

We arrived and were quickly seated at a table that was far too small for two people. We only ordered drinks, chips and tacos but they didn't fit on our table.   The service was slow and our server acted like she had better things to do. We waited over 20 minutes for our drinks and in that time we contemplated leaving. We stayed because we were so hungry and hoped anything we ordered would change our minds.   We both ordered a few tacos including the surf and turf taco which we were told wasn't ready yet because he seviche wasn't prepared. It was happy hour, so assuming it was a busy time it should have been prepared. We didn't replace it with something else and quickly ate so we could get out of there.   Maybe it was a bad day for our server or something but we wanted to love it based on the new twist it brought to tacos. We left and walked to Bakersfield down the street. We may be back if everything else is booked.",

    "text": "I'm about done with Condado, and I no longer recommend it.  After 6 experiences there (out of 8 attempts) in the last year... Positive: The tacos can be absolutely delicious, and the customize-your-own checklist format is fun.  Flip-side: At least 1/3 of the tacos we have ordered have come out not as ordered, missing ingredients requested (sometimes at additional cost), or just totally different. Sometimes meats are warm, other times cool, other times a weird stale-cooled temperature/taste. Extremely inconsistent.  The biggest negative is that, in our experiences, the restaurant doesn't prioritize customer service/ experience at all. The vibe we've caught says, \"We're popular and hip now, so you're lucky to be here, and we're just too busy and cool to have to look out for your experience.\"    First, there is often a wait, and the very strict practice of hosts refusing to give time estimates for the wait is maddening. The vibe that comes across is, \"Given how *exceptionally* busy and cool we are, the totally common practice of giving wait estimates is just too difficult in our special case.\" Yet restaurants way more hip, cool and busy somehow manage. We're grown ups; we understand that estimates are estimates. If you-- out of the experience you have with the timing, typical flow and capacity of your own restaurant, which a customer cannot possibly have--  estimate a likely wait of 10-15 minutes, and it takes 20, it's fine. Believe me, a host refusing to say whether the wait is likely around 10 minutes, or more like 45, makes a customer feel wayyyy more irate than having to wait a little longer than expected.   Tables in the downstairs are ridiculously small and cramped. The ones we've been seated at twice as a party of 4 were maybe 2.5 x 2 ft at the most, with a majority of the table space taken by the big paper towel/ menu card/ pencil dispenser. (\"You can just put that on the booth seat beside you,\" said our server.) The last time, late on a Tuesday evening, the members of my party happened to be in the mood for just water to drink instead of our usual sodas, drafts, mixed drinks. The server acted noticeably irritated with that, and from then on was brusque and rude. We proceeded to order a respectable 12 tacos to perch on our little table, but not good enough, I guess. Sorry for not making your night.",

So of course I suggested it when my family was in town because I figure - well, we all love Mexican food and guac is a universal love in our family.   However, my little bother was exhausted (cue a hangry attitude), my brothers girlfriend and one of my besties is a picky eater, and my Dad has his service dog. So I was a bit nervous I picked a place that 1. was going to be awfully crowded for a Friday evening and 2. wasn't going to satisfy a picky eater, a hangry teenage boy, and be a comfortable spot for my Dad and our service pup.   But all my nervous were most definitely appeased. We had an amazing waitress who was super helpful in navigating the menu and also making sure we were in a comfortable spot to accommodate our service dog and the the rest of us. It was a Friday in August - the place was packed, but still they made us comfortable.   The guac was incredible. The salsa was great. Both came out super quick and paired sooo beautifully with the pitcher of Blood Orange Margarita we'd ordered.   I'm a vegetarian who loves Mexican food. And this place had seriously good veg options that I was SO satisfied with. And even with a picky eater, a tired teenager, a vegetarian, and 3 others to appease, we all walked out of Condado thrilled with the experience, the food, the service.   I keep trying to find excuses and company to go back with. Whether you just wanna get buzzed off some tequila, enjoy a little snack of chips and guac (they have great specialty guac, too) or simply stuff yourself with tacos - this is the place.",

    "text": "What Stack'd does for burgers, Condado does for Tacos, and it's fantastic! Absolutely love what they did with this location; despite its prime corner location, bars in this space have traditionally struggled a bit, so I'm very happy to see this cool space move in.  Space: It's really cool inside with fantastic decorations and cramping people together bring vibrancy rather than the feeling of crowding. It's super energetic and you are infected by other happy customers munching on their tacos. Be wary to get there early during lunch though, as it gets busy FAST.  Snacks: Food concept is great. You build-your-own taco and pile it together. The meat is juicy and the bowl sizes are generous. I love that they have a variety of sauces. The chips are made in-house and the salsa is delicious.   Sips: A bunch of taps, mostly local beers, and a good variety at that. I am pleased to see more than just IPAs so super good :)  Service: It's fairly fast for a local scratch location, but it's a bit slow if you are considering that they are only making tacos. Keep in mind, yes, really busy around lunchtime. Servers are friendly and very good about clearing your tables quickly to make up for the small tables and amount of space you have. Kudos to you.  Been there twice already this month, will be back soon",

    "text": "I have frequented Condado for the past year or so and I can definitely say they have amazing tacos. The margs are good--the house marg and the blackberry marg are my personal favorites. Service is usually pretty quick. Happy hours on Thursday and Friday can get pretty busy, so you may have to wait 15-20 minutes or so on those evenings. The consistency of the margaritas used to be iffy, as in the first marg would be normal or strong and then the second would be weaker. This hasn't happened in a good few months, though. I would highly recommend this place to everyone.",

    "text": "I've been to Condado a few times now with friends to catch up and enjoy a nice happy hour. The tacos are about $2/each during happy hour and margs are about $4. (Mon-Fri 5-7) I'm not a huge margarita fan, but I will drink all of the margs at Condado! They're so refreshing and not too sweet usually. They also have seasonal flavors which is always fun.  As far as their tacos go, they're quick and easy tacos that aren't expensive and are MTO, or you can order from their pre-made options. There are SO many choices from gluten-free to vegan friendly. I also know that the chips and dips are gluten-free, so eat up! Last time I stopped here, my friend and I actually just ate their endless chips with a dip flight and it was enough! I HIGHLY recommend their queso blanco - YUM!  I'm sure it's been mentioned and tipped a million times, but downstairs Condado is not a big area. Happy hour specials are only available downstairs, not in their upstairs area (which I've never actually been to). Expect it to be crowded on game nights and during the week during happy hour. I haven't had trouble sitting the few times I've stopped here, but it does get cramped. In the summer they do have outdoor seating.  Overall, it's an easy place to go to enjoy an affordable happy hour with friends in a pretty cool environment. The staff isn't super attentive, but they're usually super nice and also, how much could you really need other than margs and tacos?! It's not really a deal breaker. Pro tip - get a margs flight and a few tacos so you don't need your server until you're finished! :)  P.S. I'm super bummed that cashback on Yelp isn't available here anymore!",

    "text": "I went to the location on 9th around 7pm and the place was so loud it was too loud.  We ordered 3 different tacos but they all had just too many ingredients and they were just piles of jalapenos no real way to even taste anything just a burnt mouth and soggy experience. One was covered in a red sauce that ruined the taste of all the other ingredients too overpowering.  I think maybe building my own Would have been better but I trusted the custom creations.  I guess big mistake.  In the end we paid almost 50 with tip for some street tacos that were so hot they were inedible.  One was basically a Taco Bell crunch wrap supreme.  I felt suckered leaving the place but this is how these places are with super high rent and trendy locations.  I'd imagine this building will be 10 different things in the next few years.   On a positive note the guacamole was good.  Little watery and spicy but it was tasty.  That's probably the only positive I could give this place.",

I loved that I could customize even the basic of ingredients (like orange cheddar) into a creation of mine, and they all tasted great.

They are organized when working with high volumes and I like that they have an automated text system for when it's time for you to get your table. My food this past time was pretty sloppy and seemed a little thrown together due to how insanely crowded it was during Anthrocon, but the taste made up for it. I love the amount of vegan and vegetarian options and it's great how customizable the food is, making it a great place to bring nearly anyone regardless of their diet!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try this place for a year but never had the chance to. Every time I tried to go, plans always changed. However, last night was my birthday and was determinedly make my first visit.   When we arrived, the hostess asked if we wanted a table or to sit at the bar, which we like to do. She informed us that there was another bar upstairs. When we went upstairs, the bartender informed us the upstairs bar would be closing soon. I looked around, saw full tables and an almost full bar and said to my girlfriend, \"why would you say that to customers\". Regardless we went back downstairs and decided to wait for a table.   We overheard the hostess tell the group in front of us that their food supply delivery truck was in an accident and they were out of a lot of key ingredients. I asked the hostess to confirm what I had overheard, but decided to be seated since we were already there. I figured we could a least have a drink and discuss plan b.   Once seated, the server (wish I saved receipt so I could use her name) quickly approached us and asked what we would like to drink. I had my heart set on a Kahlo, but she informed me they were out of mint. At this point I ordered a go to Beer and then asked if they had the stuff to make the Tuscan guacamole, which was another item I had planned on ordering when previewing their menu the prior day. She informed me they were missing the top cheese for the item but could do the pineapple guacamole. We order that and I discussed with my girlfriend having the guacamole, finishing our drinks and going somewhere else because I didn't want my first time there to be marred with something out of their control.   The guacamole came out almost instantly and it was very good. I asked the server what ingredients they were out of and she \"x'd\" and marked things on both the build your own and regular menus. She knew exactly what was what and was able to answer all my questions. I looked at it and discussed with my girlfriend that we can make this work, let's just stay here.   We both built our own tacos they way we would've wanted them and put our order in when our server refilled out 1/2 empty tortilla chip basket without us even asking ++++.   The tacos came out fast, almost to fast, that I'd advise anyone to wait until the moment you are actually ready to eat before ordering. Haha  The room was a little tight but our food and drinks (we had a couple specialty margaritas as well) were great. However our server was phenomenal! She made what could've been an unpleasant experience for a late night birthday dinner (when other restaurants were closing limiting plan b options) one that I am taking the time to write about this morning.   In this day of saturated dining options, Condado Tacos stands among some of the top in the taco/Mexican restaurant explosion in Pittsburgh. I will definitely be returning.",

As a vegetarian, it can sometimes be difficult to find good variety at restaurants, but I've been here a couple of times, haven't ordered the same thing twice, and have loved everything I tried. The queso and guacamole both rank easily among the best I've had, the tofu and jackfruit are well-seasoned and perfectly cooked, and the margaritas and horchata are killer.

Very prompt and a great sense of humor. The music was being played off someone's playlist - which normally could be a nightmare but made it really fun to vibe to.   Now the reason for the 4 stars instead of 5....the menus. I won't beat a dead horse based on the other reviews but yes, there are about 10 different menus and it was confusing as hell. I had to proactively ask what I needed to do to order properly as it wasn't really explained to us. Definitely overwhelming for anyone who has a hard time making choices.  That being said, the food was some of the best I've ever had. We got regular queso which had just enough spice/flavoring to it. The chips are freshly baked every day and were delicious. I ordered a hard shell corn taco with pulled brisket and a goody-goody soft shell with chicken. Both were AMAZING. The brisket was almost sweet, something that perfectly complimented the saltiness of the meat. The goody-goody came with 'crunch'....i dont know what the 'crunch' was made out of (neither did the waiter) but it gave a perfect amount of spice and texture to the taco. The chicken was incredibly moist and yummy. The side of black beans were the most flavorful plain black beans I've ever had. I don't even know how that happens.  The best part was the tacos were full size (not that tapas $5 for a scrap of meat crap) and at $3-6, you can't beat the price for the quality of food.  All-in-all, don't be scared to try this place bc of the menus. Explore, try new things, ask questions. It's far too delicious and inexpensive not to!",

    "text": "Service is very fast during lunch as it hasn't been very crowded the couple of times I've gone for lunch.   I am seeing some negative reviews from Cinco de Mayo recently - yes, that was a train wreck. People were not relinquishing their tables for hours after paying (note to the public, even on a normal day, if a restaurant is packed and people are waiting and you paid your bill thirty minutes ago - leave. Seriously. The problematic Cinco de Mayo was largely because of inconsiderate guests in my opinion). Granted, when we finally sat down, the waiter was rather rude when I said we had more people but I suggested that when the people who finished next to us left (ie one of the aforementioned parties who paid their bill and did not leave) then they would come and sit there, but he then told them to take their time to spite me. After that his crass and vulgar service was more for comedic effect but it initially was not appreciated. I imagine it was the busy day that had everyone on edge.  Otherwise, the tacos are great. Good size, and I love their combo of soft and hard, held together with cheese. Yum. You can build your own or go for premade combos. I would recommend trying out the jackfruit as as meat substitute - very similar to pulled pork in texture but with a sweet tanginess that adds dimension to the taco.    A large variety of margarita flavors is fun for happy hour. I like the prickly pear flavor best.",

I ordered one of the signature tacos, Bubba Kush (a bit more fruity than I was expecting, and a customized taco. The Bubba Kush came with two taco shells -- one hard shell and one soft shell, and it is a miracle in every bite.   We also got chips with the Guac of the Month -- Caramelized Apple Guac, which was no mistake it all. We were both very impressed by the sweet and savory taste. The combination of the caramalized apples and guac were unexpectedly compatible. They also provide unlimited chips with your choice of dip (who can resist that!!!).",

There is so much variety which makes it really fun and REALLY tasty.  For two tacos and all that I put in it I expected it to be a little more filled, but that's okay!

    "text": "Spicy!!! They need a spice warning for some of these tacos!  Anyway, I was a bit disappointed by my experience here. It was extremely crowded and very loud. You are either going to be crammed in downstairs, or crammed in upstairs. They don't really have menus, you use two different sheets of paper to order by checking what you want in pencil. The first sheet has \"suggested\" tacos and the other sheet is a \"create your own\". I decided to get two suggested tacos. You put your name at the top when you are done filling out your sheet.  At the table they give you plastic sporks and a roll of paper towels. So messy. The cafeteria style sporks just don't work and feel really cheap to me. Can't invest in some real forks? When it was time to deliver the tacos, the waiter would announce the name and you claim your tacos from the tray. When our table got the tacos, we were all confused about who actually had the right tacos. Mine ended up having meat in it, but nobody at the table ordered meat. Apparently I did by accident. There was a spanish word in the description that I did not understand that apparently meant meat. It was a %#*^ show.   The waiter returned with two new tacos, the Dutch Dragon and George's Dirty Taco. I took one bite of the dutch dragon, and my mouth turned to complete fire. It had guac, portobellos, corn, tomatoes, salsa and of course pickled jalapenos. Again, probably my fault, but they really need a spicy warning. I scarfed down the dirty taco, which seemed spicy too, but maybe it was because my mouth was burning. That one had rice, beans, cheese, onions and \"dirty sauce\". I literally don't know what that means but it was a decent taco.   So, if you want absolute chaos and a night ending with sticky fingers and a burning mouth, come on down!",

We first started off with the El Tres Amigos - which was a sampler of their dips. We ordered the salsa roja, Diablo queso, and the traditional guacamole. Since the salsa roja is like their \"house salsa\", our waitress asked us to choose one more to try & so we got the ghost pepper roja salsa! All 4 were so delicious. Although a couple were described as spicy, they weren't overwhelming to me. I chose to build my own tacos and ordered two. It was the perfect amount! They did have a list of tacos that were already made but I chose to make my own. Since we were there for happy hour, I decided to have a couple mango margaritas. It was very sweet & delicious!

My friends and I visit this place fairly often for lunch and they're pretty good at getting us in and out during our allotted lunch hour.  The happy hour is good too! Lots of interesting drinks at a decent enough price.",

I really loved the \"sweet Lucy shell\" which is essentially a hard taco shell wrapped in a soft shell. The steak nachos were also amazing and could basically be a meal if you're not insanely hungry. Everything was cooked very well and the combination of flavors on my tacos was incredibly unique and unlike I've had anywhere else. I had a Peach Margarita and (like the food) it was delicious.   The decor is also very cool and Condado is in an accessible location downtown. I will definitely be returning",

The service was great and our server took a lot of time to explain all of the options and some of his favorites with us.  We had the queso blanco and salsa verde to start.  The queso might be the best I have ever had.  It was a perfect level of thickness and had a great cheesy taste.  The salsa was also very good.  It wasn't runny like many salsas can be.  The chips they use are house made and you can definitely notice a difference.  I had two soft shell flour tacos as my meal.  My first was the house made chorizo with cheddar and Mexican chimichurri.  The flavor of the chimichurri was great and went perfect with the chorizo.  My second taco was the chicken with chipotle crema.  The chipotle sauce had a perfect amount of spice to it.    Overall I couldn't have been happier with the food here.  You can tell everything is fresh and house made which really makes a difference.  Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Great taco place in downtown Pittsburgh area. We were a party of 8 with no reservations on a busy Saturday night, and I think we ended up waiting 20-30 mins to be seated.   Our whole group was vegetarians, so it was awesome to have a place where you can fully customize all the tacos. That can also be a potential downfall because there are so many choices! Lol it took us a while to fill out all the little forms, and we had to make several adjustments, but our server was great and had everything down. My only complaint is that it took a long time for our tacos to come out (~40 mins).   We started with some dips at $7 each: 2 guacamole and 2 queso with black beans - both were delicious! I ordered 3 tacos for myself (avg of $3.50 each) and ended up not eating one full taco as the size is pretty big. My favorite was the Mantis, which was sweet/savory/spicy! They also have a nacho option as a main, which was a hit with my parents.   Highly recommend!",

We got the pineapple guac - which basically seemed like regular guac with some pineapple on top. It was decent but I would probably get the traditional one next time. As for tacos, I got 2 and they were more than enough. They sure put a lot in there! I got the surf n' turf and wow, it was so good. Now, I am very proud of my spice tolerance but the dirty sauce really packs a punch. For my second taco, I decided to build my own: peezler tortilla (there's stuff in between the two different shells!), their house-made chorizo with the cabbage slaw and the taco sauce. I thoroughly enjoyed both tacos but if I had to pick which one I liked better, I'd go with the surf n' turf. I've always been a shrimp gal.   We also got a few drinks - I got the bubbles + blush, which was not bad but also not great either.  The service was decent. We found that we had to flag down our waiter to get more drinks and for the check.",

The review is more like 3.5 but I rounded up because the food is soo good.  My most recent experience was kind of unfavorable. I decided to bring my two friends who had never been there. Our waitress, Amy, greeted us promptly which was great and asked us if we had ever been there before. I explained that I had but my friends had not. When one of my friends submitted her order (which is on a sheet somewhat like a scantron) the waitress kind of scolded her for filling it out incorrectly. She left the table as if she didn't have the time of day. After I explained how to fill the form out...our waitress collected our forms and sent them to the kitchen. But that's pretty much all we heard from her until she delivered our check.  The food came out super quick and we all agreed our food was great. The food runner was super nice. 3 for $10 tacos is appropriate for what you get and the tacos are a dollar off during happy hour.  So yeah. Food on A1, service not so much.",

Even though we got a flight, the bartender muddled the jalapeno and mixed the other flavors in front of us. They weren't premade.   I would definitely recommend a flight over a single margarita, I think you get more bang for your buck through a flight.  We also ordered a build your own taco which was delicious. I would recommend the shrimp ceviche.",

Our waitress was helpful and quickly walked us through the ordering process.   We ordered the queso with corn to start. It was only $7, which I did not think was too pricey. The queso came out very quickly, and the chips were delicious. I ordered the Mantis taco with jackfruit, and I created my own taco on a flour tortilla with the tofu as my protein. I was slightly disappointed by the flavor of the tacos. The sweetness of the tofu did not pair well with any of the toppings in my opinion. The sweet Lucy shell with guac and queso was very good, and I liked the chipotle crema. I was not a fan of the mango habanero sauce. The rest of the toppings were slightly disappointing to me. I was also missing soft corn tortillas, which to me are the best shells for tacos.   I would like to give Condado another chance and will likely be back for happy hour. I have yet to try the margaritas. The prices made the food worth it to me and redeemed Condado a little bit in my eyes. For 2 tacos and some queso split with a friend, my bill totaled under $12. You will definitely get a good bang for your buck here, but if you're looking for a bit more of an upscale dining experience, I would recommend Bakersfield. Condado rivals more closely with Mad Mex in my opinion.   One more thing: Condado uses plastic sporks and lines plastic baskets with thin parchment paper. At an eat-in restaurant like this, I was disappointed to see so much disposable dinnerware. I hope they will soon move toward reusable plates and silverware.",

I wasn't feelin' Condado on my first time, so I thought to give it another chance for their happy hour.  If it is your first time, no worries because the staff is very friendly and will walk you through how to order!  TACOS (~$3.50ea): Varies in prices depending on shell type or protein. This place is by no means authentic, and you could probably go way wrong with building your own taco. There are also pre-set tacos you could choose for those indecisive folks. GUAC: Get guac if you have at least 2 people. It was quite a bit for me and the boyfriend that we took it to go and then I forgot it at the nearby Millies.. HAPPY HOUR (weekdays 5-7PM): is really a great deal. Half off margaritas and dollar off tacos! Probably one of the better deals in the area. However, our margs tasted pretty watery, but being half off ($3.50?), it was aite. Maybe we weren't so lucky that day.  Cool vibes and decent tacos. A solid happy hour spot.",

    "text": "** Cool interior paintings and solid happy hour deals, but unfortunately the food wasn't anything too special. Definitely not the best taco joint or option in town, but could be a good place for happy hours (5-7 pm).  I probably would choose Bakersfield over Condado in terms of the tacos, but Condado seems like a cool spot to get drinks and appetizers with some buddies after going around downtown. The tacos were $1 off and the drinks were also half off for happy hour, which honestly might be a better deal than Bakersfield (though not 100% sure). My girlfriend and I definitely took advantage of this deal, also ordering an appetizer of guac to go with the complementary chips.  The guac was definitely a very generous portion, and we had plenty left to take home. This could be a nice happy hour option with a group of coworkers or friends, since you could definitely split the large appetizer of guac and just order discounted drinks. The ambiance seemed fairly vibrant, with colorful paintings / decorations on the wall.  Not like anything was really wrong with the tacos or food here, but it just turned out pretty mediocre and didn't taste authentic at all. There are lot of options to choose from in the build your own menu to customize it the way you like, or you can choose preset options. If anything, I might get one or two just to snack on, but wouldn't want to rely on this as a primary dinner option to get full off. Typically, I do say I eat a lot but I probably wouldn't order any more than two tacos here.",

    "text": "Condado Tacos is one of my favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh and my girlfriend can definitely attest to this as I always suggest Condado whenever we decide to go out. Everything from the environment to the amazing murals on the walls really come together nicely to please any hungry stomach.   Although the place can get very loud at times due to the somewhat cramped seating arrangement, this means that the wait for tables is usually very short. This is the only reason I'm not giving 4 stars. The wait staff and bartenders are always very nice and willing to help out with any request you may have whether its just a recommendation or something more. They are open 11am-2am every day which is good for grabbing a late night snack.   The food is what keeps me coming back though. The ability to make your own taco is always a cool option but it can get a little pricey if you start to get too creative. I personally go with the specialty tacos since they offer a wide variety and they will almost always be cheaper that a build-it-yourself taco. The bubba kush taco is my personal favorite and it packed full of ingredients, two of these will have you feeling bloated. Make sure you wash it down with a margarita as they definitely don't hold back on the tequila and you will always get your moneys worth. A margarita pitcher is a good causal drink for 4 or a tipsy split for 2! If you like whiskey you will feel right at home here as their bar is basically a whiskey bar and they offer around 50 different varieties of whiskey. During happy hour they offer half off margs from 4-7pm (times might vary since I've been there).   If you haven't been to Condado yet, you need to give it a try. I promise you will walk away with a full stomach and new favorite taco place!",

    "text": "We've been to this location a handful of times since the opening. We first discovered Condado in Columbus, OH and were pretty excited when we saw it in Pittsburgh.   Condado is a great taco joint where you can either order off their menu or build your own tacos. We usually chose to build our own! There are multiple shells to pick from, as well as meat, cheeses, veggies, etc.   I usually order a side of rice with my taco (one because we fill up on chips and queso, so I can't eat more than one!), and they used to come in the little 2 oz dressing cups. (You pay $1 for a side of rice) They more than doubled that size when we went on Friday, so that's a plus! The restaurant was really busy when we got there, and we waited about 20 minutes for a table. Once we ordered, our chips and queso, as well as our tacos, came out super fast! I usually order the roasted chicken or chorizo. I love their chorizo because it's really flavorful without being overly spicy.   I only have two complaints about Friday's particular visit (and this doesn't happen every time!) - my taco didn't have all of my selected toppings (I love my pickled onions, and they were left out), and we waited more than 15 minutes for our check. Our server did bring us a full bag of chips to take on the go since we asked for one for our remaining chips, so that's a plus  Still one of my favorite stops if we're downtown!",

    "text": "I love Condado! It's one of my favorite places to get tacos in the city. While it's not super authentic, their quality and tastes are superb. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because I think their other location nearby in Lawrenceville is a lot better (in regards to set up, speed of service, etc).   This location is in downtown, near the convention center and many other restaurants. While they are open late, that doesn't mean they won't be constantly busy. It's incredibly tightly packed and loud. There are two floors in this location. Unless you're sat on the top floor, you won't be able to hear your group over the music and the guests.   Loudness aside, I think everything is awesome. Their food is fantastic, drinks are strong, and I am obsessed with the chips and blanco queso. I recommend coming in for happy hour because it makes the already cheap food even cheaper, and who doesn't love a good margarita?  Writing this review makes me want to go back!",

    "text": "Good drinks and easy fill-out-a-sheet ordering process. They always seem to be making slight tweaks to their menu and have ample options for vegans and vegetarians. I also appreciate the way that the menu makes simple out of a very long list of options of not just food combinations but also ways to enjoy (bowl, hard shell, soft shell, hard shell and soft shell, etc.).  You want shareables? The guac, queso, and salsas are excellent for the undecided orderer holding up your party.  You want to do something crazy? The menu's radio buttons of choices allow you to do whatever you want, like an every-kind-of-cheese hard-shell taco with jalapenos. Whatever, you do you.  My favorite thing to do at made-to-order gas stations is close my eyes and press buttons, so I try to emulate that behavior as much as possible whenever I go to Condado. The only difference is now I can randomly roll for tacos with a margarita in hand. Upgrade.",

I can't remember the name of the one I ordered off the menu but it had portabella mushrooms and was delicious.  I got there around 4:30 on a Monday and stayed until almost 6.

My friend and I went before happy hour around 4:30. We were seated right away and the waiter was really sweet. He indulged my friend in taste testing a beer without a second glance and also steered us towards a really good chip, queso, and salsa combo. I appreciate the time he took with us, especially since we ordered only chips and two beers. Very good service.   We chose two quesos: the spicy one and the one with corn. I would say the spicy one was for sure a hit. The corn was good, but didn't have enough corn or spice to make it super exciting. I would have preferred the plain corn salsa I think, without the cheese (blasphemous, I know).  We also picked the plain guacamole. I think next time we will up our game and do the spicy. While it had a good flavor, I think we were looking for more of a kick.   I had a great time. I look forward to coming back and maybe eating more of the \"real food\" options on the menu!",

My go-to is the Sweet Lucy shell with tofu for protein and nearly all of the toppings. Important tip--the chips are free but you have to ask for them!   Also, the place is almost always packed and seating is limited so it's not the best place for large parties. The first floor is also extremely dim lit and loud.",

As she is the first person you see, we feel that this gave a negative feeling to the experience. Also, she complained multiple times when we were eating and she complained with another coworker. This needs to be corrected by management as this is makes the restaurant not as pleasant. Aside from that, everything was great with both our servers being nice and attentive.",

I believe I've had this girl before and received proper service from her in the past, so I'll just chalk it up to a long day.

I'm sure I'm in the minority in this way of thinking, but based on the commitment to fresh ingredients alone, I would seriously love to try a chef inspired dish there, maybe it exists, and I just didn't see it.

    "text": "One of the new wave of hipster, \"upscale\" taco joints in downtown Pittsburgh.  Not very impressed.  I've eaten here twice and tried a variety of menu items. Ordering is overly complex, but does allow for extreme customization (although there are $1-$2 surcharges for many of the sections of options, so you could easily end up paying $12 for one taco).  Do not order the Chronic Tortilla Fritos (Ghost Pepper Steak nachos).  $7 and I counted 5 tiny bites of (bland) steak.  Mainly just a mound of cheese and lettuce.  And not spicy at all.  The dish makes me seriously question how much of the place is a marketing gimmick vs genuine restaurant.  I also ordered some rice as a side- $1 extra.  A small condiment sized container of possibly the most bland and clumpy white rice I've ever had (think of some high school cafeteria).  Very overpriced and disappointing.  Pass on that too  The El Santo was the favorite taco I tried and I'd rate it 7.5/10.  It was also the favorite taco of rest of my group.  The Good: -Plenty of seating (unlike Tako which is crammed and rude and almost always pretentiously \"booked\") -Prices are generally good. $4-$5 for a taco that is twice the size of most places (2 tacos should fill up nearly everyone).  $5 for most beers   The Bad: -Happy hour ONLY available in cramped downstairs while upstairs sits empty -No chefs specials or drink specials (even the flavors of month are nothing more than naming gimmicks as the ingredients and flavors do not appear to be truly altered within the actual food) -A la carte surcharges -Bland sides, especially white rice -Majority of taco options are bland and ordinary (despite the clever, misleading names)  Overall Condado Taco is an average taco place with above average prices.  They appear to have avant-garde flavors and combinations but in reality there is nothing differentiating.  Not overtly friendly but still much more appealing than the pretentious Tako.   Probably the best trade off between price, value, flavor, and friendliness of all the new wave taco spots in downtown Pittsburgh, although unfortunately the bar isn't all that high.",

Their menu is quite interesting that allow you to chose quantity of the taco you want or build your own. There are not many suggested taco to chose from speak as a first time visiter. There are multiple vegan options as well which is pretty nice compare to a lot of place only offer one or two options for vegetarians. It is a little pricy for a workday lunch. It would definitely cost $10+ for lunch without tax and tips. The portion is bigger than a lot of taco offer in town. I ordered three tacos but full after 1 1/2. The mantis, surf'n turf and el santo were the ones I got. Love them all besides the surf'n turf because it was way too spicy! I wish the bartender would mention the host pepper is really included in the taco and it is very spicy. Had to stop after one bite. But one thing I like a lot about this place is they process things very fast. From the time that I turned in my order till they brought out my tacos, I would say 5-10 minutes? All their staff were very nice as well!",

Meat had great flavor and the shell tasted home made.   The next 2 were chicken a soft shell. Chicken was very bland and nothing special about the shell.   Side of rice was a tiny little serving for $1.  It was like the size of a golf ball. The rice was also not that good.  I was hoping for a cilantro lime type of rice. This was just white rice with very light seasoning...was expecting more.   So all in all, food wasn't terrible just not great.   I went during lunch on a Monday so I can't judge the atmosphere. They did a pretty good job remodeling prior restarting that was there but not a lot of people and music was very quiet so can't judge atmosphere or drink selection.   I'll go back for sure one day and give it another try.",

It's like the Burgatory of Taco Places - get a notepad and pencil, and start building your own tacos. The amount of options to choose from are INSANE! However - I really love their BBQ jackfruit.   They are also surprisingly fast at serving up your food, no matter how busy it is. I work at the Convention Center, and have gone during the lunch rush for a To Go order, and only had to wait 15 min. I have gone on a dead Saturday, and waited like 5min. This is amazing, if you only get a 30min lunch break.   The staff has always been super nice and helpful, and the decor is also fun and funky to look at. Maybe there is a bit of inspiration from Mad Mex's decor...? Either way - it's always fun to look at colorful skulls and cartoonish characters when eating Mexican.   I need to bring other people here; but since I come for my lunch break, I haven't had the beauty of sharing this place yet. They do have a loyalty program; and they are also involved in Yelp's cashback program. Overall - 5 stars because they win for having MULTIPLE veggie options, their staff is super great, and it's bright and fun inside. Not many other places in Downtown can boast that.",

Check this place out and ask to sit upstairs if you think the ground floor is too packed.  ** Updated May 2018  I'm removing two stars due to the service consistently being awful. I no longer frequent Condado like I once did. I'm back at Bakersfield slamming back the PBRs and guacamole.

It's perfect for the after-work crowd to have some cocktails and some excellent tacos. Luckily, we were able to be seated upstairs with no problem.  We started our meal with a couple of drinks. For the four of us, a couple of the drinks were hit or miss. For instance, my Modelo-Ritas were perfect, but one of our group had trouble tasting any gin in his Ghost Gin and Tonic.   We then ordered probably one of the best queso I have ever had: Condado's Dirty Queso (chicken, black bean, onion, and dirty sauce) served with really good chips. We then ordered the Chorizo Queso, and while it was good, it was not as good as the Dirty Queso we had just had.  Order made-to-order tacos were perfect. I ordered shrimp ceviche on a flour tortilla with onions, and cilantro and it was excellent. My other two tacos were chicken (with a wonderful smoke to it) on flour tortillas with smoked cheddar and salsa roja.  The service was excellent and the prices fair.  Give this place a try. I do not think you'll be disappointed.",

First, their menu is full of Taco Bell versions of Mexican food where there are no classic options, and all tacos are odd inventions like \"crunchy corn tortilla inside soft flour tortilla with sour cream in between\". Their brisket was painful to eat. It tasted like greasy boiled beef (I.e., tasteless). Their home made chorizo tasted like they emptied a can of seasoning on ground meat. Their guacamole is by no means made from fresh avocados; it tastes like grocery store liquid guac that they \"spice up\" by adding chopped tomatoes and a lot of jalapenos, because \"if you can't make it tasty, make it spicy\". Probably the worst food I have had in Pittsburgh in 5 years. We couldn't even finish it.",

    "text": "Went to check this out during their official opening night with a friend of mine. Will definitely be giving it another shot in the hope that they were just working out the kinks in the new location.   To start, the downstairs packed a lot of tables in a small space, so I was constantly having to move my seat in to let the wait staff go by. I can deal with that, but after the 15th time or so, it did get old.   The waitstaff was very nice here, but seemed like maybe they were overwhelmed. There were multiple occasions during the night where we were either brought the wrong item, or it was forgotten completely.   The drinks were good (even though they were out of the muddled Jalapeno margarita I was hoping to try). Although another table and ourselves did notice that the wait staff doesn't ask if you want salt on the rim of the margarita you order, which is a bit odd.   I enjoyed the appetizer trio they offered, as you could choose from a few varieties of salsa, queso, and guac. The chips they gave with it were very good, but about 75% of them were crumbs that were barely big enough to dip. Luckily the wait staff offered to replace the chips a couple times as they noticed it was mostly crumbs also.   Now when it comes to tacos, I think my bar has been set pretty high by places in Pittsburgh like Bakersfield downtown, and Doce Taqueria in southside, so I was a little disappointed with the Tacos here. The tacos weren't bad by any means, but definitely not what I was hoping for.",

    "text": "It seems like DIY food is in right now, from burgers to pizza to burritos (as exmplified by Chipotle), so why not tacos? You choose everything from the shell to the meats to the veggies and cheese, so you can be sure to fully enjoy what you get. Or if you're not creative like me, you can just go with some of the suggestions, most of which sound pretty innovative already. They have both corn and flour shells, and various creative combinations of combining them. Lots of interesting vegetarian options for proteins as well, such as jicama and jackfruit, and a large number of different sauces to choose from. I chose to sample four different suggested tacos with a variety of ingredients, and each one was bursting with different flavors from sweet to spicy to savory. They were definitely filled with toppings, since finishing all four was a bit of a struggle. The only thing I would be wary of is that they tend to splurge on the sauces--some of them were dripping as I ate them. I would ask for them to go a bit lighter next time, or try to build my own to control that a bit better.   Their salsas are also worth mentioning--really fresh and a great appetizer to share around the table.",

For every 5 whiskeys or tequilas My group and I tried to order they were out of 4 of them which was a bit frustrating. Also, the next day we went back for lunch and again the food was great but the bartender that helped us was not very friendly. I would recommend going for the food and drink options for sure and hopefully they get a shipment in soon!",

We had a party of 5 and 4 of us got exactly what we ordered.  The one who didn't had his lunch comped by the manager so he didn't mind.  Returned for Happy Hour on Cinco de Mayo.  Tough to beat 1/2 price margaritas so it was no surprise that they were packed, especially that day.  They claim to have over 30,000 combinations.  It will take me a while to try them all but I will make an effort.  The queso was very good and so were the chips, but they tend to flake easily so you are left with a basket of crumbles.  Tried the chorizo and the brisket tacos.  Both were good, not great.  If you try something and don't like it, then you have plenty of choices for the next visit.  The menu gives you an idea on the heat of the salsa so you can dial it up as hot as you want it.  Maybe next time I will try the ghost pepper sauce.  Hopefully they will get their service issues worked out shortly.",

We ended up hitting up Condado Tacos at around 11:00pm on a Saturday night after the Cubs Pirates game and the place was packed. Drinks were very good. Tacos were good but one of mine had a bit too much sour cream. Its a pretty cool concept for a Mexican/taco joint, almost like ordering off a sushi menu. There are paper menu tickets and pencils at every table and you just mark of the taco you want and how many or you can mark off custom taco by checking individual ingredient boxes, example, type of tortilla, type of meat/protein, type of cheese, types of vegies, etc. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for some good tacos, they have many traditional as well as unique taco offerings.",

    "text": "Condado is okay, but it's trying really hard to be Tako.   We were there at about 8pm last night and it was super loud and clubby, which okay, that's their vibe, but it was a Wednesday night at 8pm.  It's just a hugely jarring change from Tonic, the establishment in the same location before.  It was also very dark, which made it really hard to read the menus that are printed in teeny tiny font.    My husband and I have three advanced degrees between us and we genuinely couldn't figure out how to order the tacos - it's one of those papers where you check the things you want, but it's really unclear how it works and how you order - go online and look at their menu and you'll see what I mean.  I couldn't even figure out where the nachos were  (under \"tortillas,\" listed as \"tortillas fritas\" in like 4 point font - not the first place I'd look to find nachos).    The tacos came and they were good.  Not fantastic but solid.  The nachos came and were *so incredibly annoying.*  It was enough nachos to fill a big platter, as nachos are typically served, but they were piled 8 inches high into a tiny little basket.  Picking up just one made a huge mess, and about 10 nachos in, we just gave up because food was going everywhere.    On the positive side, the staff were very friendly and the decor (think many, many skulls) is pretty cool.  More tacos in my mouth is always a good thing, but I think Bakersfield, about 100 feet away, is a more solid choice.",

    "text": "I had friends in from out of town and thought it was the perfect chance to try Condado.  While driving from the Latrobe airport, i called at 7:15pm and asked for a reservation for 8pm.  I was told on the phone that a reservation wasn't needed and we could easily walk in for a table.  I told them we had 4 people and they assured me it would be no problem to get a seat at 8pm.  So..I get downtown, pay to park my car, we walk three blocks and reach Condado to find it's completely packed.  The hostess told us we had to wait and there were three parties ahead of us - not sure how long the wait was.  There was no room at the bar to stand or any room upstairs.  We awkwardly stood around, often in the way of the wait staff and other patrons standing around waiting for a table. We could see empty tables around and more that were being cleaned so we hoped it wouldn't be long.  8:30pm comes around and we were still waiting.  The empty tables we saw were being filled and more people we waiting.  I went to the hostess station to ask what the deal was and was told that \"There's 2 parties in front of you..\".  Over the course of 30 minutes the only seated one party?  Not buying that.  My friends and I were hungry so we left.  Before I left I chatted with a guy at the bar who was leaving as well - told me he ordered his food and waited 35 minutes but they lost his order and he never got it.  I hoped after being open for a month they would work out any kinks they might have.  If I would have wandered in at 8pm and had this experience that's one thing - but not taking a reservation and having your patrons waste their time is another.  Why not take a reservation, it's guaranteed business?    I can't comment on the food, but the decor was cool i guess.  I hope other ppl get better customer service than I received.",

I found the concept refreshing, but the execution a little flawed. Condado is a make your own taco joint, but also has a set list of menu tacos. They have several protein options, and  many vegetarian options, which is a plus. However, their set taco menu does not utilize each of the proteins. Meaning, the set menu has few options and it doesn't have one option for each of the proteins. The menu was a little confusing, but I liked that they had so many taco shell options. Additionally, the guacamole was very good. I only gave it three stars because I generally prefer street tacos and traditional tacos to the ones at condado. Worth a visit once, but not more than that.",

Lots of vegetarian options too - solidly beats Smoke and Bakersfield in this aspect. Highly recommend the double taco - a hard taco wrapped in a soft taco, so you get the crunch without it falling apart in your hands :) the chili tofu and cilantro sauce were great as well. They also serve yummy chips with guac and queso (though I must admit to liking the thicker queso at Bakersfield t).

    "text": "Another downtown taco place but what sets this restaurant apart is its extensive menu that you can personalize as well as an amazing happy hour spot!  Happy hour goes until 7 (our waitress thought it was 6 and we rushed to get our order in but were happy when she told us 7 and another round of drinks for us).  The beer list is extensive with a lot of unique options then there is a ton of cocktails including margaritas. At happy hour the drafts are $1 and the margaritas are 1/2 off.  All of the margaritas are served on the rocks-no frozen which I was a bit disappointed about.  You can add flavor for a $1 including peach, pomegranate, strawberry and blackberry which basically is them adding a pump of flavor to their original margarita. I tried the peach and strawberry and my husband had the blackberry. I recommend the strawberry as the blackberry was super sweet and the peach really didn't taste much different than regular.   You then have a few salsas, guacamole and queso to pick from served with chips which is a great started. We went with their roja salsa and regular guacamole. Unfortunately, they never brought us the salsa but that was ok as the guacamole was such a huge serving we could hardly eat it and I love guc!  The chips are very thick and not too greasy.   The hard part is next which is choosing your tacos. You have so many options from a bowl to flour or corn tortilla with a ton of veggie or meat options, fillings and sauces. I went with the flour soft shells, one with chicken the other with beef.  The shells were a bit hard and I did not like my creamy lime sauce but everything else was tasty. For an extra $1-$2 you can add beans or rice which comes served in a little cup.  Did I mention that the happy hour special is $3 tacos.  Pretty great deal. Our waitress was fantastic and it was packed-we were lucky to get  seated upstairs with a very short wait.",

We went on a Tuesday night around 6:30 and were seated upstairs right away at the last available table.   Our server was charismatic and informative and made the ordering process easy. The margaritas were good, but nothing special. I was slightly disappointed by the food. The tacos were okay but did not have the flavor I was looking for in the tortillas, meats, or toppings. I think fresh flour tortillas would make a big difference. The salsas were also only okay, which is crucial for any Mexican restaurant.   I may be back for a happy hour with friends, but I'd likely just spend a few extra bucks and head around the corner to Bakersfield.",

Condado has a really funky menu with a lot of awesome options-- both drinks and food. We started with the chips and salsa and the margarita flight. Our waiter was nice enough to let us try both salsas since we couldn't decide and they were BOTH awesome! I loved the margarita flight as they had so many different flavors available and it was a great way to get to try three of them. My personal favorite was the jalapeno flavor. For tacos, they have you make your selections on a slip of paper with both make your own options as well as some tacos they have hand selected. We did one make your own and two of the Condado Tacos (bubba kush and the mantis). All of the tacos were fabulous-- most with their signature stuffed crusts (hard shell with cheese and other wonderful goodies layered between a soft shell). Next time we are in Pittsburg we will certainly be back! Great service and great food!",

My food was cold, the waiter was rude and impatient, and the whole restaurant was overly crowded where my partner and I felt claustrophobic. I never usually complain about establishments, but when my partner wants to have tacos for their birthday and the experience was less than desirable, then something needs to be done.  I contacted the restaurant after my visit and spoke to the manager. She was very apologetic and sounded very sincere. She offered a refund and told me she'd speak to our waiter to make sure this doesn't happen again. After speaking to her, I am willing to give Condado Tacos another try my next visit to Pittsburgh.",

It was busy enough, on a Friday at 1:30, that we had to sit at the bar as there were no tables available.   I enjoyed the ambiance at Condado--it was well lit and had a fun,funky atmosphere similar to Voodoo Brewery or Mad Mex.   My coworker and I split the guacamole of the day, which was a peach-bourbon guacamole. This unique combination was good, if a little sweet. A nice aspect of Condado Tacos is that they offer free chip refills of their delicious tortilla chips.  Condado Tacos has a menu format similar to Burgatory, as you can either create your own taco or order one of their recommended tacos. I ordered one of the Surf N Turf tacos and I created two of my own. I wasn't wowed by the food, but the prices were especially good for Downtown Pittsburgh.  One pleasant and unexpected surprise was the delicious beer I ordered, which was a collaboration between Platform Brewing in Cleveland and Condado Tacos. While Condado had a large tequila selection, they also had an impressive display of whiskey behind the bar--everything from bourbon to Scotch to Japanese whiskey. I only drank beer, but I was impressed nonetheless.  All in all, I felt that Condado had a great atmosphere, great prices, and pretty good food.",

My friends and I could barely hear each other. Also, it was very dimly lit.   I did like the customization aspect of Condado. I could pick everything from the shell, protein, toppings, and sauce. I also liked that they did not have a limit on toppings or sauces. I had a sweet lucy shell, which I highly recommend. It is a soft flour tortilla, queso, and then a hard shell. I had mushrooms, corn salsa, cilantro and onion, and a cilantro lime aioli. They do not skimp on the toppings as my tacos were overflowing. My second taco was a goody goody taco with the bbq jackfruit, jicama slaw, salsa, and chipotle crema. I have never had bbq jackfruit and it was on the sweeter side, so I am glad I had a lot more spicier toppings to cut the sweetness.   Overall, for the food I give four stars. I enjoyed my tacos. My proteins were not warm, so then my overall taco really wasn't that warm. Also, my friend thought that their chicken was very bland and my other friend could not even eat her tofu taco. The floor was also very dirty and our table was sticky, so Condado has some work to improve on. But I will be back for the tacos!",

This isn't your traditional Mexican restaurant, it is Americanized but don't let that take anything away from it. At first sight it seems small but there are two levels, we went on a Monday and got sat upstairs. Our server Matthew was super kind and knowledgeable, he walked us through their menu (you can choose from their preset menu or you can create your own tacos). He also gave us tips about places to go after we had dinner and he steered us in the right direction.  We ordered a marg pitcher it was pretty decent for the price, filled about 6 glasses. We had the trio appetizer: the chorizo queso (banging), the salsa verde (pretty good), and the plain guac which was decent. Some of us ordered from the preset menu but I created my own tacos. The options are mouthwatering and they have choices for vegetarians (don't recall for vegans). You fill out a sanctron kind of menu that details all of the options and possible up-charges, you can choose more than one of the same or mix and match. I ordered two tacos and they were kind of big which was a surprise. We were stuffed so we didn't make it to dessert but we did have another round of drinks.  The combination of service, food, drinks, and decor make this a five star place for me. Seriously if you're in Pittsburgh and are in the mood for tacos, swing by it'll be worth it.",

For people who haven't gone here before, you can make your own taco with many different proteins, sauces, veggies, etc. and they have pre-chosen tacos if you don't feel like making your perfect taco. Anyways, the tacos were delicious and I always love a little kick so get the surf and turf if you like spicy! The margaritas are definitely one of the best I've ever had and I would definitely go back here the next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "Great spot to go with friends! Affordable tacos and cheap margaritas during happy hour. My favorite is the modelorito. At happy hour it is half off and includes a margarita and a modelo. Basically, two drinks for the price of one! I had a particularly good experience today at lunch. First, I was offered the opportunity to eat outside, which of course I said yes to! The outside seating is limited, therefore it is nice when places offer you a spot to sit outside instead of you always having to ask. We split a half portion of queso. The queso here is the best in Pittsburgh and being able to order an affordable half size for $4 is amazing! Such a deal. I like being able to pick my tacos. Pork is my favorite. Lastly, I liked that the waiter split our checks without even asking. Sometimes waiters get annoyed by the request and I'm happy it wasn't a bother, but expected!",

We had a couple dips to share and I was a little disappointed with the queso. Not as flavorful as the name diablo queso would lead you to believe. The pineapple guacamole was surprisingly good. We all did the make your own tacos. I would highly recommend the ju-ju or goody goody taco shells - their homemade chorizo is tasty and not too greasy. The only problem with build your own is that I have a tendency to put too many toppings on and then can't taste the individual flavors. But it is nice to be able to pick cheese, salsas, sauces without being charged extra. The flavored margaritas were okay - reasonably priced but very sweet. Next time I'll try the regular margarita. They also didn't put salt on the rim but it could've been because they were busy. Much better prices than Tako and the food is delicious - can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "We went here on a Friday night and only waited about ten minutes (or, as the hostess put it, a \"one margarita wait\" for a party of two).  The service was excellent.  As we had never been here before, the waitress took time out of her running from table to table to stop and explain everything to us, and she was very friendly and attentive.  I'd give the service itself 4 stars.  The food is good...not excellent, but there's a novelty and variety to it that made it something fun and different.  For a mini-chain restaurant, though, the ordering process was kind of overwhelming and confusing at first.  It uses the bubble-in sheets like a Burgatory, but I've always found designing my own burger to be self-explanatory.  This, not so much.  We had to ask for a lot of clarification, so I think they could save their servers some time if they reworked the bubble-sheet ordering form to be more clear and user-friendly.   The chips and salsa were pretty bland to be honest.  We really enjoyed the tacos and the margarita flights though.  Tequila was super-present, as it should be, but the interesting flavors offered for the margaritas could be easily distinguished as well.  Just one little word to the wise -- the double-layered taco (corn and flour tortilla) are huuuuuuuge (trademark).  I'm not a petite eater, but with two regular and one double-layered taco, I couldn't quite finish.  Not as good as Tako, but liked it better than a Mad Mex or Steel Cactus.",

An hour went by and I hadn't heard anything so I went to the host and asked how much longer for a table. She said we were next. So I went back upstairs and got another drink. I saw a table open up and the host seat another party. At this point I was getting annoyed. I went back to the host and asked why we weren't seated, and she said it was because that table seated 6 and we had 4, so we had to wait for a table of 4 to open. I asked how long it would be and she said she didn't know. I went back upstairs for another drink and saw a table of 4 open up and another party that I saw come in way after us was sat. So I went back down to the host to see what was going on. when she looked for my name on her tablet, it wasn't there. So Im assuming they gave our table away and lied to me both times I went to ask about our table. We were waiting for 2 hours at this point and was not happy. We left.

She asked if a high table was fine and I asked if a regular table was available and she seemed visibly annoyed that I was only one person taking up a table for 3. It was around 5pm when I went in and it wasn't that crowded either. Thankfully when my waitress got there, she was SUPER friendly and helpful and explained the whole menu to me and all the different styles of tacos and how to customize them since I wanted to build my own. She was great. The sauces definitely left me wanting more. I got their secret sauce and I would say it was more sour than spicy. Then again, I am Indian and used to ass-burning heat lol. So I would say if you want really spicy heat, this place won't do it for ya. I got the guac and chips and those were really good but wasn't a fan of the pickled onions on top of the guac. I did build your own tacos, one hard corn shell, one soft, both with rice and black beans on them, lettuce, cilantro, onions and queso fresca. The rice itself didn't have much flavor or seasoning to it and I was a bit surprised that there were only black beans offered and not refried. The black beans also weren't seasoned or anything at all so not much flavor. The other option if you don't eat meat was the tofu or mushrooms and I don't really eat either. I probably won't be back here.",

    "text": "I absolutely loved the experience here. The variety of tacos available is impressive and the quality is just as good. The margaritas are served in adorable mason jars and they have so many great flavors! Between my friend and I, we tried 4 different margs and I enjoyed each one (which isn't common). The staff was attentive and kind.   I think the fact that impressed me the most, besides the variety, is that there are multiple vegetarian options that are actually tasty! It can be hard to find something other than refried beans as  a vegetarian option in Mexican restaurants, but Condado successfully does that.   My only critiques are that the prices are rather steep for a college student, unless you come during happy hour, and that the wait is mighty long during that time. But with quality tacos and margs like this, I think that's warranted. I will definitely be returning!!",

    "text": "First let me say who should steer clear of Condado...  Mexican Purists: This is not your typical Mexican / Taco restaurant.  If you will get all pissed off because Condado taco's don't taste like every other taco you've eaten in your life you should stay away.  Snobs: Condado is small, it can get crowded and sometimes loud.  If you need somewhere quiet where you can spread out with your friends and talk about who has the best BMW you should probably go elsewhere.  Terrible Cooks:  This is a \"Build your own taco\" restaurant.  If you have absolutely no clue how flavors mix or a general idea of what flavors when put together would be pleasing to you, stay away (otherwise we will have to read your terrible review about how the food sucks, when in actuality it's you that sucks).   Now let me say who should go to Condado...  Foodies:  If your life revolves around new flavors,  fusions, and pushing the boundaries of your taste pallet then Condado is a 100% must visit!  I cannot stress this enough, the mixture of outstanding options is a veritable amusement park for your mouth.  Date Budget Hawks:  In my opinion this is one of the best date night deals in Pittsburgh...  You can get two of the most exciting, original and personally tailored tacos in existence, with two sides and a margarita / craft beer for around ~$14 - 20 per person (even cheaper at happy hour).  And don't worry, unlike many local Mexican restaurants,  Condado's atmosphere is trendy enough to qualify as a legit date location.    If you take a second to read the other reviews you will see the vast majority of 3 star or lower reviews come from people who didn't know WTF they were doing when they built their own taco or people who were pissed because the tacos were not \"authentic\" (as if eating the exact same king of taco you've eaten since kindergarten is some kind of great thing)...",

We got here a little early, around 5, and it's a good thing we did - we were able to get a seat at the bar but within 15 minutes they were packed! In order to get the happy hour deals you have to sit downstairs. So if you want a seat, plan accordingly.   We ordered their trio of dips as an appetizer and margaritas. We got their red salsa, this amazing quest with peppers in it, and their honey chipotle pineapple guacamole. I love that they had some different twists on classics (like pineapple in guacamole). All three were awesome, and came with large portions.   I did the build your own tacos. I got mine \"sweet Lucy\" style, which is a soft taco wrapped around a hard taco, smothered in quest and guacamole. I loved the combination of flavors and textures! I also loved the plentiful vegetarian options - they had three veggie proteins! I tried the Thai chili tofu and it was awesome. Very flavorful. The tacos are big - I ordered two and has trouble finishing after the dips.   The margaritas were also tasty, and we had good service. Since we are during happy hour, we also got an amazing deal! Between the two of us we ordered the trio of dips with chips, four tacos, and four margaritas - and it came in around $45. For all that quality food! I was impressed, and I will be back.",

We were charged for items we never received and not frequently checked on by our service. The food was okay. It was room temp by the time we received it.

Everything was very fresh tasting & their corn tortillas were THE BEST.

Love the staff downtown Pittsburgh, except for one woman who was extremely rude and screamed at me to move out of her way at the downtown location while I was trying to get a drink during happy hour and then take it upstairs. Would have gladly moved out of the way and stayed out of the way with a simple \"excuse me\". Another bartender was very unfriendly and rolled her eyes multiple times at us as we told her our drink order and gave her our cards. I was almost angry enough to ask for their names, and wish I had now. Luckily, the rest of the staff being lovely has persuaded me to return.   Also...the amount of waste produced by Condado is absurd. I don't know why they don't just get plates and real silverware instead of plastic silverware, aluminum foil, paper tray, and wax paper that have a total life span of about 1 minute while you down your taco. Companies like Condado need to take responsibility for the damage they are doing to our earth.",

I've never tried the pre-made tacos, but I always have a blast ordering my own creations. They have a variety of shells--flour, hard corn shells, and a couple of combinations of both, some with melted cheese, beans, etc. The chorizo is probably my favorite meat there, and it's a nice place for people that are lactose intolerant--it's so easy to skip the cheese!!   The margs are fun too--I enjoy the banana one a lot! I've been back, and will be back.",

More taco combinations than any person can comprehend and the tastes and flavors to go along. If you don't ever read another review take my advice and get to Condado ASAP. You'll thank me later ;)",

    "text": "I have been back to Condado a few times since my first visit when they first opened and I just don't feel they are living up to their original standard they set last year for me.  While their food, in my opinion, is still good and their combinations creative/endless, my issue stands with their service.  If I were rating based on service and the interaction I've had with employees alone, I'd give 2 stars and even that is being generous.  I've been here 3-4 times with reservations and it's never been a simple process. I would think with such a large upstairs space and the fact that they promote brunch so heavily on the weekends, that they would expect the crowd that comes and not act like they're trying to keep their head above water taking care of customers.  During any visit I've made recently, there were issues with the reservation not being communicated/tables not being set up, the service being slow/confusing/clustered or our food not coming out correctly.  These are all relatively minor things to be resolved, but creates an irritating experience when they happen, especially on a repeated basis. The employees seem to be there more to interact with each other and socialize than to actually do their job.   This past weekend we had a large party for my birthday and while our waitress was doing the best she could, they set us up in this most misconsTrued configuration of 3 tables all facing different direction and we had one person taking care of all of us ON TOP of her other tables upstairs.  This caused a lot of confusion both for her and us and probably would have been helpful to have more hands on deck.  Not to mention not one person at my table felt they actually received what they ordered, but that's not the waitress' fault.  Overall I love the idea and the atmosphere (and the margs) at Condado, but there are definitely areas that need work.  Seems fun & great for a group of people, but ends up being more frustrating and inconvenient, in my experience, once it's all said and done.",

I love love love the ordering system. You choose from the printed list what you want on your taco and you can customize down to the tiniest detail. They also offer daily specials and I'm bummed that I was too full to try the Korean BBQ taco with kimchee but if it's offered the next time I got I will absolutely save room!

The bar vibe was great and I can only imagine it got better and louder as the tequila flowed and the crowds swelled. Fortunately, there is an upstairs which also has a fully stocked bar and a less raucous feel. The wait staff is engaging and knowledgeable, and the food delicious. I particularly liked the ability to build my own taco and order more or less depending. The guacamole is particularly good: dense and highly flavorful. Great and very serious selection of liquor and beers, and don't forget to ask about the special food and drinks menu that rotates monthly. This place is a must-seek when in Pittsburgh.",

Additionally, yes, it is an extremely tight space with very small tables.   Anyways. The biggest let down were (you guessed it!) the tacos! I mean, COME ON. if you're gonna specialize in literally ONE type of food -- you gotta get it right! (Insert that \"they had one job\" joke here)   Condado definitely missed the mark for me. I ordered the brisket tacos with cilantro and onions, slaw and lettuce. These were borderline disgusting. There was hardly any meat on it. A tablespoon is a generous estimate. Next, it was served fresh out of the refrigerator! Not even room temp, but completely cold. Zero seasoning or flavor and smelled like dog food.   The cilantro and onions were barely noticeable, and I'm almost certain they just forgot the slaw because there was hardly anything else on it except for some soggy lettuce. Finally, I got a side of rice for $1 -- served in those tiny little black containers most restaurants use for condiments. That is also a tremendous waste and laughable. Basically a little shot of rice. Cool.   My one time experience here made Taco Bell look like a three Michelin Star establishment.",

The tacos were good, but the flavor wasn't as developed as I had hoped for the flavor combos that I was able to pick on the create your own. Food came out very quick.  Warning the mango habanero sauce is mainly habanero tasting with just a touch of mango, I was hoping for the opposite. It overpowered the taco.

They have a great selection of ingredients too, so you will definitely find something you love, or something new to try. I recommend getting a few different tacos so you can switch up the ingredients and get different levels of heat. Their Happy Hour is great too, half price margaritas, which are fantastic, and chips with guac or queso. Even the chips that come with the guac were delicious. They were fresh and had a perfect amount of salt fried onto them. The perfect complement to the flavorful guacamole. Portion sizes are large too, these are full tacos so you fill up fast and get a good amount for what you're paying for. Prices are definitely reasonable for the quality of food you are getting too. Keep in mind how crowded this restaurant gets on the weekends and during Happy Hour. For 2 of us, it was about a 20 minute wait at 6pm, which wasn't bad, but we just had to stand on the stairs until our table was ready because the bar was packed. Definitely recommend going here!",

    "text": "Condado, you've grown on me. My initial review was a 3 star, but over the last couple visits, I've become obsessed with their tacos. They offer a couple vegetarian options: tofu, mushrooms, and pulled jackfruit. All are fantastic but my favorite is definitely the tofu. Their build-your-own taco menu has so many customizable options so no matter what you're into, they'll have it. It's a popular spot so expect a wait to get in during happy hour. Noise level can get obnoxiously loud so you'll have to scream across the table if you want to have a conversation. Or you can be like me and use it as an excuse to focus on eating the entire time.",

With a topping check list and a pencil, you choose how wild or safe your tacos will taste.   The best part is the outside shell options: if you thought it was just soft or hard, corn or flour, you were wrong! Get wild, go condado.   At just $3.50 a taco, you can switch it up and not feel bad about it.   Great location, but a little tight on space. I will definitely return.",

I was actually pretty pleased with the visit.  The chips are thick and extra crispy and the tacos were quite tasty. The menu can be a bit confusing until they explain it to you. You can build your own tacos or choose their \"suggested\" tacos. Be careful with ordering the chips as the queso dip can be 6 or 8 dollars, very expensive unless you are sharing with multiple people at the table!  I like the peezler shell (sandwiched with bean spread and had a nice hearty flavor) and the chorizo meat.    I attempted to order and pick up to save time but after showing up, I still had to wait another 20 mins to get 3 tacos.  That was a bit disappointing but won't deter me from ordering again.",

Our waiter started out okay but since this is our first time coming and we mentioned it I expected him to kinda give us the explanation on everything and how to order, he didn't. I also assume he was like in a mood because he was kinda short and not very helpful but the manager Janine came in and saved the day and gave us amazing suggestions and apologized for the shortness of our waiter. We would come back just because she was so sweet. Food was good, not a fan of the chicken but steak and shrimp super good.",

    "text": "We tried this place on Saturday afternoon. When we arrived it was already crowded. The first floor has about a dozen tables and a bar. The hostess took us upstairs where there was quite a bit more seating.   We ordered the guacamole and chips to start as well as a margarita for the hubs and a sangria for me. The guac was a pretty large portion in comparison to many other places. And the chips were fresh which was a huge plus. The margarita was good, but the sangria was not my favorite.  We both ordered two tacos a piece. The hubs ordered from the suggested menu and I did the \"build your own\".  The tacos were large and very tasty! My first taco had the beef with standard toppings and my second taco had pulled pork with a pineapple salsa. They were both delicious.  Hubs tried one of the vegetarian tacos and he loved it. That's saying quite a lot since he is definitely a meat eater.  When we left the line waiting for a table was huge. We obviously beat the rush. This place has some obvious pluses and not many cons.  Pros: Tasty tacos  Good value in the guac Fresh chips Homemade salsas Good prices  Nice location   Cons: Sangria could use some work  Drinks are a bit pricey  Crowded place The beans are way too salty- not good   All in all we will definitely be back. But we will certainly do our best to hit them at a slow time.",

Condado was the latest to join and at first I was thinking \"really, more tacos??\" However, I think Condado brings something different and I find myself coming here quite often.   This is a create your own taco place even though I've actually never done that. The gazillion different options kind of overwhelms me so I usually get the pre-designed tacos. I've tried a number of items from their \"Taco Suggestions\" menu and my favorites would have to be \"The Mantis\" and \"Surf n Turf.\" I typically don't go with vegetarian options but The Mantis is to die for! Condado's tacos are quite substantial (I'm usually full after two) and they are also super affordable.   While the space might seem small, there is a whole second level. Service is also pretty quick so it's a great place for a quick lunch! Although I'd be ok with Condado's tacos any time of day!",

    "text": "#TacoTues, #queso and #margs are certainly all the rage lately; and you've probably heard a millennial raving about this place - but let me assure you this place is more than an Instagram foodies' dream come True! Condado is just simply fun and delicious.  I have visited many times and always leave full and satisfied from the food. I will keep returning as there are so many options to create your own margaritas, chip & dip companions, and taco creations.   Anyplace that has margarita flights is for me. I love that I can try a few of the fruit flavors and not break the bank at $15 for 3 decently sized margs. I am particular about drinks and I do enjoy their margaritas. Plus they are relatively inexpensive (for a downtown spot) .  I also love that Condado offers fresh chips with flaky salt (important) plus many unique salsa combinations, fresh guac and flavorful queso.   I could fill up on just chips and dip -  but then there are the tacos. You get to build your own tacos for a reasonable price! I stick to the non-spicy options and have plenty of elements to choose from. I love their unique taco shell combinations, pulling both soft and hard shell with cheese and chorizo in between - delicious!  My first visit I ordered 3, when one was probably large enough. They come fully stuffed and are'nt dry due to all the cheese, salsas and sauce you can have packed on top.   I definitely enjoy their food, but for me the service has always been underwhelming. All but 1 server I've had has been uninspiring. Serve has been very transactional and servers are uninterested in answering questions and or sharing suggestions. I remember being lost of the process during my first visit. The menus are confusing and the monthly features are not easy to find - and the servers definitely do not offer to walk you through the form or the multiple menus, nor do they mention the special dip or meat of the month.   My most recent visit I actually did have a pleasant, friendly server. I sat outside and she must have been inspired by the sun as she did welcome sharing suggestions.  :)",

Unfortunately, the service at this location does not compare to their other locations, especially the several locations in Columbus Ohio. Our server messed up our drink order, which is understandable since we were a large party of 8. However, he made limited appearances, which prevented us the opportunity to tell him that the drink order was incorrect.  After about 20 minutes with not seeing our server, one of the guest in our party decided to go to bar to get his desired drink, which caught our server's attention. Our sever came over to our table and said it's disrespectful for us to get a drink from the bar and that it was cutting into the amount of money he made off our table. He was pretty sassy and we explained that a trip to the bar would have never been made if he came over to check on us in a timely manner to inform him of the mistaken drink order. Fortunately, the food was amazing and met our expectations! Service could have been better but we were all happy with our meals.",

    "text": "Coming from Columbus, OH I am a HUGE fan of Condados and so I was so excited to try out the Pittsburgh locations.   The night my friends and I decided to go to this location, there were a few events going on downtown so it was definitely a busy night, which we understood. We put our names in, didn't get an estimated wait time, but were told we could walk around the area and we would get a text. We ended up going to the rooftop bar at Sienna Mercato for some drinks to pass the time, but when we got the text that our table was ready, it turns out you only have a few minutes (i think it was ~5?) to get back to claim your table but that was impossible for us. We got to Condados 2 minutes late, after waiting 40 minutes, and were told our table was gone but they would put us at the top of the list and get us the next available table. After waiting another 20 minutes, and seeing other tables get seated, we asked the hostess again and it turns out we were never actually added back to the list but that they would give us the next available table. We ended up waiting 1.5 hours meanwhile they had 2 tables saved for a large party, but it was 40 minutes past the time of that table's reservation but they continued to hold those spots and I don't think that's fair.   Now to the food and drinks. The tacos are amazing and I love that you're able to build your own because that's what truly makes Condados unique. My friends and I shared chips & salsa/guac. I've gotta say we were upset when we found out they were out of the pineapple and corn salsas but their quesos and guacs were amazing, so in the end it was alright. Those of us who got tacos, got 2 and those of us who got the bowls weren't able to finish it because the portions are a bit large for the bowls, so well worth it! The drinks were inconsistent. We had one pitcher of margs that was so strong and you could pretty much only taste the tequila but the others were perfectly balanced in flavor. And it wasn't just the pitchers, one of the girls got the single glasses and you could just tell by looking at the two that they were completely different shades of orange and vastly different in taste.   Overall, the food is what we were there for so it was worth it, but we could've gone without the wait. And it would be better if there was more consistency with their drinks.",

Our waiter was patient in explaining things to my group since none of us had ever been here. He recommended good tequila shots and was on top of the water refills without being asked, all while managing several busy tables.   The guac and chips were delicious. The chips were perfect, fresh, and amazing. The guac was also good but a little on the spicy side. Most of us ate 2 tacos and were stuffed, all of which were packed with lots of flavor and a little bite. One of the guys we were with was reluctant to eat here because he doesn't usually get full on tacos but after 3 of these tacos stated he was surprised how full he was.

    "text": "I'd heard that the Condado tacos were amazing, so I was only a little disappointed when I realized that their existence meant the very first restaurant I went to in Pittsburgh had disappeared (The Tonic Bar and Grill).  And the verdict that I reluctantly came to were that although the chips and salsas were exceptional, the tacos were not. After stuffing my face with chips and gushing about how they were the best I had - were they double fried? when the tacos came, I excitedly opened up the foil because well, tacos have a special place in my heart.    My first bite made me wonder if somewhere between drowning my margarita I had accidentally ordered a frozen taco. I tried to get over it and explore the unique flavors that I knew were there but it was extremely difficult to get past the initial disappointment.  However, their chips and salsa were satisfying, the margaritas pretty good, and the place has an artsy, edgy vibe - so all in all, a place worth hitting for happy hour, maybe not so much for a full course dinner.",

    "text": "This is my favorite Mexican in the world. For starters, the inside is decked out in Mexican graffiti and modern decor which is awesome. Next, for appetizers, I just get the original guacamole and salsa verde and have never looked back since they are fire. Next you get to customize your tacos. Don't skip out on the Juju or Sweet Lucy for the extra $1. It makes the taco go from a 8.5 to a 10. I'm drooling thinking about it. Their margs are ALSO FIRE. And also a little dangerous  since they are so good. I like the wait staff - they're always friendly and attentive. All in all this place is a must go - I haven't had anything that rivaled Condados.",

    "text": "Good spot for varied tacos downtown. You fill out your order on notepads, so you can follow their suggestions, or get crazy with it and create your own. Of note that make them different than other taco places are their shells. You can get various shells with cheese and other fillings that really set them apart from the usual corn or flour offerings.   The bar really shines here as well. They have a good draft list and the bartenders can whip up a good many cocktails. Personally, you can never go wrong with a margarita, but some of their specialty cocktails will give that classic a run for it's money.   If the upstairs isn't open the downstairs can feel small, but once they have both levels going it's a good sized spot!",

It was fun to design your own taco, selecting covering type, protein, toppings, cheeses, sauce, etc. Even a basic with no extras for $3.50 was a good deal.   I had a soft taco with shrimp ceviche, pineapple salsa, lime cilantro sauce, and a mild white crumbled cheese. It was incredibly refreshing and tasty.  Everyone in our group loved their food. Too bad we aren't local or we could eat here more often!",

Nothing super special...The service is pretty awful and I don't think it is the servers' fault. They seem to get stacked with such large sections and that is not their fault. The tacos are obviously good, but the timing of the apps and tacos are awful. The tables are so tiny you can't even fit it all, that's after we had the hostess take away the wooden contraption. I tried their red pepper & pineapple marg, the presentation was sooo pretty. But, the taste. I was not a fan... I even love fresh squeeze juices, so I thought I would have loved it, not really. I took a few sips and couldn't do it anymore. Our server was so busy, I couldn't even order something else.  My favorite part of my trip? The dirty sauce, I do not know what's in it that makes it spicy, but I'm obsessed!",

    "text": "Although the tacos were tasty as hell (the margarita was weak) this place is an accessibility nightmare. I'm considered a young, able-bodied individual who's made it through this world without too much trauma, but LORD, if anyone with the SLIGHTEST touch or claustrophobia or sexual trauma would not be able to exist here. Neither would someone who struggles reading/understanding English (this is a Tex-Mex restaurant), is hard of hearing, hard of sight, in a wheelchair, with a cane, with children, a service animal, someone wider than 20 inches, and a whole slew of other average people conditions. I was inadvertently touched countless times sitting at a very high top table with no seat back with my back turned to what was supposed to be a walkway with another row of seats for the bar no less that 25 inches between. I felt so many bodies brush past me, and my server, who was taking a order for the table next to me, leaned in to hear the their order and their body became flush with my phone in my back pocket. That means leaning with a considerable weight against my ass, to be clear.  THIS SHOULD NOT GO WITHOUT MENTIONING: You are required to place your own order through a menu pad that reads like an SAT demographic bubble form (in this dimly lit mf-in bar). My partner and I are college-educated, American-born, English-speaking peeps and this arrangement for ordering food is absurd. Is it too hard to talk to folx, servers (or rather ownership, who thought it was cheeky to order this way)? This creates a huge and potentially embarrassing obstacle for people with intellectual processing issues, and most of the aforementioned conditions I listed above. The server didn't mention the way to order until they came back to retrieve our choices, then had to explain how the hell this system works, which I imagine is an annoyingly regular occurrence. I feel for the workers here. We had to kinda figure it out on our own. But what if you want four different tacos? One sheet only has two columns and asks for one name--do you use two forms? Or what if only two people are dining and you each want two of the same thing (respectively) can you use one sheet and save the trees? There are a lot of ways this could go and there was no warning that this ordering system in this stimuli-ridden restaurant (dim lights, loud music, people touching me everywhere) is anxiety inducing af.  Some thought should be given to how many people can physical squeeze into a building vs how many people can comfortably exist in a building. This layout and consideration to access could use some work.",

My second taco I got the mango habanero sauce thinking the sweet and spicy would be a great on a taco and it ended up being so spicy I couldn't eat the taco.

You serve one type of food so the tacos should be at least decent!   The menu was a little overwhelming and confusing. Once I tasted the tacos, saying I was disappointed would be an understatement. It was probably one of the worst tacos I've had. It was so bland and literally tasted like cardboard. I got a side of rice for 1$ which was also really bad and I don't really know how anyone could mess up rice. After a couple bites, the tacos made me a little nauseous, not really sure why.   In addition to the bad food, the space was really small and not comfortable at all.   I guess the only good thing I can say about this place is that the waitress was nice!   DO BETTER Condado.",

Condado is good when you're downtown during happy hour and you want your taco fix, but I wouldn't go out of my way otherwise. For happy hour, the tacos here are a good price and decent quality. Great portion sizes too; each taco is seriously hefty. (But way overpriced during normal hours. Save your meals here for happy hour.)The ability to customize your order is another plus, and I enjoyed getting to try a range of meats and toppings. The joy here is mostly in the novelty and the variety, though, and I found most offerings to be either blandly cooked or overwhelmingly saucy. Other notes: chips were awesome! Margs were somehow both way too sweet and watered down. Stick with the beer. Ambiance was lively and crowded, but well managed. Opt for outdoor seating so you can enjoy the downtown scene! Overall, I do see myself returning to Condado, but only for happy hour.",

The original taco was fab and the bubba kush taco was great even though we had to substitut the pulled pork for brisket! Chips and salsa was $1.50 and gave awesome chips with two salsa. Big fan of the skinny skeleton drink as well as the Modelo-Marg combo!",

I could totally sit in front of the tv and eat their queso and chips all night. The tacos were good but then menu was a bit overwhelming since you have to build it yourself. Lots of options so they had something for everyone but I keep my tacos simple so it was too long for me. The tacos and queso were different menus so that was a bit confusing as well. The flight of margaritas was outstanding. Great taste and good value. Had blackberry, mango and strawberry. Very good and the BlackBerry was my favorite. The service was fast and friendly. The location is a bit small but we didn't have to wait for a table. We are certainly going back for the food and drinks this is a very nice place.",

There are plenty of taco options to keep everyone happy, I ordered a Lucy taco with chicken and a soft flour taco with tofu - the food came out quickly and hot. I was nervous to try the tofu as it can be really hard to cook but to my surprise it was fantastic! Lots of flavor. The chicken taco was good as well but nothing to write home about.",

When our text came in that our table was ready, the hostess looked at us like we were aliens and said there wasn't a table for us (even though we saw many empty ones). Off to a rocky start!! Once we made ourselves known three times we finally were seated.   I had been forewarned that there are MANY menus. I don't think I took my friends seriously enough. There was a drink menu, appetizer menu, pre-made taco menu, build your own taco menu, and I think one more. Our waitress did explain everything briefly, but we felt like we were left to our own demise. Thankfully, everyone in our group was ready to be adventurous and build tacos from the very yummy options.   We started with the blanco nacho cheese and corn salsa. YUM. I would go back just for the apps. We all built our own tacos and there wasn't a sad soul at the table. Everything was flavorful, hot, and delicious. Absolutely worth the wait and confusion. I will be going back!!",

The tacos are fresh and flavorful and they have a great selection of beers, tequila, etc.  The various dips offered for the chips were also very good and diverse.  My wife is Gluten Free and they were easily able to accommodate her needs.  Although they have many types of tacos (both pre-suggested combinations and build your own (kind of like Burgatory)), that is where the menu ends.  Tacos.  Nothing else.  In addition, the restaurant was packed and there was a 30 minute late.  Finally, beware that it is a young crowd.  We are in our early to mid-50s and we were old enough to be the parents of just about everyone in the place - patrons and employees.  It did not make a difference in the food, service, etc., but just letting readers know so that they know what to expect.",

Not that it always fills up, which sometimes it does, but it's best to get in before the servers get too busy. The difference between 11:30 and 12:00 can be night and day.   There are tons of options from type of shell, to none, to proteins and toppings and sauces and salsas.  And mostly they're perfectly fine. I don't think I've had a single thing here's that's wow'd me and made me order it over and over, but even the strangest combinations will not disappoint.

Food: Started with the mango margarita and they definitely did not cheap out on the tequila. One drink was just right for me. We moved on to the Tuscan Guac which was probably the best I've had in a while and a great portion, with two people eating it we only got half way through.  I got the JuJu taco (soft and hard with queso in the middle) with pulled pork, slaw, beans, onions and salads. So good, I devoured it in seconds.   Service: we came here the night before and the wait was too long. They do give the option to text you when the table becomes available but we were too hungry to wait. Today we got lucky and got a two seater fairly fast despite the rush. Our waiter was enthusiastic me fast. I was surprised at how fast everything came out. I guess this is what happens when you specialize in one thing.   Atmosphere: Seems like everything around my hotel in Pittsburgh is just really loud. Found my self having to repeat myself twice when talking due to the loud talking and music. I wonder if it would have been any different upstairs.   If I lived here I'd def come here for my tacos.",

If you are familiar with Burgatory or any restaurant that allows you to customize your burger by filling out a check list with a pencil, then this is the same concept, but for tacos.

There were four menus but I only got water for the drink, so that cut the menus down to two. After looking at the create your own taco menu, I gave up and switched to the pre-designed taco menu. That turned out to be a good idea because one of the items on that menu was the Chronic Tortilla Fritos. (bowl of nachos) That was a very filling item for the price. I also tried the Bubba Kush, a pulled pork taco with an interesting flavor. I do like the idea of using a booklet of tear-off fill-in forms for the taco menu. In a noisy bar environment, this avoids the problem of an order getting misheard.  Service was pretty good despite the crowd. I sat at the bar for this meal and the bartender was quite responsive and made sure I had everything I needed. The problem is the dining area is a bit cramped and groups of people who hang around near the bar get in the way of servers and everyone else.",

This was a Mexican joint, not Asian restaurant.   As for the service, well, that too was found lacking. Asked for a taste of a beer on tap and got literally a few drops, barely enough to cover the bottom of the tiny glass.  Beer was good though.

Our waiter came quickly and offered us drink menus. He suggested the blood orange and prickly pear, which we both tried. I thought the prickly pear was a little too sweet, and coming from me, that means the drink must've been really sweet. My boyfriend had the blood orange which I enjoyed more - it had a nice tang to it that balanced out the sweetness.  The queso though. I would go back for just the queso any day. We got the dirty queso which had black beans, chicken, and a smoky spicy sauce. It ranks up there in one of the best quesos I've had, and came with plenty of fresh chips too.   I opted to make my own tacos, and tried two of the special shells. The tacos were absolutely stuffed with toppings and sauces, all of which were free of charge! I really liked the chorizo and the shell with retried beans stood out too.   Definitely will be back to try more taco combinations and margaritas!",

This place is about as good as it gets. Theres almost endless combinations for tacos, so youll definitely be able to find something you like. Aside from the tacos, the sides are great too. Good beer selection and a wide variety of margaritas and tequilas to chose from. Pretty cool place to hang out or hit up before/after a baseball game",

    "text": "My Friends and I tried this \"five star, award winning\" restaurant yesterday to celebrate finishing our final exams. We arrived at the restaurant around 5 o'clock so we would have plenty of time to enjoy the 3$ margaritas for happy hour; Which are only the special price if you order a plain margarita although they advertise flavors. The host was amazing in explaining to us the ridiculous rule that you can only take part in happy hour on the first floor of the restaurant where of course there were no more tables. We got our drinks at the downstairs bar and the host showed us upstairs to a table. (if there is a bar downstairs and upstairs why is happy hour only circulating around the downstairs portion?)  After sitting at our table with no service at all for 30 minutes we began getting frustrated. The restaurant was not crowded upstairs at all and the 5 waiters we asked to place our order all pushed us off saying they \"would send our server right over\". After another 10 minutes I personally walked up to the bar to ask the bartender if he could take our food orders and again I was told \"our server would be right over\". Finally after 40 minutes of sitting with no service our waiter came over and rudely took our order. Not even introducing himself or I would give a name. Our food did come out crazy fast and was excellent! Props to the kitchen who was obviously on top of their game! After finishing eating we asked for waters which never came and our checks which took another 25 minutes to show up! One of the girls who was with our group even walked up to the POS to explain how to print the checks! We made sure we left exact change so we didn't have to worry about waiting to get our change back.  Coming from 5 years of restaurant experience I have never seen customer service so horrible. There was many opportunities for other waiters/waitresses to come over to make sure we were taken care of. Especially when tables around us were seated, food brought out, checks delivered, and we haven't even been greeted.  While the food was amazing from the kitchen and the drinks were wonderful from the bar I will not be returning to Condado.  When I go out to eat, no matter the occasion, I want to be treated with respect, and if anything WAITED ON!  Great food, great drinks, WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.",

Tacos are create-you-own so it's very much catered to the individual who is nervous to try new things or who doesn't like to over-do their meal. With that being said, if you have high standards for Mexican food or just restaurant service in general, you will probably be happier going Tako or Bakersfield, or even Steel Cactus if you're looking for the going out vibe. Each taco is $3, but the add on's can get really excessive ($1 extra for sour cream...why??). The actual food is very comparable to something I can make at my house, but the overall vibe is really great for a cheap taco night with all of your friends. The ambiance and overall experience is great. And I must say, the margaritas are fantastic!! From someone who does not enjoy tequila, the margaritas were so delicious! Many of my friends ordered the margarita flight, which allows you to sample multiple flavors which we loved every single one.",

I like how you can choose from the sheet what kind of tacos you want and the price point is really great for the quality of food you are getting.
