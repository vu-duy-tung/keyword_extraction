If you're going to offer pizza by the slice then you probably shouldn't cook it completely if all you're going to do is throw it back in the oven to heat it up. both times it was cold anyway and the extra oven time only served to make it dry and burnt on the bottom. So disappointed. I should probably order a whole pie to get the \"real\" experience, but my money won't be spent there again. Best in Pittsburgh? Not the individual slices, that's for sure.",

    "text": "Overview: We were passing through on our way to Chicago and stopped to see a few sights.  We asked a local where the best pizza was and he sent us to Slice on Broadway, and are we glad he did.  I couldn't stop thinking about the crust, the pizza was cooked perfectly and they seem to pride themselves on high quality ingredients.   Pizza Shop:  Great shop, very clean and welcoming feel to it.  I like that the kitchen is mostly open to the dinning area.  Unique \"vault,\" from when this place was a bank, creates a special private room for a family of 4 or 5 to dine.  The kids loved it.  I also always check out bathrooms, because if a place wants to cut corners the bathroom is a good place because not many guests see it.  These were spotless!  Service:  The staff was second to none.  Our order was taken promptly and all food came out accurate.  They were very friendly and attentive all while giving us space to enjoy our great meal.   Pizza: I like that you can get pizza by the slice here and that was one thing the local pointed out when sending us here.  That way each of the kids could get their own topping and the slice would be ready for a quick grab and go.  We were so charmed by the staff and setting that we decided to eat in house.        Crust: awesome, made the biggest impression on me, perfectly crispy without being over cooked or too well done.  It was some of the best crust I have tasted and I still think about it.       Sauce: Good flavor, could tell that it was likely homemade.        Cheese: nice blend of mozzarella and provolone.  Perfect amount.        Toppings: Pineapple was standard, then again, who the heck puts pineapple on a pizza! Sausage was good.  I prefer sliced over the crumbed but the benefit of how this place does it (crumbed/clumped) was that you had a good sausage flavor in every bite.    Salad:  Above average pizza place salad, no iceberg lettuce, good veggies  Usually I have something negative to say, but this was such an overall positive experience that nothing stands as negative.  This would definitely be my pizza shop if I was a local and is also a great stop for anyone passing through that wants to grab a slice!",

If you like pizza with a thinner crust then you will thoroughly enjoy the pizza here. All of the toppings are tasty with my favorite being peperoni and sausage. Their hoagies are also very good here, though they are slightly on the smaller side of a typical hoagie. Lastly the staff at The Slice is always very friendly and great at doing their jobs. Consistently good food and great service!",

We both got pepperoni slices and agreed the crust was very good. Nice thin but doughy body and a handle that was crisp on the outside but soft inside. The cheese was high quality and the right amount. The red sauce was on the thinner side but flavorful and definitely noticed on the slice. We tried a meatball and pepperoni roll, each served with a side of sauce. Both were tasty snacks. Will definitely be back here or to Beechview.",

    "text": "I am struggling with exactly what to say about this place because I see so many rave reviews on how fabulous their pizza is. I just brought home an 8 cut with a couple toppings and an antipasto salad. The pizza was of decent quality sauce and toppings wise but the amount of topping is scant to say the least and the crust requires some healthy chompers to chew. I mean it is brutal. To boil this down I guess, for me, it is a matter of value. This 8 cut could have been folded in half and eaten like a taco. Very small pizza for a price of over $13.00. The salad was fine. Fresh and crisp with a nice selection of meats and so forth. Again, not very big for a price of over $9.00. I guess what I am saying is if you plan on feeding a number of people you had better order a lot of stuff and be prepared to drop some cash. I guess to bottom line this I would say the food is average, at best, and the value/price ratio is poor. Won't be going back only because I can get better for less and more of it. By the way, as a matter of safety, be careful after dark at this location. Carnegie is not a great area to begin with and this shop is located in one of the less attractive parts of the borough.",

It is the one pizza place in Pittsburgh my husband and I both agree on and we've certainly tried them all - Fiori's, Campiti's, Mineo's, Beto's, but I think hands down, Slice has them all beat. But, again, I'm partial to a thin crust which is why I love it. Before they opened their Carnegie location, we frequently drove to their original location on Broadway.   If we stop during the week and I need a healthier option, their salads are also great. I know what you're thinking, why would you come here for the salad? But, I just love their house-made balsamic dressing and their spinach salad. And if I'm really still craving the pizza, they have perfect little pepperoni rolls that are delicious, as well.   They have a lot of variety for a pizza shop and use all fresh ingredients. There are alos specialty pizzas and sandwiches and they deliver in the Carnegie area. And, now I'm craving Slice after writing this review... :)",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday night for dinner with my wife and a friend of ours. The inside of this place has a decent setup with a bar (not the alcohol type) to sit at near the front window, then 4 or so tables behind that in the heart of the restaurant.  The coolest part is that it looks like this location used to be a bank as the vault area is still there and you can actually sit inside of it.  We thought about doing just that before ultimately deciding that the lack of windows and enclosed feeling wasn't really worth it.  The employees here were also really nice and pleasant to us the whole time that we were there.  I think that they had a good sense of humor too as when the three of us were leaving we were talking about heading to Fiori's, another local South Hills pizza joint, the next time we met up.  The last thing I heard right before the front door shut from two of the gentlemen working there was how we had just said the F word (Firori's of course) so I got a good laugh about that.  For our dinner we decided to go with one of the specials from their flyer and ordered two large one topping pizzas.  For the first pizza we decided to have the traditional red sauce with sliced chicken on it while for the second pizza we chose the green sauce (basil pesto sauce, made with fresh basil, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, pecorino Romano cheese, and pine nuts) with pepperoni as our topping.  After ordering we proceeded to our seats for the little wait before our pizzas came out.  The pepperoni with green sauce came out first and it was followed shortly thereafter by the traditional pizza with chicken.  As with all pizzas these two can be broken down into their three main components: sauce, cheese and crust.  The crust is easily my favorite part of Slice's pizzas as it is thin and has a good crispiness to it.  The two sauces for the pizza were quite different from each other but I think that I liked the green sauce a little more than the red sauce.  The reason for this is that I think that the green sauce stood out a bit more to me with its basil flavor although they were both good and had some nice spices in them.  Last but not least was the cheese of which there was an ample amount and it had a good flavor to it.  The only thing about our visit that I wasn't a huge fan of ended up being the amount of oil that ended up on the last pieces of our green sauce pizza.  You see we started eating the pizza from one side as most people do.  As we ate more and more of it the pan started leaning towards the now much heavier side and so the large amount of oil from both the cheese and the pesto sauce ended up covering the bottom of our last few slices.  At least you could tell that they used a real olive oil in their pesto!  The bottom line for me is that I will definitely head back here again in the future.  It has both a good location and setup and its employees always seem to be friendly.  Of course there is the pizza too which is quickly becoming one of my favorites in Pittsburgh!",

Calling to ask why delivery arrived 1/2 hour after they said it would be there will get you an \"I'm sorry\" but nothing else... Really pretty awful.. Disappointed and in a salt coma after less than a 1/4 of a sub, and 1 slice of pizza.",

The pizza is a thinner crisp crust which I prefer.  The sauce is pretty good too.  The Slice philosophy is to make as much as possible from scratch and use good fresh ingredients.   The shop is in a little store front with about 5 tables and a few seats in the window.   Also a little room with a big bank type vault door in the back.  It was pretty hot in the shop since it is not air conditioned.  So at this time of year you may want to take out.   The take out menu states that it is BYOB.",

I've had Mineos, A'pizza Badamo, Fiori's (my 2nd fav), Beto's, Aiello's, and Spak Bros.....Slice on Broadway is number one. Thin, crispy, sauce not to sweet...and tasty. IMO - to determine the best pizza place..try the plain no frills cheese pizza. If that holds up against others...that's your winner. Also, Slice just knows how to run a business - floors, tabletops, and bathrooms were spotless...uber clean and not something I expected from a pizza joint. The cleanliness is a bonus...the pizza itself earned 5 stars on it's own. Pic here is my personal fav - extra cheese.",

They were ok. Not awful, but nothing to write home about. I never judge a pizza place on slices alone, however, because they just can't compare to a whole pie. On my more recent visit, my husband and I got a large cheese pizza. This, to me, is the True test of a pizzeria. As soon as the pizza came to the table, I noticed it smelled EXACTLY like tomato soup. After a few bites, I could confirm that the sauce indeed tastes basically like tomato soup: bland, sweetish, with almost no spice, texture, or flavor. It didn't even taste very much like tomato, just so bland. The crust was very good. I loved how it was thin without turning soggy or floppy, and it had an excellent crispness. Now, I don't mind a lightly cheesed pizza, but this cheese again had very little flavor. We had to dress the pizza up with way more crushed pepper, oregano, and parmesan than normal to give it any flavor. Normally when my husband and I order a large, were assuming we'll take home about half for lunch (or, let's be real, cold breakfast). This pie was so thin and light we polished the whole thing off, and were legitimately peckish a few hours later. So while $14 isn't exorbitant, it can certainly buy you more, better pizza elsewhere. I will say, the service was excellent. All the staff was super friendly, and seemed happy to be at work, which goes a long way. I'm giving 3 stars because of the great service and because the gourmet pies with toppings look like they'd be good.",

Through trial and error in the South Hills (Beto's, Bado's, A Pizza B'Adamo, Little Nippers, Fiori's), Slice was recommended to my husband. We went during the week and were pleasantly surprised.   When in Carnegie, it is easy to drive by as it is a small location. You order and pay at the counter. There are about 5-6 tables in the restaurant. It is also BYOB, however they only provide plastic cups, which didn't bother us at all.   Since it was our first visit, we ordered and eight cut pizza. You can order \"jumbo slices\"  and various rolls (pepperoni, spinach, meatballs, etc) at the counter. The wait was a little long but the staff was incredibly helpful when ordering and pleasant to all customers.   The pizza was beautifully tossed: thin all around except the robust crust. The sauce was not too sweet and balance with a perfect amount of cheese. We will absolutely be back. This is our new favorite pizza place!  As we were leaving, the place was filling up!!!",

What appeared to be the meat lover's was really loaded up- including actual slices of bacon, not bacon bits. Not sure that I've ever seen that on a Pie before. I am sad that I live just a few miles outside of their delivery area.",

Looking forward to trying other things but if you want a really good crispy crust pizza give this",

    "text": "It's pretty good.  I'll try again, but here's my first take, based on a traditional, giant pepperoni pizza:  - The pizza is a proper, New York style.  The dough/crust is fairly thin, but flexible, with just a slight crispiness to the bottom surface of the crust, again, very much New York style.  - The crust itself tastes great.  It's just a little bit sweet, but mostly savory, and has enough flavor to eat on its own.  - The sauce was a little too skimpy, not special, and maybe even a touch too sweet.  Maybe this is my personal bias, but I like to see and taste a bit more sauce.  - Pepperoni toppings were decent, pretty standard in size and thickness, leaving a bit of grease up on top (which is fine - this is what baked pepperonis do).  - The cheese is good, with light-to-medium weight.  It's not an overly cheesy pizza.  Overall, it balances well and tastes quite good.  It's also thin and light, so you may eat a few more slices of this pizza than you would of others.  Service is nice and the pizza (got carry-out, not delivery) was piping hot and baked right (not too baked, not under baked).  So I'll try them again, but I'm just a little under-whelmed.  Again, it's quite good, but not 4-stars, just a bit too regular.",

    "text": "I stopped here with my family and was very pleased. Walking down the street we looked at a couple of restaurants, and ended up choosing Slice On Broadway as our pizza place. We were not disappointed!  We ordered a supreme pizza. We ended up getting the largest pizza possible. Between the 5 of us (5 grown adults) we still have over 1/4 of the pizza left at the end. We didn't finish it because we were so full! We made sure that we took the rest to go.  We got an \"appetizer\" of garlic knots. They were basically pizza dough tied into knots, but we did (k)not regret ordering them. They had great flavor and we loved the sauce to dip them in.  I would definitely come back to either eat in or get an order to go!",

    "text": "Wow. First of all, when I walked in, I immediately saw all of these amazing pizzas. I had a hard time deciding which to order because they are massive slices (as big as my head), so realistically I could only eat one. I chose well because the 5 cheese pizza was one of the best pieces of pizzas I've ever eaten. I'd compare it to pizza I've had at fancy Italian restaurants, except it was way cheaper. It was that good. The slices are huge and packed with delicious toppings, in my case-5 cheeses. The crust is thin and crispy. They have several locations, and one that will deliver to my office in Green Tree. I will most definitely be back to try the buffalo chicken and barbecue chicken pizzas. They looked so good!",

The guys are extremely friendly and accommodating when you dine in. Their delivery is always fast and the food is hot. What I really like is that they are consistent in the way their food tastes and use quality ingredients. My favorite pizzas are the Margarita and Lasagna pizza. I also like their pepperoni rolls, their salads are good quality lettuce and veggies and their homemade dressings taste just like that....homemade! If you haven't tried one of their 3 locations (one at PNC Park now), definitely give it a whirl; you won't be disappointed.",

While there was an error between the systems once we got our food, and it was incorrect- the people at Slice resolved the issue in a friendly and prompt manner. The management was apologetic and kind. Once we started on the food, we were wowed by the flavor. the pizza was warm and the portions are generous.   It wasn't Slice's error, but the system. The people at Slice  were willing to remake the pizza and didn't give me a hard time or bore us with technical details as to why the order system had failed. We picked up the pizza ourselves which was ready within 15 minutes of our call. Great customer service!",

The Green Monster is a favorite, along with the Capricciosa (add banana peppers). The pesto sauce is SO GOOD. The crust is perfect, crispy with the perfect amount of chewiness. The hoagies are good too, though I usually go for the pizza. The four stars are due to the continually terrible time estimate - several times I've shown up at the estimated time and they are just adding toppings to the pizza and getting it ready for the oven. Once, I waited 30 minutes after arriving for my pizza. However, I will continue being a patron of Slice as the quality of pizza is so great.",
