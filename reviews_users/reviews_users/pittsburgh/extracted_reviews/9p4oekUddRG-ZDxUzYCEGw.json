We went Saturday morning so it was crowded but we were seated immediately by a very overworked gentleman. The host clearly needed some help and another waitress would really improve the time waiting. We got our food quickly and thankfully everything was fine as it was because we had to wait a long time to get our check. This is probably my biggest pet peeve when it comes to service. They had run out of silverware and our waitress was either making toast or on her phone for 5 minutes while we waited for the check. I would probably go back again but at off peak times. Great food but the service isn't the best.",

Again, the eggs were fluffy and the pancakes were cooked perfectly and loaded with bananas and pecans.  Both meals came with Homefries, which were just ok: some of the potatoes weren't cooked all the way through and some tasted of old \"grease.\"  The service was prompt and very friendly; and the coffee was hot and fresh.

The home fries are almost as good as Pamela's Diner (in the strip). The breakfast sandwich, however, is my fave!! I actually become sad when it's time to take my last bite. Gotta try this place for breakfast. It's a diner, not a 5 star restaurant. Keep that in mind when visiting. It's not going to have matching linens, plates, and chandeliers, like some people would want. Go to the Grand Concourse for Sunday brunch with Bloody Marys and mimosas. Good home style cooking with good people surrounding you.",

Okay, let's get talking about Bob's, good coffee, that's what I judge a diner by, and Bob's has some good Joe. I had an egg white omelet with peppers, onions, and shrooms, whole wheat toast, and fresh fruit. The fruit was fresh sliced, mostly melon, nice and fresh. The toast was perfectly lite brown and the eggs were cooked through and benefitted from a few dashes of salt and pepper. The vegetables were cooked through. All and all a good meal. Next time I will ask if they make an oatmeal pancake or buck wheat and give them a try.",

One person ordered a Belgian waffle (after being told that breakfast was served all day). The waitress returned to tell us that the waffle iron had been turned off at 2:00. Another person ordered a fish sandwich. Again the waitress returned to say that no one had bothered to bread the fish that day. So there was no fish.I ordered a \"Rachel\"...turkey, Russian dressing, cole slaw. The sandwich was so soggy that it could have floated away. I did not eat even half of it.The pickle on the side had seen better days. My husband ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich. The tomato slice on the sandwich was face down. When it was turned over it was black and not edible.   The meals are not inexpensive. Our bill for two sandwiches amounted to $20 plus a tip. It will be a long time before we return.

I wish I could give it more than two stars but the inconsistency in the preparation of the food (same item prepared different every time) and the Walmart type atmosphere make it hard to do so. The food, service and price is exactly as what should be expected. The food is decent but nothing remarkable. The service is what it is. Overall there is no reason to cross this place off your list. You will find something you can live with. The food arrives fairly fast. The price is not out of line with other restaurants of this caliber. The bottom line is Bob's will not be your \" go to\" place but it is a place you can go to. For me it will be an every few months experience.",

    "text": "After hearing good things about Bob's Diner, my wife and I decided to visit for an early dinner after attending the Pittsburgh Pirates game of Wednesday, 7 May 2014.    We were immediately greeted by two delightful and friendly people, including the lady who would be our server and a gentleman who apparently works in the kitchen.  They engaged us in pleasant conversation about the game and immediately established rapport, making us feel welcome.  My wife ordered liver and onions, which came with homemade mashed potatoes and fresh green beans.  I had a reuben sandwich, which came with bagged chips. We were brought two large slices of fresh Italian bread and soft butter. We shared an order of onion rings for an appetizer. The portion sizes were standard.  All of our food was delicious.  My sandwich was served on a nice marble rye bread.  The bagged chips meant nothing to me as this is something that I can have at home.   Eat 'n Park serves excellent homemade chips with its sandwiches and entrees. Although we did not have dessert, they looked good and I was impressed to see an old-fashioned milkshake machine.  Throughout the meal, our server was efficient and gracious, performing a quality check.  With early bird $1.00 discounts and a $1.00 coupon, our total tariff came to just over $20, a bargain for all of the good food that we enjoyed.  The downside of the restaurant is that it is old, old, old: badly in need of renovation and style. Unlike Bob's Diner in Carnegie, Eat 'n Park offers modern, bright, cheerful, attractive restaurants.  If Bob's would adopt a similar strategy, it would be a place that I would be anxious to visit again.  As it stands, I would not go out of the way to dine there again.  The restaurant is to open a new location in my community of Upper Saint Clair soon in an area in which a number of restaurants have failed.  I hope that this new location will be a modern, bright, uplifting facility, and that it will succeed.",

The waitress was nice enough once someone waited on me but that took a bit as they were arguing about who was off and wasn't. You would have thought it was near closing time. Also the outside sign lured me in with pumpkin specials and there wasn't a pumpkin item to be had.",

I like breakfast and they serve a good one :-).   I chose to sit at the counter (due to there were no open tables) and felt sorry for the waitress.    The diner was so crowded (due to the good service / food) that the servers had to orchestrate Cirque du Soliel movements behind the counter with large platters of food.  The food was very good and as Leah mentioned earlier (at a reasonable price).  I will be back!  Food - $8  Service - Great - The waitress was friendly even though she was busy. Atmosphere - Very busy - but still pretty clean considering the foot traffic.  Please note the parking lot was full when I arrived.   This will be your biggest obstacle to a great breakfast!",

After waiting 15 minutes, no server came by our table, we left. Told the girl that seated us we never got waited on, her reply was \"really\". It's a shame this location has such bad service, the other,locations are way better. I am not basing my opinion on this one bad experience, have been going to this location since it opened. Have had many dinners accompanied by really bad service. Unfortunately, this one will be the last one for me.",

    "text": "I was apartment searching in Carnegie on Good Friday since I had off work. I've been searching Craiglist but sometimes you're lucky enough to find a \"for rent\" sign on a great apt that isn't listed on craigslist. I didnt really have luck, but i worked up an appetite.   I had passed a few places in Carnegie to eat, but the words 'diner' really stuck out to me. Also, I noticed from the decal on the door that they took cards which was a plus. They had specials for Lent and the crab cake sandwich stuck out to me. I also took a look at their menu which wasnt bad at all.. usual diner fare.  The crabcake sandwich was satisfying and it came with a side of fries and cole slaw. The cole slaw was actually good. My mom is one of those people who wants hers to bathe in dressing. She wouldn't have liked Bob's but it had just the right amount in my opinion.  Service was okay. They were busy and you felt as if the server was rushed but that was fine.  I could agree with the other reviewers who mentioned the upholstered chairs that could use a good scrubbin (or just new ones) & that the food takes foreverrrrrr- hence the only 3 star review. However, an older gentleman stopped to ask how my meal was (the owner im assuming?) Afterwards he went back into the kitchen and i couldn't see/hear any other cooks, so im thinking he does it all on his own.. which would explain the wait times. I'll wait for an old sweetie to cook for food!   If i become lucky and find an apartment in downtown Carnegie, then I'll be back for some dinre fare.",

I'm not sure what other reviewers were raving about the home fries .  I was not too impressed with them, big chunks of redskin potatoes, no garlic or onions ( none that I could find anyways).    I tried the eggs Benedict on three different occasions and was disappointed in the hollandaise sauce.    Coffee was ok. The hash was also nothing special, I expected homemade cornbeef hash , but it was generic food service canned hash with a few peppers thrown in.    I really want to like this place, but nothing stands out. $7.95 for a basic breakfast is not a deal in pittsburgh. Many places have the 2 egg, meat, potatoes and toast for $3.99 weekdays.    My overall opinion is that I will still come here, but will  not go out of my way.",

Food came out quick, hot and with sizable portions. The hashbrowns were crispy, well seasoned. The pancake was fluffy and the size of the entire plate.

I got Bob's Breakfast - everything was seasoned and cooked well & I loved the option of buttered rye toast on the side. I also loved that I could get grilled hot sausage as my protein- it was delicious! The potatoes could use a bit more seasoning, but all in all a good meal!   My boyfriend was doing backflips over his breakfast. He got the strawberry French toast and didn't speak to me the entire time - he hardly took breaths. He said it was one of the best he's ever had.  I really like that they have a large variety of dishes, even some that are for the health conscious which I can appreciate & will try out next time.   Our waitress was super friendly and on top of everything. We didn't wait long to pay for our bill at the checkout either.   We will definitely be back! Check this place out!!",

My breakfasts have included an enormous pile of strawberry French toast complete with syrup, whipped cream, and strawberry filling. During other visits later in the day, I've gone for salads or sandwiches. Everything has always been delicious - always fresh, always served quickly, and always served hot (well, except for the salad greens!).  The diner itself is pretty cozy; in fact paying before leaving can admittedly take some time if the place is busy, as you have to wait for someone to come to the register and check you out. But that's pretty much the only drawback I've come across at Bob's so far. Hopefully I have a chance to come back and sample a little more of their menu soon!",

I ordered a turkey sandwich with cheddar my wife ordered the eggs benedict and our daughter ordered the chicken tenders with fries. The sandwich itself was good however the fries were mediocre-at-best I tasted some of my wife's food and the potatoes were not good nor was the eggs benedict my daughter's chicken tenders were okay but then again they are chicken tenders. Service was pretty good prices were good as well however I 3 star rating means I'll be back and I would not go back to this particular location thus it gets two stars.",

    "text": "We have been here a few times, and while the food still isn't quite as good as the Painter's Run location, my wife and I really enjoy it. The atmosphere is always busy and provides plenty of people watching. I ordered an omelet with swiss, ham, mushroom and tomato, and it was a lot greasier than usual, but still good. My wife always orders poached eggs, well done, and for some reason they always come out runny. This time, they were perfect.   Also, it's worth mentioning that Bob's is one of the few diners in the area that offers fruit, as a side and a fruit plate. The plate is huge, enough for two people, at least. And it's freshly cut.  If you want a local greasy breakfast diner, you'd be hard pressed to find a better spot than Bob's.",

Overall I would say for the type of restaurant and price the food was very good. The staff was nice, and you can't really beat the prices. I would definitely come back for a casual yummy breakfast.",

Our dinners were all delicious!  (Between all of us, we ordered a Reuben with onion rings, a chop steak dinner with mashed potatoes & veggies,  and 2 pot roast specials.)  The only reason for 4 stars is that for 4 of us it was really pricey for a diner. With tip, we spent just over $100.   I will definitely return though and try something else on their extensive menu. Hopefully next time everything will be just as tasty before!",

Asked for a side of eggs and toast, and she recommended a style of toast (can't remember what it's called) that's really popular in Pittsburgh, so I went with that, and wow it was great! I can't say enough about her. The food was so good, service was outstanding. Definitely a place I'd recommend!",

    "text": "Bob's is on an upswing! We are regulars and eleven months ago I wrote a negative review...in here to say we have seen great improvements. The food seems to be better prepared--and better presented. The wait staff has changed a bit and it seems--at least from our vantage point--they are working together more as a \"team\" now. The waitresses in the evening are AWESOME and from what we've seen the few times we have been there for breakfasts--everyone is great. The home made soups are especially delicious--as is Bob's chili! It would be great to see a few daily or weekly menu features--as the usual menu items--although mostly delicious--are a bit tiresome. I bet Tacos would be great on Tuesdays--along with the usual Turkey! You could retire the Barbecue sandwich--we were disappointed because it seemed to be made with bologna rather than Isaly's Chipped ham! Not good! How about a meatloaf dinner? With mashed potatoes, gravy and coleslaw? Yum! Anyway--keep up the great work--Bob's is a great little diner we love!!!",

The eggs Benedict didn't have a lot of flavor, the pancake was chewy & the egg sandwich was kind of greasy. Wasn't the worst diner food I've had however isn't worth going back. There are much better diners around the city.  Service was ok, waitress was friendly & prices are decent. The diner wasn't dirty but yet didn't feel really clean either.",

Sometimes they were a bit overwhelmed with how many pinball folks came in each morning but it's got a nice small town vibe and I enjoyed listening to the wait staff gossip :)",
