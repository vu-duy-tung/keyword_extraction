We finally decided to stop in for lunch a couple Saturdays ago and were not disappointed!  The food was surprisingly excellent and the staff was extremely friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately, the upstairs (where most of the games are) was not open at the time, but we still stayed for a good two hours playing the games on the main floor.  We did find it somewhat alarming that the place was so dead.  This place is a charming little hole in the wall and I hope that it can manage to stay in business.  Even if you don't care for pinball, at least come for the panini!  I think the upstairs is open by now so the PIC and I will be back soon!  PS - Get a Medieval Madness machine and the PIC and I will personally keep you in business!",

There were a dozen machines, ranging from the 1950's and 1960's to more recent (my mom preferred the older ones since you can \"get more physical\" with them - I had no idea she was such a wizard). There was even a game that one of the owners built from scratch! Delicious lattes, custom painted floors, and retro seating areas just added to the experience. I definitely wish there was a coffee shop like this on the West Coast. I'd be a regular here if I was local.",

I like that they have added something in Lawrenceville like this, especially for my friends who are no longer drinkers or they are teetotalers.  I did not get a chance to eat there since we had already had dinner, but the sandwiches smelled like heavenly grilled sammies!  I was a little underwhelmed with the amount of machines they had.  It looked so much more robust from the pictures on line.  However, they did have a nice selection of games.  Not being the pinball wizard like cousin Pete, I am relying on his opinion here!  I like the set up, location and the fact that it has a small menu and it is byob.  This is a nice option to just a bar/restaurant.  The day we were there, it seemed as if 2 or 3 of the machines weren't accepting coins correctly, or you put in your coins and then it wouldn't turn on and you had to get refunded.  I hope they can keep the machines serviced well and maybe putting a sign on the machine if several people upstairs are coming down to get a refund.  I will try it out again with my nephews and hope that these kinks are worked out.",

You get to play pinball games. The floor is a giant mural that lights up like you are walking inside a pinball machine.    There is going to be an arcade with more pinball machines opening upstairs, it's in a cool neighborhood, and the coffee was good.  I had a fancy salad that was good too.  One other thing -- kids love the games, but some of the artwork is a bit on the mature side.  Check out the photos to see if that sort of thing is an issue for you, or just stick with the Addams Family and other licensed games.",

As I was walking through Lawrenceville I noticed this place with pinball machines and a pinball theme and had to check it out.  Ordered a sandwich and played a few games.  The sandwich was most excellent as was the pinball.  The games all worked great and the re-themed EM pins were really cool and a lot of fun.  The only drawbacks were that it was absolutely dead on a saturday afternoon when I would expect there to be a few people hanging around and having a nice lunch, and it's almost so well done inside that it feels uncomfortable hanging about.  I think this needs a little more of the neighborhood dive feel to it to be honest.  I feel bad saying that as it was clearly a lot of work to construct and very well done.",

Having a dedicated location for it is wonderful.   No idea what someone said about the byob price being high, it's two bucks per person that's nothing.   A few of the machines were out of order but that's to be expected with how difficult to maintain pinball machines are.   The payrange app is nice for the fancier machines.   Will absolutely be back again and again.",

This time I came to hang out and to use the free interwebz. My fiance is in love with their coffee so he came along with me. He got a latte and I was really excited to try the raspberry lemonade. The barista even allowed me to have a pre-taste to see if I would like it. Lemonade is something that could be so many things, sour, too sweet, tart, etc. This blend of fresh squeezed fruit was perfect. Not to sweet, not to sour, perfect. Christopher's latte was also delicious. I am not the biggest coffee fan, but this one was pretty good!   Now, why I came to the cafe was to use the internet. It worked, which is a good thing, but there were not many tables/comfortable places to sit and to work. It was also really loud with the pinball machines. Not the most productive place to sit and work. I got done what I needed but I would not recommend coming here to work.   The pinball machines were also wonderful. It is a really nice place to come and hang out and maybe have fun with friends. It was more a hang out place than a get work done place.   I would go back, but not to work!",

Each game is pretty affordable too.   Their selection changes from what I understand. A few tables I saw last included The Walking Dead, Medieval Madness and several fantastic other tables.   The drink selection here is nice, and whoever made my mocha did an excellent job. The drinks are affordable, too, so that's an added bonus. You won't see Starbucks prices here.   Kickback has an excellent vibe to destress and have fun. Whether you want to game for hours, a few minutes or chill with a group of friends, this is the right environment for that.  I look forward to spending much more time here in the future and snagging one of their sexy t-shirts.",

Yes, there are a lot of pinball machines from different eras but quite a few of them were out of order. I'm not sure if they simply didn't have enough outlets or the machines needed maintenance but either way I felt the selection was lacking. The other problem with this place is that it's too sterile. The place was entirely too quiet and didn't seem to have much soul. This place could benefit from having some live music or at the very least some sort of stereo system playing an ipod throughout the establishment. I would also hope they're applying for some sort of liquor license as this place definitely needs to start serving cocktails and beer. All-in-all I would give this place a 2.5 but there is definitely potential!  Quick Tip: Buy your booze ahead of time as this place is BYOB but the nearest wine store is a few blocks away.

    "text": "I have stopped by here twice now in the past couple of weeks.  The first time was on a Saturday morning with my fiance for coffee and the last time was on a Wednesday for lunch with my father.  Both times there hasn't been many people in the cafe which I find to be a shame.  The inside of the restaurant is decorated whimsically as the floor is painted like the bottom of the pinball machine while the tables are made to look like bumpers.  Besides all of that there are about 5 pinball machines with 2 of them being newer and 3 being of the older type.  Whenever I stopped by with my fiance, I ordered an Americano as did she.  The coffee was smooth and ended up tasting good without too much bitterness which I enjoyed.  We also bought $1 worth of tokens (its frustrating to me that they don't allow quarters) and played the Adams Family pinball game which we both enjoyed.  Whenever I went with my father I ended up ordering the squealer for lunch which consisted of ham, mustard, rosemary and I forget what else that came out on a 6\"(?) bun pressed like a panini,  I really enjoyed the taste of my sandwich, especially the subtle rosemary hints at the end.  While both my dad and I thought our respective sandwiches were good, sadly neither one of us thought that the sandwich was big enough to be a full lunch, much less justify the price that we paid.  Due to that we ended up stopping at a Wendys on the way home.  Even so my dad and I ended up enjoying ourselves after spending about $5 on pinball (Addam's Family and Terminator 3) which is the real reason that we came.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here again in the future.  While I do not imagine that I would eat here again due to the high cost versus amount of food given, I did enjoy what I had eaten and can really see myself stopping here on leisurely Saturday morning for a Americano and game of pinball.",

    "text": "Even if you are not into pinball, Kickback is a nice place to stop.  The sandwiches, coffee, and other beverages are all reasonably priced and decent quality. The food servings are on the small side, so you might not get completely full eating here, but if you're just stopping for a quick bite or snack, then that's fine.  They have a limited amount of tables, so if you are there to eat on a busy evening, you may not be able to find a seat.  The staff are all friendly and seem knowledgeable about coffee, pinball, and other local hangouts.  They usually have a handful of machines downstairs and a lot more upstairs. The variety of machines is good and rotates regularly, but I've never seen every machine full operational at the same time. At any given time, 30-50% of the machines are out of order or not working properly.  Kickback is now BYOB, which is great, but the cost to B your own B is pretty high. I brought a six-pack of beer in and was told it would be $1 a beer. $6 on top of the original cost of the six-pack is a lot more than I want to spend. Other BYOB places usually have a smaller fee.  Overall, Kickback is a pretty great place. I've been here many times and plan to keep on going. I'd recommend it to anybody looking to grab a quick coffee, or looking to waste a couple of hours playing pinball.",

Prices to play are reasonable, and with only one exception, the machines I enjoyed were in very good working order.

I didn't get a chance to grab a drink because I was in & out relatively fast, but I was able to play a game or two of pinball after having dinner & drinks at Condado. This place is one of a kind, and I think it would be a perfect date spot!   There are about 20-30 pinball machines in the entire place. There's an upstairs and a downstairs; downstairs you order something from the cafe, and upstairs you can play as many games of pinball as you'd like. They have a money machine that converts dollars into tokens, and you're set from there.   Next time I'm going to make sure to grab a drink so I can do a full review, but as far as I'm concerned, I would come back here just for the pinball! I had an awesome time here with a few friends, and I'm really excited to show other people about this place.",

It's never been super crowded when I have been there so you'll never really have to wait long to get your food.

So for my daughters 8th birthday she chose the Kickback Cafe.  We went for the pinball but then we got hungry.  Instead of going to eat elsewhere we gave them a shot.  And all 3 of us were surprised. The sandwiches were terrific.  And very affordable.(plus you get a giant pickle)   And the guy working was very easy going and allowed my kids to alter their sandwiches to fit their picky needs.  Another bonus was with no smoking or alcohol sales they were allowed to stay past 9pm.  Every machine was in service and worked like new.  If you Truely love pinball machines its got some of the classics. Plus a few new ones.  They don't have a ton of machines.  But the ones they have are worth the trip.  The food was a nice bonus.  In all it was a $30 night out with the kids.  Cant beat that.",

The sidewalk sign mentioning coffee & tea caught my eye, as I didn't know there was a coffee shop in this spot of Lawrenceville. That's when I looked to my left, and saw a beautiful sight... pinball machines. I obviously had to go inside. I ordered an iced red raspberry tea, which was delicious. I sipped on the tasty tea while I played various pinball games including Creature of the Black Lagoon, Iron Man, Family Guy, Twilight Zone, an old school Monster one and a vintage pinball game that looked like it was from the 60s or 70s. You must use tokens to play the games, which you purchase from the front counter. I had a blast playing the games and drinking my delicious iced tea. Not only is this place super cool, but the woman working behind the counter was SO NICE. Amazing customer service.  I had no idea a cafe like this existed in Pittsburgh and now I am greatly anticipating my next return!",

    "text": "First of all, I like how Pittsburgh keeps on surprising me.  I had no clue that Pittsburgh had a pinball cafe and would have never known if someone else told me about it.    This space is fun.  It's got the old school arcade vibe mixing with a chill cafe/work space vibe.  Walking in you kind of think to yourself that there aren't many pinball machines, but then you notice stairs that lead up to a loft area.  Tokens can be obtained at the counter or upstairs at a change machine.  One token equals one quarter, but you MUST have tokens because that is only what the machines take.  When you walk upstairs it's kind of an amazing sight.  Nearly a dozen pinball machines line the walls as you first walk up there.  Towards the front of the building is a loft opening that looks down unto the first floor.  On the other side of the opening is more seating if you would prefer to dine or work up here.    When we were here, it was a bit warm, but not overbearing.  Some of the machines were down for repair, but a majority of them are in great working order, especially given the age of some of them.  Be careful with some of the machines, they will gobble up your tokens, but not register.  What you will notice is there is a whiteboard in the upstairs area that you can leave suggestions/complaints on to address any certain machine.  Food and drink are available for purchase in here, but I did not partake in either.  It is a fun place to spend some time and one I will probably return to in the near future.",
