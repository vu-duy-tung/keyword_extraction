The food was the best Mediterranean food I ever had. Had planned to have baklava in the desert but couldn't eat a morsel more. Though intend to go back soon to have that too!! The waiters were very eager to serve and as we weren't able to decide what to order, just followed their suggestions, and man we weren't disappointed!!   Definitely a must recommend!!!",

    "text": "First stop to this little place. As always I'm drawn to outdoor seating. Pittsburgh may only have a short guaranteed 3 months of good outdoor seating, and this place has a pretty good amount compared to rest of the city.  My friend and I shared two apps and an entree. Plenty of food for the two of us. Hummus, stuffed grape leaves and a mixed grill.  Hummus was smooth with great flavor of the chick peas. I really hate the supermarket stuff as its overloaded with acid and takes that nutty flavor away. Fresh warm pita sever at the table to accompany.  Grape leaves. I'm sooooooo picky about these. Having a great recipe that I use from a very loving YaYa friend of the family, I'm weary to search out a comparison. What I do know is the time and painstaking love it takes to make them. These are stuffed with rice, no meat. Most often when I find these somewhere they are soggy, oil laden and just not good. Istanbul's are really fresh. 5 to an order. Rice is not mushy. You can tell they are made in small batches and often.  Mixed grill was good as well.  Served with rice and fresh cabbage slaw and grilled pepper.  Corking fee...$2!! Whaaaat? Amazingly reasonable.  Service was excellent as well.  I will definitely be returning to check out more menu offerings including some dessert and Turkish coffee.",

    "text": "We went here yesterday. Let me start with the things I really liked about this place: We ordered Kunefa and Kazandibi for dessert. That was the best thing in this meal. I really liked the kazandibi. I have had better kunefa elsewhere before but this was good enough. It took them 15 minutes to prepare it but it was wort the wait. The other things we ordered were Chicken adana, lentil soup, Manti(Vegetarian) and Karniyarik. These were fine. Adana was pretty juicy. This place was pretty crowded on a Sunday evening and they have live music and outside seating.  The few things I didn't enjoy so much: The live music was too loud since space is limited and the performers were too close to our table. The table we were seated at was continuously wobbling from side to side. Also, they offer 1 free wine with every entree when you check in on yelp. My boyfriend checked in and requested for his wine. The waitress however clicked something on his phone and the offer was marked as used. Then she never brought him his wine. I too had checked in but noticing her behavior I lost interest in asking her for mine. It may be a communication gap due to language but it felt like they avoided it intentionally and it felt a bit rude. Also the server's were super busy since the place was crowded and we felt a bit neglected. Food is not bad and it's worth going here at least once if you stay in pittsburgh. However my experience wasn't too nice and I may not go back again.",

The texture was perfect and it was so flavorful.  For dinner my friend and I split the Sofra Mixed Grill that contained a combo of their lamb and chicken dishes.  We loved everything!  I got a free baklava for checking in on Yelp and I think it may be the best baklava I have ever had.  It was so light and flaky with the perfect amount of delicious honey drizzled on top.  They don't serve alcohol but it is BYOB.  I had the Turkish tea, which was a black tea that was quite good.  The service was also excellent and the owner even came over to see how we were doing. I loved the cozy decor with the beautiful handmade colored lamps everywhere.  I asked the owner about them and he said it is his family business and gave me his card!  I think I may order one of those lamps.  The prices are also very reasonable.",

The waiter was sooo friendly, and the owner really did a fantastic job of going around and making sure everybody was happy.  Admittedly, we had a reservation and had to wait a bit before it was actually ready, but the owner made sure to personally apologize and explain the delay to us.  Later, he came over and talked to us about travel... Long story short, you don't find this kind of service often!  As for the food itself, I think they serve the BEST baklava I've ever had (\"better than any of the baklava in Greece or Turkey or anywhere else in the Mediterranean that we tried\", according to one of the other members of my group), and the rest of the food is AMAZING as well.  UPDATE: I've now come here several times (basically every time I come to Pittsburgh) and I've gotten used to just ordering a whole bunch of appetizers for my meal so that I can try a little bit of everything since everything is delicious.  Highly recommend!  This is definitely my favorite Mediterranean restaurant!",

My favorite dish was Mixed Cold Appetizers- we opted for the small combinations, and next time I go, I will get the large! I think it came with the Hummus, Spicy Ezme Salad, Mixed Eggplant, Piyaz, and the Baba Ghanoush. We also got the Eggplant Spread separately because a friend loved it so much the last time we were there. All the pieces were refreshing, I would love to make a meal out of the mixed appetizers alone!  We also got a Falafel Platter and the Lamb Mix Grill. I would say that the falafels were my least favorite- they were a little tough and dry. The Lamb Mix Grill was very good- some preparations better than others (loved the Kofte, but pretty disappointed in the Lamb Chops).  Overall, it was a nice experience with friendly service. I would love to go back and try all of the cold appetizers!",

Beautifully decorated restaurant, the red embroidered tablecloths, cloth embroidered menus, small mosaic pictures on the walls, the rugs, evil eyes, Turkish music, Turkish lamps and decorations, add to the appeal of this place. It feels small, and cozy.  This place only has lamb, chicken, shrimp, or salmon kebabs by the way. No beef at all.  The cold cubed fried eggplant appetizer was delicious. It was topped with a tomato sauce with a little garlic. Some of the pita was soft and warm, and some rather hard and crispy.  The mixed chicken plate was pretty good. The cubes of chicken, ground chicken patties were on top of a bed of long grained rice. There was half a grilled green pepper, shredded iceberg lettuce, red lettuce strips, a few halves of cherry tomatoes, and tzaziki sauce to pour over the chicken.   The salgam was a very tart, salty drink of reddish-purple color. Must be an acquired taste.  Service was excellent.  The rice pudding was thick, very creamy, very sweet with firm grains of rice. There was the faintest sprinkle of cinnamon on top. The more I ate, the more I liked it.",

    "text": "First time at a Turkish restaurant- I have only moved to Pittsburgh for a year- and I am kind of bitter of not having any authentic Persian food living in a larger American city... Anyway ventured here with my girlfriend to try and get as close to my natural cultural base of food as possible.  The restaurant has a pleasant ambience with covered outdoor area and and inner air conditioning-the manager was very pleasant coming out greeting us and trying to get to know us on a personal level. Told us about the loyalty program, and how you could win a free trip for two to Istanbul!!!- to me the most important thing about a restaurant is not what it currently is but what it's trying to be- I definitely got the idea that they were constantly trying to encourage feedback and communication with customers and improve.  The restaurant was clean- it was apparent they did a lot to give it the motto \"2 hours until Istanbul\"  the tables were covered with Turkish rug tapestry and menus were covered with it too- reminded me of Persian designs a lot!!  We got the inza salad and baba ganoush which tasted pretty good, the bread was fluffy and delicious!  For an entree we split the lamb kabob plate- it was not insanely plentiful in rice but it put the two of us at a good place! We left satisfied with our meal- the meats on the plate were spectacular! Juicy tender and cooked to perfection!!! My favorite were the kufta and adona kebab!!!   It got busy so it took them a little while to come and wrap up our experience , but no rush we were having a good time.   To wrap it up we had the baklava and black tea (another Persian similarity)- absolutely perfect ending to a delightful dining experience. Loved it here- will return!",

The patio is equally pleasant in the summer months. There are typical Turkish and Mediterranean appetizers, entrees, and desserts on the menu, and everything I've tried on multiple visits has been delicious. The prices are very reasonable for what you get.   But besides the great food and atmosphere, a visit to Istanbul Sofra will be truly memorable because of the exceptional service. The Turks are famous for their hospitality and that's demonstrated here by the owner and staff. As a guest you feel welcome and appreciated - more than just a paying customer but someone worth talking to and getting to know. The staff and management always seem to do a little extra to make the guests happy. There is even a customer loyalty program offering a chance to win a trip to Istanbul! I can definitely recommend this restaurant, especially if you want a unique and fun dining experience.",

I had falafel the first time and a vegetarian dumpling (manti) just this evening. I'll have to try the falafel again because it was somewhat dry my first time, but the manti were great and such a nice change from the usual veg fare. I commented on this to the owner and said I hadn't noticed them on our first visit; he explained that he had added them in response to learning that the east end has a large number of vegetarians. I was so impressed at the thought he had put into an admittedly small segment of the population :) Great little neighborhood place in this spot, finally!!

There is both indoors and outdoors sitting.

We got the small cold sampler, and while it states that it's Chef's choice they allowed us to substitute.  The hummus, baba ganouj, and tabouli were excellent.  They warm/grill the pita bread nicely; however, I am used to having freshly baked pita bread at the restaurants in Portland, Oregon, having lived there for many years, which is far superior.  I enjoyed the Kofte as well.  We definitely plan to return to try some of the other dishes.",

    "text": "Very cool little place. Intimate feel but a surprising amount of space and tables. I came with my brother for a weeknight dinner out. We didn't order appetizers or being drinks (it's Byob) but nonetheless had nice experience. Service was great. Food was just fine. I order a shrimp kabob plate. It came with rice and some pickled veggies. The shrimp was nicely cooked and seasoned but really nothing too special. There was a sauce that looked carefully put together but tasted like a light cocktail sauce which was weird. The rice was rice. The pickled veggies didn't seam to go with the rest of the plate but were good. My brother got basically the same plate but with chicken and some sort of white sauce instead of the cocktail sauce mimic.  We spent 40 bucks including a 25% tip (me and my brother are in theater so we always tip well because so many waiters are also artists of some type) so it is a very decently priced place but I was a bit disappointed. My parents had been several times before and loved it so I expected something better than ok. They've since said that what is really fantastic about the place is the lamb, so maybe me and my brother just ordered wrong.  I would not protest going back here, but I also won't suggest it next time I eat out with someone.",

My husband, a falafel enthusiast, was highly complimentary.  Sorry we didn't get the baklava....  Update later on - so, about 20 minutes after I wrote the first review, a guy showed up at my house and gave us baklava!!!!  That's just unreal (plus, it was really good).  Thanks!",

    "text": "EDIT: Not only is the food awful, but the owner is crazy. I've been harassed, insulted, and he's tried every trick in the book to have my review removed. Luckily, there's only so much he can do. Received a message from somebody else who was being harassed by this guy too, but, in her case, he had found her name from the credit card receipts and posted it here. This is completely unacceptable behavior. I've posted his first comment to me below, but there have been many re-writes since. Not only do I think you shouldn't eat there because the food is overpriced and bland, you shouldn't eat there because you're supporting a bully.    Original reply from the owner since he's changed it now:  \"I'm sorry we couldn't give your food expectation at Istanbul sofra. With all the respect you never dine in with us. Because we don't serve just falafel and yogurt sauce or just rice . Your past reviews you never had mediterrean or Turkish cuisine before . I understand didn't fit in your taste . And looks like all the restuarant doing terrible job because all the restuarant you have reviewed 1 or 2 star.our act is already together. I just like to confirm that. We serve more than falafel sauce An it's Tabouli. start to appreciate some of the small restuarants. They all not 1 or 1 .Regards \"  Original Review:  The atmosphere is lovely and the location is great. Everything good ends there.  I got the falafel platter and tabbouleh with a side of the yogurt sauce.   Where to start... So, the falafel itself had absolutely no flavor and was super hard until you got a fork through it and it fell apart. Very odd. When I say no flavor, I mean \"nothing\". I didn't know this was even possible.   So, I went to layer on the tahini sauce, only to discover that it was too runny and also had no real flavor. It was like juice more than sauce.   So, I tried the yogurt sauce. I'm halfway convinced that they used a very diluted ranch dressing - you know, the kind you get in a place that's trying to cut costs. At least it had some sort of tangy runny flavor, but still very disappointing.   The rice was overcooked and hard and the tabbouleh was just as bland as the rest. The tomatoes had no flavor (come on, it's summer!) and there was no lemony tang or, really, anything. It was just kind of there.   Even the pickled vegetables that were on the side was tasteless.  I actually started to think that maybe something was wrong with my tastebuds since it all just tasted like cardboard to me. But, my dining partner had the same experience.   The service was okay, but not great. I really hope they get their act together. It's a great spot and I'd like to have something enjoyable there,.",

    "text": "I am no expert when it comes to Turkish food but I will say this is probably some of the best in Pittsburgh!  When you first walk in you can't help but notice the atmosphere and ambiance. There are many little details that make you feel right at home (a Turkish home.) From the decor to the lighting to the people working, you almost feel as if you are no longer in Pittsburgh!   I spent an hour on yelp prior to going just so I had an idea of what I wanted to eat when I arrived. Once I got there and started looking at everyone else's food I got thrown in a loop, everything looked so delicious!   I decided to get the baba ganoush to start off with. It came out picture perfect with some of the best pita bread I have ever had. It was warm, moist and an absolutely perfect combination with the baba ganoush. I was also offered a free glass of wine after I checked in so be sure to take advantage of that!   As for my meal I decided to get the mixed hot grill appetizer. It was exactly what I wanted! Everything was so delicious and some of the items were completely new to me. I also picked at some other food off of the plates of the people I was with. I tried a chicken Mediterranean salad and lamb shanks. Everything, again, was incredible.   At the end of my meal I ordered a Turkish coffee (I've heard so many amazing things about it) and the baklava dessert. The coffee came out in a tiny cup and was packed full of flavor. I had her add a dash of cream and sugar during the brewing process since you cannot do so afterwards (it is very small, sprt of like an espresso) the coffee came with 2 turkish delights which left my taste buds dancing in my mouth! Now for the Baklava, OH MY GOD!!! it was hands down some of the best I have ever had. It was melt in your mouth amazing!!! I would simply go back just for the coffee, turkish delights and baklava!   Overall I was blown away by this place. The owners were walking around making sure everything was perfect. The servers were tentative, kind and very professional. I honestly have nothing even neutral to say about this place. 5 stars across the board. Will definitely be returning!",

Everything from the  colorful interior to the outdoor seating filled with plenty of colorful flowers it is really aesthetically pleasing.   My mom and I were warmly greeted by the owner which was nice for a change! We started off with stuffed grape leaves and for our entrees we both got the Shish kabobs ($17) that came with rice and grilled vegetables. We both really enjoyed the flavor of the shish kabob and I also thought the rice had a lot of flavor as well. The kabobs were diced into pretty generous sizes; not to big and not to small. I definitely think you get your money's worth out of this meal.   Overall, the food and service was pretty wonderful! If you are looking for a good Turkish dining spot look no further and go to Istanbul Sofra.",

I didn't like the manti: too much dough, too little filling, bland tomato sauce. My father didn't like the texture of his chicken kofte--but I'm eating the rest of it at home right now, and I think it's delicious.  Went back and want to update my review: six of us ate a variety of appetizers and entrees, both meat and vegetarian. All of them were delicious. The hummus comes with pita refills, and the kebab entrees are really big enough for two. We did have to flag down a waitress to order apps while waiting for our whole party to arrive, and it seemed to take a while for the checks to come, but thankfully they did split the bill for us. We'll be back.",

Their service can be a bit slow sometimes but the food more than makes up for it. I usually go with a group so we can order their mix appetizer and mixed grill platters to share. All the dips in their cold appetizer platter are really good, plus the dips come with warm fluffy pita bread. Also, the lamb kebabs are very flavorful. Can't wait for the weather to warm up so I can go visit sofra again!",

We started with the mixed hot appetizers since it had items we've not tried before. Couldn't decide between lamb and chicken for entrees so we went with sharing the Sofra Mix Grill which had both. All of this was more than enough for the two of us. If this is your first time getting Turkish/Mediterranean food, you might want to take it easier because we cleaned our plates from hunger then regretted it after.  My friend has been to Turkey and really wanted apple tea, which they do not serve here...a small disappointment after all of his hype. We ordered Turkish tea instead, and it was strong and good nonetheless.   Decor is very nice and provides for a nice ambience.",

That being said, I love what the owners of the new Istanbul Sofra did with the place.  It is super cute in there, nicely set up to maximize seating (while not being on top of your neighboring tables).  The overall vibe in there is great.   Service was great too... Between the server and the owner maybe, we were very well attended to despite the fact that they had gotten quite busy.  We ordered the large cold appetizer platter which had everything on it... There wasn't a thing on it that I did not enjoy.  I ordered the Adana kebab for my meal. It was awesome.  Came on a bed of rice with a side of salad and some red cabbage (I think it was in vinegar and boy it was good too).  The hubby got the Iskander- I had a bite and it was good.  Judging by his clean plate- he enjoyed it too :) The 4 of us then split the 4 piece Baklava.  Best. Baklava. Ever. It had to be home made.    Such a great experience.  I left very happy and excited to return again soon.  I highly recommend this place!",

I often encounter very pleasant waiters/waitresses anyway, but he had a personable warmth and friendliness during my entire meal that went beyond that.  I came in for lunch at around 1:30, where it empty inside (6 or so tables outside were filled due to the good weather), and ordered the fried zucchini (mucver) patties and the kazandibi (milk pudding). Patties had a distinct zucchini taste and weren't at all oily. Also came with a cucumber yogurt sauce. I was also served a basket of pita bread - warm and soft.  The kazandibi came just as I was finishing, but Sercan also offered me the small glass of hot Turkish tea on the house, which I accepted. I think he said it was black tea, but it was more bitter than I expected (I usually take my tea without sugar or milk), although with sugar it had a nice taste that balanced out the sweet dessert.  I expected the kazandibi to have the soft jelly texture of creme brulee, but it was slightly stickier than that - appropriate as pudding I suppose. Still, very easy to cut through, with a creamy, milky taste. I think it definitely would have become too sweet without the tea, so I very much appreciate the level of service Sercan provided to make my meal as enjoyable as possible.  I will be back soon!",

Most of the dishes came with a delicious yellow rice (we now have a lot of rice left over). The portions are generous. My favourite dish was the lamb-stuffed eggplant. The babaganoush was also good, and a little on the lemony side but that was fine for me. The other dishes were a bit overcooked and dry (we also had them sitting out for a while bc it wasn't time for iftar yet so that might have been our fault a bit).",

They have plenty of seating for groups and even on a Saturday night, it wasn't too busy. Between the three of us, we ordered a Chicken Adana, Iskender Kebab, Manti entrees to share along with Turkish coffee and Ayran. As for the food, I wasn't too impressed considering the price that we paid for all three. Personally, I found the chicken seasoning to be just average ... nothing too special, probably cooked in a manner that I could probably replicate at home. I also found the tomato sauce in the Manti to be way too salty ... too much salt that overpowered even the flour in the Turkish dumplings contained in the dish. The lamb in the Iskender Kebab to be also pretty average ... a little on the dry side and having the same tomato sauce complimenting it that has the same problem as I mentioned earlier. As for the beverages, the Turkish coffee was pretty bitter but definitely on the strong side (though not as bitter as coffee made black) and the yogurt in the Ayran was overly milky ... One of the friends who came with me also was recently in Turkey and had tried all these dishes in the homeland. He also mentioned that the entrees weren't very authentic, especially when compared with similar counterparts back in Turkey. In short, quite the average joint for Turkish food. I was a little disappointed, but I also understand how hard it can be to have food here replicate the real deal.",

As a loyal person to the things I love and appreciate I will be coming here for the good stuff! Stars? Not sure if 7 are enough but I guarantee you that you will never go wrong coming here to celebrate life and special days in Istanbul w/ Adnan and his team. Again, thank you for making my birthday a memorable one!!

Everything from the hospitality (our waitress' name was Maya), the food, the fact that it is BYOB, and possibly one of the nicest restaurant owners I've ever met (Adnan aka Hilton). We had a group of 7 on a Saturday night, and although the restaurant seemed absolutely packed, they were able to seat us within 15-20 minutes, and all of our food/drinks were received in a very reasonable amount of time. The best dishes amongst the group were the hummus, the chicken kofte, the adana kebab, and the branzino. One tip - if you order the falafel appetizer, ask for the white yogurt sauce to supplement it. After our meal, Adnan came over and asked if we wanted dessert, but were stuffed and politely declined. However, he insisted and gave us 2 orders of baklava on the house, because he just wanted us to try it. I've had many baklavas so far, however, these were one of the best. The flakiness, the juice, the flavors - all amazing. To top it all off, Hilton then gave all of us a free \"I love Istanbul\" t-shirt and said, \"Many of our customers come back in the summer wearing these t-shirts!\" Expect us to be back, Adnan. Thank you for a great evening.",

Cold mixed app is the bomb, but definitely get extra pita bread.  Don't be shy.  Grape leaves are awesome, too.  I'm a fan of the chicken or beef/lamb kofte for a main dish.  The pickled red cabbage+homemade rice+perfectly seasoned meat? Oh, yes.  For dessert, they offer rum cake, milk pudding, baklava, and rice pudding (all only $5 each, and I mean it's like heaven).  All of the desserts are good, but the rice pudding.  Oh...I dream about this rice pudding.  I will eat at another restaurant and then come here just for rice pudding (did I mention it's BYOB?).  Baklava is super sweet, definitely a good shared dessert.  I mean they're all amazing.  The rice pudding is where it's at, though.  Try a Turkish tea or coffee with your dessert, too (definitely get it with sugar, though.  And don't drink the last bit of your Turkish coffee.. trust me).  The owner typically stops by your table to personally ask you if you like the food, which is a nice touch.  They just started delivering, too.  Minimum charge $15.  To those of you paying attention, that's 3 orders of rice pudding.  Yes.",

The food tasted pretty authentic, appetizer platter was flawless and the spinach borek probably the best I had in u.s. because it wasn't full of oil or thick phyllo.  Hunkar begendi on the specials menu - one of my favorites!  Quite well made.  Iskender was slightly dry and tasted slightly off to me but the sauce, bread and yogurt were great; still decent.  You'd have to wander off to upper nj / NYC or farther west to find much better turkish food.",

Decided to sit in the patio area under the awning but a brief thunderstorm with a torrential down pour tried to thwart our enjoyment of it, but the staff at Istanbul Sofra refused to let it.  The owner and his staff were very attentive to all the guests sitting outside during the storm and protected the food when it was coming out and tried to help all the drips and drops that were coming down from the awning.  But on to the food-I would give it a solid 4 stars for food.  We had the small appetizer sampler with hummus, baba ganoush, piyaz, and haydari (there may have been one more but I can't remember).  All were flavorful and fresh.  Folks have complained about the pita, but I thought it was good and served warm and they give you unlimited refills!  We shared the Sofra Mix Grill and the Shrimp Shish Kebab.  I'm not a huge fan of lamb but the lamb pieces in the Sofra Mix Grill were seasoned very well that I didn't mind eating a piece.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly, but I wished it had a bit more flavor.   For dessert we shared the Kazandibi (milk pudding with a caramalized sugar coating).  I'm a big fan of creme brulee so I thought there may be some similiarties.  Not really though but it was still good.  It's very rich, creamy and sweet and perfectly accompanies the somewhat bitter taste of Turkish coffee.  The coating is crispy like how it is in creme brulee and you can definitely taste the milkiness.  It was a perfect size to share with 3 people.    Overall, very pleased with this place, especially the customer service.  Will definitely check it out again, hopefully this time without a storm!",

Usually the problem I have with kofte is that it is overcooked. However, the five pieces of kofte I had here were very tender and seasoned really well. Highly recommend! However, boyfriend's lamb shank (which was a special that day) was just okay and tasted like it was just microwaved before being served. Although it was only $16, it came in a really small portion.

I ordered the babaganoush, a traditional eggplant puree with pita bread, that I devoured as my appetizer.

We ordered hummus, mixed hot grill appetizer and chicken kabobs. Our friends ordered lamb, falalfel, tabbouleh, and another chicken dish. Excellent presentation and prompt service. Did not know restaurant was byob as the yelp review offers free glass of wine with check-in (which they do honor but you can't purchase any wine) Next time will come prepared! Everyone enjoyed their food and we all agreed really fair prices.",

It's a BYOB place and it's not expensive. I enjoy that the staff is kind and they're very knowledgeable about the menu. My favorites were the rice pudding and the piyaz. I loved the piyaz so much that I went back for seconds. I learned a lot about Mediterranean food here. It was super flavorful and complex. Even the manager was pleasant. I can't wait to come back and try so much more from the menu here. Parking wasn't even an issue since it's super close to Frick Park. I have zero complaints as the food is not only flavorful but it doesn't make you feel super full after enjoying it. This place is a gem and I hope it never disappears.",

Honestly - the manager at Istanbul Sofra couldn't be any sweeter. He made us all feel like royalty, and seemed genuinely appreciative of the fact that his restaurant was chosen for a birthday celebration. Birthday gifts aside, the food here is amazing. I enjoyed a few grape leaves, some hummus and a lamb dish recommended by our server (and I was buyin' whatever he was sellin'). The moral of the story is, anything you get at I.S. is sure to be high-quality, delicious, and prepared with care. Enjoy!",

    "text": "Recently went to this place for the first time. It was a great experience! We went at 8pm on a Friday, and it was busy but not overcrowded. There is both indoor and outdoor seating - we opted to sit outside. The ambiance is really inviting and feels festive, with colorful string lights and decorations; plus, it's right across from Frick Park which makes for a nice view.   It is BYOB. We didn't realize this ahead of time, but I didn't miss having a drink at all because I was too focused on the amazing food. We started with the small cold appetizer platter, which has hummus, baba ghanoush, tabouli, haydari (a yogurt dip with spices) and a bean salad. It came with a basket of AMAZING fresh hot pita bread and they kept bringing us refills of pita bread throughout the meal. I highly recommend the appetizer platter - it was awesome to be able to try all of the different dips. My favorites were the baba ghanoush and the haydari, although all of them were fantastic. I could have eaten just this for my meal and been oh so happy.   For the entree, I ordered the doner kebab and my husband got the izgara kofte. The meat on my doner kebab was tender and well seasoned. It came with rice, a small salad and pickled cabbage (?) and peppers. The izgara kofte was patties of lamb and beef, also over rice with the same sides. I tried this and I have to say I liked it better than my meal, although both were delicious. The entrees are huge! I easily got two meals out of mine.   We got the baklava for dessert. It had a succulent glaze upon the delicate flaky layers which embedded a delicious nutty mix. That's a direct quote from my husband because I was too full to eat another bite at this point. You get four good-sized pieces of baklava for $6.  We went home with three big takeout boxes full of leftovers. The best part was that they gave us a whole new fresh box of pita bread to take home. A++. The service was very good, and the owner even came around while we were finishing to introduce himself and make sure we enjoyed our meal. I can't wait to go back.",

Service was bad, restaurant was almost empty and the waitress would disappear and forget about us. She didn't even ask us what to drink.  Restaurant owner/manager was very polite welcoming customers at the door.  My 2nd time here after I received an email from the owner apologizing and inviting me to visit again, so I stopped by for dinner during a visit to Pittsburgh, definitely better experience than first time, I ordered mixed meat platter, and finished it with delicious sweat, they served me hot tea free, good service.

    "text": "I stopped by Istanbul Sofra a couple of weekends ago with a friend.  We were cycling in Frick Park and were hungry for some dinner, so I suggested we stop by.  My friend had been before, but I hadn't, so I was eager to try it out, given that I'd heard good things.  Unfortunately, the weather wasn't cooperative and it threatened to rain upon our arrival.  Because we didn't know how long our bike ride would take, we didn't make reservations.  No covered seating was readily available, so we opted for take-out instead, given that my friend lives in Regent Square.  It took about 10 min. to prepare, and we got on our way just as it started to rain.  We ordered the following: chicken kebab (me; $13.95), iskendar kebab (my friend; $13.95), and  baklava (share; $5).  My entree consisted of grilled chicken cubes with a side of tahini sauce over rice with some vegetables and a piece of pita bread, and my friend's entree was similar except that his meat consisted of ground lamb and beef cubes.  We both thought the portion size was quite large and that the meat was well-seasoned.  I wasn't a huge fan of the pickled peppers, but that's probably personal preference, as I'm not generally a huge fan of peppers.  The baklava was quite syrupy and saccharine--I think it could have been better balanced in texture and flavor.  Overall, we were pleased with our meal from Istanbul Sofra.  The prices were higher than I usually pay for takeout, but the portions were large (e.g., the baklava consisted of 4 pieces), and the quality was good.  I'd definitely recommend reserving a table for weekend dinners to ensure that you can enjoy the pleasant dining atmosphere, which we experienced vicariously as we awaited our food.  The service was friendly, too, which is always nice.  My friend noted that he was much more favorably impressed than he'd been on his first visit, which was shortly after the restaurant's grand opening.  If you're in the neighborhood and are looking to try Turkish cuisine or just something different, I'd recommend giving it a try!",

Their chicken dishes are delicious! Grilled to perfection, I definitely enjoyed the chicken. The baba ghanoush was  equally awesome. Served with toasted pita that was warm and yet still somewhat soft. That gave me the impression that the pita was fresh and not simply pulled out of a bag from the typical wholesale retailer.  The prices were pretty reasonable - expect to drop twenty dollars a person.",

However, what makes this restaurant stand out as one of the best establishments in Pittsburgh is the service, the atmosphere, and the people.  I've been here multiple times with my family. I remember that each time, the owner will come out and ask us how the food is. He always greets everyone with a smile and is obviously very passionate about his job and the restaurant.  My wife and I decided to come here for our rehearsal dinner and we were beyond happy with our experience. With about 40 people that night, the scene was loud, people were walking around, and it was complete chaos. However, we all somehow managed to get our food all about the same time, our water was always refilled, there was always an open bottle of wine on each table. So you can imagine how surprised we were when we realized... there was only one server the whole night. How he managed to do all of that, I will never know. Hands down, the best service I've ever had.  The amazing staff and owner is what makes great food into a restaurant that provides a memorable and personable dining experience.  At the end of the night, the owner came out and greeted us. He said thank you for coming and letting him be a part of this moment in our lives. Finally, He said that he was happy to be a part of our family now too.  If that doesn't make you say \"aww...\" your heart is cold.",

The portions for any of their dinner dishes are huge. It comes with your entree, flavorful rice and a little salad.  You can also get pita bread upon request.  My personal favorite is the adana kabob which is seasoned thinly sliced lamb. I like to put it on the pita bread with some of the salad.  My dad really likes the chicken Adana I think it's called.  It's seasoned, grilled chicken cubes and they are delicious. Would recommend this place to anyone and if you want to save some money go for lunch, it's cheaper and you get a drink with your meal!",

Even though the menu is pretty meat-heavy, there are plenty of vegetarian options, and I always come out feeling like I didn't totally throw my diet away. That being said, they have THE BEST baklava in the city--buttery and sweet, and tastes great washed down with thimble-sized glasses of strong tea or Turkish coffee. The restaurant itself is beautifully decorated, with silver furnishings and colorful carpets and paint. I will definitely come back every time I'm back in my hometown!",

Unfortunately, the dish I got, the Adana Kebab was dry and not very well seasoned (16.50$). The dish my partner got, the Manti (turkish dumplings) was really small bits of pasta in a bland tomato sauce and was lukewarm ($14.50). For the price I was expecting amazing, but the portion on the Adana Kebab was not very big and over all the food wasn't well seasoned. Overall, would not recommend due to the price/size of the food (especially when there are much better middle eastern/turkish restaurants in squirrel hill that are much cheaper!)",

We also ordered Baba Ghanoush which actually was unique and tasty. But the pita served with it was of poor quality. Prices are a bit high (especially for entrees, which deterred me from ordering one), perhaps justifiable by the care taken in decorating. The staff and owner were very friendly and welcoming.",

Waitress brought water but didn't ask me if I wanted anything else to drink.  I ordered the Iskender kebab and the meat was very dry and way over done.  Sauce was bland.  Maybe this wasn't the best choice but I was expecting something with more flavor.  Usually gyro type meat is very flavorful.  So maybe I should have ordered something else but the dry meat had nothing to do with flavor.  I will say the pita bread was some of the best I've ever had.  I may try this restaurant again to taste something else for a fair assessment but based on the first experience I have to say that McDonalds which I refuse to eat at would have been a better choice.",

We opened with 2 appetizers. Now, I love grape leaves and have them every chance I get. Sofra's Grape Leaves were some of the best I have ever had. The texture was perfect and they melted in your mouth, while the seasonings were perfectly balanced. We also had the Cigarette Borek, a wonderful appetizer of feta cheese on a fillo dough. Delicious!  For the main course, I had their lamb mixed grill containing shish kebab, Adana, Kafte and Gyro meat. All were perfectly seasoned and served with a delicious yogurt dressing, My wife had a full plate of the lamb kafte and loved every bite.  Delectable desserts were still in our future. We had the Kazandibi, a sweet milk pudding with cinammon, and the Revani, a dense spongecake with a dollop of whipped cream. It was a perfect topper to a wonderful meal.  We will definately be back!",

Went there last night with a fellow TI Coach who lives in the neighborhood and frequents the restaurant weekly.  The design and decorations take you back immediately to Turkey if you have ever traveled there.  When you first enter the vestibule you will see the shoe shine stand that you will see still used in Turkey today.  The pictures of Istanbul are excellent, brought back lots of great memories.  It was raining heavily last night so we could not enjoy a table outside on the patio.  Katherine was our server and just bubbled over with enthusiasm and described all the dishes superbly.  We started with pita and homemade fresh yogurt.  The pita was reminiscent of our time in Incirlik, Turkey from 1991-1993.  We have been on the prowl for one of our favorite dishes, chicken tava (basically a stew cooked in a pottery bowl) and have yet to find one that reminded us of our time in Turkey.  Well last night we found it.  They served it as a vegetarian, lamb, or chicken dish.  It did not disappoint and immediately transported my mind back to our days at the BP Restaurant in Incirlik.  They also have the exact same spice used which is gourd red pepper and a couple of other spices not exactly known that gives the dish a spicy but sweet flavor.  My wife had Turkish Tea to drink which came in the traditional Turkish Tea Glass.  For desert we had Baklava and I had Turkish Coffee.  The best I have had since we left Turkey.  The owner came out and we talked and found out that he came from a town about 20 min from Adana which is about 10 min from Incirlik.  He was the general manager of the Hilton at Mersin when we were in Turkey.  A very friendly and gracious host.  If you're looking for True Turkish experience from food to hospitality then this is your place.",

I came with a group of four friends and we ordered various appetizer sampler platters as well as shrimp kabobs, lentil soup, and falafel. The food took a bit longer than expected to arrive (we went a few weeks after they'd opened and it seemed like everyone wanted to try Istanbul Sofra the night we were there) so we were given complimentary Turkish tea during the wait. Everything was delicious and exceeded our expectations in terms of quality and taste. I'm glad Regent Square has such a wonderful little restaurant, and I look forward to dining here again in the future.",

With that said this place has really friendly service & owner but the food is just OK. It would be nice if they actually had Basmati rice or even real Shish Kabob which in good places has chunks of Filet Minon rather than lamb cubes.  Some of the dishes were not the norm & I'm not sure I would rank this the #1 restaurant in Pittsburgh personally like what I've seen in Trip Advisor.",

    "text": "I adore this place and recommend it to anyone who will listen to me (and some who won't).   This location has been a challenge for other businesses because of the busy intersection right outside which is in contrast to a beautiful park across the street. The owners seem to make changes every time I go that make the outside seating area better and better. They now have a banner with the restaurant's name fencing us in as well as tall plants and umbrellas to mark the boundaries, and even though you get the occasional loud car interrupting the meal it is SO much better every time.   The outdoor seating is where it's at -- I will miss this when winter comes! They have two canopies with lanterns hanging under them as well as several large umbrellas to keep the hot sun off of you. The tables are small but make for an intimate dinner with your companions. The last time I visited, they had a belly dancer performing -- she danced between the tables, balancing a sword on her head, and was quite a fun addition to our mealtime.  Now - the food! Everything I have had has been delicious, and the portions are quite ample. I have never had enough room for dessert, but maybe if I could not order the incredibly tasty falafel appetizer I would have room. I have had the falafel, the chicken kofte, and the lamb adana. All of them were delicately spiced with just enough spice to lend an incredible flavor to the meat without overpowering the meat itself. These were served on a bed of rice which was a perfect complement to the meat. There are also a mixture of vegetables on the plate, some crunchy and some roasted, to give you something a little bit different.   I always finish the meal with their tea, which is served hot in a glass. It makes for a nice ending to a meal.   I hope Istanbul Sofra is around for a long time, because they are a wonderful addition to the Regent Square community.",

I recommend this as the place to take your friends and family when they're wondering where to go to Pittsburgh. Sit outside or inside, they've got great seating options. I recommend bringing your own wine, baba ganoush appetizer, a platter to share (they're big enough for two) and either the baklava or rice pudding for dessert. For two people, that's about $40-45 with a 20% tip. Worth every penny.",

The appetizer platter accompanied by a basket of warm pita is enough to satisfy two people. So delicious, my favorite being the baba ganoush. Ahhh getting hungry thinking about it...  We also ordered spinach eggrolls, very plain and a bit dry, but went well with the yogurt dip. It felt like it was missing something.  We took the lamb/beef patties to go... to be eaten several hours afterwards due to full stomachs. They were well combined and tasted fantastic by itself... but also good with the buttery rice and pickled salad. It should have came with a drink too, but we were never asked about it unfortunately.  baba ganoushhhhhhhh *salvate*",

We started with a few heaping plates each of hummus, baba ghanoush and tabuli. My friend Kamal, coming from a Muslim/Syrian background and myself from a Jewish/Ashkenazi background (with some Israeli connection) felt comfortable judging these appetizers as fully authentic, and just as savoury. The Pita bread flowed like water and we were fully satisfied.  For my main course, I went with the chicken kabob. The spice mixture was wonderful. I would have preferred a thicker yogurt sauce, but still satisfying nonetheless. The mixed salad was a nice pallet cleanser between bites of chicken and pickled veggies. Overall, this food platter was a complete spread, that offered a diverse group of tastes that resulted in the platter never becoming boring to the tongue. Although I was so full by the meal's conclusion, I wish I could have kept eating.  Istanbul Sofra is the real deal, providing fully authentic mediterranean and middle eastern cuisine. You should be happy ordering anything here. I would so return to get more.",

    "text": "Great food and service. Dined here for their Valentine's Day special. The restaurant was nicely decorated, although it seemed like we were not seated at the original table that had been booked (we purposely had booked a table near to another couple of friends, but ended up two rooms away) and the staff appeared to be overwhelmed with the volume of patrons. Once seated, our waitress was very friendly and explained to us the Valentine's Day dinner special for $65. We had already booked based off of the Valentine's event online, so our decision to go ahead with the dinner special was easy. Each course was delicious! We began with the stuffed artichokes and kibbah appetizers, which were perfect starters to the meal - one cold and one hot appetizer. Our entrees were a shrimp saute and chicken kebab in a clay pot with vegetables and rice. Very balanced and tasty! Finally, the tres leches cake dessert was beautiful and adorable! Heart shaped cake with a layer of jam, topped with a chocolate covered strawberry. It was a perfect end for the meal and was complimented very well by the Turkish coffee and tea we got.  Our only complaint about the meal was that we did not receive the champagne that had been advertised as part of the fixed price meal. It appeared no one in the back room who had the Valentine's dinner received champagne either, however when we were leaving, we passed the couple we originally planned to sit near, and saw they had received champagne. Not a huge deal, however it was slightly disappointing given that it had been promised as included in the price we paid.   Overall, very good restaurant with great food and a very nice staff. However, the staff seemed overwhelmed/confused at times, perhaps due to the business of the event night.",

Would have been a great place to sit in the spring, summer or fall but with the colder temps it was too cold so we asked to move. They were super awesome about it.  Where we ended up sitting was warmer but not warm enough. We ended up putting on our coats and we weren't alone.  To be clear and fair temps outside were single digit.   The service was super friendly and responsive. My partner got the lamb izkander and it was great. Very flavorful. I got the chicken Adana. Again tasty. While good we were not blown away.  We both got the apple tea. It was so delicious. Definitely something different!  We ended the meal with dessert. It was a cheese pasty thing with a name that I don't remember.  At my age it is not often that I can say I've never had anything like this...but last night I did. I liked it. It was so unsual. Basically it shredded philo and honey crust with a cheese (not a cream cheese but like cows milk cheese) in the center.  Truly gotta try it. I liked it.  The jury is still out for my companion on this dessert.  I'm recommending this place. It's worth coming too when it's not freezing cold out. I think you will e satisfied like we were. We just weren't wowed enough in any aspect or combination of aspects to warrant trip back.",

The servers were polite, answered our questions we had and what not, but they weren't as friendly as I'd hoped.   Additionally, this place was so expensive for what it was!  Kebab plates just seemed to expensive, it seemed like you just got a big helping of rice.  The appetizers were okay, but everything sort of tasted the same.  The Turkish coffee was good, but it's like $4 for less than a shot of coffee.  An okay experience, but I don't feel like I got my money's worth.   Since we were in a group, 18% gratuity was included, and they said they could only split our checks 9 ways, which I thought was very odd but worth passing on to others.",

We started with a mix of hot appetizers which provided an opportunity to sample various Turkish starters. For those who like eggplant, the Imam Bayildi was very good. Iskender Kebab is thinly cut grilled lamb in pita bread, with yogurt and was a personal favorite. Adama kebab features ground lamb and I would probably not order that again; I think it was well-prepared, but needed the compliment of tomatoes or yogurt to make it moister. For desert you can't go wrong with the baklava but we also tried kazandibi which is a caramelized milk pudding and which was excellent. Service was excellent and friendly in this informal neighborhood restaurant. BYOB wine.",

There was a wait for tables and I felt like there wasn't really a system yet for taking down names and making sure everyone got a table, but the time they quoted us was pretty accurate.  What we sampled: Hot mixed appetizers: It was good and a nice amount for four to share. I was most impressed by the borek filled with feta cheese which was delicious!  Humus: Outstanding.  The pita bread was not all heated through, but the humus was so delicious! I had the shish kebab. It was delicious! I was really happy with the flavor and paired with the rice, salad, cabbage, and yogurt sauce it made for delicious wraps with the pita. Others at the table sampled the kofte (so good!), gyro (delicious!), and the iskender kebab (I loved this! The yogurt it was served with was incredible!) We also ordered Turkish Coffee and Tea as well as the baklava to end the meal.  I wasn't a fan of either the coffee or tea, but the baklava was some of the best I have ever had!  There where a few service snafus, but the waitress was very apologetic and kept thanking us for our patience. Overall the food took a while to come out, but once we where eating we where happy!",

Great location at the corner of Forbes and South Braddock in Regent Square.   The owner came over after our meal to check whether we were pleased. He told us about his excitement about having his own place, and the long experience he has had in restaurant work.  We ordered both the cold and hot appetizer plates and an order of dolmas. All outstanding! I didn't think there could be good new flavors in hummus and baba ganouj, but I was wrong. One order of each platter was enough for us to share. Every item was absolutely delicious. We were so full that we didn't have room for the kebabs, which is what we originally went for. We wanted to save room for dessert, which was heavenly rice pudding. The Turkish coffee was of course aromatic and rich.  Yelp ambience categories don't really fit. Could be casual or somewhat dressy & romantic depending on your wishes. The ethnic Turkish decor is simple and pleasing.  Some outdoor seating. We found free parking on the street. Might be good to combine a meal and a film at the nearby Regent Sq. theater. Can't wait to eat at Istanbul Sofra again!",

The fried zucchini patties were a group favorite among the many appetizers sampled. The mixed eggplant in tomato sauce was so delicious with the Turkish pide bread. The grilled kofte was also a big hit as was the grilled fresh fish of the day. The favorite dessert was the scrumptious Revani. The portions were generous, it's BYOB & the service was attentive & friendly!  Can't wait to go again.",

    "text": "Sercan, pronounced Serjan, for those of you like me that don't speak Turkish, was a fantastic server. He was humble and kind and welcoming and eager that his customers have a good experience.  And that delightful commitment to service could not have been paired better than to be combined with this restaurant's food. The lamb... was delicious. The rice... was delicious. The hummus... was delicious. The restaurant was just beautiful.  If you check-in on Yelp you get a free glass of wine. Which is a rather unique offering in a restaurant that doesn't otherwise serve it.   And just to keep you on your toes they offer a crazy drink that I'd never heard of called salgam. It feels sometimes like the planet is being overrun by Coke and Pepsi products so when I find a restaurant that's offering a drink I'm unfamiliar with I'll order it blind. No explanation necessary we're just  gonna roll with it. And this one was a doozy. It looks like red wine but it tastes salty. It's a flavor I recognize but can't immediately place. It's...like....pickle juice. I'm sure, somehow that I've got that wrong until I Google it and confirm that this remarkable drink is exactly that, pickle juice made from red carrots. Unreal. Probably not the kind of thing that's going to be my next go-to beverage but a wonderfully unique peak into a culture's culinary heritage.   Istanbul Sofra you hit all of my hot buttons. Amazing service, delightful food, a beautiful environment and a little surprise thrown in. I thoroughly enjoyed my time here and you've inspired me to search out some of the Turkish places a little closer to home.",

    "text": "Istanbul Sofra serves solid Mediterranean fare, and the portions are quite size-able, so that makes the prices reasonable.   I sat outside and despite the road noise, it was a really pleasant atmosphere. As many reviews have already stated, if you check-in on Yelp you receive a free glass of wine. The restaurant is BYOB (and looking at other reviews, I suspect this was not the format originally), so the free glass of wine was a sediment-y red that came from the fridge and was probably bought when they used to serve alcohol. However, you'll never hear me complain about anyone giving me a drink for free.  The food arrived quickly, and the service was excellent. I ordered the hummus as an appetizer, and it was delicious. The best thing about this hummus was the texture. It was a little looser than hummus that you might by in a tub from the grocery store, and that thinner texture created an incredibly creamy dip. The pita served with it was warm and had that delectable smokey char that only the best pita sports. I would've loved some carrots or bell peppers to dip into it as well!  For my meal, I ordered the Doner Kebab and boy was there a lot of it! The thinly sliced meat was served on a platter with buttery rice and a tomato and cucumber salad with an herbal bite. The yogurt sauce was the perfect pairing. I felt like the meat itself was a little under seasoned, but the rich, butter flavor from the rice and bright notes from the salad paired with the touch of richness from the yogurt sauce made a really balanced bite when all together on a fork. I found myself dreaming about adding a little hot sauce into the mix, but I figured that was Mediterranean sacrilege--so I restrained myself.   Overall, Istanbul Sofra provides a hefty amount of good Mediterranean food for a reasonable price. I recommend bringing your own bottle of wine for your meal, ordering the hummus, and smuggling in your own mini bottle of Cholula in your purse, Beyonce-style.",

I get really creeped out when that happens because I know it was just haphazardly heated up (probably microwaved) and it makes me nervous about the quality. The cold apps seemed fresh enough but my falafel was mushy and not warm.   I'm disappointed because I went to a fun event here about a year ago and the food was good!

It had Grilled eggplant which was coarsely blended with parsley and olive oil in it. We completed our pita bread within minutes with the delicious baba ganoush. We also ordered falafel which is made fresh to  our order. It tasted good but it is not the best falafel I ever had.   For main course, we ordered Chicken kebab which is served with well marinated chicken cubes that are char broiled and have slight lemon flavor to it. It is well cooked, served over a bed of rice, with grilled tomato, proper and salad. The chicken tasted so good that I forgot to eat it with the yogurt dip they give. I highly recommend this dish.   We ended the dinner with some refreshing turkish coffee and kunefe. Kunefe is some kind of cheese (probably goat cheese) wrapped between fried vermicelli and dipped in a sweet syrup. It is very delicious and I suggest all dessert lovers out there to try this dish.",

My aunt and uncle brought a bottle of wine and my husband and I brought some beer.  We ordered hummus and calamari for an appetizer. The hummus tasted fresh af and the pita bread was deliciously warm. The calami came in the form of rings with a side of sauce and a lemon wedge. Some of the best calami I've had.  I ordered the chicken doner. The chicken was super tender and flavorful. The rice was cooked perfect and I loved the yogurt sauce on the side. I would definitely order this again.   My husband ordered another chicken dish but I'm not sure what it was called. It was good and I tasted too.   I'm not in Pittsburgh often but I will be sure to come here each time I come to town.

The owner was very friendly and polite.   I highly recommend making a reservation though and the seating process is my only complaint. We didn't have a reservation and although our party of two was seated in around 20 minutes, there was no organization or list of names for people who didn't have any reservation. This caused parties of the same size being seated before us and made the seating process a little stressful. I will absolutely make a reservation next time but am looking forward to coming back.",

The calamari was really good. It was crunchy and the sauce was so yummy! The mixed platter is a good selection since it gives you a little bit of everything.  I enjoyed most of it but sometimes didn't know what I was eating. As for the atmosphere, it wasn't too crowded but we were given the option to sit outside if we wanted to. I decided to stay inside since it was too hot outside. Usually, I'm always cold but during our visit, I was extremely hot that I started feeling lightheaded. My friend was also struggling to enjoy the meal because how hot it was inside. Sadly, I really wanted dessert but we had to cut our dinner short since the heat was uncomfortable.",

Our service was excellent and, while the atmosphere of the restaurant wasn't anything amazing, we were comfortable.  We sampled the hummus and pita as an appetizer - very tasty! The menu offers a lot of options and though I can't entirely speak for their authenticity, it seemed like a lot of the menu items were traditional rather than some kind of fusion-y version. I had the iskender kebab - the combination of the acidic tomato sauce and mild yogurt was excellent on this dish. We actually saved room for dessert as well - the revani was delightful and my wife really enjoyed the kunefe which is a less sweet/more savory dessert. I can't say anything negative about the quality or taste of the food.  The only negative I can think of is the parking situation. I don't mind street parking, but there is a church lot directly across from the restaurant which seems to go unused during evenings. It's a shame the church and restaurant can't make an agreement considering how busy Istanbul Sofra can get. Parking is worth the minor hassle for this delicious food though! We will definitely be back!",

All around the outside are various posters with the BOYB  marked on it. The entrance is on S. Braddock Ave which sits directly opposite Frick Park. To find parking you will need to check side streets off of Forbes as you head eastward.  The place is beautifully decorated inside and very small. With your Yelp check you will get a free glass of wine. I was pleasantly surprised at how good it tasted. i was given the regular menu but inside there was a sheet with a lunch menu. I knew this place was expensive but the lunch menu made everything much more reasonable. Most of the chicken used in their dishes are both dark and white meat so I opted for lamb. They had a lamb gyro for $6.50 with toppings and sauce or a lamb wrap for $7.50 with the same items in it. All lunch items come with your choice of Turkish tea, soft drinks, or Turkish ice tea which is actually your standard ice tea you would get anywhere.  My order came pretty fast and the gyro was very good. The food is authentic Turkish and was very pleased with my choice. I declined dessert since the gyro alone was quite filling for me. I was glad to learn that it is much cheaper to come for lunch. Lunch entrees from the dinner menu are available as well. Looking forward to coming here again soon.",

I was able to sample their hummus and shish kabob (so flavorful and tender!), try baba ganoush for the first time, and enjoy a bulgur kafte that was hand formed by the owner's own mother.    I have never been to the Middle East, but this restaurant took me there the moment I walked in the door!  The restaurant is huge but laid out nicely so that no area is too crowded or loud, and each room has been decorated beautifully in Turkish decor.    Istanbul Sofra is BYOB and their front patio space looks perfect for a nice summer dinner!",

I've never eaten Turkish food so this was completely a first for me. I was a bit nervous, only because I did not know what to expect. Well, this place has truly won my taste buds heart! Ok, taste buds don't have a heart, but you get my drift. The food was extremely flavorful - and seasoned perfectly! My faves that I had was the Plyaz, made of red beans with peppers and onions. It sort of gave me a Mexican flavor. I also enjoyed the falafel and grilled salmon.  Everything was delicious! Just a quick tip, stop in soon and check in to get a complimentary glass of wine!",

We went on an unusually warm Saturday night in February so everyone was out and in a great mood.  Luckily, I made online reservations so they had our table ready when we got there- it was crazy how they led you through all these rooms filled with people all having a great time. I didn't realize the place was that big!    It's byob so don't forget to bring your booze :-)  Started off with a couple of appetizers - definitely get the baba ganoush- they serve it with this incredibly delicious warm pita bread - honestly there was not a drop left of it after we got done.  We also had the  Cigarette Borek (filo filled with warmed feta) super rich and delicious.    We ended up splitting the sofra grilled platter - definitely enough food for 2 people and we took a lot home and had enough for a big lunch for both of us!  This was a way to sample a bit of everything - includes Shish kebab, Adana Kebab, Lamb Kofte kebab, Lamb Chops, Chicken Kebab, Chicken Kofte Doner (gyro) Served with home made rice, garnish salad and grilled tomato and peppers.  I feel like the star of the platter was the chicken kebob - it was super juicy and flavorful.   We were too full for dessert but thank god we took home some baklava - they give you 4 luscious little squares that were to die for.   Will definitely be back - I heard the hummus was a must try as well.  I think they also have belly dancers but they weren't there the night we went.",

An interesting hot appetizer is \"Cigarette Borek\", phyllo rolls stuffed with warm feta cheese. There are always daily specials to try. The Izgara Kofte was excellent on one visit. On another I selected Adana Kebab and found it tasty as well. Mains are served over rice. Try a slice of Revani (semolina cake with orange syrup and walnuts) for dessert. Don't forget to order a Turkish Tea. Istanbul Sofra is on our list when visiting Pittsburgh.  Istanbul Sofra can fill up quickly. I recommend making a reservation. Alcoholic beverages are not served, but patrons may bring a bottle of wine (corkage fee).",

    "text": "I came here upon looking up top restaurants in pgh. First I will say the location is great as it is in a relatively quiet area right across from Frick Park. Outdoor seating is also pretty nice although today it was too hot to be outside.  Nonetheless, upon entering I requested outdoor seating and was then seated outside. The hostess didn't really smile or seem too friendly but she did grant me an outdoor seat. Initially I had to wait a bit for water and then kept waiting for someone to wait on me. One of the waiters then came out to stack plates on the other tables. Feeling hot, I requested to sit inside just before he obliged and led me to an indoor seat. Shortly after I was greeted by whom I think might have been a manager but not sure. He was far more accommodating and immediately took my order, which was the Haydari appetizer and for my entree the Lamb mixed grill.  The appetizer was pretty decent but the mixed grill really didn't stand out or wow me in anyway. The rice, while not terrible was not super great. I will say the marinade used for the lamb was pretty decent. I got filled up real quick and ended up packing most of it. Being that I always leave room for dessert, I ordered the Revani, which I felt was a very large portion but was too sweet.  The person who served me, who again seemed like he was a manager, was a genuinely nice guy and went out of his way to serve me including packing up all of my food all the while being friendly and engaging in small talk. Unfortunately, the meal just didn't do it for me especially for a price of $35 although the portions were large. Even after having left overs I just feel really bloated and not really blown away by the food. If I had to offer advice I would say the rice could be dryer and fluffier, and the dessert much less sweet. I feel doing that would make a significant difference. Actual rating for me is 3.5 stars because of the manager's demeanor and diligent service.",

Same goes for the music playing on the speakers.  Our waitress was terrifically attentive, polite, and professional, and prices were reasonable.  Now, the food...let me just say up front that I disagree - vehemently - with other reviews maligning the food quality here!  The falafel was nice and crisp on the outside, hot and fresh on the inside (could've used a little salt, but better under- than over-salted, imho).  I had the doner kebap out of sheer study-abroad nostalgia, and it was exactly what I'd been hoping for!  The mouth-watering slices of lamb were seasoned and cooked to perfection and arranged prettily on a plate over tasty rice, with the appropriate accompaniments.  The basket of pita bread that came out was soft, warm, and very good-tasting.  My favorite European street food, all grown up. *sniffle*  As for the rest, the husband's eyes are bigger than his stomach, so he ordered the lamb shish kebab for himself AND a plate of \"manti,\" tiny little vegetable dumplings in tomato sauce and yogurt, for us to split.  The lamb shish kebab was delicious and served similarly to my doner kebap, and the manti was a successful experiment in stepping out of our comfort zone!  Bottom line...if you're hoping for a little culinary adventure in pleasant surroundings, with conscientious wait staff and high-quality food, I strongly recommend Istanbul Sofra.",

These are the things that save it from being a one star experience. It almost breaks my heart to write this review. I seriously hoped that they would raise the local standard for middle eastern food.  I don't understand all the great reviews because the food is awful. It's equally as bad as any of the other restaurants in the area. I don't understand why falafel in Pittsburgh has to be soggy or why this restaurant needs to persist with this tradition. The hummus and babaganoush were okay (they should be excellent at a place like this), but the tabouli was almost inedible. The rice was not spiced or fluffy. The lamb was boring and the dumpling plate is ALL teeny tiny undercooked dumplings a bland sauce and no sides. When I asked for hot sauce I got Frank's rather than harissa.  The only decent dish was the lentil soup which was buttery and comforting, if a little lacking in lentil flavor. I guess the pitas were fluffy and okay, even if they were just reheated grocery store ones.  I would go back just to sit in the warm coziness, but I guess my only ordering option would be lentil soup.",

I live a few blocks away, the owner is almost always in there politely answering questions (and sometimes passing out Turkish delight :) - staff is friendly and competent.  Interior is well done, though it can be a bit tight moving around during peak dinner hours. I know there is a back room for small parties but haven't sat back there yet.  They also serve lunch for around $10 (including a drink), outside seating can be a bit loud with traffic noise during rush hour because they're on a busy corner. If you're going before 7pm you should try to park in the neighborhood behind the restaurant if you can, on-street parking out front is limited at certain times.   I feel very lucky to live within walking distance of authentic Turkish food that tastes this good - it's quickly become where we go for a special dinner out.",

The staff is so great, honestly the best service I have ever had at a restaurant. I am definitely telling all my friends about this place and going back soon :)",

    "text": "We were looking for somewhere new and came to Yelp for help. Visited here based on other reviews and, I must say, food, service and atmosphere were excellent. There's currently a storm rolling through town (remnants of Hurricane Bill) so their outside seating was partially closed. The inside was alive and full of energy.   We placed our reservations via their website, when we walked in and our reservation was right there. They are on their game. Our waitress, Cathy, was very friendly, professional and attentive.   Appetizer of small sampler platter and grape leaves were incredible. For our main meal, I had the chicken sampler over rice with grilled pepper, while my wife had the Turkish lamb chops over rice, both were wonderful; there were no leftovers. For dessert, we split their rice pudding (and I'm a sucker for rice pudding).   Near the end, the owner stopped by to see how we enjoyed dinner. He asked if we tried the baklava, and when he heard we hadn't, he went back to the kitchen and brought out two small pieces, perfect for sampling. Needless to say, it, too, was amazing.   If I had one complaint it would be the fact that parking is at a premium in that location. We found a spot around the corner on a residential street.  Just take care not to block a driveway or park in front of a hydrant. Not that big of an issue, I was able to walk off the baklava after dinner.   Thank you for a great experience and an even better dinner. We'll definitely be back... I already miss the sampler platter.",

    "text": "This is my first review of Istanbul Sofra, based on a 4 person visit there last night -- 6 - 8 PM.  Reservations were made easily, and honored when we arrived.  Our group came in spread out over about a half hour.  The server attended to the table frequently, which was off in a side room and not the main area, frequently.  This is the area with a small bar, and close to the central \"computer\" system for managing orders.  I think it was the owner/manager who greeted us and took us to our table.  Other Yelp reviewers note that the corner location has challenged other enterprises.  The restaurant will need to \"manage\" the space outside to make it even more presentable.  The \"corner\" with its associated clutter will need to be separated by a visible line or barrier so everyone knows what Sofra's area is, and what the other small business area is.  \"Ropes\" might work, or a line of tables or even taller potted plants - rather than the \"entry\" being the door, it will need to pushed outside a bit, as in New York restaurants.  As trivial fix actually but important as an element in \"entryway presentation\"  or whatever it is that architects say.  Sofra's have been open only 2 months.  Most places take 3-5 months to \"settle down\" - service, quality, presentation -  Sofra's is there already.  I presume it was the manager/owner who greeted us, and seated us, and came around frequently.  I did speak to him on the way out and asked \"how it was going.\"  He engaged fully, was pleased I would be asking, and wanted us to return.  I do like places where the \"management\" has an actual stake in the customer experience, and their own fiscal futures.    BYOB - one brings their own wine to the venue, and there is a trivial corkage fee.  The ice bucket is provided for the wine.  Nicely done in all respects.  Grape leaves - ordered and 5 appeared.  Grape leaves as an item vary significantly in the Middle Eastern cuisine.  Everyone has their own \"signature\" grape leaves.  These were excellent and well presented on the plate.  Three of us ordered the Shish Kebab - \"Char-broiled lamb cubes, cooked on skewers and delicately marinated in Turkish spices. Served with rice, our special yogurt sauce and grilled vegetables.\"  The lamb cubes were perfect and taken off the skewers.  Rice tasty and spiced nicely.  Lentil soup ordered by 2 of the 4 -- they've had it before and said it was, again, excellent.    Portions we so amble we could not entertain the notion of desserts.  Thus, a \"dessert\" and coffee run seems to be in order...  As we were receiving our checks, there was the need to separate a bill into two components.  One couple was going \"dutch.\"  The server simply managed this without a grumble or \"look\" of any kind.  This was not an error on their part - it was a lack of clarity on our part.  What is so often an OMG moment was handled with aplomb.  Perfect.    There is more to be said but other recent reviewers have said it better than I could.   //Oh, and here is the quick edit -- TV's and TV screens -- NONE.  I am so tired of going to 'restaurants' that have a dozen huge TV's playing a variety of channels... it was a relief to experience \"dining\" versus everyone trying to outdo themselves with large screen TV's. //  If you live on the north side of Pittsburgh, use a GPS to get there.  It is easy but does take a bit of navigation - go early to avoid rush hour traffic.  Free parking is  around the corner and on side streets.    We will be going back there.  It is wonderful to find a place that doesn't have 7 different varieties of hamburgers, fries, and nachos as the ultimate in dining delight.  Meh... as it might be said to that level of originality...  Istanbul Sofra's is a must visit dining experience.    Welcome to Pittsburgh.  F8 and be there.",

    "text": "I tried this place with my parents and boyfriend on a Friday night. The place was absolutely bustling. We were lucky to get seats even though we were walk-ins--in general you should probably make a reservation.  Our first impression was that the ambiance was delightful. The entire restaurant--down to the patterned tablecloths, light fixtures, and the art on the wall--is designed to display elements of Turkish culture.  We tried many dishes and loved them all. For appetizers, we shared the falafel and the eggplant/tomato spread. For our main courses, we got the shish kebab, adana kebab, and the special at the time: sultan's delight (a tomato-based lamb stew on top of a bed of creamy eggplant puree). For dessert, we got the baklava, kazandibi (milk pudding with a caramelized exterior), kunefe (a sweet dessert cheese with a shredded wheat crust), and some Turkish coffee and tea to go with it. The coffee and tea had a wonderful presentation because they come out on these special trays with special cups. All the food we tried was delicious, but I'd definitely say the lamb stew/eggplant special stood out the most--I hope they consider adding it to their permanent menu!   To top it all off, our service was incredibly helpful and attentive. You get warmly greeted at the door. Our server even patiently helped my father navigate the menu despite his many dietary restrictions.  Definitely try this place out if you're in town!",

Then, when I checked in on Yelp, I was surprised to see that an offer popped up for a free glass of wine.  When I asked the waitress about it, she asked the owner, who came over and made sure we each got a small glass of red wine!  Pleasant surprise.  The restaurant is in a small, intimate space. Tables are close together, and the wait staff is very friendly and seems like part of a family.  The owner came up to our table and greeted us and chatted with us.  The relaxed atmosphere made it feel as if we were at a large family event, like a wedding reception.  The food was great. We had a selection of cold and warm appetizers, and a shish kabob entree.  Having been to Istanbul, I was hoping for a vibe that might take me back... and I must say, it did not disappoint!  For a special occasion or just a dinner out on any night of the week, I definitely recommend Istanbul Sofra.",

I had dolmas to start, salmon for my main, a free glass of very sweet red wine, and Turkish tea. All delicious, especially the lemony salmon. Even their included pita is lovely and warm!  For desert, I was excited to try the special: a Turkish milk pudding with chicken breast. Yes, you read correctly. It was not my favorite, mostly texturally. But I like to take risks and try everything once! I was chatting with the owner and he noticed I had only taken a few bites and asked me about it. Just conversationally I said it wasn't my favorite but I was interested in its history. He then immediately ordered me a serving of baklava on the house. I. Love. Baklava. I basically told him I didn't like his desert and he gave me my favorite. I love him.   I'd probably come back just for my favorite restaurateur even if the food was mediocre, honestly. That level of service is hard to find. Luckily for me I love the food, too!",

    "text": "I had been trying to plan dinner with friends for weeks (if not months), and we decided to finally make something happen on a date that conveniently coincided with Pittsburgh Restaurant Week. We both live east of the city, and our friends suggested that we check out Istanbul Sofra's $26.16 multi-course dinner menu.  The best way to describe the appearance of the restaurant is... eccentric. I feel like someone collected a bunch of super cliche \"Turkish\" decorations and made absolutely zero interior decorating edits when putting the restaurant together. My initial reaction when seeing the restaurant was oh-my-what-have-I-gotten-myself-into. Thankfully, the decor in no way reflected my experience of the food and service of the restaurant.  The service was very prompt and attentive. English is likely a second language to our waitress, but she did her best to describe the menu options and answer our questions. The restaurant manager or owner - not sure who he was - also checked on us toward the end of the meal, which is a service that I always appreciate.  The food was really delicious. The four of us ordered four different cold appetizers (included in our Restaurant Week prix fixe dinner) Hummus, Dolma (Stuffed Grape Leaves), Haydari, and Baba Ghanoush. All four were very tasty and quickly attacked by the four of us. My personal favorite was the Haydari (yogurt with chopped walnuts, garlic, and dried mint), and I just couldn't stop hoarding pita to eat with this dish. For my entree, I ordered the Lamb & Chicken Shish Kebab. The dish was huge, and I only made it through eating my kebabs, leaving some of my rice and a good portion of my salad and side of vegetables. Everything was very flavorful and well-seasoned - definitely an entree I would order again. Finally, for dessert, I ordered the simple Baklava, which I had been craving for some reason that week. It was a solid, tasty selection, but the rest of the table was more adventurous. My husband ordered the milk pudding, which I thought was similar to a Spanish Flan, and our friend Jason was the only one who bravely ordered the Restaurant Week special Tavuk Gogsu, a milk pudding made with chicken meat. The pudding in this dish was a bit more savory and every other bite or so had a small piece of boiled chicken inside. It was odd - but not bad.  I recommend looking past the goofy decor and trying this restaurant - I think you'll like it!",

Nicely decorated interior and very friendly staff made this place quite interesting. They helped us with the menu. We ordered their signature beverages, Ayran and Salgam. Both were tasty. For the main dish, we had Sofra Mix Grill. All the kebabs were so good! The meats were very soft and juicy. One plate is good for two. They also served pita breads on the sides. Even the grilled tomato and pepper were perfect too. Its one of the best middle-eastern food we had in the whole country.",

Portion sizes were generous and the prices were fair.  The decor was really nicely done: inviting, warm, and comfortable. It seemed authentic without being overdone.

    "text": "I can't claim to be a Turkish food expert, but I happen to love this place! It helps that our Turkish friends that we frequent Istanbul Sofra with also vouch for the food and have always been there to help explain the menu.  We've been going since just after Instanbul Sofra replaced the less-than-impressive Alma, so we've seen the owner's commitment to improvement in the changes to both the atmosphere and the menu over the last year or so. I've seen my favorite dish (Iskender) refined and my favorite dessert (kanafeh) added to the menu.   You can't beat the service that the staff provides for the most part. The owner is always making sure your table is treated well, and that you're happy with your meal. If there's something that you didn't enjoy, don't hesitate to tell him. I've never been somewhere that's so open to thoughts and willing to accept criticism and show such gratefulness when complimented.  The attentiveness and feeling of appreciation from the staff would keep us coming back even if the food wasn't excellent, but fortunately, we don't have to worry about that! The food is delicious! As mentioned above, the iskender is awesome, as well as the adana kebab. Our friends are fans of the lamb chops, as well, and we've tried all of the desserts and appetizers offered. I love the spinach borek and haydari from the app menu, and the am completely obsessed with both their baklava, kunefeh, and revani!  I'd say the only thing that I don't love is the belly dancers that we've experienced on Fridays. It can catch you off-guard if you're not ready for it. The loud music and dancers make for an awkward interruption they start in the middle of a meal. Otherwise, you can't go wrong at Instanbul Sofra!",

BF got a chicken dish which he liked (he doesn't like lamb too much) but I thought it wasn't as flavorful as my dish.  Compared to other turkish/middle eastern restaurants that I've tried in Pittsburgh, it's a little pricier - but you get a better ambience here. I would def come again.

The zucchini was purred almost and had fresh spices and dill. The falafel was the best we ever had, it wasn't greasy it tasted almost baked and the chickpea and spice combination was divine.

We arrived before our reservation, but still had to wait 15 min over. The wait staff were very friendly, but the spaces seemed too tight for many to walk through at once. We started with the hummus, which was good. I would say pretty standard. I could decide a dish, so I got the lamb mix grill - Shish kebab,  Adana Kebab, Lamb Kofte kebab, Lamb Chop, and doner (gyro). The lamb chop was delicious, tender, flavorful, finger licking good. The kebabs, however, were all too dry and tough. Flavor seemed there, but the meat wasn't tender at all. I couldn't finish my plate.  It's neat they're BYOB, but there were a few rowdy tables.",

Seda, Islam, and the other members of the waitstaff team made my family feel so welcome, even when my preschooler wasn't necessarily the best guest. The food is so good too!! (Though I do wish the price point was slightly lower? Or maybe that they also had some kind of counter-service / deli-style to-go option?)",

I frequently get carryout (at least twice a month, sometimes more) and I noticed that my iskender kebab comes out a little different every time. I would love if they could improve consistency with this. Overall, great restaurant and love BYOB!",

The lunch menu comes with a variety of choices and the price is so reasonable. I got the shish kebob(cubed lamb on a skewer), a yogurt/walnut/mint appetizer, and turkish coffee all for under $20. The lunch was very good and also included a choice of soda, juice, or cay. I am not really familiar with turkish coffee so I decided to try it without sugar. I mentioned to Nilyufar (the wonderful waitress) that I didn't really care for it. She offered to prepare another one with sugar to see if I liked it better than the one without it (there was no additional charge on the bill for the extra one). Nilyufar was  accomodating and helpful with menu items that were not familiar to me. When I am back in the area, I will visit again.",

The manager truly does take pride in the restaurant. Even on a busy Saturday night he is always walking around and talking to every table to make sure that the good and service are exceeding everyone's expectations. On one occasion my husband wanted to order a particular lamb dish and the manager actually told him that he did not want to sell it to him b/c it wouldn't be as good as it should be due to a delivery error from the food vendor. He then recommended another dish that was fantastic. The portions here are also generous and we never have room for dessert. I also love the fact that it's BYOB. If you haven't tried this place, do it now! You won't be disappointed.",

Just one year old, it's clear they are still working out the kinks. Lack of defined host makes getting seated a bit messy, lots of wait staff buzzing around, food not always coming out on time and together.   However, the environment is very comfortable, a home-like feel with Turkic elegance. The staff and owner are incredibly warm, happy and inviting.   The food was phenomenal. This was the best Turkish food I've had outside of Turkey. The soups were good (vegetable and Lentil). The Iskender was outstanding. Not crazy expensive either.  At the end of our meal, the owner treated us to some baklava, which may have been a top 5 baklava (I've had many). It went perfectly with the Turkish Coffee served in traditional cups.   And, it's BYOB!  Will certainly be back...",

Oddly she brought the gyro dinner to my friend, but quickly replaced it with the correct sandwich. I enjoyed my sandwich especially the yogurt. It was in nice bread and hot. I wished there was more ingredients since it was tasty but not very interesting. There also was just a small amount of yogurt... Could have had a larger or second container. Waitress was slow to fill water and to return for payment. Overall nice but not that memorable . I looked for grape leaves, hummus or other items that we could share but they were not on the menus we had. I also thought it was odd that they served us 2 pitas with nothing to dip or eat with it when we were getting sandwiches. I'd try again in the evening...",

Upon arrival we were greeted by a very friendly gentleman in a suit. During our entire meal he circulated the dining area making sure everything was up to his high standards.  Hilary's service was flawless. Our meals were more than fabulous, starting with the cold appetizers, grilled lamb chops, lamb kabobs and the eggplant special.  Afterward the Manager saw to it that we had two desserts..............this indeed is the best baklava in town served with a generous portion of whipped cream.  The other flan like dessert was complimented by our delicious Turkish coffees.  Everything is a plus there: decor, service, cleanliness, food quality and BYOB with only $5 for the corkage fee.  We will be returning with other guests as soon as possible. Thank you!",

The dumplings were not dumplings at all but heavy kind of bow-tie pasta pellets in a marinara sauce.  Be sure to ask about the description of the dumpling dish before ordering.  The owner was gracious enough to exchange the dish out when we weren't satisfied, which was to his credit.  The staff is friendly, but it is BYOB and the waiters charge $1.00 every time they open a beer and $5.00 for every bottle of wine they open.  When we questioned this charge the owner instructed the waitress to take it off the bill.",
