The service has been very good, but each time the tables were already being set up for close with chairs being put on tables. I feel lik that's a bit early and it discourages one from eating there. This is my lunch time at work and it would be nice if I could get out of work and eat there without feeling like a nuisance.   The food is great. I've never had a bad salad and i will always love Eat'n Park's chicken noodle soup. My favorite salad is the apple, almond, chicken salad. It's a little pricey but it's nice to have a healthy and quick option while working the 3-11pm shift so I justify it. I'll definitely be back and I would say this location compares to the Oakland location without all the students.",

I love that you can order on line and your order is ready when you arrive.  I love that they throw me an occasional coupon that makes me feel good about myself.  I love the tiny little Smiley cookies.  And I love that they also have meaty sandwiches and delicious burgers for my bf.  I only wish there were more soup choices.  Such a good place to eat!!",

Now it's worth noting, this is primarily a soup, sala, and sandwich joint so don't come looking for a great sit down experience or dinner.   I will say the sandwiches are reasonably priced, and okay, nothing amazing, but for the cost and convenience is okay.   Fries are definately worth splurging on, though one order could be shared by two people getting lunch.      The soda fountain has Boylan's soda, stepping up over the traditional Pepsi/Coke options.",

The portion was huge and I wasn't hungry for the rest of afternoon...no 3:00 PM pick me up after eating this delicious salad.  I went with the mixed greens with an avacodo and various toppings.  They have so many topping options and they are unlimited people...UNLIMITED!  And they're not stingy with the scoops!   I got the citrus lime vinaigrette which was refreshing and went perfectly on top of a salad on a hot day.   You can choose how small you want your salad chopped which was a great option that I didn't know existed and then you can get your level of dressing.  I chose heavy but maybe next time I'll go with medium.  This was all for $9!",

    "text": "I get a salad from here at least once a week.  I love it.  However, the past month has been a NIGHTMARE with getting my order and their long wait times. I order and PAY online so that I can just run in and grab my food and go.  It used to be that easy.  Something there has changed in the last month.  There is a line out the door just to pick up your food that you already ordered and paid for.   Today for example, I ordered online at 11:30.  At checkout, it said my food would be ready for pickup at 12:09.  I arrive at 12:10 and there is a line out the door.  The line doesn't move at all for about 10 minutes.  I finally was able to snag a worker that was walking around and asked \"My order is already paid for and was placed almost an hour ago, is it possible that I can just go up and grab it?\".  She went to look and came back and told me that they hadn't even started making it yet!  It wasn't until 12:30 that they had it done...and that's only because they moved mine to the front of the list since they knew I was standing there waiting. I've had this happen several times...hoping it was just a fluke or a bad schedule issue on their part with workers.  I even tried ordering before lunch rush and after to see if there was any difference.  But no, it's still happening.  I've even emailed and left feedback to the restaurant.   I get a response that they will notify the store manager. Unfortunately I have to stop going there even though I love their salads.  I can't take up my entire lunch break at work by just standing in line waiting for food.  The entire point of doing online order and pay is to be able to get in and out.  That is not the case here anymore.    Unacceptable!",

HB is clearly very popular, as it was packed when I walked in at about 12:10pm. My friend ordered a tandoor salad and was told it would be a half an hour to make. Whoa! I ordered the strawberry chicken salad and an iced tea, for a little over $11. The wait wasn't too bad considering how busy the place was. My salad was pretty good (I do wish it had more veggies in it) but I can't get on board with that price! The line for the online orders was insanity. I see someone else reviewed today and said it was 40 min long, I might believe that. I will consider returning in the future but will make sure to go early or in between lunch hours!",

    "text": "I frequent the downtown location and sometimes the McCandless one. The food is good and I always enjoy the option to order online ahead of time. However, the downtown one has never been great at having online orders ready for the time you pick, and the last time I was there it was worse than ever. I arrived about 5 mins ahead of my pick-up time, and thank goodness I did, because I waited in the line to get to the register for about 15-20. So when I got to the register I was already 10-15 mins past my pick-up time. I waited for another 5 until the cashier came to the counter, and then an additional 5 while she searched for my order, which ultimately had not been made yet. I had my daughter with me for lunch and was working in a relatively short window to get her fed and back to daycare, and me back to work (which is why I order and pay ahead of time). They said they moved my order to the front of the queue and told me they'd bring it out. We then went on the hunt for a table, and finally found one, only to sit and wait ANOTHER 20 mins for our food. Then when it arrived, the kid's meal was wrong and we had to track someone down to have it fixed. I stopped coming here because I couldn't take the waits anymore. I thought I saw something recently that they had changed the pick-up process so that credit card payments were required and orders would be waiting on a shelf for you to grab & go -- I confirmed the CC one but is the order shelf accurate as well? That would be so much better.",

The place was packed and growing more so each moment even despite the blowing snow covering the ground.  If that's not a good sign for a new place, I don't know what it.   Due to the weather, I didn't feel like a salad, so I opted for the grilled cheese and tomato soup - upgraded to an apple, bacon and cheddar grilled cheese.  Just what the doctor ordered on a frigid day.  The apples were crisp and sweet and complimented the nice mound of cheddar.  The bacon was crispy and not greasy.  The tomato soup left a little to be desired.  I think they could have put a little more effort into it - it was a bit like canned tomato soup, but it still did the trick.  I love the Boylan fountain drinks as well.   I will be back to sample probably a burger and see what tasty deliciousness is contained in their version.",

The service is quick and the menu options are unique and flavorful. My personal favorite is the Barbecue Chicken Salad because of its crunchy tortilla strips and delicious sweet-yet-spicy barbecue sauce. In the winter, I spring for the Winter Greens Salad, which is a nice light option when holiday meals have you feeling sluggish. The greatest thing about the Hello Bistro salads? They have the perfect dressing-to-salad ratio EVERY TIME! Probably because their unique chopping technique coats every lettuce leaf with the right amount of dressing. Obviously from my experience I have yet to try their hot food options, like their burgers and sandwiches, but I have stolen french fry or two off of my friends plates and I can say with certainty that Hello Bistro is just as good cooking hot food as they are crafting salads.",

It took us about 20 minutes to get there so we figured the order would be almost ready. We waited another hour. We were on our lunch break from work so we rushed back to the office with our order to discover that they made a mistake with almost everyone's lunch. Out of 5 meals they only got my order correct. Unfortunately, they undercooked mine.  The second time was just the other day (4/27/2016). Rather than call ahead we just went in and placed our orders in person. There were three of us this time. One person's order came out almost immediately, but he was missing half of what he had asked for. Our other two orders took over an hour to come out (just a salad and a hamburger - nothing crazy). We only got them because my coworker basically stormed their kitchen to get our food. The manager apologized and gave us two gift cards. We checked them today. The balance on both cards is ZERO.   The food isn't terrible, but it's definitely not worth the consistently bad service.",

Most tables where occupied and there was a line for food, but the line moved very quickly.  I approached the register, ordered the salad bar $7.95, add chicken for an additional $2 and quickly took my place in line to have an employee prepare my salad, to my liking.  I love the idea of a salad bar, where the employees prepare the food.  No germy customers touching the items.   The options are endless!   Lots of healthy options, starting with your choice of greens.  I chose the kale/spinach mix, but there was also spring greens and romaine to choose from.  I topped my salad with quinoa (yum!!), chickpeas and lots of other fresh veggies.  There were raw options and roasted options in addition there were 3 options for chicken, Tandoor, Fajita, or salt/pepper/garlic.  I opted for the latter.  My selection was then passed on to the next station where it was chopped, topped (I chose pepitas) and dressed.  I really enjoyed my salad, the portion and value was spot on.  I'll definitely go back!",

I decided on the Fiesta Chicken salad over making my own and paired it with a cup of the Potato Soup. After sitting down with my drink, about 5 minutes later my order arrived. The Portion of the salad is HUGE! I am a bigger guy and could only eat half saving the other half for later.  The soup was a perfect temp and helped with the cold snowy weather outside. The staff were all courteous and helpful and the atmosphere had a cafeteria vibe.   My friend had a Superburger with Fries and he also said it was good and reasonably priced.

I ordered the special salad, but the cashier was not familiar with the specials and had to go check to see how to ring it up.  I then waited 32 minutes for the salad.  That's right, 32 minutes.  It involved nothing special.  People behind me in line got theirs (rather unhappily) before me, about 25 minutes out.  I asked what was happening because I had an appointment and I was met with rudeness.    The problem is that people can order salads online and pick them up. I've done this several times to great success. But now I see how that works--it is at the cost of the customer that orders in the store.  I had to wait for dozens (literally dozens) of salads to be made for people that were not in line.  I have never seen so many people in such disarray and unorganized.  Everyone working there appeared to be confused and disoriented.   i will never go back.  It is not just the 32 minute wait for beets, precooked chicken, and lettuce to be mixed up, but the general rudeness and disorganization of the place.    I would avoid this place at all costs, unless you are ordering online.  If ordering online, it is a halfway decent salad.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that the food was good. I got a roasted root salad. My wife built her own. The little juice place attached to HB is fantastic. I'd recommend stopping over there. But the service at Hello Bistro... abysmal.  I purposely ordered and paid ahead online so that I wouldn't be stuck waiting long. It's a Friday lunch hour downtown - places get crazy. But when you order and pay ahead at places that offer it, you don't expect a wait... especially not 25 extra minutes!! And it wasn't just the long line at the take-out pick-up counter. When I finally got to the head of the line, our salads had JUST been made. They were supposed to have been ready 25 minutes earlier. So if we had been able to get to the head of the line when our food was expected to be prepared, we would still have been waiting for it to be made. The gentleman in front of me had ordered ahead as well. His food wasn't even ready. The response from staff? \"Yea. We're just hectic back here.\"  Every establishment is hectic at lunch on Fridays downtown. Get it together.  I don't know that I'll return.",

For about 8 bucks they will pack an unlimited number of vegetable, fruit, and crunchy toppings into a generously sized bowl for you. For 2 bucks more you can add meat. Then it is all chopped and dressed right in front of you. The end result is a fresh and filling salad. Its not the best salad you'll ever have but its nice to be able to load up on lots of veggies and toppings without breaking the bank.  FYI: This place becomes an absolute madhouse at lunch time. Its best to order online or show up well before the lunch rush.",

They open their garage door/windows in the summer time and it just smells like a really dirty wet rag when you walk past. It's as if they used one dirty rag to clean the entire place over and over again. If you can get past the smell, the food is ok. Otherwise, just make the extra effort and go to an Eat'n Park diner outside of downtown.",

    "text": "Why is this one so much better than the Oakland location?  I don't really know, but I can say that I'm happy about it.  I put my previous two terrible Oakland experiences aside, braved the new location in Downtown Pittsburgh, and walked away a changed man.  First attempt:  late lunch, 1:30 PM, mid-week.  The place was a ghost town (awesome!) I walked right up to the counter, ordered a Rachel burger, and was promptly delivered my burger in a few short minutes.  The burger was good, if not messy, and my only gripe would be that the turkey-burger patty is clearly from frozen.  Nonetheless, still a tasty meal and the place was really clean with super friendly employees.  Second attempt:  Noon, mid-week.  The place was packed and there was a decent sized line.  Service was still prompt and while the Salad Bar Engineers did look a bit frazzled, they handled my requests promptly.  Minor disappointment was the meager topping rations provided when I asked for a) chopped eggs b) bacon c) croutons.  If all salad toppings are free, why are you skimping on these things? (And I do mean skimp, like teaspoon size serving.)  Next time I'll be \"that guy\" and tell them to double up.    When I finally made my way to the Cold Stone Creamery-esque salad amalgamation station, I was presented with two options: \"Big bites or little bites?\"  Unhappy with such restrictions, I countered with \"medium bites?\" to a non-plussed chopper.  She did, however, comply with my clearly ridiculous request.    In all, the salad was very good and I'll definitely go back (only to this location).  Oakland-location still needs to learn that avocados aren't supposed to be dark brown when placed on salads and that sweaty forearms are not an appropriate salad tong resting station in-between grabbing items from the salad bar.",

I never take the time to write reviews but I had to call Hello Bistro out on this particular salad. Maybe something was going on there that day, but they are always super busy and you'd think the turnover of ingredients would keep them fresh, but they are far from it.

Surprisingly, I did get a few good bites of avocado- so why skimp on cheaper ingredients like beans and corn?

The quality is slightly better than your standard fast food fare, the prices aren't too bad for a regular lunch spot (although $10-12 for a salad that won't fill you up can really add up if you go on a regular basis), and the staff is usually nice.  Where this location falters compared to other locations is in consistency and order accuracy. Perhaps it's the INSANE lunch rush, but ordering ahead will result in an inaccurate order 90% of the time. Literally. My wife has almost never received an accurate order when ordering ahead. Breakfast, lunch? It doesn't seem to matter. They can't get it right. Unfortunately, unless you're looking to spend half of your lunch break in the crazy line, ordering ahead (and the possibility of doing so) is the way to go. Or, like we end up doing most of the time...we simply avoid this Hello Bistro altogether.  I would love to see this location work out the kinks, as being a locally-owned and operated chain is always great to support, but for the price and quality, the inability to get orders correct will likely drive some people away. Fortunately for Hello Bistro, the lines hint that they won't struggle, regardless of service quality...which means they won't need a reason to improve.",

Cashier worked the register with her gloves on, the same ones that were being used to prepare food minutes ago.

I've always been a fan of Hello Bistro since first going to the Oakland location when I lived there. Bobby fell in love with their salads and i dig the super burger and fries (& salads, but i'm more of a french fry person lol) I actually remember writing in my review for the Oakland location \"it'd be awesome if they put a HB downtown\". It's like I have a magic genie or something :O  The reason I waited a little for the review is because the first 2 weeks the wait time was a little long due to just opening and everyone checking it out. I didnt want to put in review that I waited forever for my food because I knew eventually it would be fine. But now even when it's busy, the wait time to get your food is not long at all.. so that's a plus.  They have specials here that I dont remember seeing at the other locations (forgive me if i'm wrong on that fact) You can get a grilled cheese, soup & drink for $6.99 or a super burger, fries & drink for $7.99. The grilled cheese was tasty and i've had it both with their tomato and chicken noodle soup. I felt the chicken noodle soup was really lacking chicken but eh what can ya do. The grilled cheese was fine and it helped my tummy a week after being sick and my appetite not getting back to normal asap.   I havent had a salad from this location, but every other location I experienced a great salad.  I'm so thankful and excited this is downtown since I spend 40+ hours a week here. I love the build your own salad idea and they have a lengthy list of choices to put on your salad. Check it out if you've never experienced Hello Bistro!",

The staff works very hard especially with the high amount of foot traffic and are always super nice even though it is always slammed during the lunch break when I go. Definitely recommend for a fast healthy lunch.  If you want to get a little unhealthy though, the fries are incredible.",

    "text": "Hello Bistro has the best fast-food salads downtown. There are tons of toppings and no limit to what you can add to your salad. Choose from fresh and roasted veggies, at least six different kinds of cheeses, a variety of proteins, and lots of yummy, crunchy add-ins.  It does get very busy at the lunch rush, and the counter can get unpleasantly messy during peak times. That's why I always go around 11am. Lately I've been ordering online as well.  I see a lot of reviews that say the salads are packed with lettuce rather than toppings. Well, if you get the kale mix, all those extra greens are a good thing! And just ask if you want another scoop of a certain topping. Staff have always been willing to do so in my experience.",

    "text": "I write this review with conflicted opinions...after a weekend of binge drinking and eating late night pizza, i enter the work week craving kale and mixed greens. Hello Bistro gives you the opportunity to order a pre-made salad, or create custom salads with a wide variety of veggies, fruits, crunchies and dressings available. Being that it is owned by Eat N' Park, the Super Burger is highly recommended as well. If you're into pop, the Boylan soda is LEGIT.   Having said that, if you want to get a salad during the hours of 11:30-1:30, which is the time 99% of us take our lunch breaks, be prepared to wait in line to order...and then wait in ANOTHER line to be served. I realize that it's a stressful job for some of the people that work there given the amount of people that come in on a daily basis, but I had to explain to the worker yesterday what jalapenos and cheddar cheese were. As you can imagine, this kind of service is why the lines are SO long.   There is the option of ordering online for pickup, but I like to see my salad being made in front of me and it tends to be bigger and better! Hello Bistro is definitely a very delicious, healthy and great place for lunch. I just wish there was more organization when I go there for lunch.",

While the salad itself was decent, it wasn't fantastic. The dressing wasn't sweet enough for the type of salad it is. The time spent waiting in line and to get my food for dine in was ridiculously long for 2:30pm on a Tuesday as well.  I also don't make it a habit to dine places where there is a lack of outlets to plug into. In 2017, to dine in a restaurant without any outlets is weird and inconvenient.  Will I be back? Sure.

It was a Friday afternoon-November 11, around 4/5pm and the place wasn't too busy but it looked like I had just missed the rush with the place looking a mess.   When it came to order the dressing, I noticed the amount first poured wasn't as much as I'd like and asked for a little more extra. The employee poured way more than necessary. He was nice so maybe he isn't a salad eater or maybe he made a mistake. Also, while this went on I was distracted by another employee at the end of the line eating croutons.   In retrospect I should've asked for a new salad but I decided to try it. Needless to say I had to throw it away after a few bites. Nothing worse than throwing away your lunch while at work. I emailed HB about my experience and was contacted after then but when I tried calling back after minutes of ringing my call was eventually disconnected.   Ultimately I feel like this falls on management. Keeping a clean restaurant, proper training of employees, and enforcing safe food handling standards is the job of the manager. The employee, again, was kind and I sincerely feel like he didn't realize the amount was way too much. Training employees better on serving sizes would help this issue. As for the cleanliness and employees eating around food-it's up to the manager to correct these issues.   I like the idea of HB and would love to see these issues resolved (also not a fan of the ordering process, paying first seems to slow this down-also it always seems to be understaffed). I would love to return but until changes are made I'm going to spend my money elsewhere.",

    "text": "Overall Impression: A BYO-salad emporium with reasonable pricing that includes classic E'nP menu items like the Superburger and delicious Potato Soup--smiley cookies included!  The Food: If you're looking for healthy(ish) place filled with customization, this is amazing even for the pickiest salad eaters. The BYO-salad bar is really what this place is all about. Not only are the toppings plentiful and fresh, but they REALLY pack them in there to give you a bountiful meal that will not leave you hungry. I've also had their soups (classic E'nP style) and a couple of their burgers over the last couple years, and I was always satisfied with how they tasted. My go-to burger (pictured below) is the Two Alarm Turkey Burger with added Avocado for some extra creamy-ness. It may look a little messy, but the messiest burgers area always the best. The tomato soup is thick and sweet--not going to lie, tasted like Campbell's from a can (processed), it could probably do with some more herbs/TLC. When I have indulged in their fries, they've been extremely greasy, and their burgers are more greasy than others I've eaten, but it's not to the point where it makes the food unappetizing.   The Restaurant: This location has a great takeout setup (I'd high recommend if you hate waiting) and in-restaurant salad assembly line. Flipping the usual \"eat, then pay\" model on it's head, the customer begins their salad journey at the register and pays for either an $8 unlimited topping (they mean it) salad or a menu item. You're then guided to the salad assembly line, setup Subway style, where you pick all the toppings under the sun, and you get your own drink (no servers). You sit with a number at your table and they bring your meal to you. The only reason this place gets 3 instead of 4 stars from me is their cleanliness. Every time I walk in here, there's food all over the floor, the trash is overflowing, and empty tables are dirty. I also have a huge issue with their salad-makers not wearing any head coverings and just pulling their hair back. I wish they'd wear hats or hairnets--there's no way 5-10 women go through an entire day without hair flying around. The takeout shelf is very hands-off. You literally walk right in and pick up your bag (check it!) and leave without speaking to anyone and avoiding the salad assembly line, it definitely runs smooth.  TL;DR BYO customized salad for a reasonable price or try a classic burger. You can get your EnP comfort fix while still trying to be healthy---ish! Just do yourself a favor and order online to pickup.",

After months of disappointment, I will no longer be coming here.  I cannot say that I haven't given this place more than enough chances... I definitely have.  My experiences in Southside and Oakland have been better, but this location, well, my experiences have sucked.  Whether I place the order online with ample notice of pickup , or order when I'm the sole customer there in the morning, my order has been wrong (more than a handful of times to say the least).  I was naive to think eventually things would improve and I kept giving them chance after chance.     The worst part of it is the unapologetic attitude that I received from a manager this morning upon returning to my desk with what was not my order.  I ordered a skinny scrambler without cheese and was given what I'm calling a filthy scrambler with cheese (and bacon).  If that's what I wanted, I would have ordered it. When I called, she said \"we knew that but you already left\"... And then just robotically took my info and said they may send me a gift card.  I even said there was no way I was coming back there, and she didn't even try to sound empathetic to my frustration.  I know that I may sound like I'm going a bit overboard, but this was like the 9th time that this has happened and I was very hangry...   If I get my gift card that \"may\" be sent, it will get used in Southside or Oakland where the Hello Bistro staff gets orders right and provides good customer service. If you can choose which one to go to, pick one of these as downtown is just lacking in terms of service and accuracy of order.",

The staff is courteous - even during the relentless lunch rush.  Slow service is an issue. Today it took 20 minutes to make, chop, and serve my salad. Hello Bistro has a great concept, fresh food, and a very interested lunchtime audience. I'd like to see them up their game on execution. Tip: be sure to order at the register before joining the salad line.",

    "text": "If you want to see a well-oiled machine at work during a busy lunch hour in downtown Pittsburgh, go to Hello Bistro. When I stopped in last week I watched about half a dozen workers on the salad bar alone, chopping away and making fresh salads for other customers. Not for me, however, as I opted for a single turkey burger that turned out to be very tasty. Juicy, covered with fresh veggies, and topped off with avocado sauce...talk about yum! And since the order didn't automatically come with a side of fries, as many burgers do, I was able to enjoy a fairly light lunch overall. Not easy to come by in downtown Pittsburgh.  That said, while I definitely recommend Hello Bistro for fresher and healthier grub, I don't recommend ordering anything other than salad during the lunch rush; it took a little longer to get my sandwich than a few of the other carry-out salad orders that arrived after me. I understand this, of course. It's a decent price to pay if it means that my food is being prepared as it's ordered, rather than in advance. And I didn't wait an insane amount of time at all. But it's still something to keep in mind if you're in a time crunch.  Good food, reasonable wait times, and staff that perform well under the pressure of a jam-packed eatery. Hello Bistro's a winner in my book. Go forth and dine healthily, diners. (Or don't: Hello Bistro's also known for making pretty tasty beef burgers!)",

They have a variety of burgers if you're feeling indulgent or many different salad options if you are feeling like being a little healthier. I really like the option of ordering ahead online to pick-up in store. It's great to avoid wasting too much of your lunch break waiting in line! This place does get VERY busy around noon, so I'd try to get there early or wait until after the rush if you don't have much time.  They have suggested salad combos or the option to make your own salad. I was very impressed with the options for lettuce, veggies, toppings and dressings. They do have a little something for everyone! The salads are pretty big, I wish they offered a smaller size because I am never able to finish it!  Their burgers are good too. I'd say it's a step up from a fast food burger, but not quite gourmet. I wish you could have the option to pick how you would like your burger cooked, but I also understand it would be difficult with this kind of set-up. They also have fresh-cut fries that are delicious.   Being the glutton that I am, one of my favorite things about this place is that they not only have a ketchup dispenser for fries, but they also have one for RANCH! I also love that they have Boylan's Ginger Ale!  If you're looking for a nice lunch option that you can keep under/around $10, this is a great place to check out!",

I ordered a Superburger Combo meal this afternoon, & specified two specific times to have my burger plain. The burger I got was certainly not plain & looked downright repulsive so I had to throw it away. This was after waiting an extra 30 minutes to pick up my food after mobile ordering. Luckily the food is cheap because I wasted my money.  I will never go to Hello Bistro ever again. If you work in Downtown Pittsburgh like I do, I encourage you to go anywhere else for lunch.",

    "text": "I used to love this place. It is so disappointing how badly it has gone down hill. There is zero sense of urgency if you go outside of the lunch rush. Recently I got a custom salad - no one in front of me - and it took upwards of 20 minutes before I was out the door. I only know this because I had to take it back to my desk to eat it because my lunch break was over. The staff likes to stand around and make jokes to each other, while the customer patiently waits and watches their lunch breaks dwindle away. I went two nights ago and got a caprese grilled cheese meal. The fries were very good, but the grilled cheese felt like it was put together by a 3 year old. It was soggy, butter soaked bread, with no sear on the outside. It was a mess. The flavor was there, but the execution was abysmal.. IT IS GRILLED CHEESE. I have to agree with some other reviewers, the line is a complete mess. Toppings all over the counter and floor, some toppings in other toppings pans. This place would be a nightmare for someone with allergies - or vegan/WFPB eaters because there is cross contamination everywhere.   I was getting salads from here a few times a week (I work across the street), but that has slowly diminished over time and I think it is down to ZERO from here on out. I have had it - I highly suggest anyone reading this review that was looking for a healthy option to go to Roots Natural Kitchen right across the street.   Hopefully Hello Bistro gets their act together because I also can notice a decrease in popularity at lunch time.",

Every time for the past at least 5 times that I have been there it has been a complete mess. Vegetable toppings mixed with other toppings, food smushed into the cutting boards, food all over the ground and a perished scent lingering in the air.  I was willing to look past this since this location is in market square and I know how busy they are because I pass by them almost daily around lunch but the pictures I took and the reason that I am writing this review is because these were taken at 6!! Plenty of time to get cleaned up IMO.  Sending caution to all the folks with allergies as the toppings mix!",

Choose your type of lettuce, add your toppings, pick a protein, tell them how you want it chopped up and what dressing you want and its done.  Be wary of the lunch crowd at this downtown location, as the line and wait time can get pretty long.  I usually go with mixed lettuce with Angry Shrimp and the Thai Peanut sauce.  Usually stick to the usual topping like strawberries, onions, banana peppers, ham cubes, chickpeas and mozzarella balls, but have been known to throw a curveball in there every now and again.  A good, filling salad that is better for you then most of the other quick lunch options downtown.  Also helps that my office is 4 blocks away, so a little walk makes me feel better about myself on top of eating a healthier salad.  BTW, they do have sandwiches and even the Super Burger available, but you can go to a regular Eat N Park or anywhere else for that.  You end up at Hello Bistro, go with the salad.

I am never disappointed with the amount of toppings they offer. Usually when I stop in, there are more options than the last. I always build my own salad and the employees always load it up! I do order almost all the vegetables and the somehow manage to fit it all in that plastic container. I've never had a bad experience at any of their restaurants. I've eaten here so many times, and will continue to!   There are not many places that you can order whatever you want on your salad without a limit of toppings (unless you're at a salad bar.)",

    "text": "I was walking downtown on an anomaly of a beautiful winter night in Pittsburgh. I just got in from Los Angeles and I was looking for something light and healthy to eat. I was enjoying the process of walking around and looking at all of the options and variety in Market Square, when I happened upon Hello Bistro. From the outside I could already tell it had healthy options that I would be interested in. It also looked pretty busy on the inside so I always take that as a good sign. I waited in line for a little bit as there was a few people in front of me, that  gave me a chance to read through the menu and make my choice. I decided to build my own salad. Once I got to the register, it appeared that the cashier had something else to do so I waited at the register for a while. When she got back, she took my order and I paid. Yet, nobody ever made my salad. I waited for about 20 minutes and she apologized and said \"it was busy.\" I finally got my salad about a half hour later to go. I chose mixed greens and salmon with vegetables, crunchies, and a squeezed lemon and apple cider vinaigrette dressing. It was delicious but there was so much lettuce I could barely taste the good stuff. Maybe that's how some people prefer their salad, I would rather have a small bed of lettuce and a lot of veggies and meat. The next morning, I was craving a breakfast sandwich and I was working at Point Park University. Hello Bistro is right down the street, I went and got their California breakfast sandwich. I was the only one in there, they had just opened and the girl was just prepping the food. It's took me about 10 minutes in total. There's also a restroom there that you need the code for. The prices are very reasonable. I paid $13 for my salad because I had to pay extra for salmon and avocado, and my breakfast sandwich was only six dollars. I live in Los Angeles so these prices seemed extremely reasonable to me. They do have indoor seating, but most people were getting theirs to go. The breakfast sandwich was way better than the salad, however I still probably won't return, I would take it or leave it! It is an easy solution and quick fix if you're in a hurry.",

This place is heaven for veg heads like me. Pile on as many fruit, veggies, and crunchies as you wish, don't be shy. If your salad is not mostly toppings, you're doing it wrong. I've been to this location several times, and they've never run out of anything I wanted. The ingredients are always fresh and delicious, plus the variety is insane. Salads aren't your thing? No problem! There's a whole menu of burgers, sandwiches, soups, and their freakin' awesome fries. Dip them in the E'nP ranch. So addictive!   Although the lines can get long during the lunch rush, the employees keep everyone moving at a very good pace. Previous reviews have mentioned that the restaurant can get dirty or smelly, but I've personally never had any complaints about the cleanliness. Just good timing, perhaps?",

But this place was a mess even the employees looked sloppy and handled the orders like a public school lunch lady.

The bun of the burger was so saturated with butter that it fell apart upon attempting to take a bite.  The greens on the burger looked like they had seen better days.  I suspect they take salad product that's past its prime and use that in the back kitchen to make the sandwiches etc to cut costs. Last time I came here the chili was really good.  This time not so much.  It was more a soupy bowl of beans than anything deserving of the title chili.  I would suggest sticking with the salad options.  Meh.",

This place also offered some indulgences in the form of burgers, fries & grilled cheeses, so it's the best of both worlds. Affordable prices too.  I've been to plenty of build-your-own salad places, but this one takes the cake! They have tons of ingredient options: fresh fruits & veggies, different cheeses, beans, crunchies & plenty of creative dressings (I tried the Agave Chili Lime...slightly sweet with a little zip, yum!). My only complaint was that a few veggies looked less than fresh (broccoli w/ brown edges, slimy mushrooms), but I could've just caught them on a bad day. They will chop the ingredients into small, medium or large pieces based on your preference & then toss with your dressing.   Another time I went in, I had the Broccauliflower Grilled Cheese...it was epic. Golden brown, perfectly crispy & cheesy. The chunks of broccoli & cauliflower inside added nice texture & made me feel a little less guilty about hoovering the whole sandwich haha. You could tell the fries were homemade...they sort of reminded me of In-N-Out Burger's.   Will definitely be back next time I'm in the 'Burgh!",

A gigantic salad with toppings galore and the most scrumdiddlyumptious ranch dressing known to man. Really, it's a good 2-3 meal salad, at least! For the price ($7.95 w/o meat) you really can't do any better. They do charge extra for chicken, shrimp or salmon, but really there are a couple meat-ish like toppings (ham, bacon) available with the salad that you wouldn't have to pay the extra couple bucks if you didn't want. And the burgers and fries are good too. The good morning burger with the egg and bacon is killer. The fries especially are also Homer Simpson drool worthy, but I love fries, so that's nothing new. I always order on line and pick up, which means I am no help as far as service or anything goes. I will say this place is PACKED around lunch time so I would suggest trying the ordering on line thing as well. Plus, when you order the first time online you get $2.00 bucks off your order!!",
