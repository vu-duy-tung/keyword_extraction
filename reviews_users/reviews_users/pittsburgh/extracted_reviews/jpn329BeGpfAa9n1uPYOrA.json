The first two times my eggs came to the table as over easy, you know if you were into \"dripping your toast\" over easy? The third time eggs came out with a soft yolk not hard but soft. The pancakes came out flat and greasy!!! The waitress and the guy  in the kitchen washing dishes were both cool however the cook was hot tempered and very rude  to his colleagues. I ordered a  simple dish two eggs, toast home-fries and a choice of meat, in addition two pancakes. The setting was not comfortable I paid my tab and I left and will not return...",

BYOB, so bring one of your favorite wines and enjoy with a delicious meal.   We started with some fresh cooked bread, the dough comes from Mancini's that's baked in house.  With the bread we received some olives, a dipping oil and Giada for a great start.   The menu has some interesting choices including a few specials of the day..a fresh sea bass, homemade ravioli and pasta.  The fresh pasta comes for Ohio City in the strip. We shared our meals and the paperdelle was a good choice.  The crab cakes were very good..a toasted red pepper aioli on top and some grilled veggies and potatoes on the side.  Almost forgot that we had mozzarella pomodoro for an antipasti; the mozzarella is made in house and is a great starter.  With our meal we had a choice of a house salad or soup.  I had the shrimp bisque and found it to be a little light on flavor.     Our server was very good, helpful and friendly.  Be sure to make reservations as all the tables were full.  We did arrive about 15 minutes early and our table was still being used so we spent a  few minutes walking around the neighborhood and window shopping.",

The crab cakes are suburb and I loved the roasted carrots. The Mancini bread baked on the premises is mouth watering served with a red hummus. Small, about 10 tables with BYOB, has an intimate atmosphere with Italian favorites music playing in the background. Jen, the waitress, is very pleasant and welcoming and very efficient.",

It's a tiny place (12 tables), the kitchen is right there - you can see them cooking the food order by order.  A delicious chocolate cake sits on the counter - you feel you are at Grandma's house for dinner.  Call for a reservation for dinner.  Breakfast and brunch are excellent too.  Amazing bread, meatballs, seafood.  It's BYOB - do not let that discourage you - take a bottle of wine and enjoy a fresh, amazing, perfectly crafted Pittsburgh dinner! I love it there!",

My wife ordered the CAPRESE $9 Roma Tomatoes, Garlic, Basil, & Housemade Mozzarella I ordered the CALABRESE $9 Labriola Sweet Sausage, Roma Tomatoes, Red Peppers, Onion, & Provolone   The eggs were so fluffy and the meal was HUGE! The basil with the mozzarella accented each other perfectly in my wife's dish and the Sausage with mine was absolutely delicious. Plus, EVERYTHING was seasoned perfectly, so you know you have a cook that cares. I ended up taking half home and I almost always finish my plate.   The server made you feel at home. Even knowing we had a groupon, he came back for refills and opinions several times.  We are excited to go back and the prices are very very reasonable, especially when it is really two meals. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE and I'm glad that it is on my way to work..",

As a displaced New Yorker, I was incredibly impressed  to find such a great Italian restaurant in such an inconspicuous place.    We ended up here on a whim and were beyond pleasantly surprised. We came into an intimate setting where every table overlooks the kitchen.  It's byo which ended well despite the amount of apps we ordered.   The relevant details are as follows: we got the mozzerella, sausage and peppers, crostelle and meatballs apps and everyone agreed to y were incredible. We each ordered different dinner dishes, however, the risotto, chicken parmesan and ravioli were all freshly made and we were so stuffed from apps that we were not able to finish dinner.   By the end of the meal we were so full and spoke with Frankie (ex chef/owner) and learned they had only been open for 3 weeks. We all literally gasped as more than half of us have worked in food service, we knew it takes more than 3 weeks to receive the  service, table side observance of food prep and quality of our dishes to be that pleased.   Overall, all of the ingredients are fresh, Frankie makes the mozzerella fresh daily (among other things including fantastic canollis) and a beyond attentive staff, I look forward to our next visit because not only is the food incredible, but thoughtful and delicious...not to mention that the staff are awesome.",

The staff is so friendly and as much as I try to drink my coffee as quick as possible, they make sure my cup is never empty! We noticed they just did a little bit of a food change in some of their menu items (I.e. The breakfast potatoes) and what a difference! The food has always been amazing, but now it's perfect. The breakfast portions are very generous (you will never leave hungry) and always cooked to order. We just love the family-style atmosphere of the place; every time we leave the chef always makes it a point to say good bye to his patrons #steelchef17! This place is truly a gem of the 'burgh.",

I even ordered a coffee that never came at any point during our stay.  Atleast 45 minutes passed before they even took our food order.  Which was ridiculous because there were 2 waiters/waitresses and they spent more time standing around then actually addressing the tables.  Once we realized that by the time we go out food and ate it would have been past 1pm (and we would have missed the kick off of the steeler game), we requested for the waiter to put our food directly in to-go boxes.  He mentioned it to the cook and we could immediately hear the cook complaining about the request.  Once a new table sat down, the waiter notified them that the kitchen was delayed.  Eventually we got our food, paid, and left.  To make the entire experience more infuriating, as we were leaving, the cook clapped which truly makes me never want to go back to this place.  It was a terrible experience overall",

Once our table was ready, we were seated quickly and our drink orders were taken.  Then the mess started.  I ordered herbal tea, and the small metal teapot for hot water they gave me was warped, causing me to spill hot water all over our table.  After we cleaned up, the waiter came over to take our breakfast orders.  Pretty simple: I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a croissant with scrambled eggs, Cheddar, and turkey sausage.  J ordered bacon, scrambled eggs, toast, and homefries.  It took them 45 minutes to bring our food.  Crazy because there were only 6 other tables with guests there.  We noticed that a few other patrons got their food orders late as well.  I looked into the kitchen (my chair was facing there) and noticed one of the cooks on her phone and the other two men engaged in a conversation.  Where was our food? After waiting, they finally brought out our food, which was mediocre at best.  As J would put it, \"We could have made this at home ourselves\".  Worst of all for J? We were there for over an hour and no one offered to refill his coffee, despite a waitress passing our table with a full pot multiple times.  When we got up to leave, we noticed that the 4 people that were seated about 5 minutes after us still were not served.  Needless to say, on to the next one...",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast/brunch because they were offering a Groupon ($34 for $18).   Atmosphere: Feels like you're eating dinner in a friend's grandmother's dining room. There's an open kitchen adjacent to the dining area. The dining area itself is small with ~10 tables.  The decor is mismatched with dark wood tables and light wooden chairs. Definitely informal.   Service: The first 30 sec after we walked in was awkward because no one greeted us and the space was so small. We were then told to seat ourselves. A sign by the entrance would help make that less awkward. It also felt short staffed, despite the fact that half the restaurant was empty, which translated into a longer than normal wait in between getting the menu and having our orders taken, and not getting silverware until we asked after we got our dishes. However, the service was very polite, and we got timely refills on coffee and juice.   Food: I got a pancake with chocolate chips and the calabrese fritatta. It was delicious! The portions are generous and the ingredients fresh. The pancake, with the toppings I ordered, cost $3 and was the size of a dinner plate. I probably could have just eaten that. We also got freshly squeezed orange juice, since our groupon came with unlimited refills. It tasted very fresh. However, it was served in a small glass (1/2 pint), which is pretty stingy for $4. Not sure if that was a Groupon thing or the standard size.   Overall: I'd definitely come back for the food, though I'd order less.   Side note: The Groupon was unclear that we'd have to pay for the orange juice (I thought it came with free orange juice, but it seemed like the refills were free but not the initial order-- we paid $4/person).",

The meatball appetizer was divine, loved the bread and various dipping sauces, and the seafood linguini was delicious. I'd recommend making reservations. Don't forget it's cash only and BYOB!",

    "text": "To celebrate two birthdays in my family, we made a reservation for 7 at Cucina Vitale. I heard the space was small, so we wanted to make sure we reserved a table. If you have more than a few people, I'd definitely recommend doing so because there approximately 10 tables. The restaurant is in the space where Caffe Davio used to be.   When we arrived, they had our whole table set with menus and water and we were greeted by a very friendly staff. It is BYOB with a minimal corking fee. We ordered the homemade mozzarella and the meatballs to start and they both were fantastic. This is a True Italian family owned business so do not be in a rush when ordering. Everything is made to order and we all truly enjoyed our meals! I had veal milanese with crab meat and a side of pasta. I was thrilled with my choice. Others in our party had the veal with peppers and the shrimp and scallops. Everyone raved about their meal. They kindly gave us two deserts on the house for the two birthdays we were celebrating.   This is a great addition to the South Side and we'll certainly be back!",

The breakfast menu is similar to that of the former restaurant (the basics are still the basics, but more expensive, alas) but more expansive now -- more egg options on the menu, etc.  The coffee is an improvement, but the french toast leaves something to desire for. The service is still friendly though Sunday breakfast is a long wait. One good thing is that it's no longer cash only as Caffe Davio was, and the dinner menu looks good. We'll be back.",

When we were seated in this relatively small restaurant we were warned that they have a from scratch menu with a small staff.  There  were a few other tables of people and a large party of six that was just seated before us. When we ordered we were concerned it was going to take all day to get our food. We were pleasantly surprised our food came in a reasonably short time and it was worth waiting for. We started with cappuccino's they were delicious but a bit more milk than I expected. We all had the build your own frittatas that were very good. I would love to take credit for the design, but I think it was mostly in the execution.  They give you well done home fries and toast with your entree.  The people next to us got waffles and pancakes and said they were great. The staff is very welcoming and after we were finished they came by apologized for how long the food took to come out and offered us a free desert. They said they were out of tiramisu and we choose the lemon mascarpone cheese cake with mixed berry sauce. The piece the gave us was huge honestly I think it was two slices and then they also brought over a piece of tiramisu, which it turns out they had. Both were off the charts good. I hope to get back for lunch before we leave on Wednesday to check out the Italian food. I hope the lunch menus is as good!",

I had heard a lot about this place when it was Caffe Davio, and was disappointed I didn't have the chance to try it before it closed... but much to my surprise, Cucina Vitale opened up with the same chef as Caffe Davio!    When I came here for breakfast, my dining companion and I arrived right after they opened at 8:00am.  By the time we left, it was obvious we had made the right choice:  every seat in this quaint, intimate restaurant was spoken for!  I ordered the lox frittata and was not disappointed in the least.  I love smoked salmon and never though to have it for breakfast besides a lox bagel... this frittata opened a whole new horizon for me! I ordered a hot tea with my breakfast and was pleasantly surprised by the variety of tea bags that I was presented with.   The staff on this particular day were all wonderful.  Pleasant, fast, and easy to chat with.    My dinner experience held the bar high.  I came here with my aunt and cousin to catch up on things over a bottle of wine (Cucina Vitale is BYOB!).  We started off with the meatball appetizer and the greens and beans.  The meatballs were huge, easily shared between the three of us, and had the perfect flavors throughout.  I'm usually one to avoid red sauces when I'm out to dinner (I swear by my family recipe!), but the red sauce that blanketed the perfectly cooked meatballs was superb.  I've never had greens and beans before, but could not stop eating the ones that our waitress placed in front of us.  Not too wet, not too garlic-y, and the beans still had a slight bite to them so it didn't feel like I was eating slop, which is what I always assumed greens and beans would taste like just based on other preparations I had seen.  I had the veal milanese for my entree and somehow managed to save enough room to finish about half before I had to ask for a to-go box.  The veal was nice and thin, with a beautifully fried crust, topped with tender lump crab meat and sauteed grapes.  Yum!  Our waitress was very pleasant and told us this place will make you feel like family.  A lot of people that came in for dinner while we were there knew the chef/owner Frank by name, which I always think is nice to see and a good indication of the kind of local establishment you're in.  I absolutely plan to be back here many more times and can't wait to try more of their menu!  All of their menu items, from the soups to the sauces, are made in-house.  You'll feel right at home here!",

Pipers Pub looked like a 1,000 person Frat Party had just dumped it's entire guest-list inside of it. And Waffles Incaffeinated had about 4 too many stroller-clad families waiting to get in. What's a hangry girl to do?!   The answer is Cucina Vitale. They have all your standard breakfast fare: eggs, breakfast meats, frittatas, pancakes, waffles, French toast, bagel & lox, and better than average diner coffee.   This is a small place. There are only a handful of tables, but we were able to get seated right away.   I had the triple berry waffle which came with fresh berry sauce and mascarpone. It was delicious! I've been getting let down by a bunch of dry and tasteless waffles around town, but this waffle was fluffy and flavorful. The side of turkey sausage was good too.   Service was a little slow and we had to ask for water/coffee refills a few times. But our server was pleasant and she apologized profusely for the wait time. A party of 9 was leaving just as we arrived, so the kitchen was backed up. Understandable.   All in all, this is a great place to grab a standard breakfast. I'll definitely be adding it to my Saturday and Sunday brunch options.",

    "text": "DISASTROUS BRUNCH.  Pittsburgh has a dearth of good places for a straightforward bacon, eggs, toast, coffee kind of brunch that are not Eatn'Park, so we were excited to find Cucina Vitale for brunch a few months ago, and we had a great experience then. The food was good, the price was right, and the service was pleasant.  Today, same waiter and same head cook - it was a disaster. There are only 30 seats in the restaurant, and it seemed that of the two waitstaff, only one (Kevin) was taking orders, and the other woman was mostly standing around and occasionally going around and pouring coffee. Good thing that the coffee was decent. Why? Read on.  Generally, an open kitchen concept is a great way to showcase a skilled and disciplined kitchen team. At Cucina Vitale, it puts dysfunction within earshot and eye contact and creates a dining experience where the kitchen stresses out the diners as well as the staff.  As we waited a few minutes for our table, I heard the cook say to the waiter, \"I don't want to hear it, because you're not back here\" - in the middle of waiting, I heard him say, \"I don't care\" (not anything you want to hear the person who's cooking your food say) - and by the end of the meal (finally) when I went to pay, it was him saying to the desperately overworked waiter, \"What the f#&% are you doing?!\" As a customer, I don't want to, nor should I have to hear this sort of language or see this sort of behavior.  I say \"finally\" because I'm pretty sure that the cook was cooking each order individually, and our entire dining experience for a simple greasy spoon diner brunch took an hour and a half - BECAUSE WE WAITED AN HOUR AND FIFTEEN MINUTES TO GET OUR FOOD. Like I said, good thing that the coffee was decent and it was refilled often enough.  None of this was worth it (nor was the cook's attitude necessary) for what's otherwise a simple, standard, classic brunch.",

Wonderful food at reasonable prices and BYO. Our group of 8 was well cared for. The Veal Chop was perfectly perfectly cooked, tender and delicious. The Ravioli with Bolognese was terrific and our friends enjoyed their meals as well. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "I went to Stagioni a few nights before dining at Cucina Vitale and I was very pleasantly surprised to find that Cucina Vitale's food was superior. The complimentary starter of fresh baked bread with olive oil, hummus (I think), and olives was excellent - the bread was soft inside and the crust had a pleasant crunch. The Linguini Branchio was very tasty as was the handmade ravioli. We brought our own bottles of wine and had an excellent dinner.  We liked our dinner so much we came back for brunch. I wasn't expecting much from an Italian place, but I live nearby so figured why not! Brunch was great! The frittatas were huge, the bacon was crispy, and the fresh squeezed OJ was tasty (especially with the champagne we brought with us). The bananarama waffle was delicious, but it is very, very sweet. Our table of 6 shared the waffle and it was a nice contrast to the hearty frittatas and other savory foods.  I'd definitely recommend Cucina Vitale for dinner or brunch. Hands down one of the best restaurants in South Side.",

    "text": "On Thursdsy 7/27/17 we were seeking somewhere different to try. We weren't sure exactly what we wanted so we hopped in the car and started driving. This is normally when we do our best work it seems. We drove around and called Cucina Vitale on a whim. They had an open table and we made our way down there.  Upon entering I was surprised how small it was. I personally am a huge fan of an open kitchen. It was great to see the chef skillfully preparing his product. It's evident there's a great pride in what he does. Plus, you can't beat the smells. We were seated promptly and brought over the appetizer which was a roasted red pepper hummus, seasoned dipping oil and olives with hot salted bread. Very nice.  I had the house salad and enjoyed it. The greens were dressed nicely, and the Gorgonzola cheese was just icing on the cake. She had the Caesar salad which was enjoyed as well.  I myself had the tagliatelle bolognese and decided to add a side of shrimp to it. The shrimp was grilled perfectly. If you enjoy grilled shrimp you know that it can go from perfectly cooked to rubber in about a minute. The bolognese sauce was nice, and what I liked about it in particular was that the vegetables had not been overcooked, or completely cooked down.   My better half chose the Chicken Marsala and choose wisely she did. It was really good. The sauce had a nice flavor. The potatoes were excellent. The roasted cauliflower was a nice addition which she enjoyed and she hates cauliflower. The down side to her meal was one piece of chicken was a bit lukewarm, while the other piece was hot. Minor gripe at best. To some, this would be a major turn-off.  The food is stellar as is the service. We got lucky being able to get in on such a whim. Reservations are highly suggested. Make one.  We chose to pass on dessert. Next time we'll give it a spin and there will be a next time!",

Their caesar salad is fresh like Will Smith; I add chicken for a filling lunch. I've gotten various pasta dishes which are all amazing and come with bread (homemade? and delicious). But my usual is the frittata, which is an eggy piece of heaven with home fries and toast. You can make-your-own if your picky, but I usually go with their frittata of the day. It's written on the board right outside, and changes daily. I love it because it's always random combinations that I'd probably not put together but are always delicious. I'm not sure why other people are commenting about long wait times - I've honestly only experienced that once in the 100 times I've been there. Long story short, come.",

Everyone agreed they were the best they'd ever had. The beans and greens were so flavorful and the fried mozzarella was perfection. We also got salads, linguine marinara, ravioli with chicken and veal parm. It was the perfect way to spend my birthday. Amanda was our server and she was lovely as always.

While the Groupon stipulated that we had to order a specific set of items, our nice waitress clarified that there weren't any restrictions, and that it could just be used as a gift certificate with the Groupon's value. So we ordered two lovely (and fancy!) entrees that were recommended to us. First was the ravioli special, which was the ideal size for one person and came with about 4 to 6 ravioli stuffed full with crab. The dish was super flavorful with the cheese and herb toppings, although it can definitely be improved with a bit more variety, e.g. in terms of vegetables.  The veal chop was the star of the show. First off, it was huge and definitely enough for at least one person and a half. The meat itself was tender and juicy, and there was so much of it all along the bone. The toppings of crab (again!) and grapes (a very cool choice) added to the decadence of this dish. While this is probably something I would never order on a regular basis, it's definitely one to get for a special occasion or for spoiling oneself. Even if not this, the rest of the menu is also very attractive, and service was wonderful as well.",

    "text": "TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!   We had called THREE times before going and kept getting the voicemail. I wasn't even sure if they were open & initially we wanted to place a to-go order. We said forget it and took a chance by deciding to just walk over. There are so many other options on the strip we knew if they were closed we could find another spot.   AS SOON AS WE WALKED IN WE JUST STOOD THERE... almost 5 minutes ... the servers just looked at us. A flimsy girl finally approached us & cleaned off a two top table.  As soon as we sat down at 1:20 the waiter (some guy that did not want to wait on us... I know because he goes \"so & so\" will be right over & ends up taking our order and being our server anyway) tells us \"we close at 2 PM, so you need to know what you want.\" I was so thrown off but I held my tongue and sat quietly. I already knew what I wanted because I had looked over the menu on YELP. We place our order (glad we knew what we wanted or we would have been shit out of luck).... he takes our order and my husband ordered an orange juice and me a water.... our waiter puts our order in and begins to clean.... he cleans for a good ten minutes & still no drinks. Other customers are looking around. I'm so upset at this point I call over the flimsy girl & say \"could we get water please...\" her response \"well, what did you order?\" At this point I'm in flames and just proceed to walk out. I was a server and worked in the industry for years. I get it your ready to close but this was our first time visiting. We just moved to the area and could have been regulars! You just lost 30 percent tippers & great conversation. Keep up the hard work you two.   By the way after ordering my husband had sprinted like a mad man down the street to take out cash because apparently they are cash only.  After reading the rest of the reviews, it seems they have good days & bad days. Hope you catch them on a good day.",

There were 5'of us dining and the waitress immediately greeted us and was very friendly and helpful combing a few tables to accommodate us.  The food was really good.  I had the mediterranean Frittata which was very good.  The home fries were amazing the rye bread was very good and different.  My son got the Bananarama which was a combination of hot cakes and banana and walnut and was amazing!  Overall the wait staff and entire team was so pleasant and helpful it made for a very nice meal and experience.  Looking forward to coming back here when I am in Pittsburgh again.  As the restaurant is BYOB, the next I come I would absolutely bring a bottle of champagne as two other tables did for Mimosas.",

Very hospitable staff provide you orange juice or a bucket of ice for your drinks that you may wish to bring in. Great prices on excellent breakfast dishes in the neighborhood of $8 -$9. For toddlers, Alex, pancakes, or eggs the way you like them. Have also been for dinner several times which is a delightful experience as well.  Cash only though!",

Better to know beforehand or you walk a couple blocks to an ATM to get money and ATM fee'd, etc. etc.  The place is a little smaller too so if it's busy you can give your phone number/name and they'll call you (but if you miss it, they will probably give your table away to the next in queue).   Came in on a Sunday and the breakfast wasn't too bad. Smaller menu but overall pretty good. Nothing really that special but maybe I missed something that they specialize in. Other people seemed more than satisfied with their food.  Coffee was pretty good too without adding anything and it's always fresh! Big plus for me.",

They also had a groupon which made me even more tempted to try it out. I went on a Sunday, for brunch, and was NOT disappointed.   The location is small, but it gives it a wonderfully intimate feel when you can see the kitchen and everything as almost part of the dining room!  Everything is scratch made, so maybe the food took longer to come out than other places?  If it did I didn't notice as the byob mimosas were keeping us busy.   I ordered the berry waffles. The berry sauce was absolutely incredible, thick and just wonderful. The cream on top added to the decadence. My girlfriend ordered the build your own frittata which she also very much enjoyed.   This experience has me very excited to try dinner here. The prices are VERY reasonable. Very very reasonable. Of note, they are cash only. (There's a PNC atm across the street so you're ok)   I cant recommend here enough!",

The best Caesar salad I've ever eaten. My hubby had the linguine bolognese, he could of licked the bowl. I had the veal parmigiana and had quite a large serving, enough for another full meal for the next day. Dessert was a lemony cheesecake with mounds of berries.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I had a late dinner here last night. Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had in Pittsburgh. This is located on the far end of South Side on Carson St. I love the location, with easy to find parking, and the bar crowd a ways away. We arrived about 10 minutes early for our reservation, and had to wait for our table to open up. We were sat right at 8:30, which was perfectly timed by the restaurant. We brought 2 bottles of wine with us since this restaurant is BYOB (ALSO CASH ONLY). This is a smaller restaurant, I believe it seats around 30 people at a time, so the 2 servers were working together and tag teaming all tables, which worked flawlessly. Service was impeccable.   One of my favorite things about this restaurant is the fact that it has an open kitchen, where Frank and his kitchen staff can really put some love into each and every dish. The team seriously seemed to work perfectly together. From bread service, to dessert, everything was timed well without too much of a rush or too much of a wait. Bread is served warm with a couple of offerings for dipping and some imported Italian olives. Great start. We showed up hungry because we knew we were about to get a lot of food based on other reviews. We started with the Mozzarella Pomodoro. Three large pieces of a pan fried mozzarella, over a rich, velvety, Campari tomato sauce. The first bite of our appetizer, we knew we were in for a treat.   Dinners here come with soup or salad, and roasted potatoes with the seasonal veggie. I ordered the Veal chop, chargrilled with a rosemary jus. The veal was phenomenal, perfect grill marks and excellent flavor. My girlfriend ordered the crabcake entree. The crabcake here, is THE BEST crabcake I have ever had. Her dinner blew me away, huge pieces of jumbo lump crab, barely any filler. I forgot to ask what the sauce was, but it was some kind of aioli or remoulade and it worked very well with the crabcake. They have a wild mushroom risotto on the menu as an entree, but we really wanted it as a side, and the chef was quick to accommodate with a half order to go with our entrees.   As I mentioned earlier, entrees came with soup or salad. She had the wedding soup, and I had the lobster bisque - both great. I ordered a Caesar salad w/ anchovy between my soup and entree course and the house made dressing was SO GOOD.   We couldn't finish Vday dinner without dessert so we had the chocolate cake with a rich chocolate buttercream frosting, which tasted almost like a mousse - great finish.  I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant, they also make fresh raviolis in house, which I wanted to try, but there were too many other things jumping out at me as well. Cannot wait to return!",

    "text": "Terrific little gem located between the South Side Flats and Carson neighborhoods in Pittsburgh. My wife, son, and I had brunch there on a Sunday morning. We ordered a create-your-own frittata (all veggie), the Mediterranian (frittata with kalamata olives, mushrooms, spinach, shallots, and feta), and The Basic (scrambled eggs and sweet Italian sausage). The food was fantastic. The open kitchen is no more than 10 feet from the farthest table, so you can see, hear, and smell your food being prepared.  Very attentive service. I appreciated the wait staff emphasizing the fact that the restaurant only takes cash.",

    "text": "I found a groupon for this spot that was $16 for breakfast for 2 people and unlimited OJ. This place is BYOB so the fact that we could get breakfast and mimosas for $8 was a steal!   This place is tiny only holding maybe 10-12 tables? There was a bit of a wait when we first got there maybe about 15 mins. There was a larger group in front of us that was waiting for maybe  30 mins. You can see straight through to the kitchen and they squeeze their OJ fresh so there was a bit of a wait for that.   The portions are big. I couldn't eat all of my food. But all of the food was fresh and delicious. But the OJ for mimosas was my favorite part!",

    "text": "My wife and I ate breakfast here about a year ago with a groupon, and while we liked the atmosphere I was slightly disappointed in the food (the frittata was a little too salty for me).  We decided to try it again with another Groupon, and this time was better. My wife's eggs were done perfectly, the fruit was fresh, and the ham was lean and cooked well. I decided to get a frittata with hot sausage and mozzarella, which was made fresh and had good flavor. Everything was good and the coffee was always refilled. We recommend it for anyone with nothing to do the rest of the morning, because it takes a while. But that's what \"made to order\" means, so well worth it.",

    "text": "Brunch was a bust. It took forever to get our order in. Servers were too worried about cleaning tables for new guests rather than taking care of the ones who had been waiting forever to order.  I went with the banana waffles which had bananas and walnuts. While it was good, it was completely drenched in syrup. The waffle was completely soggy and eventually became inedible because of how sweet it became after it soaked up the syrup. I would've been satisfied adding my own syrup. My boyfriend ordered the salmon bagel. It looked good but for whatever reason he didn't care for it. He said salmon tasted off. We each ate about 3 bites then paid and left. Thankfully it was a Groupon.  Ill skip brunch here but the crab ravioli looked fabulous.",

I tried to call and give them a heads up about my large party of seven as we were on our way to the restaurant. She told me they \"didn't take reservations.\" I told her I wasn't trying to make reservations. When she condescendingly called me \"honey,\" I turned the car around and our whole party went somewhere else.",
