I'll never forget the stuffed zucchini blossoms: lovely! Monique is a gracious hostess. The restaurant used to be a garage -- check out the ceiling. Love it when they open the wall in the summer. Cash only. BYOB. Just off Ellsworth. Don't know if they treat everyone like family, but that's how they treat us. Highly recommended.  (10/20/13 Although the food stayed consistently good it's not quite the same now that hostess Monique is gone.)",

    "text": "This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table, it was necessary to sit uncomfortably in order to avoid being bumped by anyone that walked by, which happened repeatedly as we were in a busy thoroughfare of food delivery.  No other table offered a much better situation and all others were occupied at the busy time we arrived, 6:45 p. m. The online menu boasts of a daily vegetarian and vegan special entree, but there was no such entree on this night.  There was only one non-meat item on the small menu, ravioli.  Our gracious server, Ramon, said that the kitchen could prepare a couscous and vegetable dish if the vegetarian in our party wanted it, and that was what we did.  The restaurant permits customers to bring their own alcoholic beverages, a nice convenience and savings for the diner.  A small portion of bread was served with a tiny amount of rock-hard butter.  My mushroom and cheese soup was a large portion, served piping hot, which was great, but it was a puree with no distinct mushroom pieces.  I would not have been able to distinguish it as mushroom soup.  All of our entrees were attractively presented and were tasty, average size portions.  All were served with a small amount of good, fresh vegetables. It would be helpful if the menu offered some description of the following entree so that the diner with an interest in a chicken dish would not have to inquire about it of the server:  \"chicken maputo Roasted w/ piri piri & chocolate scented sauce\".  Does the average diner know what \"maputo\" and \"piri piri\" are? The lemon tart dessert was a small piece not suitable for sharing, served with two minute pieces of strawberries and a small dollop of whipped cream.  It was not flavorful or moist nor worth the calories.  The gracious owner, Tony Pais, stopped at our table for a moment to greet us, a nice touch, and there were quality checks by a manager and Ramon.  I noticed a number of prominent people from the community dining here, individuals whom I was surprised were willing to spend a good deal of money to be packed into a sardine can of a restaurant.  Apparently they consider this to be the only restaurant in town.  The rest rooms are small, one-person facilities, naturally. An unfortunate surprise occurred when the individual that was picking up the check for my party presented his credit card only to be told that the restaurant accepts only cash and checks, this for a tariff of $148 plus gratuity.  It is supposed to be of some consolation that there is an Automatic Teller Machine on site.  I imagine less than 1% of expensive restaurants today are cash only.  Cafe Zinho is a highly flawed restaurant, demonstrating that there is more to a fine dining experience than simply offering fine cuisine.  If one is able to get beyond the feeling one has when visiting the rest room on a commercial airliner, the diner might enjoy it: not us.  I posted comments about the restaurant at its Facebook page, in which I noted my displeasure with being cramped and uncomfortable, and about the restaurant being unique in its unwillingness to accept credit cards for a $148 check.  An individual identifying himself as the manager, who apparently had never received constructive criticism from anyone, initially demonstrated rage, posting a message that I can go to the Oiive Garden the next time I dine out.  He later added with similar condescension that I can use a coupon and a credit card at The Olive Garden.  Later, he thought better of his outburst and removed the comments...along with mine.  He ultimately offered me and my wife the opportunity to return to the restaurant at his expense.  I thanked him for the offer, but told him that one experience at Cafe Zinho was enough.  I had no intention of returning even if he had responded to my comments like a gentleman.",

    "text": "I definitely got the best service of the restaurants on Ellsworth from this restaurant, and they also offer the best food for the price.    The menu is creative and dinner (soup, salad and salmon) were delicious, but there is nothing that Portugese about this place (except the decor and a very sweet older lady hostess who may in fact be Portugese).  In fact, I think it would be considered a national security threat in Portugal to have a place that serves dinner NOT serve wine.  The government of this state is partly to blame though.  Since when did PA become goddamn Utah?!  But Rendell's gotta get his cut I guess...  Anyway, the place is small and intimate, one server handles the floor.  Minus points for the lack of alcohol,and frozen butter with the bread, but this restaurant is a neighborhood gem.",

Don't forget dessert we had bread pudding and cookies and cream. We went on Valentines weekend so the price was higher than usual. Also like Byob although they charged 5 dollar corkage fee it is worth it to bring your own choice of wine. There is also fee for sharing plate but again worth it.   Will definitely go again.",

Brought along  two  bottles of wine, which is such a nice bonus. Much cheaper and we were able to bring wines that we enjoy.  The decor is lovely, very bohemian and cozy.  Just magical.  Our server was Bulgarian and very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials.  The food is Portuguese, which is primarily fish based, so we ordered accordingly. To start we ordered the cod fritters, the grilled octopus and a special salad of the night, farm grown tomatoes with Roquefort cheese.  All very delicious!  Main courses were lamb burger with caramelized onions and provolone (tremendous flavor), the impeccable seafood stew and the salmon, also lovely.  Just a perfect relaxing meal in every way.  If you live in Pittsburgh and have not been, this place is a gem. Worth checking out.  Wish we lived closer (we are DC based).",

For entrees, I had a grouper filet with a cucumber mint sauce and a cous cous. It was a subtle dish but very fresh and tasty. My girlfriend had a chicken dish in a great red pepper sauce. The entrees come with these nicely grilled vegetables -- everything tastes really fresh.  The Tres Leche cake is incredible!  Great artsy atmosphere with friendly staff. Like previous reviewers have said, it's eclectic but not over the top, and it has a warm and personal vibe. The owners gave us wine. :)",

    "text": "Despite the torrential downpour on Saturday evening, we decided to try a new restaurant.  My girlfriend and I went back and forth (as we usually do), and finally decided on Cafe Zinho in Shadyside.  We had heard good things from a few friends, and were ready to give it a try. We arrived at 7pm, and the restaurant was packed; there was a two-top right next to the door, so we took it.  After a few minutes of contemplating our undesirable seating assignment, we asked to be moved away from the entrance.  The hostess obliged, and seated us in the center of the room- a much better destination.  The decor of Cafe Zinho can best be described as \"shabby chic\" with decorative light fixtures, colorful chandeliers, and warm-mismatched colors on the walls. The menu at Cafe Zinho is small; there were probably eight different entrees to choose from with two nightly specials,  six appetizers, and three desserts.  Before we chose our entrees, we decided to have an appetizer; steamed mussels with tomato-cilantro broth and toasted crostini.  While were waiting for our appetizer to arrive, our waiter brought us some warm crusty bread with ice-cold butter squares.  The yeasty rolls were a great prelude to our meal- warm and tasty, but not too filling.  Our mussels were served next. The mollusca were exceptional; cooked perfectly so that the flesh was tender and juicy.  The tomato-cilantro sauce was a nice accompaniment as well.  The sauce was finished with some unsalted butter; perfect for lapping up with our left-over rolls. Salads were next. We ordered the house mixed greens with feta cheese, grape tomatoes, toasted pecans, and lemon vinaigrette.  The greens were bitter, as was the dressing.  Some honey, or a sweet currant would have been nice here- something to cut the acidity.  The pecans were burnt; I didn't bother with them. For our entrees, we chose chicken with roasted pepper sauce, spring veggies, and red potatoes.  My girlfriend opted for the buffalo burger (cooked medium) served with chips and homemade cole slaw.  After 40 minutes our server came over and apologized for the delay, \"The Chef accidentally over-cooked your burger, it will only be a few more minutes.\"  In translation, that usually means, the Chef forgot to fire your burger... you're going to have to wait.   Finally, 20 Minutes later, my chicken dish arrived- by itself.  I waited for a few more minutes until the burger was served.  I glanced over at my girlfriend and notice a horrified look on her face.  \"What's wrong?' I asked.  She turned her plate to face me, and I saw it.  The meat was rare on the inside, and that wasn't the worst part; a huge stream of viscous blood had streamed out of the buffalo meat and saturated the bun.  The meat was sent back, of course, to be re-cooked.  My chicken was ok.  The meat was over-done, but the roasted red pepper sauce was flavorful.  The Swiss cheese on top of the chicken and under the sauce was cut thick, and didn't have a chance to melt.  The red potatoes we soft and moist and the baby green beans were sweet.  The buffalo burger was brought back to our table.  It was now cooked well (instead of medium) but the meat was palatable.  The cole slaw was unseasoned (where's the sugar, salt, and pepper?). Feeling guilty, our server offered us dessert \"on the house.\"  We took a piece of chocolate cake to go. We didn't have a good experience at Cafe Zinho.  It's too bad, because we were really enjoying the vibe of the restaurant.  Everyone is entitled to an off-night, we'll have to go back and give it another try.",

It's situated on a nice residential block near a large liquor store (byob).  The ambiance is fantastic and the staff are warm, friendly and attentive. We were seated in the private back room because no other tables were available. A real VIP treatment.   For starters, the goat cheese pastry and smoked salmon appetizers were to die for. Many of the others sounded great too.  Our daughter, who is at college here, was missing some of the food options of NY. Not any more. She had the lamb burger with feta cheese. I had the seafood stew and my wife had Chilean sea bass.  All fantastic! Thankfully we had just enough room for tres leches dessert. If anyone knows of a Portuguese restaurant this good in NYC ... or even in Newark Ironbound I'd love to hear about it.  We will definitely be back!",

Deserts by Becky are always excellent.  And who would have thought such excellent food would be served out of a redecorated garage?  (It's lovely in the summer when they open the garage door.)

    "text": "Shopping at Whole Foods this afternoon made us hungry and as we had no plans for dinner, my wife thought of Cafe Zinho, which is nearby.  I called and they said they were quite busy but if I could get there quickly, they had an open table for us.  Before hanging up they reminded me to bring a bottle of wine if I wanted one.  We made a quick stop at the nearby wine and spirits shoppe, bought a Spanish red, and showed up at Cafe Zinho.  They offered us the choice of two tables and immediately opened our wine, and brought over two nice stems.  The waiter gave us menus, described the daily specials and gave us time to mull it over.  We both ordered the soup of the day, a pumpkin bisque, my wife just ordered their Zhino side salad as her entree, and I chose a lamb burger (not Elysian Fields lamb, I asked).  Our waiter brought us a basket of what I suspect to be Portuguese bread.  It had a delicious sweetness. Our soups came out fairly quickly.  The bowls held a hearty serving of the delicious (and filling) cream soup.  After clearing our empty bowls our waiter bought out our entrees.  My wife's side salad was large, as side salads go.  She was quite pleased with it.  It had baby greens, tomato, olives, hearts & reduced red wine vinaigrette.  I had a taste and agreed with her assessment.  My lamb burger was huge!  It was at least an inch thick and was topped with feta and fruit chutney.  It came with a salad that filled any remaining space on the plate not taken up by the burger.  Note to self- do not order a salad if you're going to order the lamb burger!  I ordered the burger cooked medium-well, even though the waiter sort of tried to talk me into medium.  It came out just the way I wanted it, with just a hint of pink in the middle, and full of delicious juices.  My wife agreed that it was extremely yummy!  I cut the burger in half and managed to eat one of the halves along with about half the salad before I ran out of room.  My wife made it about halfway thru her salad by then, and she too gave up.  We asked for doggie bags and our waiter packed our meals up in containers and put them in a plastic bag for us.  It was a very nice meal and dining experience.  We noticed that the hostess greeted most people who came thru he door by name.  Obviously there are a large group of regulars who dine here often. Pros: BYOB, tasty food, reasonable noise level, outdoor sidewalk dining is available seasonally, friendly and attentive service (if a bit unpolished). Cons:  Ambience (it originally was a gas station) and there is nothing fancy about the funky decor, tables are packed every which way into the available interior space.",

We ordered the mussels as an appetizer, but when they came out they smelled terrible. We each tried one just to give them the benefit of the doubt but stopped eating for fear of getting sick. Our waiter agreed with us on the smell and took them back. He then suggested we try something else (the special scallop app). We agreed thinking this would be on the house given the mussel fiasco. Wrong - charged full price, twice what the mussels cost.   The rest of our meal was mediocre. The scallops were fine though slightly underdone (cool on the inside). My trout entree was quite tasty though the potatoes were borderline raw and the flavors were nothing special. My boyfriend's stuffed pork chop was overcooked, bland and drowning in salty gravy.   The butter was frozen (as mentioned by others) and the rolls were warm and nicely crusty on the outside but cold in the middle.   Needless to say, we skipped dessert. Wish we had returned to Cafe du Jour or Pusadee's Garden, two recent successes, rather than try this place.",

    "text": "Very trendy cool out of the way place that I definitely suggest you check out.  This is a Tony Pais restaurant, he owns another more formal place downtown but I forget the name.  He used to own Baum Vivant on Baum Blvd.  This was a great place.  The last I was there was 7 or 8 years ago.  It was total formal fuu fuu fine dining, but what an experience.  Anyways, it's gone now and I haven't been to one of his places since until last night when a friend suggested we try this little oasis located on Spahr St.  This place is the opposite with respect to atmosphere than Baum Vivant.  It's in a converted garage with a few outdoor tables.  It's cash only and BYOB.  It's very informal and I got away with wearing tennis shoes and my \"Super Size My Foie Gras\" fruit of the loom t-shirt.  Don't need to get dressed up to enjoy amazing food.  The inside of the restaurant/garage has a high ceilings and an eclectic mix of non-matching tables that I imagine were collected from Thrift stores.  The service was awesome, spot on from start to finish.  The lovely european women who served and hosted had big smiles and a genuine appreciation when we said we liked the food.  The meal started with some warm rolls that they may cook on site.  It was served with ice cold butter.  That's fine, but let's get a little more creative people on the butter, dips with the bread.  The first course was this amazing artichoke soup.  This literally is the best soup I've tried since I can remember and I eat out all the time.  The flavor was layored with the cream, maybe nutmeg, maybe spinach, and also what tasted to me like a shellfish broth.  It was a very complex flavor.  Amazing!  Next was a goat cheese dish served inside of phyllo dough.  It was tasty, but a little too rich for my taste.  The inside of the dough had apricots mixed with the goat cheese and the sauce was some type of combination of walnuts and apples pureed'.  Interesting, but didn't add too much to the dish.  Also, we tried a smoked salmon appetizer served on croutons with capers.  It was perfect and I really like their portions here.  They don't try to kill you with the size of the dishes.  My friend ordered the crabcakes, which were two small mostly lump crabmeat portions.  They were delicious served with a mushroom cream sauce.  The rice that was served with the crabcakes were another story, totally tasteless and not seasoned well. The rice was also a liitle mushy.  I tried the Elysian Fields lamb burger.  I had never seen an Elysian Fields lamb burger, so I thought I'd give it a try.  It was a decent portion (4 oz. I'd guess) at a reasonable price $11.  I didnt' really get to tell the difference between regular lamb and Elysian because they overcooked the burger to well done and it lost much of the flavor.  Overall, I'll stick to Tessaro's for my burgers.  We finished with a chocolate mousse, which was okay but I thought too heavy for a mousse.  I got out of here with a $65 + tax bill for all this amazing food.  What's even better is that because it's byob I probably saved $30 for the bottle of wine as well.  I really like the fact I can have interesting food, relatively cheap in a casual atmosphere.  One last thing, they don't have AC so you may want to pick a cooler night if you plan on sitting indoors.  They also say they don't take reservations on the menu, but we were able to make a reservation on Sunday for Monday for two people.",

The waitress was an adorable woman who was so friendly, helpful and enthusiastic about the dishes in a quiet manner. You just wanted to pinch her cheeks or something. Anyway she gave us some bread which was sweet, unlike many of the other restaurants breads that I have had, which I enjoyed. We ordered the goat cheese for an appetizer which was just so ooey and gooey deliciousness and then for the piece de resistance ordered the sea bass special that night which had capers, a potato, rice and some roasted vegetables. Great light combination and not too heavy. The size of the sea bass was like of the entire whole fish. To top it off we had the rice pudding dessert which was similar to flan but I thought this was so tasty. I kind of want one right now as I am typing this review.  I am so glad I went to Cafe Zinho finally and would happily come back here again.",

The cold prickly pear soup was certainly a good choice of appetizer. The service was acceptable and the staff very welcoming. The only downside to this place is the atmosphere. It can get extremely loud at times (especially when you are sitting next to a party of 12) and it becomes rather difficult to have any table conversation.",

    "text": "We stopped by for the first time on a cold Friday night around 9:30. We made sure to have reservations, as the place is pretty small. It's BYOB and we didn't bring our own wine because we weren't in a drinking mood, but once we sat down we realized this was the kind of place where you needed a bottle of wine. The decor is like an slightly charming mess of old furniture, clean table clothes, and scarves draped over the windows of the converted garage. We sat right by the door and right under the old dresser that the owners stand at.   The food was good. We ordered the tomato garlic bisque, which was delicious. The stuffed peppers with crab and goat cheese were tasty, but the plate was super hot and the peppers were cold, so that was a bit off. For main courses we ordered the salmon and the lobster ravioli. The salmon was great. It w cooked well and had a dill cream sauce on it. It was supposed to be served with risotto, but instead came with a dried cake of old creamy looking rice. I ignored that and ate the steamed and grilled veggies they used to garnish the plate. The lobster ravioli was amazing, but instead of coming in it's own sauce, they simply poured on the tomato garlic bisque that we had already ordered as a first course. After reading mixed reviews about this place, I was pleasantly surprised,   This place was a hot mess with slightly cold food, but I really liked it.",

Before I go further, THEY ARE CASH AND PERSONAL CHECK ONLY.  I want to point that out as I am someone who usually has little cash on hand.  The ingredients were very fresh.  We had the pheasant tartine - I've never had tartine before - kind of like a pate, but more firm - almost like cold head cheese consistency.  Also my date had the puff pastry with mushrooms, which she loved.  Our entrees were very good as well - a full rack of lamb for me, and she had the bronzino - both cooked very well.  The skin on her bronzino was crispy and very tasty - and both entrees were well seasoned and cooked perfectly.  This place is also BYOB.  We will be back someday.",

    "text": "Cafe Zinho is a quaint little spot tucked away in the hidden corners of Shadyside.  I have driven by it many times without even realizing it was a restaurant.   Thankfully, my more knowledgeable girlfriend recommended checking it out, as she had to buy me dinner. Cruel world, I know.  We were able to get an early reservation on a Saturday, pick up a bottle of wine ( a must!) and make it relatively on time. Intimate is precisely the word I would use to describe this living room dining experience. The waitresses are what you would want your host mom to be like from a foreign country, and splendidly cheery.  We ordered two apps, both delicious. They also served some impeccable cornbread as well. The first app was a pastry sort of thing covered in goat cheese, that was worthy of plate licking, had it been socially acceptable. The second was a batch of clams in a fragrant tomato sauce (the sauce also went well on the goat cheese pastry). Most of the time when I order clams, they are far too fishy, but these were perfect.  The lady friend ordered the special, a quail dish, while I ordered lamb osobuco. The portions were very generous, and you could easily see the care and prep that went into each individual dish. I must say, the quail was divine. I ended up super jealous and contemplated tricking the gf to turn around so I could switch plates while she was distracted. It was a mixture of sweet and layered with spices, the meat juicy and rich.   The lamb was textured and cooked very well, however it seemed to lack a distinctive flavor to bring out the qualities of the meat itself. Perhaps more garlic or such.  Either way, I will return, maybe with some Portuguese phrases in hand to banter with my adopted foreign mom/waitress.",

A few months back, my husband and I randomly decided to give it another try, and boy am I glad we did!  It's fantastic, and has quickly become part of our regular line up.  I'll say again that I'm not certain how the food is Portuguese.  That being said, it is mighty delicious.  I love the personal service.  I love the corn bread.  The starters are phenomenal, to the point where I sometimes think that the entrees are superfluous.  But when we get them, they are lovely too.  I love the ambiance.

Corkage was an extremely nominal fee which left room in the wallet for more delectable food. The service was smooth and very friendly. The atmosphere was inviting with a small European-style cafe restaurant vibe. Food was fresh and tasty according to all of my friends and was simply amazing from my perspective.  The sardines app and the Portuguese Mariscada seafood stew which I had/shared were cooked perfectly and flavorful. Chef/Owner Toni Pais's back story and his culinary skills are inspirational. He came out to eat afterwards and was very humble when he was given a round of applause. This is truly an underground spot worth finding when in the Burgh, a city that's now a hotbed for excellent food, and Cafe Zinho is one of the reasons why!",

They had the white anchovy tower special appetizer with anchovies, tomato in olive oil. This was also excellent, and reasonably creative. The calamari appetizer had plenty of calamari and was very good.  The Zinho salad was just OK, which was our single disappointment. On the plus side, it had artichokes and hearts of palm. On the downside, we could have prepared it at home easily; the olives were from a can and tasted bland.   All in all, great food minus the salad in a cozy place.   The restaurant is BYOB, but we were lucky to have bought a bottle of wine from the Wine & Spirits store off S. Highland Ave.   They do not take credit cards, but they said they had an ATM closeby.",

I had the quail, but wasn't given the appropriate utensils to eat it.  My mom loved the lamb.  And of course, the dessert was fabulous.  Since the kitchen is right now nearby, you can see the cooks making your meal or dessert.  This place only accepts cash although there's an atm nearby.

    "text": "There are restaurants that are special because of the food and there are restaurants that are special because of the service.  Cafe Zinho is EVERYTHING. The proprietor of Zinho is one of the nicest gents in the business as far as I'm concerned.  I know this because I had occasion to collaborate with him on a few events 10 years ago.  So while I may be a bit biased, 10 years in between interactions sort of negates that in my opinion.  My point is, if you're one of those people that enjoys patronizing establishments run by nice people, Zinho fits the bill.    We arrived last night for my birthday dinner at 7:30 and I immediately fell in love with the place. Nestled along the \"homey\" part of Ellsworth Avenue, Zinho exudes a relaxed luxury that might cater to customers of all types.  Our server Ramon was wonderful, and made thoughtful recommendations for each course.  I selected a roasted beet and goat cheese salad as a starter and crab cakes for my entree.  Neither disappointed. The salad was a tower of carefully combined goodness and the crab cakes were stuffed, not with filler, but succulent crab.  While I'd get the crab cakes again, next time I'm in for the lamb, since one bite of Jonathan D's dish had me hooked so hard I practically baaa'ed (poor lamb).  At $180 for four people it isn't the cheapest option in the 'Burgh, but by no means is it the most expensive. AND, it's BYOB so bring a bottle and enjoy the wonderfulness that is Cafe Zinho.",

    "text": "I had a wonderful meal and terrific evening at Cafe Zinho. Before I talk about the food, however, I want to explain why I'm giving Zinho only 4 stars. There are two major factors that negatively affected my overall experience. First, for a restaurant as expensive as Zinho (somewhere between $80-100 for two people), I think it's absurd that they don't accept credit cards. They are CASH or PERSONAL CHECK ONLY. For a place like this - with prices like these - it just comes off as cheap. Secondly, when I called to make a reservation, they encouraged me to bring a bottle of wine (it's BYOB), but did not mention the corkage fees, which will vary depending on the number of people and the number of bottles. It just seemed strange to not mention that additional charge when I called to make the reservation. True 5-star restaurants might work transaction and corkage fees into their menu prices, but I think the quality restaurant culture is beginning to move away from charging separate fees.  Those minor complaints aside, our meal at Cafe Zinho was phenomenal. I wanted something upscale and out-of-the-ordinary for our one night in Pittsburgh. We drove 10 miles from downtown - through sudden blizzard conditions - specifically for this place. Though neither of us are huge seafood aficionados, their menu is very accessible to both adventurous and more reticent eaters.   For an appetizer, we ordered the puff pastry-encased goat cheese, laid in a sweet pumpkinseed sauce. The entrees really stole the night, however. I ordered the mussels in a vodka tomato sauce laid overtop pappardelle pasta. The sauce included chopped onions and other spices worked right into it, making its consistency chunky rather than \"creamy\" - the word used by the menu description. My fiance ordered the crab cakes with the lemon-vanilla glaze. Both of us were blown away by these entrees, not to mention obsessed with their Portuguese cornbread that they bring to the table (out of this world). For dessert, the options change - but it appears they usually have a cheesecake and mousse option.    The staff was helpful, kind, and very invested in their food. The ambiance is very intimate: a small place with a seating capacity of no more than 35, original art lining the walls, and a small bar at the entrance (it's more of a server area because they don't serve alcohol on the premises). Overall, a really memorable evening, only slightly marred by those strange fees, which could be easily avoided. Just remember your checkbook and be prepared for corkage fees - if you go prepared, the only surprises will be the delicious kind offered by Cafe Zinho.",

    "text": "Today I had one of the best hamburgers I have ever had. I ordered one of the specials of the day, a filet magnon hamburger that came with Cole slaw and chick peas. This burger did not need a dam thing on it but of course keeping it real I used ketchup, LOL. OMG this is one of those burger that ALL other will be judged by. This was one of the specials of the day so if you want to try one call ahead to see if it's on the special of the day menu or request one in advance with Chef Pais. You will not be disappointed. Wife had a veggie plate that looked very tasty but I was busy with my burger. This restaurant is very eclectic and personal. It has a very nice atmosphere and they play music in the restaurant which is set at the perfect volume for dining. You will have no problems hearing both the music and your dinner company. Looks like you will not get any microwaved food here, I think all the food is prepared by stove and oven. They only take cash so stop by the ATM machine on your way or you can use the machine they have on site. You can bring your own bottle of wine and they also have outdoor seating.",

The food is very good and the atmosphere is relaxed and Bohemian.  The puff pastry appetizer is always a winner.  The chef, Tony Pais, is Portuguese, but there are a lot of elements of French cuisine in his cooking. He used to own Cafe Zao and Baum Vivant, both well regarded restaurants, but I find the food is much more reasonable at Zinho. There's a few tables outside, and I find it enjoyable to choose those tables on a warm day.",

The appetizer (tomato, mozzarella, white anchovies) was super cold, like they had made a bunch and stuck them in the fridge. My fish was done well, but I didn't love the sauce or the presentation. My husband's burger was done well too, but also just a little flat. These dishes just didn't excite me when they came to the table. Couple this with the Coca Cola glasses and the rickety chair.... we left feeling just kind of blah about the whole experience.",

Bacalhau (dried salted fish - the national dish of Portugal) was nowhere on the menu; which is just fine by me!  The restauarnt has an eclectic decor and a nice setting.  The only tough part is parking in Shadyside... but on this night, I managed to get a spot right in front of the restaurant.  For dinner, I had lobster ravioli (a special) and my date had mushroom ravioli.  Both were outstanding.   Peering around at other tables, I saw several other delectable creations that I would like to return and try.  The Peri peri chicken looked quite good.  This another of the local BYOB restauarnts, which makes me happy.  We brought a nice bottle of Pinot Noir, which always helps to make the dining experience more pleasurable.  This is an excellent find... I will be back.  Soon.",

But our food didn't live up to my expectations.   The Portuguese bread served before our meal was crusty, warm, and special -- a cross between a French loaf and cornbread. Unfortunately, things went down hill from here. The highly recommended goat cheese and phyllo dough tart was too rich and too mild, The pears didn't give enough sweetness and there wasn't any salt. So, it was just creamy. Plain and creamy.    Between us we had three entrees. The salmon was my favorite of the three. It was an interesting preparation and well done. But, nothing special. The monk fish special was too sweet for my taste and a bit tough. (I don't want to have to use a knife to cut my fish.) I appreciated the homemade pasta and delicate flavors of the ravioli, but it was just too bland. A bit of salt or spicy or something would have been nice.   I may come back to try the burger, but no more $25 disappointing entrees for me.",

    "text": "Most of the reviews we read called this place \"comfy\" or \"quaint,\" which translates into \"a very small restaurant.\" It seems that the small size of the place ensures that every meal is attentively prepared because our food came out perfectly executed.  My husband had a crab and salmon tartar appetizer, while, simply from reading reviews, I walked in knowing what I wanted: goat cheese in puff pastry swimming in a shallow dish of creamy asian pear sauce. I literally wiped every bit of sauce off my plate with their bread.  Which, speaking of bread, the Portuguese cornbread is to die for. I highly recommend buying a $2 loaf to take home and (as recommended by one of the waitresses), make yourself a few thick slices of french toast.  For dinner, my husband had duck with a Grand Marnier sauce and I had Cornish game hen in a butter wine tarragon sauce. Both were served with simply dressed cauliflower, broccoli, peppers, and red potatoes. Again, we ate every bit of food off our plates and sopped up the extra sauce with our bread.  We did happen to order the two most expensive entrees on the menu, and both had appetizers, but I think $85 is absolutely reasonable for the high caliber food we received. Bring your own bottle of wine, order the specials, and take a loaf of bread home. We're sure happy that we did!",

    "text": "Well this was unexpected!   After passing by Cafe Zinho for years and years I finally hopped into a hidden Portuguese oasis. Who knew the little hole in the wall near my old hair salon had such good food?! My friends and I had known long about it, but last night we were in need of a BYOB ($5 corkage) and found much more than that.   We started with two appetizers. (A very good tip from a fellow yelper!) One friend is majorly allergic to gluten and our fabulous waiter MORE than accommodated her questions and requests with patience. We all shared some kind of rice stuffed pepper that was moist and exploding with flavor, I forget the name...but definitely a must-have. We also were excited to try the pan-sauteed (not fried) calamari. I'm not a huge fried calamari fan, but this was swimming in olive oil and fresh herbs...it was a lovely delight away from a typically americanized version.   We also ordered the tomato bisque and the soup of the day. These were insane! The best soups I've ever had out. The soup of the day was a roasted creamy mushroom soup and I almost licked my bowl clean. The flavors were outstanding and we all couldn't decide which soup was better. Make sure to definitely soak everything up with their delicious table bread that seemed to have just come out of the oven every time they replenished our basket!   Something worth passing is yes, the salads...they're just okay. But my friends raved about their pork and I will not forget the visual of my friend picking up the bone to lick it clean while our waiter just laughed at us! :)   Best part of the story? Well, the food takes a lonnggg time to come out, (warning, but probably because it is so fresh!) after finishing our bottle, our neighboring diners also took advantage of the BYOB but seemed to have left half of theirs when they were done! So after a silly little dare, we became the table of three that snuck 3 large pours of wine and placed it back on their table! Hey! Who was going to drink it anyways?! The little portuguese owner came over and was sincerely shocked at how the wine bottle was empty...she asked, \"Did you three drink this?\" We giggled and my friend's boyfriend said, \"YES.\" She smiled, and let us have our moment.   We left a big tip. She obviously didn't mind. And it's places like this that make me miss home!",

We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.  Menu was somewhat limited, although we didn't try any starters which many of the other reviews state are the best offerings on the menu. I ordered the seafood stew and my husband had the chicken dish. The stew had seafood: clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, and some type of summer sausage, but not much else. The broth was oily. My husband's chicken was prepared adequately; however the rice it was paired with was extremely underdone while the veggies were over-cooked and mushy.   I might go back once more with a bottle of wine for appetizers only but for the price I will dine on entrees elsewhere.",

    "text": "This is the kind of restaurant that I deeply appreciate.  Family-owned.  Off the main roads.  Charming interior.  Unique staff.  WONDERFUL FOOD.  (We called this our \"less-expensive Casbah\" when we left).  Like everywhere we end up going, we go because a Yelp review we have read, that inspired us to give it a try.  We new it was BYOB, but we weren't in the mood for drinking, so we walked on over.  It was our own fault that we got there, at 5:00pm, on the dot - and they were not quite ready to be opened, as they were finishing setting up the tables.  My boyfriend and I took a quick walk around Ellsworth.  It's a family-owned business where they turned their front garage into the most charming, artsy-like, romantic restaurant.  We'll cut them some slack!  When we got back, they were ready for us; and we chose to snag a table outside (they thought we were nuts).  However, in one of the reviews, we read that they had no A/C, which was a big selling point for us (I absolutely loathe going into a freezing cold, A/C'd out restaurant, and being forced to bring a hoodie with me, when it's 90+ outside.  And we do kind of like hot, humid, and muggy); but, I guess they have upgraded because the A/C was BLASTING on the inside of the restaurant.  We started off with the Gazpacho.  This was a perfect summer starter because it was cool, extremely flavorful, and a natural air conditioner to the body.  It had lumps of shrimp and crab meat at the bottom, which made us feel like we were eating somewhere on Duval St. in Key West.  I normally don't like cilantro, but the cilantro was so subtle and completely rounded out the flavor.  When our waitress brought out the freshly baked loaf of corn bread, we sopped up the rest of it.  It is True, the wait staff genuinely appreciates your compliments and feels honored every time you say you enjoyed something.  I ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli and my boyfriend ordered the Lamb Burger.  When our dishes came out, they were the most beautiful dishes I had ever seen - full of color, wonderful portion sizing, and aromas just attacking the olfactory with sensational goodness.  My Ravs were topped with this grape tomato paquillo sauce, which tasted like it had hints of red pepper also.  It was FANTASTIC.  Plus, there were whole mushrooms, okra, carrots, and cauliflower on top of the dish as well.  I don't know what kind of separate seasonings were on the veggies, but they were to-die-for also.  I can't exactly remember how many Ravs were in my bowl, but every time I thought I was finished, there was another ravioli to be found, and then another.  For the price - I think there were a total of 10 fully-stuffed, hand-made mushroom ravs.  Incredible.  My boyfriend's Lamb Burger came with a cranberry and raisin jam (but \"jam\" seems to cliche of a word for this topping), and a salad that had slices of apples in it.  Now I'm usually not one to eat sweeter tasting foods; however, the complementing of sweet and savory in this dish blew my mind.  I'm also not a big fruit eater (unless it's blended in a smoothie), but I totally got past all that because the flavors and the textures all are playing nicely with one another.  We opted out of dessert because we were so stuffed.  But our bill for an appetizer and two filling, insanely delicious entrees came to $40.  DING DING DING DING DING!  WE HAVE FOUND A WINNER!    After dinner the owner came over to our table and we were introduced.  What a wonderful, sweet, and genuine older guy.  We will definitely be back before the menu changes again; and next time, we're going for entrees and dessert!!   One last thing - it is a Cash Only restaurant, but they do have an ATM on-site.",

The smaller seating area allows for an intimate dinner whether you're coming as a couple or bringing the whole family.

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Tuesday evening with my parents and wife for my actual birthday dinner.  Cafe Zinho has been on my list of bookmarks for years and for some reason I had never made it there.  Perhaps it's the lack of a website or the fact that they aren't open on Sunday's or Mondays.  In any case I called at about 2 PM on Tuesday asking if I could make a reservation for 7 PM that night for a party of 4.  I was told that we could and to not forget that it was BYOB.  Our party arrived shortly after 7 PM to find a completely empty restaurant.  So we were given our choice of tables and I ended up choosing us a table right near the open doors.  The inside of cafe zinho is what I would call eclectic although still tastefully decorated.  There also didn't seem to be any air conditioning which was ok since the evening wasn't too hot and we were right near the open door.  For dinner, I decided to start off by having the calamari.  It came in a soup like pot with cous cous and a curry base.  The calamari in it was quite tender and it may well have been the best cooked calamari that I have ever had.  Meanwhile the curry had a good but subtle flavor while the cous cous provided something of substance.  It was the best appetizer that I have eaten in awhile.  Then for my entree I decided to go with the Grand Marnier Duck.  The duck was cooked nicely and had a good crispy exterior.  Meanwhile the sauce had a nice orange flavor and I thought that it was tasty.  Then the accompaniments were a couple of fingerling potatoes and a few other sparse vegetables that seemed to be copied on other entrees as well.  It was here that I would have liked to see the entree improved upon.  While the duck wasn't as good as the calamari had been it still ended up being a good entree.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back to Cafe Zinho again in the future.  I absolutely loved my appetizer and the fact that it was BYOB and thought that my entree was pretty good as well.",

    "text": "This is a cozy little place. I made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening because the restaurant we were supposed to go to  closed due to an emergency. Major bummer for us, but life goes on and luckily we were able to get a table at this place. At first we were seated by the register area and that was a little awkward because it felt like the hostess and waitresses were right at the table with us. I wasn't in the mood for a large group dinner so we asked to be moved, a request they graciously accomodated. Unfortunately, we were then seated pretty close to the door and it was a cold February evening so that was a little rough. Fortunately, we had a whole bottle of wine to warm us up.  OK, so now let's talk about the wine thing:  this is the first BYOB place I've ever eaten at and I loved it! It's pretty great to share a bottle of wine that you can pick out yourself, rather than spend a fortune on some ordinary bottle offered by the restaurant. I didn't know if we had to open the bottle ourselves and brought a cork screw just in case, but turns out they open it for you; I can't remember if there was a corkage fee, but it they do it's a small fee.  Now, for the food: we shared a sardine appetizer and it was quite good. The bread was also really delicious, very fresh and soft. For my entree I ordered the lobster tail and that was very tasty! The veggies served alongside were cooked perfectly and the sauce was light and flavorful. We ended the meal with a chocolate mousse, which my partner didn't love, but I thought it was pretty good, definitely not the best I've had, but good!  To sum it all up: good food, cozy place, and friendly staff!",

I had the duck cassoulet (a special for the evening) -- which featured undercooked potatoes, broccoli, and peppers. Undercooked potatoes is a technical mistake. But, broccoli and peppers are a conceptual mistake. They have no place in a cassoulet. They aren't an exciting addition to a traditional dish. They are just unusual garnish.

    "text": "Based on the menu, I would classify Cafe Zinho as more of a general fine dining restaurant rather than a Portuguese specialty restaurant. There are some Portuguese items, but I feel the emphasis is on providing high quality dishes non-specific to any particular cuisine.  For starters, we were brought corn bread which was great. It had a great textural contrast with the flakiness of corn bread along with the fluffiness of loafs.  Next, we had frog legs in a lemon and white wine sauce. The sauce was very pleasant as it highlighted a contrast among bittery, buttery, and sweetness. We dipped many pieces of corn bread in the sauce. Most of the flavor of the frog legs came from the sauce. The frog legs themselves were very chewy. I suspect that they were prepared in an oven; I think quickly grilling or quickly deep frying the frog legs might yield a more pleasant texture.  The main entree was great! I had the filet of trout which comes with grilled vegetables. The grilled veggies were simple yet well executed. The trout was nicely seasoned and cooked. I was able to appreciate the taste of the fish as well as the light seasoning. I wish the trout's skin was a bit crispier; however, I want to emphasis the the fish was cooked very much to my liking.  All in all, the food was very good. The main entrees were quite pricey. You're likely to be spending at least $30 per person.",

Amazing flavors, never too fussy, always done to perfection! I can't forget the flaming pineapple dessert, so good. Service is excellent. I don't know why we ever go anywhere else cause this place is always a treasure!",

All staff there are very friendly and helpful. The place is quite small so maybe you should make a reservation in advance.   One of nice things about this place is BYOB ($5 per a wine bottle). If you don't bring anything. You can walk to Wine and Spirits, which is very close to the restaurant. So you can choose whatever you like to drink.  Most importantly, the food was great! We had chicken livers and octopus for appetizer. For main dishes, we had a whole fish with caper sauce, and lamb racks. The entree dishes cost from $20-$35, and $28 in average.",

I ate a bite - in front of my clients & colleagues - for good measure [and to hide my naievete], but they eventually noticed I was not eating it. I politely, humbly explained my mistake, and they respected me for trying something new. Of course my client then told me about blood tofu, which was a bit shocking, but I firmly believe in expanding one's own mind and perceptions of the world and all its cultures, so I appreciated his sharing. Adding this experience to that of eating bone marrow here at Pulpo in D.C.)",

    "text": "Wow!  We were looking forward to this for our anniversary, and we weren't disappointed!  We splurged with three starters:  grilled sardines, octopus, and pheasant terrine.  Each was lovelier than the next.  The terrine was particularly delicious, served with some sort of artisanal mustard and pickled onions on the side, and some nicely grilled bread.  The octopus was perfectly cooked, not rubbery at all, but buttery, nicely seasoned and presented.  The sardines were grill-hot with an ever so slightly charred and crispy skin, and the accompanying vegetables were barely warm, which actually made for a nice contrast.  Main courses:  I had the shellfish stew from the menu.  All of the various seafood was perfectly cooked.  The broth could have had a bit more heat for my taste, but still: lovely.  The husband had one of the specials: cassoulet with venison osso buco. Heavenly, especially on a winter evening.  Gorgeous venison shanks and dome nicely roasted vegetables.  Another splurge: dessert.  We had the chocolate terrine and the key lime creme brulee, both of which were understated and luxurious.  Not fans of big, vulgar desserts, so these were right up our alley--rich, flavorful, just a nice sweet little end to a perfect meal.  Service was especially nice and attentive, but never intrusive.  Loved the shabby chic decor and the oddly shaped dining room.  Must be lovely in the summer with doors open in this quiet corner of Shadyside.  We'll definitely return to find out!",

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant many times in the past and have typically had good food and decent service. Last night we were sorely disappointed in the food, service and venue. We reserved a party of 9 two weeks ago for a friend's birthday. When we arrived (to a virtually empty restaurant) the table they had for us was crammed against the wall and the chairs were so tight together that we couldn't move.  We asked to be moved and they refused.  Then we order food and we were told that the fish had bones. Well it was ALL bones. At $44 a plate they could have filleted the damn fish.     After a very mediocre dinner one of us (seated next to me) ordered tea.  The waitress brought the oversized tea box to the table and knocked me in the eye with it. Yes I'm sore and have a terrible headache. Luckily I still have my eye. Not only did they not offer to comp my dinner but the owner never even came over to see if I was ok. VERY BAD FORM TONY.   We will probably not be back.",

    "text": "What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time, we wanted to do a little bit of this and that.  2 appetizers, Becky s salad and the special of the eve:  smoked salmon on crostini with creme fresh, a clam dish, forgot name, with the best tomatoe-white wine, I could have drunk from the bowl, broth; Becky s salad (the lemon dressing was out of this world delicious--again, could have drunk it, good).  I m usually not fan of walnut in my salad, but the crumbled goat cheese made me forget about my dislike of it, that I ate it happily.  Good pairing.  The special of the night, we opted for sharing the lamb shank with reduced red wine sauce and simple veggies.  Small veggie selection by american standards--half russet potato, slither of zucchini, and a stem of green onion, but the star afterall was the lamb, and it was meduim perfect, just as I ordered!   \"Would you care for some dessert?\", Ramon, our waiter (he was fabulous!) asked.  And so round 3 begins.  Coffee, a chocolate mousse with whip cream, beauty and...  their version of creme brulee.  I thought it had a hint of peanut butter, but not sure.  Regardless it was  so, so divine. This place was busy but we did not feel rushed, unlike most places.  The service was great, the atmoshphere quaint; it s definitely a neighbourhood cafe-- alot of repeat clientele, from what I gathered.  We shall return. Finally, on an end note. Cafe Zinho is BYOB, so bring your favourite bottle or magnum of vino.  And they only take cash or personal check, but they do have an ATM.",

My husband and I took our 6 year old daughter there and we all had an amazing experience and delicious meal.  My husband's lamb burger melted in his mouth, my lamb chops were tender (medium rare) and juicy with just enough spices, my daughters spinach and cheese ravioli was so yummy she was practically licking her plate (insert appropriate level of parenting/manners ;~) All in all, my 'foody family' gave this 'gem of a Portuguese/Mediterranean restaurant' an ENTHUSIASTIC THUMBS UP!

Both experiences were different but amazing. The food is really good. Most recently I got a pork loin dish which was served with an amarena cherry sauce. The restaurant is BYOB and overall reasonably priced. We sampled some appetizers for the group dinner and shared a dessert - everyone enjoyed everything!   We did have one run in, I believe with a regular customer, that stopped by and told us we were being too loud. Since he was a regular I was nervous the server would come over and ask us to be more quiet. However, she actually came over to apologize and let us know we weren't doing anything wrong.  The space is a bit small so it can be a little loud when it gets full but I didn't think it was unbearable.   This place is cash only but they do have an ATM.",

    "text": "I'm gonna update this to a solid 4 after last night's visit.   I still think the whole cash only thing is silly and that they should have a better web presence, but our meal was absolutely delicious.  This time around, I went with the seafood stew.  I was trying to be a little calorie conscious, so I skipped the appetizer round (which my companions all loved).  I couldn't resist a little nibble of the warm bread though.   Yum.     That seafood stew was a winner for sure.   I was expecting it to be small, but it was really ample and filling.  Three each of large scallops, large shrimp, plump mussels, and clams swimming in a yummy tomato broth and topped with a lobster tail.   It was a beautiful and tasty dish that I would absolutely order again.  It was $38 if I remember correctly, which I didn't really mind since the dish was very good and filling.  My only note would be that it was a little awkward to eat with the shells and tails, etc.",

Our reservation was at 6:30pm. One doesn't expect to be asked to leave right after completing meal when $200 was spent by the 4 of us. As good as the food was, we will not be going back.",

    "text": "Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu, but execution was flawed through out our meal. Also, their dishes are not really Portuguese.  For appetizers, we got chicken livers and portuguese bread pudding with mushroom cream sauce. The chicken livers lacked flavor, which is unfortunate because chicken livers on their own are not very tasty. The bread pudding was pretty good though.  Entrees were, on the whole, not impressive. The lamb chops were obviously over cooked (we ordered medium rare, and the insides were almost fully cooked). The duck breast which people raved about online were tough and the sauce was too sweet. The seafood stew lacked flavor. The lamb burger was also overcooked.",

    "text": "I've lived near Cafe Zinho for the longest time and had wanted to try it. I was so glad I did! The place is BYOB so make sure to bring something to enjoy your dinner with! One thing I took issue with was that Cafe Zinho doesn't have any internet presence. While this isn't necessarily a terrible thing, it doesn't allow you to get a good idea of whats on the menu before you visit as their are lots of seasonal specials. It also doesn't allow you to get a good idea of pricing. For the record, appetizers are in the $8-$15 dollar range, entrees are approximately $18-$35, and dessert was about another $10.   As for the food, the Portugese Cornbread that came to our table was outstanding. Our table also ordered a goat cheese pastry appetizer that was fantastic. Our entrees were good but weren't as exemplary. For dessert we got a \"chocolate velvet\" with cayenne pepper and a berry sauce drizzle. It was a great finish to the meal. However, we were surprised to find, upon getting our checks that Cafe Zinho is cash or check only. They have an ATM on sight but it's something I wish I would have known beforehand.  The atmosphere was intimate and warm, the prices were reasonable, and the food was exceptional. I'd definitely recommend Cafe Zinho to others.",

I don't know if this is authentic Portuguese food I have never eaten Portuguese food but my taste buds know what they like!    I read someone's review which said \"bland\" but I personally believe that if something is of good quality and cooked right then you don't need all the extras to cover up the natural flavors of the meat and vegetables.  Especially fish and meat.  BYOB is a plus***  Great, friendly service!",

Let's add in super friendly service, and it's a wine, I mean win.   I had high hopes, especially with how much I loved the ambiance. I love tomato bisque, so I was excited to dive into that for a first course, but it was very strangely thin. When you imagine bisque, you imagine heavy cream used, but I believe it was broth based. I just wasn't digging it.   But then our starter came out, a goat cheese-stuffed puff pastry, and it was divine! Things were looking up! It was a delicious mix of cheese, plus light and airy puff pastry that we gobbled up.   Me and a friend split two main courses; the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Pumpkin Coulis and the lamb burger with fontina and caramelized onions. I love lamb and I love squash, so this was the perfect splitting combo. I was pretty bummed when the lamb burger, while good lamb, didn't give off a lot of flavor. Which was surprising considering it also had caramelized onions, which usually pack a flavorful punch. The butternut squash ravioli also didn't offer the flavors imagines. Mostly it was the sauce that seemed to fall flat with this dish.   There was a sweet ending my friends, this cute little mason jar filled with layers of fresh raspberries, cream and Portuguese cookies was an amazing finish. I only wish everything had been equally as amazing.  I still feel like I'm not done with Cafe Zinho, so hopefully the next visit will be all wines, er wins!",
