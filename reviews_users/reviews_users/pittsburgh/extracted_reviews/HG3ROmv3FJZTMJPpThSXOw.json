    "text": "I had expected a top quality dining experience and got a prepackaged meal.   Evidently, the meals are made-ahead and reheated. All I wanted was a piece of grilled salmon. This is NOT a culinary challenge, especially since they had salmon with crab stuffing on the menu, so I figured how hard is it to make the salmon without the crab? It's impossible, evidently, because the meals have been made in advance. This would be OK at a strip mall chain place, but this place is trying to be fine dining.  The decor was trying to be urban/arty but the art was oddly hung and uneven in quality, as if some actual art had been purchased but other pieces had been painted by somebody's retired aunt. Also, there is more to decorating than exposed brick. Just sayin.   Drinks were very expensive (like New York City expensive) and the pour was very light.  Waitstaff was eager but sort of giddy.   We won't be returning.",

    "text": "I  decided to give this restaurant a try after receiving a gift certificate as part of a cooking class and was less than impressed with the quality of both the food and service. To be fair: My partner and I are from a coastal region accustomed to high quality seafood and we ordered the two specials, ahi tuna and crab stuffed shrimp, in disregard of the basic seafood restaurant wisdom indicating that specials are often attempts to sell fish about to spoil and one should avoid them at all costs. These dishes, while not on the verge of spoiling, were nothing special despite the upscale price tag and left us unenthusiastic about Mr. Wholey's establishment.  The tuna was prepared \"asian style\" which meant slightly over cooked and bathed in some sort of bitter sauce reminiscent of cheap teriyaki. This was served with absolutely fantastic wasabi mashed potatoes and expertly prepared bok choy. It was hard to overlook the fact that the chef overdressed a cut of fish that demands simplicity and in the process, destroyed the delicate flavor I was attempting to purchase. My partner's dish was an improvement in that shrimp will take a chef's liberties a little kinder and featured another rendition of the great mashed potatoes I found on my plate. The crab failed to transform the shrimp, as the name indicated it would, and could have been otherwise better employed. We declined desert based on the weakness of our entrees but must say that the mashed potatoes were memorable.  The service was moderate to poor. I worked as a waiter for a couple years and consider myself sympathetic to the occupation and the skill it entails. Our server seated us next to one of the glass garage doors lining the restaurant face. This would have been fantastic had this door been open, allowing the pleasant summer evening to breeze over our table. The door was not open and thus subjected us to a greenhouse affected micro-climate in which both of us began to sweat in the direct sun despite the pleasant temperature outside. I know from experience that patrons are evenly distributed by a host/hostess to the sections assigned to each server and that our seating was not the server's fault. Yet why the server would not open the doors and take advantage of the day is either the result of a lack of skill and/or intuition or poor management. Service 101: comfort of the patron is paramount. Our server seemed to ignore this environmental negative (and the potential to turn it into a positive) despite having to shield her eyes from the sun when addressing us. She chastised our use of the gift certificate after our meal and indicated that she would use it as a favor to us but typically this would not be okay. To clarify: Luke Wholey was due as a guest instructor at a cooking class we paid for and did not show up, sending the gift certificates as a reparation. It was in no way acceptable for her to question a valid use of Mr. Wholey's self-serving consolation. I can only assume her hesitation to use the certificates was out of concern for her tip (perhaps she thought we would think the amount due after the certificate was our total in a tip calculation). Since she must have been capable of reading the clearly stated premise indicated on the certificate itself I am left to imagine that she is used to people tipping poorly and wished to avoid continuing this trend with us.  My final note concerns the bar menu. Myriad are the restaurants at which I can overlook lapses in cuisine or service so long as the bar is strong. Wholey's makes an attempt at a draft beer list with a few solid craft brews in among the tasteless masses and has several attractive bottled offerings. The cocktail menu features anticipated twists on standards but fails to indicate the presence of a genuine mixologist. The cucumber collins thoroughly proved that suspicion. This dry take on a tom collins featured fresh cucumber and utilized hendrick's, one of the finer spirits of this ilk. How one manages to f*#k up a cocktail with such a fine gin is beyond the scope of my understanding. A warm lemon soda water with cucumber is not an acceptable refreshment.  I will not return to Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille.  Pittsburgh may be too far from the sea (much less Alaska) to foster a great seafood restaurant or perhaps I just went to the wrong place. However, Wholey's failures went well beyond the plate and indicate that a systematic or managerial fault may be in play: Poor service, poor bar-tending, and poor environment compound as issues that are unlikely to be resolved any time soon.",

Luke (the owner) himself came out and was sincere and accommodating. I don't expect a perfect experience everytime i go out to eat, but if a restaurant is having a difficult evening, it is negated by the fact that the staff and the management are sincere and doing their very best. Luke was very professional as was our server. I will definitely go back, and i highly recommend this restaurant. Not only for the food (which was phenomenal), but more importantly for the outstanding service and atmosphere. Thanks for the fantastic evening guys. It was truly enjoyable.",

The food is fantastic. Freshest fish & seriously abundant portions. I'm impressed that the take out meals are just as fabulous as the dine-in ones. On our first visit, we ordered the fish sandwich for our daughter...she's not 2 yet so it was far too much food for her but it was a beautiful cod sandwich at a beyond reasonable price. Luke came to our table to see if she enjoyed it. Had I realized it was him I probably would've told him he could shrink the sandwich a bit for smaller mouths and charge more if he wanted to! It was delicious but by the time she was done, you couldn't tell she ate anything! I'd love to see some grilled fish sliders with a side of carrot chips on the menu for the little ones. The lobster salad sandwiches (lobster rolls) are PERFECT. They seem to be made with simple ingredients but the taste and presentation are spot on! They are picturesque lobster rolls! We have had both versions and prefer the cold salad sandwich. The lobster bisque is very good but almost more of a lobster chowder. I always expect bisque to be a velvety buttery soup. That's probably my idea of what it should be rather than textbook bisque. Theirs is delicious, but has large chunks of lobster in it...whose complaining, right? The ambiance inside the restaurant is casual and fun, very appropriate for the location and style but we were still surprised and impressed when our plates arrived. All entrees far exceeded our expectations especially given the casual atmosphere. We'll be back today...it's Friday!",

I asked him to have the bisque on the side since we usually share and I love the bisque by itself.  I also thought it would be great dipping sauce but I like to decide how much I want on things.  Wow I am glad I did.  The big cup of bisque was great for dipping and the cheesy garlic fries were crispy and good. Lots of Lobster pieces strewn throughout.  I also had the trio with nice scallop and shrimp and piece of fish.  Everything fresh and good.  The infused vodkas are a real draw with bartender Joby coming up with some great concoctions to tempt you to have one more.  Luke was ever present with his great smile and welcoming attitude.

    "text": "First impression was great. The owner was standing at the door to greet us and shake our hands; very friendly. Unfortunately, it went downhill from there. We (my fiancee and I)  had a reservation. They acted as though they were aware of it, but it didn't seem like they had actually reserved anything for us.  After a few awkward moments determining where to put us we were sat but not given any menus; apparently all the menus were out even though the house wasn't full. We were given water and bread but no appetizer plates to eat from. After a longer than usual wait we were asked what we wanted to drink. There is no drink menu and when I ask about cocktails there were no specialty drinks- a long island was suggested. Then, there was a lot of waiting. Finally the two of us got ONE menu. Fiancee ordered oysters, waitress had to go ask about them, and she was not very knowledgeable of the menu. Oysters could have been cleaned better as there were pieces of shell. We were tolerating slow and substandard service because we'd heard such good things about the food.  I ordered the broiled cod which was supposed to be in a lobster cream sauce but tasted more like over-seasoned packaged brown gravy and absolutely drowned the fish. What I could taste of the fish and lump crab topping was good, but that sauce pretty much killed it. The mashed potatoes and asparagus side were very good, though.  My fiancee had the land and sea. They didn't give him a steak knife, but luckily the steak was tender enough that his butter knife cut it (he also had to ask for a fork). He was satisfied with the taste of his meal, but felt the portion was small. We had the vanilla cheesecake for dessert and that, was delicious. Waitress never came back and asked if she could get us anything else, she just just brought the check then gave us attitude when we told her we had a groupon because she had to redo the check.   We were excited about trying this place, but we were ultimately disappointed.",

The restaurant has a nice open air about it and the decor is nautical with bright wall murals and tables made of large spools. The menu has something for everyone. We all enjoyed the food and the hospitality. I was impressed how the waiter continually checked on us before and during the meal. I wasn't feeling particularly well that evening, and saw a kids grilled cheese on the menu. I certainly didn't want to impose, but asked the waiter if I could order it! I expected him to say no, but he enthusiastically said, \"of course\". It was delicious and helped settle my queasy stomach. Everyone else in my party loved their sushi, salads and fish dishes. We will definitely come again.  A great place to bring a larger party. Good food, nice staff and considerate service. The only thing I would suggest was a little more light. When it got dim outside and they turned down the lights it is difficult to see. A candle or small lights above the tables would increase the ambiance of the restaurant.

We started with amazing appetizers and a great server named Davin (sorry if it's spelled wrong). I ordered the calamari and a drink named Paloma. Others at the table got mozzarella sticks, crab cakes, and lobster bisque fries. They were all delicious. Then the Baja shrimp volcano came recommended by the manager named Ryan.  The food lived up to it's hype. We all enjoyed our food. Since it was my birthday I received a complimentary cheesecake. It was delicious. I thank you to the workers who did a phenomenal job caring for me and my friends.  *Reason for 3 stars*  Upon leaving the establishment we were greeted by Mr. Robert Wholey. There were racial comments said that made me and my company feel very uncomfortable.  It's a shame good food went to waste. I will not recommend anyone to go here if these are the ideals that are upheld.",

What appears to be \"worth it\"   - Happy hour drink specials - $5 house wines and 1/2 priced cocktails were a sure winner - The sushi options looked great and the prices weren't too out of line.   - Some of the starters.    What wasn't \"worth it\" - The entrees - priced at $26-$36 on average, the few I tried didn't really blow me away.  It looks like a lot of food, but it's really just normal portions of fish and veg, with a double portion of starch.    - The specials - order with caution! - prices are not disclosed in the descriptions, so I accidentally ordered $30 worth of King Crab legs (1/2 lb that was described as an appetizer portion) along with a $32 entree (stuffed shrimp that I wouldn't have knowingly paid that much for).      Overall, I'd go back, but with more of an eye toward ordering stuff in the \"worth it\" category.",

I ordered the appetizer combo which is a baby octopus salad, squid salad and seaweed salad. The baby octopus and squid salad were relatable to a nicer Chinese buffet; while edible, not at all what you'd expect from a restaurant specializing in seafood. When ordering, I asked if the seafood was fresh. She confirmed it was and when we inquired about the Wholey name she said they were not affliliated but their seafood was fresher than the market. The first time I mentioned the overly chewy seafood, the waitress simply said she doesn't eat anything like that so she doesn't know what it should taste like. The 2nd time I mentioned, she didn't react at all.   My boyfriend had a softshell crab sandwich and it was good. That's why they get 3 stars.",

He went out of his way to make sure we were happy!   The food was WOW! We came for the lunch menu, so it was very reasonably priced (im not sure what dinner is like). Obviously you have to come with a taste for seafood, but they have an incredible selection of sandwiches, entrees, apps, and sushi. My group for the ahi tuna sandwich, lobster roll, and shrimp po boy and we all left completely satisfied but not over stuffed which was perfect!   Absolutely recommend this place if your looking for something perfect to eat in the strip.",

    "text": "I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the delicious oysters we had last night (Tuesday's are still half price so you get 12/$15).    I really, really want to like this place...  I love the concept, I love the fact that the original & still flourishing Wholeys is right down the street, I LOVE the fact that on every occasion that we have been there- Luke was greeting guests...  BUT their service (at least the regular bartender service) is quite slow and very inattentive.  There are about 20 seats at the bar and there were maybe 6 people sitting there when we sat down.  It took the 'cooler' of the 2 bartenders over 5 minutes to step over to ask us, \"You wanna see menu's...?\"  Like, how about \"Can I get you guys a drink while you check out the menu...?\"  After-all, we WERE sitting at the bar.  We sat down at 6:30 and happy hour was going on till 7.  We were handed menu's and he walked away.  We weren't told of the HH specials until we asked the 'friendlier' bartender.  The oysters aren't even listed on the menu- I could understand if they were listed w/o pricing or with a caveat that said \"These are some of the types we offer, depending on the season and the fisherman's 'haul...\"    The service finally improved when the 'bar manager' stepped behind the bar and started serving the full bar.  I don't know what the other 2 guys did while he was serving but they almost blended into the background.  The manager was very friendly & knowledgeable, making suggestions when people asked about beers & wines...  I just don't know if those other 2 were pulled from being servers and told they had to tend bar for the night or what, but they just seemed like they were uninterested in being there...   As for the oysters- we had originally ordered the Blue Points but after waiting about a half hour- the bartender came over to tell us that they were out of Blue Points and he suggested we substitute the St. James River oysters.  They arrived about 5 minutes later- complete with a cocktail sauce & horseradish.  They were delicious...!    The owners- Mr Robert Wholey is about the friendliest guy you're going to meet.  He stopped to talk, told us a little about the restaurant, invited us up to see his art gallery (which we declined ONLY because we were afraid we'd lose our seats at the bar).  He stopped at every table- he would be a favorite of Jon Taffer's (from Bar Rescue).  And his son- Luke... he's also as friendly as his dad and he stopped to talk about the restaurant, his favorite muskie fishing baits & areas, etc.  These guys are a class act and that's why I love this place...",

They should pick one and stick with it. Nothing was really terrible but the large warehouse atmosphere leaves a bit to be desired as it's pretty noisy and then the music added to the noise",

    "text": "YUMMY FRESH SEAFOOD!!!! That equals a happy experience in my book. The oysters at Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille in the Strip are total perfection. Slurp one of those and you are instantly transported mentally to the beach. We ate so many of them at a recent Yelp event that we nearly shamed ourselves. As a result, we couldn't wait to return for dinner and we didn't wait long to make that happen.   My hubby and I order a calamari starter pretty much everywhere we go. We're obsessed and we make no apologies! No apologies needed for the calamari here! Super fresh, lightly breaded and cooked to tender, mouth watering delight. The basil marinara it was served with was a bit bland, however. Punch up the dipping sauce and its a home run.  Being the seafood haven that they are, they also serve sushi. I ordered the charred tuna and it was every bit as fresh and delish as I'd hoped.  For dinner my husband ordered the soft shell crab special and he raved. I also have a crab addiction, just not for soft shells. I took a bite of his and as soft shells go, they were good - just not my thing. He just kept making happy, crunchy food noises next to me.  More to my liking was the Broiled Atlantic cod topped with colossal lump blue crab served with lobster cream sauce. It came with a side of grilled asparagus and I opted out of the potatoes in favor of their roasted root veggies as my 2nd side. The lump crab in that sauce had me making those happy noises every time I took a bite and there were lots of hearty bites to be had & I even shared with my boy. I'm sure it was intended to be a complete bite with the cod, I just couldn't make myself do that. The cod was really good and very fresh but for me the crab took the starring role.  The portion was big enough for me to take home lunch for the next day - minus the crab that I'd inhaled.  I could have had a whole plate of just that lump crab and probably would have upped to 5 stars. Can this be added to the menu??? Actually anytime a lump crab entree is on any menu, I order it.  We walked by on a recent Saturday and saw this restaurant was bumping at lunchtime, which I was super happy to see. Luke's is a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene and I'd love to see this restaurant do really well. I can only imagine what is yet to come here and I'm excited for it!",

I ordered the seared ahi tuna appetizer, props to this being mostly discounted due to the yelp checkin but the tuna was overcooked and personally I think the dish would be much better leaving the tuna raw because the flavor of the slaw and sauce was a good compliment.  My crab cake sandwich was small and I was disappointed that they would not broil the crab cake but the waiter assured me that it was only quickly flash fried. We might have differing definitions of flash fried because there was a thick layer of fried crust which deterred what would have otherwise been a good sammy. The fries were excellent - well seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The bloody marys (although I didn't order one) had epicly sized accoutrements.",

Everything came out great and tasty, except the mussels, while it tasted delicious, there were multiple dead and stinky ones.  A older gentleman walked around and talked to customers, and he asked how everything was and I told him. He said it would be taken off, however the manager (different person) took off 50% for the dish after we told the waiter that brought our check at full price. Now I don't care about the $7.50, but it's more about customer service. I've managed restaurants also, and I wouldn't ever refund for a dish if there was no problem and it's just the customer being difficult, but the mussels were dead and there's practically nothing inside, except for the lining of the mussel. Don't tell me you'd refund me for the dish that you made with dead mussels and then not do it. It's a matter of principle, the money is not an issue.  This is the first time visiting Pittsburgh, and I heard good things about this place. Food was good, customer service, not that great. And customer service/experience is a big part of my dining experience. Waiter was good though.",

First of all, the chicken tenders are made from real chicken (not like those freezer tenders or nuggets) and the batter was just the right amount. I had the mahi-mahi tacos and it had just the right amount of heat to it. My husband had the fish & chips. There were 3 good-size portions and there was definitely more fish than batter. My husband, who is normally a big eater, could not even finish even after I helped eat 1 of the fish portions. The batter is not the deep-fried batter and it was delicious. The restaurant makes their own sauce and this definitely even added points. I had the mahi-mahi tacos which on the menu it said you only get 2. I expected the portion to be tiny since they are appetizers but the portions were enough for it to be a meal for me. Finally, we had the pumpkin cheesecake which even with 4 people was a big portion to share. We had to take 1/2 of it home, along with the fish & chips. The icing on the cake for us was Angie, our server. She is the best server I have ever had. She was very attentive, always refilling our drinks (soda only) without us asking. We would be halfway through our drinks and in she comes with our next round, and even filling to-go cups for us. She was very friendly, and for her alone this review is more than 5 stars!",

When we got our drinks ...we took a sip of our drinks. .. looked at each other & knew we couldn't drink these drinks. .. just awful tasting. Can't even tell you what was wrong because they tasted just rotten. Ordered an appetizer & asked if we could have new drinks. .. wine instead as we figured that'd be safer. Server was quick to say sure & scampered off to the bar. .. we then watched as our server mocked us to the bartender ... we know this because we could SEE her & could hear it. Lucky for us no spit. Lol. Comes back, we have our wine.  Appetizer came shortly afterwards. The food was great. I love peel ' n eat shrimp, these were fabulous.  All in all food good, customer service shitty. I'll give it another try as I hope for a better experience. ...if not better on round 2, you'll hear about it.",

    "text": "Definitely a solid choice for seafood in Pittsburgh. The lobster bisque fries are absolutely amazing. I can eat them for breakfast lunch and dinner seven days a week. Sushi is very tasty as the fish is very fresh. I haven't had anything on the menu that absolutely blows me away but I haven't had anything bad. The sushi is always a safe bet that any of the specials are phenomenal. The lobster rolls probably one of my favorite things. The bar is cool. Some of the drinks they make her a little too sugary for my taste. But if that's your thing then you're in luck. Have a decent beer selection nothing to write home about. All in all very solid choice for seafood in the strip District.",

Brett behind the bar hooked us up with a deliciously mixed Bloody Mary with all the fixins, including two seasoned shrimp and a DELICIOUS soft shell crab to boot! it was amazing! flavor on the shrimp was a bit lack luster, but the lemon and seasonings used on the crab were on point! Brett was informative and entertaining and the ambiance was inviting. didn't have any other food, as this Bloody was a meal in itself, but would easily return!",

There's not many places in the 'Burgh to get great oysters, but definitely Luke Wholey's is one of them. Especially check out their happy hour when they have 1/2 price specials! I consistently have had great fish here - fresh, delicious and everything cooked perfectly. The lobster bisque and the old bay peel and eat shrimp are my favorite starters other than oysters. I've also had salmon and tuna here that was excellent!",

Being from the west coast we don't usually trust seafood places that aren't on the ocean. This place was great. The fish and chips were good and a single serving is enough for two. My wife had the Sockeye Salmon and was more than pleased. I was totally blown away by the seared Ahi, perhaps the best I've ever had.   And the service was good, quick and fun!  Almost enough of a reason to move to Pittsburgh.",

Second, most of what they serve  is deep fried to the point where the place fills up with this blue haze. It really makes your clothing wreak afterward. Lastly, it's the strip not Manhattan... way over priced for just \"ok\" food. There is much better and shame on me for not checking out the area first.",

They were serving 3 different kinds of oysters, and I got one of each.  A variety from Canada called Raspberry Point was expecially tasty.  For my meal, I got the sockeye salmon with crab meat.  Superb.  I appreciated the quality of fish.  Others at the table ordered the lobster fries and the tuna entree.  The only negative I heard was that the tuna portions could have been bigger.    I usually don't give 5 stars, but I tried to think of something that could have made the meal better, and I couldn't come up with anything.  So 5 stars it is!!",

    "text": "Valentines day is supposed to be a pleasent memory. This one was not, courtesy of Luke Wholeys.    After arriving early for a reservation, we placed an order at the bar for old bay peel and eat shrimp. 5 mins after placing that order we were ushered to our table. The bar staff assured me that the shrimp would be sent to the tableside. It took them another 45 mins to present half a dozen peel and eat shrimp and no old bay seasoning. Cocktail sauce tasted more of horseradish rather than a traditional sauce.   Lobster bisque fries: arrived 20 mins ahead of the peel and eat shrimp and  whilst visually appealing, it left much to be desired. Lobster meat was rubbery and overcooked, almost artificial in taste. Fries were limp and soaked in grease as well as the bisque. Bisque had an overpowering sherry taste to it. Almost drowning any other flavor profile.    Main course, had hoped that it would have rebounded the already dismal experience so far, but was as inadequate as the rest of the meal. Baja blackened shrimp and scallops with a jasmine rice bed and four grilled asparagus. Rice was covered in a sweet balsamic reduction that tasted more soy sauce then balsamic vinegar reduction. Shrimp and scallops were overcooked and had the feel of rubber bouncing balls.       It will be a very long time before i ever decide to return, if at all",

    "text": "Apologies in advance for the length of this review. A group of 3 of us came here for dinner around 8:30 this past Saturday night. It wasn't crowded at all, maybe 30% full. And we all agreed this was one of the worst dining experiences any of us had ever had. I ordered the lobster bisque and shrimp tempura roll. My girlfriend ordered the jumbo lump crab roll and Cap'n Crunch roll, and her sister ordered the lobster bisque and Cap'n Crunch roll as well. We got the bisques and the crab roll relatively quickly. The bisques were okay, which is the only reason I'm justifying the single star in this review to myself instead of zero (I know one's the lowest you can go; I just wish there was a zero stars option). The jumbo lump crab was completely bland and the rice was way too warm for any sushi roll.  Then the fun really began. 20-25 minutes passed from our first items being brought out, and no sign of the rest of our orders. Barely any sign of our waitress. She only stopped by to say after about 20 minutes that our rolls would be coming soon, as a big sushi order was in the queue ahead of us. We asked for more bread while we waited. Another 10-15 minutes passed. We finally saw her again, and she explained that the sushi chef had recently been fired and that it was the new sushi chef's first night. She told us she would bring us our bread (no, it still hadn't arrived, despite it having zero to do with sushi).  We were understandably pissed at this point, and then finally our rolls arrived several minutes later. They were way too warm, the sauces didn't taste right together, and they just generally weren't good or even mediocre.  Couldn't get through more than a couple pieces each. Oh, and still no more bread. At this point, we were done. Tossed a $20 on the table and walked out. Will probably never be going back there when back in Pittsburgh.  For the record, we were not the only group who did something like this there that night. There was a couple at a table near us who abruptly left after we'd been there about 20 minutes, and were already there when we arrived. About 15 minutes after they left, a waitress came by our table with a big plate of mussels and garlic bread; when we told her we didn't order that, she swore and put it down on the table that couple had been sitting at. They had apparently gotten fed up with waiting as well.   Maybe this was just a particularly bad night for the staff there, but they made almost no attempt to communicate what was happening until we'd been waiting a long time and had been unable to flag anyone down. Oh yeah, and we never got the second helping of bread we requested, which we only did because we were starving. We will not be wasting our time or money here again.",

Atmosphere/Decor: Fun and funky vibe. A bit loud, def not the place for an intimate dinner. Loved the murals and the decor.   Food/Drink: I love hot tea and was pleasantly surprised by the tea selection. There was a speciality beverage menu but we didn't partake. There are two dinner menus; one sushi and one house. We started with the lobster bisque fries.  They were great. The bisque was well balanced, the fries fresh and large chunks of lobster. I had the seafood trio which disappointed. The fish was overcooked as was the lobster.  Instead of bok choy I received kale. My husband had the land and sea, again dissappointed. His scallop was under cooked. The steak was cooked perfectly. My son had the crab legs. The sectioning though convenient made them become cold very quickly. The mashed potatoes were a hard rock while the asparagus was perfectly grilled. For dessert we split the flourless chocolate cake which was perfect. It was rich and dense but melted quickly.",

It's nice because you can build it however you want so you don't have to get certain toppings if you don't want them. Their standard Bloody Mary is $11 and then +$2 for shrimp and +$11 for soft shell crab. Then you can add different spice levels for +$1. I chose the medium spice level which was a perfect spicy taste but didn't give me a burning cough. These bloody Mary's are awesome and the add one are well worth it!",

The atmosphere was more far casual than I expected for a quality seafood restaurant, but there was a good mix of people young and old and it felt lively. The service was friendly and prompt.   Our appetizers were the ceviche and lobster bisque. The bisque was creamy with good flavor, while the ceviche was absolutely outstanding - colorful, fresh, and tangy. Our entrees were the filet mignon oscar and the crab gnocchi. The steak was a tender and flavorful and my girlfriend raved about her gnocchi. The deserts were another highlight. The vanilla cheesecake was what you would expect, but the flourless chocolate torte was a dream of creamy, molten fudge.   The regular menu can be pricey and parking in the Strip is never enjoyable, but I highly recommend Luke Wholey's for it's superior product.",

Had to go and request the move. EVERYONE HAD TO. CRAWL THRU THE  DINING ROOM AS NO SPACEs BETWEEN TABLES. Long wait  for food. Then food runners brought one of our party a meal actually intended for one of the party of two next to us. (ordered the same item) so he ate while  the rest of us waited another 15 minutes. The guy at the next table also waited while his wife ate. How can you not know the difference between a table of six and a table of two? The waiter later admitted to us what had happened. I ordered grilled fish tacos and speciifcally spoke to waiter about not blackened spices. It arrived blackened. Waiter was good refilling the drinks but never checked with us about our meals. I have never in my life been in such a loud restaurant. DO SOMETHING ABOUT THE NOISE LEVEL. With tip meals for six, $300.",

Unfortunately, the shrimp were way over done. The worst part was the service. Our waiter was pleasant, but I waited about 20 minutes for a Pepsi, and we waited nearly 45 minutes for the sushi. We waited another 20-30 min for our dinner. He never apologized once. Even though the food is decent, it's not worth the terrible service.",

I'll say this, it was no cheap affair, three people each getting meals and drinks landed just under $100, but it was absolutely worth it. Service was also great, despite it being a rather busy day.  I had the blackened ahi tuna sandwich and a Bloody Mary. The Bloody Mary was one of the best I've ever had, with a pickle and shrimp to boot, and the tuna was cooked perfectly.  That atmosphere and location are ideal, and the food and drink this time around we're very impressive. The only negative I have is based on pricing, $10+ for a Bloody Mary is excessive, and the seafood and sushi is definitely priced at the premium.   If you're willing to make an investment for a great meal, I highly, highly recommend.",

Located in the Strip district, visitors and locals walk the streets to grab a bite and drink til their hearts desire. We decided to take some friends here this time during Memorial Weekend and it was crowded. I did see one empty table up front and quickly claimed that spot and told the hostess. However, she said that the wait time would be 30-45 minutes. Say what? I ain't got time for that. It's a good thing we got a bite to eat before having our second breakfast. I told the hostess that we were only there for drinks and we would be ordering quickly. She obliged. Yippie! We quickly got seated and ordered right away!  Robert Wholey was walking by and stopped at our table to greet us. He was in civs so I didn't recognize him with his coat and hat but proudly stated that this was his son's place and that we needed to sit here as long as we liked because they need good looking people in the forefront. LOL I died... What a friendly man and yet he has a heart of gold!  Anyways, because it's not in season we weren't able to order the softshell crab with our drinks. But we enjoyed the tomato-y peppery taste of our bloody mary's with candied bacon, a large stalk of celery, and chilled shrimps. It was delicious. (mine virgin of course) It was worth it! I'm buzzed off my baby so it is all good! My friends really enjoyed themselves.  Other things that I have tried in the past were the lobster rolls (a must) and the key lime pie (better than the south! don't tell anyone i said that) and some other stuff. Overall, this place is a great place to hangout for brunch, grab a drink, and enjoy the day with your friends.",

This year I called Oliver's & Luke's and there was no comparison- Luke was much more flexible and had better offerings for food so I scheduled our party at his restaurant.  I'm so happy I did!  It was outstanding and I received so many compliments from my work crew!  We had just under 30 people total at the party.  We had the party upstairs in the restaurant in the bear lounge and the bar upstairs.    There was quite the spread of appetizers across the upstairs bar including salad station, catfish bites, crab dip with flat bread, veggies, oysters (we didn't even discuss oysters-Luke just gave them to us), chicken skewers, and any drinks we wanted...those catfish bites and that crab dip were so good!!!  Dinner was shrimp scampi, salmon, cod, mashed pots, and we even received 3 cheesecakes!!!  The food, the service, the atmosphere, the flexibility and friendly service of Luke & Jason (the manager) all receive A plus grades and this is easily one of a few top restaurants in town.  I love this place!!!  Highly recommended for parties upstairs.",

Jayme, the Bar Manager, was very pleasant and gave us good recommendations.  Will definitely go back, even if the Nats aren't in town.",

They have great drinks, really nice bartenders and super fresh seafood. Everyone is friendly and they provide a personalized experience. Oysters are expensive but you are paying for quality. They aren't orange and fishy like Roland's. They are huge!!! I normally come here just for the oysters. Also have a Bloody Mary, they are so creative with the flavors and the appearance.",

I was worried it would be too crowded, but I think the small intimate space encouraged more mingling among the diverse group.  The appetizers were delicious - everyone commented about how good they were.  Jason and Luke did a great job helping me decide on the menu - peel to eat shrimp, chicken skewers, beef sliders, salad and scrumptious crab dip with homemade chips.  The servers, David and Angie, were efficient, quick and polite - again, got many compliments from the group about their service.  The only slight negative was the warm temp upstairs.  I realize it is very difficult to control the temp in that type of building, and they did a good job of cooling it down - my 88 year old mother loved it!  I've been to Luke Wholey's for dinner, drinks, lunch and now the party.  I plan to be back soon!",

I'm not sure what happened between then and my last visit yesterday, but it definitely wasn't the same. Maybe they have a new chef?   I ordered the same dish, craving that flavor I had last year. But I was sadly disappointed once I received my plate. The asparagus was limp and looked like it has been sitting out for a while. The overall flavor was definitely not as good either. A couple of the shrimp also tasted fishy (ie not fresh). Ironic when their seafood comes from Wholeys SEAFOOD market. :(  It wasn't horrible, but definitely not a great meal. Add to that, there were only 2 servers in the entire dining room, which was almost full. They were busting their butts, but needless to say service was very slow. It took us a good 15 minutes to get drinks. Not the fault of the servers at all though.    I left very unimpressed and probably won't go back.",

We always loved this place.. so we are out for Saint Patrick's day... which I get it, is crazy.. but we go in and 2 female bartenders who seemed very pleasant come over and greet us, we order drinks and proceed to tell them that the last bar was not clean at all and how we just were happy to be in there now.. she literally walks away, comes back and says \"every time I come down here you are talking s###!\" I look snd say excuse me, we are not talking about you or this place. She tells us to get out and takes our drinks! Omg, I'm almost 40 years old, we traveled all over the world and love good food and drinks and I have NEVER in my life had someone treat someone so rude! Like I can't even wrap my head around what happened. We have a family member that owns a very successful and large Italian restaurant, catering and banquets.. a brother that owns a bbq and restaurant.. and we help them out a good bit and I could never imagine speaking to someone the way she did. It's fine, cause we spend a lot of money and will never step foot there again. Sorry sister, there's too many great places and people in Pittsburgh that there's no need to ever step foot in there again. I rather deal with bad service and have a nice person. She was plain as day a very mean soul. Very very sad. I really hope that she gets fired, cause I feel bad that that's what is representing them.",

Today was that day. Mumsie picked me up from work for a mid-week treat at Luke's and we were not disappointed. I enjoyed the lunch entree version of [Blackened] Shrimp & Scallops on a house salad (option for jasmine rice and vegetables and sweet soy instead of blackened), while she had the Seared Ahi Tuna, also on a house salad. The salads themselves were delicious, if a bit small, and the Blackened flavor was strong, but savory.  We opted to sit in the \"window\" of the garage door opening - a poor choice for an August day that ended up topping out at 65  instead of the usually 80+!  But we still had a delightful time and I'll be returning again soon.  Bring on the Bass!",

It cost $100 for 2 dinners but so worth it. They cut the crab so the meat basically falls out on it's own. They were insane. So sweet so meaty. Red skin smashed potatoes and charred asparagus were the sides served the crab. Everything was delicious! We also enjoyed the mini crab cake appetizer, complimentary, thanks to checking in on Yelp :) The staff was friendly and knowledgable on the menu. We also had the pleasure of meeting Mr. Wholey, he came to our table and introduced himself. They have a nice selection of craft beers.

Parking was easy, finding a spot on the street after 6pm (went on a Tuesday).    Upon entering, we were told we could choose our table, so we went bar-side, near the sushi station.  We were quickly greeted by a waiter who took our drink order while giving us the daily special rundown.  Very pleasant interaction.  Another waitress delivered our drinks and explained they'd both be taking care of us tonight...both were just spot on, attentive and very fun.  I'll get to the good stuff---- the food is amazing.  I opted for the dozen steamed shrimp as an app...being from Baltimore originally, these were perfect.  Great flavor and pretty large.  My coworker opted for calimari...was lightly battered and tasty.  For the entree, I opted for the mexican volcano and kinda licked my plate (don't judge me).  The shrimp were huge, had a nice little (very little) char to them and went so well with the lobster bisque and taters.  And the asparagus was so good too.  Just a great meal.  She went with a couple of sushi rolls and raved about the freshness, quality and flavor.  We did not leave room for dessert, which I was bummed about.  Run to this place...great service, very clean decor and a really fun atmosphere.  Top notch all the way around.",

Instead of the lobster sitting in basic mayo with some cole slaw on a hot dog roll...this takes huge lobster pieces sauteed in butter and sits them on a hoagie roll - and, hold on, covers this with a generous ladle of lobster bisque.  Ok, sounds like a mistake - but oh my lord.  I wasn't that hungry at the time but I ate every last bit using that roll to soak up every last bit of bisque.  Homemade fries also helped to soak up that bisque.  So so good!",

    "text": "After hearing amazing things about Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille for years, I finally found myself making the trip on over here to see what the fuss was all about.  Initially I have to admit I wasn't super impressed. At first glance I thought the decor here was pretty standard cutesy seafood place decor - silly paintings, fish paintings everywhere and on everything, a real fish tank, that sort of thing. It just didn't do much to set the grille apart from other seafood places. And I honestly didn't feel comfortable here during the first twenty minutes or so. The outdoor tables my dining companion and I sat at didn't have anything to offer cover from the hot sun; the indoor table we moved too was a rolling table that we were afraid to bump into for fear of spilling food and drink everywhere during our meal; and since I'd walked over from work the fact that we didn't get any water at our table until after we'd ordered meant that I was admittedly feeling parched and a little cranky while I waited. (In fairness, I'm not sure if our swapping tables and moving from outside to inside seating contributed to this delay in getting said water.)  So at that point I wasn't really feeling great about this place and didn't understand what the fuss was all about, especially since while reviewing my dinner options I was disappointed to discover that there were no specials, so the menu seemed pretty standard by seafood place standards. Plus the alcoholic drinks we sipped on were pretty so-so, so I honestly started thinking, 'Why do people love this place so much?'  Then the food arrived. Oh man. First the thickest, tastiest bowl of lobster bisque I've ever had was set before me. Then after that my ahi tuna appetizer came, and I was super surprised to find that it was delivered on a bed of greens. The menu presented it as fish only, but I wasn't complaining since that made my dinner more like soup and salad rather than plain old appetizer and soup. Plus, it was really, REALLY good! The tuna was seasoned as perfectly as the soup and both were made from some of the freshest ingredients that you can find in the city. My friend absolutely loved their scallops and shrimp, which I had a chance to try - and surprise surprise, I loved them, too.  And since I hadn't ordered a ton of food for my actual meal, I had room for dessert - which was the most fantastic piece of vanilla cheesecake I have ever had. Vanilla bean cheesecake + whipped cream + Bourbon syrup = a  True piece of heaven! I would come back just for a taste of that cheesecake again, for sure.  My final thoughts: as uncomfortable as I was before the food arrived, the food made me understand exactly what everyone's raving had been about when it comes to this place. If you're a seafood fan at all, a meal here is must. I honestly can't wait for the next time I get to eat here now!",

    "text": "The reason I give this place 5 stars is because of the service. I've always been leery about ordering water as some places require you spend money. I went in solely to catch some march madness and, when I was served water I offered two dollars and the server told me not to worry about it. He was very cool and civil with me. So I then asked for a menu and ordered oysters. He explained the two types, east coast and west coast stating the latter were creamier and more expensive. I ordered east coast and he put one west coast on there for free. I believe his name was Luke. Anyway, he was a very cool and down to earth guy and really made me want to spend my money there. Oh and the oysters were very good.   I've been to this establishment before for various events associated with Global Pittsburgh. It's particularly nice summer time as it is open to the outside and in general is a good place for larger groups to gather and mingle.   In regards to my most recent visit, the friendliness of the service and how the aforementioned staff member made an effort to accommodate me and make me feel welcome fully warrants this rating and as a result, I can see myself returning and providing them business in the near future.",

While the decor is a little like a comic book meets crab shack, the menu, food, and drinks are definitely worth the trip.   Starting off with or server: she was super friendly, helpful, and came at the exact moment we needed her. Starting of with drinks and the fried calamari, my gin cocktail was strong. Boyfriend got a Moscow Mule but follower our servers tip to add blackberry liqeur to it. Definitely was tasty and different. I got crab stuffed salmon which was cooked perfectly. The sauce was on the sweeter side, but I loved the mustard and ginger components.  My boyfriend got the BaJa Volcano with shrimp.   Mashed potatoes with lobster bisque poured over, then giant shrimp and grilled asparagus forming a 'volcano' shape. Not only did it look crazy, the shrimp were blackened and the potatoes were amazing.   It wasn't busy the night we went, but it still had a good crowd. The manager, Ryan, stopped by to make sure our meals and service were good.  Very friendly staff and a great place to grab some good seafood.    A good date night place. Next time I'll have to try the sushi or oysters.",

Service was slow (this was 8-10pm on a Saturday). The air was smoky (not cigarette, but grill) - poor ventilation. Expect $30 or more per person.  I tried the crab dip with tortilla chips - a new experimental dish not yet on the menu, given to us by the owner, Luke. This was certainly nice of him. But I found the tortilla chips, though just cooked, tasted stale. Perhaps the dough was old?  The crab-stuffed salmon was good but not great. The potatoes had a sweet sauce on them that I disliked. The bok choi was fine.  For better fish dishes at the same price, try Casbah. Or if you want to stay in the Strip, try Kaya - the food is better.",

I was expecting a lot more from a place that I had heard so much about. It wasn't too busy in the restaurant, but the service seemed a bit overwhelmed. My appetizer (crab roll) came out after my entree (crab tacos) and I was already about halfway through my tacos when it came out, so I ended up taking it home for dinner. That being said, the spicy crab roll was probably my favorite part of the meal - the sushi seemed fresh and it was very flavorful. The tacos were a bit mediocre. The tempura-battered crab carried the dish, as nothing else really had any flavor. It definitely could have used a little sauce or seasoning, and it was incredibly difficult to pick up and eat since each taco just had a giant hunk of crab. We then waited quite a while just twiddling our thumbs for our desserts. The mango cheesecake was delicious and plated beautifully, but again - nothing to rave about. My other friends got the bread pudding and the chocolate cake and weren't impressed by either. All in all, not terrible for $20. However, not one of my favorite places to eat.",

Almost all of their menu sounds delicious. But like a drug, I can't seem to stay away from the Steel City Lobster Roll (Chunks of cold water lobster meat, sauteed in garlic butter, served on a bun with fresh cut seasoned fries, smothered with house made lobster bisque and creme fraiche).   But unlike other seafood places, Wholey's does NOT skimp on the meat...large pieces of whole lobster claw meat! And the lobster bisque they cover the sandwich with is great. I love when they give you a bit extra so you can dip your fries in it too.  Some day I'll try something else (having only ever had this sandwich is why I only gave 4 stars), but for now the Steel City Lobster Roll keeps me coming back on its own.",

    "text": "We had our first opportunity to dine at Luke Wholey's last evening ( 10/10/2018). We were with another couple and were both celebrating our anniversary. We were greeted by Tony who then seated us and was our excellent waiter for the evening. The food was exceptional! She crab soup, filet, shrimp, crab cakes were enjoyed by all. There was one hiccup. Three of us ordered Land & Sea. On the menu it stated scallop, shrimp, filet. When served it did not have the scallop but Escovar . When brought to the attention of Tony, he apologized & went to check on this.  Quickly, Michael, the general manager rectified this problem by bringing us the above mentioned scallops & his apology, as well.  This place will definitely be on our list of go to places!! We are also planning on trying their Happy Hour. We enjoyed talking with Tony and Michael All four of us had a very delicious meal and an enjoyable evening!",

On a whim, we decided on Luke's and boy what a gem we found.  Now I'm a sucker for king crab legs.  For years I've been saying that the best Alaskan king crab I've ever had was on the shores of the Chena River in Fairbanks, Alaska at a place called The Pumphouse (I think, it's been a while).  Regardless, the king crab at Luke's ran a very close second and maybe has even overtaken the top spot.  My buddy got the surf and turf and he was able to cut the filet with a butter knife.  If you are ever in da 'burgh I highly recommend Luke's!",

    "text": "We went to Luke Wholey's for the first time as we were eager to try something new. We had an 8pm reservation and were not seated until 8:30. There were plenty of open tables and plenty of upset guests waiting for their table who also had reservations. The restaurant was so backed up they were turning away anyone without a reservation. We finally sat down and didn't see a waiter for about 20minutes when we were finally able to order cocktails and an appetizer. After about 15 more minutes we finally got our drinks but no appetizer. 45minutes later the appetizer finally arrived. We got the lobster bisque fries which did arrive hot (I was worried with how the evening was going they'd be stone cold) and were delicious.   After waiting an additional 45minutes our dinner finally arrived. I was already slightly annoyed by the length we'd waited and how long it took to get even the simplest thing like a fork. I ordered the Baja shrimp volcano. When I ordered it the waiter even commented that it was a fan favorite. The dish consists of mashed potatoes, shrimp, asparagus and a lobster claw. The dish was pretty good with the expectation of the lobster \"claw\". What I received was a small chunk of lobster used in a lobster roll or lobster bisque, not a claw. It was hidden in the mashed potatoes and I had to dig to find it. this restaurant up charges customers for the lobster in this dish and thinks the lobster they served can pass as a claw (photo attached). I saw another customers bowl of lobster bisque and commented that that dish had more lobster in it than my own.   Overall the food was okay but I would seriously think twice about returning. We have been one other time when we just stopped by for drinks at the bar. The bartender informed us the kitchen was closed for 45 minutes and no one could order because they were so backed up. Seems this is an ongoing problem for this restaurant  and they are unable to keep up with the demand.",

Stopping in for a late lunch, the place had a nice vibe going for it and we were seated near the open air area, so lucky it was a nice day out.  I ordered the calamari and my companion ordered lobster bisque fries. Service was very prompt, even though the place seemed moderately busy. After getting our orders, we split them, and rather happily since the lobster bisque fries was a heaping portion. My calamari was good and there was enough for us to share without issue. We did both get plenty of lobster chunks out of the lobster bisque fries, so that was a pleasant surprise, since I was worried we would be short changed with maybe one or two little pieces. We actually both got several good sized chunks of lobster in the fries.  Overall, this was a very good experience that we both enjoyed.",

It is definitely doing well with the 'theme' of a fish restaurant and looks like you are on a fishing boat with neat tables, etc.  Definitely a nice ambiance.  The food was DELICIOUS. Our party started with the Bloody Mary's and they were NOT disappointed.  Also -- definitely try the Bloody Mary shooters -- amazing! my fiance and I shared an ahi tuna salad, and it was phenomenal.  Definitely hit the spot.  To wrap up the meal we had some of the fresh shucked oysters -- what a treat.  The only downside was our waitress -- BUT I'm giving her a pass because it was only her second day and she was young ( I remember those days ... ) Besides that, everything was great, nice service, friendly guests.  If I lived in P-burgh, I'd be back.",

Try their Bloody Mary, which often features a pickle spear garnish, pickled by the bartender himself!  A nice touch.  Service has always been friendly and knowledgeable; what has been inconsistent is the speed and attentiveness, both of which can be spotty.  When you do have a server's attention, all's well with the world.  Luke himself is often at the front of the house, and he's a warm, friendly presence there.  A nice room with a loft feel, good for people-watching on Penn.  A great place to bring out-of-town guests.  Love it!",

I don't know if it's the location (Penn Avenue in the Strip) or if people haven't warmed up to this place yet, but it was very empty with maybe 2 other tables with partons.   Our server was very friendly and attentive - almost too much so - perhaps because he didn't have much to do or was distracted by the fact that one of our friends is a tattoo artist as the server felt it necessary to show off his ink. We're easy-going people, so it wasn't that big of a deal.   The food was good - I enjoyed my seared yellowtail but there were only 2 small pieces and nearly a cup of rice on my plate. So my portions were a bit unbalanced and skimpy for the $23 price tag. Mr. J had the land and sea - while his steak seemed a bit overcooked, the scallops were seared perfectly and were delicious.   I'm bummed I missed the all-you-can-eat blue crabs that were on special two weekends ago. I think LWWAG could benefit from having things like this more often. I think that's what would get me to go back.",

At one point, they had one of the best happy hours in the city.  Good beers were discounted and several food items were also.  The specials were great, but they make you work for them.  First, if you get seated in one half of the restaurant, there are no happy hour specials.  So, if you order items that are half-off during happy hour, it will cost twice as much if you sit at one table compared to another.  Arbitrary and ridiculous.  Second, you will never get the half-off specials.  Every time I have gone, or anyone I know for that matter, they will charge you full price and you have to then ask (embarrassingly) for them to correct it.  I'm not talking about once or twice this happening, but literally every single time myself or anyone I know has gone here.   Once is a mistake, twice is chance, but after that it is obviously deliberate.    In short, as much as I like this place, these shady business practices don't deserve your business.",

He really seemed to care about his customers, giving us additional information about our dishes.   We all ordered seafood, since that is their specialty. I had a curry dish with lobster, mussels, shrimp and scallops over rice. It was nicely flavored without being overbearing. My wife had fish and chips which was also nicely done.

Also, I'm a huge fan of all food under the sea.  But it just hasn't quite figured out what it wants to be.    The premade caesar salad, fresh out of the cooler with the dressing on the side, and the servers in shorts and sneakers makes it seem like a casual bar place (no liquor license though...be warned!  Bring your own, or they'll let you bring something from across the street).    The prices of the (limited) entrees (all over $20) and the super-over-attentive service makes it seem like it's aiming for fine dining.  And then there's the loud top 40 music and the big projection on the wall of music trivia, like you're watching the comcast \"today's hits\" music channel, which makes it seem like a nightclub.  Yeah, I'm baffled.  The fish entrees were fresh and delicious (although portions were too much...maybe cut the price AND the size?) and we had some incredible cheesecake.  Everyone was so nice and the place was so empty and really, I'd love for them to succeed.  But unfortunately, I don't think I'll be going back.",

Since we were in the vicinity we stopped by anyway, lucky us there were two tables available in the bar area.  We started with the Thai chili catfish bites; the lightly breaded catfish bites are fried but not heavy or greasy, they are paired with a traditional sweet chili sauce and lemon.  The sushi being prepared was very inviting and since soft shell crabs were in season we ordered a spider roll, the roll was fresh, the crab was delicious, a very nice compliment to dinner.  We then enjoyed the Mexican shrimp volcano, I asked if the shrimp could be fried instead of grilled and the answered yes but they arrived grilled anyway, also the lobster claw was missing. Our attentive server was quick to remedy the missing lobster issue. None the less the dish was good, the shrimp were large and juicy, using bisque as a topper for the mashed potatoes was also a nice touch.  For dessert we had the turtle cheesecake which was a delicious way to end our meal.  Will dine here again the next time I'm in Pittsburgh",

Well, that's Luke Wholey, who recently opened up his own restaurant on The Strip!  Open air dining where large up-cycled wooden cable rolls are surrounded by comfy chairs offer upbeat music for diners both upstairs and downstairs.   As you approach, Luke Wholey is busy grilling sock-eyed salmon, jumbo shrimp and giant scallops and serving them with grilled zucchini slices, smoked red peppers and baby bok choy over your choice of steamed brown rice or sticky rice.  The freshly made lobster bisque a la Wholey's is 'slap yo momma good.' And that is just a sampling of items on the menu.  Best to call in, phone in or text in your lunch order if you've got a short lunch like me because The Wild Alaskan Grille is still going through some newbie growing pains.

Been done with dinner for an hour now tryn to figure out the check. Multiple wrong orders. Staff is rude. 1 dinner that was 26 dollars consisted of 4 shrimp and 2 scallops. Like come on really. They get 1 star for bringing 5 extra shrimp. Place was like 100 degrees as well.   Update finally the owner came and gave us free apps and split the bill.",

I ordered the swordfish and it was very fishy tasting with a mushy consistency.  My boyfriend had scallops and shrimp which seemed to be over cooked and small. We did have the lobster Mac and cheese which was pretty delicious compared to the rest of the food. The restaurant was very busy and the waiter told us that the kitchen was getting slammed. It could have been a bad night to try this place but I doubt I will try it again. It was very overpriced for the quality of food. There are too many fabulous restaurants in Pittsburgh to visit instead.",

He said the mix is made from scratch in house, love that. They had a pickle in them and two giant head-on cocktail shrimp, and a lemon, lime, and olive. He was funny and we had a good time chatting with him. Me and my friend D walked to the front with me to see what the oysters of the day were, they're half off on Tuesdays!!!!! Two servers came over and told us about the different options and suggested their favorites. We had the St.Simon and I think the other might have been called wildcats? They were cleaned good and shucked right. When we left, my other friend left his phone and charger there. Brett found me on facebook within 5 minutes of us leaving and let me know he had it! way cool!",

The lobster bisque fries were decent but could've definitely used more lobster. $11 for a piece of crab and some bisque with a basket of fries doesn't get me.  The tiger roll was alright, but not as flavorful as I had hoped - with 4 different ingredients, I would've expected flavor explosions in my mouth... Not the case.  Their lunch specials seemed like okay pickings. They serve a ton of edamame with their meals.",

We studied the menu and decided on an oyster appetizer (all the hubby.... & at 1/2 off).... Lobster Mac n cheese,  provolone wedges & chicken poppers with Buffalo sauce.   Everything came out in a timely manner.  Jayme (the bartender)  was friendly without being over bearing. The hubs loved his oysters & lobster Mac.  I really enjoyed my provolone wedges & chicken poppers. I was honestly full on just the cheese wedges!    There was a young man shucking (is that the right word?!)  oysters and the owner must not have liked how he was doing it because he came over,  scolded the kid and started doing it himself.  It was really unprofessional,  especially because we were sitting less than 3 feet away and could hear everything!   We will be back..... But not because of the owner,  but rather for the food and service.",

I had the calamari, and spring rolls from their made-to-order sushi bar. All were well worth it.   The atmosphere is pleasant. Great for a date night or family/friends gathering.

With the check I used a $12 off Enjoy Coupon Book coupon. When server returned with the adjusted check, he pointed out restaurant's policy when using Enjoy coupon was to automatically add an 18% gratuity to the subtotal before discount. Not only is that not stated on their coupon but when calculating the 18%, they do it not just on the subtotal before discount but they add on the 7% sales tax. Tipping norms are that you don't include the amount WITH tax, when calculating tip, but it's the amount WITHOUT tax.",

    "text": "I have no idea where to start with this visit . The waitress  seemed very confused and didnt mention specials  til we decided to order but hey whatever. Me and a guest started by ordering the lobster fries ( which were decent  )  then we ordered our entrees i had to tell the waitress i wanted my steak medium as she never asked and walked away. My guest got a chicken salad and I ordered the land and sea with the add on lobster tail.   A guy brought out our food and we never saw the waitress for a good 20 minutes so i was unable to inform her my steak came out well done ( tough and no pink at all )  so once the waitress does come over i inform her and she says i will take care of it .    About 10 minutes after me and my guest notice a man walking in from outside with clothing from a dry cleaners?  And he looks around then slowly walks to my table and says whats the matter?    Stunned as to who he is, i said my steak was cooked in connectly. He says he is sorry to hear and it will be taken care of and to please try them again he is the owners father , so i figured okay things will be fixed no problem.   So the manager/ chef who brought our food out comes over and says what seems to be the issue i explained the steak situation and was confused why i would pay $45 for a steak he says oh you didn't eat it?  ( must not be any communication)  so he says he will remove it, returns and only $25 was credited? At this point ive been done eating for nearly 40 minutes so i just pay for my bill and want to leave. As im walking outside the older gentleman approaches me and says was everything taken care of ( is there any communication is this place ? )   i explained not to my liking and he seems shocked and i tell him i eat out at many place quite a bit and he assures me he is sorry and to come back in and it will be all fixed this time because a life long customer is worth $22,000 .   I walk back in ( big mistake)  so the manager/ cook guy says what seems to be the problem, i explian my situation with the steak again and he says sir i cooked your steak it was cooked to 140degress and it was pink .   I question how it was pink if you didn't cut into it nor did you see the steak after i was served it? He said that my 3 pieces of shrimp and potatoes were worth the $20 that was not refunded and theres nothing else he can offer except dessert which he did offer initially. I decided to leave.  My question is who is this guy that approaches me at a restaurant he doesn't even work at and why did he try to help more then the staff?  I've read of atleast 1 of this exact experience with this guy... Weird!",

It was a slow night (but also a Pens game- so that worked to our benefit) started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Calamari. Large Shrimp that were very good (just not chilled cold) but that's really my only complaint on the whole meal. Shrimp cocktail, to me, should be very cold. These were room temperature. I had the Shrimp Volcano. Mashed potatoes topped with Lobster bisque and shrimp. Very nice. The asparagus was perfect. My husband had the crab topped salmon and said it was delicious.  We shared the flourless chocolate torte and added a scoop of ice cream. Would recommend this place to anyone in the area.",

    "text": "I visited Luke Wholey's earlier tonight for dinner with my parents.  I'd been wanting to try it for a long while now, so given that they're fans of good seafood and that I had a City Dining Card for it, this gave me the push necessary to try it.  We started out by ordering the lobster bisque fries ($11), given that it was one of the more unique menu items and that many other Yelpers recommended them.  They consisted of fries over lobster bisque with chunks of lobster topped with scallions, and were the highlight of the meal.  If you like poutine, you'll enjoy them, for sure.  Because I wanted to try the lobster bisque by itself, I decided to order a cup of it with my meal ($7).  This turned out to be a mistake, given that it was too salty and rich for my taste, and that I felt that it was overpriced (for a cup).  If you're considering stopping here for lunch, bear in mind that you can get 4-5 times the amount of crab-lobster bisque of comparable quality across the street (with more seafood, no less!) in a quick serve setting at Wholey's Fish Market for less $.  For our entrees, my mom ordered the crab cake salad ($15.95), my dad ordered the baja shrimp volcano ($28), and I ordered the crab stuffed salmon ($30).  While my salmon was well cooked and tasty with the sauce, it didn't blow my mind the way I expect for an entree at this price point.  Also, the bok choy served with my entree seemed a bit limp when served, and there was a piece of skin underneath my salmon.  While these may seem like minor details, I have a higher standard for fine dining-esque than for mid-range restaurants, so I can't let them slide.  I tried a piece of my mom's crabcake and some of the potatoes from my dad's volcano, and again, they seemed tasty, but not mind-blowing.  They both seemed satisfied enough--though they're not as exacting as I am when it comes to eating out.  On the a positive note, our service was very good, so I have no complaints there.  The atmosphere is more casual than I was expecting, which fits with the atmosphere of the Strip District, but not with the fine dining-esque nature of the restaurant.  I concur with another reviewer that I'd be willing to give this place another shot for lunch (or happy hour), I don't think I'd be willing to pay dinner prices again.  Since my opinion is hovering between 3 and 4 stars, I'm splitting the difference and going with 3.5.",

We got lunch entrees which were the sweet soy ahi tuna on a bed of wild rice & book choy, 2 orders of lobster bisque fries, 2 bloody Mary's, & 1 bourbon on the rocks and our bill was $70!! The tuna had no flavor, you couldn't even cut the bok choy with a knife it was so hard, and the rice was not good either. The fries were just okay. The only good thing about the meal was the shrimp on the Bloody Mary. It was totally no where near worth $70 plus a tip. I would give 5 stars for service and 1 for the food and the price. Go down the street to Wholey's, get fresh seafood and make it yourself...even if you've never cooked a meal in your life, I'm sure it would taste better!! So disappointing!!!",

It was hands down the best thing we ate on Friday evening.  Sliced paper thin, nearly melt in your mouth, the presentation with fruits and veggies, it was just fantastic. My husband had an upgraded Alaskan white salmon for his entree.  He could not stop raving about it.  It was light and flakey, very flavorful and grilled perfectly.  My entree was grilled sea scallops and shrimp.",

That said, the 3 star rating is because some weren't excellent and the ambience was challenged on this particular evening because the restaurant was extremely cold. The calamari appetizer was mediocre. The lobster roll would have been excellent if it could be handled. The bun was hard and could not fold to envelop the lobster. That made it open-faced. The crab-stuffed salmon was very good. In the shrimp scampi with linguine, the shrimp were very tasty, but the whole dish seemed a bit heavy. Interesting atmosphere and, with a few more patrons, could have a nice energy. We'd try it again, but the second time has to be a charm.",

The fish, shrimp and scallops were also just OK.  I had been hoping that with the family connection there would be simple, super fresh seafood. Not sure they have the right cook yet, or maybe an off night. The piles of fresh steamed crabs looked great, and it's a nice place to sit. But I'm super picky, used to work in the seafood business for awhile. I'd try them again but they need to improve. My two friends felt the same way.",

I wanted to make a reservation early because I know how difficult it can be finding a place to eat in Pittsburgh without a wait during big events and the marathon was the same weekend we were going. We called a couple of weeks in advance and let them know we had a person in a wheelchair. When we arrived they had our table ready to go and a place specifically set up for our wheelchair.(very impressive) Our waitress, Heidi, was great. She knew the menu and gave us recommendations if we asked, We had a group of 8 so we had good sampling of the menu. The crab legs were delicious and we loved that you had the option of getting them cracked for you so you get right to the meat no mess involved. The oysters on the half shell were fresh and delicious, We also had the tuna which was high quality and cooked to perfection. Others in our party had the lobster bisque, swordfish, stuffed salmon, sushi and desserts. Not one person had anything left on their plate at the end of the meal. This meal was so delicious we were still talking about it the next day. We also liked the fact that we could get great quality seafood in a relaxed and semi-casual environment. We will definitely be back when we return to Pittsburgh so we can try some of the other menu items. i forgot to mention that the owner was at the door when we went to leave and asked us if we enjoyed our meal, he acted genuinely interested in our opinion. Oh and did I say anything about the Bloody Mary's and the house sangria? They were both delicious as well!",

    "text": "This was my first time here. When I was here in the Strip District last year, we had plans but we ended up in their fish market instead. Now here I am. I ordered the Panko and parmesan cheese breaded broiled cod. I also ordered the Peel and eat Baja flavored shrimp. I didn't expect these shrimp to be made cold. It has the Baja flavor alright but maybe I expected it to be steamed or something. The cod also was okay, tasted okay. My partner's order was crab stuffed salmon which he liked, though he said it was a bit overcooked. We shared an appetizer which is the calamari, and that really did hit the spot. I like the restaurants interior, with all those colorful wall painting, showing a carp and a giant octopus on one whole wall. It gives out a sort of homey feeling. Our server Tommy did a good job and was very attentive and I appreciate this. Overall it was a good experience. But I think they are too pricey. Would come back to bring  family who visits, but will not come on a regular basis. It's just too pricey!",

The menu is all seafood, the dining room is high and loud and painted with murals and not overly clean, and the customers span the whole range of humanity, excluding the elite. It's unique and great, if that's what you're looking for. The food was good and includes some unusual twists on traditional seafood dishes. We had lobster bisque, fish tacos, and lobster mac and cheese. Everything was good. The wine list is very limited but did contain a nice California Chardonnay at a reasonable price. The server took good care of us but didn't seem to enjoy it very much. We'll return when we're ready for another beach experience.",

    "text": "When in The Strip there are so many \"must see\" shops and restaurants, but the consistency of Luke Wholey's restaurant keeps this brick and mortar at the top of my list. This restaurant does it all. Established in 2012, the full service restaurant and bar is complete with an oyster and sushi bar as well. The menu has every type of seafood under the sea, and a huge variety of lunch and dinner entrees. From simple fried cod sandwiches, to decadent Baja shrimp scampi linguini, to lighter fare salmon and beet salads, starters like lobster bisque soup, shrimp cocktail, an entire sushi menu, and even burgers, I would imagine there's something here for everyone. Being a vegan my go-to is always vegetable sushi and their side house salad - a generous portion of greens, carrots, cucumber, cherry tomato, red onion, topped with house-made croutons and their house-made salad dressings. Sounds simple, but it's perfectly delicious, always hits the spot, and is always fresh as can be. Their full bar menu always has a great selection of draft beer and bottles, with lots of local brews in the mix. If you're ever in the mood for a Bloody Mary and you haven't yet tried theirs, Wholey's is THE place to get one. My boyfriend cannot get enough and has yet to find one, in and outside of Pittsburgh that holds a candle to theirs. Option to get yours topped with a slice of bacon, shrimp cocktail, or go big with the fried crab. Aside from all the food and drink being top notch, the staff is so cheerful and eager to serve you. In the warmer months the retractable windows/doors open and some tables are right in the fresh air. The bar area is nice and open with several TVs, snag an empty seat if you see one! This place is always bustling, always packed with people, but that means they're doing something right. Great experience, great service, great food, what more could you ask for. Looking forward to my next stop in!",

The lobster bisque was the consistency of pudding and had very little flavor. The sushi roll had an overpowering bitter taste. And the key lime pie had a disappointing filling, at least the crust was ok. The server did replace the lobster bisque with the Manhattan clam chowder, which was better but contained no seafood. I have two stars because I had been here before and thought it was pretty good. But this experience was one of the worst I've had at any \"higher quality\" restaurants. I am literally walking to go eat somewhere else as I write this because I am still hungry. I'd rather go get a pepperoni roll on the street than eat here again.",

We walked into a restaurant that had two people in it. Not a good sign around dinner time. The \"sushi bar\" is about 6 feet wide and looks like it was an afterthought. This place is clearly a bar. The restaurant had TVs all over the place and the actual bar was almost the length of the restaurant. Clearly their focus. After we decided, based on observation, to not eat here we decided to have a drink while we looked for our next spot. My drink was not good. Poor flavor and no alcohol at all. I took two sips just to be sure and I was done. Fair enough that we didn't eat here but after some observations we decided to skip it. Maybe we missed something but our experience wasn't good.",

Both were good! For my meal, I had the crab Mac n cheese on the crab fest menu for October. I wasn't really a huge fan because cheese-it's were crumbled on top, and I'm not a huge cheese-it fan. The crab on top was great though! I just wish there was more, especially for $25.",

This visit I had the breakfast special, your choice of blackened ahi tuna, blackened swordfish, or steak, two eggs cooked to your liking, and home fries and toast. I went with the swordfish with eggs over easy.   I happen to understand how to properly blacken fish. One key is for the filet to be thick enough so that when it's seared in a red hot cast iron skillet it doesn't over cook, is moist and not dried out. They missed the mark with a thin fillet that was over cooked and so somewhat dry.   The home fries were good though, and the eggs were properly over easy. There was no options for the type of toast though. - just toasted Italian bread.   Others in my family had the longest lobster roll, which my son and wife said was sub par. She knows her lobster rolls!  My 2 daughters had the crab cake sandwich and loved it.   It's not that I won't go back here, but might limit my order to the Bloody Mary!",

Normally sandwiches come with French fries but for a slight upcharge you can have a salad. I opted for that since it was a hot day. We got our food fairly quickly. I had a nice size side salad which was very good. My crabcake sandwich had real crabmeat in it and I was blown away by it. So good and so filling. My son enjoyed the blackened salmon which was prepared to his liking.  This is one restaurant which will automatically add 18% tip to your bill. I have heard these tips are popping up on checks in some restaurants in Pittsburgh.  Very good lunch and very good service to boot. Located across from Mon Aimme Chocolat in the Strip District.",

The eel nigiri was dry, and the seaweed wrapper was simply laid on top, as opposed to actually wrapping it.  We also got an eel roll with avocado and cucumber.  There was no avocado in it at all, and it was very loosely rolled, so it fell apart as we ate it.   Nothing was horrible, but we were quite disappointed. If you've got the Wholey name in Pittsburgh, we are going to expect good seafood. Luke Wholey was an embarrassment to the name, at least as the sushi goes.",

The atmosphere is pretty urban-music, lighting, etc.  The high top tables which were actually old cable/wiring spools were neat and the seating was well spread out.  Oysters were good, and the spicy tuna appetizer was the highlight.  Sushi-grade tuna with a spicy coating served atop wasabi cold slaw.    The tuna was so good, I ordered it again for my entree, this time as sweet and spicy with similar coating and a lighter teriyaki glaze.   Wasabi mashed potatoes actually contained a little bit of spice-normally I get pulled in with the description and they're no different than regular ones, not these!   Good drink menu and the draft beers were cold.   I'd recommend coming here whether you're a local or occasional visitor to the area like myself.",

    "text": "The food at this place was so good that my bf all but licked the plate I didnt even yell at him for it.  The food at this place is so good we even ate the garnishes and I am not ashamed.  Hot tip (for right now, May 18 2013):  there is a GROUPON for this restaurant, and as I'd been dying to try this place I bought one and made reservations the same night.  I'd been curious about htis place bc I used to drink here back in the 00's when I was young and the space was called Deja Vu inside.  It still looks like Deja Vu with the mulitple levels of seating and its gorgeous inside.  This would be a good restaurant for a date, dinner with the family, or a business dinner.  Our table had a beta fish on it which was pretty cool--until I almost knocked the bowl off the table bc I am clumsy.  Poor fish.  :(  We had no problems getting a reservation and were seated immediately upon our arrival--no waiting.  While the place did not feel packed, every table was full so I would recommend making a reservation, especially since they have a Groupon now.  I had the crab stuffed salmon and my bf had the seafood lasagna.  He was eating the seafood lasagna before the waitress had even set the plate down and I dont blame him, it looked FANTASTC.  The sauce was kind of a cheesy vodka sauce that was to die for and came with shrimp and scallops on the top of the lasagna, and he said they were mixed inside the lasagna as well.  When I asked him for a taste he gave me the most pathetic little corner bite.  It was very good but honestly, he wasnt sharing and he just looked so happy I wasn't going to press the issue.   the sauce was incredible.  My salmon was cooked perfectly and tasted amazing.  Everything was cooked perfectly.  It came with roasted red potatoes and bok choy.  I've been thinking about the salmon since I had it.  Also, I noticed the $$$ price listing for this place.  Do you really want discount seafood?  Really?  I thought the prices were surprisingly moderate for the quality of the food you are getting and the overall dining experience.  I would not consider this to be an expensive restaurant, most of the entrees were $25 or lower.  I can't wait to come back ot this restaurant and try their brunch.  I also saw several other tables order sushi and it looked very good--I reallly cant wait to try it.  They also said they make the best bloody mary in town but----thats wrong bc *I* make the best bloody marys ever, so we'll just have to agree to disagree.  :)  Also--try the cheese cake.  OMG I dont know where they get it from but it was amazing.  I want to describe it further but I can't bc I need profanity to explain just how #$*%& good it was.  I love seafood and this is my new favorite dining spot in the Strip District!",

There were HUGE chunks of it!  The apps were devine!  I had the seared Ahi Tuna with Jasmine rice and aspargus for my main course.  It was cooked to perfection, not overdone.  The Jasmine rice had excellent flavor.  The hubby got the fried catfish sandwich with fries and thoroughly enjoyed it.  It was big and he said as far as fried catfish, it was some of the best he's had.  The service was great, even though according to our waitress they were short staffed.  The place itself has a very cool vibe.  We will most certainly go back sometime soon!",

Apparently he likes the same band as my husband does. After knowing this fact, they talked as if they were a long lost brother. Lol.  We had lobster bisque fries, perfect! Salmon sashimi and oysters, fresh! And oh my god their steel city lobster roll, was insane! To my taste, it was even more delicious than the infamous lobster roll in lobster shack.  Would definitely be back here! Will have to try their sushi and desserts!",

We had a couple of cocktails while we waited for dinner. They had a nice menu of customized mixed drinks, and they tasted good. Appetizer consisted on 2 dozen fresh oysters. Nothing fancy needed here, they were fresh, cold, and tasted great!  For dinner I had a the Wild Alaskan sushi roll. It was packed with thick pieces of fresh crab meat, and really satisfied. Other meals ordered at the table were the lobster mac 'n cheese (made with multiple cheeses that smelled soooo good from across the table!), baked cod topped with lump crab meat (it was melt-in-your-mouth), and baja fish tacos (boasted by my fiance as the \"best fish tacos ever\").   We rounded everything out with pumpkin cheesecake and vanilla bourbon cheesecake. I am not a cheesecake person-definitely a dessert person-just not cheesecake, but these were exceptional! Had I not already been so full from dinner I would've annihilated them.  Can't wait to go back.",

I guess I appreciate that it's a local staple, and the seafood is as good as some of the better places in Pittsburgh. Still not as good as most coastal seafood places I've been in Baltimore, Boston, New York, California, etc. I will say this - Luke Wholey did come say hi to us and asked how our meal was. That was a really sweet touch that did win me over a bit. The prices are a bit steep, but I guess you get the seafood you pay for. I'm still a Penn Ave Fish Company supporter! I might be back for lunch, but I probably wouldn't pay dinner prices again.",

As for food, my wife and I ordered a fish and chips platter that included fries, cole slaw fish 2 scallops and 4 shrimp, all fried.

I still don't know. I'm trying so hard to enjoy LWWAG, but maybe it just needs some time...  Luke was outside to greet us and was enthusiastic about us coming in. After having an oyster bloody mary shooter (it sounds weird, but it was delicious), we decided that we'd do our shopping and then come back for a bite to eat.  The oysters were excellent. The food was prepared well. The crabcake was alright--we ordered it mostly because the server said it was different from other crabcakes (it wasn't) and she really like the aioli (which they forgot to give us). No big deal, though, we asked for it and after a few minutes our server came out with it.  So, here's the reason this review is boring: I feel so ambivalent about this place. One person sat us, another person introduced themselves as a hostess, another person brought us water, yet another person introduced herself as our server, and then two other girls checked in on us at various times. Who was taking care of us? Who was remembering what we had? Who had any interest in our experience? We were told the same thing by at least three of the people...and why would you recommend a dish because everyone enjoys the aioli and then forget the aioli? What?!  Also, I don't know if I can justify the price of the food with what was presented. That being said, it's a new restaurant and the space has so much promise (it could be open a little later, it could have a nice bar and some drinks, it could get rid of that screen playing God-knows-what while they're trying to charge you for a $20 entree) and the people are so friendly that I think it just needs time to settle in.  I can't wait to go back and try LWWAG again in a few months.",

    "text": "Apparently, we committed a cardinal sin by coming to the door without a reservation on a Saturday night. The maitre d' told us to leave (jokingly) then said he'd find us a table despite our lack of reservation.   30 minutes later, after repeatedly being asked if we had a reservation as though we had not just had the exact same conversation, we were seated at a table that had been empty the entire time.  The maitre d' then proceeded to do everything but read the menu to us item by item. This ended up being beyond uncomfortable due to his total lack of respect for personal space and the overwhelming odor of his pomade.  I thought perhaps this all was a fluke, but I watched the same thing happen 4 times over the course of our meal.  House mismanagement continued as there was apparent confusion  over who was to be our server. Once they decided amongst themselves, we waited a further 10 minutes to place our drink order which took a further 10 minutes to deliver. By this time we had been at the restaurant for almost an hour and only then did we order our food. Going by the heavily pomaded gentleman's recommendation, I ordered from the \"best sushi menu in Pittsburgh.\" only to be told that only the items with asterisks next to them were actually available. After another round of deliberation and waiting we finally got our food order in.   The peel and eat shrimp and oyster platter was fine. Of the 3 different kinds of oysters provided, only one had a lovely clean fresh taste. The peel and eat shrimp was fantastic.   My sushi came out and contained cream cheese. I sent it back as the wrong order because the salmon roll I ordered from the menu didn't say it came with creme cheese. I got the same order back and was told that the salmon roll comes with creme cheese and who doesn't like creme cheese and salmon? By this point, I would have eaten my own arm so I accepted the dish which was mediocre at best. The rice was extremely sweet and the fish was firm, but rather tasteless.   When our main course came out-- fish and chips-- we requested the usual condiments-- vinegar and ketchup and salt, since everything  on the plate seemed as though it was unsalted. 15 minutes later, after watching our waiter pass by and deliver drinks and condiments to no fewer than 3 other tables and bar back fro a bit, I pulled a bus boy aside and requested the condiments again. He brought them back in a matter of moments.   Our waiter then returned to see how we were doing and I told him that his bus boy had delivered what we requested. He hovered around the table apologizing for a minute or two before faffing off and not returning with our requested check for another, I kid you not, half an hour.   If the quality of the fish and shrimp were not so good and well cooked, I would be giving this restaurant one star and i definitely wont' be returning.",

The ambience was inviting and the staff was friendly + attentive despite being understaffed during our visit. The food while fresh was good, just maybe not great (albeit we ate from the Pittsburgh Restaurant Week menu) nor worthy of such a price point. The sushi and soup were strong appetizers; however the lobster/crab ravioli was on the small size with an overly rich cream sauce that congealed on the plate. The halibut was small yet excellent and was paired alongside a root vegetable cake with a sweet citrus glaze. The last bite did leave a lasting sweet impression of rich chocolate mousse though -- dare you to eat just one bite. A second \"normal\" visit from the standard menu has been warranted.",

We didn't wait for a table at all and we did not feel rushed once we decided all we wanted to do was enjoy a few drinks. The only reasons for 4 stars is because we were sitting at an extremely low table. My husband is 5 foot 11 and this was certainly not comfortable for him, I'm sure. The other reason is because it seemed a little pricey, however I didn't mind paying for seafood that tasted this delicious. We will definitely be back!",

My husband called ahead for reservations for six on a Saturday night, and he informed the restaurant that his father was in a wheelchair, and would need to be accommodated. They said it would be fine.   When we arrived, they had planned for six, but not for the wheelchair. The majority of their restaurant is comprised tables with wide bases, which would prohibit my father-in-law from reaching the table. The tables that would have worked were occupied, but we said we would wait. As soon as those tables were available, the staff was quick to prep them for us to be seated.   Our server. Maybe just an off day? He couldn't seem to remember much. We asked him to stop filling a water glass for my FIL (for health reasons), but he needed to be reminded. Then, I asked for a club soda, and he forgot about that. My sister-in-law asked about the preparation of the crab legs, and he said he would check on that-  nope. Forgot. Then I asked for extra ginger and he'd forgotten. Then I asked the manager, who brought my husband's dinner later than the rest of ours, and he brought it within minutes.  AND I presented the Yelp coupon when we ordered the appetizer, and HE FORGOT TO TAKE IT OFF THE CHECK! This may all have been just a slight annoyance if the servers weren't gathered at the bar talking for long periods of time during our meal.   The food: ok   Lobster bisque fries Pretty sure this could have been labeled gravy fries, and no one would know the difference.   Sushi: pretty good!  Grilled Georges Bank Swordfish dinner The potatoes weren't cooked completely, so they were that hardened, grainy texture. The fish was good.   My in laws were impressed by the lobster tail and asparagus.   I don't think I'll be returning, as poor service is one of the biggest turn offs for me. The music is too loud for normal conversation as well.",

We knew we'd be back. So we went for dinner and absolutely loved it!! At first glance the menu appears to not have an abundance of choices but there are specials based on availability of fresh fish which will supplement the base menu. And so it was on our visit. Soft shell crabs were in and I have such a weakness for them I'll pretty much order them anytime I see them. I was not disappointed. While I prefer then sauteed, these were fried but not greasy and were spectacularly flavorful and fresh. A good generous serving left me full to the brim, but I did have room for the second East End.... My wife's fish special (which she generously shared - she's good about that!) was a wild atlantic cod with fresh blue crab on top and  was so tasty and fresh that we each were satisfied when we left, knowing that we won't be strangers to this place.   The atmosphere is open air and consistent with the theme of the place. A good bar, some great fresh seafood, unlimited oysters....this is a welcome addition to the Pittsburgh dining scene. See you there!",

The employees and bartenders were extremely busy yet found time to engage with us and the patrons around us. The surrounding dining room looked as if it was taken from an Alaskan landscape.  This place seemed super cool. Unfortunately we were just having drinks but I'm looking forward to dining with them in the near future.   Five star Bloody Mary!!",

    "text": "Several weeknights ago, with Kay's hand in mine, the duo that is us walked several blocks once I met her at work half past the hour of 5 in search of Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille, a curveball thrown by her ('I don't feel like cooking tonight.') prompting this excursion.   I knew it was on Penn Avenue, but aside from that, I had forgotten where it was!   So we stayed on the move, the late afternoon sun glaring upon us until I caught sight of a  fearsome, azure fish mounted on a wall of stone above the restaurant's stylized logo.   Thirsty and relieved to find the place, I crept in cautiously as dapper men and leggy women cavorted about the colorful interiors while a monstrous swordfish loomed over them. I even witnessed veteran local television news anchor Sally Wiggin in attendance \"living it up\" as they say. Would I be welcome among this seemingly upper-crust, formally-dressed crowd in my lightly soiled t-shirt and jungle fatigues?  That's when I literally stumbled into Luke Wholey himself wearing blue jeans and a polo shirt.   \"You're fine, man,\" he said waving his palm when I asked about my appearance. It suddenly felt as if we'd grown up together even though I'd never before met him, his enthusiastically entrepreneurial, seafaring, and youthful visage being a fixture of Pittsburgh billboard advertising over the past few years.   \"Man, these tables look familiar,\" I mentioned as we were seated in front of massive reels of wood meant for electrical wire. Luke informed me that they'd been procured from my employer as a band began to set up their instruments behind us. My ease was now complete. \"So let's eat!\" I exclaimed.  Kay is rarely in the mood for raw oysters, so we went with my secondary choice, the Catfish Bites, to kick off our dinner.   Besprinkled with pungent Cajun spices, dredged in a cornmeal coating, fried to an exquisite bronze, and served with a sticky, honeyed sauce, the cubes of ray-finned polliwog were so newly captured as to be ethereal, vanishing in my mouth, leaving only a cakey, demon-dusted breading and freshwater flavors behind.   My entree was the extravagant Broiled Atlantic Cod. Topped with Colossal  Lump Blue Crab, the crustacean's most premium meat, served with smashed potatoes, garnished with grilled asparagus, and topped with a bisque-ish Lobster cream sauce, there was nothing but divinely moist pleasures to be had, only the spuds and vegetables providing earthen respites between the aquatic, erotic morsels of recently-expired marine life. The luscious, juicy crabmeat and cod vaporized just as the mudcat before it had, the ripe, not-overcooked asparagus and lumpen tuber heap adding some texture, the sauce ramping up the decadence dance as a Hollandaise would an Eggs Benedict.   Dessert was a wedge of uncanny cheesecake from A. Ward's of Carnegie. Therefore, it warranted a separate review.  There were a few very minute gaffes, but our able and toned server Alyssa rectified them all gracefully.   3/4 of the way through our meal, we were approached by the establishment's profoundly professional and personable host whose name I can't recall. As classy and charming as Johnny Carson, he recounted Luke's story to us, engaging us and our fellow patrons with his witty persona, visiting every table, hugging and hand-shaking like the man-of-the-people he indubitably is, treating each guest like a good friend.   Take from this what thou wilt: Luke Wholey is serving up the finest, the freshest seafood I've ever had the privilege of tasting in this humble metropolis, our experience confirming my theory that if a grille is bearing the century-famous Wholey's name, only a blessed seafood tour de force can be had there. Clock in, spend some time with Luke, and sample the rivers, lakes, seas, and oceans of the world while never leaving the city limits.",

This was the first time that I was bringing my husband to Luke Wholey's and was excited for him to try what I had felt was the best seafood restaurant in the area.    I ordered the shrimp and scallop entree (blackened) and the shrimps were rubbery and the seasoning made the shrimp and scallops so dry.  While you could tell the shrimp and scallops were fresh they were overseasoned with the blackening spices and it completely overpowered all other tastes of the meal.  We ordered the lobster fries and calamari as an appetizer and I will say that these were good.  The cocktail I ordered was terrible but perhaps that had more to do with my personal preference in taste than the drink itself.  It was Wholey's version of the Moscow Mule (which I usually love) but they use Crown Royal Maple rum which made me feel like I was drinking watered down maple syrup.  It didn't have that limey refreshing taste that I usually enjoy.    My husband ordered the Salmon entree and he was underwhelmed and said that the Salmon I had made the night before was better...and it was frozen Salmon!    While I was really disappointed in the meal overall, I won't let it deter me from giving this place another try.",

    "text": "This was my third visit to Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille - my brother and I took our parents here to celebrate their 50th wedding pre-anniversary celebration.  My parents live in Beaver County and they rarely come to Pittsburgh for anything - in fact my mom is so stubborn that she generally refuses to come but we raved about the delicious Alaskan King Crab Legs and the service so much that my dad was able to convince her to come out here for dinner.    We arrived and were seated right away (with a reservation) and the garage door-style windows were open which allowed a lot of light and a nice breeze to come in.  We were seated in Drew's section who was trained by the marvelous Kevin (good job training Drew, Kevin) and Drew was just as wonderful and attentive as Kevin has been on our previous visits.  Mr. Wholey (Luke's dad) was also there making the rounds and when they found out that it was my parents' anniversary and my dad's birthday soon they made sure to throw in dessert.    For appetizers we ordered the catfish bites and the peel and eat shrimp, plus my dad got the lobster bisque.  The peel and eat shrimp was seasoned with Old Bay and came with a tangy cocktail sauce that had a little bit of a kick.  The catfish bites were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside and were delicious when paired with the Thai Chili dipping sauce.  They had frozen margaritas and frozen mojitos as their drink specials and Drew was kind enough to bring small samples so that we could decide - both were delicious!  If they are ever on the bar menu when you go they are both definitely worth the indulgence and especially refreshing on a hot day.  For our entrees we ordered 3 orders of the Alaskan King Crab Legs along with an order of the swordfish steak stuffed with crab.  Everything was delicious.  The crab is so sweet and tender that you do not even need to dip it in butter - in fact the butter almost detracts from the rich flavor of the crab meat.  My parents shared the swordfish and an order of the crab legs and we all had enough to take home for leftovers.  After dinner they brought us over a huge piece of cheesecake that we shared between the four of us.  Drew was incredibly kind, conscientious, and attentive.  One of the best parts of going to Luke's is the outstanding service!   Treat your servers well and they will take very good care of you!  My dad who is going to 88 said that it was one of the best meals he has ever had!  I have already suggested Luke's for my office Christmas party this year and I will continue to recommend this restaurant.  They have the freshest seafood available in Pittsburgh in a relaxed atmosphere and the service is heads above most other restaurants that I've been to not just in Pittsburgh but in the whole U.S., which is key to getting customers to return.  I will always think twice before returning to an establishment where I've gotten bad service, even if the food is good (See my review of Carmi's).  So, go to Luke Wholey's soon!  You won't regret it!",

YUMMY!!! i would say they need just a few more wine choices, red since that's what we drink! (haha!) what they had was good, but a  few more would be nice.  the atmosphere is kitschy & loud, but, it is so worth going to, you don't mind so much! put on your stretchy pants & be prepared to eat amazing food!",

    "text": "We made reservations to come here for brunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Looking on their website (Which was down for maintenance) and on the Yelp site we couldn't find any brunch menus.  Only lunch.  We just figured they probably have a brunch menu special that changes week to week.     We parked at a lot nearby and walked in.  Our table was ready and it was busy in there.  There was a festival going on near by so a lot of people were around in the Strip.  We sat down and our waitress gave us their menus and she went over verbally their brunch menu for the day.  I was almost set with going with one of their fish sandwiches but she described a French toast with ice cream that seemed delicious but just too sweet for me at this time of the day.  The other option I liked was Chorizo tacos and I added a side of fries because I was hungry.  My wife was in between a few choices too like their Lobster Roll or the Salmon scrambled eggs. She went with the Salmon.  She did order a Bloody Mary to go with her brunch too.  I just had water.   Our food came out within 15 minutes and it all looked good.  My tacos were really tasty.  I received 2 tacos and I could have eaten three.  That's why I ordered a side of fries.  The fries were disappointing.  I know this is a fish place but I still expected decent fries.  My fries were not seasoned, they just came out plain and they were $4.  I didn't like that.  I put S&P on them to make them better but they weren't worth $4.  My wife liked her Salmon and eggs. I think she really would have preferred the Lobster Roll but she let me eat some of her eggs and they were really good.  I actually liked it better than my tacos.   We liked this place and would visit here again to try out their lunch and entree menu's.  The atmospheres good and the people were friendly.  My only complaint was those $4 plain fries!",

    "text": "For Christmas every year my girlfriend is blessed by old Saint Nick with a slew of gift cards to local businesses usually near work or home. This year was exciting because we got $50 towards a visit at Luke Wholey's Grille. Obviously, we knew it would be different than the fish market, but curious to see how tasty things might be!   We made our way down the Strip around lunch time so we were fairly hunger and ready to enjoy some free grub. Being that we had a gift card, it was a must to get an appetizer! Ball out a little, we thought! Decided on crab cakes, which were damn there perfect. The worst thing that can happen to a crab cake is too much oil, these were fried just right and there was fluffy crab meat all throughout. After that good treat, we were greeted by who I believe to be the owner, with our entrees.   My GF got the Ahi tuna sandwich with a side of fries and I went with the Steel City lobster roll, also with a side of fries. We were both impressed with our meals! The amount of lobster that was on the roll was a pleasant surprise and my goodness how delicious and buttery it was. Me being me, I had to try a bite of my GF's tuna which was grilled nicely on the outside and just right in the middle.   A great experience we had at Luke Wholey's and we do plan on returning sooner then later. Excited to try the dinner menu options and apps!",

    "text": "After getting gift cards for Luke Wholey's for Christmas, my boyfriend and I decided to save them for when the weather is nicer. Finally, the time has come that we've gotten nice, enjoyable weather and we decided to cash in on our gift cards. It's ok to go here when the weather is not so favorable, but I love feeling the breeze flow through a restaurant while eating, and it's nice to have the option to sit outside!  We split the crab cake appetizer (2 small crab cakes), and it was the perfect portion size for the two of us. The sauce that came with it for dipping was their Cajun aioli, and let me tell you as the self-proclaimed Condiment Queen that this is one of my favorite house-made sauces that I've tasted. I ordered the blackened ahi tuna sandwich cooked rare, the only respectable way to eat blackened ahi tuna. The sandwich came with the Cajun aioli and a generous portion of well-seasoned fries. Ahi tuna has a wonderful, fresh yet almost steak-like feel to it. Cooking it too long causes it to dry out and lose some of the lovely flavor and moisture it naturally has. It was grilled to perfection for the short time that it was on the grill, and that deep reddish color in the middle was mouth-watering.  My boyfriend got the Steel City Lobster Roll. He loves getting things that I don't cook at home when we go out, and I most certainly don't cook lobster at home. His sandwich came with huge, beautiful buttery chunks of lobster on it, and there was a good amount of Luke Wholey's lobster bisque on top. It was a work of art. If you don't like lobster, this sandwich may just convert you. When the waiter brought us our food he told us the restaurant was very proud of the Steel City Lobster Roll, and it isn't hard to tell why! Personally, lobster isn't my absolute favorite seafood as it can be a little sweet for my liking, but the lobster bisque balanced it out well. My boyfriend asked for a cup of the Cajun aioli on the side, and it was just as tasty on my sandwich as it was on the fries!  Overall, I felt like the pricing was fair at Luke Wholey's for the freshness of the food and the portion size. Fresh seafood can get pricey, and if you view the menu you will notice a slight jump in prices between lunch and dinner. The portion size and dishes differ at dinner, but since I was here for lunch our bill for 2 sandwiches and an appetizer was a fair $45.   Trying one of Luke Wholey's Bloody Marys and some sushi is on my list for next time. The service was friendly and quick, prices were okay, and the food was fantastic. I can't really think of anything that would've made our experience better, so we will definitely be looking forward to our next visit. Definitely worth stopping here if you're in the Strip!",

The entrees arrived, with the exception of mine; mahi mahi tacos. The server apologized stating that they were making the corn salsa because they were all out. Least mine would be super fresh!

They were delightful, succulent tasty bites of DELICOUSNESS paired with a sweet Thai sauce that elevated the already tasty bites. The Lobster Bisque was creamy, and thick!!! With just the right amount of seasoning and wonderful Creme Fraiche on top. The Stuffed Maine Lobster was different and although I enjoyed some of it I was a little put off by the stuffing on top. I didn't really taste the Jumbo and Lump shrimp mixed in with Asiago Cream sauce (?). The Lobster fries were good and the Blackened King Salmon!...... Deliciousness!!!!!!! The Bourbon Glaze made that Salmon worthy of a place on their menu for sure!!!! I almost stole my husband's dinner!To end our night on a sweetheart note, we had the oh so sweet Blood Orange Cheesecake and the Up All Night chocolate cake. Both were really tantalizingly good!!!! This Philly Foodie will make it back to try more good eats from Luke Wholey's!",

Was totally surprised by how quickly our appetizers and entrees came out. Started with the lobster bisque fries which were pretty good, it was a big portion. The sushi someone else ordered looked great too. I had the crab stuffed salmon. The glaze on the salmon was excellent as was the kale. The potatoes were good too though a little soggy. Prices of things are reasonable, maybe a little high. Overall, really liked this place and will definitely be back.",

My boy was attracted by the fact they serve sushi (11 year old aficionado), so he selected a tuna roll as well as the salmon with sweet soy for his entre, while I picked some blackened shrimp. The server was very attentive and solicitous throughout the meal, even as others arrived to eat. When the food came, the boy was very happy with the sushi (\"This is terrific! Try a piece!\"); he really enjoyed his salmon as well. My shrimp was very tasty, and we both enjoyed the jasmine rice and steamed broccoli; the sweet soy feathered across the plates made for a wonderful presentation. I think the lad has a new favorite seafood restaurant, and I'll give him no guff when he wants to return. Terrific food and service, in a venue with decor that, for the kiddo, brought a chuckling Sponge Bob reference to mind. Great place to eat! Well done!",

I went with the large group and we surprisingly didn't have to wait for a table on a weekend afternoon. Really like how they have huge circle tables for large groups. However, it took us three hours to finish the meal. Every part of the meal was slow - taking our orders, checks, etc. Our waitress forgot to put in our order, but was nice about it and gave us a free round of drinks.   Anyways, I ordered a Blood Mary to start, its highlight is that it's served with two plump shrimp! For my main, I ordered the crab cake sandwich and loved it. Perfect ratio of ingredients, with more crab flavor than breadcrumbs/filling. I'm a HUGE seafood fan, so the food and ambiance are worth a return trip, but I'll be wary if I have time constraints.",

Why shouldn't you eat this? Why aren't you eating this right now? You deserve this. Go eat this. Seriously. I've tried bites of their other offerings, and they're great too. Drinks are good. Staff is always nice. On a reasonable day, they lift up the doors and you get a nice breeze and watch the people walk by with their Penn Mac bags, and discount produce. Parking is always awful, but this is a destination restaurant. That Lobster roll is a landmark.",

    "text": "Astonishing this place could have gotten four stars. The welcome as I walked in the door was nonexistent, and the service at best indifferent. The lobster had some rubbery things floating in it. The soup was a darkish brown and had a certain flavor unrelated to lobster. The rice in the California Roll was overlooked and nothing else in the roll had any flavor. So the whole thing was a mouthful of mush. My general impression was of a place that makes money off tourists and so doesn't try very hard for the quality and consistency required to create a noteworthy local restaurant with a loyal clientele",

Staff is always very friendly and helpful, place is clean and I love the outdoor seasonal seating.     Went for a late lunch, as I always do and ordered crab cake app., it was 95% crab meat with a tiny bit of binder to hold it together, super good.  Their shrimp is always HUGE and weather I get it cooked or cocktail it tastes amazingly fresh.  They have a $12-13 lunch special menu which we ordered the Ahi Tuna with wasabi sauce; another hit.  I got a few raw oysters ... because I just can not pass up their yummy brineyness-as always.  Downed a crisp shrimp Caesar salad with a flavorful anchovy dressing.    Aside from their totally rocking bloody marys, today we ordered a Paloma; a very refreshing grapefruit/lime/tequila drink.  I like it better than a Margarita, just make sure you get it with WHITE tequila (Blanco) it is MUCH better, I promise you that.    The only issue I have with Luke Wholey's is the food is so delicious, I want to try everything so...... When we go for lunch, our bill with tip is usually around $80.00.  I am not saying they are overpriced, just so darn good that we order many plates to share and ...well.... it adds up fast.  That being said, at other establishments, I have had awful food and terrible services and paid the same.  I Do NOT mind dropping a few on awesome food and service.  We will be back Luke Wholeys !!!  Sure will.",

They are probably the best bloody Mary's I've had in Pittsburgh.  I tried to bring my family there during a busy time. We would have totally understood a busy situation. We were looking to get drinks. It didn't matter where we were, we just wanted drinks and we made it clear to the hostess that we only wanted drinks but we were willing to wait. She told us that there wasn't any availability, we waited to see if she had any other situations. She did not. She didn't look at us like it was our cue to leave. In my opinion, I thought she was an idiot.  It irritated me that she handled a \"hard to handle\" situation the way that she did.",

With that said, the food was incredibly fresh and everything was seasoned perfectly. The outdoor dining set up with the removable back wall was in place and made for a lovely little afternoon snack. Definitely a must try if you're in the mood for good fish while in Pittsburgh.",

I tried their lobster bisque fries and it was delicious. Big, plump lobster pieces and gravy on top of fries make this dish a great choice for appetizer  I had the salmon and tuna lunch meal. Both of the fishes are very fresh and cooked to the right rareness. They are tender and melt in your mouth. I recommend ordering the fish with sweet soy seasoning. This sauce complement the fish very well. The portion is also big so the dishes will definitely fill you up.   For beverages, their selection is pretty standard and typical. A bit of everything for everyone. They do have some local draft beer but unfortunately, i couldn't try it because some options were run out.   Service is a little bit slow but the staffs are friendly and they do try their best to serve you.",

The bisque was not as salty as others I tasted in other restaurants, instead they had a very salty bread to mix the flavor. They clearly designed the sauce for the stuffed salmon carefully. However, it made the salmon taste like fried ribbonfish? I was disappointed by this. The kale was good though. That is my favourite among these two dishes. It is sweet and buttery. Not bitter tastes at all.  However, the crusted ahi tuna was definitely a 5 star dish. With the right amount of caviar and wasabi, the lighted baked tuna had a special texture and taste. The  fried asparagus was also a suprise. It was like eating tempura but with veggie inside. Totally worth the 30 bucks.  In summary, good place. Generally I like the eating experience here. But some dishes may not worth the money.",

I've been making buffalo sauce for years and haven't been able to get it to taste this good, perhaps the secret ingredient is mayo or thick butter.  I got the idea to order the soft-shelled crab Bloody Mary from a fellow Yelper (thanks!) and noticed after it came to my table everyone around me started ordering the same thing. Other than being crazy and unique it was the best Blood Mary I've ever had. We'll be coming back here next time we visit Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "This is a solid seafood place. Their seafood is fresh. My family and I went as a celebration of my brother being in town and seafood is usually the best neutral cuisine for us. I was quite impressed with the taste of everything but the four stars and not five is because of the service.   Let me start with the food. We ordered 3 appetizers as there were 6 of us: one dozen oysters (east & west coast), calamari, and mussels. Each dish was fantastic. I could've eaten the oysters by myself. I didn't want to stop. I'm sad I only got 3 of them. They were extremely fresh and you could tell the difference in taste for either region. The calamari was fried but the breading was light and the calamari itself was not chewy at all - just as calamari should be. Lastly, the mussels were yummy! The light wine sauce it came in and the freshness of the mussels was such a great combo, even down to the bread, it was tasty. We really loved our apps. My gram got the lobster bisque and she said it was the best she ever had.   Next, our entrees. I ended up with the grilled swordfish. My whole dish was so lovely. However, I asked to sub my potatoes with a salad and apparently our waiter or the cook staff didn't do that and I got potatoes and my salad but no asparagus. I had to ask for it and I'm glad I did because they were out of this world. I've never had asparagus that good! On top of my swordfish was lump crab and they give you plenty. It was really just super flavorful and I really enjoyed it. It seemed like everyone enjoyed their dishes except my brother who thought the salmon dish was a bit bland, especially the kale. It's not a lot of food with that dish. But my other brother loved his seafood pasta and so did my dad. My mom also loved the cod and my gram loved her crab cakes.   I also got a dessert because my brother mentioned it was my birthday (which it is soon lol) and we ordered the flourless chocolate tort cake and it was great! Not too sweet and pretty tasty.   Ok. So the service. When we arrived, we were a little early for our reservation but they sat us anyway. The people that worked there did not seem friendly at all. At one point one of the waiters needed to come by us and he would've knocked us all over if they didn't move out of the way. He didn't even say excuse me or acknowledge us at all. After we were sat we had to wait at least 15 minutes before our waiter even came to get our drink orders. Although he was really nice, he was pretty slow and it wasn't even busy until we got our main dishes. He forgot a lot of things we needed, too. But it is what it is. Still great food, regardless!",

    "text": "Oh Luke Wholey's, what a great place for seafood. I have been for crab fest and I can say it is well worth it. We split the Alaskan King crab legs and the price was just right. They were also delectable, juicy and overall amazing. I would highly recommend them. My one issue though was when we were there, we ordered some sushi as well. It took a very long time and our server was apologetic about that. He kept updating us that it was coming and the sushi chef was backed up with orders. We were patient and finally got it but it was sub par. I don't think I would order it again, but it may be better on a night they aren't busy.  During my second time at Luke Wholey's, I ordered the crusted ahi tuna and wow, what a delicious dish. The tuna was fantastic and tempura crusted asparagus was interesting, but tasty. I also loved the mashed potatoes, but who doesn't love mashed potatoes??? The blood mary's are to die for as well, you can add bacon and shrimp to them which is amazing. Highly recommend ordering one if you are into that cocktail!  Overall, much love for Luke Wholey's and worth a visit.",

Service was good when we got it, but honestly we were kind of ignored for most of the meal. Our waiter was friendly though, just a tad absent.  I have to recommend the lobster fries. They were delicious, the lobster was tender and juicy and the gravy/lobster bisque was a perfect addition to the fries. They were a perfect rendition of poutine for this Canadian girl! My husband went with a steak entree from the special V-Day menu and I decided to have sushi. I ordered the yum yum roll. I was considering ordering another smaller roll too, but the yum yum was 10 very large pieces and I ended up bringing 4 home with me. The roll should have stayed in the fryer longer, it was not done as much as it should have been. The same could be said for the onion straws topping my husbands steak. Brown food=flavor people! Smh. Anyways. The roll was good, nice amount of spice. The Flourless chocolate cake with the espresso mousse was also a highlight of the meal. All in all it was good, wasn't spectacular, but it is worth going back again I want to try the brunch one weekend, looking forward to the soft shelled crab bloody mary. That looks fantastic!",

I know that this may sound cliche but everything was 5 star, top notch. The atmosphere was nothing short of perfect, from the nautical decor to the flowing layout, the restaurant matches the name to a T!  We walked in shortly before noon on a Sunday and were pleased to find a cozy high top on the bar side. The server greeted us immediately and informed us of the daily specials and the menu was absolutely amazing. We got a spicy tuna roll and exclusive crabstick sashimi. Both of which were full of flavor and versatility. I recommend the blackened catfish sandwich or the Baja shrimp po'boy, you will not be disappointed.  This place is normally full on a weeknight or weekend so I suggest making a reservation. Get here now don't wait another minute.",

Ever since we first tried this place, we always order the Over 9000 roll. Not just because it's REALLY FUN TO SAY. One of us ordered it that first visit, and now we can't stop in without getting it.  Also noteworthy: The Shrimp Po Boy is a great comfort food option. Generously shrimped (I know that's not a real verb, nonetheless) and perfectly piled up with fresh toppings. Same goes for the Lobster Bisque Fries: Comfort Food for your inner Beach Bum. Any seafood you get here is delightfully fresh tasting and so perfect in texture... They always just blow the preparation out of the water! (Ha)  Definitely a great go-to for a trip to the Strip!",

Yes, that's Luke's dad on a lobster phone (though experiencing the real deal in person is even more interesting).    The sushi there is excellent.  The individual pieces may be slightly smaller than the Slippery Mermaid's, but the quality is second to none.  The fish is fresh, tasty, and high quality - and for a very reasonable price.    Lobster bisque fries are similar to gravy fries but with lobster chunks, and if you splurge the extra dollar (and why wouldn't you), bacon bits.    Catfish bites are excellent - and ask for sriracha to add to the dipping sauce to make it the way they originally came when he first opened.  Definitely awesome & spicy.  Mahi Mahi tacos are another excellent appetizer.    As for the cocktails - good gravy in the navy!  The ginger mule is excellent.  So is the Snozzberry.    That said - the Bloody Mary is hands down the best drink available here - and possibly the best Bloody Mary I've had in Pittsburgh.  Spend the $3 and add the candied bacon.  It's absolutely, positively worth it.  You have to have this Bloody Mary.  That's all there is to it.  If for no other reason, go there and have this Bloody Mary.  Seriously.",

I had the surf and turf along with the lobster bisque (massive pieces of lobster) and it was by FAR the best I've had in the city to date!! I also had their twist on an old fashion that was mixed up by an extremely friendly/pleasant bartender Ryan.....again....amazing.....even better than my previous favorite at Butcher and the Rye. He also made a really great gin martini of some sort for my wife that she raved about.  Can't wait to come back!!  P.S. Was blown away that they were able to fit us in at 6:30 on a Saturday night, the restaurant was very busy but it's a big enough space that there were still a few available tables, so definitely keep this place in mind if you're in town to see a show or other event on the weekend! Everyone from the hostess I spoke to when making the reservation, to  our waiter Brian (super funny), and as previously mentioned, their bartender were soooo welcoming! The only other restaurant that I've had that vibe from is the Hartwood Restaurant in Fox Chapel.  A++++",

Dont know what to call them but they look neat. They have a large bar, with flat screens showing the game and on the opposite side large painting of different animal: grizzly bear, fish, birds etc. Has a cool industrial meets vintage feel so I was lovely it.   So...the food...first of we started with a ginormous root beer float just cuz and I got blue piont oysters as an appetizer.  Wow, they were fresh,  salty and not one speck of sand. For dinner I got the Mexican Shrimp Volcano that had a lobster claw, a large portion (maybe 6 or 8) of jumbo Tiger shrimp, at least 6 big sprigs of grilled asparagus all strategically placed on very yummy mashed potatoes. It was very good, hearty and had a lot of different elements that blended well together.    The bright  star of the dinner though was the Lobster Mac and Cheese...holy cow this was amazing.  I know because my husband made the mistake of giving me a bite and I of course had to have more (thank God for the large portion they give you).  The pasta,  cheese sauce...wow the cheese sauce was so good I am getting hungry just thinking about it. Not only were the bare bones of the dish hands down great but there was a surprising amount of lobster in it. My husband had to continuously get his knife so he could cut the large portions of lobster he was finding... not common for most places who attempt this dish. The Lobster Mac and Cheese here by far is one of the top favorite dishes I have ever eaten - absolutely spectacular.    The whole experience was such a treat - this restaurant has it all. Great decor, awesome food, helpful staff  and our server Davin knew all the ins and outs of the menu. We even got to chat a bit with Luke himself and were surprised to find out he used to be a street foods vendor.  Pretty cool.   Again going down to this restaurant was a complete treat. We felt welcome from beginning to end and we will definitely be back. Highly recommended this establishment and if you want great service ask for Davin.",

It's a bit pricey but the rainbow roll that I got was outstanding. I also got a free appetizer by checking in on my phone with my Yelp App. I elected for the lobster bisque for the appetizer. It was very thick with plenty of chunks of lobster meat in most spoonfuls. Simply delicious.  Although I can only recommend the sushi for now, I'd like to stop in and try some of their other seafood dishes. From what I saw on other peoples plates, the meals look superb.",

    "text": "So Jillian and I are reviewing it's amazing restaurant right on the strip district in Pittsburgh - Luke Wholeys Wild Alaskan Grill.  We talked it over and decided this was one of the best meals we've had stateside - outstanding!!   We started off sharing a sushi roll with my sister from another mister, Kristen Hancock, her husband Luke and their little boy Wyatt - a roll they call the Kitchen Sink.  Yellowtail, spicy tuna, salmon and tuna - and it was fantastic!!    After that we all went into our zones and that's when amazing went into overdrive!   Jillian had the ahi tuna, seared and topped with two kinds of tobego - one infused with lemon reduction that had her inhaling it. SHE LOVED IT!!!!!  KRISTEN did the soft shell crab sandwich and Luke the shrimp Po-boy and everyone had smiles around the table a mile wide.    Im looking around checking out what the other tables were having - and the waiter made the decision easier for me:  I first decided to go with their Bloody Mary topped with spicy shrimp and maple bacon. It was so amazing I can barely type the rest of this review as my knees got totally week.  All of the olives, pickles and have of the maple bacon went to my co-reviewer -).   After that I moved right onto the lobster bisque that was truly one of the best I ever had. Chunks of lobster creme fraiche perfectly mixed together into a fantastic warm soup on a beautiful spring afternoon.  But I wasn't done there.  Oh no, because on their menu they offer something called the steel city lobster roll - which is essentially an amazing lobster roll topped with their incredible lobster bisque as a bit of a gravy. So good, so good, so good!!!  The service was fantastic, they even took care of my pups with water under the table and we all had a spectacular spectacular lunch!  Id fly back to Pittsburgh food just to eat their food.  We really enjoyed spending time with Luke himself the owner who returns out at one time lived on 89th and fifth - just a few blocks away from me in NYC  Bravo!!!",

    "text": "Let me tell you friends, I've been on a MASSIVE seafood kick lately!  It's not just sushi though, it's everything and I want it well prepared and cooked to perfection.  So you walk into a place with the name \"Wholey\" and you expect it to \"wow\" you.  And you know what?  It did!  I was surprised to see the less than stellar reviews at first, but I had faith it was just the new restaurant jitters.  We came in on a random Tuesday night around 8pm and was surprised to see about 6 other tables full with diners.  Surprising to see in the Strip, but exciting, if you ask me!    It's an absolutely gorgeous space.  Nothing you would expect from the Strip at this point and time.  It actually used to be a club, so there's many different levels.  I love the sea of blues and mosaic tiles.  The tables are large, so it's great for big parties.    We started out with the Sashimi appetizer and it was so cold and fresh.  I loved the tiny mandarin oranges and crisp lettuce surrounding it.  We devoured it within 3 seconds of it hitting the table.  Good start!  The tomato salad will probably only be on the menu for a short time, considering the season for them ends soon, but it's worth having when you can.  You can easily throw together some tomatoes and splash on some balsamic.  This had a very well done pesto sauce and pine nuts.  I would have never thought of the combo together, but I loved it!    I ordered the Scallops and Shrimp, which came with a hearty helping of jasmine rice and grilled bok choy.  Both the Scallops and Shrimp were seared to perfection and the scallops, which I find hard to season well, had a great flavor and were large in size.  I loved the creamy garlic sauce drizzled on top.  It was as if every element of the dish came together in harmony!    While seafood can be expensive, and this was no exception for a $24 meal, I had no qualms about paying my bill for the amount of flavor that was packed into each dish.  Fresh is the word here and you won't have to reel me in... I'm coming on my own!",

    "text": "I'm really not sure where to start on this review because everything was absolutely phenomenal. I could not have asked for a better server or better food which if you knew me says a lot considering my older brother is a professional chef who has won several championships in the state of Maryland and I've been a bit spoiled by his cooking.  Let's get started. The date was Saturday February 18th - we brought some sunny beautiful 60-65 degree weather to Pittsburgh  My aunt made reservations for us since it would be a larger party at 6pm.  It was my aunt and uncle, my favorite cousin's girlfriend and her mom, husband and I and our two kids. When we arrived, we were seated immediately. Our server Brian came over right away and got our drink order. He was fabulous! First off, our son is autistic and he was absolutely amazing with him. He could've very easily blown my son off while we were there and not answered  our son's 50-60 questions about what type of cellphone do you have and why you should have an iPhone like his parents do. We all decided that we would share some appetizers. We ordered calamari, Thai chili catfish bites, wild Alaskan roll off of the sushi menu and I also got an order of seaweed salad for myself.  My family all ordered the fish and chips, the crab stuffed salmon, the imperial swordfish, the Alaskan crab legs, my aunt ordered the Baja shrimp puttanesca pasta, the Baja shrimp and Day boat scallops, the colossal blue crab salad and it was absolutely amazing - all of it. Luke came out and checked on us. He was genuine, he talked to both of the kids, our daughter told him how her and our son caught a huge rockfish off the pier back home and showed him the picture(he thought it was awesome), Luke thanked us for coming in and told us to call him at the restaurant next time we were in town.  I know this is long, my insincere apologies lol but this place is so worth it! So if y'all have",

Since our three visits, we managed to meet both Robert Wholey and his son who always graciously thank us for our patronage really creating a great atmosphere.  The community element needs to come back to every restaurant!  We came this time exclusively for sushi.  The final verdict is that nothing beats the Utsukushi Roll.  We came here to try other rolls for comparison, but nothing seems to compete.  While most of the food won't disappoint, there are True winners and gems at Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille.   Kevin was an especially great waiter.  \"in heaven with Kevin\" as he would say.  Super attentive and friendly albeit mistaken about the Yum Yum roll tasting better than the Utsukushi.",

I had the crab stuffed salmon and my husband had the shrimp and scallops. Both were amazing and very filling! We also had small salads to start and I have to say that the lemon ginger dressing g was the best dressing I have ever eaten. They seriously need to bottle that up and sell it because I would buy a case!!! The only thing that I would say that was not perfect was the fact that I didn't know they served sushi. I'm not sure if you have to ask for that menu because we didn't get to look at it. I only knew because the table beside us got some. I would have definitely ordered that as an appetizer if I had known. Looking forward to going back and trying the lobster bisque fries... Who ever thought of that must be a genius because they sound amazing!!!",

    "text": "My most recent visit here was to celebrate V Day. I was given a choice of my favorite restaurant and this is it.  Reservations were made for 8pm and we were seated in a good spot to catch action on the TV while we talked and ate. Our server was the same gal that served for my bday party. Her name slips my mind but she's really sweet. She ran through the specials and then left us to decide. I chose the baja shrimp and day boat scallops which is served with rice, asparagus and choice of sauce. I chose the lobster buerre crack, ummm I mean blanc. Lol it's very good.  The scallops and shrimp were cooked perfectly!!! The rice was a great accompaniment and the asparagus had a yummy char on it.  My valentine had the stuffed salmon. He really enjoyed his meal as well as 1 of the shrimp I was willing to part with. Unlike the seafood chains, the food is seasoned well here and not overly salted. The meals are very filling so there wasn't room for dessert but whatever dessert they were flaming by the bar looked really good.  I've been to many seafood restaurants around here as well as ocean front spots and this place is above average. From the apps to the sushi to the entrees....you can't go wrong with the fresh fish and creativity that's served up here.",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to this place and while my meal was okay, I'll explain why I am only giving this 2 stars.   When I first walked in I noticed that it was smokey, and it stayed smokey the entire time I was there. It was really distracting.   Next comes the service. While our server was friendly, the time that it took for our drinks to come out was ridiculous. And it wasn't all that crowded there, plus we had made reservations so it's not like we just stopped in. We ordered appetizers at the same time as our drinks and those took even longer to come out. And then when they did come out, our meals came out less than 10 min later. So we were still eating the apps, there wasn't enough room on the table for everything. We consolidated the plates on our own big they never came and picked up the dirty plates. And speaking of the table, the actual height of the table was way too high for the chairs. I felt like a little kid eating at the adult table.   Lastly, we told our server we had a coupon from Yelp for a free appetizer. I had checked in and had 4 hours to use the coupon. I showed her my phone and she clicked redeem now and then immediately clicked the mark as used button. So she didn't get the code or whatever she needed for the free app. I tried to explain that I couldn't check back in (because Yelp won't let you within a certain time period) but she didn't know what she was doing and I just said forget about the coupon.   As for my meal, I had the sea bass which was a special. It was very tasty but others in my party did not like their meals. And I tried everyone else's, they were just okay.   Also, while I did not go to the restroom, others in my party did and said it was dirty and there were no paper towels.   I am a pretty generous reviewer. It really takes a lot for me to have a poor experience but this was really just disappointing.",

The seafood pasta entree (i think the most expensive on the menu) was awesome! They overflowed the plate with all kinds of different seafood and didn't go too heavy on the noodles. The blackened shrimp and scallops were just ok. The sauce on the rice was too sweet for my taste.   Service - I think the host might be Luke himself. He was very accommodating and checked in on us a few times. Our server was very friendly. I kept ordering beer that they were out of so they gave me a bunch of tasters. The bartender actually came to the table to better understand my beer taste so he can recommend the right beer for me.  I would definitely go back but will probably just stick to the seafood pasta. They say it's for 1 person but it's really large enough for 2. Maybe get an appetizer and the pasta to share for 2 people.",

No problem getting quickly seated and served, but it kind of bums you out when you're informed it's your last chance to get a drink before your entree has even arrived. They have to figure a better way to operate so that late arriving customers aren't shortchanged on the experience and offerings. Perhaps have drinks available for seated guests only? Keep the bar open an hour later? I don't know, but figure something out. Aside from that, the place was decent. I went with a Caesar salad and the hot pepper encrusted tuna. Both were fresh and tasty, and portions appropriate. The prices were just a tad high but despite all of this, I think I'd give them another shot when in town.",

The halibut could have been lovely if not for being dry as a bone with bland flavoring and no sauce that could have helped the dryness. My salmon was just bad and sad  the crab on top was actually ok but the sauce was an odd mix of mismatched flavors and the salmon was so over cooked it could have been served as a hockey puck!!

You could tell the staff was well trained as everyone we encountered was polite and welcoming.   The food was reasonably priced for fresh seafood and the oysters were delicious.  Our waitress suggested three types based on my preferences and she nailed them.  We are already planning our next visit; there were too many tempting options on the menu to try in one visit.  Another perk, they now have a reward card which after one visit already got us halfway to a $20 credit.   As we left, the gentleman at the door shook our hands and asked us to be safe on the snowy roads.  We will certainly be back.   I only wish we lived a tiny bit closer so we could visit more often.",

Fellow patrons were an ecclectic lot - we were jeans casual, neighbors to the right were full out-on-the-town diamonds and pearls and to the left were a family of cyclists... complete with Papa wearing silver racing shorts.  Two take aways:  Scallop envy can be fixed.  Bicycle shorts should only come in black.",

We also had the lunch special Sockeye salmon (my husband had it blackened and I had the sweet soy) and we both loved it. The salmon was cooked to perfection. Our server, Brett, was super nice and personable and we had a great time! We will definitely be going back for dinner soon!",

    "text": "We have been in going to the strip for most of the last decade after relocating to Pittsburgh.  We enjoyed many food haunts over the years and eyed with a little skepticism Luke's new restaurant when it opened a few years ago.  The fish wholesalers taking a gamble at a restaurant?  We gave it a shot and loved it...6 visits ago!  Our latest visit was this past Saturday.  We returned hoping to find the upscale casual comfort we found before and were served that from the moment we walked in the door.  The staff made us feel very welcome with witty banter and quick service.  The whole restaurant smacked of enjoyment as we witnessed most tables full of folks enjoying beers, wine and some of their meal in a glass bloody marys.  Mind you, this was only 12:30pm!  This place has a way of making you want to enjoy MORE.  We went with iced tea and sodas as we had our daughters in tow.  Sweet tea was not on the menu but our excellent server Brian took the unsweet and delivered it with a little simple sugar to my wife to make it so.  The bisque was excellent and paired well with a side salad with lemon vinaigrette.  Enough of that starter stuff... The crab cake was very good.  If you know what a good one is supposed to be like, I don't need to explain further. In fact, I wont.  We also enjoyed the salmon club special along with our daughter ordering her regular favorite, the shrimp po'boy buffalo style and the other a salmon club special.   Note:  when ordering avocado, you get most of an avocado. Yep.  Something finally worth the up-charge in the restaurant world.  Look, the food was very enjoyable. The only thing better was the service.  Excellent and unimposing service.  While it has been a few months since we have been here, our last trip will make this destination a certain stop on our Strip District railway journey again sometime soon!  Well done Luke and the team!",

If you are looking for the best, do yourself a favor go here and enjoy the experience that only Luke Wholey can provide for a wonderful dinner and an incredibly enjoyable epicurean seafood experience. Once you arrive Jerry will take care of you and entertain you while waiting for your server. If you need something special tell Jerry and he will do his best to take care of it for you. Shelby and the rest of the wait staff are awesome in their knowledge of how the various fish dishes are prepared are a great asset to those who might not be familiar with some of the preparations. Best of all if you are an oyster fan get ready to have your mind blown with the best, freshest, and most delicious oysters you'll ever eat.   Can't say enough about how well they treat you and the food is second to none. Luke's attention to details and his pride in what he sends out to the customers is evident and it comes though in every delicious bite you take. Take my word on this you will not leave hungry. I won't reccomend any one dish but I will say that every time I have been there each dish that has been prepared was as good as the other one's we all shared. From the seafood trio, to the various specials Luke offers, you honeslty will not find anything that is not exceptional.   Favorite restaurant in town, incredible drinks (Pineapple Upside Down is silly good), and the cheese cakes they have blow your mind. Can't wait to go back again and again and again.......",

    "text": "This place is pretty close to a 5 for me because they tried so hard to make it a great experience for me, but some things just didn't fall into place.  To preface this, I was with a party of 10 for an engagement dinner party type of thing and decided on going to this restaurant because I hadn't tried it before and they were willing to accommodate for a large party on short notice.  The interior space has a good feel since its an open space with wide open seating and an extra cozier bar area upstairs which is where we were seated. That was a nice touch that they made it private but, the heat was turned up and it very hard to bear. We asked for them about it and they tried to turn the heat down and also bring a couple fans upstairs. They're going to need to look to fix this problem if they want to actually use this bar area in the winter.  We ordered 3 appetizers: Crab cakes, calamari and garlic sauteed shrimp they were all pretty standard and yummy but a big bonus was when Luke Wholey brought out a seared ahi tuna platter on the house that was delicious. We all had various entrees and sides but some highlights include the Lobster Bisque, the Maple Whiskey Glazed Shrimp/Scallops and the Blue Crab stuffed Salmon. Everything tasted delicious and would've been a meal worthy of a 5.  However there were some logistical issues that they need to figure out. After we ordered, we waited probably 30-40 min for all the food to come out. That wasn't that unreasonable since we had 10 people, but what wasn't so great was that they somehow dropped 2 orders so those came closer to 50 min and 2 of the orders weren't completely correct. They made up for it by comping both late entrees and after someone in the party let them know it was an engagement party we also had a champagne toast on the house.  All in all, I enjoyed the food very much and as a fan of seafood you should definitely come. I think this place will be a successful restaurant to come as it gets more experienced with dealing with different situations such as big groups.",

    "text": "Wow wow wow-y. Their oysters are to die for!   Now that you know that, I shall put up a proper review. My boyfriend and I were taking a much needed shopping trip to the Strip and we were starving. Outside of Kaya, I'm not sure that I've eaten at any other restaurant in the Strip until this place. One of my boyfriend's good friends (who works for Clique Vodka) helped with getting the place up and running yet this weekend was our first time dropping by.  We sat at the main bar (of course) closest to the sushi bar and started with our favorite weekend drink, mimosas. Our bartender was super cool, forget her name. We looked over the menus for probably forever and couldn't decide what the hell we wanted. My boyfriend said something about the buckets of oysters sitting near us and one of the employees, Eric, started telling us about where each came from and their taste and texture. Then Luke jumped in and showed us this super tiny little oyster and gave it to my boyfriend to try. He loved the taste of it, but unfortunately it was the last one! I forget where it was from.  Based on Luke and Eric's recommendations we ended up ordering 4 of 3 types of oysters. Plus, Eric threw in a \"bonus\" oyster for each of us! :D Also, check in if you do the Foursquare thing. You can get either 3 free oysters, 1 free appetizer, or 1 free Clique Vodka drink. We decided to do a free app and ordered the peel and eat shrimp. This girl was in her happy place.  The oysters were so delectable and the shrimp had a nice taste from the Old Bay seasoning. I have a love/hate relationship with Old Bay because most people like to drown their seafood in it.    We got to chat with Luke about starting up the restaurant, their first Friday sushi happy hour, and his trip with my bf's friend down to New Orleans for the Great Seafood Cookoff, or something like that (he was stationed next to a previous Iron Chef winner hehe). All in all it was a highly enjoyable experience, one we weren't even expecting. I loved it, and I know we'll be back, especially to try out the sushi.",

When my boyfriend and I walked into the restaurant it was aesthetically pleasing and the greeter and waiter was very pleasant. Being from New Orleans the first thing to catch our eyes was the Asian catfish...actually it wasn't the Asian part JUST A TASTE OF THE YUMMY FLAKY CATFISH!!!! We ordered it and there was no seasoning on the fish (this saddened me) but hey the dipping sauce helped. He (the boyfriend) then ordered a mixed drink, but it was like a play on hot chocolate and it actually tasted like a lemonade. Lol I think I liked it! My boyfriend didn't.   Lol then I had to order the lobster roll (this is what I came there for). So I ordered the hot one with the gravy over it and guess what?????? I DIDN'T LIKE THE LOBSTER ROLL!!!! BUT I LOOOOOOOVED THE GRAVY WITH MY FRENCH FRIES!!!!!  2 STARS FOR THIS PLACE BUT ONLY FOR THE GOOD ASS GRAY!!!!  YUMMYLICIOUS!!!",

    "text": "Fab-u-lous!  Seriously, from the appetizers to the chocolate covered strawberries that we were given for dessert on Valentine's day - free - it was spectacular.    My husband and I arrived around 530 on Valentine's day without reservations.  We had bought a half off deal on WPXI and were hoping to use it on Valentine's day, not thinking about reservations.  Sadly, they weren't needed as the place was only about half full by the time we left.  It should have been packed as this is one of the great seafood restaurants in town!  I gasped as I saw that they had oyster shooters.  While living in NYC, this was a staple of any good brunch, but after living here for 7 years, they are hard to find.  I immediately ordered one, but was a bit disappointed by the bloody mary mix.  It tasted more like marinara than bloody mary, but the oyster - oh, the oyster!  So delicious, I ordered two more oysters.  Sadly, they had run out of the type I wanted, so in a purely classy move, they gave me two others and then offered me two others to try.  Woo hoo for oysters!  For the main course, we decided to split two meals.  I ordered the seafood lovers pasta and J ordered the sockeye salmon stuffed with lump crab with smashed potatoes, red potatoes (he likes his starch) and asparagus.  OMG.  When the pasta came out, I was astounded by the amount of seafood in it - clams, mussels, gigantic shrimp, massive pieces of lobster claw meat, calamari, salmon.... I think that was it.  Oh, scallops!  Damn.  Awesome, awesome quality fish in a mildly spicy basil marinara.  It's refreshing to see seafood in a non-cream sauce and this was absolutely delicious.  J's salmon was cooked perfectly with heaps of lump crab meat.  The potatoes were all fantastic and while the asparagus was good, there were only like 6 thin sad little spears.  For $3.50 for chargrilled asparagus, I would like a bigger pile than the sad little spears we received.  They were really good though.    We decided to pass on dessert - they only had cheesecake.  However, when they brought the bill they also brought two of the most spectacular chocolate covered strawberries with a nice heaping of whipped cream.    We will definitely be back.  There are literally 10 other things on the menu that I wanted to try and their sandwiches sound delicious.   A great new find in the strip!",

My boyfriend also didn't eat his lobster mac and cheese and we aren't finicky eaters. However, sushi and crab cakes were amazing. Maybe their best chefs work on the weekends?? Advice: Just make your meals uniform no matter who is making them. Wait staff there is great. I may give them another try on a weekend night.",

    "text": "I'm going to have to pay Wild Alaskan Grille another visit to truly decide how I feel about it. We went there  on a  saturday (when it was mid 60s outside) so naturally the Strip was packed. We sat at the bar and the bartender quickly got our draft selections. They had a very good draft list by the way. Since it was lunch time the choices were not plentiful but we both ordered a cup of lobster bisque and my boyfriend ordered the cajun catfish bites. The catfish bites came out first. They were \"eh\" could have taken them or left them. Our soup was forgotten about. After we asked the bartender who did not take our order, we got the soup right away. The soup, now, was very good-it had plenty of lobster in it for the size of the cup and was very flavorful. The guys next to us at the bar ordered a large oyster platter which did look very good so I'd like to go back and try that. Now, our bill was $35. That was not the issue. The issue was that we asked to have it split in half and when we got our credit cards back each one had been run through for $26. Now $26+$26 is way more than $35. So I have no idea how he split it in half. When we pointed this out, he said \"I screwed that up huh?\", apologized, and corrected it. That bartender had great energy and you could tell he enjoyed what he was doing (or could at least act like it).I'd like to go back and try something else as their soup was promising but the catfish bites missed the mark.",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying I REALLY wanted to like this place. Isaac Holeva from Faded/premiere innovations is always raving about it and I'll say I appreciate his enthusiasm about good eats.   My fiance and I went this evening arriving about 15 minutes early for our 6:30 reservations (not needed place only had five tables sat) and were immediately a little put off. There were two girls behind the bar with a deer in headlights look... after a little deliberation between the two one decided she would seat us, but only after going to talk to one of her tables. So we waited awkwardly for several minutes before she came over to seat us. We choose our own table in the dining room, as apparently that was the norm, and aside from one hideous piece of art it was quite nice. High ceilings, murals of fish on the walls and some tables were actually accented with fish bowls.  After sitting for ten minutes without so much as a greeting, and without menus I might add(she claimed to have no idea where they were??), a waitress came to get our drink order. We ordered the Rodolfo Malbec ($40) and were finally allowed to see the menu offerings. The malbec was a little on the lighter bodied side for me but tasty nonetheless.  The waitress returned with our wine about 12 minutes later and poured both glasses without offering a taste or checking to see if it was even the right bottle. Aside from the obvious time dilemma, this is a clear sign of poor training/management. Regardless, we ordered. My fiance selected the lobster bisque to share with me and the shrimp and scallops with the lobster buerr blanc preparation. I chose the land and sea pairing of 6oz filet with three jumbo shrimp and a scallop served with smashed redskin potatos and charred asparagus.  Another 10 minutes went by before her soup finally arrived. The bisque appeared a little darker than I am accustomed to seeing them and I immediately suspected the rue was burnt. sure enough there was a bitter tone that muddled the flavor of this bisque which did sport some nice meaty chunks.  The food arrived about 15 minutes after the soup and I must say this was the highlight of the evening. Everything was cooked perfectly! The lemongrass on the steak was an excellent preparation and the shrimp and scallops were broiled to perfection. There was an obvious fresh quality to everything and I must note the shrimp especially was a little briney as if fresh out of the ocean. The scallops were the best thing on both of our plates!  We devoured everything and decided to stay for an after dinner drink. The cocktail selection offered several delicious sound cocktails and we opted for a lemon basil martini. It sounded so good but after waiting for literally 15 minutes while 3 people sat behind the bar doing nothing we decided to simply leave.  Overall I would rate the place 6.75 out of 10. The staff was awful and it seemed people appeared out of nowhere to stand around and do nothing. There was no apparent management figure, although I did see luke himself come to 2 tables to deliver food. They need a serious overall in the GM department. If not I would expect to see more 5 table nights and an early exit from what must be a high rent area.",

    "text": "What is going on here? Worst dining experience I've had in awhile. Where to begin? Daughter's birthday. She wanted crab legs. I looked through Yelp for the best in the 'Burg-when I came across Luke Wholey's & I immediately booked reservations for dinner. Hubby & I have been here so many times & loved it-We arrived on time-7:30 last Thursday night. Stood in the doorway for almost 15 minutes and NO ONE ever greeted us or acknowledged us at all. No one was hosting at the door. Finally brought to a table that needed to be cleaned off. Table was finally cleaned. We wait about 20 minutes for a waiter to come to our table. Drinks took about 25/30 minutes to get to the table. Meantime, we ordered she crab soup and lobster bisque. Took forever-It probably sat under the heat lamps 15-20 minutes, because when a food runner brought it to our table it had that skin on it that forms when it has sat under those warming lights too long. A soup that we had really wanted to be delicious was inedible. It was thick and lumpy, not hot & just gross. My swordfish was over cooked and also inedible. The glass of wine I ordered never came. The mashed potatoes with our entrees were cold. I took two bites of my entree, and although I did not complain, the waiter saw that I didn't eat my meal and offered to take half off the bill immediately...Like it happens all the time. I don't want half priced entrees for food I didn't eat-How about we just wanted good food & good service at a place we have been to many, many times. Not slow, spotty, aggravating, almost-absent service, subpar food, inedible-! What a lovely birthday celebration for my daughter. Everybody was tense, not having the good time we had hoped for. Very disappointed. I don't know what's going on here but it's not good. Really sorry to see this happen. This is not the Luke Wholey's we have enjoyed. The place I just experienced is certain not to be in business long, and that makes me sad. Too bad.",

After years of going to the strip district & eating at Roland's my boyfriend and I decided to check out Luke Wholey's for lunch instead a few years ago and were pleasantly surprised. Ever since then, I keep on coming back!   The atmosphere at Luke Wholey's looks like something that would be at the beach! It is the perfect fun seafood ambiance. In the Summer, they open the doors to sit outside on the sidewalk as well- which I love! I've also never had bad service while eating at Wholey's. I've been here on dates with my boyfriend, nights out with my girlfriends, and even brunch on Sunday with my parents and have always enjoyed myself!   Just about all of the food at Wholey's is fabulous. Some of my favorites include the lobster bisque fries (yes, a mound of French fries drizzled with lobster bisque), salmon, sushi, and ahi tuna. On my last visit, I tried the sushi for the first time after my friend raved about how amazing their sushi was. The waiter suggested the rainbow roll, so I gave that a try. It was super fresh and delicious. I also ordered a cup of the lobster bisque and a side Caesar salad. The lobster bisque is a little too rich for my liking- I prefer it over French fries more. I also love all of their specialty cocktails! I am not a bloody mary fan, but my boyfriend & dad love them from here! Luke Wholey's will always be a favorite spot in Pittsburgh for me.",

Tip - check in on Yelp and you can get a free appetizer with any menu item order. Since we had already eaten, we didn't really want appetizers, except maybe some oysters. The waiter was nice enough to let us use the Yelp offer as $12 off the bill. The oysters were tiny and not completely shucked clean - but hey at $12 off, how can I complain?",

    "text": "I have loved Luke's since the first time I set foot in the door back in 2013 [yea I was late to the game] so I am excited to finally review the place.  For all Pittsburghers the name Wholey is automatically associated with high quality Seafood, so Luke had some big shoes to fill when he opened it back in 2012. Nestled on the corner of 21st street the first thing that you come across is an inviting outdoor patio with a few tables and an outdoor oyster bar. Pick your favorites fresh on ice. The outdoor seating is actually a walk in by opening the garage style door so it's easy to walk inside and out without having to go around the ropes from Penn Avenue. Definitely give this a try on a cool summer evening in August and sunny Saturday's during Spring and Fall. Oh and did I mention they have a DJ on   When you walk in the door the first thing that you noticed is the decor. Every wall is filled with Mural [My favorite is Cali's clown fish - painted by a local artist] off Fish or decorated with over-sized swordfish replica. The back wall behind the pillar has a mid-sized aquarium with live fish. [There were rumors on having a shark in there once]. The main room has round table seating with tables made of giant spools similar to the ones you can find on a boat. Off to the right side of the restaurant is a large bar where one of their excellent bartenders will make you anything your heart desires, whether a regular vodka soda, to super strong long island iced teas or warming hot toddies [I had a terrible cold and no voice the first time I came here - instant love]. Usually I get a standard Pinot Grigio [I am so common]   Making your way to the back the upstairs divides itself into a private lounge and a Loft lounge. The upstairs will have Hightops and you can peer over the balcony over the rest of the restaurant. The private lounge is perfect for any company dinner all you have to do is watch out for the stuffed brown bear.  Now to the actual point -- the Food! Because I am an appetizer junky we shall start there: You cannot go wrong with the Lobster Bisque. It is thick and buttery with a generous helping of actual lobster rather than just the flavor or the shreds I have gotten in many Bisques elsewhere. This bisque has spoiled me by far - my favorite ever. The coloring is on the darker brown end to me that just means heartiness. Btw - you can get this at the Wholey's grocery store as well and you will not be disappointed. Luke's serves this in a Yinzer version - which means there are Lobster bisque fries. [that's a little much for me].  The catfish bites are delectable, light and fluffy. Little breading and a chili sauce to dunk it in, same thing with the calamari [just basil marinara rather than chili]. Speaking of some spice - I recently shared the mussels and they are just the treat. Beware of the portion though, this could definitely be a meal just for yourself, so get this when you are sharing. I personally do not like Oysters so I take this from a friend's review: You get a lot of them as a variety from both Atlantic and Pacific. In the summer they even serve them over ice outside. [naturally when the sun isn't shining directly on them]  For entrees the same goes as the appetizers. Large portions of delicious on delicious. Because of my stuffing with apps, my boy and I shared the Fish and Chips Platter with Scallops and Jumbo Shrimp. No disappointment here, the breading was light, the portion generous and the scallops so soft. you can never go wrong with Wholey's scallops, whether eating out or at home dinner party as Wine and Cheese share-ables. While we did not have it the crab stuff salmon walked by our table and smelled amazing. I can't wait to go back and try it.  As Luke has fish in his blood you will get daily specials on a regular basis, when he has awesome catches they usually end right on the menu as a taco or lightly fried up bites. If you see him, he will gush you into trying everything.  Other things to mention: Have an event here! I personally have hosted 3 of them now [2 for my CMU MBAs and 1 for the Pittsburgh Happy Hour Annual Party] and Jason the Manager is so helpful and easy to deal with. I continue to overwhelm him with an eating bunch and despite running our waiters ragged, everybody was beyond pleased. Be sure to be considerate for both the holiday season and the Wholey's Annual party in the Summer so plan ahead. The staff is more than helpful.  Make sure to ask about the rewards points. Yup - a restaurant with rewards points. Every $200 you get $20 credited so you can come back and enjoy again. Oh - make sure to register it so you protect your balance. I recently lost mine [upset!] so don't do what I did.   Love this place and need to rush back soon to try again.",

Of course I had to get the Bloody Mary (it was Sunday after all) I just added the candied bacon - next time I'm going for it and adding the shrimp and soft shell crab!  I ordered the shrimp po boy - wasn't what I expected but it was pretty tasty - not knock my socks off good but tasty just the same and I don't know if I was just starving but the French fries were delicious. Hubby's blackened catfish Sammy, on the other hand, was awesome.  Super tasty and huge!  Probably would come here again but it is a little pricey.",

    "text": "Went last night with my wife for a date night.  We wanted to try someplace new and she wanted seafood.  I stumbled across the reviews here and decided to give it a shot.  I have to say I was quite pleased.    We were quickly seated and our waiter came over to take the order.  He was really good and made suggestions on both food and drinks.  We had the catfish bites as an app and it was excellent!  The fish was lightly breaded and the thai chili dipping sauce had a fantastic flavor.    For dinner, we both had the shrimp and scallops meal with two different preparations.  Both were very good but the blackened one was excellent in my opinion!  The only negative was the asparagus.  It seemed like it had been grilled hours ago and left to sit in a steamer or something for a long time.  It was tough, stringy and tasteless.  When I mentioned it to our waiter, he apologize profusely and offered us a dessert for free.  We ordered dessert but turned down the freebie as the bad veggie certainly didn't ruin the overall meal.  I only gave it four stars because: a) it is kind of noisy inside and would be very noisy if the place was packed, b) the ambiance is a little strange, and c) the bad asparagus.  I will definitely try it again in the future though.",

    "text": "I am so, so pleased with my experience here today. Three of us were walking around the Strip on a Saturday and we got pretty hungry around 1pm. I quickly pointed over across the street to this place since I've never been here. We walked in and were waiting on the hostess to seat us. I was looking around and most of the tables were full. Large TVs had march madness stuff going and orders were being delivered left and right. We waited not even five minutes to be seated, but the hostess appeared frazzled over so many people coming in.  We were seated at a table in the back left. It was a spacious table with comfy chairs. Our waitress walked over within a few minutes and she was so quick to get our drinks. I got water and unsweetened iced tea. I looked over the menu and became way too excited for sushi. It's absolutely my favorite thing to eat so I was ready to order the whole menu. I narrowed it down to miso soup, seaweed salad, tuna & salmon sashimi. The two other people I was with ordered fish and chips, a burger, and an Alaskan roll. We chatted while we waited and I felt like our orders came out fairly quickly even though the place was busy. Also, I noticed how it wasn't insanely loud. A plus for sure.   My unsweetened iced tea tasted strong and I liked that because most iced teas taste very watered down to me. Heidi, our waitress, brought over my miso soup and shortly after my sashimi and seaweed salad were delivered. Oh my gosh my sashimi was beautiful, fresh, and extremely delicious! The same goes for miso soup and seaweed salad, which was the tastiest I've had so far in Pittsburgh. I was head over heels for my food. I've finally found the sushi I've been dreaming of. Heidi was fabulous at keeping our drinks refilled and coming back to check on all of us. I liked that she didn't abandon us after getting us our orders.  Towards the end of our meals, I decided I wanted to try a rainbow roll and asked if I could have it without rice. I wasn't trying to be a pain in the butt and I rarely ever ask for substitutions of any kind. Heidi said she'll see what she could do. She didn't say no and she didn't ignore my request. She put my order in and I was treated to an incredible modification with rainbow roll filling surrounded by a cucumber shell. It tasted amazing. I went over and praised/thanked the sushi chefs because they got creative and they provided excellent customer service. I thanked Heidi as well. She was so kind, bubbly, and an overall joy that added to our dining experience. We all adored her! Praise for the customer service, the food, and overall atmosphere. I was so happy and I'm definitely coming back for more of that sushi!",

She was very friendly and sat down to talk to our oldest. We exchanged stories throughout the evening about our kids. She made sure the kids were always taken care, which is HUGE in my book. I got a sangria and it was delicious! They have a good variety for drinks. We ordered edamame and sushi for apps. It was good! Our dinners... EXCELLENT!!! I highly suggest this place.

    "text": "We stopped here for dinner after a full day in the Strip and were told it'd be 45 minutes for a table for two. Fortunately it only was about 5 minutes!! Our server was very friendly and attentive. We ordered the catfish bites and lobster bisque. The catfish bites were disappointly not crispy on the outside, though they were still good. They would have been better crispy instead of rather floppy and soggy. The lobster bisque was yummy, but for a giant bowl we only got one little \"crustini\" I believe it was called. Two or three would have been better for the size of the bowl. My husband and I shared the two dishes, and it was plenty for us. The portions were great, and the prices weren't bad at all. I recommend it for sure.  An added perk was Robert Wholey (the owner's father) stopped by our table and talked to us for a minute. Later he offered us some oyster.  It was a great addition to our evening to get to say hello to him and meet the face behind Wholey's in the Strip!!! He was very kind!  We'll be going again!!",

Maybe bc ppl like Tom Brady continue to dominate the NFL when you really just wish he'd jump off a cliff. I had the salmon with crab in a ginger soy glaze. Salmon was overcooked yet the skin was flabby. Had lobster bisque to start, which justifies one star. An hour and fifteen minutes later I got my overcooked salmon and 2nd drink. The glaze was pretty sweet and definitely cancelled out the crab since it got lost in the glaze. Dessert was included in the restaurant week menu but we finally asked for it to go after a 2+ hour experience. We had reservations and the hostess mentioned that they had stopped accepting walk-ins that night bc of the amount of reservations they had. Not sure why they seemed surprised by the size of the crowd - and to me, it seemed normal. Service was subpar at best. Ah well. Disappointed but I'll live.",

Then we ordered King Alaskan crab, oysters, and the cluster of crab legs (they were out of the Maryland crab legs which was the main reason we went). Again, we managed. Then it took WAY too long for the oysters to come out considering they were raw. It took over another hour for the crabs to come out. And sadly they were nothing special at all. We spent $100 and came home to eat because there was not a lot of food and it was unexceptional. We will likely not be back and wouldn't recommend the crabfest",

It features an urban ambience with clear garage doors on the front on the joint that can be opened if the weather is nice, and hand painted brick walls of sea creatures, waves and a giant ship. When we walked in the restaurant smelled delicious. It put me right in the mood for our meal.   We went during lunch time which is when they offer a lunch menu with lunch friendly options and pricing. Our bill for four entrees, one appetizer and one beer was $83. They also have a pretty insane Bloody Mary menu. You can customize your own by adding bacon strips, shrimp and other goodies. They looked insanely good!  Our server was amazing; super knowledgeable, friendly and gave great recommendations! He noticed my dad was drinking a TON of water and brought him a giant beer mug of water. Lol. The food was very tasty, unique, and was well presented. It was very appealing to the eyes!  Towards the end of our meal, the owner's father (who is the owner of the fish market), came by our table to check on us and we ended up chatting for about 15 minutes. He was a very neat and interesting guy. I'd love to sit down with him over a beer.   I definitely recommend checking this place out! Well worth it!",

    "text": "Came in for a nice Valentine's Day meal. From the beginning, It looked like there was no hope and that Yelp had led me wrong. It took almost 15 minutes just to get bar service and my simple drink was wrong; a Dry Vodka Martini using Stoli vodka and adding three olives. It took 10 minutes to get the wrong drink. At the same time, I ordered the Old Bay Peel and Eat Shrimp.   Once seated at a regular table, it took another ten minutes to get a server to come over. Once she came over, she was extremely rude about taking my order. I get she was rushed, but eye rolling and teeth sucking doesn't fly with me. I took Yelp's suggestion and ordered the Lobster Bisque Fries. Can we say over cooked Lobster with a nasty sauce? There was nothing good about the fries...except for the bacon...but bacon makes the world awesome.   When the Shrimp finally came out, I was initially impressed to see homemade cocktail sauce. I was disappointed in the fact it was full of Horseradish to the point of being inedible. The shrimp themselves were okay. They had no discernable Old Bay on them. If I wanted plain shrimp, I would have ordered the Shrimp Cocktail.  I had to flag down a server to bring me a glass of water; I waited from the moment I sat at the bar until I finally grabbed someone to bring me water well after my Martini had been drained.  When my dish came out (I ordered the Seafood Trio) I think there were 3 full cups of pasta on my plate. The Mussels and Clams were chewy and very overcooked while the scallop (could only find one scallop, two shrimp, and three each of Mussels and Clams) was cool in the middle. The pasta was overcooked and the sauce just had a weird, sweet taste to it. The portion size was also way too large; I could've easily split the dish three ways and all three of us would've gone home full.  All in all.  Food: 4/10. The parts that were edible were okay.  Service 0/10. The server I had was extremely rude and inattentive. She could've cared less and it showed. Also, it was hard to tell who the servers were as no one was in what could even be remotely considered uniform attire: My server was wearing a spaghetti strap tank top and yoga pants, another server was in a nice black shirt and dress slacks, another server was in a red shirt and dress pants. The bartenders were inattentive and couldn't even make a simple drink.  For the price I paid, I could've easily have gone somewhere else that I know serves good food and had a great dinner. I'd go here if you had a gift certificate to cover the meal, or on a slower night so the chefs could be more attentive to what they are doing, but I will most likely never go back again. Poor service is enough to sour any meal.",

Which by the way has 20 some ingredients that all adds together for the BEST Bloody Mary of my life! I have craved one ever since leaving Pittsburgh!) But, I digress.. My boyfriend & I split the \"Land & Sea\" which included a 6 oz filet mignon, grilled shrimp, scallops & delicious mashed red potatoes. So, in conclusion, if you ever have the pleasure of going to Pittsburgh & only have a chance to eat at one restaurant.. Make it this one! You won't regret it!  p.s.

It felt like they went to the fields to pick the mint first. It seemed like the manager was out and no one was in charge. Pricey for this kind of service.",

    "text": "I stopped by here earlier today with my father for lunch.  Not too long ago I had been here with a Yelp party and was lucky enough to taste some of their oysters and shrimp with the Oysters Rockefeller and shrimp both being delicious.  Since my dad likes a good fish, I decided that I would take him sometime for lunch.  We were seated immediately upon entering the restaurant and given the choice to sit inside or outside.  I chose inside even though it was pretty much the same as being outside.  You see, they have a garage door type device so that the restaurant opens onto the street.  With the perfect weather today, my dad and I both enjoyed our seats.  For lunch we decided to start off our meal with the lobster bisque fries.  It is exactly what you would expect from a name like that, a bunch of fries on a plate with a decent helping of lobster bisque dumped over them.  The bisque tasted awesome and I was pretty happy about the large chunks of lobster that were sitting on top of the fries.  While the fries tasted nicely too, I wasn't as big of a fan of how soggy some of them got.  Even so I enjoyed the inventiveness and taste of it.  For my entree I decided to have the shrimp po boy and chose the buffalo aioli to go with it while my dad went with the fried cod sandwich.  Both dishes came with a side of fries that looked like they were freshly cut. My sandwich was pretty good and I enjoyed the buffalo aioli but I think still think that it lacked something.  So while I liked it, I honestly can't say that I loved it.  My dad did say that he really enjoyed his sandwich as the fish was good. I should also note that our server was also very friendly to us and helped to make our experience nice.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  While nothing during today's lunch jumped out at me as amazing and today's lunch on its own would be 3 stars, I do know that there shrimp here is very good, so maybe I just ordered badly?  In any case, I do think that it is worth stopping by to give a try.",

I was happy to see that the restaurant was opened up to the sidewalk, which allows for some pretty entertaining people watching while you hang out and wait for your food.  We went out for an early dinner on a weeknight, and the restaurant was surprisingly full.  Another good sign.  The table we were seated at was a huge (recycled?) spool and that the walls were covered with colorful nautical murals. The overall ambiance really lends itself to a fun, casual seafood restaurant.  Our waitress was very accommodating and was willing to go out of her way to answer our questions. I went with two sushi rolls, the sweet potato roll and alaska roll.  The former was probably one of my favorite rolls ever.  The tempura battered, deep-fried sweet potato was topped off with eel sauce, making for one delicious sweet and salty combo.  I can't wait to go back and order it again!  This is somewhere I will definitely be returning to, especially while the weather is nice!  I would highly recommend bringing out-of-towners here to experience the Strip while dining on tasty seafood and sushi!",

    "text": "Well, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect for Luke Wholey's.  From the second it was announced, I thought I'd be hooked.  All I could think about were delicious big  fish sandwiches, sushi inspired by Tommy (note, if you've never had Tommy's sushi from Wholey's Market...  you're missing out), and lobster bisque smothered on everything.  A quick glance at the menu made me think my dreams had come True...  but then the Groupon was announced.   Knowing my luck with group-deal joins has been about a 40-60 success rate, I had my concerns.  Nevertheless, I purchased the deal, and to much delight, I heard multiple good reviews from fellow Yelpers in the interim.  Getting to the point...  what a letdown.  The lobster bisque fries were downright bland.  Poorly fried potatoes literally swimming in bisque and garlic  butter lead to something that couldn't find an identity between smothered fries, chowder, and the remains of a beaver damn after a really bad flood.  My swordfish, while massive, was overcooked to the point of serving better as a rubber mallet (bland tasting to boot).  The fiance's seafood pasta, while swimming with what seemed to be a high quality orgy of sea creatures, lacked much flavor and desperately needed salt and other seasoning (which we had to get up and ask a bus boy for along with silverware as our server was nowhere to be found...  another story).  The only reason for the 3 star review, is that the blue point oysters we sampled were hands down the best I've had in the burgh.  Couple this with a decent side for the swordfish of potatoes, cabbage, and bacon, and overall, I felt like we at least at a meal at the quality of what we paid for the Groupon.  Will be venturing back for brunch (one more deal to go), so I'll provide an update after that endeavor.",

I came here for an event earlier this week and was able to sample a variety of their oysters. If these were any indication of the rest of the food, then I can't wait to come back and try a full meal (- the blue-crab stuffed salmon is first on the list). My favorite was their version of oysters rockefeller, which I could have eaten an entire plate of. We were also given a shucking demonstration, which was super fun - they make it look so easy! Everyone that works there is very passionate about seafood, especially the owner who seems very involved in the daily operations of the restaurant (and is also very cute :)  ).   The space itself is great - it is decorated well to fit the theme of the restaurant. I will be back soon to try a few more items from the menu!",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Luke Wholey's on a Saturday evening for dinner. We got the lobster fries and calamari as an appetizer. Both were delicious. We devoured the entire portion of fries in minutes. It was smothered in cheeses and lumps of lobster. SO GOOD! The calamari was also very satisfying. It was breaded and fried to perfection and the portion was a reasonable size. But did I mention the lobster fries? For real, those were heaven on Earth.  For dinner, I got the crab stuffed salmon. It was served with a side of fried potatoes. The sauce on the salmon was so flavorful. It had a hint of a maple syrup taste to it and I found myself dipping the potatoes in it too. The salmon was cooked to perfection and the crab stuffing was so good, I could have eaten a bowl of it on its own.   My husband got sushi, which he told me was good, but not the best he's ever had. It got the job done in satisfying his sushi tooth.   On top of the great food, the environment in Luke Wholey's also added to the positive experience. The second floor/loft space was a little warm because the air conditioning doesn't make it up there, but it wasn't too bad considering it was a 90 degree day. They really did a great job at creating a beachy/waterfront type restaurant where I felt like I was on vacation in Florida rather than sitting in the Strip District. I'm not sure if that's what they were going for though considering it's Luke Wholey's Wild ALASKAN Grille. Either way, it was nice to feel like I was on vacation even though it was just another Saturday night in the burgh.   Bottom line: Amazing food, great environment. I can't wait to visit again!",

Never a bad meal although the service on two occasions was subpar the manager more than made up for it. Fish n Chips is best around and you can add jumbo shrimp and scallops for an up charge which I recommend if you're hungry. The Caesar salad with homemade dressing rocks  and always a choice of mine. Salmon, blackened Swordfish and Alaskan king crab are all stellar entrees. A friend of mine even had their chicken parmesan and I was amazed it was pretty good  being this is a seafood restaurant. I rarely have dessert but the  pumpkin cheesecake was one of the best I've ever had and ordered it on two occasions although I'm not sure it was made in house. If you're looking for fresh seafood this is the place !!",

Of particular note were the catfish bites and sandwich, the lobster fries, and huge peel-your-own shrimp. Everything was  nicely cooked and presented. There was a great selection of craft beers and the server knew the wines very well.   In spite of some Yelp reviews we had read about the service, ours was outstanding. Our server, Brian, had only been working there a few days but was already up-to-speed on menu items. Everything came out quickly, especially for a large group.

The portions are incredibly generous. One day me and my boyfriend came here and got the shrimp volcano to share. Even after splitting it we had leftovers! The lobster bisque fries are insane.

Wish I had researched a little more....service was slow, took 5 minutes from getting the menu to any further attention.  Ordered the shrimp & scallops, took 20 or more minutes to get the entree even with a pretty empty restaurant and the shrimp was overlooked.  Wouldn't be my first choice for a return trip.  Meh.",

    "text": "I went to Luke Wholey's Wild Alaskan Grille a couple Friday nights ago.  First of all the atmosphere was great. I loved the lighting, earth tone colors and the large projection screen to watch a Pens game (or Steeler or Pirates for that matter).   Food was amazing. I ordered the crab stuffed salmon with red mashed potatoes and my date had fresh seared scallops and shrimp and mashed potatoes.   Last but not least, the staff was wonderful. Except for a tiny mix up when paying my bill the wait staff was friendly and even comedic at times.  I listed them on my blog with a little more info as well if anyone is interested in checking it out at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmidnightguru.com%2Fplace.php%3Fid%3D112&s=9f4d89539ddb0eca8587e485e96135699181d044edd06cf16cc091b0f55d695c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">midnightguru.com/place.p...</a>",

    "text": "The food was good, but when the bill came there were issues.  I want to start off by saying Luke walked around and introduced himself and made sure everything was OK- which was very nice especially on a Saturday.  The food came out fast, fries where underdone, but sandwiches made up for that.  The issue...The sandwich board out front said bloody mary's $6 - we were charged $8.  When we questioned the price difference the waiter seemed baffled that we were questioning it.  Being in a hurry, we paid the bill.  We had 6 drinks  paying $12 too much for the bloody Mary's that my group consumed.  If we go back, we will push the issue if it happens again.",

    "text": "For a restaurant being in the Strip District, I was surprise how affordable our seafood dinner was compare to the other seafood restaurants were that weren't as good.  Everything was really fresh & portions was huge.  I'm a big eater & I actually split my entree. It usually takes me two entrees to get full. The appetizers were delicious! Our starters were the Thai shrimp, cajun boil shrimp, fried calamari & crab cakes. For my entree I had the frutti de mare pasta (which i split & came out looking like a full entree), others had the crab salad, shrimp scampi (it looked like it had over a dozen large prawns in it) and linguini with  clams.  This is a must go to again if i want seafood in Pittsburgh.  The host was really nice & even walked the tables to say hi & ask if our meal was ok. The waitress was pretty tipsy but got our orders out in time.",

I was surprised how attentive they were to a customer that had gone there for the first time.  We have been there at least 6 times.  Probably the best Bloody Mary I've ever had north of Florida!",

    "text": "So I had the same experience both times I came into this place. You walk in and it's kind of a cluster. The same hostesses seems stressed which is maybe due to the un organization but she's barely pleasant. Both times waiting for a someone to come to our table to get drinks and has resulted in a switched server. The first time our server told us our original server was too stressed to take our table on and the second time he barely paid attention to us leading my dad to just go right to the bar we were sitting by and order our drinks after waiting 20 with no offer. Then causing our server to change again. But once things get going it has turned out to be pretty good. Both times we have been here the food was delicious and fresh. The cod sandwiches are so huge you could share it with someone. Last time we ordered the lobster bisque fries as an appetizer and that was a stand out, so good! My dad said the mussels were equally as good. If it weren't for the rocky service here, it'd be a four. So if you go have some patience especially if you're hungry/thirsty! I think two visits were enough for me.",
