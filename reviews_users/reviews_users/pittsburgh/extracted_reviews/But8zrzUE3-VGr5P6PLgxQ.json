    "text": "I am pleased with Brueggers.  Quick and inexpensive food that you can eat if there is nothing else you are tasting.  I need those \"fall-back\" places for times that I am ambivalent to the world.  Today, we ordered the following items:  Butternut squash soup Chicken spaetzle soup Ham egg and cheddar on toasted onion bagel Chicken chipotle club on toasted onion bagel minus lettuce (use the Turkey Chipotle Club as a base)  Being from Florida, the soups were a hot welcome -- I was SO cold today.  The chicken spaetzle soup -- think chicken noodle with the noodles replaced with dumplings -- was rather good.  It wasn't too salty and the spaetzle wasn't mushy.  I wouldn't rave about the flavor of the broth, but I enjoyed what I ate.  The butternut squash soup, while lumpy and stringy, had a nice flavor with a slight piquancy to it.  It is amazing that the butternut squash soup can taste better at Bruegger's than at Season 52.    Since I am picky and finicky about what I eat, I special ordered my chicken bagel-wich.  It took a little bit longer to make, but I am used to that -- it's a special order, what do you expect.  The staff was up to the task and were all blunt and to the point with everything they said; my kind of people.    By no means gourmet, the bagel-wiches still had good flavor.  There was no undue piquancy in the chipotle, just some flavor to compliment the chicken and the tomato.  The addition of the toasted onion bagel was nice.  The ham, egg, and cheddar was average; but for being in downtown Pittsburgh -- and unable to make it home -- it is a passable substitute.    I will definitely return.",

    "text": "Holy cow Batman. I couldn't believe the line at DD the morning we were scheduled to head home. Being impatient people and only having 2 breakfast options within walking distance, Brueggers won by default.   I ordered some spicy wrap that had jalapeno cream cheese, egg, sausage and peppers and a chai tea. My husband ordered the cheese bagel with onion & chive cream cheese and a coffee.  The food was more than satisfactory. In fact, it was pretty good. I think if we were locals I would have bought 10 tubs of that chive cream cheese and ate it with a spoon. I'll admit I had my doubts when he ordered it, but it was scrumptious. The jalapeno cream cheese was too hot for me, but I can't blame them-- I'm just a wuss. I had to scrape most of it off. The chai was some of the best I've had lately!  The reason for 3 stars was the fact that it took an insane amount of time for our order -- at least 25 minutes from the time we walked in. There was only 1 person ringing the register and 1 person making the food. The guy ringing the register eventually came to help prepare the food (because she couldn't make it all by herself) but it was after standing there for around 10 minutes realizing that no one was coming down to the register because no food was prepared. I'm not sure if there was a call off or if someone quit, but they needed at least one more sets of hands to get through the breakfast rush in a reasonable amount of time.  I do have to give mad props to the girl preparing the food because I probably would have threw my hands up and gave up with the amount of people she had to wait on, but she did a great job and managed to be personable with everyone in line.",

The food isn't spectacular, but it is dependable. You can create your own salad, and they usually have three soups to choose from. Because I'm not a big bread eater, I normally stick with soups and salad, but I do hear the bagels are delicious.  The chicken they use for salads looks and tastes like mystery meat, so go for the ham or no meat at all. There are a variety of veggie options for salads, so I usually do veggies. You can also add nuts, dried cranberries, or diced apples.  Today I had the chili because I was craving something hearty. It was nice and spicy, and I could visibly see the chunks of bell pepper in the soup. I would definitely get it again on a cold day.  This location is convenient to almost anything on Grant Street or in the vicinity of the William Penn Hotel. The interior is on the small side, so if you want to sit during lunch, come at 11 or after 1:30.",

The order line was backed up. There were 3 employees working who would just disappear for 5 minutes at a time. The manager is completely oblivious. We witnessed multiple people just walk out even though they had already paid. Our food didn't come out and all of the people behind us in line were getting their orders SLOWLY but getting them. We had to show the girl working our paper receipt because she couldn't find our order on the POS screen. Then, she got my bagel spread wrong!!! The bagels had what I would call a splash of cream cheese on them. This place is a disaster. When we arrived a man who was waiting for his order said \"good luck\" to us as we got in line. Yes, you definitely need luck and time if you decide to go here....oh and also the patience of a saint.",

I asked the lady if there were nuts in it (I don't have an allergy, I just don't like nuts in my brownies or blondies....that doesn't make me a monster!  Or does it?)  Anyway, she didn't know if there were nuts in it or not.  I manned up and got it anyway and it was delicious.  I didn't taste any nuts (no comments from the peanut gallery) so my vote says \"no nuts\".  Anyway, if you need a bagel and you're nearby, this should meet your basic requirements.",

Update:  3 months later and still no improvement.  I can't get over how slow this place is.  It's remarkable at how many employees they have it still it's difficult to manage 3 to 4 customers in the store at a time.  First piece of advice... stop batching the orders before carrying them to the end of the counter to give to the customer.  Right now your employees are collecting about 5 orders before carrying them to the other end of the counter to distribute.  Stop doing this.  It is slowing your service down.  Give each order to the customer as soon as it is completed.  Additionally the food won't be cold when the customers get it.",

I understand how it can be working in a fast-paced environment ( I use to work at the Duquesne University Jamba) but again I was let down tremendously. Someone cut me in line, I waited for 10 minutes for a tropical bowel and when I opened it, I realized I was cheated out of the blended goodness. It was icy as if not enough liquid was added (nor did anyone think to fix the problem) and it covered not even 1/4 of the bowel. I paid a little over 7 dollars and I wish I would've just went somewhere else on my lunch break. I refuse to waste anymore money or time there. I guess the positive part is that I did have a friendly cashier this time.",

    "text": "Came here with a friend as I had heard from him that this is the only Jamba Juice in the Pittsburgh metro area (sad, right?). Ended up getting the Peach Perfection fruit smoothie only (no yogurt or milk base, etc.). Service here was pretty fast since it was near closing time, but I can only imagine how busy this place can be especially during weekdays during work hours. In general the smoothie was pretty good. I do indeed appreciate the fresh fruit that is used in the smoothie, but for some reason, the smoothie itself seems to lack the fruity tangy flavor that I normally associate Jamba Juice drinks with when I've had them in the past. Not sure if it's due to inexperience or whatever, but I would hope that this would be improved on ... might be due to the very real possibility that since this place is so busy during normal hours on weekdays that the people trained here are so that they produce (quantity over quality), which would be most tragic indeed. Not sure if I'd return here again, but I might a little down the road to see if the other Jamba Juice drinks also follow the same trend (I really like Jamba Juice, if you can't already tell, haha)",

Which is a shame because there's a nice Bruegger's a few blocks away with employees that actually give a crap about your order, except they don't sell the Jamba Juice or have tomato soup daily. Today I visited for a bowl of soup and the 16oz juice. Fairly certain I actually received a cup of soup and a 12oz juice. The employee making food was wearing gloves but sneezing on them and seemed like he wasn't bothered with not touching counters and the cash register with them on. Also, mostly everyone was just standing around chatting. The line was not long, but it took about 10 minutes to get my juice and soup. Both were good, but disappointing that I didn't get the proper sizing, especially when it was over $10. I'll probably be back because it's convenient to my work, but I know not to expect much!",

I had hoped that, after some time had passed, they might have fixed their problems. Spoiler alert - they did not.   I was in line behind three people. I ordered a toasted bagel with nothing on it and bought a tub of cream cheese. They did not even offer to put my cream cheese in a bag. I had to grab one myself from the pick-up area.   I set the timer on my phone to see how long it would take. From the time I ordered until I got my bagel, it was 9 minutes and 57 seconds. Ten minutes for a simple toasted bagel.   I saw people who I'm pretty sure came in after me get their orders. When I saw a girl get her order that I was positive had ordered at least five minutes AFTER me, I asked where my bagel was. The girl was extremely rude and said, \"IT'S COMING!\" She then grabbed my bagel hard enough to leave a thumb print in it and squish out most of the cream cheese. Yes, I ordered it plain, but she put cream cheese on it. I didn't see this or the thumb print until I got back to my office.   And, if the service doesn't chase you away, the disgusting dining area should. The floor is so sticky, it pulled off my shoe after I was standing in one spot a few minutes. My loafer stuck to the floor and my foot came out of it.   I do judge restaurants very strongly based on the cleanliness of their dining area. I mean, this is what you allow me to see. If you can't keep that clean, what does your kitchen look like. EWW!",

They now have room for two separate lines to order food. On top of the addition of smoothies and drinks, it looked as if their regular menu expanded a tad too. There was a few burgers on the menu, which the hubby tried. I stuck to a Turkey Chipotle Club, which came on an everything bagel. My turkey sandwich was loaded thick with turkey. It tasted pretty darn good for a turkey sandwich, which I imagine would make a great lunch item. The hubby's burger was probably what you would expect for a burger served at a place known for bagels. It tasted like a frozen beef patty, warmed up in a microwave and thrown in between two slices of toast. We also ordered two smoothies. I don't recall the names but they were pretty tasty as far as smoothies go.   I'm going to give Bruegger's a pass as I was here for a training event and they still hadn't worked out the kinks yet when I came. My husband's burger probably took over a half hour to prepare. Anyone who ordered a burger waited for a very long time for their food. I felt bad because my turkey sandwich came out within minutes, I finished my meal and the burger still wasn't ready.   I work on the other side of town so I don't know how often I'll stop here, but it's good to know that there's a nice one stop lunch spot should I feel like making the trip!",

I wish we had one in Daytona!  Fresh. Flavorful. Consistent. Kind.",

We stood in line for 20 minutes because Bruegger's and Jamba Juice were busy. When it came time to order Pomegranate Paradise and Strawberry Swirl (which we were very much looking forward to), we were told Jamba Juice was too backed up. The issue is that: there was no announcement made nor was this posted anywhere. I'm not sure I'll give this place my business if they handle being busy by turning customers away. Sad!",

Unfortunately this is the only Jamba Juice location in the Pittsburgh/Cranberry area, but be advised that it is not a \"typical\" Jamba Juice. This location does not have the option of earning Jamba Juice points/rewards (which is odd, but I was willing to look past this). What I was not willing to overlook is that you cannot use Jamba Juice gift cards at this location. This is what I was told by the woman cashier working on 7/20/18 at 3pm (she had a bullring septum piercing). Not only is it pretty ridiculous that this location doesn't accept gift cards from their own company, but this worker was really rude in the way that she spoke to my friend and I. This was the first time my friend had ever been to a Jamba Juice, and unfortunately it was not a good experience. My friend offered to pay, since we were told we couldn't use the gift card, but I opted for us to just leave because this is not the typical service that is provided at other Jamba Juice locations (I am from Southern California, so Jamba Juice is a typical go-to for me).  Needless to say, my friend was disappointed that he was unable to try a smoothie, and I was disappointed that this location had bad customer service and a lack of payment handling abilities.",

I don't know if it's just a coincidence, but there's hardly a long wait and I never have an issue with my order. Sure, some of the employees could smile or not seem so annoyed, but anyone that works/has worked in customer service has those days. It also looks like they changed their menu so it's very easy to read and follow now.

If you walk in and see more than 3 people in line, you should just leave. The workers don't change their gloves, they touch their phones, they touch their drinks, and then they still take 10-15 minutes to make a simple bagel. One time I went in and it was slow, but still every single trash can was overflowing, every table was dirty, there was a puddle of coffee on the floor. The employees don't care, and I don't really blame them since they are probably underpaid and under bad management. Don't get me started on the Jamba Juice part of the store. If you're lucky enough to find it \"open\", then expect to wait a long time for something made completely half-assed by somebody who was probably never trained. Do yourself a favor and walk 5 minutes to the Einstein's on Grant, or to the other Bruegger's location on 4th Street, where the employees are actually helpful and friendly.  Oh, I forgot to mention that the employees will argue with each other or customers loud enough for everyone in line to hear",

For us, as out of town-ers who stay downtown while visiting, it's perfect to grab a quick, casual bite-especially when most of the quick serve businesses are closed on Sundays (and I think Saturdays in some cases too).  There's nowhere to park, so just be aware that you'll have to walk there, and if you ordered catering, you should have somebody's walk by and pick it up-there's barely room to stop and put your 4-ways on .  Also, you'll likely find it busy because again, unlike Einstein's and other quick breakfast places, they're open on weekends, so the lines can get long especially if there are a lot of people who have come in for a game and are heading over to the north shore.  Another thing to consider is how quickly they run out of things because of the busy nature and lack of competition on the weekends.  Good news is-it's right across the street from the T station, and they have now merged with Jamba Juice so you can get smoothies too!",
