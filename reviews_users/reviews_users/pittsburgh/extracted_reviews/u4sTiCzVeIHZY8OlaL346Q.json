    "text": "I cannot wait to go back!!!!!!!  This place gives me an excuse to eat well during the week, and then splurge here.  We ordered skirt steak on field greens with carmelized onions, and the shrimp with rosemary and lemon.  We loved everything we got.  We forgot this place was BYOB and the manager even offered me a glass of his own wine.  Super nice people, AMAZING steak.  The next time I go back I am doing the sampler.  I will say, if you want a standard restaurant with a server, and a sit down menu, and lots of indoor tables.  It is not for you.  If you don't mind standing, or sitting at a bar or outside tables, then you are golden. It has a New York, Boston, or Paris vibe to me. Which is exactly what Pittsburgh needed.  I am a huge fan, and I can't wait to spread the word.",

    "text": "Had an A-MAZING dinner in Pittsburgh strip district tonight!  We had a few people so we could sample a variety on our first visit. The 5 cuts of beef were all cooked perfectly and the shrimp were very good also.   We went specifically to try the empanadas and were only disappointed because they only had a few left. However, the ones they had available were ours and the were delicious!  We also sampled a variety of vegetables. The zucchini, sweet peppers, onions, mushrooms and asparagus were all grilled to perfection.  That being said, the grilled corn on the cob is a must!   The potatoes were somewhat average, but they are potatoes so what can you expect, but to quote my wife... \"the toast tastes like Christmas\".   All topped off with very friendly and attentive servers and four varieties of  sauces to top your meal, you can't go wrong at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina located in the strip district of Pittsburgh.   You might think the prices seem marginally high when you walk in but I promise you'll think you got a bargain by the time you leave.   This was our first visit to Gaucho, but certainly won't be our last!",

My boyfriend got the Rosemary beef sandwich.  And loved every bite.  I got the carne asada sandwich and it was delightful.  The music playing was artsy and fun. The whole atmosphere was positive and happy.  Be sure to try the sauces with whatever you order they come in mason jars near the ordering area and are yummy.  Was curious to see if all the hype was real and it's definitely worth your time to stand in like and enjoy the food!!!",

    "text": "After 497 reviews at the time of this writing, and with 4.5 stars, I don't think that I have too much to add on the awesomeness of this place that hasn't been said numerous times before.  I will say that they have recently enlarged the seating area - but I went around 6:30 pm on Weds, and it was still pretty packed.  People love this place, and for good reason.  Authentic, hearty, unpretentious, great grilled/charred flavor, BYOB at no charge, fast service - that alone puts it in the top restaurants in Pittsburgh.   I went on a hot summer day, and I will say that while it was air conditioned on the inside, I was quite warm.  The ac is lined on one side of the upstairs room, and is not so easily felt on the other side.  It is also a bit loud - but then I suppose that is to be expected when there are sooo many people wanting in that place.  These were very minor inconveniences given that the food was so good.  I would like to add that the overall costs for this place are very reasonable for the quality of food that you are getting.   Value is even better since there is no alcohol served here, and there is no corkage fee to bring your own alcoholic beverage.  In addition, there is no real wait staff, only a few servers and a busboy.  I think for this reason many people may not leave a tip - but there is a tip jar at the front by the cashier.  Normally, I am not a fan of most tip jars (as many places seem to have one for no reason at all), but assuming that the busboys and servers get a portion of it, I happily left one.  All of the staff here were friendly and helpful, and I hope that others reading this will realize that and leave a few bucks for the hard working staff here.",

Be prepared to stand in line, as you won't order until they have a table ready for you.  You can expect at least a 45 minute wait if you line up outside.  They are BYOB, and sometimes they even hand out glasses and openers before you get to your table.  Yum!",

    "text": "Very nice staff and atmosphere on the interior - wish there was a little more room to sit though! Regardless, the beef sandwich had a lot of potential but it fell short due to a lack of balance in two major categories; texture and flavor profile. This was mostly caused by the roasted red peppers and sauteed onions. Having three smokey ingredients on a bun is a bit overpowering and was too overwhelming on my palate. Concurrently, these roasted peppers and onions combined with the soft meat and bread robbed every bite of a much desired crunch; having cast-ironed vegetables would have been a much more welcome exchange. (I also felt the onions were overcharred)  With all that in mind, I'd still gladly come back here and try it again. Nice people.",

Popped my head in and found they opened at 11 for the next days lunch.  You can smell the smoke from outside and once you walk in it's amplified. The inside is small with my a dozen seats. The menu is written on a chalkboard on the wall, full of tough choices. We decided on the rosemary braised beef sandwich , corn and sweet potatoes. The sandwich was enormous and amazing. The corn and sweet potatoes were cooked over an open fire and also delicious.   I will definitely return next visit!",

    "text": "The Strip District, Pittsburgh's home to most ethnic foods and fresh seafood, recently got a new neighbor - a restaurant serving up wood-fire grilled fare from Argentina. I am not familiar with Argentinian food, so I was eager to try it out when I heard about the place. The space is next to the 16th street bridge(Near Altar Bar), so the cold weather had prevented me from making the hike up, until there was a nice warm break and I was finally able to walk up.  The space itself is minimal, imagine a pizza shop - 70% of the building is dedicated to the kitchen, the remaining 30% is left to standing room. There are about 3 countertops to eat at, but no stools. On the wall there is a menu, written in chalk, separated into about 4 sections: Small Plates, Hambre (Hungry), Salads, and Con Pan(Sandwiches). There are 4 types of condiments in jars in the middle of the restaurant which are there for your tasting pleasure: Chimichurri(Herbs, oil, lemon), Ajo(garlic), Cebolla(onion), and Pimenton(Roasted pepper). Gaucho also offers various ways to receive 10% off on different days. Wednesday, show your facial hair(doesn't have to be real, ladies) - Friday, show your fashion flare.   So far I've had tastes of quite a bit of the menu - The Vegetales sandwich($7, I think), two steak sandwiches(Flank and ribeye, $10 lets you choose from any beef they offer), Shrimp(6/$13 - 'hambre menu'), Empanadas(Beef, onion, and hard boiled egg, 2/$3), Chorizo($5 - small plate menu), and a pollo sandwich($8). The empanadas were hands down the best that I've ever tasted(Which should be taken with a grain of salt), the steak is incredibly flavorful and juicy, the shrimp were very large, with a sprig of rosemary stuffed into the back of each one and a lemon that was charred on the grill as well. The chorizo was full of peppery flavor and just a little bit spicy, and the veggie sandwich was piled high with peppers, zuchinni, and asparagus(my friend ordered without portabello).   You can also order two slices of oiled, grilled bread for $1. The bread here, a fresh ciabatta, is stunningly delicious, soft throughout and a crust that, while chewy, won't resist you as you bite into your sandwich. I highly recommend ordering the bread so you can try out all of the condiments. I'm a sucker for caramelized onions, so the cebolla is my favorite, but the ajo is a close second, with the others also being incredible.   I've only gone around 1:00pm, and there is usually a short line, but I'm not sure how this place handles around dinner time, or during the lunch rush. I asked about catering and the chef said that one day they'll be able to. He also said that he dreams of doing a whole cow roast one day - a goal that I can wholeheartedly stand behind.  Gaucho is a welcome addition, and I am sure I will find myself a regular here. If you work in the strip or downtown, block of some time and make the walk. If you don't, then drive down on the weekend or for dinner. Their website sums it up nicely, \"Eat Gaucho.\"",

We worried we'd be unable to find a spot to sit, but everything was perfectly timed so that we found a comfy, sunny spot in plenty of time. Don't be scared off by the lines--it's more than worth your small investment of time!  The new expanded menu is great. The new veggie empanadas were just amazing!  We had the veggie and fish con pane and our favorite papas.  The sauces were, as always, super tasty and the old butcher block serving station was a welcoming site to see after the hiatus. Everything was Scrumptious!  We cannot wait to try the paella and see the soon-to-be opened expanded dining room.",

Once we ordered, the food arrived promptly.  Parking was easy to find. They allow you to bring your own beer/wine and don't even charge a corkage fee. The coffee was dark and smooth and perfect.   The not-so-good: I guess it's their shtick but I just don't understand why they think I'd want to wait in line like cattle to order at the counter before I am seated, then have someone yell my name across a crowded room while I'm chatting with my lunch mate.  We only ended up eating here because we happened to get here when the line was still only inside the front door. And the line moves SUPER slow. I get that it's a small place so there's going to be a wait, but either let me make reservations or take my number and text me when it's ready. So unfortunately, I'm not likely to come back; there's just too many other options without the wait.",

Also really appreciate the guy who took my order and told me all about how sick he was with a fever while taking the order. Really hope this guy was not also preparing my food.   As for the food it was great. If you can put up with questionable service and a hipster crowd then by all means try this place.",

It wasn't.  It just wasn't as great as the food I got at the restaurant.    Which...okay...was great.  Sorry for the spoiler.  Great food.    No reservations, so there's usually a line, but honestly the wait was no more than probably 5 minutes AT LUNCH.    I had the special...Gaucho Banh Mi.  It was delicious.  See above.  My date had empanadas that she then shared with me.  Because she's awesome, but we're not rating her...the empanadas...ALSO awesome.    Every sauce/condiment was drinkably good (though honestly, i don't recommend that).  The staff was super high energy and friendly.  So if you don't like friendly people this may not be the place for you.    Cool vibe, great food, great staff.  Five star.  Bang.  Done.",

    "text": "Gaucho did deliver. I've been skeptical and find some of their signage off-putting. Maybe I'm getting too old or whatever.   Anyway, despite them botching our order and totally forgetting one of our entrees, they did fix it on the fly and offered us a free dessert. So, in the end they did the right thing. The root cause ended up being a new, inexperienced person at the register printing out a bad duplicate ticket for the kitchen. So it was not the kitchen's error to begin with.   So on to the food; it was absolutely delicious. I've been thinking about that skirt steak since I've had it. I've even gone so far as to call around to butcher shops and ask if they sell skirt (turns out not everyone does).   Let me review our order: an Argentino salad with medium rare flank, the grilled winter mushroom salad with medium rare skirt, along with a large order of the grilled shrimp. We ended up choosing the alfajores as our comped dessert.   I just wrote about the Rainbow Salad last week at Kaya's and said that it was a salad I would go back for as a meal. Well I guess I have to add the grilled mushroom salad on to that short list as well. The oyster mushrooms were just flame kissed and the brussel sprouts were charred just enough to make the whole salad have a meaty flavor and texture even without a bite of steak. The steak itself was truly spectacular and made my dinner date jealous despite their flank steak being excellent as well.   The Argentino salad was very good as well and got rave reviews by my date. The flank steak was cut into thick, meaty slices that were cooked perfectly.   Finally, grilled shrimp were excellent. And for a dozen at $18, while not cheap, totally worth the extra protein!  In the end, even the impromptu alfajores were delicious. And that coupled with the BYOB made it an absolutely perfect dinner. So, five stars it is, despite the wait.",

The quality of ingredients is absolutely remarkable especially for the price point. I don't think you can find better steak at Pittsburgh's most expensive steak houses. Pro tip-- at no extra cost you can upgrade the salad side on a steak plate to the garlic roasted potatoes! I also suggest if you like your steak medium-rare to get it medium, they tend to undercook. I would choose gaucho over any 5 star restaurant in this city or others",

Some of the best chimichurri you'll ever have- do yourself a favor and get some extra toast just to dip in the sauces. I recommend the Asado Platter- good to split between 4 people when you order lots of sides! The empanadas are also great, but they do sometimes run out before the end of the night, so try to get there before then!   10/10 highly recommend. Great food at a reasonable price considering the quality & quantity. Be sure to bring your own wine or beer!",

    "text": "I've been here three times - each time lured back by glowing Yelp reviews and the line snaking around the block.  Each time I couldn't figure out what I was missing.  Was it the food?  The ambiance?  The service?  Twice I even brought friends.  Maybe they could shine a light on what I was missing.  But they weren't impressed either.  The menu is on a vast, confusing chalkboard that carelessly (and unhelpfully) mingles Spanish and English.  The first time I ate here I was looking for the ribeye platter;  I couldn't find it on the board, lost  amid the sandwiches and appetizers, so I ordered a sandwich.    You order at the counter.  Since no one seems able to decipher the menu, each customer peppers the cashier with a hundred questions. This makes the ordering process very, very slow and is probably responsible for the line around the block.    The first time I asked for iced tea. All they had was bottled, so I passed.  I thought maybe I'd get another drink, but I couldn't see them on the menu, so I didn't know what my choices were.  Water it was.  I never did find out if they have anything other than water and bottled ice tea.  Once you order your food, they bring it to your table by calling out your name. One time I saw three \"Bobs\" jump up at the same time to claim their order.  Seating is plentiful - most people are still waiting to order.  A condiment bar provides four different Argentinian sauces: a chimichurri sauce, a pimento sauce, an onion sauce, and a garlic sauce.  The onion is the best. And you better like at least one, because you're going to need it for the dry, tasteless meats.  The first time it was the ribeye sandwich.  The bread was burnt and hard as an English biscuit. The ribeye was not tender, not flavorful, and was easily overwhelmed by the pound-and-a-half of roasted peppers laid on top of the sandwich.    The second time I tried the ribeye platter.  I ordered medium.  The meat came sliced, without a trace of pink.  I call that 'well done.' The meat was much the same as the first time - tough, dry and flavorless. It compares to a sirloin from Outback.  No wonder folk rave about the sauces, you need them to make the meat palatable.    The third time the meat was just as bad as the others.  Granted, at this price point I wouldn't expect Prime beef.  But if you're going to use Choice or Select, you should probably spend some time tenderizing it.  If skirt steak can be made tender, so can a ribeye.  Shoeleather sucks.",

Well, the hype is warranted! This place is everything! I mean everything. Like the moon and the stars type of everything.  I arrived around 11:30 am on a Friday. It was a good thing that I did because the lunch crowd appeared at about 11:40. Once you arrive, you stand in line, and on the wall is a large chalkboard menu. You order at the front, pay and then you are seated. Someone then, brings your order to the seating area, and yells your name. They then bring your dish to your table.   I got the Carne sandwich with rib eye and a side house salad. The sandwich was so big and scrumptious. I literally, drooled on the table when I opened it up (the sandwiches come in that sandwich paper). I should have known it would be good, the paper it was wrapped in was so greasy. The meat was so tender, and the onions, the caramelized onions leave nothing to be desired. The house salad was a perfect size, and I believe they make their own dressing. It was peppery and tangy.   I loved my experience here. The service was quick, the place was clean, and the staff was polite. It was a great place to celebrate the end of the work week!",

They have someone delegating where you should sit which helps with the wait time/worry around finding a place to sit. I'm on a strict diet for lifting and their meat/veggie options fit into my diet. Highly recommend the flank steak.",

    "text": "Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is one of the best restaurants I have ever dined at. My experience began rocky, with a 45 minute wait. But, the wait was completely worth it. The food came quickly and was extremely hot. We ordered the provoletta, empanadas, pescado sandwich, el gaucho salad, flank steak, and roasted cauliflower. Everything we ate was delectable. The el gaucho salad was scrumptious, with fresh vegetables and a light dressing. The provoletta did not disappoint either, and was one of my favorite dishes. The flank steak and pescado sandwich were otherworldly, for they burst with flavor. The empanadas were fine, but a tad lackluster in flavor compared to the other dishes ordered. My personal favorite component of the meal was the toast. Though almost everything comes with toast, but do not undermine as a plain food or label it as the underdog. It was seasoned to perfection and the right amount crunchy. To be honest, I would eat at Gaucho again just for the toast. Making Gaucho even better, the staff is amicable and quick. They made conversation with us as we waited, and you could genuinely tell they were trying to move as fast as possible so people could sit down and start enjoying their meal. The wait, in my opinion, was completely worth it but not something to be ignored. Nevertheless, I can guarantee you I will dine at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina again, even if I have to wait an hour.",

(In fact, many years ago, I'd eat lunch here weekly before they had a ventilation system and even then, 10/10.)  I always go with at least a party of 4 and go all in with the meat platter and a bunch of sides and bread- family style. The BYOB option is incredible. The process to order and sit is very streamlined and I appreciate the ease.   Make sure to try all of the sauces, each one is delicious.   #bringbackcampfireyams",

    "text": "Where do I even begin with Gaucho? This is one of the best restaurants in the city, and an absolute must-try if you haven't been yet.  Gaucho is a tiny little place in the Strip that you might miss if you're not looking for it. Often times when you drive past you'll see lines out the door at this small brick building. I actually like the way Gaucho is set up - instead of being seated and having a waiter, you just wait in line to order at the register and then go scope out a table. The employees will call out your order as soon as it's ready. Overall I think this strategy makes the process go a little more quickly, which is good since it's always so packed! They don't take reservations here, but if you come on a weekday before around 6 PM you shouldn't have to wait long at all. My boyfriend and I came on a Wednesday at 5:45 and had no problem finding a table and getting our food in record time. Bring a bottle of wine with you - this is one of the only restaurants in the city that I've discovered that is truly BYOB (no uncorking fee!).  I've been to Gaucho twice now and have been overly impressed with the food both times. Absolutely everything on the menu here is so deliciously flavorful; you honestly can't make a bad choice when deciding what to get. I highly recommend the classic steak sandwich with the rib-eye. The roasted vegetables are also a favorite. I have never had such delicious grilled veggies in my life! The steak empanadas are also wonderful. The best part about Gaucho's food, in my opinion, is the way that all the strong flavors mesh together so beautifully. You won't find a bland dish here!  This is one of those restaurants in Pittsburgh that I will keep coming back to again and again. If you haven't been, you need to go TODAY!",

The 5-6 stools were against the wall and window. They also had a patio area that was open only in the summer. Anyway, I went back today and they've expanded. The place so huge! So glad... no more standing around and giving someone the death stare as they are enjoying their deliciousness. My friend and I got the Chuleta Cochina (pork chops), Caldo del Mar (seafood soup), Brussels Sprouts and bread pudding. The pork chops can feed 2 people -- it didn't come with a side so order one! I ordered the brussels sprouts, they were halved and then grilled (?), maybe - anyway, it was really good! The Caldo del Mar was good, there's a little bit of a broth on the bottom with 2 pieces of bread and then Mussels/Clams and squid sat on top. We had bread pudding... it was good - can't say it's the best I've ever had but it's solid!   We were there at 6pm right before the rush at 7pm so I would definitely recommend getting there earlier. Parking wasn't bad at the time we got in and there are plenty available on the street.   I'm definitely a fan!",

Yesterday we had the chance to get there for an early dinner... and I must say, it was worth the wait! We ordered five different items to share and I don't know which was the best! The chicken Empanadas (2 for $5) were a nice start - we paired them with the dipping sauces available for a little extra flavor.  The Provoletta was amazing! Perfectly cooked and was nice to share with this amount but isn't too heavy to have all to yourself. The corn-mash (I forget the actual name) was possibly my favorite item.. served warm, it was absolutely delicious! Then we shared a sliced beef plate that had good flavor and a nice medley of veggies / caramelized onions with it.   Top that all off with the pineapple-bread pudding and a nice bottle of red (BYOB, but NO CORKING FEE!) while sitting outside was a perfect Tuesday!  Everyone was friendly and helpful when we couldn't decide all the dishes we wanted - and the wait staff was fantastic! I'll definitely be back!",

I split the Rosemary Braised Beef and the Carne Steak sandwich with a friend. GREAT idea because it was the best of both worlds! While I enjoyed the Rosemary Braised beef more, because I love horseradish and caramelized onions, the Carne Steak was just as good! The steak was so flavorful you didn't need anything else...   Unless, you're into sauces like I am! I love sauce! They had four different kids of sauce on the table in the middle of the place. I wish I could tell you what every kind was, but all I know is that they were delicious! I just wanted to steal them and put them on everything I eat all the time!   It's s small place, so beware you may have to do take out, but don't fear, they're looking to expand shortly and will hopefully offer dinner service and more!! So get thee to Gaucho ASAP!",

The lineup is pretty much worth it. But from a managerial perspective, somewhat unavoidable. But its an asset to the institution that is probably a deliberate keeper to passively keep the hype. I'll play the game any day for food that tasty though. bravo.",

    "text": "We have been wanting to try Gaucho for a while after all the great reviews and I got to sample some of their food at a previous Yelp event-it was yummy!  I was not sure what to expect and called to make reservations haha I hope they laughed at me. This place is so small and just a few counter tops to sit at. I recommend getting take out or going on a nice day when you can sit outside.  With Growler in hand  (it is BYOB) we waited in line and decided to take our food home as it was packed inside (def. a good sign).  There seems to always be a line but the food is worth the wait. My only complaint is that we went around 5:30 (be warned they close at 7 pm) and they were out of bread so no sandwiches. I mean come on how can you be out of bread.  I was super disappointed but was one of the lucky few in line that got my sandwich on the toasted bread they did have left. When we got home the food did not disappoint and the rosemary braised beef sandwich was fantastic. Had enough to make 2 extra sandwiches with the leftovers. The horseradish sauce and caramelized onion are the perfect combo with the meat. I also got the grilled veggies and corn on the cob.  I highly recommend the corn on the cob and will order 2 next time! My date got the flank steak which was cooked to perfection.  The flavors of this meat cannot be beat! I can't wait to go back as I heard they are moving to a bigger location at the end of the month.  Update:  We went for lunch since they have expanded to part of the space next store.  We waited in line of over an hour but were prepared for this.  The staff could not have been friendly from taking our order to checking on us numerous times. I ordered the same braised beef sandwich this time they had the bread to serve it on and it was the best sandwich I have had!  The new space has lots more seating!",

In regards to the private room, we held our rehearsal dinner for probably 25 people in May 2016 and I can't say enough how wonderful it was. Almost everyone said it was the best food they've ever had including people who live in LA as well as my mid-western family who aren't keen on trying different types of food. The service was above and beyond what you could ever expect. The staff was professional but fun. They took pictures of the group and joked around with them all night while also being quick and professional. I really can't praise them enough!",

I've also had the gaucho salad topped with the shredded chicken and it is outstanding. And let's  talk about those sauces... Just get as many little cups and fill them up with every single one!

The food, wow, the food - amazing! Gotta go with the meat!  My girlfriend and I split the large sirloin.  I definitely recommend getting it medium.  It is served with toast, salad, and a steak sauce.  Delicious is an understatement.  The meat is tender, and that portion alone was massive.    We also split an order of the wings.  The wings were huge, as they were five full wings (10 total).  I recommend using their homenade sauces on top of them, as they can be a bit crispy (not quite burnt). Then we each had a chicken empanada, which if you put their homemade garlic sauce on = epic.   My girlfriend and I are the type who like to leave a restaurant full, and typically finish everything on our plates.  Here, we had leftovers (just to give an idea of how much food it really is).   All that food was just $41.  ONLY $41.  Finally, we heard amazing things about their dessert, so we had to indulge.  We split the cheesecake.  Best dessert I have had in a long, long time.    So, even though I REALLY wanted to hate this place, I ended up loving it.  Keep in mind, my girlfriend and I went at 7:30 on a Wednesday and still did not get our food until 8:30. I cannot imagine what the line is like on a weekend.",

We took it over to the Beer Market in the North Shore and just raved about every bite. We all got sandwiches and since there were 6 of us all ordering different items on the menu, I can say I tried a lot of them. I couldn't tell which one I loved the best. I think 4 are tied for first. Is that possible?  The sandwiches were filling but we also got some potatoes and veggies. Potatoes were a little underdone, but the veggies were perfect.",

There's lots of great decorative accents and fixtures throughout.  It's a small space, but super cute.  The patio area also looked very cozy.  Customer service was also great!!  Personally, I was really confused by the chalkboard menu.  I had no idea what any of the categories were!  I had to ask the cashier, \"Which ones are your sandwiches???\" and \"What's all the other stuff?\"  She was super friendly and was more than happy to explain their menu to me.  When my sandwich was ready, the manager(?) brought me my sandwich and was also very friendly and even took the time to explain their sauces to me.  Seriously, I was very impressed by the customer service!!  Not because they made any huge gestures, but it was the very genuine, unhurried, and unpretentious attitude and treatment that I received.  (We all know what it's like to walk into the new hot spot/hipster hangout and get the typical unimpressed and unfriendly customer service...)  Now on to the sandwiches!!  I've had their infamous steak/carne sandwich before and it was delicious!  Even as leftovers!  So, this time I tried the Rosemary beef sandwich.  Also very good, but could have done with a little more horsey sauce in my opinion.  There's a big chunk of meat, so luckily I had taken the suggestions of the staff at Gaucho and gotten a little bit of the ojo sauce to add to my sandwich.    All the other items looked so yummy! I can't wait to come with more people to try all the sides and options.  If you haven't already given Gaucho Parrilla a try, make sure to stop by the next time you're at the strip!  It's also on the end of the strip, so that makes it an easy stop for lunch if you work dowtown!",

But, when things don't go quite as planned that is the True test of an establishment. I've been coming here weekly for some time. Two weeks ago I decided to try the \"steak burger\" cooked medium, which I have never eaten there before. I got it to go, got home, was very hungry, but midway through eating it (though it was flavorful) I felt a rumbling in the stomach and physically could not finish it. 10 minutes later I was in the bathroom with a problem. My GI tract was thrown off for a week. I called Gaucho and asked to speak to management. Spoke to manager Mike, told him the problem, told him to please check the burger batch and not feed that to any more customers as it was clearly contaminated. He assured me he would speak to chef and offered to get me a free meal to make up for it. I didn't expect that, but then he took my number and said he would call within the next few days to follow up. No call came. It's been 2 weeks. Don't make empty promises, especially when your customer was sickened by your food. This has left me very bitter to Gaucho. Enjoy the yummy tasting food but don't expect this place to do anything for you if you have a problem. And watch out for the burger!",

The steak came out to perfection and the sides were very good as well. They also server about 4-5 different meat sauces. These are probably the best part and take the meat to a whole different level! This place is kinda expensive so be prepared to spend a little. But it is totally worth it for-sure.   The building is small, but the food is good so I could understand why there was a long line when I arrived. They have a very nice setup that relied on mostly natural lighting. I like that they had l4 containers of spice next to the line so you could taste them. We had to wait about 30 minutes to get to the desk then about another 20-30 for the food. But it was worth the wait. I would suggest maybe googling this place to see when the least busiest times are and go then.",

They have four different sauces you can choose from, and we had a hard time picking which was our favorite (so we used them all, of course)! Additionally, the restaurant is BYOB, with no corkage fee which is a plus. The only downside was the wait to get in, since they dont take reservations. There was a steady line out the door the entire time we were there (from about 6 PM - 8 PM). The food is definitely worth the wait, and I cant wait to get back there to try out some of the other stuff on the menu.",

I swear their toast is made from God himself bc it is just that good. The next time I went I made sure to grab and extra order of toast. I've tried the sides of spaghetti squash, yams, and potatoes. Everything is amazing. There is so much flavor in everything they make and it is just all so amazing. I got the pulled pork the last time I was there and it was the best I had ever had in my LIFE. 10/10 for sure!",

After waiting 1.5 hours in line, we had a standoffish waiter who was rude, abrupt, and obnoxious (seated at 8:52 - see below for the rest  of timeline). Waiter's name is Patrick.  2. After finishing dinner, they didn't clear any plates and instead, basically put the bread putting dessert on top of the unfinished paella 3. They started putting chairs up on the empty tables around us at 9:30pm (this was a SATURDAY NIGHT FYI) 4. We asked for an extra chair for a friend who was coming to meet us for drinks (this was at 10:02 - remember that we got seated at 8:52), they said no - HERES THE WORST PART \"sorry we've been here for 8 hours and want to go home so we're locking the doors. No more guests allowed\". We then ask for the manager.  5. Manager refuses to come, waitress comes back and says \"sorry my manager supports me 100% and doesn't want to come up, sorry bye!\"",

See, the way it works is you order your food from the chalkboard and pay for it, collect your drinks, sit down and get served one time only. You have to walk around and find your own water and drinks but they still want a tip!   I ordered the Carne steak sandwich with roasted peppers and I chose sirloin meat. I ordered the side of rosemary garlic clove potatoes which I ate with my sandwich which boosted the flavor. Everything is slightly charred.  It was fun to try different styled food.",

A place like this, it's easy to focus on the meat and think you can get everything else somewhere else. I'm, no. Just do yourself a favor and order everything. And in case you're thinking, my eyes are bigger than my stomach, no, you're stomach will just need to make room. Favorites included the steak burger, carrots, and the chix empanadas. Fair point pricing on everything. I'd say pro tip, but it's more an obvious tip IMO, you want to try the four sauces that you pick up on your way to the table after ordering. Be prepared to pay probably wait a little to order due to lines out the door, but also be prepared for staff who are super friendly and helpful. Also, plan your visit accordingly; they are closed on Sundays and Mondays.",

We wanted to order empanadas as our appetizer but they only had 1 left at 7:45pm :( I got the Argentinio salad and it was huge. The papas (potatoes) were slightly hard but all the other vegetables were grilled nicely and served hot/warm over the salad.

Seeing how Gaucho is quite possibly top three restaurant in terms of Yelp popularity in Pittsburgh, I think it should be held to a higher standard. So here comes the truth:  Good -The energy is undeniable and the wait staff is pleasant, beyond helpful.  -This space is vast despite its deceiving outer appearance. -the smaller items on menu are exceptional. Take the whole \"smaller\" term with a grain of salt though. I'm not sure these guys know small....  The not so good -although the meat is plentiful, this isn't exactly Texas low n slow style. Tenderness matters, especially when it's this much packed in a sandwich!   Personally I feel where they excel is the sides and appetizers. Items like the empanadas or the roasted cauliflower are great. The cauliflower honestly is out of this world good.   Gaucho remains a formidable lunch option, with great value for your dollar. Just don't expect to have additional stomach space for dinner....",

    "text": "*HIGHLY RECOMMEND (Especially for steak lovers)*  This was rated one of the top 10 places to eat in the US according to Yelp a few years ago. Many people raved about it and I knew I had to try it out. I went here to celebrate one of my friend's birthday on a weekend. We were forewarned about the line and had to wait in line for about an hour. But was it worth it? YES. Everything was under $20 and for the amount and quality you get, it was definitely at a good price point. Service was great! The waiter gave us free dessert because he overheard us say it was our friend's birthday. I would go back again and try their famous paella that can feed like a whole family.  *DINNER*  We ordered 2 steak platters, one fish platter, 2 appetizer, and rosemary pulled pork sandwich. The rosemary pulled pork sandwich was sooo gooodd! It was juicy and fragrant. The steaks were all perfectly medium rare, and comes with a side of bread and salad. There were different dipping sauces to dip the steak in. The fish was tender. The yellow rice was standard and the corn was okay. Since this place is known for the steak, it definitely did not disappoint.   We ordered banana bread pudding and we got free cookies from the waiter. The bread pudding was good, but a bit too sweet for my liking. However my friend thought it was \"life changing\".",

They don't have parking and it can be a pain in the ass to find street parking. There are some parking lots nearby but they accept cash only.

It was a toss up for me between steak and salad. She recommended the salad with steak. What a novel idea!!  Why didn't I think of that?  So, I got the Argentio with medium rare steak. It was so good!  The steak was cooked just right and there where so many good flavors mixed together in the Argentio salad. I would go back again just for that.

I rolled in around 4pm and I gotta say there was hardly any wait. I was army table in about ten minutes and had my food about fifteen minutes later. But on walking in the staff was super friendly and I mean super super friendly. I had any questions they where sure to answer them and help me decide what to get being a first timer. The menu is pretty big and there seems like so many good options I wanted to get it all. I ended up settling on the sliced ribeye steak that was cooked to perfection with a perfect rare temperature. It was seasoned amazingly every bite was so juicy. It came paired with a salad and toast and it was all so fresh and the toast was such a great add on. I added on a side of potatoes and a veggie empanada and a beef one. The potato's where roasted with whole gloves of garlic and rosemary and sea salt it had so much flavor and the potatoes where the perfect softness not over cooked at all. The empanadas where good to but kinda small but they change them up regularly they said so that's a plus. They had a area where you could get different types of sauce in a little cup and all of them where so delicious but the red pepper one was by far my favorite. This place was everything I was hoping for plus more. I can't wait to return here again and try more of the menu. The staff and the food and the setting really just gave it that WOW factor.",

    "text": "I have been to Gaucho several times, and it's definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! I would recommend it to anyone visiting the area for the first time.  I love getting the steak sandwiches, but honestly anything is good here. As a side I would recommend the potatoes. One of the best parts of the Gaucho experience is the self-serve sauces they have. When I go with friends we usually have a good time talking about which is our favorite (I maintain that the ajo/garlic one is the best!). Sometimes when I'm extra hungry I even get some toast to eat with the sauce, but a sandwich or any other entree is usually more than enough. Prepare by going with an empty stomach!  Just one note of caution: lines can get very long. I have waited in a line for around 2 hours to get in on a Friday or Saturday night. If you want to get in quick I would recommend going for lunch on a weekday, but there still might be a bit of a line. It does go pretty quick though! On a similar note, they don't take reservations and their system is that they seat you after you order at the counter.",

    "text": "One of my fave places in PGH! I always recommend this whenever friends or coworkers ask about casual but quality food places to check out. The steaks here are REALLY GOOD! Make sure you get all the sauces they have (and take some home too :')) - full of lots of flavor. Gaucho gets packed superrrrr quickly - so either come here with a very small group (or by yourself, lol) or come at weird times, unless you're okay with waiting in line for almost an hour. I've seen lines wrap around this place in the dead of winter so.. you know its good. There's a decent amount of seating in the back (it's an order and sit-down place - but they will bring our your food for you and help clean up), but be sure to have a back-up plan in case it's crazy in there. Empanadas are alright, but what I come here for, is the steak + sauces and the roasted veggies! Go go go",

    "text": "So maybe you're wondering: \"What's all the fuss and why is there always a line around the block?\".  Do you like an exceptional meal that sticks out in your memory long after the last bite? So do all of those people in line. I promise, it's worth it, so get your spot in said line while you finish reading this review.  Gaucho is really first and foremost about the meat. I go for vegetarian options quite often, but I can't do that here. You only need to inhale the smoky, savory aroma that cloaks this establishment like an enchanted fog to get the idea. I've tried several sandwiches over the years, including the Chory Pan and the Pollo, but the Rosemary Braised Beef is legend, and I keep going back to it. It's a perfect combination of flavors; notably, the marriage of rosemary and horseradish sauce. On my last visit, I finally tried their empanadas and Humita (corn pudding). Delightful, although I still stand by the sandwiches.  Pro Tip (ha!) - Go at an off time! I've gone either right at 11AM or between 2 and 4, and the wait is incredibly shorter. Just have an early or late lunch; let me reiterate, it is SO worth it!",

    "text": "Yes! Finally, I got to take someone here. I do not know why but whenever anyone visits this is my go to suggestion AND yet people sometimes say no because of the wait. Let me tell you each and every minute I wait is worth it. My aunt and uncle were in town for the baseball game (btw we won) and I suggested we go here. We were already in the Strip District so they said ok. We walked in and they were just wide-eyed gaping at the menu not knowing what to try or where to even start. They kept on saying, wow it smell good. There was no wait, miracle!, and we got a table right in front. I got us each of the dips and sat waiting for our food to come and them to be amazed.   Accompanamientos: Maiz: Grilled Corn on the Cob: It was amazing as usual. I talked my aunt into getting one with me. She bit into it just saying, wow...that is good. It was sweet and grilled to perfection. Each time I get this corn there is nothing that I would add to it at all. My aunt added one of the sauces, or maybe a bit of all the sauces, to hers and really seemed to enjoy that mixture.   Pequenos: Provoletta: Sharp provolone grilled with arugula, lemon, and olives on toast.: I did not order this my aunt did for her main course. She said that it was almost too much cheese (if that is even a real complaint) but it was grilled to perfection. She also realized after this dish that she like arugula. It looked good. It was a nice thick slab of cheese on their toasted bread. i loved the look of it and would love to try it on another visit.   Con pan: Pescado:Fish of the day w/ lettuces, lemon, and caramelized onion:  This is my jam. I get this all the time even though I always want to try new things. It is just so good. The onions are just perfection. Smokey and soft with the hint of the grill in them. The tilapia just grilled so that it flakes off in your mouth but stays together in the sandwich. The lettuce is abundant and so when things fall off the sandwich you also have a little side salad to go with it. The bread is just the best. Light and crusty....yummmmm. I would eat this everyday.   Exclusivos: Cerdo: Pork tenderloin, caramelized onion, and spicy mustard. Served with a small casa salad and tostado: At the last minute after much back and forth my uncle decided on the LARGE plate of the cerdo. It was a mountain of pork. He got it and when he looked at the plate just goes, maybe I should have gone with the small. He said the meat was great and the side of spicy mustard was just the right kick to make the plate amazing. He really loved it.   I always enjoy showing and bringing people to some of my favorite places around the 'burg. I love it even more when the people love the places we get to try. I am so happy they had a great time and can not wait to go back.",

Ok maybe the fact that i was starving when we got there on our road trip past Pittsburgh contributed a half star but nevertheless one of most memorable restaurants I've been to. My wife a I shared the Parrillada Mixata that included a choice of steak (we tried NY), spicy chorizo, bbq chicken and toasts. We also tried the chicken and beef empenadas. Everything was amazing! The portions were generous and enough for the two of us. The sauces couldn't be any better. Specially the smoked pepper sauce. The service was great and the staff were super friendly and attentive. We were lucky that we got there a bit early for dinner but there was a huge line for dinner by the time we left. The prices were also very reasonable. Overall i wanna go back to Pittsburgh just to go to Gaucho Parrilla Argentina.   Food: 6/5 Service and atmosphere: 5/5 Price: 5/5  Overall: 5/5",

I would almost always choose chorizo over beef in any circumstances, but the balance of flavor was better in the beef empanada - El Gaucho salad with steak added: I highly enjoyed each bite of this salad that contained radish, asparagus, bunch of leafy greens, carrot strips, and avocado, tossed in a light dressing. One bite of medium rare (or whatever other shape or form you like your meat) steak followed by a massive bite of vegetables made me feel much proud of myself for eating veggies because I actually really would never pay money to buy myself a salad. But this one was worth it.  - Sauces: try all the sauces and put it on everything whether it's empanada, steak, your fork, or whatever. Find out which sauce speaks to you the most and discuss it with your company for meaningful conversations.   If I come here another time, and everything tastes consistently amazing, I will upgrade my rating to a five-star.  Oh, and BYOB.",

A big line awaits you when you walk in and it is not the people who are waiting to be seated but they are also placing their orders. You can order your meal and beverages at the check in counter and pay for it too. The waitress will get you and find a seat. Then someone will bring in your food and serve it at your table.   Now I liked most of my experience but when you are looking for any service at your table, you would barely get any. Probably because I was there between 8 and 9, I don't know. The food was very good, I ordered small plate of camarones (shrimp), veggie empanadas and chicken sandwich. Their sauces are a must try!

    "text": "Gaucho is well worth the hype. I visited after a friend spent an entire day telling me how great this place was. I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Our first attempt at getting into Gaucho's was on a Friday night, and we were already a little late to the party. The line can be fairly long, and the restaurant isn't a big place, so the wait can get a little lengthy and daunting. We had places to be that night, so we decided to come back the next day for lunch. We made sure to get there early and got a reasonable spot in line.   Drinks are the first things ordered and you get them while waiting in line shortly before you order food and pay. There are 2 options for seating, indoors and in a small outdoors area immediately outside. We opted for the outdoors spot since it was a nice day, and it was great. My friend and I ordered the carne sandwich (with filet, medium rare), a ribeye plate, empanadas, and grilled corn. We were hungry.   Carne sandwich: 5/5. The meat was amazingly cooked, tender and flavorful. The ciabatta bread adds significantly to the sandwich, I'm pretty sure it would not be as good with any other type of bread. The chimichurri sauce complemented the meat nicely, and the array of sauces that are available inside all tasted great on top of the sandwich.   Ribeye plate: 5/5. The meat again was top notch. The toast was nicely done, not too dry and not too rough to eat. Plenty of flavor to add to the plate. The salad was a typical salad but was an appropriate amount to combine with the remainder of the dish.  Empanadas: 5/5. We ordered the beef and chicken empanadas. The empanadas are reasonably priced and very nicely done. The shell is toasted to a nice crisp that is also easy to bite through. The empanadas were packed, and were certainly a good portion. All of the contents tasted great.   Corn: 4/5. Corn was lightly grilled and appropriately buttered. Great flavor, but not anything out of this world.   Even though we were outdoors and somewhat secluded, waiters made sure to find their way to our table to refill drinks and make sure everything was tasting good. Service was excellent. The only issue with this restaurant is the possibility of a long wait, however that seems to be a growing problem at all great restaurants. If you come a little early, the wait shouldn't be too bad. The parking options around here are reasonable and we found parking 1-2 blocks away.   Definitely recommend coming here!! I would have come back the next day however they are sadly closed on Sunday.",

Perfection is their filet sandwich: expertly-grilled filet complemented with smoky, slightly-charred vegetables, all piled onto lightly toasted bread that's sturdy enough to hold everything together yet delicate enough to let the ingredients shine. An array of available sauces creates an impossible, delicious dilemma; the only rational solution is having some of each.   This is the sandwich of my dreams.",

Every single time I do, it's amazing.  Flavorful, perfectly cooked beef? Check. Amazing, succulent chicken? Check. Delicious and abundant sides? Check.  It's always crowded but they have a nice seating area in the back now (they've expanded) and they have an equally nice patio seating area during nice weather. Some might consider it expensive when compared to other lunch or dinner dining options in the area (there's a $5 delicious pho joint right down the street,) but MAN do you get what you pay for.   Go there. If the line is around the corner, which is often is, wait in it patiently. You will be rewarded with tasty meat treats.",

We also got the New York steak which was perfectly medium rare and mouth-watering. So good! I can't say much about the veggies because we pretty much just ate lots of meat. Mmmhhh meeaaat.   Only down side to this place is that it's very small. I would suggest getting things to go, but if you want a homey experience, dine in. Just don't go with more than 4 people, I think they have 4 chairs total :P The owners are amazingly kind though, so they don't mind people squeezing in.   Final tip: go before 6pm!!! They close at 7pm and I swear everyone and their mom goes between 6-7pm, it's so funny! Not sure why this is the case, but we beat the crowd because we're pros. Be a pro, you'll get your food faster! :)",

Hanger is probably my favorite, but it's hard to go wrong.   With apologies to Gaucho I would recommend a fattier cut of meat than the filet simply because of how outstanding the flavors are on all of the dishes and sauces. Filet stands well alone and while fantastic the flavors feel less impressive on that cut.  You can not go wrong here though. Get creative and push your boundaries, you are in excellent hands at Gaucho.  Finally, try the rosemary short rib sandwich at least once  before you lay down for the dirt nap.  The line looks more daunting than it really is. Once you order and pay, your food is typically out within 10 minutes (at most), compared to conventional restaurant where you wait at your table.",

The only thing I didn't care for was the soggy bun, it didn't really matter that much once I bit into the delicious sandwich, that had ribeye steak, caramelized onions and roasted red peppers with chimmichuri sauce. One recommendation would be to cut the meat against then grain, then when your biting into the sandwich you don't pull whole chunks of ribeye out and have to pick up with your fingers. With that being said, yummy and I will be back :)",

My only complaints (not really complaints) are that it is always so packed and the wait is forever, but that is expected in a place that has such great and unique food in this area.  The other is that they don't serve alcohol, which is not a huge drawback but if they did, then no one would EVER leave!  And the lines would only grow longer.  PLEASE open another one in the South Hills!!    Try this place...you will not be disappointed.  Something for everyone.",

    "text": "Hands down the best place to eat in Pittsburgh. Just the sauces alone are enough to give 5 stars for. I have been known to eat the Chimichurri sauce by itself while waiting for my food. The wait is well worth it. The wood-fire flavor is out of this world and it seeps into every food that they serve. The roasted veggies are to die for and a must to order as a side. The steak sandwich is a classic and so filling. I can hardly ever finish the whole thing but still order sides because I just can't resist.   Finally, the star of the show: THE PAELLA! I lived in Spain for some time and it's the closest I've experienced in the states to authentic paella. It's cooked in the traditional cast-iron skillet so it gets that charred, crunchy rice at the bottom that I have bene missing. Truly worth it.   And the price just can't be beat. For such an outstanding, renown and acclaimed restaurant, it astounds me that they haven't raised their prices. I myself can eat there (and feel like I don't need to eat for days) for $15. And for a group of four adults, we got an order of steak (that came with a side salad and grilled bread), four pieces of corn, an order of the veggies, an order of the wings and the $50 paella and our entire bill came to just $99. And we had leftovers! It was fantastic. Plus, the fact that it's BYOB makes it even better.   The only set back is that you can't sit and bask in the glory of your food coma because there are so many people waiting for a table. But it's honestly part of the experience.   Just remember to tip the staff too! They work so hard and the service is great. Just because it's not your typical sit down service doesn't mean they shouldn't get some cash thrown into the tip jar at the register. The whole staff (including the kitchen) shares the tips, and that's always been something I've appreciated in an establishment.",

This was my first stop. I found myself waiting on line for about 30 minutes, which I had been giving warning, but about 29 minutes of that time was spent in DEEP THOUGHT over what delicacy I would eat. I went with the NY Strip steak sandwich and at the friendly, hip cashier's suggestion, the rosemary potatoes as a side rather than the pork empanadas. I ate happily alone at counter, feeling not at all alone and more so openly welcome by the wait staff. All I have to say to end this review is that my food tour ended at this first stop. This was one of the best meals of my life.",

I always get either the small Bife de Gaucho or the steak sandwich with filet. They are cooked SO beautifully each time I order them. My favorite sauce is the onion-y one that I can't seem to remember the name of. Of course, if their corn on the cob is an option, you definitely need to have that in your life!!  Their BYO policy is wonderful and I really like the new system of how they seat you vs. letting you seat yourself.  I also recently had the pleasure of having their Asado truck at a friend's event, and the quality of the food was just as on point. They are killing the game right now!!",

The flow of the restaurant is the only reason it's not getting 5 stars: you order at a counter that's right by the front, clogging up the entrance and almost always causing a line out the door.  But I will always wait in the line because it really speaks for the delicious food, great ambiance and super friendly staff. Extremely authentic, Argentinian food means tons of grilled meats, veggies and some of the best empanadas in town. The fact that it's BYOB just tops of the reasons why you should definitely make your way over the Gaucho!",

And then when we finally got there, he looked at us and said, \"Well, there's people inside.\" We got out, looked around with some trepidation (as we're not city dwellers), shrugged our shoulders and decided to go for it, and I'm so glad we did!  The place just smelled amazing, and we were really hungry! I finally settled on a salad with rib eye steak. I would have liked less fat on the steak, but it was super flavorful and a perfect compliment to the salad, which had yummy roasted/grilled veggies.  We didn't realize that it was close to closing time, so they were running out of things like bread and sweet potatoes, which was bad for anyone who wanted a sandwich. I was impressed with how friendly the cashier guy was, even at the end of the day. He calmly and patiently explained the menu to newcomers (like us!). There's hardly any seating, so we were lucky to grab some seats as people left.  The kitchen is open, and they keep the wood piled up in the front area, so you can see them cooking/making your food. I was thrilled to watch my salad being made oh-so-carefully by a very cute guy.  We were the last patrons as they closed up for the day. They were kind enough to call a taxi for us, and when we left, the chef and his staff said thanks and goodbye as they stood outside smoking their cigarettes.",

    "text": "I was in town visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and yelped a bunch of places, and of course, Gaucho popped up with its 5-star rating.  Pros: I did really like the ribeye sandwich! After reading many Yelp reviews about it, I decided it was worth a try.   Cons: Everything else was pretty mediocre. We got the grilled veggie plate, side order of potatoes, rosemary braised beef sandwich, NY strip plate and the fish of the day plate. The rosemary braised beef sandwich was nothing compared to the ribeye sandwich. The potatotes and grilled veggies were soaked in oil, as was most of the food. There was so much char on most of the meat, and it wasn't anything special anyway. The fish was good, but nothing spectacular. There was a huge long line and we had to wait about 40 minutes until we actually got to eat.   Overall: I came to Gaucho with high hopes, but left pretty disappointed. Don't get me wrong, the food is not terribly BAD, but it's not worth the hype. I'm surprised that this place has a 5-star rating, is this the best Pittsburgh has to offer?",

Everything I ordered was delicious and would recommend. Super clean and very friendly staff. You do order first and then sit so keep that in mind. They bring your food out and they have pseudo waiters that clean up your plates which is nice. Tipping apparently is at the beginning as well. Little different but whatever... everyone seems to be putting a little different spin on how things work these days. I got up and refilled my water as I needed and if your boozing it's BYOB, otherwise they have some pop and some other non-etoh options.",

    "text": "I've so looked forward to writing this review. Not that writing Yelp reviews is something I daydream about on a regular basis, rather it would mean I had finally tasted the deliciousness that is Gaucho Parilla Argentina and pretty much gone to carnivore heaven. That is precisely what happened!   My friend and I talked about coming here for months, but one thing or another kept preventing it. Yesterday we decided to make it happen. I read in some reviews that getting food can take time if it's busy, so I arrived before he did and put in our orders with the friendly and helpful staff at the counter. I loved the open, airy feel of the place and the easygoing rapport up front that the staff created. I also appreciated how the staff dressed and looked more like themselves and less like a traditional army of servers who all look the same. It was one of the most refreshing restaurants I've ever been in for that reason alone.   I made my way to the quieter back section of the restaurant and chose one of the lower center tables. There was sufficient room for the amount of space without feeling like other patrons were all up in your business. The room was also sunny, a huge plus! My friend and the food arrived soon afterwards, and we began to eat.  Wanting to sample several meats we went with the mixed grill, which has steak, chicken, and chorizo. On the side we had two orders of potatoes, an extra order of toast, and all four sauces. I can't choose a favorite meat, because they were all utterly divine! The steak and chicken were so tender they pulled apart easily without a knife, and the chorizo had a satisfying snap to it as well as a spicy flavor that I loved immediately. The potatoes were roasted until crispy on the outside, and the toast was chewy perfection. My favorite sauce was difficult to choose, but I would have to say the thinner green one edged ahead slightly for me. I tasted an interesting sour note that complimented literally everything on the table. We ate everything but a few potatoes, and with two Mexican cokes the $40 bill seemed like a steal for the caliber of food we had just consumed. Gaucho exceeded my (incredibly high) expectations, and I can't wait to come back and share the steak platter I've had my eye on and try some of the different vegetables. Gaucho, you're incredible!",

So yea - the place is VERY good.  The menu pretty much has anything you can think of from chicken, beef, pork, & fresh fish prepared in a multitude of ways... & they even will do special request orders if you don't see exactly what you want on their menu - WHAT???!!! :) Some downers, LLLOOOOONNNNGGGG line to order & to get your food. Very tightly spaced place inside & a lil more open in their tiny patio but not by much... so be ready to get your food to go & go.  Some helpful pointers, CALL in advance to place your order (especially if to go) & you get I think a 10% off.. so that's really nice, HOWEVER; because they are SO busy - don't expect them to answer right away -- you may have to leave a message to get a call back or keep trying til you get thru... so yea - did I mention they're busy??? :) In all in all - it's worth it  - the food is excellent & I enjoy it immensely.",

One word to describe the food would be \"DRY\" The steak was chewy (I ordered medium rare and it came well done), the chorizo was rubbery and the chicken well flavored with the garlic sauce was also dry).  We also ordered the Arrechera platter (flank steak). I ordered it medium and it came out burnt. I had to cut all the outside, so I didn't  have to taste the bitterness. On the positive side, the salad was delicious and fresh. The Chorypan was good. Extremely overrated place, or the kitchen had a bad day.",

What made this place a no-brainer to go to was the consistent 5 star ratings. Yes, my decision was done Gaucho P, it was. I was not disappointed, i wasn't going to drive 45 mins to the strip and then order a sandwich, i went big and ordered the Asada Platter, which is more than a generous portion of 5 cuts of meats, grilled and seasoned to perfection. I ordered it to go. They were out of empanadas or as they said their machine was broken. The selections the seasoning the chimmichurri sauces that i scooped up fantastic.

Chicken, pork, beef, shrimp, all go on the grill with herbaceous and flavorful sauces. I ordered the spicy chorizo, shrimp, and empanadas, and everything I had was delicious.

    "text": "In my opinion, this is good food, but not worth the insane wait times. Most frustrating about those long lines is that (a) in Pittsburgh there is about a 90% chance it's raining at any given moment, so chances are you are standing in line in the rain, and (b) there is really no discernible reason the line is THAT long except that the kitchen is just sort of slow.  All that said, the steak is really tasty, and very affordable for the quality. Potatoes make a great side, and the sauce (chimichurri in particular) go great with everything else.",

    "text": "Amazing restaurant with plentiful vegetarian options - at the top of my list of favorite Pittsburgh restaurants!  I normally get 2 empanadas (3 daily types of empanadas, with one of them always being vegetarian) and the Vegetale sandwich. As I am not a huge fan of mushrooms, I usually request that provolone cheese be used to replace the mushrooms in the sandwich, which the employees are always happy to oblige with, with no hassle or extra cost. Keep a look out for the seasonal pasta special as well, a good mix of tangy aioli sauce and vegetables. Also, the condiment sauces are to die for! Be sure to use these generously with any entree you order.  BYOB. I'd recommend going at off peak hours (for example, 5 PM for early dinners) to ensure the line does not get too long (since they don't take reservations).",

    "text": "Lucked at and didn't have to wait long for the deliciousness that is Gaucho. I had my usual small flank steak. It's served with carmelized onions (delicious), salad and a piece of toast. The small is plenty for a meal.   My husband had the condero, which is smoked leg of lamb. He thought it was going to be lamb served how the steak is served, but it was actually more like a stew. Nonetheless, he seemed to enjoy it. Also served with a salad and a side. The side was a marinated eggplant salad served cold. I enjoyed it.  We also ordered two empanadas, one beef and one pork. The empanadas rotate regularly. They're small, but good. And the filling to dough ratio is near perfect (a little heavier on the dough).   Also love the selection of help yourself salsas and chimmis to accompany your meal. My go-tos are the garlic sauce and the chimmi.   I'm always impressed at how they manage the customer to table ratio. Maybe I've just been there at the right time, but we've never had a probably getting a table (after waiting to order our food, of course) and we've never felt rushed.",

This was especially evident when they didn't kick people out who had been lingering there for hours without ordering more food. This is a BYOB place. They do not make money from liquor sales. As a result, they have to turn over tables at a rather efficient rate. It was shocking to me how entitled bourgeois drunk people are so inappropriate to such a lovely staff. You can put a saddle on a jackass but it doesn't make it a racehorse. Bravo to you staff of Gaucho!",

    "text": "Classic spot to feed your inner Carnivore. One of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh. Great place for dates or groups, possibly even special occasions (i.e. family dinner over graduation).   My one annoyance is the loooong wait and cramped waiting area during busy times... The line will be outside wrapped around the corner. For example: Arrived on a Saturday at 8 PM and probably waited for an hour +. They don't take reservations unfortunately. HOWEVER, if you're willing to wait it out, it's completely WORTH it.   Gaucho delivers on the best beef, sauces, and other specialties (shrimp, pork, sides, etc). You can order plates or sandwiches. Seriously an overwhelming number of options. I've found that for two people, ordering two small plates and a side (potatoes, green beans, etc) is the perfect size to split and leave with a full belly. I recently split the Cerdo (roast pork), small plate of NY strip (median rare), and side of potatoes.  ALL delicious. The strip was perfectly pink / red. The pork wasn't dry but tender and flavorful. The Camarones (shrimp plate) and Carne Sandwich are both equally worthy. I have nothing negative to say in regards to the quality of food here. Out of the sauces (which are a must have regardless of your order), I obsess over the Ajo-Garlic (roasted garlic) and classic Chimmichurri-Yummy (Argentinian steak sauce).  BYOB",

    "text": "So unbelievably good!  I had been to their previous location and loved the food, but the space was beyond small making getting your food to go the only viable option.   I was super excited to return once I learned that they had moved a couple doors down into a much larger space with two floors worth of seating, but every time I tried to get there the line to get in was literally around the block. The day we went there was actually no wait so we hurried up and parked and made a beeline to the door.  Once inside I was not only blown away by how much nicer the new space was, but by how much was added to the menu since we visited the original location. After about 10 minutes of staring at the menu board we were ready to order.  I chose a Carne ribeye steak sandwich which features your choice of steak with chimmichurri sauce, grilled peppers and caramelized onions. My steak was cooked perfectly. The steak was tender, very juicy and full of flavor. My wife chose the Pollo sandwich which features grilled chicken, pickled red onions, portobello mushrooms and ajo sauce. She absolutely loved it. Our daughter chose the steak burger which features a half pound burger, chimmichurri sauce and your choice of two topping. She added bacon and blue cheese. She loved her burger as well.  One thing that I have always loved about Gaucho is that they have always cooked whatever meat I have order just as I ask. It is so hard to get perfectly cooked meat now a days, unfortunately. Service was quick and very attentive. I also like the fact that there is an exit door on the second floor that makes it easy to avoid the line of waiting people downstairs when you are ready to leave.  Be sure to try each of their four sauces. Chimmichurri \"Argentine Steak Sauce\" which has fresh parsley and oregano, garlic, pepper flakes, red wine vinegar and olive oil. Ajo which has roasted garlic cloves with caramelized onions, parsley and pepper with olive oil. Pimenton which has grilled red bell peppers, fresh garlic, parsley, vinegar and olive oil. And Cebolla which has caramelized onion, vinegar, olive oil and parsley. Each sauce is very unique and different and all worth trying.",

We  were prepared for a long wait so we arrived early (and not hungry yet) on a Saturday night. We arrived around 4:45p and the wait was about an hour. Not bad and totally worth it - would have been a lot worse if we arrived famished !  Staff was nice and handed out waters to the line as we waited. My hubby and I  ordered the asado platter -- 5 cuts of meats, and the grilled vegetable plate. We just split both and it was the perfect amount and we loved that we got to try a bit of all cuts of steak they offer!  Amazing amazing amazing. And the four chimichurri sauces were the icing on the top of the cake. We will absolutely be back! We would love to see another gaucho location pop up in Pittsburgh so the wait times could decrease!! But 5/5 none the less !",

You KNOW it's gonna be good. We went at 4 and the line was still very long. But it got even longer as the night went on. But anyways for the food, I order the filet mignon, medium, and it was probably the best steak I've EVER had. They made it sooooo good. The outside of the steak had a nice char to it, but the middle had just enough pink. And it was just filled with juice. It was so freaking good. The salad that came with it was delicious. It was very fresh! And ya know how some salads are chewy when they use real greens, well this one wasn't! It was very light and tasty and just great. I also ordered the carrots with goat cheese, and omg. These were sooooo good. Idk where they get their cheese but holy crap. So good. It was like a dessert. And I also ordered an empanada and that was also delicious. But so if your deciding if you want to wait it out in that huge line, just do it!!",

    "text": "Honestly... worth the wait. My husband said the wait is the only thing he'd take stars off for, but he hates waiting more than 15 mins for anything so   The warnings about the line are real - expect to wait at least 20-30 minutes. We came on Cinco de Mayo weekend by accident (and this area of Pittsburgh has a weekend market going on, anyways) so parking was rough and the line was already winding around the building. We still only waited a little over 45 minutes, though, so I'd call that a win.   The prices are fair, especially for the amount of food that you get, but it's my opinion that you should skip the platters and just go for the sandwiches. Would maybe change my mind if I got the asada platter or the paella, but those are things I'd get only with a hungry group of friends. For just me, the steak sandwich + some empanadas are more than enough. Speaking of which, I want to shout out the empanadas... I've never had Argentinian empanadas and was expecting the Mexican masa variety, but these are more of a bread dough and almost more like an Asian bao?? Super good and wish we got more (at first, I was a little underwhelmed by how small they seemed, but with the bready dough and dense filling, they were the right amount of filling).   Also, big ups to the sauces... all of them are great, but the standouts are the chimmichuri (obviously previously raved about) and the smoked pepper. Honestly would have taken more to go if I wasn't so worried about little sauce containers spilling in my car.   Overall, great experience that genuinely feels local and warm. The service is great - efficient and used to dealing with crowds (love that they find your group tables so no one can hog/reserve more space than necessary) and extremely friendly. Looking forward to coming back (hopefully with a shorter line) and trying more on the menu!",

The food and service are amazing and well worth the wait! BUT, if you can get there right when the restaurant opens or go during the week you can avoid the lines.  I always get the Bondiola... roasted pork sandwich with a mustard sauce and caramelized onions. AMAZING! The bread is incredible...  My wife got the El Gaucho Salad with chicken added. She also gets QuiQui Rimichi sauce on the side. DELICIOUS!  BYOB!!  You won't be disappointed!!",

Just make sure you choose the time wisely. The hype is real and there will be a line. It does go fast though given the ordering set up.   I've dined at Gaucho twice now. The first time was in the summer when they had the shrimp and grilled veggies on the menu. This recent time I decided to get the carne sandwich and campfire yams. I have never ordered something I didn't like here. If you love yams, I highly recommend the campfire yams. I felt like I was out in the woods eating roasted marshmallows! Such a perfect fall dish. The sandwich was bigger than I expected which is why I cut it in half and made two meals out of it. You have your choice of meats and I picked the flank steak for my sandwich. Also, do not skip out on the sauces. They take your already delicious meal to the next level.",

The food is always cooked to perfection and the ingredients are so FRESH!! EVERYONE - from those that assist you in finding a seat, to those that take your order, to those that act as severs - is SO friendly and accommodating!! We took my dad to Gaucho tonight to celebrate his birthday (he loves it there and always requests it) and, of course, it was a great experience. We brought a cake and they kept it in the fridge for us during dinner and then brought it out with a candle and sang Happy Birthday (I did not ask them to do that, they just did )  I have never had a bad meal at Gaucho!! Some of our favorites include the Qui Qui Chicken appetizer, the steak burger, the rosemary braised beef sandwich and the salads are AMAZING!!! So fresh and delicious!!  The only drawback to Gaucho is that they don't take reservations, so you may have to wait in line. We try to go at \"off\" times to avoid the line, but the food is DEFINITELY worth the wait if you must stand in line.  They have a great system in place and run like a well-oiled machine, though, so your wait will not be unpleasant in the least.  If you have never been there, RUN, don't walk!! I promise you will be glad you did!!",

    "text": "The food here is a 5 so I'll start with that.   We started with the picada, which was a huge portion for an appetizer. It was enough for my husband and I to have it as an appetizer for two days. The picada included Serrano ham, Iberico Chorizo, provolone, cabrales (which is another word for amazing blue cheese), dulce de membrillo (which is another name for pear paste - I don't like pear, but thought it was tasty), marinated olives (green and kalamata type olives), toasted almonds and ciabatta toast. We love charcuterie plates and this was by far the best.   Next we shared the carne sandwich with flank steak. Originally, we were going to get either sirloin or skirt steak. Then I asked which steak would be the most tender and flavorful. A man who worked there said the flank steak would be the best for what I described. So happy we took his recommendation. It was delicious and made even better when I added chimichurri and some of the cabrales (blue cheese) from the picada. Absolutely delicious! We'd order both again in a heartbeat.   Now to the reason why I gave them 1 star less. Their ordering system is a disaster. There is always one person on the register who barely wants to be there. There may or may not be someone else there watching the giant line but not jumping on the second register. Then there is a girl giving out drinks. I think her time would be better spent on the second register ringing people up. There was a woman who took you to your table. Again this seems silly. Why can't she ring the second register and let people find their own seats? There were lots of them. It would be so much better if they just had table service. Then there is the crazy list of rules outside.   If you can deal with the dumb ordering process and waiting forever to get to the one person ringing the register, the food is so worth it.   You can also call ahead and come in for takeout. You can't eat there after though.",

    "text": "Came here for late brunch on a Friday. Our party of 10 was able to find seating quickly. We ordered everything from paella, sirloin steak, steak sandwiches, potato sides, and chorizo sampler dish. Everything was cooked very well. Meats were tender, juicy and well flavored. Potatoes had a nice garlic and thyme herb roasted taste to them. The salads had a variety of spinach and other greens your not limited to just ice burg lettuce.  Paella took about 30 minutes to prepare. Feeds around 5-8 people. They put plenty of sausage, chicken, mussels, shrimp, and clams in this dish. Shrimp was a lil overcooked and rice should've been cooked for another 5 minutes. Rice still had a lil of the hard texture to it.  One of my friends who lives in the area recommended this place and we were surprised we got seated quickly. They have a sauce and silver ware station. Sauce here is everything. They have this roasted pepper, chimichurri and pesto type sauce that everyone needs to try. It's so good that you need to try different combinations on all of your food. Everything seems to be self service, but the kind waiters do come out to clear plates, refill drinks and check in on you.  Highly recommend this place if your a big meat person and enjoy Argentinian dishes. Portions are reasonable, food is priced fairly and you get quality ingredients here. There is plenty of street parking in the area. I do hear the place can get crowded so expect a wait. Parties are first come first serve and you can't reserve seats",

Stood in the line the meandered along the length of the building, on a narrow baking hot concrete sidewalk, directly abutting the tarmac street. Hostess wouldn't commit to how long of a wait, with a canned response for each who asked. Many rules to follow, explicitly stated along your route (aka, Seinfeld soup nazi). As you reach indoors, the highlight of the experience is a large lobby with views of attached kitchen and a large wall-sized board describing a multitude of culinary options. Many varieties of steaks, poultry and fish options. Helpful diagrams of how they cook their meats. Views of the kitchen as you order your food in the cafeteria line is entertaining. Very friendly cashiers. Wait for them to seat you.   Entering the dining area a bit of a letdown. Nondescript smallish and visually isolated back room that feels half basic coffee shop / half small town airport fast food sit down. Mix of recycled 80's and 90's office tables and chairs with seemingly little thought put into the room. The procession up to and including ordering is obviously the focus.   Had the 6 oz filet mignon ($23) with a roasted potato side ($3). Steak was sliced, decent but not spectacular, with a roasted garlic salad side.  Various dipping sauces. Finished with a tart and coffee for dessert.   As we left, passing the others anxiously waiting to place their order, and seeing how quickly visitors cycle through once they get seated, I could tell you exactly how long of a wait to expect for a given line length. Enjoyable experience, but for our group of 4, thinking not standing up to the hype.",

First, the wood-fired oven they use (so the type of wood, and the high temp), and the freshness of the meat (which is all from regional providers). Beyond the meat, ALL of the ingredients were so fresh, and such high quality, that you wonder how the prices on the menu aren't higher.   Everything we had: empanadas, provoletta, chicken sandwich, and the gaucho platter were divine. Of course, their four housemade sauces are seemingly made by the hands of angels). My 3-year old niece begged us each day after to take her back here. This place could be a Paleo Paradise, but the bread is so so so good (from a local bakery, can't recall which one) that you're going to go all-in on the carbs. This is one of those times when each bite you take, you have a foodgasm (and you--perhaps awkwardly note--that everyone around you is experiencing the same thing).   Not cheap by any means, but you're getting top-quality food prepared with expert precision, so worth every penny. Highly recommended.",

The pork chop, was cooked well nothing to rant or rave about, empanadas have a firm texture which felt like they had been overcooked a little, the vegetable filling was nothing crazy, but the pork filling was really good.

    "text": "AMAZING! This one word describes it all.  This is a small joint located right before the market strip. Although underwhelming on the outside, the food offered inside was absolutely delicious.   The one thing that could've  used improvement that the great food made up for was definitely the service. Although the lady who took our order was not entirely rude, she wasn't the most helpful or friendly either. We were trying to get her opinion on what to order but she sort of gave us the \"arms up\" attitude and claimed it was all good. As there was a lot of items on the menu it was hard to decide. Everything was also written in Spanish so you really had to read the descriptions to know what you're getting yourself into especially if you don't know Spanish.   We ended up ordering a Rosemary braised beef sandwich, pork tenderloin with caramelized mushrooms and onions, a side of roasted potatoes and two empanadas to start. All of these items were absolutely to die for. The beef brisket sandwich came with a horse radish sauce that elevated the flavour to another level. The pork was so juicy and tender it practically melted in our mouths. Even the roasted potatoes were packed with flavour leaving no tastebuds behind! Our empanadas were also a great way to start our meal because the beef inside them was well seasoned and perfectly balanced.   During our meal one of the kitchen staff also came to ask us how our meal was and that definitely redeemed the initial service we had. Especially considering the layout of this restaurant is small and offers limited seating that is first come first serve with a order and bring your food to the table kind of vibe.   This place definitely knows their meat and they offer great flavours. If you're ever in town or have been thinking of making a visit. JUST DO IT. You won't regret it.",

    "text": "I had lunch at Gaucho's today. Let's get the cold prickly's out of the way first:   This place is small. There are 6 uncomfortable stools with very limited counter space and it gets really crowded in that cramp space.  Not a very good place to go if you're looking for a nice sitdown meal.   It's also pretty expensive as far as a lunch sandwich goes.  My sandwich set me back $12.83... No sides, no drink.   Lastly, it's a bit of a hike if you work in town. To get here from town you would be walking past a number of other pretty good and much more comfortable eateries just to get here. And if you planned on take out, your sandwich would be cold by the time you walked back to you desk.   Now on to the \"warm fuzzies\":  The sandwich I had was unbelievably good! Quite possibly the very best sandwich in the Burg. I got the Carne with ribeye steak. It was a generous serving of real ribeye steak right off of the grill, not some shaved imposter.   I'm a bit shy when it comes to ordering steak when I go out.  I like mine well done and most places can't seem to comprehend what \"well done\" means.  This ribeye was grilled to perfection; no pink on the inside, no char on the outside. It was brown all the way through while still retaining its juiciness.  Topping the sandwich off was chimmi, caramelized onion & pepper all between a lightly toasted bun. Perfection!!! Well worth every penny I spent on it.   I was lucky enough to snag one of the six stools and enjoy my sandwich as soon as it came off the grill and while it was still warm.  If it weren't for the cramped and limited seating I'd give this place a five star rating. Unfortunately the accommodations knocked it down a notch.  *** NOTE (3/12/2015) ***  As Lisa G. mentioned in her review of Goucho's, they are planning on expanding their restaurant to include better seating accommodations.  I'm looking forward to the new and improved Goucho's... Thanks for addressing that Lisa!",

    "text": "First off, the trick with Gaucho is to order in advance, then skip the wait, walk and grab your food, and then hustle down to whatever apartment you call home and enjoy the delish. On my second night in Pittsburgh, my dad and I walked the 16th St. bridge after unpacking and proceeded to wait in line for just under two hours. After about an hour, we noticed that people were able to walk in, skip the line, and grab pre-ordered food to go and we looked at each other solemnly.  I have eaten at many good restaurants in some wonderful and underappreciated cities in my time. None of them, including Gaucho, is worth a two hour wait in line. Would I wait 30 minutes? Yes. The food IS good, but at some point the waiting time supersedes quality food. To be fair, the service staff and cooks do a great job of pushing the line and balancing between encouraging finished diners to depart while also giving you good service.  Regarding the food, it is very good like I said. The sandwiches are underwhelming though and need to be complimented with any of the wonderful sides. Personally, if I want some meat, I go with the wings now. They are sizeable, perfectly grilled, and have a delightful zest to them with fairly complex flavors. They are quite nice.  Many people love the grilled vegetables, but as someone who grills veggies at home with regularity, I don't see much difference. I do recommend the Papas Dulce and Fungos though.   The sauces are good, but again, waiting in line for two hours to order something you drench in sauce seems a bit unusual. Your mileage may vary though!",

I had the Argentino salad with steak, medium rare and it was prepared to perfection! The 4 different sauces they offer are all equally delicious and different!

There was a nice char on the outside, unfortunately this carried over to the frenched rib bones. Two were burnt off when it came out, the other two fell apart on the plate. Not appetizing. The meat was under-seasoned.   The accompanying small casa salad was tasty, especially liked the grilled grape tomatoes. Dressed perfectly, a little understated, as I prefer.   Grilled corn was under-seasoned as well, and there isn't any salt and pepper to be found. Could have used a bit of char on it. They could have used some of that tin foil it was wrapped in to protect the lamb rib bones....  Gaucho papas were delicious. Wouldn't change a thing. They were grilled perfectly, I loved the seasoning, and the oil was decadent. Nice-sized portion for three bucks. Plenty to share.   They have a small selection of self-serve sauces, well balanced and diverse. I thought they were very flexible and all complimented every menu item in a different fashion. Very oily, but great with the meats.   I will definitely go back. Baby Girl brought me a chicken sandwich home about a month ago, and I crushed it. Shredded chicken and ajo sauce on that grilled ciabatta. I was so full I couldn't eat the rest of the day. Killed it.",

    "text": "I loved my first experience in the newly expanded, well-renowned Gaucho! I ordered the chicken sandwich, which came out on a toasty grilled ciabatta (crunchy on the outside, chewy on the inside...yummm). I was unaware chicken could taste that good- obviously I shared only under duress.   My lunch partners ordered the skirt steak and the lamb rack. The skirt came out with an incredible marinade, with just the right preparation- an inspired performance. The lamb, while perfectly seasoned and cooked was the only reason for a star deduction! Compared to the other portions, which were huge, the lamb was a paltry 4 ribs and a tiny side salad. Perhaps they need to charge more and offer a larger amount of lamb, but we were very surprised by the notable difference in meat on that plate.   The ambiance is changed from the joint's humble(r) roots, and feels a bit more like the hip, buzzing restaurant it became. There is still a great view of the kitchen, and intimate seating, though you are no longer elbow-to-elbow with the next diner.   In summary: We loved it, we'll absolutely be back, just not for the lamb.",

FOOD We ordered the top two recommended sandwiches: Ribeye sandwich (medium rare, unless you tell them otherwise) and the Rosemary braised beef sandwich.  Wow, the ribeye was perfection! Definitely a heavy sandwich with thick cuts of ribeye topped with roasted red peppers and onions on a ciabatta-type bread. The rosemary braised beef sandwich was delicious as well, a little lighter than the ribeye, but still filling. The horseradish sauce went very well with the beef and caramelized onions.   The four kinds of sauces they offer were excellent. Definitely try dipping your sandwiches in them for an extra kick!  SERVICE Despite the long lines, the food was made in a reasonable amount of time. To make the line more bearable, there was always loud and silly banter amongst the cooks and register. It was as if I was at an improv show! One customer was taking a photo and the cooks immediately struck a pose. Another was hugging his girlfriend, and the cooks joked out loud to their customers that he was actually \"holding her up from falling down\" due to the long wait. Hilarious! Order up front and they call your name once your order is ready.  IMPRESSIONS There aren't many places that serve such quality meat inside a sandwich at a reasonable price. Each meal comes with a side of laughs as well. Everyone there is happy and leaves with his stomach happy, this is why Gaucho's is a must visit...just be prepared to wait at least 20 minutes.",

    "text": "I couldn't believe there existed a restaurant with 200+ reviews and 5 stars so I had to check this place out. Of course I decided to do this on one of coldest days of this year. Despite the tiny space, the guys working there made me feel at home. With so many options to decide, my friend and I got all the options we wanted: jamon serrano, the meat and veggie empanada, gaucho papas, and rosemary braised beef sandwich.   My description of the food will never give it justice. I highly highly recommend the jamon serrano. All the components of the dish was picked out carefully to complement each other. I even took the left over goat cheese and picked onions and added to the rosemary braised beef sandwich. If you don't have time to sit down, the sandwich is your best option. Hearty and satisfying, it can even satiate a caveman. The meat and veggie emapanadas were seasoned well and the emapanada dough was flakey and buttery. I preferred the steak but I am also a meat lover so my preference is biased. The gaucho papas weren't anything special but served as a nice accompaniment to our meal.   I think their sauces deserve a separate paragraph. One of their workers explained to me the ingredients in all of the four sauces. Their main ingredients for each are: onion, parsley, onion, and red pepper. The chimirri (parsley based sauced) was  my favorite for it's potent flavor followed by the garlic, red pepper, and onion. Their sauces are great companions for any of the dishes. I personally enjoyed the chimirri with the bread and red pepper sauce for the potatoes.  Gaucho not only serves awesome food but is one of the few restaurants that have excellent service. The workers truly looked like they enjoyed their job and even offered my friend and I to warm ourselves up by their grill. Their antics along with the food makes Gaucho a must stop. You know I'll be there again!",

Ordered:  Bife de Chorizo | NY Strip, rare Los Sprahts | Brussel Sprouts, sweet peppered bacon, and cider reduction Caldo del Mar | Mussels, clams, squid, fried capers, lemon, garlic, tomato, and a secret ingredient.  My favorite part is that it's not ridiculously expensive. I recommend the steaks, and the brussels were really good. I was disappointed by the seafood, next time I'll just stick to the land meat.   I've looked through the many pictures, and I'd want to come back and try the sandwiches too.  The only downside or unimpressive part of Gaucho is that the eating area could be improved-- it feels like a McD's dining room. Wobbly chairs and tables.",

    "text": "I pray to God that the owner sees this review, because I had briefly spoken with him once before and he seemed like a very genuine guy who cares about his business. So, here we go:  I must preface this review by stating the following: I enjoy the food from this place moreso than any restaurant in Pittsburgh. It really is delicious. Unfortunately this is the absolute worst managed restaurant I have ever been to or seen. If not for the unbelievable food I would never come here. The line during the busy hours in unbearable. I can understand and even apprecuate a place that has a line because the product dictates higher demand. That is not the entire cause of the problem here. Yes, thenfood is fantastic and yes that makes them busy, but these people have no interest whatsoever in helping alleviate the problem. There is only ever 1 register open with 1 person taking orders. ONE! Meanwhile there is a second register sitting right there that no one uses while 1 guy stands there and does nothing but offer u a glass of water while you lose your mind, another older guy sits on his ass at the end of the counter doing nothing, and guy number 3 who im assuming is the worlds worst restaurant manager concerns himself only with the shape of the que that has formed and whether or not the door is closed. OPEN THE SECOND REGISTER YOU WORTHLESS FOOL! I cannot get over how much i love the food here, but by the time i get to order I am so completely disgusted and frustrated after having watched these clowns do nothing for 45 minutes that I wish I could bring myself to stop eating here simply out of spite. I have never been so overcome by anger and frustration at any restaurant before and it happens EVERY SINGLE TIME i come here. Anthony, please! Hire a good manager. I know a few great people with plenty of experience. Lose the clowns and get some help. Your cooking deserves better from your staff.",

I found out It was a lot of local business people waiting to get in for lunch. An hour later I walked back by and the line had shortened somewhat. I decided I had to try it if that many local people were willing to wait. I then looked it up on Yelp and the ratings were fantastic. I had a steak sandwich with chimmichurri and it was fantastic. It is an Argentine type restaurant. The first place I have see fugazetta since Buenos Aires. This place is worth the wait. I looked at all the plates going by and they all looked fantastic. I'm sorry I don't have room for the chocolate coconut bread pudding.",

    "text": "If you happen to stumble upon my review over any of the other hundreds of reviews for Gaucho, look no further than the average rating for the restaurant and this piece of advice: Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is entirely worth the hype.  If you must read further, the story is this: I had been hoping to make it to Gaucho for months but could never squeeze it in during trips back home. Now that I'm back in the 412 for the foreseeable future, I legitimately hope to eat here multiple times a month. I came with a friend during the days immediately proceeding the re-opening. I hadn't seen the inside before the re-open, but I can say the new restaurant is gorgeous, modern, and well-ventilated (take a peek in the kitchen from the street, you'd never know there is a wood fire in there from the inside).  The day of my visit they had to close down early and re-open after prepping more food. This apparently had happened a few times and it feels like the restaurant is getting in its groove to accommodate the larger crowds. The line was long, but we were inside, had ordered, seated and fed within about 30 minutes. I don't think Gaucho will ever not be busy, so plan accordingly.  The staff was incredibly friendly and eager to talk about any piece of the menu. I had the rosemary braised beef con pan (sandwich) and my friend had the bife de gaucho (ribeye, cooked to order) con pan. Everything about my sandwich was perfect. The meat was cooked to tender perfection, the horsey sauce was not overpowering or overused, and the caramelized onion probably spoke to my soul. I only managed to steal one bite of the gaucho con pan, but I suspect I will be getting a whole one for myself in the near future. We shared a side of the corn pudding: a warm, savory and spicy dish that did well to complement the meaty sandwiches.  If you made it to the end of this review, I appreciate your patience, and for goodness' sake - go eat at Gaucho!",

Both were delicious. The Lomo came with two crispy slices of this amazing bread that you could dip in four sauces as well as a nice side salad. But about that filet - it was absolutely incredible. The steak was so tender and the flavor had thoroughly been marinated into the meat. And the Calabaza Asada was nice too - the acorn squash formed this lovely bowl for the arugula salad. The smokiness of the pecans and the acidity of the cranberries provided the perfect complements to the sweet squash. The restaurant was packed to the door, and for a reason. I was very happy with my experience here.",

    "text": "Thoroughly unimpressed by this place, possibly due to all of the hype. I for the life of me cannot understand the process for ordering. You wait in line forever, but feel rushed to order because you can only ask questions once you get to the front of the line. And you don't want to be that customer that takes 5 minutes inquiring about the expansive menu. Everyone will hate you for it. To make things worse, they only have ONE cashier. This establishment should accommodate the vastly growing crowd. But it appears that they want customers to feel like they're dining at an exclusive place; they could make changes but they seem to think they don't need to. There is another guy at the front counter that strictly grabs drinks and uncorks wine bottles. He could be of much more use elsewhere, such as also taking orders. I don't like that you have to tip up front. Personally, I always tip 20%, but when you're forced to grab all of your own eating utensils and seat yourself, I'm not sure what service I was tipping for. The cashier also stated that \"maybe someone will seat you if you stand at the bottom of the stairs but I don't really know what's going on right now.\" And when I went upstairs to find a seat the waitress was very rude in accommodating seating for us.  We ordered the wings and they did not disappoint. They were flavorful and needed no extra sauces. I got the ribeye platter with a side of corn on the cob and vegetables. I requested medium well steak and basically got medium instead. The guy at the counter stated that the ribeye tasted better as medium or medium rare, so I think they chose to cook my steak as they saw fit. The corn had no seasoning whatsoever. Not worth getting. The vegetables were cooked nicely on the grill, but then they were paired with a sweet sauce that did not complement the dish well. My boyfriend also had the ribeye platter with a side of corn mash and potatoes. A few of his pieces were so burnt that you couldn't even eat them. The potatoes had no seasoning and the mash was just okay.   Overall it seemed that other than having the grill flavor, there were no extra seasonings on most of the food. The wings were excellent and that's the only positive I could think from the experience. I agree with others when they say that you want to get your money's worth. I want to feel like I'm paying $65 for a meal and not at a fast food joint. Also, advertise on the website that you have a BYOB policy so that out of towners are aware. The service in general left a bitter taste in my mouth.",

We went around 3 in the afternoon, so the line wasn't horrible, but we felt rushed to order when we finally got to the counter.  We got the Paella to share with our party of 6, as it was huge along with potatoes and the roots as sides.  In some ways this dining style reminds me of Chipotle, just at a higher level.  Food was tasty, just wish the place would expand into a bigger space.",

    "text": "STELLAR! AWESOME! FANTASTICO!  Yeah, that's pretty much how we feel about Gaucho.  Just like our experience with Cure, the approach to the restaurant sets the stage for a great meal, since the wonderful smell of open fire grilling will set your tastebuds into a frenzy. All of their items we ordered were nothing short of stupendously delicious and of the highest quality. Here's what we had:  1) Empanadas - honestly, I don't know how you could even consider NOT ordering empanadas if you set foot into an Argentine eatery - shame on you if you didn't order these! They are wonderful, and are definitely the best I've ever had... even in Argentina!  2) Provoletta - Again, this is an authentic classic. If you don't order this, you should be committed to the insane asylum. Delicious. Comes with a very tasty arugula and lemon vinaigrette side salad. A nice option for a small bite for lunch.  3) Two filet sandwiches - These are huge! On our next visit, we are only going to order one and split it, but this time, we just took the extra one home and wolfed it down the next day.  I was instantaneously addicted to this place, and will definitely be back in the near future! Love it, love it, love it!",

Needless to say, we were not disappointed. There was a wait for about 30ish mins but it was worth it. We all got sandwiches and they were all really good, Crane sandwich had excellent reviews so I figured why, not. It really lived up to its reviews. We also got a set of empanadas on the side and *mouth watering* definitely a must!",

Went New Year's Eve. It was delicious. We had the Gondola and Parrilla Mixta. The line wasn't too bad at 5:10pm. The other night it was out the door. By the time we left, it was out the door again. The difference between take out and dining in, the food was hot and delicious compared to take home being cold. The dipping sauces were great too.   Large dining area in the back. Helpful staff.   Will definitely go back and eat more and try other selections.   this is definitely one of the better restaurants in Pittsburgh",

There is  no tableside service; you go to the counter and order, get your own silverware, your own napkins, your own hot sauce.   2.When you're done you get to clean up after yourself.   3. The menu board is confusing. A majority of it is written in Spanish. Anytime you need to move around to order, get your food or utensils, you have to navigate  your way around customers who are huddled in front of the board with confused looks on their faces. I guess they don't speak Spanish either. And why should they, this is America.  I caught them on opening night after their \"big\" remodel. Somehow it was easier to put up with these things when the place was just a little hole in the wall. At least it had character then. Now it's just un-personal and way overpriced. While they may come up with some thought provoking combinations of ingredients, the food is just not that great. Cut the prices by 40% and I would give this place four stars. As it is, I'll give them a two.",

    "text": "I'm a huge fan of Gaucho and it's super easy to give them 5 stars.  The quality of the food is consistently awesome. Some of my favorites include the flank steak, humita, foccacia, the rosemary braised beef sandwich, seafood stew, grilled corn on the cob, the shrimp....honestly, I've never had a dish here that I didn't think was delicious. I love that the menu changes seasonally and combines familiar items with more adventurous ones.   This place is so fun for a family-style meal with a nice bottle or two of wine (BYOB) because you're going to be eating off each other's plates anyway.  The steak temperature can be somewhat inconsistent. I started ordering it rare after having a few instances where only the center piece of my steak serving was actually at medium-rare, but then ended up with an order of steak that was definitely the Pittsburgh definition of rare. Regardless of this, the steak is always, always delicious and I would probably eat it even if it showed up in a near-charcoal state (which it doesn't).  As you can see by other reviews, plenty of people are thrown by the ordering/seating strategy at Gaucho. There's really nothing wrong with it unless your expectations are a traditional \"server-runs-to-my-table-for-every-little-thing\" restaurant, in which case, you should give Gaucho a try when you're feeling a little more independent. At Gaucho, you line up near the door and in front of a huge blackboard menu to order, then seat yourself in the dining area. When your meal is ready, they will bring the food out to you. The line can get very long and there can be some competition for seating during busy times--so I definitely suggest you make your first visit at an off-time to really enjoy the experience. Still, we have NEVER failed to get a table and enjoy our meal. The staff are super friendly, helpful, and they really do circulate and make sure you have what you need.",

    "text": "I gave the place (19/25=76%) and will look at the place from 5 different perspectives.  1. Food quality (5/5): it is by far one of the best pieces of steak I have ever eaten. Juicy, tender, well cook and seasoned to perfection. Similar to the steak you will get in a good restaurant in Buenos Aires.   2. Place (3/5): it is small and there is not enough space to sit. You can always order your food to go BUT it will get cold by the time you get home. Not setup for a large family or group of friends.  3. Service (4/5): we waited for at least 40 min before the steak arrived and there was only 2 parties waiting. I was getting pretty hungry and antsy and the salad was not helping.   4. Price (3/5). It is overprice. The price you pay in a restaurant is not only for the food quality but also for the comfort and atmosphere, and the service. I did not mind the tag because the food was awesome.  5. Parking (4/5): the place is located in the strip district and has not private parking. Therefore, eating there requires a bit of planning, a bit of driving around, or a bit of walking.  In summary, a GREAT place to eat AWESOME meat if you don't mind the parking, the small place, and the big price tag.",

    "text": "Arrived at Gaucho for lunch, just after noon, and the line was already out the door and around the corner. I had heard so much about this place but apparently missed the concept, because I was very skeptical as to if this place could really be worth it.  This is not a traditional sit-down style restaurant; you order your food at the counter upon walking in and are then able to choose a seat (they do have an outdoor courtyard area, but with the heat we chose to stay indoors) where you will be served/cleaned up after. Thus, while the line outside is a little inconvenient, it moves quickly and is very deceiving of how long you will have to wait.  I was still skeptical of this style of dining at first, but for lunch it was great!   I was very overwhelmed with menu, mostly because everything sounds so good and all the salads/sandwiches/sides are very reasonably priced (approx $10 for a sandwich; there are a few bigger ticket items on the menu such as their paella and vaca (meat) platter, but by the sounds of it they would make it worth your dollar). The staff is very friendly and helpful explaining the menu and making recommendations. I decided to take a healthy route and got the argintino salad, which is the same as the gaucho salad but with more (this took me a minute to understand upon first look at the menu). You can pick really any cut of meat to add, and the host helped me decide on the flank steak. I guess I wasn't really paying attention to what I was reading, because when it came out I was veryyyyyy pleasantly surprised that their were also potatoes on the salad--like an Argentinian play on a Pittsburgh salad with fries.  My guest got the bondiolo sandwich, and said it was the best sandwich he's ever had--even though I only got the smallest bite, I would probably agree.  I wish I had more time in Pittsburgh to go back and try some of the others!  We left absolutely stuffed, excited to finish our leftovers later.",

I am a big fan of their \"sammiches\" (sandwiches). They are made on crunchy, grilled bread and whatever else comes with that specific sandwich. Their empanadas are dank - sooo good. They come straight out of the oven and I wish I had one to eat while writing this. They also have four dipping sauces throughout the restaurant which are so good you can eat them with a spoon. Their shortbread cookies are also scrumptious for dessert.   All in all, Gaucho is deserving of more than just 5 stars for its food and service.",

    "text": "Amazing! I can't believe how good the food is at Gaucho. I've only eaten here once but will definitely be back many more times. The veggie sandwich is one of the best veggie sandwiches I've ever had. The concept was pretty basic but they managed to make it taste SO good. Also the grilled corn on the cob..perfect! At first I was a little skeptical, when the food came out the corn looked really bland. But oh my goodness did it taste so good! Just the right amount of butter and grill flavor. The only dish I feel that was a little bit lacking was the Provoletta appetizer. It was just a piece of toasted bread with melted cheese on top and a side of arugula with a tiny bit of dressing. I feel the dish could have been a little more creative. I liked the grilled cheese concept but the bread was really hard and thick and the cheese could stand to be a little more gooey. And the arugula needed more dressing and maybe some diced grilled peppers or little pieces of fresh mozzarella..anything to add more flavor. Not worth ordering the Provoletta, try another appetizer instead.  Highly recommend Gaucho! Can't wait to go back.",

He was very nice and explained to me all the dishes including his recommendations. I had the new York strip and it was cooked to my request.  The restaurant was small so the max capacity was around 10 ppl the most.  Overall the food was good and the kitchen staffs were very friendly.  This place is very small so don't be shock if you have to stand by the sauce and condiments table in the middle of the restaurant.  This is so great about these little neighborhood restaurants b/c you feel like you're at home.  I'm not sure about others, but I'm not here for the 5 stars ambience.  It's all about the food taste for me!  I ate at places where I have to sit on the curb, and the police chased after the food vendor for non-established restaurant.

    "text": "In my 4 years in Pittsburgh as a college student searching for the best local places to eat, none have come even close to Gaucho in terms of quality, price, and overall experience.  The 5 star rating accurately reflects how good this place is, and I would say without a doubt that it's the single best restaurant in Pittsburgh.  As you walk in the door, you are greeted by the glorious smell of a fantastic assortment of meats sizzling over a wood-fired grill. I have so far tried three different dishes, and honestly cannot choose a favorite, as they're all that good.  This is one of the first places I've ever been to where I actually want to make an honest attempt to try everything on the menu.    Prices are very reasonable, especially considering the quality. A lot of love goes into these dishes, and the chefs take great care in both cooking, and plating them.  The food itself is a work of art, and tastes absolutely every bit as good as it looks.  Everything that I have tried so far has been very well thought out, with all the pieces of the dish working exquisitely well with one another, creating a tantalizing dance of flavors that envelope your taste buds and give them a big warm hug that says \"I love you\".  Service was spectacular as well.  All the way from the chef to the cashier who will bring your prepared food to wherever you happen to be sitting, the service was flawless.  Very friendly, very efficient, and shows a great deal of caring about what they do, and making sure you as a customer get the fullest possible enjoyment out of your experience.  I honestly don't think I'll ever go anywhere else ever again for meats. Gaucho is so far above it's competition that they seem like cheap fast food in comparison.  Give this place a try, I guarantee you'll find something there that you'll love.",

Turns out to be well worth the hype and the wait- A 15 minute wait to order during lunch.  I couldn't make up my mind on what I wanted so I got the beef empanadas and the spicy chorizo sausage with toast.  The empanadas were filled very well and crispy with a lot of flavor packed in. Definitely something I would be getting again and among the best empanadas I've ever had.  The spicy chorizo didn't feel too hot at first but it had great late kick to it and was exactly what I was hoping for.   They had a bunch of other things on the menu that I would like to try another time, so I can guarantee that I'll be back on my next trip into town.",

    "text": "I'm not quite sure I've had a REAL steak sandwich prior to my encounter with the ribeye carne steak sandwich here. My word...what do I say?   First off, let me say their customer service is AMAZING! I called for takeout within the hour before closing and apparently they've turned folks away in the past but the gentleman on the other end of the line made an exception for me. I'm SO glad they did! I placed my order for the carne and grilled corn and was a advised it would be about 15 minutes.   I arrived on the scene with my gangsta lean....oh wait, that's a song. Sorry not sorry?  Anyway, I walked in and was smacked in the face with the aroma of garlic and roasted, grilled meat. If they made a perfume out of that, I might be tempted to buy. I looked around and noticed the homemade chimichurri sauces. There was a group of 5 in front of me but the sweet guy at the counter looked around them to greet me and offer his help. I explained I was there for pickup and he turned to grab my bag of yum. He proceeded to explain each of the chimichurri sauce offerings and neatly packed up a hefty sample of each one to go. Did I say the customer service here is AMAZING!?!? I headed back to the car so I could head towards home to conquer and devour...  Once home, I opened my bag and pulled out the little parcels, each of which wreaked of yummy garlic. First I opened the sandwich which was huge. It had onions which were perfectly grilled and sweet. The red peppers added a subtle sweetness which complimented the sandwich. The meat was tender and the taste screamed Brazilian steakhouse. (Yes, I said Brazilian...carry on). I mean it was perfect! Even the bread was fresh and perfect for this meal. Oh God, I'm sweating and salivating just thinking about it. Now on to the corn. It wasn't the frozen stuff or baby corn on the cobb. It was a whole cobb of corn roasted to perfection and wrapped to go. Yummy!  Just about every other Yelper thinks the same...this place is AWESOME and it's officially on my faves list.",

Lots and lots of goodness!  The sandwich was huge!  My husband and I split it. The beef had to have been marinated and then slow cooked. I don't like to cook but I would definitely want the recipe to make is. The bun held up to all of the roast beef. That was good because there was a lot of roast beef.  My husband ordered the Pollo ala Parilla. It is a grilled chicken, but it's not what we as Americans think of as grilled chicken. It had the skin on which was crispy. You could taste the lemon and thyme. The chicken fell right off the bone. And you definitely want to lick all of that goodness off of your fingers.  We shared coleslaw. It was a big helping. You start eating it and you are thinking of how good the crunchiness is and the sweet/sour combination and just as you swallow you start to sense the after burn. It's a deep spiciness. It was a compliment to both of our meals.  There are a lot of other options on the menu and we want to try them all but we really want to take friends back to try the Pallella.",

I've tried them twice and I wasn't satisfied with either visit, but my first experience was truly unique.  We went right before close on our first visit, so we weren't surprised that we had to wait in line. But I was surprised when they gave me a sign to hold and asked me to turn away any further customers in return for a free bread pudding. We had a few kids in our group and I didn't want to be argumentative, so I agreed to do it.  Most people left after an awkward interaction, but there was a group of douchebags who were too privileged for the rules to apply to them. I'm not gonna argue with douchebags for bread pudding, so I let the restaurant deal with them. Unfortunately, the restaurant let them stay, and we had to spend the rest of our time in line hearing them use profanity around our kids. It got even more awkward when more people showed up, and the restaurant let them stay too. I recommend just buying the bread pudding and saving yourself the hassle.  I went back today for a takeout order, and luckily was not tasked with anything other than waiting. The wait wasn't unreasonably long, but I could see what looked like my food sitting under the heat lamps as the employees in the kitchen appeared confused, moving items from one bag to another, looking at the receipts, then switching bags again. Finally, one employee who looked like he was doing everything came over and repackaged my order, which was indeed the food that had been sitting under the heat lamps.  On a positive note, the employees we spoke to were very nice. Also, that one employee was very good.",

    "text": "Coming from our road trip from Chicago my fiance and I decided to stop by Pittsburgh and check out the city.   Arriving during lunch hours , I yelped for some restaurants and this came up.  I never had Argentinian food before, so what a great way to have it, plus I couldn't say no based on the  pictures and reviews I read.   We arrived at the restaurant right when it opened so we were greeted by a very friendly worker. The menu is written on a huge chalkboard on your right. Since it was my first time here, a helpful server was nice enough to take us through the menu and also telling me some of his favorites. The way it works is that you order from the menu, then you pay and then they bring the food to you. I ordered their el guacho salad with flank steak and a side of sweet chorizo. The fiance got the chicken and papas.   After you pay, you grab your untensils and your chimi sauces. We didn't wait long at all. The meat was delicious, season perfectly  well, juicy and tender. I asked for my flank steak to be cooked well done and I was even surprised that my meat was still juicy and not chewy at all. I got that small salad which was packed with lots of greens, corn, red radish, asparagus and few slices of avocado. The sweet chorizo was also juicy and perfect. I tried my finance chicken which was moist and season well. If you want to add more flavors you can dip your meat in their chimis.   I enjoyed my meal and I would highly recommend Guacho. I would advise to prepare yourself by looking at their menu before walking in and know what to order because the lines can get long fast. Other than that I give it a 5 stars",

The place is tiny with limited seating, but we went around 6:30 on a week night, and it was perfect...still quite a few customers, but not overwhelmingly busy at all. I ordered the pulled chicken sandwich and my husband got the rosemary braised beef -- it was described on the menu simply as \"f**kin fantastic\", which we got a kick out of. Then we split the veggie empanada, grilled corn, and potatoes as sides.  So, let's talk about this food. In this case I can only channel Janice from \"Friends\" and say OH. MY. GOD.  Have you ever been legitimately sad when your meal is over and all of your food is gone and wished that it was socially appropriate to order a second dinner? That is how I felt about my meal at Gaucho. The pulled chicken sandwich had tender, melt-in-your-mouth chicken, sweet caramelized onions, crunchy, well-seasoned potatoes, and meaty mushrooms, all mixed with their KILLER garlic ajo sauce and served on bread that was just the right balance of chewy and crispy. I didn't know it was possible for so many textures and flavors to be combined so perfectly into one delicious bite, but Gaucho managed to do it. As for the sides, the hands down favorite were the potatoes. Oh my, those potatoes were bursting with flavor, super crunchy on the outside but soft on the inside, and pretty much the best potato I have ever eaten. The grilled corn was also well done -- perfectly cooked and was especially yummy when smothered in one of their 4 sauces. And lastly, the veggie empanada, though the least favorite thing we'd ordered, was still damn tasty too. It was packed with tons of flavor, but it was little dry, so I'd recommend taking that for a dip in one of the sauces as well.  I asked my husband how his rosemary braised beef was, and he was shoveling it in his mouth so fast that all he could do was point to the menu board description where it says \"f**kin fantastic.\"  Well said. When he finally could talk, the only thing he uttered was, \"I'm having a love affair with this sandwich.\"  Ordinarily I might be worried, but hell, I'd understand if he leaves me for Gaucho.  Not only was the food out of this world, but the service and atmosphere were too. The guy running the counter (I assume he was the manager) was super friendly and clearly has a passion for the business and the food. He eagerly talked us through the menu, explained the different sauces to us, and even later checked in while we were eating to see what we thought of the food. And I love that we could see back behind the counter into the kitchen, where several bearded men were happily drinking their Yuenglings and grilling up our food. It felt like I was having a chill meal in someone's hip-but-cozy house instead of a restaurant.  It is maybe a touch on the pricey side, but so well worth it for the quality of the food. In fact, I'm pretty sure that I'd be willing to promise my first born in exchange for a gallon of their garlic ajo sauce. Btw -- a glorious bonus was that I was still able to taste the flavor of that sauce in my mouth for the rest of the night. I was really sad when it was time to brush my teeth before bed. Yep, it's good stuff.  Moral of the story: Go go go go go go go go go!",

The wait was about 30 minutes, and the line went out of the door, so if you can't stand for long periods, then maybe Gaucho Parrilla isn't for you. However, they did take our order while we waited. So, by the time we sat down, it was only a few more minutes before our food arrived. It was delicious, and worth the wait.",

We also had the mushrooms, spaghetti squash and sweet potatoes as sides all of which were nicely done.    The sauces are excellent as well.  I really like the red version.     Preserved the gaucho salad and it wasn't much more than the salad that already came with the steak.  It was just a couple extra beets and some avocado.  If you already have a house salad with your meal I would do other sides over this.    Great place.  Be prepared for a wait.",

    "text": "It's not Argentina but this place is close enough. It's a fast casual place so you order when you walk in and they call you by name when your order is up. Unfortunately they don't have a liquor license (which we didn't know until we got there) but it's BYOB with no corkage fee. All the utensils/plates are also self serve and located right after the order counter. Reynaldo have 4 sauces available, classic chimichurri, garlic, smokey pepper and onion.  We ordered the carne and rosemary beef sandwiches, beef empanada, red potatoes and of course the alfajores. The beef empanada was ok and could go without it.  Everything else were amazing though. Both sandwiches were great but I especially loved the carne. You get a choice of the cut of beef and how you want it cooked (just like any great steak place!). The sandwich had a great amount of nicely charred and perfectly cooked meat in it. The flavor is already great but I love garlic so I had to add some of their garlic sauce. Another amazing garlic surprise are the grilled garlic gloves that came with the potatoes. You can't go wrong with finishing up your amazing meal with some alfajores. They are very delicate though so they don't travel well.  Definitely a great place for meat, carb and garlic lovers!",

    "text": "I've always heard about people talking about gaucho, but never actually tried it until my third year in college. Each time I came I knew exactly what to expect, and gaucho never fails to deliver. The only downside is that the wait can be pretty long during primary dinner hours (7:00 pm and after), so if you go around 6:30 or earlier the wait time can be significantly reduced.   The main thing that I typically order is the Carne De Vaca, which is a meat platter consisting of a cut of meat of your choice (sirloin, flank, etc.), a side of salad, and bread. A few times, I have gotten two cuts of meat to split with my friend, one order of a large and another order of the small. This allows us to get a portion of meat in between a large and a small, and two cuts to try.   I have also gotten the Carne, which is a sandwich based on a meat of your choice. This has really good peppers that complement the meat well, but to me I personally prefer the platters because they are more filing and have more meat overall.  The last time I went, I shared the Asado plate with one other person, which gives you all five cuts of meat (25 oz total). It was a lot of meat and more pricey, but also very tasty and filling. In my opinion, though some cuts were more tender than others, I didn't think the difference was big enough for me to change my typical order of one of the cheaper meats in the platter.  Overall a great experience and a must try for all those who visit or live in Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "Though I am not a steak person, I have been here on a few occasions and it has not disappointed! We are well aware that there will always be a line of customers streaming out of the front door, rain or shine, hot or cold. The restaurant does not take reservations and they are a BYOB establishment which adds to their appeal.   When entering the building, the menu is handwritten on a chalkboard wall. They have a variety of items ranging from salads, small plates, and sides, to sandwiches, exclusive plates, and specialty items such as paella. In addition they have a few pick up dessert items that they display nicely in glass containers as well as a few other options to have with a cup of coffee.  Once deciding on the order, you walk up to a counter where an employee takes your drink menu. We brought wine and some bottled beer and she kindly uncorked the wine (no fee) and provided an ice bucket for the beer, offering for the wine as well. She gave us glasses of water to go along with our select beverages. They do have a few drink items one being Red Ribbon, an old fashioned bottled soda found in a variety of flavors. Next is the order and checkout station, and since the restaurant was packed, we spent time chatting with the employee until our table was ready. She took our order, we paid, and she sent us on our way to our table. I ordered the deconstructed pollo sandwich with toast with a side of roasted spaghetti squash. The chicken came with pickled red onions, lettuce, and mushrooms. The deconstructed version appeared smaller in size than what you would receive on the sandwich (well duh, no bread but still), but with the side of squash and toast, it was enough. They offer four different types of sauces to put with your meal and they are all rather tasty! In the past, I have had the pulled pork sandwich and I think that nudged out the chicken by a hair. It was delicious!   This will be a place we will go occasionally. It is a fun restaurant to go to for an evening with a group of friends or couples and to not expect a rushed dining experience. The prices are so reasonable for a steak establishment, they allow you to bring your own beverages, and the food is fresh and made with care!",

We went on a Saturday around 4:30 or so. There was a wait but it was completely reasonable, I think we waited 20 minutes tops. The staff was communicative to the crowd, stating they were waiting for more tables to open up before they seated other customers.   We got up to order our food and I ordered the chicken sandwich and my boyfriend ordered the pulled pork. We also got some empanadas to try. We sat at a table and decided to try out some of the sauces they had before our food came. The red pepper sauce is to die for, we actually took some home because we liked it so much. When our food came, we couldn't eat it fast enough. I added avocado to the chicken sandwich and it went perfectly with everything on the sandwich. The portions were huge and we were both full after each eating a half of a sandwich. As for the empandas, they were fantastic and a must have. I tried the veggie one which had goat cheese in it. The goat cheese was a nice addition and added freshness  I highly recommend a visit to Gaucho, I will be returning soon!!!",

A tip I used was also you could check the general time on google for the time you plan to go. The place is BYOB, dont miss out on that opportunity!  If its your first time, I suggest getting the platter with all the different meats so you can decide on your favorite. The chorizo and asado platter are so juicy and flavorful! When we went they kept raving about the toast.. but it was not good at all so I do not recommend that. YOU MUST also try all the sauces regardless! Probably note the best place for large groups because of the table setting. Highly recommend this place and I will be back!",

We walked the 7ish blocks in frigid weather and waited for about half an hour until we finally ordered the ribeye and lamb. The lamb was fine though a little cold by the time it got to our table. However, the (pricey, mind you) ribeye was a disappointment. It was so lean that we had to ask the server if the kitchen gave us the right cut. He wasn't sure she'd roll it back, only to come back to our table and say \"oh it is ribeye, you can see a little bit of marbling there...but could have fooled me.\" *laugh*  I didn't know what was funny about expecting (and paying for) ribeye and getting something that looked and tasted like sirloin, but okay...  On a positive note, the sauces are delicious! The carmelized onion one was our fave.   Not sure I'd return if I'm ever back in Pittsburgh.   P.S. I post photos on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fletseatwithannie&s=e25d88d2e222c58ab8cc65191838ff88f8295a197dbfbd0108b374cd6883af2f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">instagram.com/letseatwit...</a>",

If you're unlucky you might have to wait for a bit (sometimes the line is ~30 people), but it's totally worth it and hopefully it's not raining outside. You order at the counter, and then wait for the order at your table.  I typically get the sandwiches like bondola or braised beef with a bunch of sauces. Salads are tasty and pretty big (this is about the small salad).",

There is plenty of street parking(if you like to parallel park), and also a few public lots over on Smallman you can park in and walk over if you suck at parking like me!   Both times I've been there has been right around lunch time on a weekday and I have never waited more than 5 minutes to get to the counter. Everyone that works at Gaucho Parrilla is very friendly and very helpful. I appreciate the warmness and it's only surpassed by how good the food is. Every single dish that I've tried there has been fantastic. The meats are so flavorful and tender, the vegetables are grilled and seasoned to perfection, the dessert shortbread cookies are some of the best I've ever had. The chimichurri sauces that they offer are a great accompaniment to all these wonderful entrees.   It definitely isn't a cheap place to eat, but the food and the quality of the ingredients are definitely worth the price.   The best tip I would give for eating here is to pay attention to the menu board when you walk in, and maybe snap a picture on your phone for reference when you get to the register. If you don't remember what you want it's kind of a hassle to have to walk back over to check the board.",

    "text": "As I am sure is the case for a lot of people, Gaucho was highly touted by many of my friends. I went on a Tuesday night at 7pm and had to wait for about 20 minutes. Thankfully the line didn't quite snake out of the door, and I was able to stay inside in the warmth.  The aroma of the wood fired grill and the somewhat rustic look of the interior combine to provide an inviting atmosphere. I liked the fact that part of the kitchen, namely the grill, is exposed to show a glimpse of the inner workings of the restaurant.   My party of 4 ordered the paella and the asado platter. The plate of meat went quickly, but we struggled through the paella. The steak was good, but my favorite part of the meal may have been the sauces; each of the four sauces are delicious and masterfully compliment the steak. One reviewer recommended ordering the paella as a group side dish, which I definitely agree with. Additionally, Gaucho is BYOB; I did not know this but, fortuitously, other members of my party did.  Overall, I felt that Gaucho was inviting, fairly priced, and had good food. I won't fault them for the wait time, as it isn't their fault that they're a hugely successful small restaurant. I will, however, admit that friends' prior praises of Gaucho placed lofty expectations in my head. While I felt Gaucho was good and maybe even worth another stop, I did not feel that it was exceptional. So, in a review of my expectations, Gaucho gets 4/5.",

We only had to stand in line about 40 minutes and was in.  Just so you know you will have to wait anywhere from 30minutes to an hour to get in. You order you food at the counter and pay and then they will seat you. They have four different sauces for your meats all of them are delicious.  We started out with Oui Oui Chicken (2 legs and 2 thighs) My husband said it is the BEST chicken he has ever had! We also had 2 pieces of Empanadas one beef and one chicken, they were so delicious I could have just made a meal out of them! Then we both had Carne Sandwiches you pick your choice of steak and it also has peppers and caramelized onions, it was very good but it is very hard to eat as a sandwich because the bread it so big. I had to eat it as a open face sandwich, the bread is very good and fresh but just to big for a sandwich. They are closed on Sunday and Mondays, the restaurant is very clean and staff works very hard and very friendly.",

    "text": "I have been to Gaucho's a few times now and it has been a consistently great experience each time! Great place to take people visiting out of town, right in the Strip District, very close to downtown. They don't take reservations and demand is high, so there are often lines and wait of upwards of 30 minutes on the weekends especially.  So, is the wait worth it? I'd say yes, although definitely recommend going on a weekday if you can. Their steak is flavorful and reasonably priced and served with bread and a salad. They have a variety of dipping sauces of which I always take back all four to the table even though I definitely have a favorite (I just always forget which one it is).   Their empanadas are amazing, especially the beef ones although the chicken ones are pretty good, too (not a fan of the vegetarian cheese ones I once tried) - the options rotate frequently, so there's always a new filling to try!   I've heard the dessert there is good as well, but have not had the chance to try yet :)",

    "text": "Well, I suppose I'm going to be the voice of dissent here, but I was Not Impressed with this place. Being of partial Latin American descent (Guatemalan, but Mom spent part of her childhood in Buenos Aires), I am no stranger to grilled meats in this style, to chimichurri, to elotes- this is the food of the summers of my childhood. However, that food my father would so lovingly slave over the grill preparing for us differed from what I experienced at Gaucho in two ways: it was cooked properly, and even more importantly, IT WAS SEASONED. My daughter and I hit up Gaucho on a Thursday afternoon for lunch. I had heard great things, and it smelled wonderful, so we were super excited. On a recommendation from a friend, we ordered the Matambre (flank steak), Gaucho Papas (roasted potatoes), and the Gaucho Salad. With a drink and tip this came to about $25. NOT a cheap lunch, but you pay for good food, right? The wait for the food was long, but we thought it'd be worth it, and their patio is really very pleasant. Oh- and we loaded up on condiments, including chimichurri (an herb/garlic vinaigrette that is essential to any Latin steak meal) and some cebolla (a similar combo but with caramelized onions instead of herbs). So, the food finally came and upon the first glance I noticed that the flank steak was cut VERY sloppily, with connective tissue visible throughout. Secondly, the inside of the cuts were so rare that they were practically blue and still mooing. Listen, I yell at people who order even MEDIUM done steak. This was beyond rare. So rare and connective-y that most of it was hard to chew. And to add insult to injury, it lacked any seasoning. Nothing. So, I tried the chimi and the cebolla. Equally bland. I mean, like, no damned seasoning at all. I never reach for a salt shaker, but boy, I was looking for one to attempt to make these expensive strips of tough tartare edible. It was shocking how tasteless everything was, but I especially was floored about the chimichurri. Chimi should be a veritable palate explosion of fresh parsley, garlic, vinegar and citrus. This was not... that. Absolutely awful. The potatoes were seasoned, and hot. We liked those. The salad was not a $7 salad. Unseasoned, with just a few drops of balsamic vinegar, and some very brown and sad avocado slices. Also bad. Perhaps we didn't order the right things, perhaps it was an off day, but as a Latina, I am absolutely astonished at the widespread love this place gets. Pittsburgh seems to never get Latin American food right (with an exception for the tacos at Las Palmas), and it is a damned shame that a place as mediocre (or even poor) as Gaucho has people jumping for joy. If only you folks knew how good this food really can be. I wish I could have you all over for the real deal.",

Last night (Saturday) was my first time back at Gaucho since the remodel.  The good news is that the food is still amazing and the prices are still the same.  Bad news is that the staff did not grow enough along with the renovation, so the service was ridiculously slow and the line to even get in the restaurant was extremely long.  My boyfriend and I waited about an hour to even get in the door, about 30 minutes in line inside the restaurant, and about 30 minutes after we ordered before we actually got our food.

This place is all about its wood fired grill and the aroma of burnt wood and food fills the air around the 16th Street Bridge. Currently, they are a small place that does better for take out. They do vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free and tons of meat selection for we carnivores. Put this place on you list to check out but dont expect to have a seat. Very limited seating - 6 high tops chairs. They bought the neighboring building and will have much more seating by the end of the summer though. Definitely looking forward to seeing what Gaucho has to offer in the future...obsessed already with their wood fired cuisine.",

Very small place that smells like heaven should smell like...beautiful food fired beef.  The ribeye platter was awesome and they season everything so perfectly.  Nothing here is lacking flavor.  The only reason why I knocked it down to 4.5 was the cooking temp of the ribeye.  I don't think they cook temp to order (I didn't ask, however) and everything seems to be cooked to med well.  If it was cooked to med rare I probably would have asked to sleep on the roof indefinitely.   The grilled corn was probably the best corn I've ever had and the potatoes were phenomenal - big seasoning there too.  My wife ordered the turkey sandwich and it really was special too.  Everything here is just very high quality and well prepared.    Let me say - the best thing possibly about this place are the 4 sauces they have sitting out that you can put on anything.  They are just dynamite.  We tried all the sauces on just about everything.  It really put the meal over the top.

I wish I could say I'm going to branch out in the future, but it's so flavorful that I can't make that promise. The small portion is definitely enough for dinner if you have a moderate appetite. To round out the meal, order an appetizer. I've had the jamon plate with goat cheese (delicious), the roasted corn (delicious), and the fungos. The mushroom portion was a bit scant for 5$, but they tasted great in combination with the meat.  I definitely recommend stocking up on sauces while you wait for your food - the ajo is my favorite. Beware that there is essentially no/very little seating at the restaurant. If you can snag a table outside that's great, otherwise there is just a little counter space inside.  My one complaint is that there were a ton of flies on the patio area the first evening I was there. They were gross and distracted from the experience - but the food was good enough that I went back a second time within two weeks. BYOB.",

The wait was long on a Wednesday night, so I can just imagine the weekend.  I waited for at least 45 minutes, starting at approx 7:00.  When I finally reached the front of the line, I had changed my mind about what I was going to order at least 10 times....lol!  I decided on the ribeye plate w/ 1/2 order of shrimp and grilled mushrooms.  I was then escorted to my table by one of the porters, and the second wait began, at least 20-25 minutes, but the food was absolutely worth the wait.  The steak was accompanied by the mixed gaucho salad which included caramelized onions and strips of carrots, in a house dressing, delicious.  There was also a slice of grilled ciabatta bread for dipping in those beautiful, housemade sauces.  I thought that my favorite would be the chimichurri, which I enjoyed, but my favorite was the garlic, also tried the onion and red pepper sauces.  The sauces were the perfect compliment to the entire meal.  The ribeye was cooked perfectly, between medium and medium well, just the right amount of fat, which I usually don't like, but in this instance, kept the meat, moist and juicy.  The shrimp were perfect as well.  Shout-out to the cashier, who helped me in choosing the desired \"doneness\" for both.  The entire staff was a bit laid back, in a good way, super nice and very helpful!   On the way out, I ordered the apple pecan bread pudding, which required \"another\" wait, approx 10 minutes, but it's baked to order, so I won't complain, and after tasting, I absolutely had no complaints.     I will ABSOLUTELY return!",

They're a Argentinian meat/sandwich joint that's creating a quiet the buzz.  They have a special spice blend on their meats of filet, ribeye, flank, skirt with sauces such as chimmichurri. The sandwiches come on a toasted chiabatta bread which is perfect for steak sandwiches.    The wait is long if the weather is beautiful out, but I recommend calling ahead and getting it to go. That will let you avoid the line and get your food. This past Saturday it took 1 hour to wait in line, order and get our food.   A Suggestion: Have 1 person dedicated to sending out food. There's 1 person doing everything from ringing up orders, refilling sauces, refilling forks, sending out food. This slows everything down and can be frustrating when the line is extremely long.   Overall, can't wait to go back to this place. Wow.",

It's so good, our downtown office orders ahead and  sends team members on the bus to go pick it up. My favorites are the chorizo sandwich and the provoletta, but all of their sandwiches are outstanding and a fantastic deal. Their sauce options enhance the whole experience and set this place head and shoulders above the rest.",

    "text": "This is still one of my absolute favorite Pittsburgh restaurants, even after my going fully vegetarian a few years back.  Given that 80% of the menu is steak-related, I think that's a testament to the quality of all the food.  They have a wood-fired veggie sandwich that still makes me weep happy tears, and they have an always tasty veggie empanada-of-the-day (as well as a daily meat-focused one).  In addition, there are several side dishes that are vegetarian and excellent, including scrumptious salads, potatoes, and veggies.    I'm sure other reviews have mentioned how crowded it is, because the word is out about the ridiculous deliciousness of Gaucho. Most of the time you will be waiting in a long line spiraling outside the door.  I'ts still worth it.  They seem to move people inside and seat people at a good pace.  I tend to go right when they open for lunch when the line isn't too bad, and plan to heed the advice of others and call in a take-out order to avoid the wait.  Heavenly food.",

Each time I've been there they have been featuring a cleverly named dessert that was absolutely scrumptious!  My go to is the Rosemary braised beef sandwich. I was overwhelmed with emotion the first time I had it..it's unbelievable. Everything there is. I wish I could give it a higher rating. Go there. Please go now. What are you waiting for!?",

Arrived around 3 for late lunch/early dinner and spent a few minutes trying to decide what we wanted.  The plan was to get a lot of different plates and share.    Ordered way too much - but everything we had was great. The service and staff were awesome.  Had the ribeye and strip steaks - both were very good.  Tried all the sauces and they were very good with the red pepper my fave.    Liked the wings best of all - so much so that we got another order to go.  Had plenty of leftovers which the staff helped us pack up for our trip home  Now we have to go back to try the sandwiches.",

One walks in and is instantly greeted by a giant chalkboard of food items listed divided into  to meats, salads, sandwiches, and sides. I decisively decided on their steak sandwich with filet and then a 6oz meat plate of flank (and it comes with a small side salad, toast, and tiny portion of grilled veggies). Depending on the cuts of meat prices vary. Strip steak is the cheapest to filet being the priciest. Ordered both meats to be cooked medium rare.   While ordering you can see all the cute young chefs working hard grilling those meats in a modern clean kitchen. Sauce is unlimited and this place is byob even though they also sell beer and other soft drinks. They have wine glasses and beer glasses on the shelf along with plates and cutlery... it's self seating but someone still brings the food to you and will clean up after you.   Oh man, the steak sandwich is good! They didnt skimp on the filet either. I knocked one star down because my flank steak was more of medium done than medium rare. Still very flavorful and not chewy. Affordable steaks here!",

The guys running the joint had great personality and a friend/customer/? had brought in some homebrew to share with the crowd. I would have given them five stars without the free beer, but it sure as hell doesn't hurt. Highly recommended.",

This place right now is hard to find as it is in the smallest little whole in the wall you've ever seen that has zero seating and almost as much standing room but anyone who has tried this place would gladly stand and eat their food.  So stopped in here on an afternoon for the first time and got the rosemary braised beef with horsey sauce and caramelized onion on a baguette.  First off the bread, because anyone who knows me knows I'm all about the bread. A baguette can get hard sometimes and the roof of my mouth feels the paid after a few bites but NOT here. The baguette was soft and not too bready and was the PERFECT accompaniment to the meat.  Now onto the good stuff.  Walk anywhere within a miles distance of this place and the cooking meat will grab you by the nose, pick you up and drag you right into this restaurant where all your carnivore cravings will be satisfied.  The meat here is sublime. Juicy, flavorful, and they PACK it on!  I have never tasted braised beef like this in my life, and I'm not really sure I will ever again which makes me sad.  This place is amazing. I cannot tell you enough just how amazing this place is.  If you are a local or a tourist like myself, get in here, grab a sammie and fall in love with your food! You will not regret it!",

    "text": "Gaucho is Pittsburgh's best restaurant. The sandwiches are incredible and reasonably priced. They have incredibly fresh ingredients and I have honestly never had a bad experience. The paella is delicious, even having had it homemade before from a True paella master from Spain. The steak platter (asado platter) is also incredible and is 5 different cuts of meat. The sides such as potatoes, rice, etc. are all also delicious pairings with the larger dishes.   My only negative experience at Gaucho came from the waiting process. The restaurant is extremely successful and after their expansion only became more popular. So popular, that most nights the line extends out the door onto the sidewalk outside. This wouldn't be a problem, except that it's poorly executed and often ends in frustration for several people standing in line. On top of that, what appeared to be an owner of manager addressed the crowd of willing, paying customers in a somewhat aggravated manner. It's obviously busy and people are confused. The last thing we want is to be yelled at by the staff before we have even ordered.   Other than the poorly executed waiting process, and slight confusion between employees and customers, Gaucho is a special place. It has surpassed my other favorite restaurants as of late.",

The people cooking the food were friendly and waiving to all the patrons.  Why i took off two stars was because the person taking my order was rude.  The girl who rang up my order rolled her eyes at me because we didn't finish our order in the time i'm guessing she allotted for.  Driving 8 hours and looking forward to eating this place as our first stop in the burgh I let one of the runners know that and how delicious it was and all i got was a stare and she didn't acknowledge anything i said.

This was a regular lunch spot with high end meats. We do not have anything like this back here in Chicago.  We waited maybe 20 minutes, which wasn't bad. This place was absolutely worth the wait (some guy told us the same thing walking out). We ordered the Asado Plate, which were all 5 cuts of the steaks they offered. It included Flank, NY strip, Ribeye, Filet, & Sirloin, which were all incredible. My favorites were definitely the Ribeye and NY strip. The item on the menu, though, that made me feel compelled to write a review was the rack of lamb. I feel that if you add Lamb to your menu at any restaurant, you know what you are doing in prepping and preparing meats. This New Zealand Lamb was cooked perfectly and was the highlight of my trip. We also split a side of the veggies.   Overall, I would have to say this was one of my top 5 lunchtime meals that I've had in my life. Maybe, even, top 5 meals regardless of the time of day. No exaggeration. If you are in Pittsburgh you have to hit up this spot. I will be back next time I visit Pittsburgh.",

They were out of bread (like, all bread), the pork, fish, and steak empanadas. Instead, the server suggested ordering the papas and getting the sandwich filling over the potatoes. I asked if we could do that for the sandwich price, but he said no. Seems goofy, bread is clearly an important part of a sandwich, a starchy substitute should be gratis, fellas. Still, the dish was fine for the extra few bucks, and the papas were delicious. The rosemary beef was very tasty, but oh MAN was it salty! I'm a big savory fan, but the beef was overseasoned. Veggie empanadas were not the soft, flaky pastry others have described, but were tough and barely warm. Nothing we were served was hot, which I wasn't a fan of.   Got the last package of lemon alfajores, which were BANGIN', SO GOOD!!   Definitely going to come back earlier in the week and give this place another go! I'll be happy to change this review with a great next visit.",

The food at Gaucho, especially for the price was lack luster, the meat came out semi warm with nothing but burnt cold sour dough bread slices as a topper. Let me just state that I have been to Argentina a few times and the food there makes gaucho look like a McDonald's, anyways the meats did not have any distinct flavors that would separate then from any other 2 star restaurant but the spicey chorizo sausage was the only good item we had. The portion size is almost about right, the presentation is acceptable which can sometimes make up for the lack of cooking skills the chiefs have. Everyone that works there is a brain washed hipster with dreads or long slick backed hair, no one in the kitchen is from Argentina. You of course can go there are try it for yourself but I wouldn't recommend it. Nothing is special about the place. Some people think it's the greatest place on earth and that's because they most likely never been anywhere else.",

The reason for going in a group is to try lots of what they have to offer. When I went the first time it was just me and my husband, and we were underwhelmed - it was expensive and we didn't really get much variety as you just order at a counter and your food comes to your table all at once so its not a coursed dining experience. That said, I have now gone several times with a large group, it's not expensive, and we get a ton of food to share. Get you and your friends a few Asado platters, some potatoes, some shrimp, provaletta, and dig into their sauces, which are amazing. Remember to bring your wine, and come early or be prepared to wait in a long line. Four and a half stars - if they had table service it would be five.",

    "text": "My short-lived journey throughout Pittsburgh led me to Gaucho. Ironically, I walked past the location earlier in the day and returned after circling through the Steel City. I heard the lines would be long, so I called to see if I could place a carryout order. It was my lucky day because they allowed me today do so! Now, picture me walking past 50+ people as I head to the entrance: I'm sure more than half thought I was cutting the line. I picked up my order and overheard a few comments: \"He's smart for carrying out\", \"good idea\", and \"that smells good\". Momma always said that I was special. I proved her right that day.   The food: I ordered 6 empanadas. 3 beef. 3 chicken. If you want to know what heaven is like, order from Gaucho (using the carryout option, of course). Your stomach (and mother) will be proud of you.",

    "text": "A terribly easy five stars to give.   I got the ribeye steak plate. It's an immaculate piece of perfectly cooked steak, thinly sliced on the bias, and served on a wooden board with a small side salad and a piece of flawlessly grilled bread.   The steak was incredible. The bread was very purposefully included to soak up the insanely good juices that run from the steak as you eat it, and the salad is a wonderful fresh accompaniment.   We also tried a side of humita which is described as \"Corn pudding w/onions & fresh herbs.\" This was fantastic and added a nice contrast to the meal.   The only thing I didn't enjoy was the empanada, and my fellow diner agreed. The texture of the pastry was off and the filling tasted a bit funny.   But I still refuse, boldly refuse even, to give this place 4 stars, because the steak was so gut punchingly good that if I found myself within 100 miles of Pittsburgh at any point in time, I would drive out of my way to enjoy another meal at Gaucho.   Good thing we came in when we did, cause the line snaked inside the restaurant as we were eating. It was actually hard to leave... not just because people were blocking the door... but because I wanted more steak... and to live there... inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "Whoever thought it'd be okay to have a copious amount of meat for breakfast is just sick in the head, and I'm all for it. On a summer weekend road trip to Pittsburgh (said no one ever), 5 friends and I went on a food excursion through the city of steel. Gaucho was a big surprise to me having grew up in Los Angeles and not expecting such an eclectic array of eateries in a place like this. We lined up right before they opened and got in after around 20 minutes, just the perfect amount of time to build up an appetite. We got the sampler and a side of okra (just to appease my flexitarian appetite). Yum yum and yum. The meat has just the right amount of charcoal and steam, with its juice oozing out right before your eyes. You can feel the warmth of the slab of steak before taking a bite, what a treat. Do note that this was an incredibly sodium-tastic meal, I'd say they could use less salt for their dry marination. And don't forget the salsa, try em all!",

I knew every answer to their questions (first timers always have questions lol) yesterday my mom and I split the ribeye steak (medium well) the pork chop (well done) the roasted potatoes with rosemary and the summer squash with breadcrumbs. The steak was flavorful and tender but it had parts that were a little too pink in certain areas and in other areas had too much char for me but in general it was a tasty steak . I got the bone part of the chop and loved it, it was juicy and delicious while my mom's main part was a little on the dryer but still tender. The squash was perfectly cooked and the bread crumbs on top were garlicky, which I like and crunchy. The potatoes could have been a little hotter because we asked for a side of butter and the butter wasn't really melting but not a big deal. I work at a hotel downtown and suggest it to anyone who will  listen!!! Long story short this place is worth the line you'll probably have to wait in to eat so go early and try the sauces they are all FABULOUS.",

    "text": "4.5 stars ... near perfect.  Loved the food!  The only small tiny item was cleanliness.. I think the wait is worth it considering how good the food is!  I am jealous on how Pittsburgh have it so good with this place... can I bring this back with me to Toronto? I'd trade it for a poutine, maple syrup, and a few peameal bacon sandwiches ... no? Didn't think so.  Honestly, I can see why it is so highly rated and super popular.  I arrived on a weekday at 6 pm and though there was a line inside the restaurant, that line kept growing and growing outside on the sidewalk.  This place is completely deserving of all the success cause it does Argentinian grilled meat so damn well.  Great thing about this place ... it shows love to all your vegetarian and vegan friends too so they don't feel left out.  Though you could look at them with pity for not enjoying the buttery tender bites of rib eye.  It's a fast casual dining style where you line up first cafeteria style, place and pay for your drink and meal orders upfront, and then be seated by the restaurant. Our wait in the line was only 15 minutes when we first waited just inside the door.  Quite reasonable seeing how busy the place is. The menu is a huge chalkboard offering everything your carnivorous friends could ever dream.  Prices here are so affordable that I had to double check ... grilled small ribeye for $15 only? Oh heck yeah.  The dining space is loud but not unreasonable and it's a vibrant, simple with a slightly rustic charm, and fairly clean.  Tables are a bit sticky ... so just be aware of what you're sitting on or putting your hands on.  Bathrooms are not bad but certainly could use a bit of a cleaning too.    One key thing after you order and before you sit down  ... pick up the 4 sauces that are along the wall right after your order area.  They are the kings of flavour here ... they made everything good be great and everything amazing become \"oh lawd where has this been in my life ... Pittsburgh? well that's a bit of a trek from Toronto but I'd do it\"  Chimmi, Ajo (garlic), pimenton (pepper), and cebolla (onion) - it should be said that no bite should be empty of any of these sauces.  They're addicting and I am so tempted to bring it back with my over the border.  Chimmi was bright vegetal parsley notes with the right acidic punch with good heat.  Ajo was a milder garlic than anticipated... think roasted garlic.  Pimenton was my favourite because it was roasted pepper sweet with an amazing smokey note.  I put this on everything ... rib eye, empanadas, all the vegetables, and it made everything great.  Cebolla was a nice sweet onion note.  5+/5  Chorizo - juicy, tender, meaty, and had a nice heat kick.  Probably one of the better chorizos I've had in a while.  I'm normally not a sausage lover on any type but this has me rethinking how I've ignored this on other menus.  For only $8, you got a nice medium sized plate and no its not enough to share but you could always try to steal a piece.  5/5  Rib eye - cooked medium (though we asked for medium rare), this grilled steak was very good.  Nice beefy flavour while still being tender ... probably my favourite cut and gaucho did it so well even being medium.  Add on the sauces and it's one of my favourite steaks of the year by far.  The fact its only $15 blows my mind.  5/5   Empanda (veg) - for only $3, you get a browned pastry filled with corn, peas, and pepper.  Without the sauces it's ok ... soft doughy crust cover a decent helping of veg.  I'd probably try something else next time 3.5/5 with the sauces  Argentino salad - generous helping of grilled vegetables and some avocados over a leafy salad.  I really loved how this salad was .. lots of smokey tender grilled vegetables.  Each bite was different and always flavourful.  4/5  Grilled vegetables - I didn't realize the same vegetables in this dish was on the Argentino salad! Oops... still good as it just let me enjoy more grilled veg for my dinner while being so ridiculously affordable.  $7 for a good medium sized plate of tender smokey grills veg? Yes please! 4/5  Blueberry and peach bread pudding - hot from the oven,  this bread pudding can be quite good.  Custard soaked pieces of chopped bread embedded with juicy bursting blueberries and peach slices.  The bread on the top just crisped up from the oven offering a nice sugary crunch to the creamy custard bread.  All the bites with blueberries were very good and I may have to try to stop hording them all...  I could share .. mostly.  One small thing ... not all bread pieces were soaked completely so the occasional piece was dry.  4/5  For the price we paid, I was pleasantly shocked on how good everything was.  Quickly served and oh so good... there's tons of the things on the menu to try and as long as you got those 4 sauces, nothing can be less than good.  I gotta find a way to bring this over the border!",

Not sure if they were just serving crap because they knew a big conference was in town or its the Pittsburgh standard but very unimpressed. I'd steer clear regardless.  We ordered two ribeyes per the Nirvana loving head bobbing staff.  One was medium and other medium rare. It was a battle of sawing through meat fibers and spitting out gristle into the plentiful supply of napkins. No one ever came to ask how are orders were or seemed to care. The sauces/condiments on the other hand were quite good and needed to choke down their meat. I think I've had better steak at outback and I hate that place. Pass pass pass don't go here ever if you like good steak.",

My co-worker and I decided to take a break from the ordinary and venture down to the strip to see what all the fuss about Gaucho really is.   We both ordered the Steak Burger and let me say it was one of the best things i've ever eaten. I tried all of the 4 homemade sauces on the 4 pieces I cut the huge sandwich into. (In my opinion this is truly the best way to eat everything here) The attention to detail in the preparation and presentation shows and shines through their product.  With the expansion of the restaurant occurring now I cannot wait to try it again. The much needed expansion will allow even more people to enjoy the amazing food Gaucho has to offer,",

The meat was tender and flavorful, the onions were soft and sweet, the sauce added nice tang, and the bread was chewy on the outside and soft on the inside! I also split the grilled vegetables and the corn pudding as side dishes. The corn pudding was delicious! It was creamy, had great texture and spice, and was slightly smokey from the charred corn. The vegetables were my favorite part, hard to believe even for me! The platter came with red peppers, caramelized onions, zucchini, asparagus, and mushrooms. Each vegetable was grilled perfectly, seasoned extremely well, and had a delicious sauce. The peppers were also charred and had a wonderful smokey flavor. The sauces to choose from too also added unique flavor to everything we tried! The staff was friendly and accommodating in the great atmosphere the restaurant had to offer. However, the line was insanely long and it took almost 30 minutes to order, so I would either go early, go when you have a wide open schedule, or order ahead. Either way, it was well worth the wait! Definitely a place to try in the strip district of Pittsburgh!",

Two positives to the place is that it is BYOB and the menu has an enormous amount of options to chose from (some of which sell out rather quickly though but are constantly coming back as the night progresses)",

My advice would be to find some way to expand or add more seating if at all possible.  It's worth waiting for but it would be nice if the lines didn't get so long!

I came here with my brother at what I thought would've been at an off-time. It was neither lunch nor dinner, right around 3:30pm; yet, there was still a long line outside the small entry way. Mind you, Pittsburgh had just received about a foot of snow the night before so most of the streets were empty; however, Gaucho Parilla must be doing something right for it to still have its patrons wanting it when it's freezing outside.   It being our first time here, and seeing how busy it was. We could only imagine it to be worth the wait. The prices were a little on the steeper end, but I wanted to try a little bit of everything so we shared the Parrillada Mixta (NY Strip steak, grilled chicken boob and spicy chorizo with 2 pieces of toast), an order of the beef empanadas, and a small El Gaucho salad.   The steak was prepared at a perfect medium rare and was delicious. The chicken boob [sic] was juicy and paired perfectly with the Pimenton-Red Pepper sauce. The spicy chorizo was also very tasty. The portion sizes weren't too large and honestly was the perfect amount of food.   The beef empanadas are highly recommended. The outer crust is very crispy with the innards seasoned well and yummy. I could've had just these empanadas and been perfectly satisfied, although it would've probably taken 10 of them.   I would recommend Gaucho Parilla to anyone visiting or even residing in Pittsburgh if it didn't take forever to get into the restaurant and order. I would not recommend if you're coming with a super large party, although they can very well accommodate for one.",

    "text": "Came here for dinner last night for a friend's birthday. We wanted to come on a week night since the weekends are crazy packed. We got there around 6 and there was a little line. We waited in like for about 15 minutes. While we were in line a lady came around and asked how many people were in our party so that we could be seated once we ordered. I thought that was a nice touch. I ordered the small flank steak plate and an order of maiz (corn on the cob). Everything was delicious. My steak was tender and juicy. ( i got mine medium rare). The chimichurri they put on the steak is amazing! They have four sauces: a chimichurri, a garlic sauce, a Smokey pepper sauce and a carmelized onion sauce. All four were so good but the chimi and garlic are my favorite. This place is also BYOB with no corkage fee. This place is worth the visit!",

Waiting in line can be a little rough but give you the time to chitchat cause when the food comes out, it goes silent with people chowing down. Takeout is an option if you don't like waiting.  My favorites from here: - Chorizo. I wish I had known how delicious it was the first 6 or so times I've visited.  - Carne. steak sandwich with grilled onions/peppers.",

When you get inside, you need to wait until your whole party arrives before you can order, but you can pass the time by browsing the extensive menu on the board. The two times I've been there, the wait was under 15 minutes, but most nights, people wait out the door. However, the wait is really worth it! The food has so much flavor and the sauces are really yummy.   My first time there, I ordered the Qui Qui Chicky which is listed as a \"small plate\", but you get 4 pieces of chicken so it's forsure big enough for a meal. The next time I was there, I got the 6 oz flank steak plate. The steak was very tender and grilled perfectly! Both meals pair very well with any of the sauces. Also, there is a paella that I haven't gotten but I feel is worth it if you're in a large group of 5+ people.  Gaucho is great, and I'm only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because I also had their empanadas which I heard really good reviews about, but I don't think they're anything to write home about.",

I like the concept of this place, you wait in line and order and the food is brought out to your table. They also have a BYOB policy, which makes it really nice to just bring a bottle of wine to share.  Once the food arrived, I was amazed. The chicken empanada was perfectly flavorful. The chicken sandwich was absolutely huge and had the best fluffy bread. My favorite part of the entire meal though was the roasted pepper red sauce.

Now I just have to convince them to open a Gaucho Parrilla in Columbus, Ohio!   For starters, if you're going to GPA, you need to get there as early as you can because the lines get really long, really quickly!  My group of four arrived at around 5pm on a Saturday night and the line was already out the door.    Once you're in the line, you can check out their chalkboard menu.  Be aware that they will erase items as soon as they're sold out of them so have a backup in mind just in case they run out before you can order.  After you place your order, the restaurant staff will hook you up with a table in their dining area.  The decor is really cool with an old western feel.  They have plenty of non-alcoholic drinks for your convenience but this is actually a BYOB establishment.  They will provide you with stemware and you can bring in whatever you want!  This is a great way to ensure you'll be able to drink what you want and it comes at a lesser cost!  They don't even charge a corkage fee.    Now for the best part: the food.  My meal at GPA ranks in the top ten meals I have ever consumed, in my life.  I am not exaggerating.  I ordered the sirloin with a side of grits.  My steak was cooked to perfection and had the most delicious seasoning.  It came with a side salad that was fresh and tasty.  I also enjoyed a piece of chargrilled toast and it was amazing!  Finally, the grits were the best I've ever had in my life and that is no tall tale.  This place gets ALL of the stars.    We all loved it and next time I go to Pittsburgh, I will likely eat all of my meals there because that city definitely has nothing that could top Gaucho Parillo Argentina.  Keep up the work, GPA!  See you next time I'm in town.  (Unless, of course, you decide to take up my offer to come to Ohio!!!)",

When I suggested this place for dinner, he said, \"No way, Yinzers don't eat that.\" Well he was very wrong and we decided to come here at the advice of our Uber driver. We had the Asado Platter, grits, eggplant, beef and chicken empanadas. This was way too much food for two people but we had to try everything since we had limited time in Pittsburgh. The meat was perfectly charred and done medium-rare (per request) and the Asado Platter is a great way for trying all the cuts. I wish more steak houses had this option! The grits and eggplant sides were mediocre but necessary to balance out our very carnivorous meal. I felt the same way about the empanadas, there was a little too much breading for the amount of filling. In the end, my boyfriend also had to admit that this place was pretty great and that Pittsburgh has come a long way since his college days of fried mac and cheese bites, towering sandwiches, and spicy wings.   Tip: Dip everything in their 4 sauces and come early or be prepared to wait! We came 20 minutes before opening on Saturday and there was already a line of 10+ outside the door.",

We ordered two small flank steak platters (recommended by a fellow yelper) along with 6 Empanadas (2 Beef, 2 Chicken, 2 Veggie).  My steak was medium rare and was cooked perfectly.  The other half got medium and she was quite pleased.  The steak smells and tastes so darn good, lots of flavor.  The empanadas were also really good.  Nice and crisp, with flavorful 'guts' on the inside.  My favorite was the veggie, shocking for me, but it was spicy and tasty.  The staff here, for as busy as they are, are quite upbeat, fun, and courteous.  They really did a nice job.  The food was delivered within a very reasonable time-frame as well.

The meat is perfectly cooked and stick to your guns; if you like rare go for it because they will get it perfect. Your veggies will be beautifully grilled and charred right to the point before it has that burnt taste. The 4 house made sauces will delight every part of your palate and try all 4 and see which one you like the best. The bread is always so crisp yet chewy...lightly brushed with olive oil, use it to soak up all the meat juice.

The sandwiches are all awesome. I love the Carne where you get to pick which cut of steak you want on your sandwich and it's paired with chimichurri, peppers and onions on delicious bread. It really holds up to the sandwich. I got NY Strip this most recent trip, but want to try them all. It was just a perfect sandwich. Depending on the sandwich you get, you'll be able to try some of their sauces. I loved the chimichurri that came with this, but also want to try one of the sandwiches where I can add my own sauce.  The roasted potato side is delicious. Also really good is the mushroom side. I'd trust any of their food. The alfajores are delicious and a great finish to your meal...if you even have room after all of the tasty food. We were told they were good with coffee, but chose not to get any this trip. I'll have to try it next time since I definitely plan to go back.",

A block away we saw a line winding out from a corner. No mistake, it was Gaucho Parrilla. Standing in the rain, I saw in the faces of the crowd resolution and passion for the upcoming dinner.  No sooner than one hour, we finally made our order and got sit down at a table. Waiting staff were very friendly. We brought a bottle of wine  and a server promptly asked how many wine glasses we need. Everything was ready, dinner was served.  Wife's Carne burger made with grilled ribeye, was truly great. She also had steak and chicken empanadas. Seeing my jealous look, she cut a small piece to share. It was good indeed. My parillada mixta was also terrific, with medium rare pink colored strip steak, blacken chicken and sausage, made a meat lover happy. I had to reluctantly share some with my wife in exchange for her generosity sharing the carne and empanadas.   Great food, reasonable price, byob no cork charge and with wine glass from the house, servers came a few times asking if need any help. Except the noise in the hall made by all the excited dinners and people waiting in line, this is a perfect dining experience for us. Five star and will be back if we are in Pittsburgh.",

They provide minimal assistance in table service (if you want to go back and grab dessert, you have to get back in the long line and order it yourself), so how they've earned a tip at time of prepayment, I have no idea!

We arrived around 230 and there were only a few people in front of us which was awesome! The menu is huge and on a chalkboard wall right when you enter the restaurant. We played our order and were then seated in their upstairs dining area. Super friendly staff and an awesome environment.  We ordered two sandwiches: a pulled pork and a steak (ribeye). Both were DELICIOUS! The pulled pork came with mustard, which I am not a huge fan of, but it worked well on the sandwich. The steak was tender and soft, making it amazing on a sandwich with peppers and onions. We also got a side of corn, which comes on the cob! Super juicy and yummy! Overall an awesome experience and would definitely go back! I want to try one of the steak or fish platters the next time. The couple next to us ordered them and they looked super!",

They give you salsas on the side that makes it taste even better. Everything is wood grilled so it has a smoky taste, too. I also ordered empanadas on the side, and total this meal was good enough for me for the day. I would love to come back, and my first time trying Argentinian food was very positive!",

It comes with 5 different cuts of meat. It's kind of pricey but worth every penny. Split it with a friend!  There are 4 different kinds of sauces. My personal favorite is the Chimichurri, a green sauce used for grilled meat! It's fantastic!  And don't leave without getting some Alfajores. It's dulce de leche sandwiched between two cookies. It's like the the French macaron of Argentina!",

We had ordered the 5 different types of meat, a couple of empanadas and rice. The meal was not cheap but definitely worth it. I really enjoyed the sauces which you can grab yourself and have as much as you want. After this experience,  I came back a couple of times and tried the paella which was delicious!

    "text": "I welcome meat coma wholeheartedly when I dine at Gaucho.  Their sauces are phenomenon  (Chimmi and Ajo are my favorite).  I probably spent 25% of my dinner time contemplating about how to take some sauce home.  So standard procedure:  you can always expect a long line at Gaucho, except when it is raining on a random week night.  We waited about 20 minutes at 6:30 PM on a rainy week day.  Here's how the line works:  The line is for ordering food.  You are only allowed to order if they have a table for you.  For easy sharing, my party opted for no sandwich.  For starters, we got the chicky and beefy empanadas.  They are two-bites-and-done empanadas, so if you love empanadas then be selfish and get your own.  Knowing all the meat we were about to consume, we ordered the only non-salad vegetable on the menu:  the mushrooms. They were glazed with sauce and soft to the bite.  For the main courses, we ordered the lamp chop, ribeye, and NY strip (All small at 6 oz).  We ordered the meat at medium rare but the steak all came out a little over medium.  However, the sauces made all these problems go away.  The lamp chop was medium-rare and it was not gamey, thumbs up.  I would love to come back and try the flank, but we had a pretty amazing spread.  The special of the day was sopa de mariscos:  tomato-based soup with assorted seafood (clams, shrimp, mussels).  It's a great broth to dip your bread.  Oh, and this place is BYOB!  Apparently many restaurants are... guess we are still learning about Pittsburgh as we go.",

I decided to try it today to see for myself. I ordered the chicken and beef empanadas, the roasted carrots with goat cheese and the yerba mate tea. The empanadas were delicious very filling , the roasted carrots were probably the best I've ever had especially with the goat cheese on them they were perfect and the yerba mate tea was good it's unsweetened though so you have to add your own sweetener to it. They have salsas set up in the front of the restaurant you can get yourself to add to your food. I would definitely come back here they have so many different options on the menu I'd like to try more of them. They also have BYOB that's always a bonus!",

Now stop waxing poetic And get in my face!   Everything about Gaucho is perfection: the staff, the atmosphere, the sauces, and the food. There's always a line, of course, but it moves fairly quickly. This place is a well oiled machine. You order and pay at the register, grab your drinks, and give your name. Then you pray to the restaurant gods for an open table (Front of the house staff will help you with this endeavor).   Food is served up quickly and it's some of the best food that I've tasted in the Burgh. Meat is flavorful and cooked perfectly. The potatoes are little nuggets of happiness. Each of the four house sauces are exciting and distinctly delicious. I'm in love.",

Once you make your choice you can go to the cashier and place your order and they'll give you your drinks. You then proceed to another line (with drinks in hand) where you wait to be seated. When your food is ready they'll deliver it to your table and at that point you're on your own. If you want to order anything additional you have to go through the whole process all over again. For example, we thought about getting a dessert and were deterred because we didn't have the time. Outside of that the food was excellent! Everything was fresh and cooked well.",

Avoid game day (Steeler / Pirates / Pens).  It's going to be so packed, it's crazy.   Been here so many times. Sandwich on my first visit, Paella and Asado platter when I had a big party, and steak plate for 1 or 2.  If you have a big party and want to try everything, Paella and Asado platter is the way to go. Asado platter covers all the steaks they have. But Asado platter does not have salad, which individual steak plate do.    In terms of salads, go with the ones with roasted items.  I do like that hot-greens more than their mixed salad. You can add grilled items for a few dollars too. I normally get a grilled portobello for an extra dollar or two.  BYOB",

And their sauces... and just about anything they serve here. My recommendation is to get the meat platter with most of the meats... Perfect!",

While I was definitely INCREDIBLY impressed with the rib eye platter, and would come again on future trips solely for that, I found the sandwich and veggie platter disappointing.   We waited in line for about 45 minutes (the line is outside, beware on hot days) before were ordered and were able to sit. It seems that the hold up isn't so much space/seating as much as the fact that there is only one person taking orders, so hopefully the restaurant adds an additional register soon!   The food: -Rib eye platter: This is why you come, for the straight meat dishes. The rib eye was DELICIOUS and I'm not normally that into meat. It was cooked perfectly and was amazing on its own, but there are dipping sauces in case you want any extra flavor.  -Rosemary Beef Brisket: Good but VERY oily and very heavy. I would skip this and get one of the cuts of meat w/salad/bread instead.  -Small veggie platter: We ordered the veggie platter for something healthy in anticipation of eating way too much meat, but unfortunately the veggie platter itself was oily =/ -Peach cobbler: Solid, but no different than any other peach cobbler you've had.   *BYOB so come prepared!  *Come early to avoid the line!",

I would give it five stars if it was more of a sit down restaurant as I struggle with a place where you have to order at the counter and serve yourself things like the silverware and sauce.  We ordered a TON of food (empanadas, cheese appetizer, flank steak, ribeye, shrimp, pork, corn, rice, and potatoes) and it was a little over $100 - that is a deal in my book!  All the meets were incredible and the corn pudding was out of this world! The sauces are all good as well and between our group we couldn't agree on a favorite, everyone liked a different one and ultimately they were all good and complimented the meats differently.  We found a nearby wine shop where we could buy a bottle of wine as it is BYOB.  Also, I am sure this sounds crazy but the toasted bread that went along with every dish was SO good! Perfectly grilled and loaded with butter and seasoning.  The grilled corn was so good my daughter ordered a second cob after finishing the first.  If they could find a way to better serve the meats when you order it family style that would be appreciated.",

    "text": "The line out the door is totally worth it. Even in freezing temperatures. Ok, maybe not but hey, you can call and skip the line! (I totally didn't know that)  I've visited Gaucho once way before they expanded the space. I loved it then but I had to check out the new space before writing a review. Despite the added room, it's still rather an uncomfortable experience when coming here because of the cramped \"waiting\" area. However, there is a defined process for ordering and eating, but the board right outside the door will tell you exactly how it works which is great and prevents confusion and chaos. Usually there is a line out the door, which is dependent on when you come here of course. When there is a line out the door, the point from the door to time of ordering is about 30 minutes. Sounds crazy but it isn't that bad! Once you order and they seat you, food comes out in a snap. I think this makes up for the waiting time in line.   Anyway. Food: Everything is well seasoned to perfection here. As if the dishes weren't so bold and flavorful already, they have four sauces that are each out of this world. They're all tasty but if you aren't sure, ask them to describe what each sauce is. My favorite is the red one, Pimenton, which is a red pepper type sauce that is just great on everything. When coming here, you've got to try a steak, whether it's a plate or it's a sandwich; you can't go wrong either way. Personally, I like the plate because you still get bread plus a small salad. However, the sandwiches are huge! The sides are also absolutely amazing, especially the Brussels sprouts.   Overall, totally worth the hype (and wait) and it's not that expensive either. If there wasn't such a long line all the time, I'd probably come here much more often than I do. I highly recommend Gaucho if you haven't already tried it out for yourself!",

It was a tiny place, only seating was outside but it was well worth the cramped quarters. I got the lomo (filet) sandwich and added some chimichuri sauce for a delish finish. The sandwich itself was a ton of meat, cooked to perfection and the chimichuri was a nice spicy/fresh finish. A+ on the sandwich. Loved the ambiance of the small place too, menu written on the chalkboard, loud cooks and a friendly guy taking my order.  I recently went back and found that they were remodeling. I didn't know and was disappointed that I didn't get to fulfill my Argentinian steakhouse sandwich needs for that day. BUT I went back and LOVE LOVE LOVE what they did with the place. They moved right next door into the vacant building that was next to them. I think it may have been another restaurant at some point. The decorations are adorable, very Latin American/retro. They have expanded their menu to include salads, appetizers, veggies and other items, including breakfast.  There was already a line at 11 on Sunday when they were getting ready to open. We were first in line and I couldn't help myself and had to get the Carne con Pan. So steak, bread, onions, red peppers and chimichurri. I had the filet again and my partner had the ribeye. Both were delish and spot on. I also ordered some grilled corn, which was also spot on.  Can't say enough good things about this place. Will continue to frequent and hope their business thrives, they deserve it!",

The ribeye was juicy, but tough and not trimmed of the gristle and silver skin. Huge sandwich on ciabatta bread with roasted peppers and chimichurri sauce. Difficult to hold and eat. The pork platter was shredded and was served with grilled onions and a salad. The meal was ok, but not worth 45 minutes in the cold with the exhaust from the broiler blowing all over us. Maybe better on a warm evening and different menu selections. (The staff looked like they had gotten off from their day jobs at Trader Joe's and come straight to the restaurant: A lot of colorful hair, piercings and ink.)",

I like the set-up of ordering first and being given beverages at the front counter before you're seated. It's pretty efficient. However, given that there aren't actual servers I would expect the place to be a little cleaner. I realize it was super busy, but we had to \"clean\" off our own table using a napkin. Seating is limited and first-come first-serve. I can't imagine trying to eat here with a party bigger than 2-4 people. Next time, I'd order food to go, instead of eating on top of someone else's food remains. I'm generally not picky about a few left-behind crumbs, but this was particularly messy and there was also garbage on the floor. On a positive note, the carne sandwiches were fantastic and perfectly cooked to our liking. We got the flank sandwich and the New York Strip sandwich. We preferred the flank since the Strip was a little harder to eat on a sandwich and had a lot of fat. We also got an order of papas, which were okay. There wasn't really anything special about them. I really liked the different self-serve sauces.  I'll definitely be returning for sandwiches to go.",

I would take a piece of the steak on the toast with some sauce - the red pepper was my favorite. -Sprauhts - Perfection -Campfire Yams - Unexpected favorite. This was unbelievably sweat and delicious. -Argentino Ensalada - Great balance to all of the meat we enjoyed. -Empanadas (chicken and beef) - The only disappointment. There was a lot of dough and wasn't all that flavorful. The next time we come, I would arrive earlier to avoid the line. Also, I would not get the Empanadas and instead try the chorizo or shrimp.",

We had arrived there around 3:30 on a Saturday and most of the food was sold out, especially the bread.  We had ordered the chorizo which was unlike any chorizo I had ever tried. It was suppose to come with bread but because they wanted to save the bread for sandwiches, so no bread. But we had also ordered a steak sandwich and grilled corn. The corn was amazing. Sweet, char-grilled. So good. The steak sandwich was good too and with the added sauces that they have out. One, if not the best steak sandwich. I can't wait to go back!

The staff was very helpful and nice and served us even though there was 10 minutes left to go of the event. I tried the Rosemary Braised Beef: \"Horsey sauce and caramelized onion\" and the Chanchito: \"pork tenderloin, pickled onion, mushroom and arugula.\" The Rosemary Braised Beef was pretty good. I pretty much love anything with caramelized onion, so I knew I wouldn't be disappointed, but I didn't know that this beef dressed with horse radish was going to be so good! The horse radish flavor was subtle but you definitely tasted it every bite. I'm not a usual fan of horse radish, but the hint of it on the beef really made the dish exquisite. I favored the Chanchito dish over the beef though. The pork with the arugula, pickled onion and mushroom was just the perfect amount of flavors that complimented each other in a way that most palettes haven't been accustomed to! It was a unique way to dress up pork and a flavor experience like none other! I am so happy this Yelp! event introduced me to Gaucho's amazing eats! I already have my eye on a couple dishes and I cannot wait to try more food from Gaucho!",

The staff there were SUPER helpful and friendly.  We had 3 hardcore vegetarians in the group and we had plenty for us. The carnivores could not talk enough about how amazing the meat was. Super affordable.  LOVE THIS PLACE!  The portions are great. Its BYOB - which we loved.  We ordered the porkchops,steak, shrimp, and everything was amazing.",

Perfect grilled bread and tender meat at just the right temp.   Service was also fantastic. The guy taking orders came out from behind the counter and gave us a thorough run down of the menu. His enthusiasm was refreshing and a great example of what service should be like.  Can't wait to try this place again.",

(Its an order first, then sit down and we bring the food to you place). The only thing I can appreciate, but would rather have them do differently is the presentation of the menu. It's on a giant blackboard when you walk in and they use odd words for simple ingredients, so you're standing there just trying to figure out what's in the food (for example: shrooms = mushrooms, grass = asparagus).   Aside from the menu, the service was nice up front (great manager, he will always find a seat for you and your party), however the servers that wait the tables are very unprofessional. All the staff where whatever they want and it's not very helpful when you need to flag someone down. There was a woman with half her stomach hanging out in very short shorts...not pleasant.   On to the food...the salad I ordered was amazing & very tasty. The empanadas were bland and too pricey ($3/ea.) I still agree that if you're in the area, you must come try the food.",

It could be the atmosphere, it could be the food, it could be the incredibly friendly service, chefs, staff, anyone you end up meeting or cramming next to for lunch.  If you eat meat, get some meat. If you don't eat meat, you have fantastic options. Regardless of your (possibly non-)carnivorous preferences, get some corn. Honestly, you can't go wrong closing your eyes and just choosing anything on the menu at random. Come with a few more people and convince them you know what you're doing so you don't feel too guilty choosing more than one thing at random.  What makes a great restaurant? I'm not so sure, but I think Gaucho has it figured out. This is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "This place is amazing! I really was contemplating walking out of the 30 minute line, but boy am I glad I sucked it up and waited. I've since come back 2x! So yes, you'll probably have to wait in line, and as a heads up you need to order all your food at once and pay for it right there. So plan in our 30 min wait on everything that you want to eat.   One of the great things about Gaucho is that they are a BYOB. I've failed at remembering this both times, but hopefully someone reading this will benefit from this! Bring your wine or beer, they do not serve alcohol.  Hmm recommendations on what to get - beef empanadas, shrimp, steak.. and as I'm writing this I'm realizing I don't think you can go wrong with anything you order.  But the shrimp is some of the best I've had, and we got the party/group order of steak. Can't remember what it is called but comes with all the cuts of meats they serve - it was phenomenal and great for sharing with a group.   They have the best salsas and sauces so don't forget to get some of these, chimichurri, garlic, and 2 others that I can't remember off the top of my head. All were very tasty and went well with the meats.  You can also order take out, but beware when you walk in to pick up your food and people are standing in line waiting they will give you the evil eye as you walk out with their food while their bellies are rumbling, of course I didn't do that ;).",

Buck up and be a regular restaurant. It makes no sense and doesn't cater to the regular person who enjoys your food tremendously but doesn't have the time to sit and wait for it.

    "text": "Gaucho had been on my radar since they first opened,however, I was unable to visit until recently on a trip back to my hometown to visit my family. My mom and I stopped by on a Friday around 12:30pm. The line was relatively short at this time , but by the time we left it was out the door and around the block. When you finally make it past the front door, you are met with a chalkboard featuring the menu-all of which made me salivate while reading it.   My mom and I, after a few questions about the menu to the lovely cashier, decided to split the Rosemary braised beef sandwich with carmelized onions and horsey sauce. The beef was perfectly seasoned and quite tender. The carmelized onions added a nice sweetness complemented by the kick from the horsey sauce. They have sauces you can choose from and I highly recommend the garlic as it went well with this sandwich. The bread was fresh and was a stealthy vessel for the beef. We also split a side of mushrooms with shallots and rosemary. While these were excellent on their own, I'd recommend adding them to the braised beef for extra flavor. Gaucho is BYOB and I noticed several tables, even on a Friday afternoon, taking advantage of this. We both got Diet Coke and never experienced less than half full glasses. Service was top notch and we were checked on a couple of times throughout our meal. I definitely buy into the hype here and would absolutely return on my next trip back to the Burgh!",

    "text": "Absolutely fantastic food. One of the only few restaurants that leaves me speechless during every bite. The workers there are very friendly and are more than happy to explain the large menu and offer you recommendations.   On the rare occasion when they're not as busy, you'll receive a more standard waiter-style service. Our host seated us at our booth after order, checked up on us from time to time, and refilled our waters. However, expect to fill up your own water and retrieve your own plates and utensils during peak times.  My go-to's are always the baked empanadas, a pollo sandwich, and the alfajores for dessert. The empanadas are freshly made, amazing, and have a different filling each day. They feature three main fillings - a veggie, beef, and chicken (sometimes pork) option. The fillings are intricately crafted and the flavors mesh incredibly well. Pair these with any of their god-tier signature sauces and you'll be swimming through a sea of flavors. Get these for sure.   The Pollo sandwich is large yet inexpensive, and full of flavor, just like everything else on the menu. The grilled ciabatta bread is crispy and robust, the perfect bread to almost contain the overflowing scrumptious contents of this hefty sandwich - caramelized onions, mashed rosemary potatoes, grilled mushrooms, and the thick cut of chicken breast. The chicken itself is marinated in their legendary Ajo garlic sauce (my personal favorite). Cut the sandwich in half, scoop on some sauces before each bite, and you'll wish the sandwich never ends.   Their steaks and steak sandwiches are out of this world as well. Generally cooked to a medium with an amazing wood fire chear and sear, topped with their chimmi sauce. Hands down the best steak I've ever had.   Lastly, the Alfajores....on their website they have kind of a stale description (flavored shortbread with dulce de leche & toasted coconut) but the Alfajores are so much more than that. The shortbread on these cookies are unlike anything I've ever had before. The Alfajores are a tiny cookie sandwich rimmed with the toasted coconut. The cookie is unbelievably soft and the dulce de leche is the perfect choice to hold these two soft pillowy shortbread cookies together. Each bite is an otherworldly experience.   The sauces are essential with every meal at Gaucho and can be paired with whatever is in front of you (except maybe the Alfajores - I'll try that next time). So, I will attempt to do my best to describe the four... Ajo - My favorite sauce, pairs well with everything on the menu. Has a robust garlicy and rosemary flavor. Scoop this on everything.  Chimmi - Fantastic on steaks and the chicken, a bit more watery than the other 3 heavenly sauces but the herbs and flavors of this one keeps me coming back.  Pimenton - Has a slight vinegary tang, but the strong fire roasted pepper comes through in this one, with a hint of freshly ground black peppercorn. Great on any of the empanadas Cebolla - Amazing balance of flavors featuring caramelized onions that have been slow roasted and melded into this amazing concoction. Great on everything as well.    I'd be more than happy waiting 2 hours in line to just grab a single empanada from Gaucho. This place deserves nothing less than 5 stars, and it shows in their quality, preparation, and flavors of their food.",

    "text": "Growing up in PR, we didn't have fancy Brazilian Steak Houses, we had fancy Argentinian Parrilladas. When we were exploring places to visit in our visit to Pittsburgh, this place popped towards the top of the places to visit, and when my friend mentioned it, I couldn't be more excited!  This Parilla is a casual place where you place your order at the counter and then are seated. The food is delivered to your table. They have sodas and water but not beer or wine. They do have a byob policy.  The menu consists mainly of Argentinian specialties, and, of course, the ultimate Argentinian specialty, beef.  Since there were 5 of us at the table, we ordered a sample plate with an additional flank steak. We also ordered the grilled corn, Gaucho Papas, and humitas (a savory corn pudding). We also got the empanadas, and chicken wings as starters and the grilled pineapple, and alfajores for dessert.  There was a selection of different sauces to pick from, from the traditional chimichurri to a slightly spicy pepper one.  The chicken wings and beef empanadas were ok, not really that great. The beef needed seasoning and the wings were a little dry. Using the sauces provided helped a lot with these items. The same with the humitas.  The alfajores were a bit dry, the cookie was crumbly and dry and took away from the delicious filling.  But everything else was really good! The steaks were delicious and flavorful and the sauces complimented them to perfection. The grilled corn was really tasty, although I would have preferred a bit more salt, and the grilled pineapple is probably the best application of this idea I've ever had, so damned good!  All in all the meal was a hit, with not one dish that I would consider bad, and many items that I would happily eat all the time.  For the price, this place definitely deserves the 5 stars!",

We got the fungos (Cremona mushrooms, shallots, sherry vinegar, rosemary), cammarones (grilled rosemary, garlic shrimp w/ lemon), pescado ( fish of the day), and asado platter- all 5 cuts of wood fired steak. This was the best meal of my Pittsburgh trip and I will be craving it a lifetime. No other shrimp will ever compare. The meat, oh the meat... All five cuts were perfectly medium rare. One tasted better than the other so I kept going back and forth. Loved the mushrooms. The fish was good but everything else overshadowed it. I ate until I was in pain. Service was friendly. We brought a bottle of wine to accompany our meal. The overprice for the quality resulted in a high value meal.  I can't wait to return here.",

It's wonderfully smoked, and you can accoutre it w chimi or garlic or onion sauce, but it's awesome on its own, w the crusty bread that comes with.  Backing up, we started w the wings. Just say, \"Yes.\" This could be an entree. Big, meaty w a wonderful smoke.  K had the shrimp, and it was fantastically grilled and  flavorful enough so they definitely made it theirs, but not too much to step on the subtleties of the beast.  Evil dark chocolate dessert. If you can't make din din for some silly reason, get the deep dark chocolate loveliness.  Table full of regular guys had sammies, and they looked all that, even if you just see the bread.  Ambiance is plain, functional but the chunky wooden tables and seats appeal to me. Staff is knowledgeable and very pleasant; those who are fans of fashionable female form may get more from their visit.  I believe this is still a BYO.",

The food is still good, but they've developed the snobby hipster attitude you'd expect in San Francisco. We arrived at 8:43 pm on a Saturday, on which they closed at 10 pm. We were told they weren't accepting anymore customers but managed to finagle our way into seat at a high top in the hallway. We asked for the menu and were told \"we don't have menus, you need to look it up online\". We proceeded to try and read the lo-res photo of a chalkboard menu. Neither of us could actually read any of the descriptions so just crossed our fingers and hoped we would like our order. The experience was downhill from there...   The food was fine but everyone from the cashier to the 2 different waiters we interacted with were down right rude. We will NEVER come back to Gaucho. I won't recommend readers of this post do anything on account of our experience, but I tried to warn you!!",

    "text": "Gaucho, a vegan's paradise! Just kidding.  If you're not craving a lump of meat that's been resting on a hot grill for several minutes, then you should probably head on over to your local farmer's market or graze the grass in your neighbor's backyard.  But if you find happiness in ripping apart dead animal flesh with a fork and knife, dipping it into variety of native south american dipping sauces (4 flavors to choose from), and sloppily mashing it in between your teeth while beads of sweat drip off your face into the puddle beneath you, then wait no longer!  Request that uber, jack a few bottles from your roommate's prized craft beer collection, and call up that cool chick who's down to guzzle some brews, munch on medium rare cow, and crack a few dick jokes!  Now that we've filtered out the gentle, ethical souls from the carnivorous, protein fueled, ruthless beasts, let's get to the nitty gritty with how gaucho works.  If you venture down to the strip district on 16th and Penn on a Friday or Saturday night, you'll be waiting outside the door for 30-45 minutes.  The crowd you'll be cuddling with for warmth if you make the trip between November and March will be in the age range of 25-50 and will be wearing an assortment of high end peacoats and Nordstrom-bought dresses and high heels.  Once inside, you make a quick scan of the menu which includes the Vaca section - what cut from the dead cow you look to ingest, sandwich section - what type of dead animal you'd like to be placed on your french bagguete, or the salad section - I'm not sure what this entails but I'm guessing there will be greens, cheese, fruit, and oils all mixed together - as salad is an after-thought at this Argentinian meat house.  You order at the counter, wait to get seated, sit, eat, guzzle your drinks (byob) and leave.  It's loud, crowded, and everyone's drunk, but the food is still the focal point here.  Nobody can ignore the high quality meat and flavor which actually comes at a fair price (6 oz sirloin for 12 bucks).  The waitstaff was friendly and they all seem like cool people. 8/10 - would go back.",

Yelp hooked me up though! This place is so good!   I had the rosemary beef sandwich with horseradish and a side salad. The side salad was mixed greens with roasted tomatoes and caramelized onions on it. $5 seemed a little steep for the small salad, but it was tasty, so I'm good with it.   The sandwich was about the size of my head... and I have a large head. Seriously, if you can finish this sandwich in one sitting, congrats. Tons of beef and caramelized onions and horseradish. Simple and delicious.   The best part is that you can try their homemade sauces and the chimichurri sauce is mind-boggling. Garlic, cilantro, tons of herbs, vinegar... and some other stuff. I took a take-home cup of it because I want it to be on everything I eat for the next few days. Seriously, super duper delicious.   This place is for real. Don't get scared off by the \"$$\". If you just go get a giant sandwich for $10, you are definitely getting your money's worth.   For what it's worth, they also had some tasty-looking veggie sandwich options too.

    "text": "I've been eyeing this place for a while, by which I mean smelling it.   You can smell the smoke rolling off of a place such as this from blocks away. It's the same reason why you never see an ad for Cinnabon. If you get people by the nose, their ass will follow promptly.   I was pleased upon entering to see a clean, and well decorated place. I dread walking into a new place, and seeing that perhaps someone can cook, but be clueless as to how to make a guest feel welcome. The sun was bursting through the windows onto saffron-colored walls and butcher block counters. A giant rosemary plant sat in the window. Every detail was in place.   Prices for sandwiches looked little steep, but what landed in front of me was the size of my 4th grade lunchbox, so no worries there. I was still in a daze looking at the sandwich on a giant piece of ciabatta bread, when our host was directing us to choose from sauces on the center table to garnish our lunch. Ajo, Pimenton, Cebolla and Chimi Churri, or to you, Anglo, este es roasted garlic, roasted red pepper, roasted sweet onion, and the tradtional sauce of many South American barbecue styles. What Chimi Churri means depends greatly on where you happen to be standing. Some places use a bit of oregano, others some cilantro. All of them center on fresh parsley, olive oil, a bit of garlic and red wine vinegar. These all sat in tasteful jars with sample cups to portion out. It was hard to not get carried away, to be candid.  My sandwich was big enough I chose to cut it in half, and try the pimenton on one half, the ajo on the other. The ajo is thoroughly grilled, so the flavor almost has a savory nuttiness to it, instead of the pungent sulphur blast that we often associate with garlic. The pimenton was even better, grilling having mellowed the sweetness of the red pepper, balanced with a pleasing combo of herbs, oil, and vinegar.   Let's get something out of the way here, Pittsburgh. Corn on the cob is not to be boiled. As they do south of the border, and also at Gaucho, the ears are placed directly on the grill. Soaked in water first, and grilled with the husk still on, it arrived in a bit of tinfoil, the husk charred black. Peeled back, and used as a handle, there is no need for the Midwestern American plastic corn cob holders. Throw those ridiculous things in the recycle bin, please. Corn originates from Meso-America. Trust me, our neighbors to the south know exactly what they're doing. The husk protects the corn from scorching, and it steams in it's own skin, acquiring that important smoky flavor. The carmelized flavors of the cebolla sauce were a perfect compliment.  I am almost afraid to tout this place so highly, in that it may become too busy to get some of the awesome grub they're putting out.",

I've had good vegetables here, but um, I can make those at home no problem. A lot of their menu is in Spanish, at least the section titles, which I get and is cute but it confuses a lot of English speaking folks and makes the line move that much slower because YES, there will be a line.

However, the sauces they have (chimichurri, ajo, etc.) are amazing! You must flavor your meat like this! It is a very hip experience, and is an awesome place to eat lunch! However, make sure to be prepared for a line and/or come early. The menu is also kind of narrow. In conclusion, I give this restaurant four stars because it is a great atmosphere, but the meat isn't as amazing as authentic Argentinian meat, which I have tried before. This might be because it is the US and it would be too hard to import (duh). But, yeah, I definitely recommend this place...",

    "text": "Wonderful food served by very nice guys who obviously love what they are doing.  We went to Gaucho during a weekend visit to Pittsburgh. We wanted to eat at a local place and were interested in meat - we are low-carbers so we are always hunting (no pun intended) for good meat places. Gaucho was the first 5 stars place that Yelp brought up when I put \"steak\" and it seemed like a non-brainer, so we went there and were able to find parking on the street pretty much in front of the restaurant.  The place is tiny and pretty simple and nice inside - just my kind of rustic decor. They also have a small patio outside, but being sort of a balmy day, we decided to stay inside. My husband and I shared the asado plate and our son ate the steak sandwich. Everything was delicious. We know really good meat and the one from our asado plate was beyond awesome. They don't have \"real\" silverware and I was thinking about how we could eat steak with plasticware. Well, the asado comes pre-sliced, almost bite-sized, so really what you need is your fork. The meat is so tender that you don't even need a good set of teeth - it is really that soft. Their chimichurri was delicious too (it was served as a garnish on top of the meat). Not too garlicky, which I really appreciate, and they put just the right amount of it. I really have a big problem when they put so much of the garnish on the meat that all you can taste is the garnish. Not here - it was really perfect. The same goes for the amount of dressing in the side salad I had. It wasn't drenched in balsamic dressing, which I loved. The greens were fresh and crunchy, and there was just the perfect touch of dressing. And oh, the meat comes with two wonderfully charred/browned buttered pieces of toasted ciabatta. I don't eat gluten but it was so beautiful that I had to take a bite, and it was worthy of the stomach pain I felt afterwards (damn gluten!).  Our son's sandwich was also beautiful and HUGE. It was inside a toasted ciabatta roll and, according to him, it was AWESOME (and if you read any of my other reviews, \"awesome\" is the highest compliment a food can receive).   An observation: They were out of a lot of stuff, including cheese, which sounded so incredibly odd to me, as cheese is one of those things that don't spoil too easily so kind of weird that they run out of it. They were also out of empanadas, melon and prosciutto, ribs, and a bunch of other things. The only reasonable explanation I could find is that probably they don't have a lot of fridge space and try to always have fresh ingredients, so since we went on a Saturday, mid-afternoon, and they are closed on Sunday and Monday, we probably caught them at the end of their stock. Nevertheless, looks like they can use a good supply chain manager so their inventory management is a better. If I lived in Pittsburg I'd volunteer and would gladly receive my salary in steak and salad! :-)",

They had the flank steak and the filet mignon while I had the NY Strip. They loved theirs. As for me, that might just well have been the best sandwich of any type I've ever had. Just absolute perfection. The bread (perfect in this role - crunch in the crust but soft on the inside and able to soak up all the juices and not fall apart), the roasted, marinated peppers and onions, the fresh chimichurri, and the absolutely incredible meat. So flavorful, so juicy, so full of wood smoke. Perfection. And no need for a knife. Just melts in your mouth. I live in DC and cannot wait to come back. This place does Pittsburgh proud!",

The space is small, and yes you will be greeted by a line. The line leads you right to the counter where you are given your drinks, your wine is uncorked for you (BYOB) and you are then someone takes your order on an ipad. The line seemed to move very quickly, mostly because I couldn't choose what to order off of the chalkboard (so so many options)   Once we were seated, our food didn't take long to arrive at all. I absolutely loved all of the food that we ordered. We had one main course, which came with a salad, and then we ordered some of the sides and features. Everything was hot! and high quality! There wasn't much service while we were seated, as in, you don't have a specific waiter/waitress they all just help each other out with refills and busing tables.   The employees here were all extremely friendly! which is always a +1 star in my book. I loved that this restaurant is BYOB. I expected the decor to be different, would be nice for them to spruce up the place a bit! Also, i would have loved to have some music playing in the background. We sat on the top floor and it was extremely difficult to have a conversation because it was just so noisy with all of the other tables talking.   Would highly recommend Gaucho! Check the hours first, they are closed on Sunday and Monday. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I asked a few locals (cashiers, uber drivers, etc) what their recommendations were since I was visiting Pitt for a weekend conference and every single person recommended Gaucho Parrilla. It was such an easy decision to come here, and I would do it again!!   Came in on a weekday and there was still a line out the door (although waiting area/line is kind of a small space), and the line went by fairly quickly.   I'm sure all their selections are good, but I had to go for the flank steak plate because it was one of the cheapest, but it was still sooooo good. It was well seasoned, not too salty, juicy and so flavorful.  Also ordered all 3 empenadas to share with the group. Great textured breading and flavorful meat/veggies. Great for sharing, and try a little bit of everything.   Great ambiance, service, and food! Highly recommended.",

It was already a lot of people in the restaurant and the line was long. It was so cold so we squeezed into the door and were rudely told to wait outside because there wasn't enough room inside, which we get. However, her delivery could have been better. We hadn't even ordered or sat down to eat and that really just turned us off.  Thankful for the kindness and welcoming smiles from the employees taking orders and the attentiveness and kindness from the wait staff. Also, the food is amazing so that turned our experience around.  We decided to order a bunch of food and do a sort of family style. We decided to do that because there were so many things that we wanted to try. Glad that we did because nothing disappointed us. We got small plates, sides, and a meat plate.   For sides we got papas al horno (roasted red skin potatoes), broccolini, and roasted mixed vegetables. The small plates that we did chor y pan (sweet or spicy sausage), camarones (grilled shrimp), and provoletta (provolone cheese on toast with oregano and salad). Then we did the asado steak platter that came with chimichurri sauce. It was all so amazing",

    "text": "Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is a very unique little restaurant with a lot of flavor! I can see why it is so popular, but since I'm vegan and can't partake in the \"full\" experience which would likely include their meats, I also can't! So take my review with a grain of salt ;) And some of their delicious sauces because that stuff is ADDICTING.   Since I'm on the topic, Gaucho Parilla Argentina has four free flowing sauces available to all patrons. I probably consumed too much of the ajo-garlic one because it was out of this world. It was creamy but not in a weird way and the garlic was subtle and blended so well that I drizzled (ok, drenched) my food in this sauce. I also love the chimi sauce, but I have a feeling it goes together much better with meats than the veggies I ordered.   Speaking of which, I ordered the beans and greens as a side for $4 and the large Argentino Salad for $12. The prices are pretty awesome! My boyfriend ordered meat things, and he seemed to really enjoy them. I absolutely loved the beans and greens because they had an awesome smoky flavor, so I didn't really feel like I was missing out by not partaking in the non-vegan experience.   I think it's totally possible for vegans to get by on the sides and salads here (with the incredible sauces!!!) because they are all so delicious! Just be prepared for a bit of a line and plan accordingly. Also BYOB!!!",

You can choose different kinds of sauces there, most of which are Argentina traditional sauces, and the spicy one is my favorite. However, with some unknown reasons, their mussels that day were not very fresh, although they guaranteed that mussels are received on that day. Also, the salmon and bread were overcooked that day. We could not have another piece of salmon cuz that was the last one on that day. The food wasn't give me a good reflection, but the manager there was very polite and gave us another bread with some desserts for our lost.  Anyway, it's a good restaurant with different and amazing atmosphere, maybe we will come back later.",

I got there after work and was greeted by a line that circled the shop onto Penn Ave. This was probably the most unfun part since it was starting to get cold and I forgot my thicker jacket. Several patrons had the right ideas of bringing some beers to enjoy, which was the better idea it took almost 30 mins to get inside. Side note: BYOB and no corkage fee.  I ordered the carne con pan, which is basically a steak sandwich with roasted bell peppers, caramelized onions, and chimicurri inside. I chose the ribeye, cooked medium rare (of course), and I was not disappointed. These folks know how it cook it right. HOWEVER, skip the roasted bell peppers as they overpower the meat. The extra sauces/salsas on the side it made it that much better. And if they have it, grab a side of the marinated eggplant - straight fire . Good stuff, I'll be back again soon when the line is shorter.",

Once we got our food (30 mins later), it was easy to see what all the fuss was about. We ordered the ASADO PLATTER. Wow. Now I'm a steak lover but I don't think I'd had an abundance of different, and delicious, types of meat at once like I did that day. My favorite were: the skirt and flank steak, the NY strip was close second; but they were all succulent and mouth watering. Also ordered the CHORYPAN, which had a kick to it but was still very savory and complimented well by the onions. CREMINI SHROOMS were well made and did not have the mushy texture that mushrooms sometimes get, but they weren't dry either. QUIQUI CHICKY was also very well seasoned and properly cooked. The chimichurri sauce that the chicken came in was the perfect touch. Having chimichurri sauce easily available for the other meats was a plus! VEGETARIAN: the place is primarily meat based but there are some options you can customize: empanadas, eggplant special, sweet potatoes, roasted spaghetti squash, cremini shrooms to name a few.",

Gaucho Parilla opens up at 11:00am but you should wander over if you don't want to wait in line; preferably 5 minutes before 11. This leaves you ample time to browse over the \"chalkboard\" menu on the wall. A couple of suggestions: if you are overwhelmed by the menu.  Appetizers: I would suggest the (beef or chicken) Empanadas or Provolleta  Lunch: Haven't had a bad sandwich yet but my go-to is the Rosemary Braised Beef and the Carne.  Also, their wings are smoked and grilled with the sauce layered after cooking.   They offer 4 main sauces set in various places around the restaurant that you can grab and taste to your liking.  If you are looking for a quick bite or a sit down lunch with friends this is the place. A modern, yet rustic look, topped with friendly employees and reasonable prices leaves this as a go-to for me every time.",

Incredibly inexpensive given the quality ($102 for 3). BYOB. Brought a bottle and they gladly opened and served in wine glasses with no corkage fee. I can see why there is a line out the door and down the block even on weekdays.   Have an unusual system. You queue in line (no reservations), winding past menu chalkboard. You approach cash register and pay, getting any drinks (including water). If you brought a bottle of wine you give it to them. After paying your bill, you wait at the cash register until they seat you at a table. When we got to the table, wine glasses were already present and wine opened. Food was served quickly as it was being prepared while waiting for a table. Service was excellent,  contemporary casual atmosphere. Wait was 30 min at 6pm on a Tuesday. Easy walk from Homewood Suites.  Highly recommended.",

It is a \"must order dish\". Qui Qui chicky was tender. Don't forget to squeeze some lemon juice on the meat! And the provoletta is also recommended. It tasted a little salty at first and then a milky taste would fill your mouth! We also had empanadas and steak burger. One of the empanada flavor was great, but I cannot remember it was beefy or vegi... :(. The steak burger was not as juicy as it was described in other comments, maybe it was because we were busy eating other food and did not eat the burger until it was cold.   Environment: It is small. Go there early! Better at 11! Otherwise, you will need to wait a long time.  Service: The waiters are prompt. There is no assigned waiter. So everyone passed by would help you if you need help!",

    "text": "Just got to town for a convention and absolutely starving so decided to look for yelp restaurant recommendations in close proximity to my hotel in downtown Pittsburgh. There was a jimmy johns and seven eleven across the street but after a harrowing 4 hour drive from DC I needed to reward myself with something amazing.   This restaurant was a little over half a mile from my hotel but I didn't care. Made the 6 block trek in record time and let's just say my stomach thanked me. I had the ribeye steak plate with a salad and the salad was a beautiful concoction of mixed greens with shaved carrots, baby tomatoes and radishes wonderfully dressed with a balsamic dressing and sprinkled with fresh black pepper. This place carries four house sauces. A chimnichurriesque one, a garlic, a Smokey one and one made of onions. All great accompaniments to the steak and salad. I actually drank some of the sauce from the little plastic cup because it was so good. I ordered the broccolini as an additional side and it came with a beautiful char off the grill. I drenched it in the garlic sauce and that just elevated the flavor although it was already divine. My favorite sauce was the garlic sauce but who doesn't love garlic but the others might appeal to others.   While the food was pretty awesome the wait staff were also very attentive. While you're ordering someone gets your table prepped and walks you to it. This same individual also brings you a sampler of the four sauces which I think is a nice touch.   This place only serves coke products but is byob with and no uncorking fee for those who need some wine with their steak. The table next to me appeared to be having a wine tasting party with their meal.",

    "text": "I have eaten here several times since moving to Pittsburgh last summer, and it never fails to disappoint. Hands down my favorite go-to restaurant for bringing friends visiting from out of town, and also one I'll readily recommend to anyone asking for a new place to try. The concept is pretty simple, Argentinian style restaurant where pretty much everything is grilled. You can't go wrong with a classic steak plate--you choose the cut, they'll cook it to your preference, and it comes with chimichurri, salad, and grilled bread. The additional sides they offer are often changing, but always to die for. My favorite as of late are the roasted potatoes and garlic (those cloves are cooked to perfection and I could eat them all day, garlic breath included), and the honey glazed carrots with goat cheese. They also offer some fun traditional desserts. Thankfully most of their stuff is naturally gluten free, and I usually get a steak plate without the grilled bread. It may seem expensive at first glance, but I guarantee it is 100% worth it.",

It is a very casual place with very friendly service and high quality flavorful food. Read the chalk board menu and be ready to order when you get to the register. They have nice seating inside and a funky patio outside but seats are limited.  We started with pork empanadas that required no sauces. The crust was perfect combination of crispy outside and flaky just underneath. The salads were fresh, large and tasty.  The star is the meat. We had sandwiches. The Carne is a pick your meat (filet, rib eye...) and how cooked (rare, medium rare...) on a nice bun with peppers and caramelized onions. They have a selection of tasty sauces to use as well.  Thoroughly enjoyed it.",

Came at 11 AM and there was already a decent line wrapped around the building. Fear not though, they are speedy and efficient!  Basically, you choose your protein and can top it on a salad (small or large), sandwich or just on a platter. There are obviously lots of other protein options too....but I LOVE MY COW.   Everything was well prepared- I definitely don't have enough experience with the menu yet to advice people of what to get, but if you ever have questions about what you should get, ask the cashier! He is hella nice.   Parking: busy area! Almost like a Chinatown/Farmers Market area on weekends. Street it!   Overall, a must try if you are in PA! A pretty solid spot for brunch and dinner. Come early before they run out!",

Simply put, the food is incredible and ardently cooked and created.   The first two or three times I went, I wasn't a vegetarian and I had my pickings with the chicken and steak. Both indubitably incredible. The potatoes on the side are a must.   I've been back, ironically, as a vegetarian and still, the food is just as good. I've gotten a few salads, without the meat. And I still have no complaints. The vegetables and produce are fresh, and everything is tossed beautifully with tasteful dressing. I feel like I'm eating a 5 star meal without the 5 star price. It's pragmatically priced and seriously good.",

Their menu is written on this huge chalkboard on the wall when you walk in.  My eyes gravitated towards their 5 steak cuts (flank, sirloin, skirt, ribeye, NY strip), so I can't comment on the other menu choices (yet!!!).    So once me and my dinner date got to the register, we ended up getting the Asado platter ($50) which contains all 5 cuts of heaven-- I mean steak. They say that's roughly 25oz of steak!  It also comes with three pieces of toast and chimichurri already on top.    Service was so fast!  And I was so fortunate to have come when there was no line (we got there around 6:15ish on a Tuesday)  We were seated very promptly, and served our food in a reasonable time too. I forgot to say that the ambiance isn't so quiet, so it's hard to have a good conversation in my opinion.  The only thing I wish is that it had salad on the side like the individualized steak platters have.  I needed some greens after downing more than 10oz of steak.. oh and UGHHH the sauces. Sososo yummy, just get all 4 and try them for yourselves.  I wanted to cry after eating my first piece. Ahhh... just thinking about it now I want to go back.  On the platter, they usually seem to organize the cuts in a certain order of sirloin, NY, skirt, ribeye, and flank.  In my opinion, the most expensive cut, the skirt, was my least favorite. My most favorite has to be the sirloin or flank, as they were the most tender.  Gaucho lives up to the hype.  Stop reading my review and just go eat there already!",

I feel that it is a hit or miss or perhaps all the seasoning went on one end of the meat, and I didn't get any of it...but when I do it tastes terrific. Lastly, I've consistently been getting overcooked steak, but thankfully their sauces make it much better.",

    "text": "You want to know what I really appreciate about this meat-centric restaurant?  The sauces!!!   I have been to other churrascaria-style or meat oriented restaurants here and in other parts of the US ( I'm not going to mention names...One local one starts with G) and to ingest a plate full of potential heart attack substances without additional flavoring is ridiculous.  I know that some of you purists are going to say that the quality of the meat should speak for itself, but I don't agree. Just like I like my coffee with a flavored creamer, I want my meat with a lil sumthin, sumthin on the side. (Much like a an adulterer , but I digress...) This place has not one, not two, not three, but FOUR different sauces that you mix and match and slather/dip/gently brush/bathe your freshly grilled meats in.  I love that!  I have been hearing about this restaurant for a while, but it kind of dropped off of my radar for more than a minute.  (So many restaurants, so little money) but now that I'm back to my weekly habit of visiting the Strip District, I decided to stop in.  I noticed that the menu wasn't expansive, but I still had a problem deciding what I wanted to eat...Del Mar (Of the Sea) or De La Tierra (Gaucho's interpretation - Not of the Sea!)  Hmmm, meat platter, seafood platter, sammich, what to do?    After much time and deliberation, I decided to go with the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich, Maiz (Grilled Corn on the Cobb) and two steak empanadas.  I also scarfed up samples of each of the sauces.    Call me Vampire Killer because I love garlic and that Ajo (garlic) sauce is drinkable in my opinion.  The chimichurri sauce and the cebolla (onion) sauce were also excellent.  The Rosemary Braised Beef was smoky, flavorful, tender and well balanced with the addition of caramelized onions and horseradish sauce. (Yeah, I know another sauce...but it was good!)  All corn should be grilled and seasoned the way Gaucho does it.  The only downer that I had was the steak empanada.  I bought two, one for myself and one for my daughter Muff and they were a little dry and overwhelmed by the taste of olives.  I love olives, but the olive taste wasn't balanced out by other flavors, so it was just bien. (okay).  After I raved about the restaurant to my sister, I had to take her there this past Saturday.  Not only did I reorder the same sandwich and grilled corn, I tasted some of my sister's Gaucho Papas (Seasoned Roasted Potatoes) Ay, Papi were they good!    Service at Gaucho's was extremely friendly and welcoming, with the staff more than willing to explain everything about their menu in detail.  The place is minutely small and you have to go outside to change your mind.  (The size of the place and empanadas is my only reason for a 4 rating)  All in all though, a very wonderful experience and you can't go wrong with the food there.  Besos (kisses) to the chefs and owners!",

    "text": "Came here specifically for the paella after the place had been recommended to me multiple times from multiple people. Not sure if it's because of the high praise or if they were having an off day but I was sincerely let down. I felt pretty uncomfortable from the getgo - as if I was judged to be not /hip/ enough to be eating there. While ordering I asked for no chorizo on the paella and was asked if I wanted to substitute it for either tilapia or salmon. Neither sounded particularly appetizing so I opted for neither. The dude handling the order gave me a raised eyebrow look but proceeded in taking the order. While walking away to our table I turned back and overheard one of the cooks talking to the guy to reconfirm our order and seemed rather frustrated by my request. The place itself was rather hot and the music pretty loud (music selection however was ). Other than that - everything was otherwise clean, aesthetically pleasing, and the wait staff refilled our waters appropriately.   The paella itself was pretty lacking. There was no rice crust on the bottom, which felt sacrilegious. The shrimp on top were fresh and good quality but didn't have much flavor, nor did the rice. I know I asked for no chorizo but I didn't realize that they were incapable of imparting any flavor without it. Such a let down.   It being my first time there and not wanting to waste food, I asked one of the wait staff for a box and he pointed to the front room and said boxes were available in that vicinity - tbh I didn't really hear exactly where the boxes were because he turned his head to that direction while speaking and I felt too uncomfortable to ask him to repeat himself. My date ventured off to find the boxes and was only able to find tiny boxes - definitely not big enough to fill with absurd amount of rice we now had for the week. As a side note - the paella is noted to be big enough for 4-6 people, I knew this while ordering and it does not negatively impact my feelings on the food/restaurant itself. Luckily another wait staff member saw our tiny box dilemma and brought us two normal sized boxes which I was grateful for. He was also the only member who seemed genuinely courteous and professional as I watched him interact with other patrons. Also not really part of the review since it's not that kind of restaurant but I figured I'd mention it.   Overall, I was left unimpressed and probably won't return. Other people's food looked pretty good but I can only comment on my experience. If anyone reading is feeling daring and wants to try the paella for themselves I would recommend bringing some adobo along.",

    "text": "Despite being a non-beef eater, Gaucho has been on my radar for ages, and I finally made it in tonight.  Ironically, I wasn't planning to come here--I was actually planning to go to a Mexican place in Lawrenceville.  However, a bike path closure forced me to detour onto Smallman St., and I soon found myself in the heart of the Strip District at the corner of 21st.  A quick glance at my nearby bookmarked restaurants at 6:30pm indicated that most of them were closed, but that Gaucho was open for another half hour.  I realized this was my golden opportunity to try it, so after riding down a sketchy alleyway and parking my bike, in I walked.  If this wasn't serendipity, I don't know what is.  As I suspected, it wasn't busy, given how close it was to closing time.  Upon being greeted by a guy by the register, I mentioned that this was my first time visiting, and he explained that there isn't table service, but that I could order off the chalkboard menu.  I mentioned that I knew they were known for their steak sandwich, but that I didn't eat beef, and he explained how the turkey and chicken sandwiches differed.  Based on his description, I decided to try the chicken (pollo) sandwich with some grilled corn on the cob (maiz).  He mentioned that they were out of caramelized onions, but that he could put something else on instead, such as asparagus.  I love asparagus, so I told him that sounded like a great idea.  My order took about 10 min. to come up.   As I was waiting, I overheard the guy who'd waited on me speak to some customers seated at the counter.  He told them how he started working there and became the manager, and how some of the menu offerings were developed.  He also mentioned that he liked everything on the menu.  It was clear that he has a great sense of pride in the business!  When my order came up, I took it outdoors to the small patio adjoining the restaurant to eat, after getting some water, utensils, and all of the sauces.  After taking the obligatory photos, I tucked in.  It was delicious!  The meat on the sandwich was so tender, it melted in my mouth, and the asparagus and mushrooms were perfectly grilled.  The bread was fresh, chewy, and substantial.  Although the sandwich came with some ajo (garlic) sauce on it, I added some more, as well as some of the red pepper sauce and the cebolla (onion) sauce.  The corn made for a great accompaniment to the sandwich, esp. with all of the sauces drizzled on it.  The employees were even kind enough to give me two ears instead of the normal one, either because they were small or due to it being near the end of serving hours.  Aside from making occasional small noises (mmm, etc.), I'm pretty sure I didn't come up for air when eating.  Given that they were deep in conversation for most of the time I was eating, I don't know if the couple seated on the patio noticed me, but if they did, they probably nicknamed me something like \"Hungry\" due to my rabid and shifty-eyed devouring of the food.  Indeed, that food was so good, I'm glad I came alone so I didn't have to be embarrassed about my ravenousness or making a mess with the sauces!  You know the food's great when you don't want any distractions!",

I ordered papas al horno (oven roasted red potatoes with whole garlic cloves and fresh rosemary) as a side, and it does not disappoint. It's extremely flavorful and goes well with the free side dips as well. I also ordered camarones to share (cast iron seared shrimp with rosemary, garlic and lemon), which the searing of the garlic and lemon really brings out the flavor. The bondiola sandwich (roasted pulled pork, spicy mustard & caramelized onions) was also good, but the flavor is lighter in comparison to the  I other dishes. My personal favorite was the cordero (wood-fired New Zealand lamb chops done with grilled lemon, toast and fresh tossed salad). The lamb chops were well charred and the added berries as topping to the lamb was perfect.",

Seriously, melt-in-your-mouth good.  Watching the people working cut the giant hunks of meat is also entertaining. I love a place that sources their food responsibly (i.e. hormone/antibiotic free, presumably local) as possible, and they delivered. The quality of this food cannot be surpassed considering time and price.   As a paleo-eater, this is going to be a mainstay this Summer. I can't wait to enjoy the outdoor space!",

It has quickly climbed the ranks of Pittsburgh and established itself as one of the top restaurants in the city. Best part its affordable, they are not fluffing you witch extra cost or lack of food.   I have always gotten the sandwiches and the empenadas. My favorite sandwiches:  1.Braised Beef  2. Carne  3.Pollo  4.Fish       Empenadas are all really good..   Dont forget to taste the sauces and use the favorite on your food!  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the Burgh, I always bring people here .",

I've had some sandwiches before here, so I know how good it is. Everyone else knows also I guess. We brought a bottle of wine which they corked for us for free. I got the house Paella. It was amazing. It says feeds 4-8. 2 of us got that as our meal and I gave a leftover box for all 5 of us. Carne sandwich, Shrimp side with sage and butter, Fish sandwich and a burger. Everything was awesome. The servers are fast and there to fill up your drink. Everyone is friendly. I highly recommend this place. Not expensive, great food, great service. One of my fav spots in the burgh.",

    "text": "I'm Argentinian, so when I heard there was a restaurant in Pittsburgh that served Argentinian meat, I was ecstatic. It's really hard to find beef and steaks in America that match the texture and flavor of Argentinian steak. There is a world of difference between how cows are grazed, and therefore how they taste, in America and in Argentina. A few details: 1. Argentinian cows are actually of a different breed than American cows. 2. Argentinian cows eat zero corn. Nothing. None. Cows can't process corn well, which is why in America cows need a ton of antibiotics to survive. 3. Argentinian cows live in large, flat plots of green and healthy land, rather than in cages or small plots of land. Because of these reasons, no matter how you cook American beef, it will never taste like Argentinian beef. The food at El Gaucho is pretty good, don't get me wrong, but it would be a stretch to call it Argentinian. I couldn't recognize at least half the items in the menu. The chimichurri, as well as the chorizo, didn't taste quite like it does back home. I heard the owner is American and actually lived in Brazil for a long time, so this may explain the inauthenticity of the food.  I bet that for someone who has never been to Argentina, this restaurant will be a good place to eat meat. But for the Argentinians expecting to get a taste of home... don't come, you'll be disappointed.",

    "text": "I was sold on this place the minute I walked in the door and was greeted by the heavenly aroma of grilled meats.  If I had it to do all over again, I would order differently; but this place is awesome.   I ordered the skirt steak sandwich, the grilled corn, and the fried potatoes.  All were absolutely delicious!     So why would I order differently?  One - because I'd want to try more stuff.   But mostly because I ordered way too much food and I'd prefer something a little easier to eat.   The sandwich was great.  Flavorful, and nicely commplimented by charred red peppers and onions.   The ciabatta bread was a nice choice, but skirt steak is a tougher cut, which perhaps would have been better in a non-sandwich form.   It was tasty, but really hard to eat.   Next time, I would order the filet or something that is a little more tender - or get it in a salad or something.   The corn was served with the folded back husk as a handle.   Would absolutely order that again.  The potatoes were also good, but completely unnecessary.  The sandwich and the corn were more than enough.    Overall, this place is a winner.  Not good for groups, since it is tiny.  Maybe six seats inside and eight tables outside.   Staff members weree super friendly and took the time to explain everything - including the four complimentary sauces (all of which were good).",

The food quality is always superb and the service is always friendly and fun. They do a great job of keeping the food consistent every time and keeping the quality very high even though they are always swamped.   The rosemary braised beef is one of my favorites and always has a delicious wood fired taste with great caramelized onions, a delicious horseradish sauce and homemade bun. I like to put their AJO sauce on it for an extra bite.   The provoletta dish of melted provolone cheese on top of house made bread with an assortment of olives and arugula is also a delicious side to any meal and their wood roasted corn is to die for!  When I first moved back home to Pittsburgh after an extended stay in Florida the first place we went on the way home from the airport was Gaucho.",

    "text": "This go around, I was a bit hungrier so I ordered the steak burger ($10) medium well with candied bacon and Spanish blue cheese as my freebie toppings (additional toppings are 50 cents ea.). The burger was served neatly between two thick slices of bread (not sure of the type). In addition to the burger, I also ordered a side of their brussel sprouts and rice. A plentiful amount of sprouts are served with candied bacon. They're quite tasty, but I'm not sure I'd give them the award for best sprouts in the city. The rice was quite bland and flavorless. The majority of the rice was soft, but some pieces were crunchy and ultimately got stuck in my teeth - unsure if that's the way the rice is meant to be served. Brought my own wine and wasn't charged a corkage fee (unsure if they even charge one).   Sat in the back of the restaurant. What should be a 4/5 experience became a 3-3.5 due to a number of fruit flies swarming around the table. Originally sat in the back right corner, but moved a bit closer to the center of the room in an effort to avoid them - unfortunately, this didn't help as they just followed my trail. By the time we finished up, we had caught two flies in a wine glass. I mentioned something to one of the employees who seemed shocked and noted that she had been at the restaurant since 10A and hadn't seen any (strange?). Anyway, she said she'd mention something to one of the managers.   The place started to get busy closer to 7:30 and I could tell we were subtly being pushed out the door when two employees started cleaning everything off the table. We got the hint and left.",

The sandwiches are all on focaccia bread which is delicious, but I highly recommend getting it \"de con\" (without bread) as it's actually hard to eat as a sandwich. I pulled mine apart and ate the meat and grilled vegetables with chimichurri  then dipped the bread in the sauces separately as a side. They have 4 great sauces for you to try with your meal. They're set out so you can take as much or little as you'd like of them.  Tip - Call your order in for take-out so you can skip the line!",

We came here on a Saturday, standing in the line with a 12 pack as the smell of their wood fired grill was taking over the whole street. Apparently there is always a line here. We waited for 45 minutes (and yes it is worth it). As I was standing in the line, I couldn't help myself not hearing how locals exalt this place. I ordered their filet sandwich and the rosemary braised beef sandwich (for to go). The winner was the filet, but with a small difference. The first bite that I took from my filet sandwich, was overwhelmingly tasty. The meat was cooked to perfection, and the roasted peppers in the sandwich had this unbelievable smoky flavor which added a lot to the sandwich. The sandwiches here are served on ciabatta which makes them even more delicious.   As far as the appetizers go here, we got the Caldo del Mar (seafood soup) and the Papas Cuna (potato salad) . Both were truly mouth watering and tasty. The Papas Cuna is a must. Probably one of the best potato salad I've ever had! I have no idea how can a potato salad taste so rich and creamy.   The service here is relatively fast, and the staff here are very friendly. You order at the register, and sit yourself and they bring it to you. The atmosphere inside is trendy, and pretty cool. But, again I don't think it's necessarily for me to talk more about the atmosphere. Who goes there for the atmosphere. I wish we had Gaucho in the Bay Area.",

I hear that they used to be much smaller and not really have seating, but the new place, although there is a wait, has basic seating after you've ordered at the front, and the servers are all so nice and helpful.  As everyone has said: GET THE STEAK SANDWICH. We got the ribeye cut, and it was a spectacular slab of beef. Juicy, tender, delicious. All the adjectives of greatness for a steak.  We also got a pretty well-dressed and well-seasoned salad, which was as satisfying as a side salad can get, and the humita (corn pudding with chilis and fresh herbs). The humita was addictive, a bit sweet, a bit savory, a bit spicy, and entirely delicious. I'd highly recommend that as well.  4.5 stars rounded up because the steak sandwich and the humita are truly remarkable.",

The line was out the door when we got here on a Friday night for dinner. The spot looks small at first, but there is seating all the way to the back of the restaurant as you walk in more.  The menu is written on one entire wall that you can view when you walk into the restaurant.   The process of ordering is pretty simple.  You pick what you want, order it, pay, and then someone will bring it to your table when it's ready.  There are little stations with their delicious chimichurri sauces: regular, garlic, onion, and red pepper. Loved all of them, but red pepper was probably at the bottom of my list.  We couldn't get enough of the chimichurri!  I had a small flank steak (6oz) and my boyfriend had the small NY Strip.  We also got a side of roasted potatoes along with some beef & chicken empanadas.  The meat plates came with the best bread and a small side salad. Everything was absolutely delicious!  We are still dreaming about Gaucho today. Can't wait to come back so we can eat here again. Wish they sold their sauces in bottles!",

Grilled veggies are also fabulous. Try to get there when they open for lunch to beat the line.",

We were quite literally sweating our you-know-whats off, but despite that, Gaucho is an awesome experience.  Everything here is wood-fired and super delicious.  My husband ordered a steak sandwich and they offered him like eight different cuts of steak to choose from.  I'm kind of a veg-head myself and was delighted to find woodfired asparagus and caramelized onions on my salad. YUM!  All their condiments are delicious as well--if you love them as much as I did, you can take home a jar for $5! :)  We will come back again and again and again--it's BYOB as well, which we didn't know (plus we were there for lunch), and I know we'll be spending plenty of fall nights on the cute little patio enjoying delicious food and a bottle of malbec!  Seriously, so awesome!!! It's kind of off-the-beaten-strip-district-path, but SO worth a try!!",

I shared the asado plate with my wife on my first (and only visit so far) to Pittsburgh and I thought it was just delicious. Being on a low carb diet, it is hard finding good stake dishes without all the other very tempting sides but this one needs no sides.  The only temptation was the buttery bread that came with the dish that my wife and son were raving about.   All five cuts of beef served were great quality tasting meat, very tender, very juicy, and perfectly cooked (I like my steak medium/medium rare).   On a plate with NY strip, filet, sirloin, and flank, I thought the skirt stake was the winner. I would love to try their chorizo. I can't wait to return.   The restaurant is very informal without waiters (you order at the counter and they bring the food to you) so seating space could be an issue. But it wasn't for us.   All I have to say is that (given I am on a high protein low carb diet) I would be going to this place every single day if they opened this restaurant in the DC metro area. But, for now, I will be content with the fact that I can only eat here when I visit Pittsburgh so this is a required stop for us when we return.",

Like always, there were numerous people eating and then experiencing food nirvana--you know, when your eyes flutter and roll in the back of your head, and you can't speak for a solid minute because your taste buds are break dancing. Nirvana.  We got the Chanchito, the Ribeye with the casa salad, a steak empanada and the fungus side dish. We ate it at the store and I collected all of the little dips that they offer. The ajo sauce (just pure garlic goodness) was hands down my favorite. They had another sauce, a red color, that was pureed sweet red peppers, which was equally amazing.  The atmosphere was really positive also. The owner is usually at the front of the house, making sure that everyone is having a pleasant time and continually shouts out positive affirmations.   All in all, the food is spectacular and it was an awesome time! Definitely will be back!!",

Even with the expansion, seating is a scarce commodity, but more frustrating is the takeout policy. On several occasions they have completely failed to answer their phone for stretches of time, rendering us unable to place a takeout order; on others, we have gotten through only to be told they wouldn't do takeout orders at that time due to long lines at the restaurant.

I was hesitant to give this restaurant a try as I am not a big meat eater and the menu is mostly meat. However, I had to give it a try since it's the #1 rated restaurant in Pittsburgh for 2015.   My first visit I got the Bondiola sandwich. The meat paired with the ciabatta bread was just spectacular. It was made even better by dipping it in the dipping sauces they have available. I also tried one of the steak empanadas which was also delicious.   My second visit I tried the pollo sandwich but I wasn't as impressed with it. I also tried my friends grilled veggies which I would highly recommend.   As for the service and environment...the service is very quick and we did not wait long to get our food either time. I've heard a lot of people say the line here gets crazy so keep that in mind because my guess is the line moves fairly quickly. I personally had no wait because I got there at 4:30 and 6pm before the rush started. The restaurant is very cute but not really a place for a big group.",

The food was prepared with care - spices complimented each type of 3 meat platter. Servers are energetic but nobody really checks on you when you get it.  The line is long and it creates False sense of amazing things to come. Sausage was a bit too spicy but maybe that is a standard because I do not know anything about Argentinian spices. The crowd's estimated age average was 30 - I was at the high end of age scale.  I did it - I do not regret it-it was very good.",

    "text": "Holy hell, thank you for Gaucho! Meat is life. Meat is good. Meat is my savior.  For all the millennials...meat is  (don't judge me)  ... Bae.  Anyway, I used to drive by Gaucho all the time when I lived in the Strip District, naturally. After I got off the bridge and headed straight, let's just say my nares hit Liberty Street before I did.  All the worries of a stressed out resident physician in Pittsburgh were relinquished when the smell of Buenos Aires markets hit my nose.   The smell of a slow parilla style roast of our good friend who \"moo's\" overwhelmed me everytime I would pass by.   My go to? The asado platter - all the meats from our farmer friend cooked to perfection. The meat is some of the most succulent I have had in Pittsburgh and I have to say, Pittsburgh does meat pretty damn well. My second favorite, the Paella. Let's put it this way, I am allergic to clams and mussels but if ever I had a craving, an epi pen is going straight into my right thigh before I devour this pot of edible gold. The saffron gives the rice such a airy spice that it takes me back to flavors of Spain (though this is Argentina we are talking about). Regardless, well done!  Kudos Gaucho, thank you for being here!  Highlights: Meat cooked to perfection, parilla style layout (outdoor, garage type feel like some of the places I've visited in Argentina), beautiful spices and herbs with a strong melange Pros: Above Cons: sometimes the wait is BRUTAL. But well worth it Recommend to a friend: Yes Recommend to family: No (because we have been all over and obviously have had authentic style food in South America and they will probably not go anyway). Just being honest Go again: I go once a week at least.",

Around 1 PM on a weekend, we waited about 25-30 minutes. Once inside, you get to see the full menu - by that point I was so hungry I wanted everything. We got lamb and shrimp plus a large side of vegetables.  I was surprised. The food was uniformly perfectly cooked. The shrimp were juicy, the lamb was tender and the vegetables were perfectly smokey yet still crispy. We cleaned our plates.  The staff was friendly and helpful despite the constant crowd, the food came out reasonably quick, and the variety of seating makes it a social environment. Gaucho is a must try on any trip to Pittsburgh.",

We ordered the Cerdo (Pork) and Camarones (Shrimp) extra special plates as well as side orders of Pork Empanadas and Gaucho Papas. The Cerdo plate was comprised of pork tenderloin, caramelized onion, spicy mustard, small salad, and toast.  The pork tenderloin tasted amazing atop the toast with the onions and spicy mustard sauce mixed in. I'm more of a carnivore, so I left the salad for my girlfriend. The Camarones were also really good...simple and clean.  The potatoes were nothing special on their own, but fortunately there were 4 really yummy sauces to dip into: Chimmi, Ajo, Pimenton, and Cebolla. We were both obsessed with the Ajo (which I think means garlic). The Empanadas were probably the least remarkable thing we ate, although they weren't bad by any stretch.  Another really cool feature of this place is the BYOB policy. It was our first time here, so we were woefully unprepared, but we saw plenty of patrons taking advantage.",

I got one of the empanadas of the day (chicken, scallion, and lime if I remember correctly), which was awesome. The spicy chorizo with peppers and the fire grilled toast was equally delicious.  They have 4 signature dipping sauces you can help yourself to. Each one is unique and it was fun to try new flavors with every bite.

My review is a bit late but here goes:  When you walk in it may be overwhelming at first to understand but there is always an employee there to explain. You stand in line, while looking at a huge chalkboard menu and then order at the front register area. This is also where you'll get your wine uncorked if you're participating in the BYOB (which is FREE!!!!)   Seating is all self service, and during lunch and weekends it gets pretty busy!   So far I've gotten the below: Grilled vegetables-some of the most amazing veggies ever  Rosemary braised beef sandwich- probably a 4 star sandwich but still absolutely excellent  Corn on the cob- always good  Flank steak and ribeye (both half portions and plenty for one person with the salad and bread)- ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE. I got them cooked medium and they were perfect every time.   Definitely check this place out and in the summer they have outside patio seating as well!",

If I could give it extra stars, I would. And I've eaten a lot of food in my day.   If you're in Pittsburgh, please make it a point to stop here for a meal.

    "text": "This is arguably the greatest spot in the city. Everytime someone from out of town comes to visit Pittsburgh, I take them here. Be prepared to wait a long time because this place seemingly always has a long line. My roommate often orders carry out from here to avoid the line but sometimes they're so busy he can't get anyone on the phone to order.   This set up is a bit odd. You order and pay at the counter and wait to be seated. Food runners will then bring you your order and fill up your water and collect plates and such. This place is also BYOB.   I've explored the menu quite a bit. My favorite thing to get is the rib-eye steak (small portion unless you're sharing) with a side of either the potatoes or the mushrooms. The steak is cooked and seasoned to perfection as it melts in your mouth with the delicious chumichurra sauce. The red potatoes are that perfect level of soft but not too soft and the mushrooms are cooked in this vinegar sauce that is quite unique.   If potatoes and mushrooms aren't your thing, they have a few other delicious side options that are all very good. I also recommend getting the steak sandwich. Its huge and I could not finish it in one sitting but it will blow you away. Do not sleep on the beef empanadas either.   If you're looking for a more classic restaurant experience, this place also offers a Bodega dining experience that you must book in advance. I believe its 50 dollars per person and it is a pre fixed menu that explores all the different foods on the menu. Be prepared to eat a lot though because its quite filling. Again its BYOB with free cork service.   This place is a must if you're in Pitt and the wait may be long but it is definitely worth it every time. Its amazing to me how this place does so many things so well.",

Plus, the BYOB aspect is much more appealing now that they are open for dinners and you can really settle into your own table.  All of their food is absolutely fantastic.  After coming back from a backpacking trip to South America, I still thought Gaucho's food was amazing.  My favorite item to get for the value is their Steakburger, which is really just a giant smoked burger with two of your choices of fixins (cheese is a little extra, I think). It's a big burger and will satisfy even the hungriest of us eaters. If you're looking to splurge and love steak, you cannot go wrong with one of their platters.  I want to mention two more highlights of Gaucho. They recently added wings to the appetizer section, and DAMN are they good.  They are cooked on a wood-fired grill like much of the rest of the menu, then tossed in some kind of magically delicious hot pepper oil and scallion sauce, with grilled lemons on the side.  If you haven't tried them yet, go and get some!  Finally... their sauces. Oh my gosh their sauces are DELICIOUS. And they are self-serve, so try them all and then load up on your favorite one!",

    "text": "Yum yum yum! I love some good sandwiches!  Took a random day trip to Pittsburgh and was searching for a place to meet up with an old friend for lunch. After seeing the hundreds of reviews for this place, we had to check it out.  We were able to find parking right down the street from the restaurant. I was a little scared that the line would be one of those agonizing, way too long lines, where your stomach just hurts from being too hungry...... but at 12:30pm on a sunny Saturday afternoon, we only stood in line for 30 minutes. Quite impressive in my opinion. I had read one review that stated that you would wait in line for one hour.... but it moved along at a decent pace, in my opinion.  Essentially, you order at the cashier, and then you sit down, waiting for your food to be brought out. The whole process actually moves quite fast. Perhaps because people realize there are others waiting in line... I'm not sure, but the rate of people eating, then leaving behind seats for others who are coming in, is quite fluid. It was actually very impressive.  Anyways, I decided on the carne sandwich. On the chalkboard menu, it stated, \"choice of vaca\", which we then had to google translate, and for those who are interested, it means beef. I chose the arrechera, cooked medium. The others chose the rosemary braised beef.  We sat down in a midst of people eating their big sandwiches or big ears of corn. Now this is my kind of place! I thought.   Results: - My arrechera sandwich: DELICIOUS. First, the meat was very tender and flavorful. It was cooked a perfect medium- almost more to a medium rare, however, I probably should have had it cooked more, so I wouldn't have to chew so hard to break it down. Nonetheless, the flank was good. And the BREAD it came on. Wow, that's good bread- a little bit of garlic in it, but just so fluffy and tasty.... a good bread really makes a sandwich. - Their rosemary braised beef- apparently, this beef cooks for 7 hours before they serve it to you...and you can tell. Their instant responses after biting into the sandwiches were, \"MmmmmMMMMMM!!!\". The meat was so moist and tender- that was a good sandwich. On top of it, the bread again, was a stellar winner.  Definitely make a stop at this place if you're in the area. It's reallllly tasty.",

A piece of burnt, tough bread was served with the meal. The salad that came with the meal was fair.   I've passed this place several times when they were busy and chose 3:00 PM on a weekday to try it. The menu is varied but if all the bread is burnt and tough I doubt if a return trip will happen.",

Walking down pen avenue toward the bridge the sweet smell of wood fire and grilling hits you about a block away! The line for lunch can be a bit long at times, but it moves pretty fast so don't give up. The chalk written menu is easy to follow, small plates, salads, main dishes specials and grilled beef and pork! For lunch I have been waiting to try the braised beef with rosemary and horsey sauce on a fresh focaccia. It was everything I could have imagined and more. The beef was tender and juicy and the rosary and grilled opinions were a perfect addition without hiding the flavor or the star of the show! I also had the pork empanadas which were the best I've ever had... Period. I can't wait to try everything.  My goal is the paella which serves 3-6 humans!! I am sure I can find a few volunteers for that mission!",

We had the 6oz strip and ribeye with potatoes and grilled spaghetti squash. It was the most enjoyable steak I have ever had. It took us an hour from arrival to seating but it was Sooo worth the wait, even in the very cold (I definitely wasn't dressed for it), I would do it all over again.

The onion, meat and bread together tasted great.  The meat was seasoned and cooked well.  The wood flavor is really enjoyable.  What I didn't like was that the sandwich was hard to eat because the meat was hard to eat.  If they sliced the meat thinner it would be easier to eat. Overall, good sandwich but meat is hard to eat.

    "text": "Gaucho Parrilla Argentina would make an excellent ambassador for Pittsburgh's food scene to any transplants or tourists arriving in the city.  It's simultaneously (a) one of the best sandwich makers in the city that stands out from the crowd and (b) a restaurant that fits right in with the growing and diverse offerings of an increasingly delicious Strip District.  With many cuts of steak available in sandwich or platter form (I'm a fan of the sandwiches myself), none of the options are bad choices.  You could make random selections from this menu and still be just as happy as if you put hours into crafting your order.  It's all great stuff, and I have no advice to visitors other than \"get a steak sandwich and anything else that looks good to you.\"  You won't be disappointed.  The primary drawback is space; it can be hard to find a place to eat once your food is ready, especially if the weather closes the outdoor seating area.  Still, it's worth the wait in line and the hassle of seating (though it's still a far cry from being \"good for groups\").",

I've also ate from their food truck which was just as fantastic! The only reason I gave 4 stars is because of the set up of the restaurant. You have to wait so long in line, which usually goes out the door. I prefer the traditional restaurant seating of being able to sit first and then order from the menu, so you don't have to wait upwards of an hour in a cramped line. It is still worth it to taste this wonderful Argentinian food!",

You wait in line to get to a counter and place your order and pay for your food and drinks. They then seat you. The staff is knowledgeable and friendly.   I ordered the Skirt Steak. The small portion was $22. The large portion would have been $40. It was very flavorful,  probably one of the better steaks I've had. The small salad was good, but was tiny. I also got the beef soup, but it was too salty for my taste. My wife took it to go.  My wife ordered the ribs. They had little meat and she found them dry, with little meat on the bone. Her ratatouille was flavorful and she thought that was the best part of the meal. It was too spicy for my taste.  Clearly based upon the size of the crowd they are doing something right,  though I thought that they were overpriced for what you got. The approach of having you order and pay at the counter before being seated results in long lines snaking out the door at peak times.   I'm glad we went, but it will probably be a while before we return.",

However, the overall dining experience in both of the 2 times I've eaten here would have to be ranked somewhere between unsatisfactory and downright unpleasant.    The wait time for actually ordering food is so out far out of control as to defy belief. If there is a line of any length outside the door, be prepared for at least a 45 minute wait to reach your turn to order. As someone who designs and re-engineers processes, it was a particularly painful experience to observe such a complete lack of competence in this restaurant's food ordering procedure. Unless the intention is to actually limit revenue, management would be well served by hiring a consultant to streamline the process (there is so much hanging fruit) or at least visit and learn from restaurants that use line flow best practices.",

And you might be thinking...well, I don't know, how good could a little local Pittsburgh area steak shop actually be?  Why don't I just go to some chain restaurant that I know can cook the BEST filet mignon...with butter!....well....Gaucho's is much much different, my friend.   I think Gaucho is actually from Argentina.  He must be, because I never tasted flavor like this in my LIFE.  Whatever his prep process is from his meats, it's 100% grade prime material. Really talented stuff this guy does.    On separate occasions I've stopped by Gaucho's.  Expect to wait, the line is usually out the door - even after he expanded his little stand-up shop into a sit-down, libation serving restaurant.  All of my trips to this joint consisted of me ordering his steak sandwich for lunch. You can order straight-up steak plates but for the $$ I'll save that for a dinner some other time.   I mentioned he runs a meat-sex shop, because his sandwiches are created as if they were put together in such a place. He combines the perfect amount of steak-juice-bread combination you could ever want in your mouth.",

I tried the Argentino salad for dinner, which is essentially Argentina meets Yinzer, as it is a salad with steak, avocado and papas.

I made the right decision because when I got out of here at 11:40am, there were people waiting out the door. Anyways, I ordered the Carne sammich with sirloin meat medium rare, which also contained the chimmi sauce, caramelized onion, and roasted peppers. The meat was really tender and juicy, and it was just the right amount of 'medium rare'. I could really appreciate the wood-fired grill taste in the meat. Also, the roasted peppers were definitely a plus because they made the sammich that much more flavorful. The sammich was a 5-star. Now, the Gaucho Slaw was mediocre at best. It lacked somewhat of a flavor, and it wasn't the best slaw I've had at a place like this. To conclude, if there's one thing I'm jealous of Pittsburgh, it will be the fact that they have Gaucho Parrilla in their town.",

My girl is a meat fan, but one of the best things she put on her plate was the sun-dried grilled tomatoes in the salad. We liked them so much we asked for extra! The ribeye was tender and flavorful and grilled to perfection. The smoked red pepper sauce was our personal favorite, but all of the sauces were fresh and flavorful. We also ordered the grilled pineapple with blackberries, mint, and creme fresh. My lady had never had grilled pineapple before but I can tell by her reaction she will have it again!   I've read some yelpers had long waits, I can see why there is a line out the door on most weekends. We came on a Thursday afternoon and maybe had a 15 minute wait to order then probably another 15 minutes for our food.   The biggest applause should go to the staff. Super friendly and helpful. The cooks have a thankless job over a hot grill but are masterful at their jobs and produce a fantastic product.   The best advice I can give is talk to Dillon when you get here. He was extremely helpful and professional, and clearly enjoys his work. Great customer service and I'm already looking forward to our next trip to this gem!",

The menu is extensive, there were many options to choose from.  I went with the Parrillada Mixta so I could sample as much as possible; it includes NY strip, chorizo, and chicken with sauces and toast.  Due to a minor mix-up we also ended up with the Camerones (shrimp).  Everything was delicious!  The food was amazing, I'm kind of mad at myself for waiting so long to try it out.   We arrived around 6pm on a Friday and had a small wait to order food, and ended up sitting at the counter to eat because there were no open tables.  There were only two of us so this worked out well.  The service was great.  We didn't have to wait long for the food after we ordered and the servers were attentive but not intrusive.  The line was growing out the door by the time we left, so I would recommend arriving as early as possible.  Otherwise, you can expect a long wait (especially with larger groups).  All in all it was a great experience- I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu.",

We tried the provoletta and it should not be missed, grilled and melty sharp provolone is placed atop grilled ciabatta bread, it's as delicious as it sounds.   The house made sauces are amazing, this trip we bought a container to bring home with us.   The place is small so either eat off hours, plan on waiting for a table outside or get it to go.

    "text": "I came here after walking around the Strip on a weekday afternoon with a friend. After some Yelping it seemed like this was the place to be - I've rarely seen so many 5 star reviews before, and when I arrived (this was around 1:30PM) there was a line outside the door.   The place - the restaurant is bigger than it looks on the outside- when you first enter you wait inline and place your order at the counter. You then grab a seat and the food will be brought out to you. The interior feels very hipster-chic - there's a giant chalkboard menu, lots of solid wood furnishings, high ceilings, mason jars, iron embellishments... it's well lit and pleasant.   The food- I went with the rosemary beef sandwich- DELICIOUS. The ciabatta bread was nicely toasted and the beef was savory, flavorful and decadent. There was a LOT of meat, so I wouldn't recommend it if you are an office worker looking to avoid an afternoon food coma. That said, the meat got a little drier towards the end of the sandwich. This is where the sauces came in handy. There are four restaurant-made sauces available for everyone by the cutlery. I sampled all four and they were great sandwich condiments.   The service- fantastic. Everyone had a smile on their faces, and eager to help. The woman who brought out our sandwiches went out of her way to introduce us to the sauces and explain.   Overall, it was a great experience! I put four instead of five stars just because I wasn't as mind-blown by the sandwich as I thought I would be - but overall I would definitely come back!!",

However, the line did move pretty incredibly slow, for the not so huge menu people ordering off of. I should have checked that this was BYOB, no fees! Which would have made standing in line with our 3yo a breeze. Once we ordered, the waitress checking us out was incredibly nice and professional. Additionally, every worker there thereafter were extremely great, made sure your water was tipped off, and worked collectively great together. I ordered the chicken \"boob\" sandwich, my fiance ordered the steak burger. It did not disappoint. Incredibly filling! Chicken was very tender and well seasoned, his burger made medium was perfectly juicy topped with avocado instead of cheese. It was honestly half an avocado. While we waited for our food, we tried the sauces with some toast. 1) the toast was perfection, it had the real wood burning toast flavor but without it tasting burnt! A real skill. 2) there is not one flavor of sauce I did not like. It was hard choosing a favorite! Ultimately, i liked the chimmy, and the roasted red pepper... oh and the garlic, shoot, the ajo was fine too! Honestly, i would give this a solid 5, but I am going solely off my first experience (waiting, no options for my picky 3yo) but clearly we know how to be prepared next time.",

Seriously some of the best meat I have ever had. I've had a bunch of different cuts and none of them have been disappointing. I usually go for one of the steak platters, although they have sandwiches and some other dishes as well. The platters are a great value since it is a good portion of very high quality meat, a piece of toast and a small salad. I've occasionally gotten a side of veggies or brussel sprouts to share and YUM.  Seating was a nightmare when it was about half its size, but now that they have expanded, there is much more. I have occasionally had to wait for a table, especially with a larger party if going during peak hours. I've driven past this place when there is a line out the door! I would try to go during non-peak meal hours, but it is worth the wait anytime!   The staff are always pleasant and extremely friendly.

However, the food is not quite as good as I wanted it to be. I tried the yams and they tried to put some spices that just made it taste like flowers. The bread was dry, the fish I got was dry. The flavors were greasy and off. It was very heavy. They give a lot of food, but I didn't even want to finish it.  They give you sandwiches in wrappers but then they give you plates anyways. So you just unwrap your sandwich and but it on your plate. What's the point of wasting that paper?  Its definitely not worth the amount I paid. I got empanadas too. The meat was good but I've had better empanadas other places for much less the price.   Overall it was disappointing but the experience got two stars because of the great service.",

I followed my nose and found Gaucho (I like to think I discovered it before it got big). I've been at least 5 times since then and have told all of my friends, co-workers, family, and out-of-town guests.   The corn on the cob is simple and tasty. I usually get a steak sandwich and load it up with some of their fresh made sauces (chimichurri is great). The papas, shrimp, and salads are all good too.   As Gaucho has gotten more popular, the lines have been out of control, even after they expanded. The last 2 times I've tried to go to Gaucho, I've turned around and gone elsewhere due to the line. I hope they can figure out a way to expedite food a bit faster while maintaining quality - for their sake and ours!",

    "text": "When our production crew and I were in town for work, we were told in reverential tones about this place...and wow! Glad we decided to brave the line. I've not found a great deal of Argentinian steak places in the US that aren't out west, but this one was a gem.   First thing to know, it's not really a sit-down (inside) place. They have a couple of counters with a few seats, and then a nice little patio around the building's corner, but otherwise it looks like a carry-out place. We weren't aware of this, but found patio spots regardless.  As you'd expect from a place specializing in Argentinian beef, the thing to order is steak. Or as it's written on the chalkboard \"CARNE!!!\" I had the ribeye sandwich with onions and tomatoes along with 2 different types of very subtly different chimichurri sauces. In a word, outstanding. Most of the guys had various types and cuts of beef and all were just perfectly seasoned and the flavor hits you immediately. Can't decide what kind of chimichurri to try? No worries, there is a large table in front of the register that has several large jars of all the different made-from-scratch options they offer! Take as many as you like to try. They also have a good selection of side dishes to share, try the grilled potatoes.  One last element can't go unmentioned. If you're thinking this place looks good but you have a vegetarian with you, no problem! We tried to order the meat-based empanadas (Can't remember what kind of meat) but for some reason they were out of the cut they usually do them with. So...with very skeptical attitudes, we opted for the vegetarian empanadas...and they were AMAZING. Just the right mixture of ingredients, perfect texture, served piping hot. They FAR exceeded all expectations for a pack of carnivores like us. Pittsburgh, you've got a real winner here!",

    "text": "I think I am in the minority here, but I can't help but think this place is a bit overrated.  Too much oil, too much fanfare, too little meat, too pricey for my liking.  My qualms:   1. Why have Flank and Skirt steak? Seems a bit redundant and the two times I have ordered the Asado plate I could not distinguish them. The Asado plate is also expensive and a bit of a let down.  2. The Empanadas. Ugh, maybe I caught them on a bad day. I certainly hope so. It was dry, crusty and crumbled at the touch. I am a huge fan of meat pastries from every culinary persuasion and this was a surprising folly for a place so highly touted.  3. The salads. Skip the Argentino with steak. Never had the heart for any of the others because this was just floating in oil.  Overall, I still can't help but love this place. I can't. You don't find places like this in Pittsburgh and it is so refreshing to have the option for a \"high end\" steak sandwich in the strip. Still, I am just not into paying 25 bucks for lunch...in Pittsburgh...from anywhere.  If the line is short and your pockets a little too heavy I would definitely recommend. Nice people too!",

I guess it makes some sense since this is place is known for their steak sandwich and men love their meat.    Since I'm not much of a beef eater, I went with the small plate of shrimp (carones) and the potatoes (papas).  The shrimp and potatoes were lightly seasoned but you could definitely taste the fire grilled taste - YUM!  I'm a big fan of grilled food so this is a place to keep in mind when you have a craving for some fired food!  They do have a selection of sauces and I got to try a few of them (can't remember the names) - the one I liked the best had cilantro and chillies...it was also the one that was nearly done so it must be popular.    Next time I go, I'd like to try the grilled veggie sandwich!",

I tried their braised roast beef with horseradish sauce and was in love. The sauce complemented the beef so well and it was so unique! I also tried their chanchito- pork tenderloin with arugula, pickled red onion and mushrooms. Incredible. By far my favorite. The last item I had that night was their grilled shrimp with rice. I honestly don't know if I have ever had shrimp that juicy before and the flavors were out of this world good.   Tonight I had the opportunity to go to Gaucho for the first time! Located at the beginning of the strip (close to downtown)- it's not very large at all. There were enough seats for about 8 people, bar style. It was around 530 when we arrived and we didn't have to wait too long for some seats to open up. I ordered a steak plate- 6 oz hanger steak with a small salad and toasted bread. I also ordered some grilled maiz (corn). The boyfriend ordered the braised roast beef sandwich and my friend Nick ordered the carne sandwich- flank steak with red peppers on ciabatta.   I had the chance to try everything... Wow. The braised roast beef sandwich was incredible- my boyfriend was obsessed with the sauce and had to ask for extra. Nick let me try his sandwich and the flank steak was awesome! So juicy and went so well with the peppers.   My steak plate was crazy good!! Charred and smoky with tons of spices and super juicy. The grilled corn was amazing too! My mouth is watering just thinking about it.   This place is worth the hype. It's insanely delicious. Go there. Now.",

I always worry that cooks add more sat when something is wrong with the food...... I don't expect restaurant food to be necessarily healthy, but when the salt burns your lips...something is really wrong. Whats wrong with regular seasoning, not going overboard?",

We got a flank steak plate and a tilapia (the fish of the day) plate. Both were presented beautifully and were above and beyond our expectations. The four sauce accompaniments that are available are incredible, and I took a special liking to the ajo.  We came during off hours on a Tuesday, so there was no wait at all for a table which we were very happy about, having heard people warn of long wait times. The entire meal for the two of us was $34, which is beyond reasonable for the quantity of the food. For the quality they provide, $34 for those two plates is cheeeeeap!  I wish this place were in NYC - I'm trying to convince my boyfriend we should go back for lunch before we leave tomorrow!!!",

    "text": "My friends brought me here to try Argentinian food. I was EXTREMELY disappointed because I ordered steak medium cooked and it had little to no seasoning. I don't recommend ordering steak from this place. Order something else like their sandwiches. Also, there's no seasoning on the table so you eat what they serve you. You pay ahead as well even if you don't like your food. So they rob you if you aren't satisfied with your order. I don't agree with this business model whatsoever especially since you are required to tip ahead of time even without being served first! Who does that?!?",

    "text": "This place is so small you probably can miss it if you're walking down the street.  What you won't miss is the smell.  The odor of wood burning and meat can be experienced well down the street.  You know how smell and taste senses are tied together?  Yes, that...  The place is really tight inside.  There's only bar stool seating along the perimeter of the dining area and a table in the middle with sauces.  The set up can be a bit uncomfortable in a sense that everybody is facing a wall or outside and there are people waiting for their orders and or seats to open up.  I was in line and my wife took the only 2 seats that were available for myself and her as I was in line waiting to order.  Another couple was ahead of me ordering their food and I wasn't sure if they were eating in or taking out.  Another person waiting around was waiting for his take out.  Well after that couple ahead of us had finished ordering they had nowhere to go just standing in the middle of the floor as all the stools were taken and some other customers that were done eating seemed to just be sitting around and talking and not really making room for new customers looking to have a seat and eat their food.  I had ordered a chicken sandwich and a steak (rib eye) sandwich.  While the flavors of these sandwiches were absolutely amazing the steak we both had a hard time with (we split each sandwich in half and shared each).  The steak seemed to be really tough to bite through chew.  Don't get me wrong the taste was absolutely amazing but the meat seemed rather tough to bite and chew for rib eye.  The portions are very generous.  The amount of meat on these sandwiches are NOT skimped at all.    Along with the sandwiches I had ordered a corn and the roasted potatoes (papas).  The potatoes were amazing but I really had to wait a while for them to cool off as they were really hot.  I guess the tip for future is steak is good but not in a sandwich because it's juicy and the bread gets a little mushy and the meat is too hard to bite.  A plate that we can cut with a knife and fork would probably be better.  I'm not sure of the rib eye as the meat was generous and thick cut, the meat seemed less tender than I as expecting for rib eye steak.    If it wasn't for the toughness of the steak sandwich I could easily grant 5 stars for Gaucho.  I would love to try the pork loin next time.  For the 2 sandwiches, potatoes, corn and one Limonata the bill came out to just under 29 bucks.  Not a bad deal for the quality they pump out of this hot spot.",

    "text": "The food at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina is literally other-worldly. I'm so happy for the Yelp event that introduced me to this restaurant!  My coworker and I came here for her birthday in late January. We were a little surprised to walk into the restaurant and find seating for less than 10 people. Thankfully, a lot of people ordering were picking up takeout to take back to their offices, so we were able to snag some bar stools.  We began chatting it up with the... owner? I forget... who had also been at the Yelp event several months prior, telling him that we had to check out the restaurant after tasting the food at the event. He is such a friendly, outgoing, eccentric kind of guy and is a lot of fun to talk to. He told us all about Gaucho's expansion plans. I can't wait for Gaucho to take over the neighboring space so that there will be more seating in the restaurant.  Let's get to the food... We ordered Steak Empenadas, Provoletta, Vegetales, Rosemary Braised Beef Sandwich, and Camarones. Even though we had enough food to feed 5 people, we somehow inhaled almost all of it. The Steak Empenadas were wrapped in a flaky pastry and filled with a flavorful steak mixture. The Vegetales were tasty, roasted vegetables covered in balsamic vinegar. The Camarones were flavorful shrimp cooked in simple seasonings. My friend ordered the Rosemary Braised Beef Sandwich, but since I'm not a horseradish fan, I only stole a bite or two and let her enjoy the rest. The only item that didn't totally knock my socks off was the Provoletta. There was nothing wrong with the dish - toast covered in provolone with arugula on the side - but it just didn't impress me like the other items did.  The food was so good that we just couldn't resist getting dessert. When Gaucho heard that it was my friend's birthday, they gave her the Alfajores cookies. We didn't try them until we had returned to work that afternoon, and they were the perfect hit-the-spot melt-in-your-mouth afternoon treat. The Panqueques were sweet crepes filled with a whole lot of caramel and topped with chocolate drizzle. This dessert just requires a love of caramel! The Crema Quemada - aka Creme Brulee - was perfectly smooth and creamy and crunchy.  I can't wait to return to Gaucho and bring my husband here to try all the delicious food. He was disappointed that I came without him, and I know that he'll be blown away the same way that I was.",

Then while I was ordering he came behind the counter and grumbled to the guy who was in the middle of taking my order, \"damn, it looks like we're going to have to stay until 11 again!\"  Ok...   I really like the concept of this place.  We ordered the Parrillada Mixta (New York steak, chicken breast, spicy chorizo). This was the most lacking of all of the dishes. The meats were all cold and the chicken was dry but the flavors were good. Perhaps this is due to us showing up late.  We also had the large grilled vegetables which were EXCELLENT and the Caldo Del Mar which was also EXCELLENT. It was steaming hot and definitely hit the spot.  All the serve-yourself accompanying sauces were pretty great too.   I would have given this place 4 stars if the \"older guy\" didn't leave such a bad taste in my mouth. Everyone else was very friendly but it just takes one bad apple in a restaurant service.  Later we heard him grumble that they only made \"72\" today to another worker. Don't know what that means exactly except that he's a big grumble pot.",

Not because I didn't think it was worth it, but mostly becasue when I go eat I am usually already starving to death.   Tuesday, 2pm I ventured to the strip to gather some fresh fruits and veggies and for the first time ever there was no line. I parked nearby and thought to myself \"no line, probably closed.\" Nope! They were open and ready to feed my soul!   I walked in, glanced at the enormous menu and asked the kid behind the counter what he recommended. I settled on the carne ribeye steak sandwich. My order was up within a few minutes. The sandwich came wrapped in paper like a butcher would do. I was directed to the sauces (4 in total) I scooped a small scoop of each in the container and went to the table.   The sandwich was excellent! All the sauces were to die for and the steak was just so succulent and cooked to perfection. The only negative thing I can think of was that I was still a bit hungry after the sandwich, I didn't realize it came alone with no sides :-( I assumed for $12 It would have come with fries, chips or even a pickle!   I will surely go back to gaucho but I will also be sure to order more food so I don't leave hungry next time!",

    "text": "I've been meaning to come to this place years ago when they first opened but never had the opportunity to do so.. either because something came up or the long was awfully long. However the opportunity presented it self as I had to visit Heinz History Center for a morning event. Since it was only few minutes walk from the center, it was the perfect excuse and time to finally pay Gaucho a visit.  Although there wasn't any line outside, the inside line was a different story. The order line was pretty cramped and right around to a point where any additional people would have to wait outside. As I was standing on the line - the long list of menu on the chalk board was somewhat overwhelming but you can always ask to the people before or after you for recommendation. And pretty much everyone will recommend something different. I looked up on Yelp and since I was craving beef - I went with the Rosemary Roasted Beef. I also ordered a \"Dog Bone\" .. Yes you heard me correct - A Dog Bone for my new puppy :)  The folks behind the counter are super friendly and helpful. Once you order, someone will guide you to a seat and your food will be at the table in no time. If you are with someone - I would recommend both ordering something different since the sandwiches are pretty big that you can actually split among the two. However, I cleaned out the entire sandwich by myself. The roast beef juicy, well seasoned and just cooked to perfection. Caramelized onion and horsey sauce made it just perfect without overpowering the roast beef. If you want more variety of flavors there are 4 specialty sauces that you can add.  The atmosphere here is very casual, industrial like or may be I should say farmhouse like (specially with all the stacked woods) and lively. Everything is reasonably priced especially for the portion you get. Like me don't let the long lines discourage you. It's definitely worth a visit.",

I feel like Gaucho is not just a place where you go to eat food, but more for the overall experience. The environment is bustling, warm, and very up and coming. I loved being able to pay for my meal in advance before we sat down so that when it was time to leave we didn't have to wave down the server for the check.   We went for the Asato platter and it was a lot of meat. It was cooked amazingly well. I'm not a steak fan actually but it was delicious I would say get sides if you go with this platter otherwise the meat is a little too overwhelming. Would recommend the potatoes and vegetables! Will be returning to try the paella.   Expect to be there for much longer than a typical dinner because of the wait. But definitively one of the best places in Pittsburgh. 10/10 would recommend to a friend",

For entrees we had a gorgeous burger served on ciabatta toast, perfect lamb chops and a grilled assortment platter with steak, chicken and sausage.  Desert was available but we were too full.

    "text": "The smell outside of this place is enough to make you want to come inside and wait (as long as it takes) and place an order of your own. I should stress the need for patience in here. Lunch time the place is slammed. The menu is very extensive. It's a unique place to have in Pittsburgh. I do think it's a bit way over-hyped, in most cases overpriced. I would recommend that someone try the samplers they offer so that you are better able to get an good idea of the offerings. As a fairly well travelled person, I find that it's simply incredibly hard to reproduce any ethnic offering outside of the originating country. Can I say that? The meats are just a bit high on the sodium count - this was my personal experience. I'd go back for sure, but not often. I particularly liked the Brussel sprouts with bacon topped over them but it was for sure fairly NaCl+ed. Good thing is the byob, too. Make sure you bring lots. You may need it not only for the reasons mentioned, but also to help drown out the noise levels. No one said it would be quiet.",

You step in and immediately you're in clear view of the grill with the wonderful & tasty creations going on right before your eyes.  Staff is knowledgeable and explained the menu quite well as this was our first time here.   Our order was taken promptly and we headed out to the quaint patio to choose our table as the place was quickly getting busy. They offer a delectable choice of sauces to complement the main entree. The garlic was by far my favorite. Although, each sauce added a certain flair to every bite of steak. We ordered a regular size order of the skirt steak- the portions were more than plenty. A side of rice,  and a roasted corn completed our meal. Presentation was great. They used wooden oblong plates that added a certain element to the dish.  Our order was brought out to our table surprisingly fast.  The skirt steak was tender, juicy and seasoned just right and served with a fresh baby greens salad and a slice of buttery toast. The roasted corn was tasty. The yellow saffron rice was good. The empanadas were okay. Overall,  the food was delectable and I will be back to try the rest of the menu offerings. (I'm giving it four stars due to the fact that they didn't have a bathroom for patrons)...",

For the building space they acquired, the amount of seating inside is surprisingly sparse.  But who cares how close to other people you are when everyone is shoving their mouths full of wonderful, beautiful, perfectly cooked beef?  We went with my parents' friends and ended up ordering TWO carne platters and essentially every side on the menu, as well as some grilled shrimp.  It's hard to pick a favorite out of everything, but I think that of the beef cuts, the ribeye was the winner, and the sides, the spicy corn pulled ahead as the most unique.  That said, there wasn't a single bite that wasn't spectacular.  They recently applied for a liquor license, which is at once exciting and disappointing.  I do love the fact that they are BYO without a corkage fee, but can imagine that they will come up with some uniquely Argentine cocktails to accompany the fare.  I wonder where, exactly, the bar will be going?",

Ok so it's 7th in the 2015 Yelp Top 100. That means that it is the 7th best rated restaurant in the U.S. That is impressive. So here I am writing the 400th and some 5 star review. Pthth (eye roll). Pointless. But I'm a fan. I want it to stay up there on the list.   So I was wondering, what could possibly be so outstanding about Gaucho (the meaning of gaucho is, a cowboy of the South American pampas ((which is an extensive treeless plain in South America (((South America is where Argentina is and Argentina is where good food cooking gauchos live))) )) )? It couldn't be That amazing. The simple answer to that question is, everything. Everything about it is good.   FOOD: Famous for steak sandwiches, Rosemary braised beef sandwiches (what I got) or just meat in general, not only beef. I also got a side of humita which is a corn pudding. The sandwich was huge with lots of bread and lots of flavor. It was slightly dry but that is fixed with the addition of one of the four wonderful chimmis. The chimmis are a complete winner here.   THE PLACE:  I was expecting a little hole in the wall joint but that's not what it is anymore since they did a massive redo. It's got a great atmosphere now. It's a super cool place with lots of wood design. Stacks of fire wood along the wall, wood floor, wood tables, and they bring your food out in wooden dishes. Your food is prepared fairly quickly and the service is great and the people are pleasant.   Yes, every aspect of this place is nearly perfect. Everyone from foodies to farmers, hoodlums to hipsters (guess not much different there) will be impressed. There's no way you Couldn't like it. I now can understand why it's got such rave reviews.",

Everything was so good, especially my steak burger. That was a GREAT burger! Downsides - it was a little bit intimidating for an introvert like myself. You walk in, stand in line and order and pay for your food right away. Then you find a table yourself and your food is brought to you by some waiter coming into the dining room and yelling your name. I didn't like this. I want to be seated, have a waiter and a menu. But that's just my personal preference. I'll go back for the food.",

My co-worker said this is his favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh so I had high expectations.  We had to wait outside because if was very crowded for the lunch hour.  I thought this was a good sign.  I don't eat red meat and none of the sandwiches appealed to me so I ordered a large side of grilled vegetables, roasted potatoes, and grilled corn on the cob.  The vegetables were black and mushy because they were so overcooked.  They had a good flavor and the optional sauces were tasty, but it was hard to overcome that they were so grossly overdone.  The potatoes were also overcooked and blackened with way too much rosemary seasoning.  I had to brush a lot of the seasoning off of them so they could even be edible.  The corn was the best part of the meal as it was the only thing cooked and seasoned appropriately.  My other co-worker ordered the carne sandwich and was happy with it.  His potatoes were also overdone and over-seasoned.  My vegetarian co-worker ordered the same thing as I did and also commented that the vegetables were overcooked.  I think this place is probably great if you're a meat-lover, but probably not the best choice for vegetarians.  If I go again, I'll give the chicken sandwich a try, but with so many other great options in this area I'm not sure if I'll be back.",

Holy cow (pun not originally intended, but okay, I'll roll with it), this place is amazing!  In the mood for a steak sandwich? Well, what kind? Your choice of flank steak, skirt steak, ribeye, strip or filet? Or how about chicken? Or shrimp? Chorizo your thing? Or possibly the fish of the day? All piled high on a HUGE ciabatta-style bread with your choice of toppings..and sauces. Chimichurri, pimienton, garlic...I can't remember what the other one is. Want some grilled veggies on that? There are too many to list...just ask for what you want, chances are they'll have it.  Going light and want a salad instead? I had the Gaucho salad with the skirt steak, grilled tomatoes, carrot, avocado, asparagus and roasted corn all piled high on fresh, beautiful greens. Or maybe you'd prefer the Argentino with roasted potatoes and portobellos?  Get ready for sides of corn on the cob roasted in the husk over the wood-fired grill. Oh! All the meats and proteins are grilled over wood that you'll see stacked in the back and in the front under some of the counters. That's part of the secret of the flavor!  Desserts, too, are pretty darn special.  Not much seating, but there are a few stool and counters inside and a few tables outside. Get there while the weather is beautiful...come to think of it, it might still be worth it sitting in 32 degree weather in your parka just to savor the flavor of smoky summer-ish goodness!",

Ambience: From the outside, you would not know this place existed.  Tucked away on the far end of the vibrant Strip District, I actually mistook the kitchen entrance as the front door.  Once inside, you find a really tastefully done interior.  Wood finishing is prevalent throughout, covering everything from the the condiment islands to the plates that the meals are served on.  Taken all together, it's a great match for the food that Gaucho serves.  Service: In two words - friendly and attentive.  Despite being an order-at-the-counter establishment, the table bussers appear to double as \"servers\", checking in on us several times after we sat down, doing everything from offering silverware to refilling water.  Great model.  Food: Nothing I've written would have mattered if the food didn't match in quality - and boy did it.  Collectively, our group ordered 3 sandwiches (ribeye, fish, and pork), a side of potatoes, and an empanada.  The potatoes were golden and crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside.  Perfect for dipping into one of their 4 sauces.  (sauce sidebar: try them all, over and over and over.  Each one was delicious in its own right, from a classic chimichurri to a roasted red pepper.  The right dip to bite ratio is 1:1 - just trust me).  Ok, back to the food.  I ordered the fish sandwich, which came with perfectly charred white fish (cod, perhaps?), sweet carmelized onions, and a soft chewy bun.  Great bun to meat ratio, great balance of flavors.  Each sandwich came with the same bun, but slight variants on the meat accompaniments (peppers for the steak, mustard for the pork) - all were delicious.",

    "text": "Opening tip: try mid afternoon!  We arrived around 2:30 on a Friday afternoon. I loved the experience of walking into the space- hardwood floors, brick walls, wrought iron chandeliers, high ceilings, chalk board menu and well-merchandised sauces. There's so much from which to choose that we decided on three menu items, but be prepared to order your drinks first. I had the small flank steak, which was around $12. He had the small ribeye which was $13, I think. We also ordered the small camarones for $10. They ask for your name and then you find a seat. Before you grab your seat, grab silverware. We didn't have a problem finding a place and opted to sit upstairs, which was open and had a variety of tables, some that could accommodate 8-10 (maybe more), so you can easily dine with groups. At each table you will find a napkin dispenser and a fresh flower. Note: you WILL NOT find steak sauce, salt or pepper so don't be that person...  Our steaks were ordered (and arrived) medium and served with ciabatta bread and salata with an amazing balsamic dressing. The ciabatta was hard so I let it soak up some of the chimichurri sauce. The steaks were perfectly prepared and sliced. The presentation on the wooden platters was clean and inviting. We shared a bite of our steaks and we preferred our own. I loved the camarones doused with lemon.   Highly recommend Gaucho to anyone!",

The empanadas are not the traditional ones I'm used to, (I've been to Argentina several times) but they are good. We liked the pork one the best. The rosemary and garlic red-skin potatoes were awesome!  Much more flavor than normal boring potatoes. The steak was  really good, and the bread was crispy and spot on. The sauces were tasty and plentiful too.   I highly recommend this restaurant when in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Padilla Gaucho is a---mazing. saw it listed as a top 100 Yelps actually 17 in PITTSBURGH?? YUP Pittsburgh!!  I grew up in Pitt, and have been back and forth once every few years for about 25 years. I had to try it. I went yesterday 2/27 with my sister, I had an idea where it was, I knew the area very well, beginning of the  strip, old old building,(they are expanding into the next space this spring and have a pation on the opposite side weather permitting)  If you are not going right to it and know its there you would walk by 99 out of 100 times. FIRST THING;  if the braised beef is available do not hesitate, eat this sandwich.  Flavors out of this world. Caramelized onions. Horseradish sauce. You will not eat s better sandwich.  But get there early they do sell out of this one. Ate this sandwich on my third visit because it was sold out the first two times I was there.    I had the Tilapia plate fire grilled 2 nice size portions, with carmelized onions,  greens, asparagus, grilled tomato they have a little sauce bar (4 mason jars) but do your self a favor and try each on your meal / sandwich, they each have solid flavors.   Tilapia was grilled perfectly, which is not easy to do with this very thin white fish. also ordered the Provelleta, sharp provolone on crisp grilled bread, Sister ordered the steak burger well done and it was again made perfectly hanging right on the edge of well and medium. they give you many options for add ons, she had greens and pickled onions and sharp prov. I could not even speak when the food came out it looked amazing and tasted even better. The staff was so friendly and talkative, never felt like we were being rushed or bothering them. George took our order and walked us thru the whole process again never trying to move us along even as the small area was filling up behind us. He was very kind to every single person that came thru.   well folks, the next day, I had to go back this place is addictive, took niece and sister back in today and was greeted with \"two days in a row Bob\" George greeted us, sister (creature of habit) had the steak  burger again but with some different add ons, I went for the Spanish prosciutto, and niece had the picked chicken (pulled) all these have lived up to the billing as this place makes nothing shabby, Spanish prosciutto is a tad less salty than US or Italian, sharp provolone tops it and I added carmelized onions.  Picked chicken was moist and exploding with flavor, we actually cut the sandwiches in 3rds so we could try each one.  EAT HERE!!!!!!   PERIOD!!!!",

The way all the juices squeeze right into the bouncy sandwich, omggggg...  The gentleman forgot to ask me the temperatures of my meat and I totally forgot to tell him.  I soooo didn't want my meat medium or well done.  It's okay though, the flavor was incredible regardless.  Next time...  We ate so fast, I thought my stomach was gonna explode.  All you hear inside is silence.  It is THAT good, ya'll.  Love their vegetable dish drizzled with balsamic redux.  I literally saw my veggies being rubbed with olive oil and going on the grill, I loved that.  Roasted plum tomato was a perfect touch!  Their salad greens were incredibly fresh and well seasoned, something I really appreciate.  Radish and carrots were shaved to order, not pre-shaved and stored in water, thank you for that.  Really.  Oh, and the caramelized onion is definitely the hidden gem.  Last time I had those was like, 100 yrs ago, ugh, love them.  And the 4 special sauces??? Forget about it, man, Jesus Christ.  If you've never been there, I feel sorry for you!!!!  MOVE UR ASS SOLDIER!!!!",

    "text": "OK, with 276 reviews and a solid 5 star rating on Yelp, there is no question the food here is outstanding.  Not because I am saying so, but because 275 other people are saying so.    So I am going to choose to not speak about the delicious morsels we consumed for lunch nor show you photos of those morsels, but rather to express a bit about Anthony, the owner of Gaucho, who was behind the counter taking our order and running the register when we stopped in today.   Go to Gaucho because of Anthony.  It is a rarity to meet someone like him in the restaurant business.  Because the beauty of a great meal is not only about the food, but it is the \"experience\" that comes with that food.    In addition to really having a winning personality and a top notch customer service touch, Anthony has a passion for his menu, his kitchen, his food and his staff.  Although he does not seem like the kind of guy who is ever going to flash his culinary credentials, after prodding it out of him a bit, clearly he has a great pedigree in the business and it is to Pittsburgh's great fortune that he has chosen to share the culmination of this experience and his craft here in the Strip District.  He was sincerely welcoming, genuinely interested in sharing his knowledge about the food from his kitchen and exuded respect, fun and flair with us and also with his staff.    Go to Gaucho because it is a worthy unique opportunity to taste something special.  More importantly though, go to Gaucho because you want to meet Anthony and support this good guy and his great staff who are really doing something special in the food world.",

Smoky, moist, flavorful, these adjectives sound so creepy used together but it was like a cornucopia of delicious on my place.  I can't believe I haven't been here sooner.  I declared that from now on, I only eat at Gaucho but then my bank account was like, \"LOL, no.\"  This place isn't cheap but who wants discount meat?

However, we went last week with friends. I know the waits get long here but it was early evening and we thought we'd be safe. From line to food, it was probably 35-40 minutes. Kudos to these guys for having a devoted following! However there isn't enough room to accommodate the folks waiting; it's cramped and in front of the door which blocks thru traffic. I loved that they offer Mexican coke- something I treat myself to every time I see it! Meal wise: we were all obsessed with the toast. Man, is that good! Between the four of us we got a huge chunk of the menu- the sides are definitely a strength here! The potatoes, bread, grits-- all really good. My steak was unfortunately stringy and the small platter it was all served on was pretty small for the amount of food on there. The service was thoughtful and kind. Tbh, this probably would've been a four if some of the details (waits and serveware) were a little more thought out. I would definitely go back but in a more obscure hour, for sure.",

The smells in this place are fantastic and really increased the anticipation.

Here's what to get:  Argentina small salad ($8) and add steak ($5) for the best of it all.  I got a beef empanadas ($3) added too and it was delicious.  Sixteen dollars for an amazing meal!

The place was busy the food was good but the price was a little steep comparative to other like places I have visited considering what I purchased.

It took us 85 minutes to get to the counter to order our food. Long wait, but well worth it.  We ordered an Asado plate which includes all five cuts of their steaks for $50. We also ordered two empanadas, pork and chicken as well as roasted cauliflower and potatoes as sides. Not that we needed it, but just because of reviews and pictures, we ordered a steak burger sandwich, a small provoleta, and flans for dessert.  Steak burger was the best! Asado was great. Flan was very good. Roasted cauliflower was also good. The rest not as much.  Prices are reasonable. Their system of ordering and paying at the counter first is interesting and efficient. All staff and servers were friendly, helpful and efficient. Sauces were good but not really needed - steaks are good on their own.  All in all, it was a nice experience, and we will stop by the next time we are in Pittsburgh for sure.  And, remember that line at 6pm? It was still there at 9pm when we were leaving ... not the same people but equally enthusiastic!",

The meat was cooked to perfection, with a rich flavorful grilled taste! The house salsas (sauces) are a must have item to try when you go visit this adorable restaurant!   The staff is friendly, the interior is clean, and the food is amazing! I don't think there is more I could right to not want to make you go eat here.   Definitely will come back during my next visit to Pittsburgh",

We showed up a little after 3 o clock on a Saturday and the line was out the door, we briefly considered going somewhere else but sucked it up and waited.  You order and pay at the counter then they take you to your seat and a porter brings your food.  There are not a lot of vegetarian mains on the menu, just a veggie sandwich, but tons of veggie sides.  So i did what any insane person would do and ordered all the veggie sides and a side of toast.  They were all amazing.  Potatoes are always great, carrots with honey and goat cheese - amazing, mushrooms - fantastic.  Will definitely go back and gladly wait in line again!!!",

The vegetables were soft and yummy, and the grits were just perfect. They were perfectly seasoned and didn't have too much butter.   Overall, it was honestly one of the best I've ever had.   I also got the spicy chorizo small plate, which came with toast and caramelized/grilled onions and red peppers. It was so flavorful and had enough spice. Just get a good bite of bread with the chorizo and red peppers and you're good to go.   I absolutely loved all of the chimichuri sauces. All 4 are flavorful and compliments the foods we got. I really liked the green one and the red one.   If I need to come back to Pittsburgh again, I will definitely be coming back to try some of their other menu items.",

The steak was cooked to perfection, the shrimp were the best I've ever had - grilled and seasoned wonderfully. They offer three homemade sauces you can help yourself to.

    "text": "Simply outstanding food. I'm now going to out myself as one of those avid Yelp users who has relied on Yelp 100 times (literally), all throughout the country, and recommends the app to everyone ... and yet I've never written a review. Today, I was inspired to do so by a phenomenal meal at Gaucho Parrilla Argentina.  I can't remember previously seeing a full 5-star review on Yelp with 50+ reviews. This restaurant deserves that status. My son and I had two steak sandwiches (one ribeye, one NY Strip) and both were absolutely delicious -- perfect bread, excellent steak, killer sauces, and a just-right balance of onion, pepper, and seasoning. Really, hard to make a sandwich much better. Sides were also absolutely top notch:  shrimp, corn, and papas. Each were legitimately world-class. If it sounds like I'm exaggerating, I'm not. My wife is a classically-trained French chef and we're fortunate enough to have really high quality food pretty much every day. We've eaten at terrific restaurants all over the country (and beyond).  This place merits a five-star review.   I'll also say that from a service perspective, every person we interacted with there was kind, knowledgeable, and willing to talk about the history behind the place.  They went above and beyond.   A few caveats, just to manage expectations. First, BYOB. No corkage fee, but no alcohol there. Also, the place is charming but teeny -- it probably seats less than eight people on counters and stools. If anything, this is more of a takeout place; definitely not white-table cloth. Effectively, we're talking 28+ on food, albeit with a limited menu, but a 14 on decor. Finally, be aware that Gaucho Parrilla Argentina closes at 7 PM and is closed on Sunday and Monday.   So, if you understand the limitations of the place beforehand, make sure you come. You'll walk out saying that it was some of the best food you've ever eaten. While I'm from Pittsburgh originally, I live in Boston and in town for the Steeler game. I'll certainly be back at Gaucho the next time I'm in the Burgh. A classic Yelp gem.",

    "text": "This little hole in the wall in the Strip is serving up some yummy grilled food. The first time we tried to go here they were out of chicken, and I don't usually eat beef, so we went elsewhere. I thought about docking them a star for this, as actually having the food that's being offered on the menu is a big part of running a successful restaurant, but, after having eaten here, I think the place is 4 star worthy.   There is no table service here, and really no tables other than the ones on the patio outside. There are a few barstools inside, but the comfort level is low, as you have people milling about, either standing in line or waiting for their to go orders, and the space underneath the stools where your legs and feet would normally go is taken up by stacked wood. As a side note I'll say that it's too bad there's no place in the Strip, such as a small park or some other public area, where people can go and congregate...it would be a nice addition to the neighborhood, and there are a couple of take out places that could benefit. The outside tables were all taken when we arrived, so we ate at the counter on the barstools. We ordered the chicken from the \"hambre\" side of the menu, and sides of the grilled veggies and gaucho potatoes. This was a good amount of food for the two of us. The chicken comes \"picked\" and served with their onion sauce, a delicious concoction of caramelized onions that have been pureed and seasoned. The veggies were grilled perfectly, and the potatoes were delicious. We helped ourselves to the sauces they offer...a roaster red pepper sauce, a garlicky ajo and their version of chimichurri, that Argentinian staple. All were very good. They really know how to cook here, and the food is delicious. I hope they become successful enough to afford a move to roomier digs at some point in the future. In the meantime, I'll still go and hope for an empty barstool.",

They recently expanded into a bigger area, but I haven't been there since. It's actually challenging for me to eat here, because there are so many delicious options. To top off each selection, they provide different sauces (my favorite is the chimichuri) that you can choose from to compliment your sandwich. However, I have found that the sandwiches are bursting with so much flavor do not even need the sauces! There is nothing like going to the strip Saturday morning and walking into gaucho for an early lunch... I've never been to Argentina, but smelling the aroma of the meats and just the friendly atmosphere that the employees create, makes me feel like I've walked off of Penn Ave and right into another country. A winner for me is the filet mingnon sandwich with roasted red peppers, caramelized onions on fresh, homemade ciabatta bread. Trust me, you can't go wrong. Stop in and treat yo'self!",

If it's your first time, the front of house experience is a bit awkward. It's not bad, it's just weird. You order at the counter as a group, but can split your check. After that, you can order more from your table and get table service. Tip well and be loved. The entire staff splits tips. I wish they'd just raise prices and wages, but we're just not there yet as a nation. One thing at a time.  Look at the menu ahead of time and know what you want. For the love of god: don't keep Pittsburgh waiting outside for Gaucho because you were live tweeting the wait instead of thinking about what you wanted to eat, you heathen. Or Snapchatting. You were snapping, weren't you. On that note, this place is small. Please be considerate of those in line once you recover from the meat sweats.   Open the wine. You can't go wrong here, but get the flank steak and carrots. The flank steak is impressive but the carrots are a spiritual experience. You can eat the large, but get the small because bread pudding. Get rare to medium or you're dead to me. Try all the sauces but you only need ajo (garlic sauce) for your toast. Finish the wine or give the rest to a table in need.   Walk down to Leaf & Bean, open the whiskey, and revel in the privilege of a cool summer's eve in the city o' ahrn. If you don't know what you like, get a Leaf by Oscar with the Connecticut wrapper. Enjoy, but do not finish the whiskey. Get home safe.",

Steak and chimi chiri was excellent, pepper and onion were the best! Only thing was not impressed with were the empenada, had steak and chicken kinda dry. Veggies were awsome. Will definitely go back. Staff was great as well!",

    "text": "This was probably the best meal I have had in Pittsburgh and I cannot say enough good things about this place. I got the steak burger with avocado and pickled onions and it was cooked to perfection. And the toasted bread that it was served on was also fresh and delicious. The burger was so flavorful on its own, though they do offer a nice array of sauces to add more flavor. They have 4 sauces that you can try as much as you want of, and each sauce is tailored to a specific kind of meat, though you can combine how ever you want. I liked all of them, but the one that was meant for the red meats was my favorite.  The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. They have a system where you order as a whole group up at the register, you sit at a table, and then you will get all of your food at the same time. I personally like this system better than the typical waiting for the check system.  My friend and I got there at about 5:30 on a Thursday, and we got there just as crowds stared to pour in. This place gets super crowded, so I would recommend getting there before 5:30 on Thursdays-Saturdays at least.  Overall, one of the best meals I've ever had and definitely the best in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Truly enjoyed my experience tonight! My pro-tip would be to come on a week night and early (5:30ish if you can) as there isn't ever a wait. Because there was no line, my wife and I had like five minutes to drool over the menu on the wall before going up to the counter and spending the next five minutes working with the ultra friendly and helpful staff to get their recommendations. (Let it be known that I always look for recommendations on Yelp, but when everybody loves everything on here, it's hard to whittle it down.)   Per the staff's recommendations we got the sirloin sandwich medium rare and the chory pan sandwich. Additionally, we decided to get two empanadas and a alfajore cookie.   The meat was cooked expertly and the empanadas were surprisingly good. I don't care for goat cheese but the pork and cheese empanada was actually my favorite! The alfajore cookie tasted kind of like a shortbread cookie with caramel and coconut which wasn't my fave, but we came here to celebrate my wife and she can have whatever she wants :)   Will definitely be back on a week night at 5:30 for more",

My friend used this place to cater her wedding, so with that kind of recommendation I knew I had to check it out. There's street and lot parking nearby. BYOB but also keep in mind that a lot of liquor stores nearby close by 7 pm. Be prepared to wait in line (which is 10000% worth it!)  I split the Asado Platter with another person which was honestly the best case scenario. We loved being able to sample all the types of steak and taste the difference between all of them. Out of the five, the loma was my favorite but I would get all of them again just for the experience. Make sure to get all the self serve sauces as well! I would also highly recommend the bread pudding! Such a nice way to end a meal.",

I had about four to employees invoked in between ordering, serving, and clearing my table. They were all nice so while confusing still five stars.   I ordered the sandwich. Too much bread .. but other than that delicious. So my tip just order the meat. Forget the sandwich. Delicious but what you really want is the meat.  This place is one of those amazingly good restaurants with some stupid quirks.   Oh and Jesus... Great bathrooms. Literally smelled fresher in the bathroom than outside.",

    "text": "I love steak and Gaucho is a great place for it! We shared the Asado Platter, 6 pieces of Empanadas, and the Veggie Plate between 4 of us. This was the perfect amount and we were all decently full after the meal despite getting HUNGRY from the wait. We came at around 1pm on a Friday and had to wait about 30 minutes before we could put in our order and be seated.  The steak was very flavorful and came perfectly medium rare as we had requested. If anything, some of the pieces were more on the raw side, which I didn't mind but some people might. I loved that I was able to try all the different cuts, and since all 4 of us had different favorites, I was able to get a few pieces of my favorite cuts.  The empanadas weren't bursting with flavor but they were tasty in a homey way, especially the pastry part! For $11, I expected the Veggie Plate to be a bit bigger, but the vegetables were delicious. My friend who normally dislikes veggies became a veggie monster!  Gaucho is a good place to have a bit of good steak for a decent price and still have enough left in your budget to get a little bit of something else. I can see myself coming back next time I'm in the area!",

Gaucho is BYOB so if that's your thing,  bring a bottle or two.  The food was spectacular! We tried the beef empanadas,  rosemary beef sandwich,  artic char sandwich,  veggie platter and carrots roasted in honey with brie cheese.

    "text": "The girlfriend and I have been wanting to go to Gaucho as soon as we found out about it from Yelp. We actually did try to go one time but as we pulled up the line was out the door and around the corner. We stood in line with some friends for about 10 minutes before we realized the line wasn't budging. Granted, we didn't stay in line that long, but we were very hungry and restaurant week was currently happening so we decided to go elsewhere. We recently went back and figure out why there is so much hype about Gaucho!  The first tip I would give to you would be to be prepared to wait in line depending on the day/time you go and the second tip would be to bring alcohol because it is BYOB! The second time we went we waited for about 20 minutes before being seated. The staff was very helpful and made sure everyone knew the wait times, they even told us that they were stopping taking orders since there were no tables to seat customers at the time. The way the restaurant works is very interesting, you decide what you want on the way to the cashier (gives you something to do while your waiting as well) and then you order and get shown to your seat by a host.   We ended up ordering the some empanadas, cheesy bread, a chicken sandwich, and pulled pork sandwich. The food came out super quickly which was great because we were very hungry. They also offer a number of sauces which we tried in line and fell in love with the red pepper sauce. The empanadas were wonderful and tasted authentic and fresh as well as the cheesy bread which was surprisingly better than it sounded on the menu board. The sandwiches were huge and we ended up having to take them home but they were also amazing and stuffed with meats.   I am looking forward to going back here and trying out the other wonderful things the menu had to offer!",

My only complaint is that parking is difficult here there is not a parking lot and sometimes if you're lucky- there will be street parking nearby.   The customer service is great here! Everyone is always so smiley and accommodating. I also appreciate the order first then wait for your food process at Gaucho. It's very efficient and helps with the almost always long line here.",

And both times it was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I like the variety of dipping sauces. I'd recommend that you go with the beef cut that you like (I personally like Ribeye). Others in my party ordered salads and added steak to it, they looked really good. I will need to go that route next time.  We also ordered the empanadas, I liked the veggie and the beef.",

    "text": "Full marks for food and service, less half a star for the wait time - even though the food was more worth it.  I couldn't tell you how we got to Gaucho Parrilla, or where it is, but I can tell you from the moment I began researching places to eat for our Pittsburgh trip there was no place I wanted to be more. At first looking at the level of the care and quality used to make the food in the pictures and the name, I expected this place to be uber fancy and pricey - not so. GPA is a little more than a takeaway joint just with seating (not enough mind you... but seating nonetheless).  You basically should prepare yourself for a 30-45 min + wait time, not inside... outside. You brave that and you've essentially earned the right to dine here. We braved it, despite grumbling tummies and hangry door blocking to ensure no one got in ahead of us or skipped line.  We went a bit crazy for our order but shared everything so we could try as many things as possible. In no particular order:  Pork empanadas - more batter than meat, well cooked and flavourful but not super memorable tbh  Spicy Chorizo - the fire roasted bread and peppers served make my mouth water all on their own but that chorizo was a spicy little gift. Could have just eaten 3-4 of these and been totally content.  Rosemary Beef sandwich - HOLYYEEEEEE. So big, so juicy, so. much. beef. It was so good I wanted to press my face in between the buns and motorboat that meat - judge me if you must but eat here first and then come back to me. Easily top 5 sandwiches of my life.  Large Ribeye - and as if I wasn't already praising glory be to the Argentinian meat gods on high after the sandwich, they go ahead and perfectly cook, slice and season a glorious ribeye steak and smother it with sauce - EF. ME. UP right here. I'd stab someone if they got in the way of me eating this.. So succulent, dripping with fatty flavours and cooked perfectly.  All in this is definitely no veggie-vegan friendly but carnivores beware this is your happy place - it sure was mine. First stop when I'm back in town for a Steelers game next year is GPA!

Facts:  Four types of chimichurries  Steaks and steak sandwiches At least one type of fish on menu 4-6 sides ranging from beans and greens to potatoes to eggplant to mushrooms Homemade empanadas (slightly overrated)  Drinks are BYOB, wish they served glasses of house wine  Lines anywhere from 15mins - 2hrs  Staff is nice and pretty attentive.   Recommendations: make it easier to get back in line for ordering dessert/drink/etc and serve house wine by glass, BYOB is much appreciated but not everyone plans ahead, plus you would make a lot more money.",

When you walk in the, the staff is extremely friendly and give their advice on what to order. I went hungry and left extremely full with left overs. We ordered a side of potatoes because the empanada maker was sadly out of order and this was enough for both of us to share. I ordered the rosemary braised beef with caramelized onions and horseradish sauce and it came on a nice soft roll. I will say that I wish that there was a little more horseradish but I just know for next time what to ask for. My husband ordered the rib eye with peppers, onions and chimmi churri sauce on a hard roll and he loved it.   If you're looking to go as a group or to sit down, just note that there are bar stools and small counters inside. They do have outdoor seating but depending on the weather, you may just want to take your food to go or back to your office.  Thoroughly impressed and would highly recommend. The smells alone will get you to walk in =)",

It's a small place (it can hold 10-12 people max), and it's easy to miss if you're walking by.  The first thing you notice when you walk in is the aroma from the grill; your mouth is already watering before you sit down. I ordered the carne sandwich with ribeye, which comes topped with grilled peppers & onions and chimmichurri sauce. The meat was well seasoned and cooked perfectly - juicy and tender, with a really nice char. I washed it down with a cold Mexican Coke. It's not the cheapest sandwich you'll find, ringing in at $12, but it's more than worth it. I came in hungry and left full.  Besides the food itself, what really made my visit great was the excellent service. The owner of the place was super friendly and very patient, explaining the various items on the menu. They also did all the little things that take customer service from just good to exceptional. For example, one customer walked in and placed a $150 order to go. Gaucho gives a 10% discount if you call ahead with your takeout order (pro tip), but they went ahead gave him the discount anyway and helped him walk his  order out to his car in the snowy conditions. That is how you do customer service.",

All the taste of a high end steak house for half the cost and none of the pretentiousness.  Dine in a relaxed atmosphere with brick walls, hardwood floors, and exposed heat pipes and abundant natural lighting.  Did I mention BYOB with no cork charge?  If you forget, the friendly staff will tell you where you can buy drinks near by.  This place is ranked #7 in the Yelp Top 100 in the Country.  Its not a fluke. Click your Bookmark button.

    "text": "Gaucho is pretty good. Having gone a handful of times, I can't say it's line-out-the-door good, but it's definitely worth checking out.  I've almost always ordered the Parrilloda Mixta in order to try a bunch of meats, but every time I kind of regret my decision, mainly because of the how tough the NY Strip is to get through. The chicken is good, but doesn't have too much flavor, so you'll be using their sauces to get through it (their sauces are excellent!). If you're going with the red meat, I'd definitely recommend the flank or lomo. They always seem to come out cooked to perfection. They season their meats with salt (traditional Argentine technique), so expect a sodium overload on flavor, and if you don't like salty, you probably won't like a lot of their food.  The sides are hit-or-miss for me. The empanadas are okay, but they've been pretty dry whenever I've tried them. My favorite side is the Guacho Papas. I could eat these all day. Perfectly roasted potatoes! The humita is also phenomenal. I'd definitely recommend the papas and humita if you're on the fence when ordering. I've never had either of those let me down!  Ultimately, where Gaucho succeeds is their great, personable staff, fast service, and mostly better-than-average food. Also their newer, expanded space is beautiful! Gaucho's struggles rest with inconsistent meat preparation (especially the oft-overcooked, tough strip), being too salty for the salt-averse customer, long lines on the weekends, and price (don't expect to leave Gaucho will a cheap bill). If you can get there in off-hours (right after work, for example), the wait will be short and you can be in and out quickly, but I wouldn't put Gaucho in the must-eat category that's necessary to justify standing in a line that wraps around the building. It's good, but it's never been THAT good. Enjoy!",

    "text": "This is the story of a girl.  A girl with a dream.  A dream about steak.  A week before I had a random Wednesday-Thursday off, I decided that Thursday would be it.  The day I finally made my way to Gaucho.  Of course I've heard the hype.  Who in the Pittsburgh Yelpiverse hasn't?  Clearly at this point Gaucho is well established.  I didn't expect to be disappointed.  The question was just how happy could a lunch at Gaucho make me?  I knew I had to do my research.  I drooled over the menu several times ahead of time trying to narrow down the choices so I wouldn't panic when I ordered.  I read several of the hundreds of Yelp reviews looking to learn the ins and outs of how to order (at the counter, take a seat and wait for your name to be called), when to arrive (since it seems to always be busy, often with a line out the door), how the service was (friendly) and what people thought of the food itself (amazing).    The night before I had attended a Yelp Elite event at a local brewery.  I hit up three local breweries that day (it's kind of my thing) and came home with an IPA that I thought would pair well with the steak I was anticipating.  And then the waiting....  I planned to arrive at Gaucho when they first opened at 11am.  I scored rock star parking just in front of their location.  I got out of my car and could immediately smell that wood fired grill. The outside patio was intriguing but it was a little muggy so I decided on dining inside.  I went to the corner entry door (don't be fooled by the two other doors that are not entrances for patrons) and made my way inside.  The inside is welcoming and the huge menu greets you as you approach the counter to place your order.  I was the first to arrive, but only long enough to place my order and pick my seat.  I kindly told the first girl who asked me if I wanted a drink that all I needed was a glass since I brought my own beer.  She happily obliged and the girl next to her took my order.  I went with the small skirt steak plate, medium.  I took my seat in a corner table so I could watch the magic behind the scenes.  I watched the efficient symphony of servers emerging from the kitchen, dancing through the dining room calling out names to deliver food to anticipating diners and clearing tables for incoming patrons while another employee transferred wood from the dining area to the grill in order to keep the fire going.    My meal was delivered to me within 15 minutes and it was such a thing of beauty that it brought a tear to my eye.  I almost didn't want to eat this work of art.  Gaucho is simple but captivating with its presentation, in this case my medium skirt steak with chimmi, toast and salad.  I took my time to savor every bite and every angle.  I tried the 4 different sauces they had on the counter as well and liked them all, but found the meat did not need any extras.  Good steak like this stands on its own.    It might seem questionable as to why I only gave 4 stars.  The overall experience of Gaucho is definitely not to be missed, don't get me wrong.  But I think I would have been confused about how and what to order if I hadn't prepared myself ahead of time.  I also think that despite the efficiency in service it can be disruptive when names are yelled out through the whole restaurant.  I guess what this really means is I'll have to go back again and try something else to see if I can have an even better experience.  Sigh.  If I must.",

    "text": "Made it back and was so happy I did. If you are looking for the entrance it is easy to spot. Just look for the line of people curling around the on ramp to the 16th St Bridge.  My only problem was parking. I managed to snag a spot but the meter wouldn't take my credit  card and I had just enough quarters for a little over an hour. I hurried over and got in line. They had a new girl who was polling the lines to answer any questions I had concerning the menu. I asked her for the fastest options since I was contemplating having to take my sandwich and run. She suggested the braised beef or the pollo(chicken) sandwich, or the pulled pork.  Since I had my mind set on the braised beef with caramelized onions and horseradish that would be an easy choice. I really couldn't see much of the restaurant except that I noticed it did have outdoor seating as well as table and high top seating. I waited approx 30 minutes to order my sandwich and then asked how long would it take. They told me just 2 minutes and they gave me change in quarters to run out and \"feed the meter\" while they prepared it.  I ran out and back and found that my sandwich was ready and waiting for me! I decided to order the Argentine cookies as a small dessert since I knew that bread was thick. It was almost like eating a sandwich from a NY deli. The beef was just right with the toppings added on it. They did have an area where you could add different sauces to your sandwich. If you want additional toppings then you would need to add $.50 according to the chalkboard menu.  While i was enjoying my sandwich the manage came around and addressed me by name and asked how I was liking my meal. I replied \"very good\" and asked him about my recent visit during the renovations. He explained to me that during that time they were expanding and with the line completely out the door I could see why.  They had apologized that they did not have the chocolate or coffee cookies but I was happy with the shortbread ones. They were macaroon filled cookies and they had coconut on them. It was just enough and very good to finish off my meal. Staff is very friendly and helpful.  I was able to make it back to my car with time to spare and head on my way. My advice is to allow at least 2 hours if you are visiting this place since it would have normally taken (I was told) 15-20 minutes. Take out is available but the wait time is just the same. If you are planning to visit it along with shopping in the strip district then I would suggest a parking lot or garage.",

Like sauces are self-serve and they have to-go bags to grab so you don't have to wait for the waitstaff to get your cheque/to-go boxes!  Food: Asado Platter - ribeye was the winner for me. To be honest, I didn't care too much for other cuts. But my friends each liked different cuts so it worked out :) Ribeye is the fattiest. Flank was leanest. Skirt was thick-cut and juicy. Ny strip was somewhere in the middle in terms of fatty and lean. The fifth cut whose name I cannot remember was also very lean and most meaty/gamey imo. Good for sharing! The only caveat is that their medium rare was more like rare...idk if you like that, great. But wasn't fan of how tough the raw center was to chew.  Shrimps on skewers are off-the-menu item that are also great - grilled and herbed.   Sides: good portion for the price. Beef Empanadas were great! Sweet potato with caraway seeds and sunflower seeds were the group's least liked. We wish we got something else instead.   Desserts: dulce de leche shortbread cookies were so good! Could eat that every meal. Shortbread is very soft and dulce de leche isn't too sweet. And the whole cookie is coated with toasted coconut shreds!   Sauces: prob the second best thing after steak. 4 different kinds. All delish. Kinda wish they served tortilla chips so I can dip them in.",

I can only imagine how busy it is during prime lunch and dinner hours.  The atmosphere is pretty hip and casual, and the restaurant looks newly renovated.   We were in a rush so we opted for sandwiches (ribeye and rosemary braised beef). These are now my favorite sandwiches without any exaggeration. Since they make their meat to order expect to wait around 15 minutes for takeout, but it is certainly worth it.  They do their sandwiches extremely well - from the bun through the meat - everything is perfectly thought out.  Probably now my favorite food place in Pittsburgh.",

Just order a lot of small plates and start sharing.  After you sit you can very quickly order more of what you love !! Try as many dishes as possible.  The entrees were nice but when we got back it will be ordering in this style.  Trying is key !!  We had the best experience",

I got the carne sandwich and my boyfriend got the lamb chops...both done perfectly with just the right amount of pink. The sauces help to make the meal, try all 4...you really can't go wrong!! Service was also extremely friendly, attentive and always ready to answer your questions and help you in any way possible. The only downside (and the reason it didn't get 5 stars) was the wait. I spent a total of 2 hours there, most of them which was waiting for the cold, but that isn't really their fault..and it's obvious that the food is just so good that everyone is willing to wait. I cannot wait to go back but preferably not on a Saturday night this time so I don't have to wait 500 years",

    "text": "This review isn't about the food, which is mostly excellent based on the two times that I've been previously. I tried to go tonight for takeout and was told that I would have to wait in the long line for people actually sitting at the restaurant to order my food because I hadn't called ahead. It's beyond preposterous to make people wait all that time simply to order takeout. I've never heard of this happening at other restaurants. On top of that the employee was brusque and even a little bit rude. I understand that places like this restaurant are really popular and as a result the staff often get overworked, but this policy doesn't make any sense. If you're going to prevent walk up customers from ordering takeout at the restaurant itself in a timely manner, then you shouldn't offer takeout any longer. And if your staff are overworked and having to stay late every night (as other posters have mentioned), maybe you should adjust the closing time accordingly.",

The smoked taste of the meat combined with the sweetness of the caramelized onion and the roasted red pepper was a perfect blend. The chewy bread adds a nice texture too. I added a side of horseradish for a nice kick. The owner was working and was so friendly to everyone. Overall this was a great experience and I can not wait to return. Give this place a try and you too will see that it deserves the hype.",

We didn't get there until after six, so we waited a while in the line outside, but the food was definitely worth the wait, even considering the cold.  The restaurant is BYOB so come prepared with your favorite cerveza.  We ordered the Parrilloda Mixta, the Provoletta and the Gaucho Papas.  I promise you everything was exceedingly delicious.  We ordered the steak medium rare and it was cooked perfectly.  The chorizo was perhaps the best I've ever had and the chicken was well seasoned and tasty.  Once we ordered, we did not wait long for our food.  You order at the counter, collect your plates and sauces and then find a seat.  I think we probably waited 10-12 minutes for the food.  I must say it's a shame they're closed on Sunday, because as I write this review, I want more Gauchos!  Also, they have some really original Pittsburgh art on the walls that is for sale- just an extra touch I thought added to the overall appeal.  Great pick John.",

The day I went it was very hot outside.  And at around 2 pm there were 2 people in there waiting until I showed up then the small store front got packed and even hotter when they fired up that wood grill.   The man who took my order was very friendly. The sandwiches were delicious.  I got the filet sandwich and the chicken and can honestly say these were the best sandwiches we have had in a long time.  I tried most of the sauces and they were very flavorful.  I dropped the sandwich halves to my friend who was working and he texted me to say \"how much he loved them and how good the sauces were\"!  This place is a must try! I can't wait to try more of their items.",

This is my first stop as soon as I get into the city. And it almost made me move there. The smell as soon as you get within a block is incredible. The firewood stacked along all the walls scream of authenticity, and the people who work there are so cool. I'm a fan of the steak burger, and its been consistently good. Last time I had it with some bacon, and the bacon was way overcooked to the point of being charcoal. I would say to stick to veggie toppings on the burger, but it wasn't egregous enough for me to knock off a star, and I'm sure that if I had said something they would have fixed it immediately. A word of caution, it does get hot inside. Great for the winter, not as fun in the summer.",

Third, the service is terrible and five minutes after we were finished eating we were asked to leave so they could use the table.  The place is super small but they are supposed to have a private banquet facility downstairs. Why not open that up to seating so your not kicking you customers out. $125 for dinner and we were promptly kicked out. Don't go, this place isn't worth it at all!!!",

The caramelized onions were sweet and savory. The chimichurri added a nice bitter taste. And the bread absorbed all the juices and allowed all of the different flavors to stand out in unison.  This was one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. It's undoubtedly the best sandwich I've had in Pittsburgh. I'm not even sure we should refer to it as a sandwich considering how transcendental it is.",

The first time, I got the steak sandwich- the meat was cooked perfectly and the bread is perfectly crusty yet soft on the inside. Tonight I got the fish sandwich, and I can honestly say it was the best sandwich I have ever had. The fish of the day (I believe it was walleye) was flaky and seasoned nicely, and went perfectly with all the flavorful sauces. Also, the potatoes are delicious as well. YUM!",

    "text": "I finally got a chance to try Gaucho Parrilla Argentina. I'd heard the buzz and I really wanted to check it out. I am pleased to say that all the reports I'd heard are correct.  This. Is. Good. Food.  For what it's worth, I went on Tuesday night.  I'd tried to go before, but the lines can be VERY long on certain evenings, especially weekends.  So long, in fact, that it is possible the last person in line will be holding a sign stating something to the effect that once s/he orders no more orders will be taken.  So go on an off night, or early.  If you go on the weekend plan to wait in line.  It's BYOB, so bring good beer or red wine.  For my first excursion two of us ate, and we were able to share a few of the apps and entrees. I can now vouch for the fact that the chicken empanadas are tasty morsels baked into a delicious pastry shell. I can also vouch that the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich is quite tasty, although the one I tried was ever-so-slightly too dry. That was easily fixed by dipping it into any one of the tasty house-made sauces you can get at Gaucho.  However, the winner was the Bondiola sandwich. Perfectly roasted and juicy pork, with spicy mustard and caramelized onion on ciabatta. This sandwich was absolutely a \"WOW!\" My fellow partner and I both declared the Bondiola to be the best sandwich we'd tasted in quite some time.  We will be going back, and while I love to try new things each time I visit a restaurant I'm going to be hard-pressed not to order the Bondiola again.  For dessert they also served a lemon pound-cake. It was the perfect ending to an excellent meal although I can't vouch for whether this is a standard item or whether it was special that night. I therefore have to suggest that if it is available, get it.  Overall the restaurant is comfortable, the menu is fantastic (albeit daunting in actual size as well as content), and the food was excellent. Gaucho Parrilla Argentina does it right!",

    "text": "Gaucho.  Who doesn't love to say Gaucho?  And what meat eaters wouldn't love this tiny little spot in the Strip?  We arrived early on a Saturday morning.  And Chef Anthony Falcon was already performing for the crowd!  Yes, this man is a performer, describing the menu, giving tips on what to order and truly thrilling the crowd!  So, here is a bit of the condensed version of the story of this grill spot.  A gaucho is an Argentina cowboy.  These gauchos would grill beef over a wood fire, giving the meat an incredible flavor.  Chef Anthony's great grandfather was a gaucho in Argentina.  Be sure to search the restaurant wall for a photo of him dressed in gaucho garb.  Well, on to the story.  Chef Anthony's uncle visited Pittsburgh from Argentina and said, you have got to put a restaurant in the Strip.  And so, here we are today.    It's interesting to enter and see stacks of natural hardwood everywhere.  All cooking it done by fire.  No oven.  No stove.  And definitely no microwave.  It's almost prehistoric.  Wood, fire, meat.  The day we visited, Chef Anthony was not cooking, he was entertaining and waiting on the crowd.  Not being super hungry, we opted to order simple items.  I got a cob of corn and steak empanadas.  OMG.  Can't say enough about the awesome flavors here.  BJ got a chorizo sandwich with peppers, onion & pimenton.  So good.  Also, I added the pimenton to my empanadas.  Spectacular.    Clearly, we need to return with an appetite.  And try more of the menu.  Can't wait for that!",

Waited in line for 20 minutes outside and an additional 15 minutes inside, the food was slow to come out. All of this usually would result in two to three stars. But the food was amazing and well worth the wait. I had the pork it was out of this world I ordered the small portion and it was more than enough I left full. The flank steak was also very good, as were the beef and pork empanadas. They also give you side of toast with your meal which is great dipped in their sauces.",

Once inside, the two of us ordered a selection of things including the Zanahoria bebe (baby carrots), chorizos, provoletta, and the qui qui chicky.  The qui qui chicky is amazing, I literally had a dream about it.  The provoletta was also delicious.  I don't remember for certain, but I think our total came to under $40 including tip.

On a busy Friday evening we waited in line a half hour and my wife ordered the flank steak and I ordered the ribeye.  We also ordered the clam, mussel and squid appetizer.  Both steaks came out barely warm, almost cold and the appetizer was scalding hot, way too hot to eat clams or mussels.  The taste wasn't bad but it was hard to judge because of the missed temperatures.  Another uneasy moment happened in the kitchen which is easily visible when ordering your food.  One of the chefs exited the cooler with a tray of the salad that is served with many of the meals.  There was another tray of raw foods in a dirty container laid on top of the greens.  He shouted out \"who did this?!\" And the entire staff started pointing fingers at one another.  That should have been our cue to leave.  Kitchen cleanliness is no laughing matter.  I would bet our bad experience was due to how busy they were but it will be our first and last visit.",

The braised beef with horseradish is a must try and any of the salads with any of the steaks (i love the flank).  BUT they do have lots of delicious of sauces if you need something to perfectly compliment your dishes (see photos)    New on the menu are the scallops, which I love more than anything they serve, especially the fresh grapefruit mixed in with the seafood dish.   I could go on but essentially anything I've ordered at this place has been phenomenal. And they now have outdoor seating as opposed to just the small space available inside.",

    "text": "I was blown away by the entire early dinner experience Husband and I had here last night.  Always nice when expectations and hype are met!  Allow me to add to Gaucho Parrilla Argentina's accolades...  We ordered the Asado Plate, which is a grilled heap of all 5 of Gaucho's available cuts of beef.  Our decision to order this dish was a fantastic one.  Sure, I've experienced each of these meats before, but it was really cool to have all the grilled meats labeled side by side and compare them visually as well as by taste.  A nice surprise was that the portion was bigger than I expected.  I anticipated I'd love the filet, which I did, and was surprised by how delicious the skirt was--a nice amount of fat and very tender.  The other cuts--NY, flank, and ribeye--were all nicely executed and good, but the filet and skirt stood out to me.  Also ordered the large portion of Vegetales, which is essentially a beautiful plate of mixed grilled veggies.  I thought some of the vegetables tasted kind of plain, but then something dawned on me.  Read on.  Gaucho's condiments are what really take this place to the next level.  The 4 complimentary condiments--chimmi churri, pimenton, ajo, and cebolla--can be dished up fresh from jars in the ordering area, or you can purchase 8oz. for $5.  The condiments are killer and really give the already-yummy food some oomph, and I liked that none of the condiments are spicy.  Pimenton was my favorite, followed closely by cebolla.  The ajo was a little salty for me but still delicious, and the chimmi churri, though flavorful and tangy like chimmi churri usually is, was surprisingly thin.  This place rocks.  I love everything about it.  Every aspect of our dinner--quality of food, portion size, decor, price point--was right on and beyond reproach.  Service was extremely friendly, efficient, and knowledgeable.  Hell, even the weather was perfect for eating outside on the little patio facing Penn Avenue!  A very, very easy 5 stars.",

Let me give some kudos to the staff. They could see it was my \"maiden voyage\" in the shop and they were helpful and informative.  I went with the Carne Steak sandwich with NY strip in it. They add fried onions, red bell pepper and a special steak sauce. It was delish! I added a side of potatoes and loaded up on some sauces.   I can't wait to go back and try another dish.",

The last time I went, I ordered the Carne, a fantastic steak sandwich with your choice of steak, marinated and grilled peppers and onions, served on a fresh bun that's doused with some delicious oil/butter/garlic combo. It was heavenly! The prices here are extremely reasonable and it's BYOB, so it's well worth the long wait in line that wraps outside the building that you will probably encounter (ours was 75 minutes on a very cold day). So bring your booze and someone fun to talk to in line and enjoy your experience at Gaucho!!",

But the food is just *so good* that it doesn't matter. I will come back again and again.    It's not fine dining, but my favorite thing on the menu is the steak sandwich made with ribeye steak.  Nearly all of the food is cooked directly over their incomparable wood-fired grill.  The house-made authentically Argentinian sauces complete the sandwich, so don't be shy and be sure to try them all!  I can't decide if I like the pimenton (smoky red pepper) or ajo (garlic) better!  If you'd looking for a side dish, I can't recommend the grilled veggies enough.  Who knew that something so simple could be so delicious?  Also: I say skip the paella.  It was fun to eat as a group, but it lacked so much in flavor.  Arrive early or in the middle of the afternoon to beat the wait.  BYOB!",

    "text": "Stopped here for lunch after a long morning  shopping at the Strip.  Let me start off by saying the food is pretty darn good. It is inventive and full of flavors. They also have an area of a few homemade sauces (chimichurri, Etc) along the side that you can go get. The bathroom is clean and spacious, though theres only 2 single-person bathrooms, which draw a line quickly when the restaurant fills up. But to me it just wasn't enough to overcome the lackluster experience.  First, the menu is huge and written on the wall in chalk. Well, if there's anyone behind you, you have no time to crane your neck enough to be able to pick something that sounds like it would be okay.  Then you are given all your drinks up front, while paying and tipping at the register. I didn't know that. So my boyfriend left to get a table and set our bags down, and I was left juggling drinks and my purse and a few shopping bags up the stairs to the dining area. Our food was brought to us, a plus. But, we didn't know how to get a drink refill; do we go back up to the register? Is there a waiter? We were so confused. So we waited and waited and someone came and asked if we wanted refills, and took at least 10 minutes to bring them back, I am guessing because the restaurant was pretty full and they were also taking food orders out.  I also can appreciate quality food and ingredients, but I did think the prices were a bit high on some items. I got the Large melted provolone appetizer for the table, but it came out as 2 small slices of bread with cheese on it, which we had to cut into pieces to feed all of us. The side of broccolini was 2 long florets and a couple green onions. I just didn't get it, to be honest. The rosemary beef sandwich was pretty excellent but was too dry without some kind of condiment so I used the homemade chimichurri to dip it in and it definitely elevated the sandwich a bit.   Maybe its something I need to get used to. I just didn't realize it was that kind of place from the reviews and from the exterior/interior look and feel of the establishment.  I might give it a shot again....maybe.",

    "text": "What to get: deconstructed steak sandwich, grilled vegetables Service: 5/5 Atmosphere: trendy, casual Wait: 20 mins (Tuesday 6PM for 1) Parking: street  The Experience: [August 2016] One of the best meals I've had to date. It was worth the visit from out of town. I'd visit Pittsburgh again for this place.  Located in the Strip District(?), this street is filled with ethnically diverse shops and restaurants.  There's a lot of one way streets in the area, so you may have to loop around like me to find a spot. I'm a chicken when it comes to city parking, so I parked hella far from the restaurant, but it was street parking. Walking to the restaurant, Penn Ave is reminiscent of a smaller Chinatown, but a lot more than cultures. The place is at the very end of the street.  If you think coming with a tiny group (aka party of 1) will get you seated faster, you're wrong. The line weaves in and then out of the entrance along the sidewalk. I'm no stranger to long waits, but just a heads up if you want to come with people. If it weren't so popular and busy, I'd come here with the girls for a girls' night out with an accompaniment of wine. It certainly looked like the thing to do when I was eating there and all the groups were merrily dining and drinking wine around me.  I chose the deconstructed steak sandwich and a plate of grilled vegetables for some variety. The meat was PHENOMENAL. I need to learn better vocabulary for food descriptions, but the steak was perfectly marinated and flavorful. I could have just eaten steak for my entire meal! The crisp toast and marinated and grilled vegetables were a fantastic complement to the beef. Only way to improve this meal was to have a glass of red wine to go with it.  I still drool over my pictures of the dinner I ate there and I wish other cities were blessed with this kind of luxury as well. I'd say this is one of the key places to visit while in Pittsburgh. Nothing short of amazing.",

There are plenty of beef options so if your only restriction is pork, you'll find that the selection is pretty good.   More than the actual dishes, what I absolutely love here are the three sauces that are offered. My favorite one, hands down, is the chimichurri sauce (it's green). It's amazing and I  fill up multiple sauce cups of it because it is amazing with the lamb.   The line on weekends is usually out the door and I don't think they take reservations. To avoid the lines, I tend to go at awkward times like 3-4 pm before the dinner rush starts. The first time I went, we waited for 1.5 hours outside and then an additional 1 hour for food but we went on a Friday night, I believe. The subsequent times, I went at around 3-4 pm and there was no wait or line.   Overall, a great place!",

The meat is so flavorful it tastes great in any dish! They also offer a variety of sauces that are good to try! Try to come early to beat the crowds!",

This place does not take reservations and you have to wait in line for seating. Called back later on and line died down. Got there and was seated within 30min deff worth the wait. Great steaks and Argentinean flavor. It is BYOB and liquor stores close early around here so come prepared!

The key which I didn't know but know now is to just be rude and push past the line saying a friend is already inside. This happened to me tonight and I'll never go back.  I waited here for almost 2 hours and I had one Guy in front of me.. then his 7 friends show up and I let it slide thinking ok he saved a spot for his friends but yeah 8 of them all Pitt students.  So I let it go and the line slowly moves and right before I got inside a lady and her kid come around the bend and pushed right in.. then I didn't make it in the door and they shut the door on me..  and no this kid wasn't young or crippled or in any way shape and form couldn't wait the dang 2 hours i had to wait.  another 20 minutes of me waiting went by all the time I see the lady and kid go to the counter now to order.. finally I wised up and went to Kuhn's and bought my own flank steak for 8 dollars and 2 dollars of seasoning.  People are probably still waiting in line there now and I already ate.  This place has by far the worst system I've ever seen for a restaurant.  Next time I'll know to fake throwing up and just run inside.  Anywhere else it would probably have lots of fights from the poor queue system",

You can get your favorite cut of steak in small or large size. Also comes with salad, toast, and chimmichurri. And don't forget to try their 4 different sauces!!  You order at the counter and then your food is delivered in a pretty quick fashion. The food is served on these cute wooden platters and the whole restaurant has a rustic hip kind of vibe.   If you want an app, get the roasted carrots which are amazing - marinated with smoked honey and goat cheese, so yum! Heard the sammies are delicious as well so will have to try them the next time I'm in Pittsburgh.   On top of that it is BYOB so how can this place get any better?  Note: they do not accept reservations so come early!",

Came with NY Strip steak, grilled chicken, and chorizo, as well as 2 pieces of toast.  The steak was great, cooked perfectly.  When you pair it with the chimmichurri, it's just perfect.  There's actually 4 sauces, but in the end we both thought the chimmichurri was the best.  The chorizo was also very good, but the chicken was a huge let down down - very dry and not much flavor.   We also got an Argentino salad to share.  The salad was great.  Loved the grilled flavor on the veggies.  The large on its own is definitely a filler, especially if you add protein to it.  For some reason we didn't care for the empanadas.  Both the chicken and the beef were just alright.    Saw a bunch of people ordering sandwiches and it looked amazing.  The toast we had was great so I can only assume the bread on the sandwiches are just as good.  In hindsight, probably should've went with that or just the steak haha.  Be prepared to wait in line.  Apparently we were lucky and only waited for 20-25 minutes.",

    "text": "I've been dying to try Gaucho for so long now. So much hype surrounding this place and I must say it did not disappoint. However, I'm not the biggest fan of the first come first serve concept.   First let's talk food, to simply put it....amazing and absolutely delicious! We tried the beef and chicken empanadas, both were really good but I felt the chicken was a little dry so I dipped it in sauce but still really good and I'd get again. They have a few different choices for empanadas and they are written up front so they change them out. We also had the grilled shrimp and they are grilled to perfection. They have that perfect char grilled tastes. You get 6 shrimp and they are a good size. We opted for the summer squash because we wanted a veggie side and it was good. A nice size side perfect for 2 people and only $6 so definitely worth it. For the main course we had the parrillada mixta which consists of strip steak, chicken, and your choice of sweet or spicy chorizo (we chose the spicy). This dish also comes with 2 pieces of grilled bread which is fantastic. I wanted more bread! The steak was cooked perfectly. The chicken was my least favorite there just wasn't a wow factor for me. Spicy chorizo is also delicious. This dish was a great combo to get your first time to try the different meats so I recommend. It's a big portion too, we had leftovers to take home. They have 4 different sauces for dipping and all of them are amazing. Honestly, the sauces may have been my favorite part. I can't pick a favorite cause they all are so good. I dipped everything we got in each one. Gaucho is also a byob establishment. I think our total was around $50 for all that food which really isn't bad for a good meal.   Gaucho is located in the strip district which means finding parking can be an issue. It is also first come first serve, no reservations. Since this place is so good there is often a line that wraps around the side of the building which is my least favorite part. I wish they took reservations and you didn't have to wait but there is obviously a method to this madness because it's always busy and a very successful establishment. Since it's byob I feel like people will also sit longer to finish their alcohol which makes the line longer. They have a sign that indicates 3-4pm is shift change and they have to feed their employees so the restaurant runs much slower, I went on a Saturday and got in line around 3:20 and was inside and ordered about 45 minutes later which was not too bad. I will say I wouldn't wait much longer. Food is great but I don't want to wait in line any longer than an hour for it.   The inside is small which is also another reason the line can take long. You order at the counter, they seat you and bring the food to your table but you do not have a server. The employees all seemed super friendly and everyone had a smile on their face. The vibe is super casual and relaxed.   I do recommend trying Gaucho if you haven't. The food is unlike any other food I've had in the city. I will def be back but maybe on a week night when the line isn't so long.",

With maybe 15-20 or so people in front of us, the line moved pretty quickly.   After ordering in the front, they tell you what table to sit at. When your order is ready they call your name. All of the sauces are so flavorful and fresh. I liked the caramelized onion and of course the chimichurri too.   The steak in the sirloin was delicious! So flavorful, juicy and that perfect smokiness from the wood oven.   It's well worth it, and Gaucho has great vibes too. Don't miss it!",

    "text": "Gaucho Parrilla Argentina offered a delicious meal and a wonderfulunique dining experience. For those of you who want a short review: yes, eat here, amazing, great service, best steak burger I've ever had, just do it.  To be more detailed about Gaucho, it's enticing from the start. You walk in and order as if you were at a coffee shop. The lines are usually long enough to peruse the entire chalk board menu. They even have guides on what gaucho defines how they cook their meats. From there, you pay upfront and get seated. While you wait for your food, you have the ability to choose different types of sauces that will complement whatever entree you ordered. I sampled every single one.  The food comes (and is outstanding), the service is excellent, and the atmosphere is inviting. The burger was a little more rare than I had expected but still perfection. I can't wait to try more!",

    "text": "After attending CMU from 2009-2013, I was not expecting to find a place like Gaucho.  Maybe I matured past bar food, maybe Pixburgh has really stepped into its own, or maybe a combination of both.  Any which way, this is a must-stop destination after you get in your obligatory run through Primanti's.  My gf and I ordered the asado platter (all five cuts of steak) - there was no way we were going to limit ourselves to a couple cuts.  We also got empanadas, a side of grits, and a side of greens.  Obviously the steak was the best part of the meal.  Very cool experience to taste the subtle differences and textures between the different cuts - highly recommend.  Also, gotta love the bread on top.  The grits and greens were standard, not a must-order but you will want some type of flavor break from the mound of meat.  The empanadas were good, but ultimately it's hard for anything to hold a candle to the steak.",

This is some honest to goodness Argentinian food that will satiate the meat cravings that everybody has once in a while.  We ordered the asado plate (a sampler of all the meats for $50) along with 2 empanadas ($5), one of the beef and one of the vegetarian kind. You get a 24 or 25 oz total of NY strip, flank, sirloin, ribeye, and filet mignon (we asked for medium rare, but some of the pieces were cooked a bit more well-done - no complaints here!).  You can dip the meats in 4 different sauces (the chimichurri sauce is honestly the best) along with a couple loaves of bread that is little bit too burnt for my liking. The empanadas were great (especially the beef empanada) but the vegetarian one is somewhat bland and may have needed some more flavoring.  Overall, a great experience and good place to bring a date. I recommend you come early to avoid a line (we went at around 4:30 - 5 PM on a weekday)",

For the food I ordered the Sirloin plate, and asked for medium rare. The meat was super tough to chew through which was disappointing but had great seasoning. I'd recommend trying all of there sauces that compliment the steak. Besides the meat being tough to chew everything was amazing!  Overall this place is a unique place for Pittsburgh and has a wide variety of Argentinian food. Dispite my meat being tough to chew through I will still return to try the rest of the menu due to the reputation of the restaurant for quality food, and quality customer service!",

Luckily, when I walked by most recently, there were only about 10 people waiting to get in. It was my lucky day!  The menu had so many wonderful options that it was hard to choose. I ultimately went with the 12oz \"Vacio\" sirloin plate, and it was amazing! I loved everything on that plate, from the fresh side salad, to the delicious toasted artisan bread, to the caramelized onions, and finally, to the star of the show - the steak, which was cooked medium as I ordered, with a nice char on the outside. There were a variety of sauces for the steak, but my favorite was the chimichurri sauce. It was nicely herby and garlicky, and its acidity complemented well with the steak.   This platter was definitely a lot of food for one person, but I was so hungry that I finished it. For dessert, I tried some alfajores - one vanilla and one chocolate. I've tried alfajores a few times before, and these were the best I've had! I believe they make them fresh.   The service was great - everyone on staff was so friendly and helpful. They really exuded warm Argentinian hospitality! With such great food and great vibes, I can definitely see why this is a crowd favorite in Pittsburgh.",

The sauces are really fun to try and dip the steak in. Really loved the sausages, preferred the spicy ones. I got too full to even try to empanadas. The flan was just Okay, would skip this next time",

We thought the best way to know the city is to, yes..., go on the double-decker city bus tour.   The tour guide/bus took us to one of many neighborhood in Pittsburgh, including the street that Gaucho was on. It was around lunch time and the line to Gaucho was noticeably long! The wonderful smell of grilled meat emanated from Gaucho's building. My son and I decided to check it out for lunch.  By the time we finished our city tour, made it back to Gaucho, it was almost 3 pm. There was still a line, albeit shorter, to wait for a seat. The wait was absolutely worth it.  We ordered a salad and 6 empanadas. All were good. And we were absolutely stuffed. Our favorite were the beef empanadas.

The first impressions weren't too great--lunchtime on a weekend made the already small place quite crowded, so there was little room to navigate or try to understand the somewhat confusing menu without getting in someone's way.   The menu was clear in what we could order, but the layout made it hard to read (especially the appetizers and veggies going down the side on the left) unless we were already in line, which wasn't optimal since we haven't decided on anything yet. As embarrassing as it was, we could not figure out the difference between the meats by themselves (was it just meat with nothing else?) and the steak sandwich (meat plus.. peppers and onions). And why were some of the pequenos just as expensive as the sandwiches...? We saw a lot of people going with grilled corn, which looked delicious, but we couldn't find it on the menu either (later we realized we could've just added it on). And an extra buck per vegetable on the sandwich?? Call me spoiled but a really nice suggestion would be to just create some combo orders that include something like a sandwich, a small dish, and a drink (water didn't seem to be an option btw).  Okay so we were probably mostly just being silly in failing to navigate the menu properly or get help, but we did end up with two quite delicious steak sandwiches of ribeye and skirt steak. Luckily we were able to find a table outside, and the steak did make up for the confusing experience at the beginning. It was juicy with a touch of char, and the entire sandwich was pretty tender. Next time we'll be sure to know what's going on and know what to order ahead of time.",

The best steak sandwich I can ever remember having. Great chimichurri sauce to. Girlfriend had the shrimp which was very fresh and you could taste the grilling which I find really nice. We also tried for apps the grilled vegetables and chorizo sausage. Everything was excellent. We will be back very very soon!!",

I also got a small salad which was perfectly fresh and delicious, though unnecessary because the sandwich was huge. I really love all the sauces they have available, too. The service really takes Gaucho Parilla over the top - so so so genuinely enthusiastic and friendly! The space is rustically cozy and the sandwiches are a bit messy; all part of the fun. Yep, this place is fun!",

The \"small\" steak plates -- with salad & grilled bread -- are a great value, and our 9 y.o. devoured hers like a tiger. Mom loved her ribeye, and my hanger steak sandwich with roasted red peppers was perfect.  We split sides of patatas bravas & yellow rice, ideal for mopping up the juices.  Don't miss the salsas -- ajo and chimichurri were our favorites, but the pepper and the onion were both tasty & distinctive, too.  The staff were terrific (helpful with a dash of humor), and the snug indoor eating space (a handful of stools and some standing room) is fun if you're willing to be flexible & friendly.  We'll bring a bottle of tinto to take advantage of the BYOB policy next time!",

This was my first visit today and I absolutely had to try it when so many people gave it a five star review.  It definitely is a hip, cool restaurant for the Pittsburgh scene and maybe that is what is clouding people's judgment.  The sandwiches were good but definitely not spectacular.  I has the pulled chicken which was more like pieces of chicken breast meat, definitely not pulled, which was a disappointment.  The Provoletta appetizer was o.k. but basically just melted cheese on top of toast, really nothing overly special.  The sauces that are provided for free were good but, again, nothing outstanding.    It was very pricey with a lunch for two costing $35.  Also, we grabbed the only two remaining seats in the place which were bar stools crammed in the hallway between the kitchen area and upstairs dining area.  Underneath the stools is stacked wood which makes this seating area awkward.  There is no place to stick your legs while eating so sitting sideways is somewhat mandatory.  Plus, my husband bummed his knees a couple of times off of the wood.  I'm not sure who's idea this was but they maybe should have rethought it.    I am glad that I went for the experience but won't be back.",

A different person in the group went up and ordered and we 'snuck through their defenses\" We got the sandwiches and sat in the back room.  we pulled a few chairs together so we could all sit together. The owner / manager came over and took the chairs from our table to put them at an empty table next to us.  We took the chairs back and he took them from our table again.  We took some chairs from a different table, and for some reason, this seemed ok in his pea-brain and he stopped taking the chairs. After this, the food was pretty mundane. I had a steak sandwich that was sliced so thick, it was like eating a steak between two slices of bread. No one at the table was impressed witht he food, and the rude treatment topped it off. No way will we ever go back there.  There are lots of other sandwich shops  that are actually happy to take your money...",

We got two steak sandwiches, which was a mistake! Even though it is SUPER delicious, we couldn't finish it all! We also both got Cokes, which the cashier informed us was made in Mexico, so it was made with pure cane sugar and no HFCS. Man was it good!  We even felt the need to take a small cup of chimmichurri with us! Probably the best steak sandwich I have EVER eaten! If you need a place to eat, come to Gaucho Parrilla Argentina!",

Everything is done over the smoky fire pit they use in the kitchen. The owner a young gentlemen who works the customers in the front of the house is extremely knowledgeable and is a complete pleasure to talk to. I came into this amazing place on sat morning before they opened and hung out and talk to employees for a second and got a good feeling about the place. I took the advice of one of the cooks and got the Flank Sandwich with roasted peppers on a chibata  roll and was AMAZING, The thin stacked meat was cooked perfectly and just feel apart when biting into it. The meat was smoky but not overly smoky and could sill taste the Beef. The sauce they put on it was out of this world. Over All I give it 2 thumbs up. I cant wait to go back.

I had the pollo sandwich with pulled chicken, mushrooms, potatoes, and onions on a focaccia type bread. The bread was delcious and the sandwich alone was enough to fill me up. Most of the other people in our group also got sandwiches and also said they were great along with the grilled corn. Someone got a salad and added shrimp to it. She said the shrimp and dressing were delicious. My only complaint/observation about this place is that there is very limited seating. There is almost no seating inside, so while it was great to eat on their patio during August, I'm not sure how much business they will do in the winter months. I think the food is great and the employees and service was exceptional, I just hope they can find a way to keep it running without seating in the winter.",

You will always hear the typical if having the Pittsburgh staple Primanti sandwich but this is also one heavy delicious sandwich. I had the ribeye sandwich with grilled corn and it was the best steak sandwich I've ever had. The employees there are also wonderful! Very friendly and fun atmosphere. It is a small location but if you can catch a seat outside then I would recommend  to do so.",

Only complaint is it could have been a bit bigger OR less expensive. Also, I wish there were things on the menu in general that were more lunch prices than dinner prices. For non red meat eaters, they also serve a tilapia sandwich. I went back one day to try and get more of that delicious beef in my mouth, but alas though the place was supposed to be open, I (along with other surprised customers) found it closed. It's a pretty serious pet peeve of mine, going somewhere and thinking it will be open but it's not. It's pretty unprofessional, yet many places here do it. I am sure there were reasons etc. and I didn't starve to death since Vietnam's Pho is nearby and a pork sandwich there is half the price and also good, I just went there. But just a note to businesses: your customers notice when you are not open during your regular hours!",

There's not much I can add that hasn't already been said by other reviewers, so I'll just say that their steak sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I've had in my long and illustrious sandwich-eating career. How such a small, ordinary kitchen produces such extraordinary food is beyond me. Just writing this review is making me hungry, so I'll end it now before I get drool all over my nice work shirt.",

There isn't really anywhere to give the menu a wince over and make your choices. That however is the only negative I encountered. The staff, when we ordered we're super nice and helpful. We were shown a table and went to gather our extra plates and tableware. The floor staff made sure our drinks were filled and knew our name for the order to be delivered. When the food arrived it was perfectly cooked, I got the 5 steak option. All seasoned great with perfect char and tender. Wee has the potatoes with roasted garlic cloves , so good. Mushrooms and risotto both were hard to stop eating. There was also pulled pork at the table that was enormous and absolutely excellent. Ended with the chocolate cyan cookie... wow was that good. Really glad we went here and will absolutely go back.",

First three bites had a chicken bone in each bite- one piece was nearly an inch long.  Then, there's the charred-beyond-all-recognition things (maybe onions??) in the sandwich.  Further examination showed undercooked (pink) pieces of chicken.  How they scorched some of it and undercooked some of it is quite a mystery.   Unfortunately, I got my food to go, so I can't complain there.  If you want to risk it, eat there and examine your food carefully before you bite in.

Everyone else got pork, beef or shrimp. My hubby got a pork sandwich. I had a bite and it was really good too. This place is really popular and is expanding soon.

Your teeth slice right through but it's not mushy ... it's just perfect.   The meat is flavored/marinated all the way through. And the wood fired grill makes anything they throw on it taste delicious.   And the sauces! My goodness they are to die for. Try every single one. Chimichurri is of course a winner, but favorite is the white garlic one!   Bonus: I love the fact that they achieve super savory and flavorful food without tons of mayo and cheese. (At least the cheese is optional.) I love that most things are olive oil/herb/garlic based.   We ordered the chicken with a side of grilled vegetables which was obviously tasty, and I hope to get back to try the steak.   Disclaimer: If you are looking for a place for sit down service this is not for you! It's a small cozy space with a few stools inside and tables outside and you order at the register. I can't wait to get down when the weather is nicer!",

As we were deciding what to order, they happily walked us through everything on the menu to help us make good selections since unfortunately, you can't actually eat everything on the menu....but you will want to!  We got the skirt, the rib-eye, the shrimp, mixed veggies, and corn - and every single thing was OUTSTANDING. I didn't realize that I hadn't taken the obligatory \"food photo\" until the plates were already empty (oops, sorry yelpers!)   Pro tip: you might be tempted to overlook it, but make sure to get an ear of corn. I know it sounds simple, but it is amazing...and you too will not believe you when they tell you there is no butter on it! It's also BYOB, but make sure you bring some to share!",

    "text": "The immediate and subsequent surprises you experience when visiting Gaucho Parrilla are more than enough to warrant the five stars that this place has so deservingly received.  I'd heard tell of this place from a few friends, but for some reason when I hear 'sandwich shop' and 'the strip' I can only imagine Primanti Brothers. Sadly that image isn't as appetizing to me is it may be to other Pittsburghers.  Nonetheless, on a whim, my wife and I decided to drop in here to see what's up and it has since completely rewritten the aforementioned image.   Gaucho is the sandwich shop that the-city-that doesn't-need-another-sandwich-shop needed.   For starters, the wood fired grill is expertly manned and the resulting meat and veggie creations are tender and flavorful.   For enders, the guys running the joint are super friendly and seemingly unflappable -- even in the face of a line out the door during a Saturday lunch rush.  Great food, sweet vibe, and friendly service. What more do you want. Stop wasting your money on sub-par, unhealthy sammies.",

    "text": "I've been to Guaucho twice now for lunch, once with my fiance and most recently this past Tuesday with my father.  The inside of this restaurant is quite small and probably seats only around 10 people with seating for 15 or more outside next to the restaurant.  There's not too many decorations inside either although there is a chalkboard menu which you can order from and then on a center table there is an area where you can grab your utensils or serve yourself any of their four sauces.  Both of the times that I was at Gaucho I ended up ordering the Carne for my entree.  The Carne is their steak sandwich which allows you to choose between one of the 5 cuts of steak that they serve and that comes with roasted red peppers and onions on a nice ciabbata roll.  The first time that I was there I ordered the skirt steak but I heard the owner mentioning this last time that it is no longer on the menu and has been replaced by the hangar steak.  So this last time I ended up choosing the rib-eye as the cut of steak that I wanted.  As with all of the meat that I have tried here it had the wonderful wood smoked flavor to it.  My only complaint about it is that it was a bit tougher than I expected and so made for some hard chewing.  We also ended up ordering the large portion of vegetables which I have had both times that I have visited now.  They consist of onions, roasted red peppers, zucchini and asparagus. Surprisingly, this ended up producing my favorite part of the meal as the roasted red peppers have a great natural sweetness to them and when combined with the sweet balsamic drizzle on top, makes for the perfect counterpoint to the wood-smoked flavor.  Honestly, I could probably eat those red peppers all day.  The rest of the vegetables were good as well and most had a hint of the smokiness but none came close to what the peppers absorbed.  My dad was also a big fan of the bread, both the ciabatta that my sandwich came on and also the crostini-like object that came with his meal.  He really enjoyed dipping them into a few of the four sauces that they have laid out for you to taste and even passed up eating more steak to dip some more bread.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely come back here again in the future.  While it has a downside of only being open 10-7 Tuesday-Saturday and also is small, it is well worth the trip to the Strip District.  Their food is pretty amazing and I especially love the smoky flavor on everything that comes out of Gaucho.",

    "text": "It's 2014, right? The experience with a restaurant begins when you look online. Outdated menu, no menu, shitty website.. your anticipation drops. Restaurants: if we have to wait for approval on email reservation \"requests\", forget about it. This seems comparatively more common in Pittsburgh than DC, Baltimore.. Use opentable or have a person answering the phone.  My first minute with Gaucho..  1) Look up ph# on yelp 2) Phone rings 3 times, get a real person. 3) \"GAUCHO!\" \"What are your hours?\" \"11-7\" \"We'll be by later\" \"Ok. Byob BROTHER!\"  I'm already smiling about my meal. Haven't seen the place yet. That's how it's done.  Roll in to the 12-seat spot and the smoky fire hits your nose immediately. You salivate. Your eyes drift across the orange paint and sparse-yet-rustic decorations that give off the gaucho vibe. The wood is stacked high. Orders are placed at the register where friendly service awaits with recommendations and attention.  Food takes a while, the scent teasing you. The oily chorizo app arrived with sandwiches, should have come first. That's about all I can complain about. The chorizo is salty and awesome, if needing some grain mustard though the accompanying toast cuts it. The skirt steak sandwich (got talked out of the ribeye) was INTENSE. Delicious char, perfect temps and medium-rare without request. The house chimi drips onto your plate alongside the healthy dose of onions and peppers, which are all-pro except lightly soft. The bread borders the crunch/soft levels perfectly.   Seriously, best steak sandwich in Pittsburgh. Maybe ever.",

    "text": "I could live without red meat. Chicken and fish, I need, but not red meat. So this review is partly mine and partly my devoted carnivore boyfriend's...  The meat is really tender and seasoned really well. We've had the lomo (filet) with chimichurri, the flank steak with some pepper sauce, and the lomo sandwich. They were all really good. The only issue for me is that the cooking temperatures are not very consistent. I ordered a dish of lomo and my boyfriend ordered a lomo sandwich and mine was medium rare and his was well done... maybe between medium-well and well. He will eat any meat, but I am pretty strictly a medium to medium-well person, so the medium rare was way too raw for me.   He also usually gets a side order of the potatoes and I get the grilled bread. I love that grilled bread. I would install that grill in my home just so I could paint bread with olive oil and grill it like they do.   The guys who work at Gaucho Parillla are total hipsters, but really friendly guys. We've gone around closing before and they've walked out (to smoke? chat? get some air?) and said \"don't steal anything while we're gone!\" and just walked out for a few minutes.   Now, I just asked my boyfriend \"what do you want me to say about the Gaucho place?\" as he has been urging me to write a review. He said \"best meat ever\" and \"it's wonderful\" and when I said \"why?\" (looking for more details), he said \"psht. What do you mean why? You know why!\" So he's not very helpful, but definitely a fan, so take that as you will.   Tip: It's BYOB and the nice guys cooking your meat would enjoy a beer from your 6-pack.",

Pretty annoying set up when it's crowded. Would have 5 stars if it was traditional restaurant service.  Menu could also be more descriptive. One of my party thought they were getting some kind of fries and we got something more like potato salad.  Aside from that, everything was fantastic. Got the lamb and it was cooked pretty rare (which they warn you about and which I was okay with) but it had a nice char and amazing flavor. Other people I was with both got the ribeye option, which was also fantastic, and had a fantastic char, providing the right amount of crisp.  A nice little touch was the side/dipping sauces they provide. There's a garlicy/softrito style sauce that's out of this world.",

The inside is small and isn't truly \"sit down\" (though there are a few places to sit/stand), the patio next door does provide seating and is a great place to eat some meat. Added bonus: it's BYOB, and the staff is always a pleasure.  The steak samplers are the way to go with sides of potatoes, corn on the cob, mushrooms, and/or vegetables. The lazy susan with their sauces is amazing and they are all delicious. We've had less luck with the sandwiches, which are still good, but I thought the rosemary braised beef had too much meat / was too soggy and needed a crunchy ingredient, such as pickled onions or arugula. I also though the empanadas were a little ho-hum.  My biggest wish is that they'd extend their weekend hours later!",

For $12-20 you'll enjoy a prime cut of phenomenal steak, served with a deliciously simple salad and bread. Our first bites had my buddy and I shaking our heads in disbelief. Soooo good. The chimchurri sauces (4 different kinds) are simple, fresh and wonderful; these are a MUST to get the full spectrum of flavor.  Brand-wise, these guys are doing everything right. They've shown a lot of attention to detail, from the sleek wooden plates to the chalkboard walls and hand-stamped take-out bags.   My favorite part, however, was the staff. They were COOL AS #*(%. We came in on off-peak hours and pretty much the whole kitchen greeted us. The manager was obviously as passionate about food as he is about the restaurant. He energetically talked us through the whole menu and spent a good 10 minutes giving us the scoop on other great restaurants when we asked for local recommendations.   Seriously loved Gaucho's.",

I enjoyed the lamb cooked medium rare with some grass. LOL I also had a beefy empanada that I think was prepared right before they brought it to me and was not sitting in the back waiting to be warmed up. It was crispy on the outside yummy, juicy and delicious on the inside. Accompanied with the choice of sauces that they have this place is phenomenal.  I did enjoy the fun atmosphere.

The line was to the door, so I walked around a bit before coming back around 2:30 on a Wednesday. Very small line at that time.  The menu is a bit huge and overwhelming, but I decided pretty quickly on the Carne sandwich. What I was not prepared for was the cashier then asking me to choose between a whole list of meat cuts. I selected the filet, and I'm glad I did.   This steak was tremendous. It made me question why I only eat steak 2-3 times per year. It made me question my whole life. Cooked medium, it was like biting through soft butter. Excellent feel, excellent flavor. The bread had the right amount of interior softness and exterior crunch, and I'm always a fan of caramelized onions (next time I'll probably ask for extra). The sandwich also came with one lone, small pepper right in the middle, and some sauce.  Get to the Strip and eat a sandwich that's not Primanti's.",

    "text": "After much hype and reading the reviews, I decided to go here with my friends for. A nice Friday evening out. To be honest, it was disappointing. We were there early, and I always wondered why there was a line out the door. The reason being that you order and pay up front and hope they have a table. The menu is a giant chalkboard that is kind of hard to read. We luckily were one of a few groups there so we didn't have any trouble.   We got 3 entrees for 3 people. The Large Shrimp, Pork Chop, and the Lamb Shank. We did not get any drinks, sides: or apps. Our total bill before tip $55.00. Now after paying that much, sitting at the table, and getting the sauces. Our food came. The pork chop was a nice portion size that came with a little salad. The lamb shank was a small size that came with some orzo, and the shrimp. 10 little shrimp. Was the food tasty---yes. Was it worth the money? That's another story.  Now listen, I cook a variety of dishes regularly. I' m a novice baker. I'm a foodie and appreciate great tasting food. I understand that portion sizes may be smaller at some places. I have paid for small portions and felt that it was worth the money. But for $18 and to get 10 shrimp that is supposed to be an entree (aka main course)--no matter how good is disheartening. Everyone of us was not satisfied. We all left hungry.   In short--expect a wait, expect to drop a pretty penny, and don't order the shrimp.",

This particular time I ordered the Argentino salad with ribeye, and a side of provoletta. All of our food came out in a timely matter and everything was delicious, especially the ribeye. Their friendly staff, cool setting & delicious menu make this restaurant one of the best in the Strip. I can't wait to come back and try more of their incredible food options--although it will be hard to switch up my order when the steak is so good!",

That almost made me pick a different restaurant.  I don't like carrying my drinks to the table.  And I don't like a TIP jar at the register.  How do you know if you are going to TIP 20% before you have received service. But then I took my first bite.  I am hooked.  My husband and I ordered the empanadas, cauliflower, green beans, beef with rosemary, and the pork sandwich.  We shared everything.  Every single bite was delicious.  It was way too much food for the two of us.  But we managed to eat every bite.  It was that good.  I will definitely be a return customer.",

You walk in and stand in line in front of their huge menu on a chalk board.  You order your drinks first, then the next step in line is ordering your food.  Someone else will ask how many people in your party and then go ready a table.  I had the large ribeye, medium rare with a side of the roasted red potatoes.  My friend had the steak sandwich.  Both got to our table quickly and were cooked how we ordered them.  The salad that came with my steak was terrific, as were the potatoes.  The ribeye was seasoned nicely and sliced, and had two toasted slices of bread laid in top.  The whole thing was a great experience, helpful staff and great food.    I will add that I found it amusing that the 'hipster' (apologies for lack of a better term) appearing staff work at a steak house.  In Seattle,  twenty somethings that look like them would only serve vegan fair trade farm to table food that tastes awful!",

This place is also BYOB and the service style is different which is a nice change of pace.  You stand in line (get there before 6pm for dinner) you will only have about a 10 minute wait.  If you wait later you could wait for a LONG time.  You place your order, find a table, get all your sauces to each on the side, crack your bottle of wine, beer, etc and relax.  Servers will call your order's name and bring it to you.  The last time we were there the servers were super friendly and accommodating.    I have had the meat plate with skirt steak, brussels (spicy and sweet), a filet sandwich, and a skirt steak sandwich in my 3 times there.  The bread they serve the deliciously favored meat on is reason to go alone.  The only thing to be aware of is they serve the meat pretty close to rare/mid rare, so if you don't like meat cooked that way, let then know when you are ordering.  I love the red sauce and the garlic one, but try them all and pick your favorite. This place really is great, so get there sooner than later :)",

    "text": "Carnivore paradise.  Surprised that this place doesn't open more locations or other tried to copy the formula -- line up, order and pay for your food at the counter, grab your little placard, fetch your utensils and sauces,  and wait for a big plate of meat to be dropped off at your table.  The place is BYOB as well.  Outside of the sauces (they are good), I don't really know what makes this place Argentinian -- it could have just as easily be an American grill.  And I hear the lineups get pretty insane, but when we came when there was basically no line.  I got the Parrillada Mixta (NY strip, pulled chicken and chorizo) for $25 for a sampling.  On the menu, it says it's enough for 2... but I'm a glutton.  No complaints, just a good plate of meat and all the various sauces kept it interesting as I went to work.  The service is EXCELLENT despite the order-at-the-counter approach.  The servers kept coming back to top off our water and checking in.  There is a lot of hype attached to this place -- but I think it's good in the fact that it simply doesn't fuck anything up and does it in a very self-serve casual style.  You're probably not going to get the 'best' anything here - and you should expect it for the pricepoint.  But this is definitely a place I would frequent if I lived in Pittsburgh.",

I ordered a \"porky\" empanada, small rib eye with chimmichurri (sub salad with oven roasted red skin potatoes), and the campfire yams. It was all so good. Loved the taste of the char on the outer edges of the meat which was tender and flavorful. the potatoes were awesome- slightly crunchy on outside, buttery and soft on the inside the way a good baked potato should be, the empanada was fantastic- nice and tender pastry, flavorful filling, the yams were good my only critique would be that they could've used some butter. All these things were great on their own, but what sent it over the top was the selection of sauces that you can add on.  my personal favorite was the pimenton- red pepper sauce.  OMG- I could put this on anything and everything.  It was sooooo good. Lastly, the staff (I interacted with about 5 different people while I was there) were all super helpful and friendly- they made the restaurant a warm and inviting place to be. I don't know when I'll be in Pittsburgh again, but I sure hope to make another trip back here when I do!",

    "text": "We had the opportunity to check out Gaucho Parilla late last summer. We were there with our two boys (age 12 and 14). My wife and younger son waited in line while my older son and I went to a local wine shop to grab an adult beverage for the meal. The staff at the restaurant was extremely friendly and helpful. The restaurant was packed but the staff never appeared flustered or made us feel rushed. We were seated and served fairly quickly. We ordered empanada appetizer main courses of beef, chicken and veggies, The food was fabulous and was the dining experience.   We were so impressed that we recently reached out to the restaurant staff to help us with our family Christmas Day meal planning. We wanted to \"mix things up a bit\" for this German/Polish family by switching the dinner to a traditional New Mexican theme.   We wanted to include empanadas but did not feel confident preparing them ourselves. Gaucho enthusiastically helped us customize the empanada ingredients and offered their expertise regarding the best way for us to pick them up on Friday as we drove through Pittsburgh on our trip to Buffalo NY. They \"par-cooked\"the empanadas and packed them up for us. When I arrived at Gaucho to pick them up, the chef brought them out to me himself and took the time to give me his recommendations for completing the cooking process on Christmas Day. He also hand picked and packed up sauces for the empanadas. Very reasonable price.   I was extremely impressed with the attention to detail demonstrated by all the staff, and the care they took to make sure their peice of our family dinner was a success. Our family meal was begun with the empanadas as I pulled them from the oven. They were golden brown and piping hot. The dough was perfectly flaky and the fillings were flavorful and moist. They really set the stage for the rest of the meal.   Thanks so much to all the staff at Gaucho Parilla Argentina for the wonderful product you put on the table, the friendly and casual  atmosphere you create in your dining room and the obvious devotion you show to your customers.   No wonder there's always such a long line of eager diners at their door! It's mostly definitely worth the wait.",

    "text": "Absolutely the best place I ever eaten in Pittsburgh! The place is a little hard to get and finding parking relies on luck, but once you are there, the food is divine!  The atmosphere is a classy, hipster type and the different types of food from snack dishes, to salad, sandwiches or real steak and desserts are there to make up for all the hassle you have to go through to get there. My SO had ribeye steak and I had a steak sandwich. I had to say, the steak was really good...moist and juicy and cooked to your desired level. However, what amazed me was the seasoning they put on the sandwich bread that made me go ooh-aah while eating it. Most of the time, the sandwich places make their fillings taste good but fail miserably with seasoning the buns/condiments that go with it. With Gaucho Parrilla Argentina, however, they get both right!! Even my SO still raved about this place and the place stood out in both our minds when we thought about the best meal we had in Pittsburgh as well!  Price was really reasonable, especially with the portion and such awesome taste you get. The waiter/cashier were super helpful, too. It does also help that the atmosphere is classy/super inviting, too! Go, if you are in Pittsburgh...and definitely make a case to stop and eat at this place even if you are just a visitor in town! Next time I'm back in Pittsburgh...I will hike my way there again! :D",

    "text": "I mean...what is there not to love about Gaucho?! This weekend we had guests from out of town visiting us and knew that we had to take them here. I was excited to come back because I haven't been here since it first opened a few years ago- I was impressed when I saw the amazing work that they had to the inside. We ended up getting here around 1:00 PM on a beautiful Saturday afternoon in PGH. The strip district was buzzing- so I was sure it would be packed here. Luckily, there was only about 10-15 people in line ahead of us and it seemed like the crowd followed us as we stood in line. We only ended up waiting about 25-30 minutes, which worked out great.   When we finally got inside to see the menu, we were overwhelmed with the menu and how amazing everything sounded. We ended up deciding to order a few dishes to split between the 4 of us- this is a great idea if you are coming here with a group so you can get a taste of everything. We decided on an order of 2 each of the empanadas (vegetables, pork, and beef),  side of potatoes, the Parrillada Mixta (NY strip steak, chicken, and spicy chorizo), and the vegetable sandwich (we ordered it deconstructed).  Where do I even begin? Everything was mouth-watering. The meats were all cooked to perfection and were accompanied by the fabulous self serving sauces that they have. You can tell that all the food is super fresh & it all has the perfect amount of char to give it a unique & delicious taste. The empanadas were all amazing and I loved to try the variety of them! They were unique from any other empanadas that I have had before. Even their bread is phenomenal!! My ONLY complaint is that they got rid of the vegetable dish that was on their older menu. We ended up ordering the vegetable sandwich as a replacement but I didn't love it as much as the older vegetable dish- please bring it back!!   Aside from the fabulous food, the interior of Gaucho is also a winner. As I said before, the renovations that they have done in the last few years are outstanding! I love that they are able to fit more people inside and it is still super spacious and a comfortable environment. The staff is also helpful and very kind here. Most importantly... Gaucho is BYOB! I always love a good BYOB spot. I promise you- if you see a line here, stand it, and wait... it is so worth it! Can't wait to come back again!",

If you have a problem with waiting in line (or you're that person that will endure but complain about the line to everyone waiting), don't kill the vibe and head down to McDonald's... You can see it from the line.  Also, it's BYOB. So grab a bottle of wine on your way. Or two, one for dinner, one for the line.",

    "text": "Lots of talk about this place. My brother and his wife have attempted it a few times but the line was always too long. Another friend said it's one of his favorite places but you have to go early or on a week night.   After browsing the strip for an hour or two, we made our way here around 330 on a Saturday. The line had about 15 people waiting outside so we went for it. I mean, a line means one of two things: slow, poor service and being unable to serve your diners in a reasonable manner, or the food is THAT good that it's worth the wait and that's why so many people are willing to wait. Judging by the reviews, I was assuming the second.   It took us about 45 minutes to get to the ordering part finally. I got what my friend recommended, carne sandwich with sirloin. I split it with my husband and my friend got the pollo sandwich for herself. After ordering, we got sat right away. Our food came out in under 15 minutes. There were 2-3 empty tables in the dining area we were in during the entire time we were seated and eating, so this is where I begin to beg the question--why the wait? It took 2-3 minutes to order and we literally got seated right after. As did the group in front of us and the group after us. Food comes out quick. You eat quick and go. It's in between fast food style dining and normal dining so again, why is there this extreme wait? Yeah, the place is small. But it's a quick turnover. You get up and can refill your own water and grab your own sauces, extra plates, napkins etc so service time isn't the answer either. It just baffled us.   Back to the food, it was pretty good. The steak was seasoned well and cooked to medium rare like we asked. I will say, I understood upon first bite why they have the deconstructed sandwich option. My friend's chicken sandwich was no hassle, but every bite I took into mine pulled the entire slab of steak right off the sandwich. And the onions and peppers. So I basically ate mine deconstructed style, though it was unintentional. I'd recommend ordering any carne sandwich that way for future reference.   I'd say the sauces were the game changer and kept this from being an overall 2 experience. Pretty unique and all clearly freshly made. There was a sweet onion one, a roasted red pepper one, a garlic butter one (think Papa John's garlic butter dip on crack), and one just called \"yummy\" which cracked us up, but was indeed yummy. Reminded me of an Italian dressing, as it was thinner than the others. Having those flavor options to dip and spread made a difference.   I wanted to be wowed by this place and have it be a definite 5-stars. While we all agreed it was good, that's it. Just good. Not good and worth the long wait. Not good and unique atmosphere or something quirky to set the place apart because it's much like any hipster, exposed-beam-decor place popping up in any city. Not good and I'm already planning my next visit. Just good with some pretty cool sauces. Lots of people were getting takeout orders while we waited in the long line, perhaps that's the secret?",

The staff were all so pleasant, I wouldn't have guessed they were busy if I couldn't see it for myself. The space is small, but we had no trouble finding a table. There's an outdoor space as well. The windows make the atmosphere so light and airy.   We ordered the vegetable plate to split. Yum! Chicken and beef Empanadas were alright... i preferred the beef. The real star was the pork sandwich house special. Lucky for hubby, he ordered it! It was tender and favorful. I really liked it! I had the Carne flank cooked medium rare. Both sandwiches had so much meat! The sauces and spices added flavor, not super spicy like I thought! See pictures for more info!",

While the seating situation isn't really optimal, the quality of food and the attitude of the people working there really makes up for it.  There's something great about having an expertly cooked steak sandwich while you smell the wood that they use to fire their grills.  The food is a little on the expensive side, but as long as you can get a seat it's definitely worth it to come here.  I'd recommend coming a bit off of normal eating hours since it quickly gets mobbed on the weekends.",

I have never been one for Argentine style empanadas so this is probably just bias, still the sandwich was so good I had to give this place 5 stars.   I went with a couple of co workers and we all kind of sat around in contemplative silence when we finished, brains working hard to recall a better sandwich.   We all had different sandwiches but left with the same feeling, so I would say feel free to try any, these guys take real pride in what they prepare.

    "text": "Hmm..after having read so many reviews I probably had very high expectations . I am not saying the food wasn't good but probably not as much as I read about it. Or it could probably be that I didn't order their signature Rosemary steak.. I ordered Pollo (chicken) sandwich and it was very average . The red sauce was good but one of the sauce was terrible.. I really loved the cookie and infact bought a few more to go as well. Will try their steak next time to be fair .. But for whatever I ate today I will give only 4..",

    "text": "We love it.  I have tried to find fault, but the food is consistent, the chimmi is flavorful, fresh and free, the settings is clean and casual.    I am usually frustrated with how stodgy Pittsburgh is when it comes to convention and I'm glad to see Gaucho break with the typical, \"sit down and wait an hour for your food\" routine.  As in Nashville and other foodie cities, you line up at the counter, with a large printed menu on the wall to look at as you wait, then you place your order and choose your own seat.  They'll hand you your drinks on the spot and bring your food out when it's ready and usually, that's not too long.  I gave it 5 stars because the food is as good as it gets, but there is one notable flaw. The line is insanely long.   I wouldn't say Gaucho is to blame for such a long line (other than producing a hit restaurant) but they generally have exactly 1 person working the line/ringing people up even if nearly 100 people are waiting. Sometimes the same person gets all the drinks, takes all the orders, and rings each person up.  If a party of 4 pays separately and asks questions about the menu or for recommendations, you might wait 15 minutes for one table of people to place an order.  This makes the wait longer than necessary, even with Gaucho's great popularity. I can't think of another business where that flies.    I can see that if they had more than one register, there might not be enough tables, but we've never been forced out without a seat but we have waited for over an hour to place our order...   Keep up the excellent food, Gaucho.  You've already broken with tradition, but tweaking the way you take orders is in order.  No restaurant, no matter how lauded, is guaranteed permanent success and it's always a good move to consider your customers first.",

With no hostess in sight we were left trying to read the huge black board menu. At least half of it is in another language. Finally some from behind the counter filling water glasses gave us the scoop. This is actually like a fast food restaurant. You have to pick your drinks, order your food, and then find yourself a table. Now we realize there isn't any silverware or plates, you have to get them yourself too. I had the ribeye which was good but it was over cooked to med-well when I ordered med. The salad that came with, it was served actually on top of the steak and was drenched in some oily dressing. Terrible. I guess that was something else nobody told us about, and we forgot to ask with all of the confusion. You can't pick your own salad dressing. Next time I'll pick an american themed restaurant.",

The person taking our order did a great job of answering all of our questions. The menu was on a chalk board and there were some things that didn't have an explanation of what they were/what was in them. They were out of bread, so there was no bread for sandwiches or to accompany the plates.  I ordered the flank steak plate. The meat was seared well to lock in the juices. It was very juicy and tender with a wonderful crispy outside. It could have been fine on its own, but I couldn't pass up the flavors in the sauces they have available as condiments. They made fantastic accents to the meat. Since they didn't have bread to accompany the meal, I got a bowl of saffron rice. I thought it was pretty bland. I traded a piece of flank steak for a piece of NY Strip on my colleague's plate. They NY Strip was just as good if not slightly better.",

    "text": "The approach to this review deserves the same respect parrilla master Anthony gives his food... simple and straightforward.  Gaucho's menu is based on a few great quality ingredients, traditional bold flavored condimentos, and simple preparation - the very antithesis of typical Pittsburgh food.    For those that may not be familiar with Argentinian cuisine it leans pretty heavily toward meat, particularly beef, given the amount of livestock raised (average yearly individual consumption is north of 200 pounds).  I'd say that's a good start to any menu concept.  The range of beef cuts allows for varied textures and flavors to be experienced, anywhere from fattier and tender ribeye to a lean and moist filet - all with a bit of char on the edges.  What separates Gaucho from most restaurants in this city is the means in which all menu items are cooked.  The continuously stoked hardwood coals of the parrilla impart a flavor and texture that can only be achieved by the hands of a great pit master... simplicity is key in preparation and grilling, but it takes a great amount of skill to execute perfection on each cut of steak, chicken, shrimp, or fish.  If you're not in the mood for a great piece of steak (I say this in jest, as I don't believe this is a possibility) or aren't fully prepared to devote the next 4 hours of your day to a food induced coma, there are plenty of other menu items to entice your palate and [potentially] not weigh you down.  The following are a few favorites:  Gaucho Papas - one may think potatoes are just filler, but the intensity of flavor from the hardwood roasting complimented by fresh rosemary will slap you across the face for not considering them as a primary option.  Empanadas - different than most other Latin American varieties which are usually fried or baked in a typical oven, these are charred just slightly from the parrilla to give you a whole different flavor profile from what may be expected. tender meat, sweetness from charred vegetables, and a perfect amount of salt from the olive.  bite off the tip and drizzle in the condimentos... the roof of your mouth and your taste buds will both thank you.    Provoletta - it's grilled provolone with oil, herbs, and lemon. i don't think this needs further explanaton.  Vegetales - few places get me excited about vegetables. the balance of char to natural sweetness is taken to another level with a fig drizzle. great variety of vegetables in the mix to give you a few different textures.  Camarones - sweet, plump, translucent and crisp.  charred with rosemary and olive oil.  words cannot describe.  Chorizo - simple and well made, mellow heat in the spicy type and a well rounded flavor in the garlic version.  not phenomenal, but solid.  Carne con pan - the best deal you can find here.  your choice of any cut of steak topped with charred peppers and onions, slathered with chimichurri, and sandwiched between two pieces of toasted ciabatta.  meat juices and chimichurri unite to soften the bread and give you the best bite they have to offer.  I'm almost sad to say that I haven't ventured into the realm of pollo (damn you chicken latino for always being the first door I pass in that direction) or pescado yet, but timing is everything... they only supply enough to get through the day, and it's usually gone if you get there later in the evening.  I respect them that much more knowing that things are going to be fresh whenever I do get the chance to eat it.  Condimentos - in all honesty if these weren't part of the Gaucho experience, the menu would still be successful, albeit significantly less flavorful.  luckily they are part of it, and you would be selling yourself short if you didn't try all 4 of them on some toast, a sandwich, meat, potatoes, a spoon, the floor, or just drink straight from the mason jar (don't do that, out of respect for Anthony and co.)  traditional flavors to enhance any of the aforementioned items... don't be surprised when you're taken aback by how critical these are to your meal, and don't hesitate to mix them: a) chimichurri - made the way god intended by way of fresh herbs, salmuera (salt brine), red wine vinegar, and just the right amount of garlic and chili flake to make you reconsider why you put ketchup on anything. b) ajo - roasted garlic, fresh thyme, oregano, rosemary, olive oil and salt (don't quote me, I'm trying to reverse engineer his recipe).  this should be the modern day mayo, thankfully it's not because there may be a garlic shortage in the world if that were the case. c) cebolla - caramelized onions and herbs with vinegar and oil.  sweeter and less assertive than the ajo. d)pimenton - sweet roasted pepper flavor with herbs and a hint of char.  There is only one way to appreciate the balance and complexity of flavors produced at Gaucho - stop in just once, and I can just about guarantee you'll be back to try everything they offer.",

I called up to place my order and was told by a young woman that \"we are very busy and might not be able to get to it.\" After picking my jaw up off the floor, I vowed I wouldn't go back.  But after a few weeks of jonesing for the grilled veggies, I decided to give them one more try.  This time a very pleasant young man took my order.  Although there was a line of 8 people perusing the chalkboard menu, I got to scoot right up to the far side of the register, pay, and scoot right home. The grilled veggies were excellent. I also got a rosemary braised beef sandwich which was also very good, albeit a bit on the soggy side, even though I only live about 10 minutes away.  Parking on Penn was a little tough, you might have to park a block or two away.  They might want to consider getting a hold of the empty (but blocked off) lot next door.",

The steak had been perfectly cooked, and had great smoked flavor  That wasn't overpowering.  Overall great balance of smokey and spicy.  If you plan to come around noon during the week , be prepared to wait as the line might be out the door.  Yes , the wait is a slight inconvenience .

The portion size of the sandwich is perfect, the service is prompt, and it's nice that you pay up front so you don't have to wait around for a check. The food is so incredibly flavorful and the sauces are to die for.",

We came about 4pm and only had to wait 30 minutes to order which I hear is towards the shorter end. The staff are all super friendly and helpful so be sure to tip because they all share tips and they definitely deserve it! We got empanadas, a carne sammich with skirt steak, and a small skirt steak plate. THE BEST PART IS THEY HAVE 4 SAUCES THAT ARE ALL AMAZING AND YOU CAN HAVE AS MUCH AS YOU DESIRE!! We also got our food fast and it was so delicious. My mouth is still full of flavor! Definitely recommend but don't go at peak lunch or dinner time if you don't want to wait a long time.",

The long line actually gives you time to browse the amazing menu wish so many choices. It's BYOB with no corkage fee but this was lunch. The guy filling drinks was helping people on what to order and showing pictures of meals on his. phone. As I was checking out the girl at the register was giving me tips about the place.  You get your own silverware and sauces off the wall that was a first.  Waiters and Servers stopped by several times to check on my drink even while this place is packed. Food was immaculate. People continued to check on my meal and refill my drink.  Highly recommend to anyone",

I've gone to gaucho a handful of times now and I've NEVER been disappointed. Not only is the food incredible the staff is amazing and I always try and leave them a glass or two of wine (( everyone loves BYOB!)).  There are a ton of options. Sandwiches, meat platters, salads, small bites and you honestly CANNOT go wrong. For first timers, I recommend the parrillada mixta (a platter of various meats gaucho has) with a bunch of whatever sides you want. It's a great way to get a feel for what this place is capable of!  Yesterday my boyfriend and I went and got the asada platter (incredible) , the mussels (also incredible), and the camarones* make sure you squeeze the lemon on top*  (did I say incredible?).   There are only 2 things I'm not a fan of  1:  The chicken. I'm super picky about the way chicken prepared and unfortunately, on several occasions I've found it a little dry here. Sucks because chicken is great.  2. At night I wish they would dim the lighting to create a more intimate/cozy atmosphere   HOWEVER, don't get it twisted ladies and gentlemen! This place still deserves 5stars for its deliciousness, friendly staff, and consistency.",

I have yet to hear a bad thing about the place and maybe I'm a pessimist... but I didn't believe anything could be that perfect.  I drove nearly 5 hours non-stop from North East Pennsylvania... landed in the Strip District and immediately walked up the street to Gaucho Parrilla. I ordered the steak burger with onions and peppers. It was large, it was mouthwatering good, and although I was completely full and satisfied, I had to debate with myself on why I shouldn't order a second one to scarf down!  Gaucho is perfection. I can't imagine why anyone would go anywhere else. From the friendly staff, to the most delicious steak I've ever tasted, to the interior and layout. Everything is perfect. The 5-star rating isn't a fluke... it's that good.",

    "text": "My wife and I made an unexpected overnight stay in Pittsburgh on our way home from Niagara Falls recently. After checking into our hotel, we hit up Yelp to find a great place to eat in the Steel City. I used the search filters and found Gaucho Parrilla by searching \"highest rating.\" As soon as I started looking at the pictures, it dawned on me that I had stalked their page within the past year because I had seen their restaurant named on the Yelp top 100 list (#7). We immediately made plans to head straight to Gaucho. After driving around the block a few times, I wasn't too sure if we would be able to find a parking spot for the massive SUV rental, but we were finally able to get a good spot on the street just down a bit.  We loaded up the parking meter and started making our way towards Gaucho... as we got closer and closer, I could smell the meats cooking in all of their meaty glory. I wasn't particularly hungry that day, but the smells emanating from the place took care of that in no time. Upon entering, everyone was super friendly and very helpful when it came to introducing us to their menu and pointing out a couple of options that would be great for first time Gaucho-ers. We tried the meat platter (Beef, Chicken, and Sausage) as well as the pulled pork with caramelized onions (My personal favorite). I have to say, I would be hard pressed to remember a meal that I enjoyed more than the one we had that night... the flavors at Gaucho are on another level of amazingness. If you are anywhere near Pittsburgh, go out of your way to try Gaucho, you will not be disappointed.",

I've also had the pollo a la parilla (half roasted chicken) which I really loved the even though it didn't come with any sides. But the chicken was cooked so perfectly that it didn't matter that it didn't have any sides. The empanadas have always been really good too. My favorite ones are the veggie. Both times I went, they did not have the chicken wings which I have been told is a must try.   This place can get expensive depending on what you order. The lamb was $16 while the chicken was $12 (I liked the chicken a lot better). Even though it's really busy and crowded, the service has always been great.",

    "text": "Okay yelpsters failed me. Im trying to figure out why this place has 4.5 stars? The place is a cool hipster place, staff was extremely friendly; however, this place is flawed in a few but major ways. First of all, the menu is this HUGE \"mural\" written on the wall in chalk. I think this menu is a little extensive to be written on a chalk wall and luckily it wasnt crowded or we would have felt super rushed trying to figure out what we wanted in line. Secondly, I personally dont think ordering filet mignon at a counter and waiting on your food to arrive is acceptable. It felt so weird ordering 65 dollars worth of food and going to sit down to wait for your order to arrive. At least they actually brought it to us I guess. But dont expect to get asked if you need anything. Its self service after that. And lastly the food was good but not bragging good in my opinion.   I CAN say that the filet would have been amazing had it actually been cooked to medium well as we requsted. One of them was definitely on the lower end of the medium spectrum and the other one was closer to medium well but not quite. Since the steak was sliced already  and topped with chimichurri, I didnt want to send it back but clearly was not medium well and I think cooks should be able to recognize this before sending it out, especially with it being sliced already. Flaws aside, this goes in the book as one of the most tender, juicy, and most flavorful pieces of filet mignon I've ever eaten and Ive eaten a lot of filet mignon in my lifetime. The chimmichurri paired very well with it. It complimented it unlike a lot of places that serve chimi as a necessity to cover up lack of flavor.   I also had two beef empanadas. The cashier told me that the beef wasnt  just shredded beef and it was pulsed through a blender so I was expecting a \"picadillo style\" filling but made with pulsed beef instead of ground beef for a more gourmet filling; however, I was disappointed to find it filled with dry, long chunky pieces of shredded beef. There were a couple of olives mixed in but the beef empanada didnt make the cut at all in my  book. It was very dry inside.  And lastly, the proveleta. This was very good. Ive never had anything like it before but it is a thick slice of provolone cheese, seasoned with herbs and fried on each side leaving a delicious crisp on the outside and chewy goodness through the middle. It is served on grilled toast. I ate it with the chilled grilled vegetable medley that came with my steak plate to make \"bruschetta\" and it was very good that way.   Overall, this place has some decent eats but not good enough to write back home about. Obviously im in the minority with this opinion so I guess this is one of those try it yourself places....you might love it.",

    "text": "This was my first time here. Since I have moved from Pittsburgh they have definitely done an amazing upgrade to its foodie scene and this place fits right in. If you come here though you are most likely going to have to wait in a long line that usually goes fast (that's if their POS system doesn't go down like it did tonight) that was the only down fall lol they said last time it was down for 2 hours. We waited for 90 min but the food is definitely worth it. They have flavorful selections cuts of steak cooked to your liking. I chose the steak medium well and it wasn't over cooked and was tender. They have difference sauces you can use to put on your food. My favorite was the garlic one. I also got the roasted vegetables with a fig dressing that was very good. And the peanut butter bread pudding was a perfect ending. It wasn't too sweet and very soft.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely amazing and worth it's #7 national yelp spot. Came on a Saturday so there was a bit of a wait [surprisingly only about 30 minutes total though which is unexpected]  They have their menu up on a chalkboard when you come in and a few people pop in and out from behind the bar in order to make sure that you understand or can assist you with the menu. Be prepared to eat bread covered in delicious meat. The steak is absolutely phenomenal. I opted for the con carne sandwich on ciabatta with the arrechera [flank steak] meat [which isn't even the lomo filet] and I was amazed. It's also covered in Chimi and caramelized onions, which I adore. I had a side of a chicken empanada [which wasn't my favorite] but for those who wants a tad of spiciness in their selection, a good option to have.   KB has destined for a bread binge. Each portion of Tostados are 2 large supple pieces of toast grilled in olive oil just waiting for that great opportunity to be dunked in one of gaucho's 4 ridiculously well-crafted dipping sauces. We overzealously ordered 3 orders of Tostados. That's a lot of bread and a lot of dipping sauce. But SO worth it. In general, this WHOLE PLACE is SO worth it.  The only downside to this place is that my picutre of my meal did not get more likes on Instagram, but i think that may be outside gaucho's control. Loving it. Gaucho, you make Pittsburgh proud!",

    "text": "Yesterday a friend texted, \"Want to try Gaucho's?\" I'll go anywhere and my hubs said people have been talkin' about this place so unbeknownst to what I was getting myself into, I agreed.  This place does not take any reservations. For that fact alone, I wanted to go at 3pm. Especially because it was Saturday. I said to my friend, \"Only crazy people go to a good place during dinner time on a Saturday.\" Well - we turned into those crazy people. Not necessarily on purpose, but as the events of the evening unfolded, our party of 4 became THOSE PEOPLE who went to Gaucho's on a Saturday night. At 7pm-ish. And we wind up arriving to find a massive line around the block.  I have not stood in any line like this EVER in Pittsburgh. Correction - I have - just once - for preschool sign-up - but even still I was done with that in 20 minutes. This line? We waited in it for 1 hour and 50 minutes (just to order). In the rain. I mean we arrived, I saw this line, and I said to my friends, \"What the hell have you gotten me into?\" I had not researched this place. I did not see it's insanely long list of positive Yelp reviews. I felt like I was back in high school waiting for concert tickets. Fortunately, I wasn't yet hungry so I didn't care.  With all those details (long line, long wait, rain, etc) - I feel strongly there is no one other than me that had the highest of expectations for this meal. Did it deliver? Absolutely. And in exciting news, even though the wait was painful - the food was delivered fast after we were seated. For the delicious food, I would give this location 5 stars. If there's no wait - read this review as 5 stars and then go. But for the insanely painful wait and the wish that they could figure out some better solution so no one has to wait 2 hours? That's why I subtracted a star. I mean, the way this location is set up, if you're waiting, you can see the people inside eating. And you're like 4 feet away from them. While we were in this 2 hour line, I saw a man inside take 6 minutes to eat his last bite of salad. Everyone else in this party of 4 was done eating and this one person WOULD NOT STOP TALKING and just HAD to finish the last bite of salad on his plate. Fine! But you know what? When people are standing outside in the rain, waiting to eat, we're giving you death stares from the window thinking, \"STOP TALKING, TAKE YOUR DAMN BITE, and be on your way!\" - The fact that any restaurant could entice this kind of emotion or thought process is why I subtracted a star. I mean - our party of 4 had a fun experience but sometimes you don't want an *experience* - sometimes you just want to eat a delicious meal.   So here's the summary: 5 star food 5 star employees No reservations - so plan your time and hunger accordingly BYOB - don't forget a bottle opener FYI on those nights when the wait is insane, most people start drinking in the line ... one poor party of 4 ahead of us DROPPED THEIR BOTTLE OF WINE - it was terribly sad. Don't leave the butterfingers in your group in charge of the only thing that will keep you sane while you subject yourself to the weather and hunger games. And if you so decide to be those crazy people who go on a Saturday night like us at dinner time, bring LOTS of BYOB but do yourself a favor, don't forget some plastic cups and/or class it up by have your pregame prepared with SOMETHING in a travel coffee mug. I can't even remotely condone public drinking - I would actually be scared to open beer or wine while in line (we waited until we were inside) but I regretted not having something in hand for 2 hours.  Oh yeah - and that peanut butter bread pudding dessert? JUST SAY YES",

They have chimichurri  sauce and 3 others you can choose to add to your food. They were a grilled onion sauce, a red pepper and tomato sauce and a garlic sauce. The only one I didn't use was the pepper/tomato sauce. The other three were an excellent addition. I also tried the vegi empanada which I wasn't fond of but I'm an empanada snob so my expectations are high especially when you use the word empanada which shouldn't have been used here. It was more like a vegi turnover but if they called it that I would have never ordered it.  The employees are so friendly and helpful. They had big smiles and that goes along way.  The line was long but seemed to go fast. It was definitely worth the wait. The only thing I was disappointed in was the sides. They really could do better with the options.  It was very unique that you could buy a bone for your dog for $1. Awesome way to keep from wasting them.   I can't wait until the next time.",

I suggest you try one of the empanadas, which are all unique and flavorful. The side of charred bread is so good.   Please keep in mind that there is usually a long wait that wraps around the outside of Gaucho's front door. Dress warm in the winter months. It's worth the wait!",

    "text": "I feel like I arrived pretty late to this party. At least we're there now! Clearly it was better late than never.   I held off in the beginning because past experience with Argentinean restaurants had been underwhelming - typical seemed to always be piles upon piles of mediocre meat. Well I stand corrected! This isn't what they deliver at Gaucho. Here you get incredible flavors infused into their meat dishes with well thought out sides and enhancements also packing a punch for your taste buds.   We had the good fortune to sample 3 of their dishes at a Yelp Elite event held at The Pittsburgh Winery. The guys from Gaucho were memorable in personality and their food was absolutely unforgettable.   I ordered their skirt steak which comes with a salad and bread at their restaurant the other day and honestly I may have to order it several more times before I'll be able to stray to other menu items. Yep, that perfect!  I have no idea how much effort goes into making that skirt steak taste this amazing but I know I certainly will be eating this again & again! It came served over mushrooms and onions that were also infused with all that flavor. Home run!  It's very obvious that the team who works here love what they do and their enthusiasm is pretty contagious. They are beyond thrilled that something they enjoy doing so much has been so well received by our city. They started off with such a small space that it's been tough to get in - another reason it took us so long to get here. Soon that will change when they expand their space next door. It's a classic success story: start small doing amazing food, crowds will come & you grow your business.   We will return to Gaucho & next time it won't take so long!",

The salad was $5 and really tasty with red curly leaf lettuce, radish, grape tomatoes and shaved carrots. It had a yummy but not heavy salad dressing, which I really enjoyed. The Asado Platter was $50 and included a small portion of each of the five cuts of meat. Flank, sirloin, filet mignon, NY strip, and ribeye. My favorite was the filet and my boyfriend's favorite was the sirloin. Every cut was super tender. The chimichurri sauce was the best of all the sauces. Also, the Asado Platter is absolutely way too much food for two people. It's a 4 person portion and comes with toast. Definitely recommend this place!!",

I also love that the sauces are available separately because I'm a spice-a-phobe, but my boyfriend isn't, so we can both be happy. The sides were also excellent. The grilled corn they had in the summer was great, but every side I've tried has been good.  I was tempted to deduct a star for the lack of seating, but the food is just too good! Just be ready to eat it standing up. This place is tiny. It is better in the summer when they have the outdoor seating available.",

Also must try the dipping sauces they have out! All of them were bursting with flavor. I also ordered the alfasmorez which was a twist on a s'more nilla wafers,marshmallow, chocolate, and ready for it? Dulce de leche! (Caramel) sooooo heavenly! (Must have a sweet tooth for this though)  While waiting I saw a bunch if delicious things being served. I also realized we should have came earlier in the day because since everything seems to be in house made they run out later In the evening. First come, first serve. Everything looked and smelled great! Service was also friendly and funny! All in all a gem I never expected to find. Will be returning soon.",

Sandwiches are really to die for ... this is one of the few joints that I know that knows how to do sandwich bread just right. In particular my favorite sandwiches are the carne and the rosemary braised beef varieties. Any of the steak meat cuts you choose is guaranteed to be tender, lean, and juicy ... go for medium rare (you won't regret it). I also really liked their corn ... never knew that a cob cooked over a wood fire grill could be so delicious. Good small eats include the gauchos papas (seasoned roasted potatoes), which taste amazing due to the seasonings that they put on those potatoes, and camarones (shrimp), which are just impeccable with the seasonings and lemon juice.",

    "text": "I was saving my 100th Yelp review for somewhere special, and Gaucho deserves my triple digit cherry.  You smell Gaucho before you see it, freshly prepared tender meats and chimichurri sauce massage your nose from a block away.    Gaucho means cowboy in spanish, and you will eat a cow worth of the juiciest steak you've ever had in your life.  Everything on the menu is delicious and perfectly walks the line between traditional and inventive.  Very reasonable prices, friendly accommodating staff, a fun, unique style, and generous portions (My steakburger was roughly the size of my head, and yes, I still managed to eat the whole thing).  The only thing they could do better is get bigger and expand for more seating, but since they do discounted take out, I'd be glad to take it home and be a Coucho Gaucho in the comfort of my living room!",

There are no reservations and you are not seated by a hostess but these guys have it down. They serve your food make sure everything is cool and check in on you. If you want additional items they'll place the order for you vs having to stand in line again. Lucky to have in Pgh!",

I was somewhat concerned it was going  to be like the Brazilian and argentine steak houses with massive amounts of meat and prices to match. Oh but how wrong I was. I came in on a Tuesday evening after deciding eating at 9pm reservation was way too late for my five year old. I was overwhelmed by all the meat options and somehow ended up getting a gaucho salad ( don't judge I love meat) after asking the charismatic chef for recommendations . My salad had fancy lettuce, avocado, roasted corn carmelized onions and other stuff . Somehow I missed that it didn't have meat . Boooo my reading skills suck. My guy ordered the rosemary steak sandwich and I tried his . My salad was good but I coveted that steak sandwich like it was salvation or an invisibility cloak. It was so tender and flavorful with great bread. This is definitely a place I'll take friends family when I wanna show them the best Pgh has to offer.",

I can accept waiting outside in the rain because they have nowhere for customers to wait, and I can accept setting my own table once you claim one.   Last night my wife and I made the trip into the city to hit one of our goto places, we arrived at 8:35 to a pretty short line, great right!  Nope, the poor schmuck at the end of the line had the unpleasant job of telling anyone who comes in the he was the end of the line while holding a giant end of line sign.  Really!  it's 8:30 and they  advertise closing at 9.  I found the whole thing just stupid.  Now it's late and we have to find somewhere else to go.   I get this is one of those places who's thing is all about the food that you can't get anywhere else & it grew out of that self serve concept which is kind of cool the first few times.   Now it's annoying.  BTW,our flank steak with chimichurri with red beans and farofa recipe is pretty awesome... Look out! haha.",

It is 5 cuts of beef (filet mignon, skirt, NY strip, flank and ribeye) cooked to your desired temp. We also ordered the Papas Cuna, which is potato salad, and an order of the mixed vegetables. The food was amazing. This was by far our favorite restaurant that we ate at while in town. Highly recommend going here. Note: they don't serve alcohol, so bring your own wine or beer with you.",

There is nothing on the menu that I've tried that hasn't been fabulous.  Finally tried the burger here and it is so good you will want to go to every burger place you have ever been to and demand an apology.   I used to think burgatory was the benchmark but Gauchos has elevated the burger game to new heights.  It's almost unfair to the rest.",

We ordered a few sides and the Ribeye Vaca (large). We were assured it came salad as stated on the menu. When we got back to our hotel we noticed it was clearly absent and weren't about to walk back to the store for a salad.  The relatively small steak and toast were not worth the price paid.  Last time we went, in their old facility, it was one of the best meals I have had.  Sad.",

    "text": "I regret not trying this place sooner. Just the smell when you first walk in is intoxicating. Just as a warning there is not much seating area so I would recommend going for take out or go during an off time.    I ordered the hanger steak which came with a salad and toast and some sort of sauteed onions. This dish was very, very flavorful and looked as amazing as it tasted. I usually take a picture of every dis I order, however, I was too hungry and the smell was just too good for me to waste any time taking a picture. It is basically medium rare though so if you are not into that then maybe try something else or ask for it to be cooked more. It was certainly an adventure for me because I am more of a medium person and like seeing pink not red. My friend ordered the Carne sandwich with rib-eye and man it was bigger than I thought it would be. It. Was. Incredible! I would for sure recommend this dish to try first. There are also 4 sauces to choose from on a table and since I am a big fan of sauce and it was my first time I decided to try them all as a dip to the sandwich and toast that came with the hanger steak. They all add even more depth and tastiness to the food. Either way the flavors are there.   Lastly, The service was great and comforting. I don't know if it was the manager or the owner of the place that asked how the flavors were and made sure we were happy with our dishes, but it was a great surprise to see someone care so much for the outcome of everyone's food. Basically just go and go now!",

Probably one of the best restaurants in the city- I brought an out-of-town friend here a few months ago and when he came back recently, he specifically requested dinner here again.  I did the regular menu for my first one or or two visits, but last week a group of us were offered the chance to skip the line and do the prix fixe menu downstairs in their private events room.  Great decision- definitely more expensive, but fun for a change.  The servers were really knowledgeable and personable and seemed concerned with us having a good experience. I'll be back.",

I read the previous reviews and it said that this place gets busy, I called ahead and they said it was a hour half wait. I went because people swear by this place. And the line was wrapped onto the street and it was pretty cold. I ended up waiting for about an hour half like she said. I ended up ordering the carne sandwich with rib eye medium rare with the peppers and caramelized onions. I gotta say it was a 7/10? It was good and it had this bomb red sauce on the side you could pair it with. They gave a generous portion, I couldn't even finish it. But the steak was cooked good, it was hard for me to cut my knife into the bread of the sandwich but overall it was okay, the hot cocoa bread pudding was a little of a let down. 6.5/10? I love bread pudding but this didn't blow me away whatsoever. But overall I wasn't completely disappointed with the place. Staff there is super nice. And it's tight on seating too. I don't know if I'd be back but I didn't think it was worth that long wait,  I give this place a 7/10 overall.",

As a patron, I would not want to take on the stress of turning down other customers and dealing with their complaints. No way. That is management's job. Very unprofessional of this establishment.   While I was talking with my partner debating what to do, a staff member locked the door at 8:30pm. Again, this place is supposed to close at 9pm. We were then told that they were no longer taking dine-in or carryout orders. Not sure if this is a Pittsburgh thing, but in every city that I have lived in, I have never seen an establishment lock their doors before closing time. Very unprofessional.

    "text": "There's two people Pittsburgh that I truly trust when it comes to food, and Gaucho was the first restaurant that both of them mentioned as a must-visit for me.  And they were right.  Whether you're getting a sandwich, a salad, or a plate, be prepared for charred meaty goodness, and absolutely gigantic flavors.  A few reasons I knew I was going to like Gaucho BEFORE I even got my food:  1. There was a gang of grandmas on bikes leaving when we walked in. I've  never seen a gang of grandmas on bikes before, so as far as I know these grandmas only eat at Gaucho. Which seems like a strong endorsement.  2. The nice young woman behind the counter was wearing a necklace/scarf made of receipt paper, and making it look good. Basically, everyone that works here seems like they enjoy their job, which is always a good sign.  3. The menu is full of all the things I want in my life.  A few reasons I really, really loved Gaucho AFTER I got my food.  1. The Carne Sandwich. This comes with your choice of steak; I went ribeye, which was a juicy, fatty, perfect medium rare, sliced up and slapped onto that amazing bread with char-grilled peppers. If they put more chimichurri on it, it would've been perfect. Luckily, they have jars of chimichurri* available. I put more on, and it was perfect.  2. The Paletilla de Cordero. This is a roasted lamb shank with root vegetables in a phenomenal gravy, over grits, with a charred piece of bread to top it off. It is impossible to decide whether this dish was more beautiful or delicious, because it was so beautiful, and so delicious.  3. The Gaucho Salad. This fresh and colorful salad is the exact thing to order on top of two disgustingly meaty dishes to make you feel like you didn't beast too hard at lunch. But you did. You really, really did.  4. The sauces. Yes, the chimichurri is fantastic and I want to slather it on everything. But don't sleep on the other sauces! This joint knows flavor, and I would gladly drink the ajo, the pimenton, and of course, the always enigmatic quiquirimichi.  In case you didn't realize, my list of things I love after I got my food was all of my food. Because all the food here is delicious. Don't miss it. ____________  *It turns out chimichurri is autocorrected to 'chino hurry.' Which is racist, Apple. But chinos and everyone else should probably hurry to Gaucho before they run out of meat. (I don't think they ever run out of meat.)",

    "text": "Expertly executed beef with deep maillard crust, fresh beef flavor, exquisite sauces, and big soft garlicky bread. Executed in the Argentinian \"Gaucho\" tradition.   Expect to wait in line for this meal. It's well worth it. I ordered the Carne Sandwich with the Ribeye option. The Ribeye was perfectly tender, cooked exactly to my medium rare preference. The crust was salty, deeply savoury, and slightly reminiscent of green aromatics. This is some of the best beef I've ever had. It is unquestionably worth the price just for this beef.   The sandwich comes on a buttery type of foccacia slathered in garlic sauce. The bread is soft and chewy. It's quite excellent. However, I found it to hide the flavors of the ribeye too much. So I pulled apart the sandwich and ate it in pieces.   The sandwich is topped with carmelized onions and red peppers which balanced the sandwich's flavor profile with sweet and acidic notes.   I tried the Ajo and chimi sauces. I found the chimi sauce to be a bit too \"green\" for the ribeye. I much preferred to dip into the Ajo (Garlic).   Gaucho is clearly an iconic part of the contemporary moderately-priced Pittsburgh food landscape. The attention to detail and respect for natural flavors is executed at a world-class level. If you come to Pittsburgh and like food, skip all the carby sandwiches and come first to Gaucho.",

If you can, get to Gaucho early because it gets very crowded and you will have to wait in a line out the door and around the corner!  The staff has the whole line, ordering, seating thing down to a science, so while it may take a little while, they are very efficient at getting everyone in as fast as they can.  I'm not that much of a steak eater, so I ordered the steak burger which was $12 and enormous, it was a little dry, but the sauces at Gaucho are delicious and were the perfect topper to the burger.  Other members of my group ordered the Asado platter which is 5 different cuts of steak and served with toast.  They loved being able to try the different types of steak and enjoyed them all!  The side dishes here are just as good as the main dishes, we tried the beans n greens and the papas al horno and I could not get enough of either.  Gaucho has so much good food and it is really reasonably priced.  This will continue to be a place to share with others and to come for a great meal!",

The food makes up for the weird way you order and get seated but for food that good, I'd swim across the Allegheny in January if they asked.  If you love meat this place will give you the good type of meat sweats.  Definitely will be going there more often.",

We waited about a hour and finally got up to order. We ordered the meat platter with all 5 types of steak. Our favorite part about trying the meats is to see which we like the best, and to compare. It was a little disappointing when the food finally came out, they had forgot to label each meat. The waiter that delivered it also didn't know which was which....so we just ate a big pile of meat lol. Made it a little fun trying to guess what each cut was.  The food was EXCELLENT though regardless of not knowing what we were exactly eating. Will be returning again!",

You can smell the wood fired cooking from down the block in the Strip..... and usually see the line forming to get food atleast 30 minutes prior to them opening.  I usually get the Braised Beef Sandwich with Horseradish when I eat here and honestly, it is fantastic. They have a selection of 3-4 condiments for you to apply to your food that are all amazing.... from hot pepper to chimichurri sauce!  Just make sure you get there early, and be ready to jump on a table when it opens bc the restaurant is too small for the amount of business that pushes through on a daily basis.   Stay open minded and give them a shot!",

    "text": "What can I say, Gaucho is amazing. You're going to have to wait in line, but that's a given and it's well worth it! My best suggestion is to go at an \"off\" time, for both of my Gaucho experiences I've arrived around 2 or 3 in the afternoon and the line is pretty manageable.   You can't go wrong with the steak plates, which come in small (6 oz) or large (12 oz). They come with a Gaucho salad and bread. The steak sandwich is also amazing if you're in the mood for a sandwich. You can pile the sandwich up with just about any topping you'd like. Additionally, they do different empanadas daily; we tried the chicken and they were pretty yummy.   After getting seated and while waiting for your food, load up on all of the sauces. They're all delicious in their own way, but the chimi is my go-to. By the time you have your sauces, your food will arrive. It's crazy fast, which is great after waiting in a long line of anticipation.   The only thing I noticed is their meat is a bit under cooked. I always order a medium steak, but at Gaucho I would go with a medium-well just to make sure the meat isn't too red.   Another win for Gaucho is their food truck Asado which can be found at popular breweries in the area throughout the week.",

This takes away from the restaurant feel but also gives you the privacy of not being bothered during your meal. The drawback here is that you can't really add to your order if you under ordered. This can be remedied by over ordering which is encouraged because as I mentioned before, there are NO flaws in the menu.   Fish, good. Shrimp great. Everything cooked to perfection. That being said, I'd recommend getting it a little bit more towards the medium/ medium rare side then the rare side...because they will serve it RARE...like raw. Even so, it is delectably delightful meat and all the sides and sauces compliment well and are all more than reasonably priced. BYOB only makes this the best place to bring a date.   It's only a little bit upsetting that I wanted more but waiting in the line for potatoes or more vegetables was just not worth it and you can't just cut everyone and add to your meal or ask your waiter. So order everything.",

I tried it for the first time a few weeks ago, and I took crazy pictures and sent it to all my friends. I told them they had to visit just for the sandwich alone!  The steak sandwich is truly their best thing. It's grilled and seasoned perfectly! Although they have a sauce station, it really isn't necessary. The broiche bun is also chewy, and it doesn't get soggy. The papas (potatoes) are done well, and the grilled corn- a must as well.  I loved, loved it. I've had similar offerings in other major cities, and this is one of best sandwiches I've tried. Who knew that Pittsburgh had the best Argentinian steak sandwich?  Oh yeah, BYOB with no corking fee.

    "text": "This is an experience I would recommend. It's a tiny, tiny, TINY place at the edge of the Strip toward downtown. There are maybe 8 seats in the entire place, and at popular times, there are people lined up out the door. The reason they're all lined up is that the food is quite good. We had a rosemary braised beef sandwich and a gaucho salad. Both were quite good. The former was well seasoned and balanced by some cheese and grilled onion. The latter was a collection of a variety of veggies.   The food isn't too cheap, but the quality is very high.",

Extremely unecessary, but i am unbelievably greatful. I got a strip steak sandwich to go so I didnt get to experience sitting down, but next time that will be happening. The crew members joked around with me and all seemed extremely pleasant. From a service standpoint definently a 10 out of 5. Lets get to the sandwich.... the bread. So fresh so delicious just absolutely incredible. The steak? Cooked perfectly and again, delicious. The peppers and onions? They had some sort of sweet glaze or sauce with it, which blended perfectly. Oh my goodness. To say it was amazing is such a huge understatement! Im a big eater and the sandwich was enough to make me feel content (trust me.... it took all my effort to not gorge myself to death of extra food.....). Anyways, please excuse me as i go take a food coma nap.",

    "text": "Seriously? More than a 100 reviews, and an average 5 star rating on Yelp? It's certainly rare to find a restaurant with 5 stars after this number of reviews.  I had to try it to believe it.  Food (9.5/10) = Simply incredible.  The first time I visited Gaucho, I went with the most frequently mentioned Yelp item - the carne (steak) sandwich.  This sandwich is HUGE!  Generous portions of a cut of your choice.  I go for the ribeye, which is a great choice for flavor.  Other components of the sandwich include roasted red bell peppers, onions, chimmi churri sauce.  The bread just absorbs all the juices from the meat and roasted peppers, not letting any flavor go to waste.  If a sandwich is not your thing, there's certainly a variety of other proteins for your choosing, both from the land and sea.  I was surprised and impressed with how absolutely delicious Gaucho's camarones (shrimp) were.  I'm always weary of ordering seafood if I'm not near the coast line, with the concern for freshness.  But goddamn, these shrimps were hella succulent.  Sooo succulent.  Other worthy proteins include the chorizo, chicken, and flank steak.  If you're in the mood for some vegetables, Gaucho's grilled corn, and their mix of asparagus, portabello, onions, peppers, zuchinni, are also great choices.  If you still need more flavor, there are 4 sauces to help enhance the experience:   1) chimmi churri (fresh herbs, garlic, extra virgin olive oil, vinegars), 2) pimenton (charred pepper, garlic, fresh herbs, extra virgin olive oil), 3) ajo (roasted garlic, fresh herbs & extra virgin olive oil), 4) cebolla (carmelized onion, rosemary, thyme, vinegars & extra virgin olive oil)  Service (10/10) = Family owned business are always great.  The two brothers running this joint never fail in making you feel welcome, and are full of energy and enthusiasm for the food they prepare.  Ambiance (8.0/10) = The place is small and cozy, and unfortunately there are only a handful of stools for people to sit on, as they enjoy the greatness of Gaucho.  Overall Opinion = Incredible food.  Awesome service.  What more could you possibly want?  Well, my only annoyance with this place are their business hours and the very limited number of seats for people to chill out and enjoy their food.  I heard they are about to expand, so this will solve the latter issue.  Their business hours were a major influence on why it took me more than half a year after moving to Pittsburgh to finally visit this place.  It would be great if they opened until at least 8 or 9 pm.  It would also be great if they opened on Sundays.  Nevertheless, their business is thriving, and certainly not short on customers.  Like I said in the beginning of this review, Gaucho had an average of 5 stars after 100 reviews.  I now understand why.  It is TRUTH!  Now make your pilgrimage to this fine establishment in the Strip District.",

It's a little like the experience of the first time you dive into Indian food.  The service is also super friendly and helpful.  Very reasonable prices for what you get.  The only thing not to like is the weird order, wait, sit, set up that has to be learned.  It doesn't ruin the experience, but it would be so much more relaxing to be seated and then order.  I hate seat insecurity, it's something that goes back to the high school cafeteria.  You know it's not ideal when there are signs warning you to relax before you enter.  BTW, that's not a problem if you want take-out.",

    "text": "After hearing all of the hype about Gaucho Parrilla, I decided to finally check it out after months of wanting to go. There was a group of six of us that decided to go on a Wednesday evening at 7pm. The line was out the door and down the street when we got there (and it was pretty cold out!) We waited in line for a total of about an hour before we ended up ordering our food and getting a table. The staff was very nice and when we got through the door, they offered to get open our wine for us and get us wine glasses while we waited. Gaucho is BYOB with no corkage fee, which is a huge plus. The six of us brought a total of four bottles of wine to split between us.  I ordered  the large Provoletta as an appetizer. My fiance and I decided to split our meals, so I ordered the large Cordero (lamb) and the large Bire de Chorizo (NY strip) for us. Both were cooked perfectly! I loved all of the flavors! Make sure to try all of the sauces that they have. They compliment the meal perfectly. I have no complaints at all about Gaucho, and I would highly recommend visiting, even if it includes having to wait outside in the cold in line! Gaucho definitely lived up to all the hype and I will be returning in the future!",

There's also grilled veggies that are yummy for the vegetarians (or health conscious)   There are only 8 seats or so inside, but when we went it wasn't crowded so it wasn't a problem. There's tables outside for the summer.   The owner is a long time restaurateur who finally decided to settle down and cook his family's native cuisine. And I, for one, am appreciative that he did.",

They have a lovely little patio that uses their wood pile as a backdrop. Inside is small but the space is used wisely. It has minimal but special decor. There is a huge overwhelming (read-you will want it all) chalkboard of choices.  At the island in the middle are 4 sauces that pair with all of the food nicely.  I am not sure what they are exactly, but each one was better than last!!  The girl at the register was very helpful and explained what things were and gave a helpful suggestion for a fist timer. I placed my order for the filet mignon, roasted red pepper, caramelized onion on ciabatta with a sauce... The owner/manager brought it out and chatted with me a little about the concept and the space.   He even \"apologized\" in advance for the cravings I would have!  I thought we will see.... He was not lying!! I told my husband the next day I wanted to go again! It is that good!!!   You will be very glad you tried it! I can't wait to go again! I want to try the roasted corn!",

The pulled pork was so juicy and flavorful, the papas were very soft and garlic-y, and the shrimp had that wonderful charcoal slightly burnt taste. For the empanadas we got the chicken and the beef. Beef was alright, but the chicken was good. The dough was a bit dry though. We also shared the nutella crumble (I forget the exact name) but it was nutella bread pudding with a cookie crumble and hazelnuts. Kind of too sweet but really good.

This may sound weird to say about a steakhouse, but the salads and grilled veggies are actually my favorite dishes and some of the best that I've had period. The beet salad and their caramelized onions in particular are great, as you can really taste the wood fired smoke on the onions which pairs well with their sweetness. Trust me you want to get these on your sandwich, salad, meat, pretty much any dish!

It had chimichurri sauce and was served on ciabatta bread and it was amazing!  It was cooked and seasoned perfectly and was one of the most delicious steaks I've ever had.  We also had the potatoes papas which were perfectly crisped and seasoned to perfection, and the meat empanadas were also delicious.  They also had a number of sauces you could choose to add and we sampled them all, and all were quite delicious.  The staff were also super friendly and attentive, even though this wasn't a full service restaurant (they kept checking on us to make sure we were happy).  They seemed to really pride themselves in their product.  They don't have much seating area inside, but it was warm and cozy.  It was too cold for the outdoor patio but it looked like a beautiful area overlooking the bridge that would be nice to enjoy lunch outside.  Portions are also huge and very affordable given the amount of food and the quality.",

The chanchito is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had anywhere.    Also, there were two burly men who had literally driven from Ohio to eat here, and while they were they were calling their friends telling them to do the same.    Ridiculous?  Yes.  That is, until you've eaten their food...",

So we were greeted with a loud \"HELLO\" from all of the staff. As soon as we told them that it was our first time, they took us through the menu and answered every question. The whole time, everyone was smiling, music was playing in the background, and there was one guy just dancing. The whole vibe made me happy and couldn't help but smile.  Gaucho does meat right. Steaks were juicy, tender, and seasoned perfectly. Seriously, other people should take note: good quality food, good technique, good flavors. I didn't care how messy the sandwiches were. I didn't care that it was wrapped up in paper and not served on a shovel/chalkboard/etc. What I got was honest, fantastic cooking. No fancy stuff to trick you into thinking something tastes good.  I've come back multiple times and each time has never disappointed. The have expanded recently and I haven't had a chance to go. However, the line going down the street speaks to how their passion for food has paid off.",

We had: - New York strip - bone in chicken (breast and thigh... I know what Chef Boyfriend likes) - house made chorizo  - grilled veggies - and ALL the sauces.   My only regret is that we hadn't brought a baller bottle of Argentinean Malbec to wash down all this smoky, meaty goodness. The shop is BYOB and you definitely should!

Our family from San Diego was in town and said they wish they weren't leaving the next day so they could go back.  We ordered the pasta salad with baby peas, each of the empanadas, a charcuterie board, lamb, shrimp, cauliflower, green beans and tostadas and we loved every dish. Our only disappointment was that we got full and could not eat all of it. Every dish we tried was flavorful and amazing enough to stand on its own but even more amazing with the \"salsa\". We tried all the sauces with each dish and were excited about the way every sauce complimented every dish in  the most delicious ways. We each had our favorites.  I ordered a bread pudding to go and was just slightly disappointed as it was not as amazing and over the top delicious as the meal we had. That's ok though. I still give Gaucho a 5 star review!",

Or at least not as good as all the reviews would lead you to believe. I liked the sauces however they offered. The empanadas were not good at all. Skip them, bland and just not worth it. Corn on the cob was good and potatoes were ok. All in all I felt it was expensive for what we received. Soft drinks were a bargain however at $2 with free refills.

The quality to cost ratio is really amazing for the consumer.   Here's what I recommend: Carne Sandwich (Ribeye cooked medium rare). Any two sides (they change seasonally). Empanadas (mix). You won't be sorry!   The food is a 5 stars, the atmosphere is a 4 stars, the seating is a 2 star. So, if you get there any time after 5:15 - get ready to wait. Like . . . Kennywood, Phantom's Revenge on field trip day wait. The wait is long. BUT that makes your dining experience really nice because the main dining room is small and not overcrowded. I still give 5 stars because this food . . . Heavenly.   Tipping is up to your discretion because you pay up front. It's a laid back environment. Great sauces. Everything is amazing.   Go to Gaucho.

My wife and I have tried most of their items on the menu and all of their entrees are great including the steak salads, chicken and fish. Their sides can be hit or miss at times, but a lot of times that's because they experiment with new offerings.  One thing to watch out for is their lines. It's always out the door, but definitely worth the wait. The service is always extremely friendly and it's BYOB.",

    "text": "Gaucho's is a must stop while in the 'Burgh.  Absolutely delicious meats and sides (herbed potatoes and grilled vegetable platter were both awesome).  We had the Asado Platter which at $50 gives you slices of 5 of their different meats.  This was enough meat for our family of 5 when paired with sides and of course a side order of chorizo.  For chorizo, go with the spicy selection which in my book was perfection.  The set up here is you wait on line to order.  On a Thursday night around 6pm we waited about 35 minutes ... Once you order the food comes quickly.  Wait staff helps finds you a table and you help yourselves to sauces, plates and silverware.  Be sure to BYOB and keep in mind I wasn't able to find a liquor store in the immediate area.  Desserts are delicious - the cinnamon bread pudding was exceptional.  Only minuses for us were: 1.  Our waitress dumped our food across the floor when she lost her grip on a serving tray.  This isn't typical and she almost cried which made me feel bad for her.  They apologized up and down and brought a replacement within minutes.  Hey, it happens. 2.  They encourage you to order dessert up front and that they'll hold it for you until your ready ... They dropped it at our table mid-meal so it was starting to cool when we were ready for it.  They need to get this better sorted or simply wait to order it.  Despite these minuses, I still give it a solid 4 stars for what it is... Meaty awesomeness.  Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.",

The meat had a twinge of wood smokiness that was balanced great with caramelized onions, arugula, and chimichurri. (You pick your extras). The sweet potatoes were out of this world and I will now seek to replicate them. The service is something I would liken to a bee hive: organized chaos.  The prices are more than fair.  5 stars.",

The saffron rice was very tasty. It did seem odd that the salad didn't come with anything on top. Was I supposed to dress it?   Even though it's a self serve place, the employees kept coming by and checking in. Felt very welcome and attended to. So the service was great!  The upper room is nicer but the first room is fun too, to see the action at the register.  I was only not impressed with the dessert. The creme brulee with a dollop of butterscotch and a few fruits. Not very good at all, but the other stuff was so mind-blowing, I can see all why all the fuss.   Luckily got there before 7 because the line was out the door for the rest of the evening, even on a terribly rainy day.",

The bread on the sandwiches is delicious, especially when toasted. - The setting is fresh, clean, and un-cluttered. - The service is great.  Everybody is helpful and cheerful.  OPPORTUNITIES: - The entryway and ordering area is too small.  Even a short line goes to the door, so you sometimes can't really walk in. - The chalk-board menu looks nice, but is hard to read quickly.  Confusing or fuzzy menus can create anxiety for some patrons, especially when the line is short and you sort of have to order now.  Overall, this place is great.  If you have not been here, give it a try.",

    "text": "As everyone here has already mentioned, Gaucho is amazing. The wait outside moves fairly quickly and is completely worth every second. Once inside, the atmosphere is fantastic - the staff does a wonderful job of keeping it relaxed, hipster-ish, and low key. They answered all of our questions and eased us into the entire experience. And so suave.  I love that they provide seating but allow the customer to grab their own place settings, glasses and sauces. No cork fee! And the sauces are all delicious (and not spicy!!). The music is amazing too, like old school, early 2000s hip hop.  Waiting for our food, all we could do was stare at everyone else's dinners with longing eyes. Totally acceptable behavior at Gaucho, btw. I did the Rosemary braised sandwich and it was magnificent. And we split three empanadas. Next time, and there will definitely be a next time, I'm definitely going for the grilled corn and an open faced cut that includes a tostado and a side salad. Because I almost attacked my friend's plate for it. The veggies will help break up all the meat and bread.  I don't really have to mention it, but everyone needs to stop by. You absolutely won't regret it. Five stars.",

I don't remember the names of the dishes - the first was a mix of chicken, chorizo and steak. All amazing! The second was the chorizo three ways. Again, perfect. Like always my favorite part was the side dishes. We had the brussel sprouts that were sauteed in bacon and brown sugar. I loved them so much that I've been making this at home ever since! The second was the sweet potatoes topped with marshmallow. This was the highlight of the meal. I think with all the intensely flavored meats and salt you need this sweet and savoury dish to balance the meal. I live for a BYOB- remember to get your own glasses from the side bar and have a drink while waiting for the line to die down!",

The menu was basically if I were able to custom design my favorite 15 things in the world. How could this go wrong???  Ugh. The meat was oh so burnt. I went with the Carne Sandwich, and to be totally honest, it was barely edible. Even my peppers were burnt to a crisp. I should have gone back and asked them to re-make it, but I was in a hurry to get to the Pirates game.  So why 3 stars, and not 1 or 2? Because I try to be fair and not kill a business based on one experience that seems to clearly not be the norm.   If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, this will be my first stop.

    "text": "My boyfriend kept raving to me about this place for sometime and I finally got to go any try it! First of all this is a nice little corner restaurant that is way bigger than it looks upon entering. You order from a menu that's written on a chalk board which can be a bit overwhelming especially if it's your first time there. Took me a while to figure out what everything was but they have awesome staff that was very willing to help you out. After you figure out your menu you order up front, get your drink, and then they seat you. We sat in the back which was a nice open spaced area. The place was busy but not to the point where we had to wait long at all. Also we found out that it is a B.Y.O.B. establishment too!  As for our dinner it was AMAZING! I was surprisingly impressed since all I kept hearing about was \"how good their steak sandwiches are\". Me and my boyfriend got small steak plates. I got the ribeye and he got the NY Strip. They both were to die for. They each come on a long wooden board with an individualized salad for what meat you get. Then along side is a grilled crusted piece of Italian bread. I swear I couldn't get it in my mouth fast enough lol. The ribeye was good but I preferred the NY Strip and it just melted in your mouth. Each meal was just enough and I didn't feel guilty of overeating to much. Also we got a side of Fungos which were pan roasted cremini mushrooms with shallots, rosemary and sherry wine vinegar. Who does like steak and mushrooms right! These were delicious and paired perfectly with our steak.  I absolutely can not wait to get back here to try out other things! The food I watched come out of the kitchen as we were eating looked so good!",

We enjoyed the flank steak, the NY strip and the pig and pickles (various picked veggies with roasted pork and a yummy aoili).    The ear of corn was cooked to perfection and seasoned wonderfully.  The steaks were grilled nicely and full of flavor.  We also tried the grilled wings, which easily could have been the best wings this eater has ever enjoyed.  Oh,  and there sauces..the traditional chimichurri and 3 others....the garlic one was awesome.  You wont be mad or diappointed if you stand in line.  This place does not disappoint.",

Unusual set up-- you wait in line to view the menu, order your drinks at one counter, then order your food at another counter, then they seat you, and they call your name when your food is ready but deliver it to your table.  Steaks were melt-in-your-mouth good!  Highly recommend the Garlic & Rosemary Shrimp too!  Atmosphere was kind of hipster... way too clean to be considered a dive!  Really good dinner choice for my husband, our 1.5 year old daughter, and myself during a short visit to Pittsburgh!",

Everything we had was very good, though the highlight was probably their 4 homemade sauces that you can put on everything - a chimichurri sauce, a carmelized onion sauce, a smoked pepper sauce, and a garlic sauce. They have sandwiches, salads, plates of meat, empanadas, and sides of veggies. I don't think you can really go wrong but I recommend some type of steak and something with bread so that you can dip it in all the sauces.",

    "text": "I hate to be a Debbie Downer with this review, but I believe in being honest and not feeding into the hype because it's trending. I don't really understand the #1 rating for this place.   I'll begin by saying the food is actually pretty good. It is certainly not the best we have ever had, but it was decent if you are a meat lover. They offer a variety of options located on the chalk board at the entrance of the restaurant. No menus. (At least we were never offered any) Don't worry, you will have PLENTY of time to look at it as you will likely stand in line for a LONG time waiting to place your order at the counter. (More on that to come.  We, the party of 2, ordered the following:  Mixed Grill which consisted of a presentable offering of chorizo sausage, chicken and sirloin. No sides. The sausage was the best, the chicken was very juicy and tender, the steak was just ok, but a bit chewy.  Ribeye grill which included a small salad on the plate which was tasty. The ribeye was pretty good too.   Since there are no real sides offered with either meal, we selected the corn pudding to share. It was also prepared well, but I thought could have used a bit more seasoning.  We ordered water with lemon.  Overall, the food was tasty, but the next segment of this review is what left a bad taste in my mouth. (\"Wah - Wah\" - enter Debbie Downer)  Here is where I take issue with this place. There is a complete lack of structure for their patrons to place orders and be seated. We spent more time in line waiting to get in the place than actually consuming our meal! It is set up like waiting at an extremely busy high priced fast food joint with better quality food. Hey, if you are into these trendy BYOB places and don't mind spending more time in line while you watch empty tables calling your name while you stand in line forever, go for it.  Seriously, when we were finally seated, we watched several tables that were never occupied whilie dozens of folks continued to stand in line to order and wrap around the sidewalk outside. In my opinion, the message here is that the CUSTOMER's time is clearly the last thing on their mind. I will certainly keep that in my mind if and when we would ever consider going here again. Sadly, I doubt we will.  I enjoy good food, but not at the expense of my time waiting in a long line and inflated prices. Just my 2 cents, or in this case $50 for dinner and no drinks, only water. I would give the food an 8; but the long and nonsensical system to be seated gets a 2. Sadly, I would give this place a final overall rating 5 just because of how frustrating the ordering process is set up. However, to end on a positive note, the servers were all friendly and laid back. But as I stated, I doubt we would go back. \"Wah - Wah\"",

Do not come at 9, because they lock the doors around 8:45.   I had ordered the chicken wings and a small lamb chops. The wings were amazing and will definitely be back for them. They were marinated very well and had a great tangy flavor. It was five whole wings so it was good to split. The wings were so flavorful I didn't need to use any of the extra sauces.   The lamb chops were also cooked well with a mustard seed dressing. The salad and tostado was a nice break from all the meat. My friend got the chicken and said it was fine but not great--a little dry. She preferred the wings over the chicken platter.   Overall, I know I will be coming back. Simple food with great flavor!",

Despite being early, we did have to wait in line to put in order.   I ordered the vegetale sandwich, which has grilled asparagus, grilled onions, roasted red peppers, roasted potatoes, as well as mushrooms served on a ciabatta bun. Along with the sandwich, I got a veggie empanada which was nice and fluffy on the outside and the filling on the inside, was spiced just right. Both of these options paired wonderfully with Gaucho's 4 homemade sauce. These sauces really took the flavor to the next level. For dessert, I got the alfajores. I expected them to be hard on the outside, soft on the inside, but the cookie was delicate and melted in your mouth. It was exquisite.    Gaucho is a great option to get some quality food is Pittsburgh. It is definitely on the pricer side, but you won't leave unsatisfied.",

So many positive things about Guacho's:  1. The super friendly service from all the staff. We probably spoke with 4 or 5 different staff members throughout our time there, and they were all so friendly! We were afraid that we might be forgotten because we were the obly ones sitting outside, but in fact it seemed almost as if we were getting very personalized service!  2. They are dog friendly! Seriously, major + for that! We had to sit outside but it's all shaded and even on this 85 degree day, it was very comfortable. 3. Finally, the food, drooooool! For 4 for us (pup included), we ordered the asado platter (5 different types of meat @ 25 oz and 3 pieces of their delicious bread), the argentino salad and the mussles/clams. My husband is very particular about food, especially his meats, and he absolutely loved it. My mom and I loved the salad, it had super fresh ingredients ans the grilled vegetables in it were so tasty!   The only downfall would be the wait, as it always seems as if there is one. But it was well worth it! We went around 4:20 pm hoping to beat the dinner rush. Waited around 25 minutes to get to the front of the line and then another 20 minutes for our food.   We're unfortunately not locals but would definitely go out of our way for another visit to Guacho's!",

When we were seated we realized there were tons of empty tables and that the congestion was at the ordering register rather than the lack of tables available.   I ordered the carne sandwich with the lomo steak. The bread, peppers and onions on the sandwich were wonderful. I thought the steak was good but a lot of it was too charred for my taste.   My husband got the chorizos - one spicy and one sweet. He really enjoyed it. He also got a pork empanada which was fresh and yummy. I tried a bit of his sweet chorizo. I am not a sausage person but the flavors were great.   I definitely recommend ordering a side of tostada so you can dip the bread in the sauces. There were four sauces at the sauce bar - cebolla, chimmi, ajo and a red pepper sauce. My favorite was the ajo which was garlicky. My husband liked the chimmi sauce which was oily and cilantroy and also good.",

I wish I had the chance to try more from their menu. The new restaurant is very nice. The decor gives the right ambiance for the type of food they are serving. Would recommend this to anyone who's visiting Pittsburgh.",

For sides I had the gaucho potatoes and the maiz (corn on the cob) and they were both really good. To my surprise though, the prices seemed a bit much for Pittsburgh, coming from San Francisco, I'm used to paying a bit more for things, and this was comparable to the prices we see out in SF. Besides that though, the place had a good vibe, it appeared to be pretty popular and I'm glad I found it for when I come back next time!",

I knew the cupboards were bare at home, and I wanted to bring the hubs something savory. Serious thanks to the nice young man at the counter - I told him I wanted \"steak and potatoes\" and he helped me translate that into a great to-go order. I got the rib eye, but - per his suggestion - kept it rare. It reheated perfectly to a nice medium rare. The small red potatoes came with garlic and herbs. Delicious! And, there was a nice side salad (radishes, carrots, tomatoes) which I ate the next day. Seriously good food and a big shout out for being so nice to me about my initially non-special order.",

Well worth the weekend 45+ minute lunchtime wait, but Gaucho can also be the source of overwhelming joy when you find (as I did) an empty sitting room awaiting you and a buddy on an overcast pre-summer weekday in the 'Burgh. The rosemary braised beef sandwich is absolutely out of this world. If you are a horseradish fan as I am (read: this classy lady will take some horsey sauce with her fried zucchini at your average nondescript yinzer suburban strip mall pizza joint, yes please and thank you ma'am), you will love this sandwich, but the star of the show is most definitely the melt-in-your-mouth beef. The sandwich is big enough for leftovers, but you might find yourself going in for that second half whether you're still hungry or not. Would also highly recommend checking out the sides (which I believe are seasonal), especially if you're with a friend--on another visit in sunny summer, we split a corn salad of sorts which was as fresh as can be. Absolutely love me some Gaucho!",

Seeing that Gaucho had opened excited me, and it exceeded the lofty expectations I had. Upon entering, it was very obvious that Anthony was excited about what he was cooking and wanted to share it with us. The menu is vast, with salads, sandwiches, small plates, and entrees to fit any time of day or budget. I had the papas (potatoes), flank steak, and empanadas. All were cooked to perfection, and the ingredients were fresh.   It's a great place for lunch, and they have tables you are able to stand at in the restaurant. They are working on outdoor seating for when the weather improves, and it's going to be quite exciting.  All the food is cooked over wood fire on the parilla, thus making all the flavors immense and very complex. The owner and staff are very knowledgeable and have really built a great place in Pittsburgh.",

We love the asado plate, the filet Mignon sandwich, the sauces, the spicy seafood soup, and all of the sides. Their empanadas are not my favorite, they're too dry and the meat is ground too much. I'm excited to try their paella! All in all, this is an awesome restaurant with amazing and fresh food.",

A friend and I split sides of papas and some kind of corn dish, which complimented our meals well.  There are several sauces (self serve) which you can add to your meal.

That sauce that's so talked about (chimi) is worthy of taking a bottle home for dipping on garlic bread and putting it on just about everything!  But that's where the good time stopped for us.  I'm not one to put down a place just because the wait time is crazy long as long as the wait is worth it...but this just didn't ever feel worth it to us.  The restaurant was so loud I could barely speak to my boyfriend. Everyone is kinda crammed together but there's no real \"friendly\" atmosphere here. It's very disjointed and chaotic. We got there on what seemed like a rather \"slow\" night and still waited a good hour to order and sit. Like I said, the food was just MEH...(those beef empanandas I would have totally taken 12 of those home with me and been content, though...with the chimi sauce).  I had the pork, boyfriend had the steak burger. The bread was burnt to almost unrecognizable consistency and I've honestly had pork just as good, if not better in other places. If I were you, I'd skip the hype, stop waiting outside for hours in all kinds of weather, and go find another of the million great places to eat in Pittsburgh.",

My mom and I came here for lunch at the end of the rush hour, so we chose to order a bunch of things (since we figured it wouldn't take very long) and take leftovers home. Each of us got small El Gaucho salads with skirt steak, plus the Provoletta app, a 2 pc sweet and hot chorizo app, and a side of \"rusted roots.\" The salads were awesome - the veggies were crisp, the flavors meshed well, and the steak was truly amazing. I always order rare steak and this place cooked it perfectly. The quality of the meat was excellent, as well. The Provoletta app was delicious and perfectly melty... however, I took half home and had it for dinner, cold, and the cheese was still a stand-out (even cold). We could barely take more than a few bites of the chorizo app and the rusted roots, but not for lack of trying. The chorizo (I preferred the spicy but the sweet was good too) was juicy and had a great blend of spices. Finally, one of the things that made me want to try this place in the first place was the veggie pictures, and I was not disappointed by the rusted roots. This place proves that you can be \"meat-centered\" but still serve up some amazing veggie dishes. I highly recommend the parsnips but frankly all of the veggies in the mix were excellent. One more note about food - try ALL OF THE HOMEMADE SAUCES. On your veggies, on the toast, on the meat - they are all different and so, so good. The service was great (although again, we came at a slow time). A little on the pricier end, but not horrible - you'd probably end up spending about the same if you went to Panera Bread, and there is no comparison to the quality here. I will definitely be a repeat customer!",

It could easily find myself eating his multiple times a week after a good workout and not have my wallet empty. What more could you ask for??",

They were so distracted by my roommates real ID that they forgot half of our order. They seemed very suspicious of her ID even though it was real and she was with her mother. Then we got four wine glasses at the table, and the woman came over again and asked to see our IDs when I clearly was not drinking. Best part, they asked us to leave immediately after we finished because there was a short line. No one else around us was asked to leave, and there were people who were there longer than us. Good food, but absolutely not acceptable behavior. I work in the restaurant business and that is the first rule, you cannot ask people to leave. I do not recommend.",

    "text": "First thing's first- Gaucho has some of the best food in Pittsburgh. It's ridiculously delicious, which makes it really hard to write a poor review.  Let's talk about their line system. They don't let you make reservations or write your name on a list. You have to stand in a line waiting, not to order, but for a table. I get it. It's their thing, their gimmick; it makes them seem exclusive and peaks people's curiosity. A few months ago I waited in that line for about an hour, and the quality of their food was worth the wait.   HOWEVER, when it is a 90+ degree August day, the line borders on inhumane. They have no Disney World-esque signs to give you an indication of how long the line will be, which keeps people waiting because they think it can't *possibly* be that long. We stood in the baking sun for an hour and a half before even getting into the building, then waited for an extra half hour inside the restaurant. I watched people in line get serious sunburns as we waited. I watched a woman with a handicap struggle to literally stand up as she waited, which really made the whole thing feel borderline ableist. A worker came out with a tray of about ten waters, so at least ten people out of god-knows-how-many were able to hydrate. They have signs that say that you can't hold people's places in line, so there are really no good options. The whole thing was a nightmare this time, and seemed like a lawsuit waiting to happen. I don't care how good their food is, no food is worth that.  Also, I am the most easy going restaurant patron in the world, and would NEVER dream of complaining online when my order gets messed up. But when you wait in the baking sun for an hour and a half and they forget to put in your dessert order, then get it wrong when it finally comes out a half hour later while you watch the staff goof around, it really feels like an extra kick in the shins. I loved Gaucho but I can't imagine ever coming back, or ever suggesting it to anyone, until they figure out a more humane, kind, and handicap-friendly ordering system.",

I asked the girl who took me order what she would recommend for my carne sandwich, and she said the sirloin, which was a little tough. I will get the ribeye next time. My husband had the bondiola and he loved it more than the carne. My only wish was that they didnt serve it on ciabatta bread. We also got the gaucho papas and maiz, which was fine, we'll just be sticking to the meats and sandwiches in the future though, because they are incredibly filling... and I would much prefer not making room for anything else other than my carne sandwich.

I ended up paying this place a visit over the weekend at around 3 pm when the lunch crowds had dissipated and the dinner crowd was yet to show up.   Came here with hubby and the in-laws when they were visiting from GA. Anyway I was initially overwhelmed by their menu but we started with the empanadas and fungos (mushrooms). For mains, my husband had the seafood soup and I had the Argentinian salad with filet.   The empanadas were delicious, and were highly complimented by the various chimichurris they had. Chicken went really great with ajo (garlic sauce)) and the beef went great with the regular chimichurri.   My salad was excellent, it had greens, tomatos, mushrooms, onion, bell peppers, and some other stuff I dont remember along with a perfectly cooked filet. It was beautiful, it was tasty, and it was a great bang for your buck. I will have that again.  As for hubbys soup, it had all sorts of sea monsters: clams, muscles, and calamari in a delicious broth which had a bit of a kick to it.   Alll dishes had impeccable presentation, the whole establishment had an extremely clean feel and the wait staff was very helpful and attentive. I honestly could not ask more.   I can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Gaucho's has an average rating of 5 stars! How can we NOT stop by?  This place is bustling all hours of the day. We drove past Gaucho's multiple times during our stay in Pittsburgh and there was a line out the door every.single.time! Rain or shine. Don't be afraid- the line goes quick! I felt like it went a bit TOO quick cause I was still gaping at the wonderful menu plastered on the chalkboard wall.   Con pan carne (ribeye steak sandwich) $12: AMAZING! I didn't expect too much from a sandwich that simply has steak, chimmi, onion & peppers- but boy did they serve me wrong. The tangy-ness from the chimmi is captured well with the sweet & spiciness of the onion & peppers. Such great harmony! You're probably laughing at my review, but you just don't know. All I can advise is for you to try it!  Arrechera (flank steak combo): Steak plate served with salad & toast. Shoot I didn't even bother with the salad & toast cause the flank had me captivated. It was so juicy & tender! All 5 of gaucho's sauces paired well with the steak and brought out a different charm with each one. I was just a bit upset that the steak came out more medium well than medium rare as requested.  Empanada (2 for $5): The reason why this review is bumped down to a 4. It was probably the most untasty empanada I ever had. There was no big difference between the chicken & beef because they both had the same overpowering bitter taste presumably from one of the veggies they used. The chimmi couldn't even save it.   The interior is beautifully decorated with cute hippy accents around the restaurant. There is limited seating. If you go to the back room, there is a super low table you can eat on. The bench is higher than the table so you're basically crouching down over your food. Keep in mind that you can NOT sit down until you ordered. They highly enforce the \"drinks must be on the table\" rule so someone in your party can't save a spot while you order. Keep that in mind~",

However, to keep in line with the Latin way of dining and improve the overall experience, redesign is needed. Gaucho, in an attempt to reduce costs, with limited space and staffing requires customers wait in line to order food (including dessert) then be seated. The wait is often very long, making it not ideal for the elderly or disabled or those of us that want to sit down with a glass of wine and enjoy a scrumptious meal without standing in line.",

    "text": "I'm going to sound a little insane, but I was stalking this place for a while. I'd heard good things about it from my friend, who described it as \"that godly place in the Strip that has five stars on Yelp.\" Naturally, I was a little curious. I swear, I checked their Facebook page every few days while it was closed for renovations to see when they'd be back up.   Well, as you guess by this review, I finally made it! And it was worth it.   ATMOSPHERE: while I hadn't been to the old one, the new interior is lovely and has many different seating options. Unfortunately, this place can get full quickly, so we were stuck at a table where the setting sun shone directly into our eyes.  SERVICE: amazing!! While we were waiting in line, one of the staff came out and asked if anyone had questions. I asked about one of the sauces on the menu, and he brought out said sauce with a small spoon for me to try it. If you're intimidated by the Spanish on the menu, just ask for help. Also, one of my friends wanted to switch out one of his sides for corn on the cob, and they were totally cool with it.   FOOD: my rosemary braised beef sandwich was delicious! I am a huge fan of crusty bread with big beautiful air pockets, and the meat was cooked to perfection. If you're at this place, it is basically assumed you love meat, so be ready to eat plenty of meat. However, two pieces of bread and all that beef was too much for me to bite at once, so I did an open-face sort of thing and used the other piece of bread to dip in their various sauces. I encourage you to test all the sauces and find your favorite!",

Their menu is loaded with authentic argentine dishes and can suit any taste. The queuing/tanking system is a bit unorthodox but at lunch it didn't really matter.   I had the flank steak meal - it was cooked well and the side salad and veggies were amazing. Make sure you try the chimichurri sauce on your steak and bread.",

    "text": "The renovated and recently reopened Gaucho is bright, airy and spacious, yet retains the warm and welcoming feel of its former, more intimate, dwelling. I've been talking this joint up to my family for months, and my dad and I took advantage of a Saturday morning tour of the Strip to pop into Gaucho at 11, hoping to avoid the scores of shoppers who'll undoubtedly invade the place later in the day.   Gaucho lived up to my bragging, impressing even my culinarily-spoiled pops. I enjoyed the super juicy flank steak sandwich, smothered in roasted red peppers and caramelized onions and soaked in Gaucho's signature Chimichurri. The steak was flavorful and tender and, while undeniably messy, combined with the veggies and bread to create a masterpiece on a bun. We split the spicy chorizo plate which was the perfect way to sample another one of Gaucho's selections. The chorizo was complexly flavorful with a mild heat and an intriguing mixture of spices. My dad raved about the lamb, tender and cooked to rare perfection. We washed down all the meats with Mexican Coke and exited onto a busy Penn Avenue stuffed, content and with plans for our next visit.",

    "text": "The ecstatic reviews do not over hype this place - it is the best steak sandwich I have ever had.   We didn't even know this place existed until we were walking down the street and saw a line out the door. Out of curiosity, we stepped up like sheep to see what treats could attract such a crowd. A line out the door always leaves me worried, but it moved pretty quickly. All in all, we were in line about 30 minutes before ordering, and it was another 10 before we got the food. It was absolutely worth the wait.   We got 2 chicken empanadas and two steak sandwiches, one with flank steak and one with NY strip. I love that you can choose your steak, and they have 6 or 7 to choose from.  The sandwiches come cooked fresh, on soft fresh bread, with delicious caramelized onions and roasted red peppers. The mix of flavors is phenomenal, and the juices from the steak are literally dripping off the sandwiches and getting soaked up by the bread. They also put a chimmi (don't call it chimmichurri) sauce on it that was real tasty and added to the wonderful complexity. There is a decent amount of seating in back, and despite the line, there was plenty of open space. If you're in town, do not skip it.",

    "text": "This was Gaucho Marx's favourite eatery in the damn world. He and I joined the rewards club here but then quit immediately, as we did not want to belong to any club that would accept us as members.  They have different prices for girls and boys. I went with my friends Tom and Tina. Tom paid next to nothing, whereas you should've seen what they were Chargin'-Tina!  What to get: The Steak Sandwich, with the Lomo Steak, and all 4 types of sauces to try. What else: A lot of the customers here are airheads, but they're Buenos Airheads, so it's cool. And: Thanks to my many Yelp friends including Laura and Lisa that forced me to come here. You were absolutely right and it pains me greatly in my nether regions to admit that. Ow. Anything else: The bathroom can get a bit Messi and the radio is always playing \"Like A Prayer\" by Maradona.  In a Parrillal Universe, I would have tried the \"authentic Latin spot\" that every white person I know in Pittsburgh insisted I try, and I would have said, \"authentic my left testicle\" and given it a 3 star review for 2 star food and 1 star hipster services and 0 star prices bumped up to 3 stars because it's locally owned. However, in this Universe, something else entirely happened.  What happened is that the restaurant in Pittsburgh most beloved by Hipsters, the Latin spot most championed by white folk, the trendy \"#1 on Yelp\" option... actually... is... amazing. One of the best sandwiches I've had in my life. Several of the best sauces I've tasted in my life. Authentic as a motherf****er but with a real flair and innovation about it too. Gaucho has it all. I am humbled and delighted to say: it deserves every single one of the plaudits.  So you can cry. Cry as much as you want. But don't cry for Gaucho Parrilla Argentina. The truth is, if they've never served you, all through your wild eating days, your mad overweight existence, then please make this promise: and go the distance. To Gaucho. And try their sandwiches. And sauces. And then we'll talk. If you want. Which you probably shouldn't. Because I really do have the tendency to go the f*** on a bit too much.  The sandwiches and sauces here are on a Parr with the best you've ever had, anywhere. The Rosemary Beef sandwich is good, and worth a try, but it doesn't come close to the steaks.  And make sure you try ALL THE SAUCES. I hate to use caps and I rarely do but that just emphasizes how important it is that you try ALL THE SAUCES. They will give you ALL THE FEELS.  I like that they don't Price Gauch you here. Okay, well they kind of do a little bit, but the portions are large and food is spectacularly delicious, so you probably won't feel as ripped off as you would if it were typical sh** hipster food. Service, also, is wonderful here, both by phone and in person.  Of course it's Argentinian food, not \"Latin\" food and that really helps, because when Hipster crap is sold under the comprehensive all-inclusive Latin banner, it usually isn't Latin at all. Every Latin country has a completely different cuisine, and not only is Argentina's amazing, but it's also really hard to find in the USA. This is the best Argentinian food I have ever had outside South America. Hands down.  No really, hands down. The cops are more likely to shoot you and say your Gaucho sandwich was a gun if you put your hands up like that. Friendly advice.  I don't even like steaks. If I lived in Argentina, I damn well would. That's for sure. Famous story about then-Southampton FC manager Pochettino being given authentic Argentinian steaks flown in from his homeland. That's how good they are. They fly that sh** in across the world. So there's that.  I also like that this place doesn't have any Aires and graces. Well it kind of does because all the pretentious people go here. But for once, they have good taste. Now I don't expect to see them down on Brookline at Las Palmas, getting the Ribeye Taco from the street cart out front (one of the best tacos in the US, and 99% of Pittsburgh has probably never even heard of it, let alone tried it). But let's not cry about what we do not have. Let's cry about what we do have: amazing recognition for an authentic, incredible restaurant that - in normal circumstances - would go completely unnoticed in favour of the fake stuff that usually does well.  Don't just bring your friends here. Bring your Peron-tal units here too.  Not only did Yelp help put Gaucho on the map, but it's inside the top 10 of the \"best 100 places to eat in North America\" according to Yelp. And for a city as un-trendy (despite being amazing) as Pitt, that is quite a feat.  I was going to be all Patriotic (since I'm English) and mention our war with Argentina, but then I realized: I don't actually give a Falk.",

Don't wait until you get here to try and find liquor, as there's no shops in the immediate vicinity. We resorted to East End Brewery for some beers which is around the corner. If you want wine, come prepared!   I was with a group of five, so we decided to split the asado plate: FIVE cuts of steak on one plate with toast and chimichurri. On the side, we ordered a house salad (eat your greens!), smashed sweet potatoes, roasted potatoes, and empanadas. We chose to sit outside and they happily gave us an ice bucket for our beers which was a great touch. After a little bit of a wait, our food starting rolling in...   HOLY MEAT. Be sure to ask for the sauces so you can try them all, but really, the steak can stand alone. I honestly don't know which cut I was eating when, but each was as delicious as the last. The smashed sweet potatoes with vanilla and caraway and sunflower seeds was probably my favorite side, but the salad was actually a refreshing addition. I wish we got more toast to soak up the juices of the steak, but it's probably for the best we didn't. All that food was certainly enough for the five of to roll out full and happy.   Wait in line. Order all the meat. Eat all the meat. Dream about the day you can return.",

We came the next day for lunch and surprisingly the queue was not that long and we got to wait inside the restaurant which was promising. We ordered everything veg in their menu which tasted like little treats for our taste buds. We were excited by the four different house-made dipping sauces which were packed with flavors. They noticed our curiosity and helped us with the details of each one of them. All four sauces were uniquely distinct in their taste and not to be missed during your visit. The garlic one is my least favorite though my friend loved it. I loved the herbs (Chimmi) one the most. Hot pepper and onion ones were equally good for me. We had them with tostado but they can go well with anything on their menu. The sweetness of vegetables came through well in the vegetable empanada. And the sandwich was also good. I would go back anytime for their dipping sauces. But you might want to go back for charge-less BYOB or order their's. They are absolutely awesome in their service and the hype is all what they deserve!!",

    "text": "Definitely my favorite spot in Pittsburgh. Everytime I'm in town this spot is a must stop. This place is very different from your normal restaurant. They are a \"crash the counter\" restaurant meaning that you come in, order & pay first & then you're seated. I love this kind of style because you know the food is going to be amazing & the food here is beyond that. I also love the open kitchen. You can see all the cooks making everything & they use a REAL DEAL Argentinian grill. If you think you're gonna mosey into this place or make a reservation as well you're in for a rude awakening. Make sure you get there earlier than planned because the line is always long. Yes the food is that good. Also don't expect to see beer or wine on their menu because this place doesn't have a liquor license. The True beauty about this place is that it is BYOB!! They also provide wine & beer glasses for you which is awesome. They are one of the only restaurants I've ever been to that serves Yerba Matte, which won my heart lol. The menu changes from season to season I believe so make sure you go in to catch them when they have the rack of lamb it is TO DIE FOR. They also have a little sauce station with different homemade sauces which are excellent. They have a killer chimichurri & garlic sauce for their steaks. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu everything is great but I would definitely recommend their rack of lamb. It's a little over 40 bucks but I promise it's worth every penny. Like I said, it's my favorite place to eat in Pittsburgh & I stop there whenever I can. Check this place out if you ever catch yourself in the Strip District & don't forget.... its BYOB",

    "text": "The food here is awesome. It is a very unique vibe. It brought me back to my days spent at the Beehive. It is an interesting setup. You go to the front counter and order your food and pay. Then, you go to your seat and they bring your food to your table. We had the mixta, which comes with steak, chicken and your choice of sweet or hot chorizo. We got the sweet. We also got an order of provoletta and pork empanadas. We got sides of yams, mushrooms and greens and beans. I did not eat the yams, so I won't comment on those, though my wife did love them. The mushrooms were fine, nothing spectacular. The greens and beans were very good, if you like garlic, which I do. The steak was great with a really nice char on it, which gave it a really nice and smoky flavor. The chicken was good, a little bland. But let me just talk a bit about the chorizo. I love good chorizo. This was among the best chorizo I have ever had. It was packed with flavor. The provoletta was awesome and I wish we had gotten a large versus a small. The empanadas were good, if not a little dry, which is fine. There is a self service bar to get dipping sauces. They are all great. It just depends on what you like. We got the bread pudding for dessert, which was incredible.  The only thing that dings it for me is that if you want dessert, you have to rely on one of the waitstaff to get the dessert for you, which they will do. In which case you have to pay separately for that. My wife did make a good point that because they bring out all the food at the same time it does start to get cold, especially since the serve them on wooden plates, which is very pleasing, but it doesn't help retain heat. But once you are done, you can just leave and you are not waiting for your check.",

We were told that the line often wraps around the building.  Not knowing what Argentinian food entailed, we went in, read the giant chalkboard menu...and we were hooked.  Tried the pollo sandwich and the rosemary beef sandwich as well as shareable sides...carrots with hot honey and goat cheese...roasted red potatoes and corn roasted in olive oil.  Portions were huge...prices were low.  This is a bring your own alcohol restaurant if you choose to imbibe.  You order and pay at the counter, then given a table (may be shared) and then served.  While ordering the kitchen is in plain view...I observed everyone sharing space and humming like a well oiled machine.  Everything we ordered was delicious...our entrees came on very dense bread which we discarded but could have been ordered deconstructed.  Overall this was indeed a restaurant we shall revisit and would highly recommend.  Noted that weekend lines can be long!  We got lucky!  Go!",

    "text": "1,549 reviews with an average rating of 4.5. Does this place really need another bangin' review? DUH! Lol. I need a story to go with all the cool pictures I want to post! In town on business and I wanted a unique place to eat so I do what I normally do. I find out what the most reviewed place is in the area and go there! Here I am, 45 minutes before they closed and there was a line out the door a little up the block. Fun Fact: Before closing someone will come outside to assess the line. They will then hand the last person a medium-sized board with a Johnny Bravo picture on it that says \"End of the Line\". With this great power comes great responsibility. It's their job to turn everyone who tries to get in line, away. You get a free t-shirt out the deal. It was hilarious and I had never seen anything like it before. The funny part is, people actually respected the sign, being held by an ordinary customer whom they've never met before. People CAN be kinda awesome.  Atmosphere/Appearance: Set right on the corner of Penn Ave and the David McCullough Bridge is this place. Apartments above it and a very simple concept. Walk up to the counter, order your food then you go sit down and wait for it to come to you. The menu is GIGANTIC in size and posted as soon as you walk in the door. You can see it for pretty much down the street. Lol. High ceilings, bright woods and a few plants decorate the inside. There are 2 main eating areas. One in the front right by the menu and the second is up some stairs toward the back. As busy as it was, it wasn't very loud. Just the sound of normal conversation.  Service: Like I mentioned earlier there isn't much service. You order and it gets brought to you. Cuts out the need for a tip right? Lol. Everyone was very friendly though and super helpful explaining the things on the menu if you struggle with ordering.  Food: I wanted to try several things since I can't remember what Argentinian food may taste like. I ordered all of these at once and here they are in no particular order. The Qui Qui Chicky is \"two chicken legs and two thighs with ancient alien quiquirimichi sauce from outer space and grilled lemons.\" It was phenomenal. I don't think I've ever had grilled chicken that was so tasty, so seasoned and so... awesome! Chorizos were next up. They're hefty sausages. You can get them in a sweet or spicy variety. The come with grilled red peppers, caramelized onions, toast and pimenton sauce. They come in orders of 1, 2 or 3. These were also incredible. Like, can this place just not disappoint?! Moving on. I also ordered the Camarones which are cast iron seared shrimp with rosemary, garlic and lemon. They come in a small and large portion. I wound up with the small since I was trying a variety of other things, but they were quite good. Shrimp can be hard to season. I probably would stray away from these in the future, but give them a try. I needed my vegetables so I tried the roasted cauliflower which comes with chili oil, scallions and lemon juice. Delightful. Light, flavorful and you don't feel bad eating a lot of it. Lol. Last, but not least was their Maiz. it's basically street corn that's grilled with olive oil, salt and pepper! The food was all incredible. I want to try everything on their menu, but my eye is set on that quintuplet of steaks next time!  Value: Not too bad, but can get spend-y if you wanna try multiple things. Maiz = $3.00 Roasted Cauliflower = $4.20 Camarones = Small/$11.00 Large/$19.00 Chorizos = 1/$5.00 2/$9.00 3/$13.00 Qui Qui Chicky = $11.00  This place was freaking awesome. I was able to dine with 2 gentleman I randomly met in line so we all shared a table, not food. Lol. I'd love to come back here time and time again to explore the rest of the menu.",

Many Yelp reviews mention the option to call in an order to take out so I was going to try that as our flight arrived after 7pm on a Saturday night and I wasn't sure if we would make it by the time we drove down there and had to wait in line.  However, when I called the restaurant to place my order literally as soon as I got into my rental car, the person who picked up the phone said that THEY DO NOT DO TAKE OUT ORDERS ON SATURDAY NIGHTS as they don't want to cut the people waiting in line.  I guess I can understand that logic, but I haven't seen a Yelp review that mentioned this and there are no mentions of it on their website either.  I was definitely bummed, as I explained that I was visiting from CA and when he said that I should visit again on another day, I told him that I would be out of town by the time they opened again (they are closed on Sun-Mon).  I'm sure the food here is amazing, but just had to let the Yelp world know that at least on Saturdays they better plan their schedule to wait in line instead of hoping for take out as you won't have that option!",

We tried the bife de gaucho (cooked perfectly to medium rare), gaucho salad, empanadas (one of each) and the chorizo. They also had a variety of sauces to try with the food. We didn't think our order would be enough for 4 people, but we were stuffed by the end of the meal. Everything was delicious and we'd definitely love to come back if we're ever in Pittsburgh again!",

    "text": "Actually, I had my reservations because I was worried this place was \"just hype\" ... however, Gaucho's goes beyond just \"meat-ing\" your expectations! For anyone who argues otherwise is mis-\"steak\"-en, trust me.  There tends to be a long line out the door for a reason. The food speaks for itself. For the quality of the meats, prices are very modest. There's no unnecessary \"fluff\" when it comes to Gaucho's. It's authentic, raw (pun unintended) and straightforward. You want well-cooked, nicely seasoned meat? Go to Gaucho's!  [FOOD] I tried the \"Asado Platter\" which features 5 different types of meat (about 4-5 pieces each) cooked medium rare (the only way meat should be cooked) -- delicious! If I were to be more critical, some of the meat was a little overcooked, but this didn't discourage me from eating everything. Needless to say, I didn't really have a reason to complain. The accompanying sauces (which were in cute mason jars) were also great. I personally liked them all. I had a lot of fun pairing certain cuts with different sauces. I wish I had a salad or something acidic to cut through the heartiness of the meats -- but again, this isn't something I'm complaining about (more so me planning my next trip).  [SERVICE] The workers were very chill and friendly. They definitely know how to handle \"hangry\" people professionally.  [ATMOSPHERE] Although I didn't get to see the \"upstairs\" or elevated platform, I enjoyed the \"vibes\" of the place. Everything felt rustic, raw (again, pun unintended) and warm.  Would I go again? Yes, but I'll be sure to go on an empty stomach (portions are very generous, in my opinion).",

The beef sandwich was great, 4/5, but the other ones were 6/5, especially with the different sauces (we tried them all and they were all so good!). Highly, highly recommend. Wish they would open a location in Chicago.... there's nothing like it here!",

It was over an hour wait just to get in the front door.     I was told they would like for us to be seated outside on a patio area next door to their business/building.  They told us it had nothing to do with us having a service dog, however with a line wrapped around the building, nobody else occupying several tables on the patio except for us, it did seem that way.    We specifically asked when putting our order in at the front counter if we should order extra sodas now or if someone would be by to refill our drinks on the patio.  They assured us that someone would be by to check on us and refill drinks.  That didn't happen, nobody checked on us once, while our drinks sat empty.    The food was mediocre.  I didn't think the meat was great quality and was sorta blah in taste.  One of the slices of meat was undercooked for 'medium'.  The potatoes and the corn were just ok.  I wasn't wow'ed and probably wouldn't wait that long to eat here again.",

    "text": "Elevator Review: Long line, but deliciously worth the wait for meat lovers. (Or order takeout!)  Gaucho is fantastic. On our first visit we waited in line for more than 2 hours. And it was worth it.  I had the Cerdo (roasted pork with roasted onions, greens and grilled bread). This was quite possibly the greatest pork I have ever had. Juicy, flavorful and paired perfectly with sides.  My wife had the small strip steak - again perfectly cooked.  We shared roasted vegetables and empanadas - both delicious.  But to me, the real star is the dipping sauces. My wife is obsessed with the chimichurri, while I love the garlic and roasted onion.   Tip 1: Gaucho doesn't serve alcohol, but they don't have corkage fees and encourage you to bring your own. Bring wine (which many people did) or walk down the street to one of the many fine purveyors of alcohol in the Strip District (we went to East End Brewing Company).   Tip 2: If you don't want to wait, just order for carry out. Call early and walk right to the front of the line and take your order home.",

My coworkers and I have ordered from here and it's ridiculous because it's so much food during the middle of the day. But we can't help ourselves.   We've all only have gotten sandwiches and salads. The bread is out of this world! Tasty, soft and crunchy at the same time. How is that possible?! and the meat is literally cooked perfectly. It tastes so good, as well. It tastes exactly like it should.   This is a hard review for me to write because it's hard to explain how great the food here tastes. It's just really high quality and no BS. Definitely will be coming here as much as I can. Please do yourself a favor and visit when you can!",

And it's an ending that will certainly not disappointment.   It's an \"order at the counter\" establishment, which can sometimes lead to a bit of a line-backup that leads you outside of the restaurant doors, but for the most part the line moves quicker than you would expect.   Whether you are sharing a dish (steak platter or paella), or hand-picking some of your personal favorites, you are sure to find something that you will decide you can no longer live without.    I'm a big fan of the pollo con pan, cauliflower side, and the empanadas.   Push the flavor boundaries a bit and experiment with one, or all, of their house side sauces. (The Ajo is my favorite)",

    "text": "Although this is a fun and casual place for dinner with friends, I think the seasoning on the food here is overwhelming. The steaks are also pretty expensive for the amount you get (about 4-5 slices for small, which typically runs me $15).   Their sauces are colorful and interesting, but way too oily. I also don't understand why they would serve the steaks with chimichurri sauce if they think we would also like to try their other sauces. The rub for the meat is also too salty anyway. I wish I could appreciate all the flavors in their sauces, but I think to save on costs they dilute the sauces down with oil. I have tried to reproduce some of their sauces at home and I can guarantee they are more interesting with less oil.   Food also takes awhile to be served, but they are BYOB so drink it up while you wait it out.   Overall, I keep coming back mostly for the cool vibes and decor, but the steaks could be so much more.",

    "text": "Gaucho has made a name for itself in recent years in the Pittsburgh food scene. Drive by later in the week/on the weekend, you'll see a crowd of people wrapped around the outside of the building. Expect a long wait if you go at peak hours. However, I am always impressed with how efficient they are at running the place, they manage their dining room and seating patrons very well. You'll have long forgotten about your wait once you're seated with your food. The menu is very large, always tough what to order! Awesome that their sides make for great share plates, so always fun to get a variety of options for the table. An Argentinian restaurant is obviously heavy on and known for their meat, but expect to be impressed by everything else from their salads, rotating vegetables, sandwiches, etc. I was in last month and inquired about vegan options and was so happy to hear they use oil for ALL of their cooking. So any of the vegetables, breads, salads, etc., can be made vegan or vegetarian. My most recent visit I had the vegetable sandwich and I will say it was WAY too much bread, tough to eat and the fillings got lost. Salads are delicious and fresh, and all their sides are worth trying at some point. Potatoes used to be better years ago they were so crispy and really cooked well, but I wasn't too impressed with them this last time. You must get a sampling of all four of their sauces because each one is super flavorful and unique. A chimmichurri, ajo-garlic, pimento-red pepper, and cebolla-onyinz a caramelized onion sauce, all available for take-out as well. BYOB so come with a group and enjoy good company. Lovely ambiance inside with all the rustic wood.",

Bodega offers a slightly elevated atmosphere with the same flavors of Gaucho...it did not disappoint.   The first course was a cross between chorizo and salami, Serrano ham, chevre, manchego, kalamata and caselveltrano olives.  It was served with grilled bread and chimmichurri.  Then was an heirloom tomato salad with a delicious pork/beef meatball.  Then the entree, grilled steak, corn on the cob, shrimp, more grilled bread and a variety of vegetables.  The Rosemary onions with the steak was out of this world.  They brought out our pineapple cobbler (so ridiculous!) with a candle for my husbands birthday...a very nice touch. We will definitely be making reservations for downstairs in the future!",

The steak was tasty and was cooked properly, and the side salad with grilled vegetables was nice. The shrimp were good but a little on the small side; I was expecting bigger shrimp for the price. Overall, it was good and I like the idea a lot, but the price is high for what you get.",

    "text": "Gaucho is a tiny spot with big, BIG smoky flavor.  Walking in is like being immersed in a forest fire that all of Bambi's delicious friends have failed to escape.  Me and my brother went here for his birthday dinner, and the first thing that struck us, aside from the size and the smoke, is the minimalist staff: one guy on the register, one guy in the kitchen.  But both of them are seriously good at what they do.  The guy up front was warm, funny, and knowledgeable, providing atypically excellent service while the guy in the back works the grill like a friggin artist.  Here's the breakdown of our meal:  We ordered three sandwiches: the skirt steak, the fish of the day (mako shark), and the steak burger.  The skirt steak was cooked astonishingly well.  Generally when SLABS of steak and not those paper thin slices are used in a sandwich, it doesn't eat well, doesn't break apart nicely when you bite into it so the sandwich falls apart or you end up pulling out more meat than you intended.  The steak at Gaucho eats well, and is wonderfully tender.  Our only complaint was that the steak itself was a bit underseasoned and was overpowered by the caramelized onions and red peppers.  The mako shark was also cooked perfectly and seasoned very well, tasting lightly of lemon but still recognizable as shark.  If you've been disappointed by tough or bland shark in the past, I definitely recommend trying Gaucho's take on it.  Finally, the steakburger was the smokiest burger I've had in Pittsburgh, and in terms of sheer carnivorous sublimity ranks up there with the best.  The smoke complimented the flavor of the meat perfectly, giving it depth and nuance that all the toppings in the world could not.  Of course all of these sandwiches were served on delicious bread that held up to the juices dripping out of the proteins.    All in all, these sandwiches are pricy, but they are damn well worth it.  The executions are excellent and the flavors are generally well-balanced.  I'd also recommend trying the four condiments they have available, with my personal favorites being the chimmi and the ajo.  I have to say, existence of this place gives me much hope.  Here is truly good food and good cooking without pretense, striking a balance (and a striking balance) between artistry and accessibility.",

I have been there four times since they reopened and the disorganized approach towards serving customers is laughable.  The skinny blond guy in the baseball cap walks around swigging Yuengling while lecturing customers why they should wait and why it is \"cool\" they have run out of all the popular items. Twice i have witnessed him explaining to customers how wrong they are while holding up a long line, all while holding a beer in his hand.   Meanwhile it is total chaos with one young lady trying to take orders with a long line while two order stations go unmanned because managers are sitting with customers drinking beer or laughing it up in the back of the house, which avtually disrupts the cooks.  I hope these aren't owners but maybe just relatives .... so they can fire these guys and hire people that know the front of the house.  If not, I am confident they will lose the buzz of new restaraunt popularity and be out of business in a year because of the hideous customer experience.",

Seasoning is simple salt and pepper but when combined with the wood flavor, it is phenomenal.  The various chimichurri sauces are good, but unnecessary.  In addition to the beef, Gaucho Parrilla offers excellent grilled vegetables, toast and sandwiches.  The only seating is in the outdoor garden.  There is no indoor seating, only counters to stand at.  Come, enjoy the smells and defiantly the beef!",

We arrived on a Saturday afternoon and the rain held off long enough for us to get our sandwiches and sit outside to eat.  Thank goodness!  They only have about 5 seats inside and a small area outside the restaurant to eat.  The menu is up on the wall, and I wish we had tried some of the small appetizers, bc they looked awesome!  The grilled corn on the cob looked amazing and I was having big time food envy!  But, we only ordered sandwiches, which were more than enough for lunch!  This place is known for their meats, so I am here to let the veggie heads know they can also enjoy a sandwich here as well!  The veggie sandwich is huge, with lots of great slices of different grilled veggies. They also have all the salsas out on the counter so you can try them all!  (Which I did!)  My husband got one of the steak sandwiches and was silent for about 4 minutes while he inhaled it.....which means it was awesome!   My advice is to call ahead with your order and pick it up to go.  That is what we will be doing the next time we go, which will be sooner than later!  It is great, but the seating is a pain!",

The food came promptly and we dug in, only to find all of the meat cold. Not warm, cold as if it had been laying around for an hour. We were starving after having driven 5 hours from Allentown, so we just ate it anyway. It did taste pretty good. We told the busboy about the coldness when he asked, and he offered a free dessert, but as I am diabetic, I said no. So, I would have given this place maybe 3 or 4 stars, but then I got sick. Not food-poisoning level sick, but bloated, gassy, and indigestion all day. A bit nauseous as well. I have a stomach of steel, too. I almost never get sick from food.  Just know that this place isn't all that it is cracked up to be, even the cuts of strip steak had tons of fat and the veggies were unevenly cooked. And, if your food is cold, get your money back and run! We probably just had a fluke of a meal but still...",

I have a feeling that the \"word\" is getting out fast about this place.  Their menu was full of delicious sounding creations it was hard for us to decide.  We asked if they could just put us together some mixed grilled vegetables and meats.  That they did.  We enjoyed a platter of mixed meats with shrimp, a large salad, toasted bread, grilled vegetables and delicious sauces.  Everything was so flavorful and cooked perfectly and their home made sauces went well with everything.  The staff was super friendly and accommodating.  It was nice enough to sit outdoors and we enjoyed the atmosphere and the food.  It is a small place, some may describe as a \"hole in the wall\", but I disagree, it is small but, charming.  Their food is unique and tasty, tasty, tasty and BYOB, well that is just fantastic.  We will be back to try some of their other items.  YUM !!!",

And yes, that line goes outside and around the side of the building, rain or shine or snow and bitter cold. They take debit/credit cards.   Food: We had the lamb, a NY strip steak, and a ribeye. All the meats were prepared to the requested level of doneness. Lamb has a bit too much salt for my liking, but otherwise fresh and flavorful. Good char on all the meat. No one in our party of three cared for the charred bread accompanying the meats. Salads that came with each meat were lightly dressed in a vinaigrette. Empanadas were amazing! The pork empanada was our fave. Sides of cauliflower, broccolini, and green beans were simple and tasty.   Service: You line up and order from the main counter. There is NO TABLE service. Drinks first, then food. Staff are proficient in explaining what's on the menu, which is a massive chalkboard on a wall as you enter. Based on your time in line, you should have plenty of time to review what's on the menu. Specials are posted lower on smaller individual chalkboards near the front of the line.   Cost: A small lamb, 6oz. ribeye, and 6oz. NY strip steak with side salads, 6 pc. shrimp appetizer, sides of cauliflower, green beans, and broccolini, with a pork empanada and a chicken empanada ran us about $85 after tax. Not cheap and portions are so-so.   Overall: I wouldn't line up for it again, but it's worth a try. They do have a sign for the last group to be seated to hold noting they are the end of the line. This is so more folks don't wait in line in case they run out of food.",

Everything was so fresh and you could tell they use high quality ingredients. Steak was tender and cooked to perfection. The caramelized onions and roasted red peppers were the perfect accompaniments in the sandwich. A little heavy on the bread but you can order it breadless or open face. I just took off the top piece and ate it with a knife and fork. It was perfect. Papas were served with rosemary and roasted garlic cloves. What stands out are the 4 sauces that are self serve on the 2nd level - chimichurri, ajo (garlic), cebolla (caramelized onion), and pimenton (smoky red pepper). My favorites were the cebolla and pimenton. Put some on every bite to experience the different flavor combos.  Food came out promptly and service was friendly.  Will definitely stop by again to try more items the next time I'm in town!",

I told my boyfriend that I was actually sad the meal was over (i.e. All the food was gone).  He got the huge steak plate with 5 different cuts of steak. The Ribeye was his favorite.

    "text": "Was the 1hr wait in the cold and additional 1 hr kind wait to order worth it?   I don't know to be honest.   Maybe if you've never had an south american/Argentinian steak over a fire? I guess this place is a gem in terms of food diversity and culture in the area and is accessible by tourists on the strip as well. If I had my way, I'd honestly recommend going there on a less busy time for maybe lunch? We saw lines already starting at 5PM for dinner. Maybe a weekday instead of a weekend?  They make fresh chimichurri which was delicious. We got the NY strip steak large plate each which comes with a side salad and grilled bread which was delicious to dip in the array of sauces.   The steak was perfectly medium rare and they do cut your steak for you if you're not used to that.    We also got the roasted cauliflower as well. I think overall the food was fresh, perfectly grilled, and the ambiance reminds me of a family style modern farm house esq place with an almost cafeteria feel I also loved all the local art support. Be aware that it will be noisy so don't expect your intimidate atmosphere.  It is BYOB as well.   Overall not a bad experience but I honestly don't think it was worth the wait.",

I usually get the flank steak plate and the small 6oz is plenty large for lunch for me. I get the steak medium rear and it is some of the best steak I have had at restaurants. They also have 4 sauces that are really good and I usually use the roasted red pepper sauce on my steak and one of the green ones for the piece of bread they serve the steak plate with. I have also gotten the cheese/prosciutto plate and the meat plate (chicken, chorizo, etc) and they are both really good as well. I have never been disappointed by anything I have ordered at Gaucho and have never heard anyone say anything bad about it.",

I was in Pitt for a conference and made a stop after locating the restaurant on yelp. As I stood in line I watched plate after plate pass by and everything looked good. I had the ribeye plate medium well, off the chain!!!!! I also had the grilled broccoli and the rusted roots potato's....a must. Sweet potatoes, carrots, onions,chopped celery, and I believe chopped red potatoes.  This is a must get as well. You have to get the cookies Coates with coconut, I grabbed two to go and a chicken sandwich to go. This place is off the chain!!! BTW great staff as well....OG is the manager and he will set you straight if you don't know what to order.  My co-worker had the sirloin and roasted potatoes with smoked garlic. And we both order empanadas to go as well. This place gets a yessss mister!",

If that's okay with you then fine, I just did a lot.\"  I did not drink that evening, everyone else took advantage of the BYOB. Someone in my group handed her 60 more dollars. , before I could stop them.  The cash she claimed to \"have left over\" as her tip didn't match with The money she was given. Additionally, she did not include the $32 dollars in off those who paid with a credit card.  I won't be back, it was so uncomfortable. And I feel she was dishonest, whether by mistake in counting wrong or on purpose. In general not okay.   Update- this took place in the downstairs bodega.

    "text": "I just found my new favorite steak place in Pittsburgh! Wood fired, smokey meat at an unreal price not to mention a great BYOB policy.  Needless to say it took a good 75 minutes to be seated on an early Saturday afternoon, but the wait is very much worth it!    I went here with my wife and friends from Buffalo.  The setup of ordering is different than most restaurants as we ordered before being seated.  I ended up getting the steak sandwich (Carne) which was your choice of meat served on a ciabatta bun with optional toppings.  The couple we went with split the steak platter which included a variety of meat to select for a total of 25 oz.  We brought a 12 pack to split between us over dinner so we drank that while waiting for our food.  When the food finally came, all of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals and were absolutely stuffed afterwards.  The meat had an amazing smokey flavor, and in addition to the meat there were 4 amazing sauces to pair with your food.  I would highly recommend trying all 4!    The steak here is extremely impressive! It's hard to beat the smokey flavor and the complimentary sauces.  BYOB is a nice option to have with your meal.  My only disappointment from the meal was not trying any sides or desserts! I even ordered a sandwich to go to eat later.  I will definitely be back here with friends to introduce them to such a great dining experience.",

    "text": "I always got the sandwiches. I never knew what I was missing until I started ordering off of the entree menu. That's not to say that the sandwiches are lesser than, but the entrees are so fantastic it's really hard to pass them up. Yes the large size steak on trees and some of the bigger entrees are a little pricey, but the quality of food and preparation totally justifies the price. I'm not a huge meat eater, but this place offers incredible slices of red meat and the chicken is fantastic.  Totally worth the splurge. The flank steak is to die for, the chicken breast with the garlic sauce all over it is on real. The sides are good, the cauliflower and the broccolini are definitely the best, the potatoes are good but in contrast to the awesome flavors in the meats the potatoes seemed a little lackluster to me. They're supposed to be a sidenote the main show.    I've never ordered the paella, but I've seen it served and it is a ton of food-with lots of yummy things. There's really nothing better than a perfectly cooked cut of meat.  It's worth noting that even though this place definitely is carnivorous, their salads are some of the best in the city with or without meat-and all of their non-meat offerings are done right.",

We went on a weekday around 2 PM and were seated immediately. We had to place the order before we were seated. I think they expanded the place since it can definitely accommodate more than 8 people now. This is my first time trying Argentinian cuisine and I greatly appreciate the help their staff provided while we were ordering. They were patient and answered all my questions and infact made some good suggestions too.  So we ordered shrimp cooked on cast iron and vegetable empanadas. The shrimp is coated with lemon butter sauce and it is tasty as is and the taste enhanced further when we ate it with the garlic sauce. It is cooked and seasoned perfectly. I could not try their shrimp over rice since it is for a large group but I am glad they had this shrimp on their menu which is a decent replacement for shrimp over rice.  The vegetable empandas are herb flavored and have a unique taste. The filling was seasoned perfectly and the dough is cooked well. these tasted great with the roasted pepper sauce.  They also have pomegranate orange drink that goes well with the two items that we ordered.  Overall, it is a great place. Though it is expensive for the quantity, I will go back again for the flavors!",

The staff were very friendly. You order food and drinks (soft drinks only as it's a BYOB) at the counter where you pay and the staff seat you and bring your food out. Our food arrived swiftly once we were seated and I think part of the reason that you wait at the counter is so that the kitchen doesn't get swamped with orders. G.P.A. isn't fine dining - its a casual lunch/dinner option with a friendly, relaxed atmosphere. I was surprised to find that the tables were spacious and well spaced out and I appreciated that they didn't rush us or pressure us to leave even though they were busy. The food was very good, simply prepared and very flavorful. We shared a mixed grill of sausage, chicken and flank steak which came with some grilled country style bread,along with a house salad and two empanadas, this made for a hearty lunch that was satisfying and extremely reasonably priced.  The empanadas had soft tender pastry and tasty fillings, the meats were well cooked and juicy and the house salad made a nice fresh accompaniment (we had a small salad and it was plenty enough for two people). The meats came with chimmichurri and in addition there were large jars of it around the restaurant that you could help yourself to, we tried four different sorts and they were all amazing and complimented everything well.  We only had time for one visit, but I can't wait to visit again on my next Pittsburgh trip!",

    "text": "Gaucho is as good as it gets. The only problem with Gaucho is that it's too popular, and the wait can be ridiculous. I recommend going on a weekday at odd times like 3pm if possible to avoid having to wait at all.   If it your first time at gaucho, I strongly recommend getting the Asado platter. The Asado platter contains 4 pieces each of 5 different types of steak. It's $50, but it has enough food to feed 2-3 people, so not too pricey when you split it. Get it medium rare. Trust me, the way they cook their steak, it's meant to be cooked medium rare. Try the steak by itself and then with their four dipping sauces just to get the whole experience.   Even though they're an Argentinian steak place, their vegetable dishes are amazing. I'm not much of a vegetable person, but every salad or vegetable dish I've gotten there blows me away. If you're with 2-3 friends, I recommend getting the Asado platter and a large salad and another vegetable dish. It comes out to around ~$20-25 per person.   There's no other place more worth it that Gaucho. Nothing in Pittsburgh compares. If you're trying to impress your friends who are visiting, this is the place to take them.",

    "text": "I cannot believe I had not updated my review. This is hands-down one of Pittsburgh's top three restaurants and they earned it. They started in a space the size of their current kitchen, and this was actually the building, and they have since blossomed into a consistent, creative, fun, high-end, but not stuffy headed steak house Argentinian style.   Everything from the salads with meat added option, which is an excellent value for prime cuts, the side dishes, empanadas, sandwiches, and steak plates are fun, rustic, a touch playful, always delicious, and, simply put, exciting and satisfying eats. I don't really need to break it down because you can find something for everyone here and it will be good. Don't discount how good they can do fish or chicken because they can do it very well.  For those that have not been, this is a counter service style restaurant so you cannot save tables or be seated until you have ordered. As part of the success, expect long lines during prime hours particularly power lunches and Friday / weekend dinner. Calling ahead is not always reliable to get your order in but is an option for pickups. The line for the counter can go up to an hour and a half long and on some nights the doors are closed almost two hours before closing time if they are at capacity with a very long line waiting. You will know because end of line will have a wood sign stating they are the last to be admitted.   Don't fret though, it is worth coming back another day because what you'll get is worth the wait and the price... and they are still very fair about all of their prices for what is superior quality and you would be charged almost double in a traditional steakhouse.",

It quickly became crowded (sometimes you'll see lines out the door) but make time for it. We ordered 2 different empanadas to try. They were good but not the highlight. I had the ribeye steak sandwich- so flavorful and tender meat. Husband had the rosemary pork sandwich which was even better- AMAZING! It's an order at the counter, find a seat and your food is delivered to table type of place. You must try the different sauces that they have at the service areas. The only reason this review is 4 instead of 5 stars is that my steak was cooked medium but I asked for medium rare- I really don't enjoy beef cooked above that (but the tenderness and flavor was still there) and the empanadas were just okay but they were enhanced by adding those amazing sauces though!",

    "text": "The Rosemary Braised Beef is every bit as mythic and mighty and marvelous as its now incredible internet hype would have you believe. There's a baguette that holds a generous wad of paper-thin savory, fragrant beef sheets that are cooked slowly for an eternity. Caramelized onion and horseradish sauce are added for the sake of sweetness and punch. That's all there is. It is a Philly Cheesesteak gone rustic and cowboy, the campfire aromas of this small establishment beckoning people from late afternoon to early evening. So yes, GPA does a 4.0 job of making mundane meats taste extraordinary in a confined space and within a quick-serve framework.  I don't seem to be reading much about the desserts, though. I don't recall GPA selling them during my last visit. Regardless, my readers should give them your undivided attention.   The bill of fare lists 3 of which Kay and I tried 2. First at bat were the spectacularly scrumptious Panqueques. A crucifix of slightly scorched crepes, each rolled wafer resembled a tuile cookie in terms of flavor and chewy-brittle mouthfeel. Topping them was merely chocolate syrup, but filling them was a creamy, carnal, somewhat briny caramel that clung to the palate like a desperate lover.   The second sweet treat came in the form of Alfajores. Coming off as a cross between a macaroon and a Fig Newton, the trio of cookies come either with lemon or cinnamon flavors and also contain caramel (La Dorita Dulce de Leche). Soft, sticky, and full of sugary bravado, one could imagine having these with tea in more genteel surroundings instead of the gritty Strip District.   Apparently, Gaucho Parrilla Argentina fits the definition of a runaway sensation while still measuring up to the buzz it has unassumingly created. Who would have guessed they be the kings of Pittsburgh Yelp? 2 years ago on a February night, I was hoping they'd remain a secret gem.   P.S. Outdoor seating is available now. Indoor seating remains very limited. Prepare to opt for take-out.",

All that being said dining at Gaucho is unique. Usually the wait is so long you are standing outside on average for 45 minutes and then an additional 15 minutes inside. The ambience in the front dining room is fine - there is a lot going on around you with the wait staff and the ordering desk right behind you. The back dining room leaves much to be desired (it really does resemble a fast food joint). Last night was our second time dining at Gaucho. The first time I was so blown away by the food I couldn't wait to go back. But after waiting again and lack of atmosphere we might take a break and go back in a year or so when we have friends in town.",

    "text": "Why aren't there more shops like this around?  On the West end of the Strip is this little Argentinian restaurant called Gaucho. It's easy to walk by without taking notice ... but the wood paneling and the amazing grill aromas will draw you in. They even have fresh rosemary growing in the store to use for their marinades and sauces. There is limited bar-style seating along the walls.  The staff is super friendly and inviting. The shop is about two months old, so they're still soliciting feedback on menu items and concepts from customers. I believe they are soon opening up their outdoor seating section as well.  The menu is actually quite big for such a small shop, with everything from sandwiches, to salads, to full entrees available. We decided to go for a Saturday lunch, and it wasn't too crowded inside at all. We asked one of the staff what the most popular items were, and he said the carne sandwiches were the hot item. I went with a ribeye carne sandwich (you can choose from different cuts of steak!), while the rest of the family tried the chorizo and pollo sandwiches.   The carne and chorizo sandwiches are loaded with roasted peppers and onions, while the chicken sandwich is loaded with portobello mushroom and onion. They all sit on ciabatta bread. The meats were all extremely flavorful and generously portioned. The ribeye had an amazing rosemary marinade on it that just elevated the taste experience to another level. While there are four different sauces you can experiment with in the center island (I highly recommend trying them all), the carne sandwich really didn't need any extra flavor at all. So good. The rest of the family thoroughly enjoyed their choices as well. I really wanted to try some of the grilled vegetable items (OK fine, I wanted to try everything on the menu), but I was full already.  This is such a great introduction of Argentinian grill food to the Pittsburgh area, and I can only see Gaucho gaining infamy as THE place for an incredibly authentic bite of Argentina.",

Any time I have guests in from out of town, I make it a point to take them to Gaucho.  My favorite menu item is the Carne sandwich.  You get to choose the cut of steak on your sandwich and there is no upcharge.  I usually end up with a Filet Mignon steak sandwich for $12.  The sides are easily shareable.  Our go-to is always the potatoes, some corn on the cob, and one of their rotating vegetables.  The desserts are also fantastic, although they do rotate.  I usually go with whatever seasonal bread pudding they offer.",

    "text": "Gaucho Parrilla has become one of my favorites in Pittsburgh. It's 7th in the nation on Yelp's list for best restaurants in the US and definitely deserves its place there.   I went with a friend and even though the bus dropped us across the bridge (the stop is right BEFORE the bridge, but he just kept going...) it was totally worth a freezing walk across an icy bridge to get to this place. The person who took our order was super knowledgable about the menu and I can tell they take a lot of care in preparing the food. He even offered to let us stand by the wood-burning stove since we were so cold from our walk over.   We got the Rosemary Braised Beef sandwich and New York steak, as well as a side of potatoes. It was all delicious. I think the sauces they offer really make it awesome.   As many have said, the hours that they hold are a bit inconvenient. (Tues. to Sat. 11:00 AM  to  7:00 PM; Sunday Closed; Monday Closed) There have been many times I wanted to go, but it was already closed. Hopefully they will expand their hours after they renovate! At any rate, if you live in Pittsburgh (and eat meat), you should definitely check this place out.",

Their main thing is steak, but I don't eat steak so I always get a salad, which in many cases would be disappointing, but at Gaucho it's not. It's not disappointing at all. I get the El Gaucho salad, which has avocado and a bunch of grilled vegetables. Today I added grilled shrimp and it was worth the extra $5.   I've also had the vegetable empanadas, grilled corn, and potatoes. I recommend each and everything I've eaten there. And oh my god, all of the sauces. Delicious homemade sauces for you to drown your food in (or just for a little extra flavor. Whatever you want to do).  Each time I've gone to Gaucho new people have come with and no one is ever unhappy. One person I was with said it was \"overly seasoned,\" but I don't like bland food so I am selectively disregarding his opinion.",

    "text": "You don't need to read any of these reviews.  This is the most popular spot in the city (and Yelp's #7 in the country!).  Just make sure you try the sauces.  The garlic (ajo?) one made my meal completely.  This place doesn't need me to tell you to go there, but if you need a review still, a messy one follows.  The +1 and I have tried to come here a couple times in the last year.  The first time, after work last winter, called the place, they said they were almost closing (~6:00) so don't bother. Fine.  Tried to go a few weeks ago while in the Strip on a Saturday. HA!  Unless you are patient and are extremely weather prepared, don't bother.  Lines out the door; we waited for about fifteen minutes and decided waiting in line outside in January is not for us.  But alas, I had a half day of work due to an appointment in Bloomfield.  It was 3 PM, snowing like crazy, maybe four degrees out, and you're damn right I got on that 86 bus and slid down to the Strip District.  The inside is tiiiiiny. Mostly kitchen, a middle table, six stools along the sides of the wall.  I was immediately greeted by Anthony, I think, who was so unbelievably awesome.  Another cook there, younger kid, was drinking all the wine in this BYOB establishment so I knew I liked this place already.  I wanted to take dinner home as the +1 was stuck in meetings all afternoon and couldn't join me, so I needed things that traveled well.  I knew I wanted chicken (pollo! .. which is \"poh-jo\"-ish, not \"po-yo\"; this ain't a Mexican joint!) and was directed to the sandwich which he suggested I get \"deconstructed\":  toast instead of bread, everything piled together, oh my sweet jeebus, you don't even know.  It had mushrooms on it which I do not do.. but I ate them. Me. Picky Queen of the East. I also got the potatoes (papas!) which were roasted to almost a blackened state in the best sense.  Don't forget the sauces for these.  I had a lot of help packing everything into my huge brown bag.  Everything separate and packaged so nicely. They are too sweet here; I can't stress that enough.  I asked for the most popular items for +1.  He received a rosemary beef sandwich and corn.  After he put that thing together and drenched it in the horseradish sauce, it was gone.  I have no idea what happened.  I thought he was going to drink the chimichurri. I'm not a beef eater, but it honestly smelled good enough to potentially turn me against my moral judgments.  The food is some of the best South American-y business I have ever had.  It might even be worth the line outside in January or, at the very least, another half day of work.",

    "text": "Sometimes going to a multi-hundred five-star reviewed restaurant is taking a chance, because how could anything really live up to that sort of expectation?  Well, Gaucho does.  My first encounter with them was at a Yelp Elite event at which they were one of the caterers.  I was really taken with not only the absolute deliciousness of the food, but also the very down-to-earth attitude of its owner.  It took nearly four months since that first encounter  to finally drop in on their tiny (but soon to be expanded) space in the Strip, but it was abso-freaking-loutely worth the wait.  My. God.  I got a small plate of the flank steak, plus I split the cheese toast with my friend.  Another customer who was waiting for a takeout order also made sure I didn't forget to grab one of each kind of sauce, all of which seemed to be variations on chimichurri sauce.  I probably would have found my way to them regardless, but I was glad of the advice.  They made what was an incredible lunch even better.  I couldn't stop dipping both  my bread and meat into them.  I just...I can't even describe how delicious this food was.  The best part was that I still felt really good afterwards.  More than satiated, but not sluggish like one might be after dishes that rely on heavy fat, salt, and/or sugar to get the yum factor.  This was just expertly prepared meat, a delicious salad, and perfectly chewy grilled bread.  Next time (for there WILL be a next time), I'm getting at one of those sandwiches, though!",

My friend and I both ordered the Parilloda Mixta which consists of the chicken, chorizo, and NY Strip. We also ordered a small plate of grilled shrimp, yellow rice and roasted potatoes. My steak was well done and the chicken with the green chimmi sauce made it more flavorful. The sausage was a little salty for me but the next day I finished the rest and weirdly it was perfect. I wish we would've remembered to bring a bottle of wine since its BYOB. There was not as much seating as I would have liked upstairs but we managed to snag a table as a couple got up to leave. The menu was a little confusing at first but I just hopped on yelp and the pictures on here helped us out tremendously. We were both extremely satisfied and we will definitely return. Our meals were worth every penny.",

Unfortunately, I didn't find it :( But this place is MOST DEFINITELY Food Network Feature Worthy!! Does that say how good this place is yet?   Writing this review makes me drool.... All of their sandwiches are amazing (if you are a steak lover, you can choose what kind of steak to use for your sandwiches)! The chicken and the veggies sandwiches are also really tasty! As a meat lover, I still find the veggie sandwich amazing! The salads they offer are equally as good. When I am in the mood to eat slightly healthy, I go for the salad. The sides are also fun/tasty! Just honestly, try all the food on their menu :)  They are currently under renovation. Can't wait for them to come back with their hopefully bigger space!

We went on a Thursday night. The line was not that long, but we still waited about 30 minutes to place our order. The restaurant is BYOB so if you want something to drink make sure you bring a bottle of wine or beer. My husband and I ordered the  large flank steak, the small lamb chops and a side of mushrooms to share.  The flank steak was mediocre. I prefer my husbands over theirs. The flank steak could have been more flavorful.  The side salad and the mushrooms were good but there was nothing outstanding about the sides.  The side salad and mushrooms tasted like any other restaurant.  My husband liked the lamb chops. But said they were average tasting.  The portion size is small. My husband could have easily ate all of the food himself. I was hoping for a really different tasting, flavorful meal but everything we had was average tasting. With that said I would be willing to go back and maybe try one of the sandwiches on the menu.  I think we just maybe did not order the right thing. But the atmosphere is fun and hip and the BYOB would be a good addition if you had to wait in a really long line. #3stars",

The potatoes were super amazing and the sauces added a lot of great flavor. The chicken empanada was awesome, but the beef was only so-so.  My sister and I were not huge fans of the sandwiches. They had a ton of meat, and we both took a lot of it off our sandwiches. I had the Bandiola (pork shoulder) and my sister had the Carne (steak) sandwich. I thought that the flavors of my sandwich were really interesting, but so intense I could only eat about 1/2 of the sandwich. Ditto for my sister.  We also got 1/2 dozen cookies they had in a display case for the road (5 hour trip). Those were AMAZING. So, so, good. I think those change day-to-day, but give their dessert a try!",

Both were delicious (as we're the sides) and the sandwich came on bread that was toasted and perfect for absorbing all the juices. Definitely a must-go for anyone in Pittsburgh!",

The combination of high quality ingredients and wood fire flavor makes every dish on the menu incredible.  If it's your first time at Gaucho, I would recommend trying the carne sandwich with filet (you can have any cut of steak on the sandwich for the same price). I find myself craving this every time I come. But don't be afraid to branch out and try the chicken, pork, fish, and sausage dishes. I have not had one bad dish in the many times I've visited. Even the simplest dishes, like the toast, taste so much better than anything I've had before. Gaucho makes seemingly simple dishes outstanding.  The atmosphere is casual and laid-back, and you will enjoy it much more if you have an easy going attitude. The lines can be long, and you may have to wait a bit for seating. But the staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating. Take advantage of the BYOB policy and enjoy a drink while you wait in line! I promise it is worth it!",

The staff and overall experience were great, but the food just didn't cut it for me.  I visited with a group of four friends and I ordered the pollo sandwich and the vegetable and chicken empanadas. The sandwich was huge, but the flavors weren't very sophisticated and I didn't  really think they worked that great together. Plus the bread plus all the meat made for a pretty dry sandwich. The empanadas were similarly monotonous in flavor, regardless of filling, and the dough outside was oddly hard. My friends found their meals good but not fantastic.  Based on all the great reviews, I was so ready to fall in love with this place... maybe I will give it another chance sometime.",

Well done   Update: So far I've had three of Gaucho's sandwiches: the Bondiola (pork shoulder), carne (I had flank steak), and rosemary braised beef. The Bondiola is my favorite of the lot.

My friend and I each got a sandwich and split them, so I got to try the carne and the bondiola (pork shoulder). The bread the sandwiches come with is incredible. It's a little crunchy on the outside, so it doesn't get soggy from the delicious juices from the meat. Both meats were cooked perfectly, melt in your mouth. They also offer you free, additional sauces that you can serve yourself. I tried all four, my favorite was the chimmi. This place is worth any amount of wait!",

    "text": "Yeah, I know what you're thinking! 3 stars for Gaucho Parrilla Argentina? You're CRAZY!!!  That actually may be a True statement about me, since my mother has never had me tested! But nevertheless, I did not enjoy the charred, ashy flavor of their meats (particularly the ribeye steak sandwich). I didn't add any additional toppings (which might have helped), but I wanted to taste the purity of the meat. Also, the ratio of meat to veggies was ridiculously lopsided with thick cut roasted veggies being probably 70% of the sandwich. Considering the cost of the sandwich, I would have expected more meat.  Although I liked the burger much more, I was not a fan of the hard breads they use to compliment their sandwiches. I also did not enjoy the strong flavor of the roasted potatoes and the beef empanadas were just okay.   My tweenage kids took a bite and refused to eat any more of their food. They have a serious dislike for anything that has a burnt flavor and I honestly couldn't argue with them. I love a decent char, but today it was like eating cigarette butts from an ashtray. I felt so bad because I really hyped this place up to them after reading reviews and getting recommendations prior to my visit. So I took them down the street for a bowl of pho to make amends. Another visit may yield a better result, but as a first-time experience goes, the food did not live up to the hype. The restaurant itself, the decor and the staff on the other had were awesome! What an eclectic collection of humans!   FINAL THOUGHTS  This place came highly recommended, which makes me dread writing this review. I definitely don't want this to be a slap in the face to all the awesome yelpers who suggested Gaucho as THEE place to visit for my one day trip to Pittsburgh, but I gotta be honest. Besides, there are so many positive reviews here that I doubt mine will even be noticed.

No, Altar Bar is back to being a church and it's Gaucho's notoriously long line to try their authentic, wood-fired Argentinian grilled meats. Like Smallman Galley, they don't accept any reservations, but they have a much smaller staff/location, so the wait can be a bit daunting, especially if you're waiting in the mid-day sun during the lunchtime rush. I recommend going during the mid-afternoon lull on a weekday if you don't like waiting for potentially over an hour. Otherwise, be prepared to spend some time chatting with hungry strangers in the Strip. Once you finally get inside, make sure you try the their collection of self-serve sauces which include chimichurri, roasted tomato, roasted garlic, roasted onion, etc.",

    "text": "Unreal. No other words besides unreal. Being from New York where great restaurants abundant and being spoiled with good food I was skeptical when I came to Pittsburg. In look for a restaurant with real, fresh food was the mission. Luckily I passed this restaurant driving and saw a line of people out the door with almost 30 people down the road. I made it a goal to try the hype the next day. Menu is very accommodating to any kind of meal you'd like. So I decided to order a little of it all.   The steak- medium rare rib-eye COOKED TO PERFECTION! And the flavors? Incredible  The el Gaucho salad- so fresh tossed with a balsamic vinegar   The chiqui chicken small plate- chicken cooked so tender  The spicy chorizo- if you enjoy heat, this is most definitely the dish for you   The layout is great, open kitchen, multiple sauce stations for my saucy people and best of all BYOB -- WITH NO CORKING FEE? Hello. This place is amazing.   Point blank.",

The seasoning are on point. This place gets crazy lines on the weekend, but you should be able to snatch a table on a weekday evening if you get lucky. The place is small but does open up around backs and has a hipster-ish ambiance.  You order at the counter and then take a seat (if available). Tons of great chimichurri sauces are available for dipping. I had the carrots with goat cheese for a side and they were surprisingly delicious and recommended to share.  If you're arriving, just be aware for the potential for long lines and no potentially no place to sit. The food though? Worth it!",

The outdoor seating area is just as charming and warm as the indoor. I've enjoyed an array of the menu items, from the steak to salad to sandwiches.

When I show him the picture that I want to eat (because I couldn't guessed what kinda meat would be like without a picture), even though the dish is not in their menu anymore he recommended me something very similar and even out some pickled onions to mimic the closest version.

    "text": "In all the places I've been, all the time I've lived in Pittsburgh, and I only JUST made it to Gaucho last night for the first time.....but it was so worth the wait.  We decided to try to beat the crowd by being there around 6:45 on a Wednesday.  It was busy, but not line-wrapping-around-the-building busy.  There were about 7 parties in front of us and we stood for about 30 minutes.  When we finally got to the counter, they opened our wine and gave us wine glasses and water, then we placed our orders.  The menu is large and almost overwhelming because it all.sounds.soooo.good.  I ordered the deconstructed carne sandwich with flank steak. My date had the large Argentinean salad with flank steak.  We were seated and our food came out about 15 minutes later.   I got two of the sauces - one that pairs well with steak and the other that pairs well with vegetables.  Everyone is so insanely friendly and helpful at Gaucho - you can really tell they enjoy their jobs and take pride in the food they serve.  Everything was excellent.  The food, the wine, the service, the atmosphere.  I'd say my only complaint is that I think they do such a great business but they could really take it to the next level by making it a traditional sit-down, take your order and serve you type of place.  I would be more inclined to go back regularly if that was the setup, but I just am turned off by the line.  Definitely a place to try ASAP!!",

The problem I had with the whole experience was the setup of the whole restaurant. Not only was ordering annoying and made me feel like I was at a high class fast food joint, but the menu was extremely wordy, confusing, and the only way to view it was on a huge blackboard up front. It is also worth mentioning that with this setup you'll be stuck up front holding others back while trying to figure out what to order. If it's busy you will probably feel pressured to make a quick decision from a lengthy menu.  Despite the annoyances up front I had no issues with service and the food was good enough to save Gaucho from a lacking experience. Besides burnt cut of toast, the steak, chicken, and chorizo that I ordered was done well and accompanied with some tasty sauces. I guess I can forgive Gaucho for it's annoying setup for a good meal:/",

I did not participate in any of the sauces unfortunately. My fresh garlic allergy did not allow me. The only reason I knocked off a star was because I ordered my meal without garlic anywhere due the allergy and my steak came out with the chimi sauce on it, which does in fact contain fresh garlic. So, I had to send it back, which I really loathe doing. The staff was great about getting me a new steak quickly; however, the rest of my party had already consumed a good portion of their meal because we had to get back to the office.",

So to start off the place is busy on Sat night first come first serve no reservations expect a line but it's popular so it's expected.The are a lot of choices from steaks ,sandwiches, seafood paella, and appetizers. We got the paella with a side of beef empanadas and some ribs which were all good. The place is BYOB which is a plus. I will have to return again some time and try a steak to give it a full review but it was good. The place for the record is young and youthfull with music playing and isn't by far a quiet romantic place. It's all part of great food and great service.",

Note that it can get pretty busy here around lunchtime (especially on nice summer days), so consider coming on the early side if you don't want to wait in line forever.  I only have one minor complaint with the establishment -- parts of the bread sometimes come out pretty burnt (and burnt food is a suspected carcinogen). But, you have to balance that with the deliciousness, so I figure it's worth it once in a while!",

You actually get in the line to order and then they bring the food to you. We got the combination platter of all the steaks which came with three pieces of yummy chargrilled chili bread. I wish this place had wine and beer instead of BYOB since we were out of town but we were lucky in that the patrons ahead of us were all too kind and gave us a half growler of beer. We also tried the passion cookie which was pretty good. Customer service was very good. Argentinian steak a little bit different in that they're thinner steaks fired on a chart grill and service sauces. I prefer reverse year and a big steak to get that perfect medium rare and enjoy it with just salt and pepper; however, the flavor of the sauces and seasonings were really yummy here and there are some days where I crave this type of steak.",

Their gaucho sandwich is off the wall but it's been a few years since I first tried it. Don't think anything has changed, just gotten better. So if you eat beef, WHADDAYA WAITIN FOR! The only thing that has changed is their expansion which means more people have gotten to appreciate this place as much as I did a few. Years ago :)",

Word to the wise- get the deconstructed option right off the bat, else you will just do it yourself. We tore the delicious bread into hunks and paired it with the perfect bite of fire roasted peppers and caramelized onions and steak, trying each sauce. My hubby like the green best, but I couldn't get enough of the red. The dessert of the day was to die for. It was worth the wait in line. May I also add that the ability and encouragement to get your own water and sauces is perfect- I hate asking waiters for a ton of stuff. Great atmosphere.",

    "text": "I have wanted to try this place for a loooooong time. I work on the North Shore and every day going to and from work I smell the deliciousness of meat being smoked when I pass Gaucho going over the bridge in the Strip District. But finally the day has come!   My husband and I actually went here before a Yelp event (that Gaucho was actually providing small bites at...go figure). I got the rosemary braised beef and potato and bacon soup. The sandwich was so big, I  actually just ate the meat because I didn't want to fill up on bread. It was soooo good. I could probably eat a steady diet of just that morning noon and night for a full week. There was a horseradish sauce on it that really paired well with the rosemary flavor. The soup was also incredible and super flavorful. I probably could have done without it because the beef was so filling, but I'm glad I got it just to taste it! My husband had some sort of pork sandwich with pickled onions. He couldn't stop raving about it so it was also a win.  One thing I also want to comment on is how extremely friendly the staff is. You can tell how much they love their business and care about their customers. If you aren't sure about a menu item, be sure to ask for a full description. Someone will be happy to tell you about it no matter how busy they are!   The space is more of a food counter than a restaurant, so if it's busy you might want to consider getting your food to go, but I see they are looking to expand soon so that's very exciting!   I totally understand why this is yelp's numero uno in Pittsburgh! If you haven't gone here yet, you do not know what you're missing!",

I also had a small chopped salad that was perfectly dressed - it was lovely, but I loved the others more.  Try it.  I plan to bring my son there to try the shrimp.

Time. In fact, I recently tried their empanadas again, which I always counted as the weakest point in their game, and I was stunned by how much better they are than I recalled.  For the sake of history, my original review (where I assigned them two stars) follows:  I love Gaucho. It is my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Unfortunately, today I had a terrible meal at Gaucho... far worse than any previous experience there. My coworker and I both had steak burgers for lunch, and we both thought that they were very salty and overcooked. We both ordered our burgers to be cooked to medium, and they came easily well done. Additionally, the bread they were served on was more burnt than toasted.  Gaucho is still a favorite, but I hope that food like I had today will not be recurring.  I fully expect to leave a far more favorable review on my next visit.",

We ordered the shrimp, carne hanger steak sandwich, grilled veggies, potatoes, grilled corn, and 2 bottled waters. Our total was almost $50.  That's a little high for what I'm accustomed to paying for basically a carry out joint, but hey, you only live once.   While we waited, I stocked up on the sauces because I wanted to make sure I had the opportunity to sample each one. The chimi sauce is awesome, btw. We got our food and we were off to the hotel room to enjoy it. I started eating the potatoes in the car because 1. They smelled delightful. 2. I'm pregnant. And 3. \"Who gon' check me, boo?\"   You could tell the potatoes were batch cooked because some were piping hot, while others were just luke warm. It's a good thing my parents were in Michigan because the flavor of those hot potatoes would've made me slap my mama! Seriously though, the fresh potatoes were very, very good.   The corn was awesome! My hubby thoroughly enjoyed his shrimp and veggies. The flavor of my hanger steak sandwich was off the charts, but it not as tender as one would hope. The toughness of the steak caused me to deduct a star. Overall, this is a solid place with great food and awesome flavors. Definitely a must-try.",

I was informed that Gaucho uses 100% olive and corn oils (no blends) and no butter or milk (at least in what I ordered). I had the sweet potato mash, mushrooms, avo salad, and tried some of the steak burger. Very friendly service and cool atmosphere. Definitely recommend.",

    "text": "Great experience. Hip place ! Crowd was mostly young adults , some looked like empty nesters. Had a San Francisco joint feel to it which I liked. Trendy but relaxed atmosphere.   Food was nice . Tried their grilled shrimps, chicken wings, and the beef burger. It had a fancy name that I don't remember. Be prepared to stand in line for a while on a busy night before you order. After you order and pay, you are seated and food brought to you relatively quickly. Kitchen is behind he counter so you can see the action while waiting in line. Prices are fair to a bit high. Don't go there if you are looking  for a quite place. Louder music and people talking in a not so big place. We were loud too so were fine. Saw a couple changing seats due to noise but I'm sure it didn't help.   If they could do something about the long lines which easily goes out the door around the block and noise levels, would give them 5 stars.",

Roasted potatoes and empenadas were really good too. All 4 sauces offered were amazing. Cant say enough about the whole experience. Will definitely visit before leaving town and every time I'm back. Definitely check it out.",

    "text": "Delicious!! They give great suggestions if you're feeling overwhelmed by their menu.  The meat is perfectly cooked and all of the dips and sauces are delectable. Lunch for 2 costs around $25 and there unfortunately aren't many seats unless it's nice outside, then they have patio.  Highly recommended.\\  Word on the street is that they're beginning work on the seating! That can't come soon enough!!",

    "text": "We went to Gaucho at around 6:00pm on a 70 degree Saturday and, you guessed it, the line was out the door. We waited an hour from the time we got in line to the time we placed our order and it was worth every minute. Our party of 4 shared the pescado, the grilled veggies, an empanada assortment, the smaller meat platter, rice, the short rib special, and the rosemary braised beef sandwich. It was ALL delicious and we ate every bit with the exception of about a half cup of rice. Fun, relaxed atmosphere and the food is served quickly! BYOB makes it even better - we brought a bottle of red to share and then capped the meal off with some cold Rumchata. One of the employees, Micah, was chatting with us, getting refills and brought us rocks glasses with ice for the Rumchata. He was extremely friendly and helpful. My only wish is that you could sit down and order like a \"regular\" restaurant. And that they held off a bit on the cowbell, it was extremely loud and happened too often for my parties' taste. It won't stop me from going to Gaucho again though. I look forward to the next rosemary braised beef bite!",
