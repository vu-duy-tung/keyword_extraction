    "text": "Service was way below average. While the chicken tortilla soup was delicious, it came out at the same time as my entree which is unacceptable. The server nonchalantly said they had to make a new batch of it. It would have been nice to know before it came out that there was going to be a delay. My salad came out with tomatoes, and I specifically asked for no tomatoes. When the server brought back out a new one it had remnants of tomatoes still in it so I ate around them. Once I brought these to the attention of the server, he never once came to check on our meals and see how we were doing. He never refilled our drinks. We also asked about the draught beer selections and the server was not knowledgable on these and did not even offer to go and find out information on them. There needs to be more of an emphasis on service. Even though this is a casual family chain, attention to detail is still important. Retrain your employees, specifically Kyle, I only found his name out from the check he dropped. He didn't even apologize for the mistakes throughout the meal when he dropped the check.",

Boy am I glad we did. This is a truly unique restaurant. I haven't been to a sit down restaurant, with a bar, decent beverage selection that sells chocolate chip cookies and has a sundae bar.   We started with the Max Draft Beer for just $5, Blue Moon and Troegs (a local brew and first try for me) and ordered dinner. My boyfriend had the \"3-course\" option which was tortilla soup or salad, a 6 ounce beef burger or turkey avocado swiss burger, and a chocolate chip cookie. I had the philly cheesesteak and asked the waitress to doctor up my fries to their loaded fries. They put fresh and crisp bacon, white cheddar cheese curds and this delicious beer cheese sauce. I highly recommend this cheese fry option. The sauce is truly yummy and is served very warm.   We finished off with a light, quite beautiful pitcher of pineapple, white peach sangria.   All in all, I will definitely stop back anytime I'm in the area.",

    "text": "Don't mind the map folks, this place is in the heart of the Robinson shopping Mecca.  It is located on the same Andrews Drive as Sam's Club, Lonestar, Don Pablo's, and Citizen's Bank.  M&E's fits nicely in the same niche as the TGI Friday's and Applebees of the world, however after today's visit I'm convinced that M&E trumps the rest of the All-American Grille type establishments.  This particular location (and the one in Stanwix from past experiences) offer a higher level of food quality than the same genre's competitors.  The service and value offered was great as well.  This time around there was three of us in our party.  Two burgers and one Club sandwich was ordered along with loaded fries, a Coke Zero (mine!), and Pomegranate Margarita.  As an appetizer a cup of the Tortilla Soup looked and tasted rather scrumptious, the tortillas were fresh, the soup very very very savory and my favorite part was that it was LOADED with cheese.  I didn't try the burgers, but I've had them before that their good.  Both of my friends thought they were rather good.  They also raved about their loaded fries.  Although it was said that the corn on the chili with the loaded fries was unexpected, haha.  I had their Club Sandwich...and darn was it good.  The bread was fresh, which I think makes or breaks the whole thing.  Ham and Turkey were salty enough to be mmm mmm meat but not enough to overpower the perfect amount of veggies and cheese included.  Unfortunately we didn't take a crack at the Sundae Bar or their oven-fresh cookies.  Mostly because the portions for dinner were big enough we took part of our meals with us to-go.  M&E's in Robinson was certainly a VERY pleasant experience...I'm looking forward to checking out some of their other menu items.",

Cool thing #1, Apparently they have a sundae bar? #2, They give you free chocolate chip cookies. #3, They have fried dill pickles! The pickles were sliced instead of spears, so yay for that. I wish the pickle itself was saltier/dillier, but I enjoyed the cornmeal batter. I had their tortilla soup and village salad. Both were tasty, and the whole meal was $10. Not too shabby!",

That was disappointing, but we still visited and got cookies to go! The last few times we went we got the same waitress who was VERY slow. Food came out wrong a few times, (nothing major, bacon on a burger when I didn't ask for bacon) so we hadn't visited in awhile. Today we visited for dinner. It was somewhat busy for a Saturday afternoon and we had a great waitress! The menu was different than the last time we visited.  It went from a spiral bound book to a single piece of menu paper front and back. They took away the \"make your own burger\", but when I asked for it, the waitress said I could get that still. So, I got my usual' a cheeseburger with a fried egg on it. The waitress returns after a few minutes and tells me the cook said they do not have eggs so I cannot get a fried egg. A little strange, but ok, I guess.  Also they now have changed their burger to 1/2 pound burgers as opposed to the two sizes they used to have (the erma and Max). Not a complaint since I don't mind more food, but something worth pointing out. Not happy with the menu changes. I sure missed my fried egg burger!! How does a restaurant not have eggs?  Update 8/1/17: went back because we had a gift card and coupons. Fried egg burgers are back! Had great service and good food!",

I ordered the pretzel appetizer both times, and I had a different sandwich each time: the stacked club and the California grilled chicken club. Both were delicious, but the chicken club stood out.   I absolutely love avocado on anything and this club sandwich had half an avocado sliced on the top! It also included grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato, bacon, and a drizzle of ranch dressing. All basic ingredients that combined to make a real winner in my opinion! To top it all off, the service was fast and friendly. Just what I needed at the end of a busy Saturday.",

I forget the official name but it was steak with mushrooms or something, I felt like the food was average at best !!  it was maybe comparable to or even below Eat N  Park standards. The bathrooms were definitely dirty and stinky-- both bathrooms. The waitress/service  however was awesome she was very polite on point  and all-around great but I will not be visiting a Max N  Ermas again.",

Cooked just the way I like it and it was one of the best I've had in a while, the Tortilla soup was amazing, the fries well wasn't the best part of the meal and if I would of known I would of asked for something else, and the cookie! White chocolate macadamia, excellent!  Great value good food.    I noticed that the bar had lots of TV's but only had a couple of people ... could be a good place to watch a game ...

We always enjoyed the above average food and ambience here. While my son was away at college we never had an opportunity to eat a Max & Ermas until he recently graduated. For old times sake we went in June 2016. What in the past was a decent meal was now inedible. What a disappointment! The food and service have drastically declined. The waitress and other service people could care less. The place is dismal and its deterioration was best represented by the fact that their staff began vacuuming while the few diners were eating their meals. Max and Erma must be rolling in their graves at what has become of their namesake. My advice-- don't go to eat here",

    "text": "The boyfriend and I took a whirlwind trip to Pittsburgh to see the Steelers-Ravens playoff game. We were trying to eat at places we'd never been to before (so, no Chipote or Five Guys or Don Pablo's) and were intrigued by Max and Erma's. We had never heard of it, so we thought we'd give it a try.   Our server was really nice and service was very prompt. She always checked on us to see if we needed any refills and how our food was. The service is really what makes this a 3-star review instead of a 2-star.   The food was probably more of a 2-star. It was okay, but certainly nothing extraordinary. Bf and I decided to split two sandwiches for some variety. We chose the chicken-tomato-mozzarella and the cheesesteak. The chicken sandwich was pretty good: the chicken itself was cooked well and was moist, the mozzarella was tasty, and the tomatoes and basil were appropriately proportioned. The cheesesteak was underwhelming at best. Maybe I'm spoiled to a local cheesesteak place, but this was definitely not what I expected. It was very much a chain restaurant's attempt at a cheesesteak.   I heard they had a sundae bar, but we didn't partake. Maybe that would've made up for the underwhelming cheesesteak, but oh well.   Basically, Max & Erma's is a fast casual chain restaurant like a Friday's or Bennigan's.  The next time we make it up to Pgh, we're going to try to stick to local places. We know what to expect from Max & Erma's, and it's just kind of \"eh.\"",

    "text": "I'd only been to a M&E restaurant 9 years ago in Downtown Pittsburgh. I remember making a mess of myself trying to eat their burger.  This time I used silverware.   What I did was modify their Honkytonk Burger, which aleady came with pulled pork, BBQ mayo, deep fried pickles, and bacon between two pieces of Texas toast. I added a spicy mayo, guacamole, and caramelized onions among some other things to make it a little more heinous, so much so that eating it by hand was futile; a knife and fork were required to dispatch the beast for good. Nonetheless, it made for a pretty mighty (if not legendary) medium rare burger, one that dripped like a leaky faucet when I first bit into it.  I had a taste of Kay's Laredo Steak and was transported to Ruth's Chris for half a minute. Seared to an on-target medium rare and seasoned well, the square of beef wilted in my mouth with little chewing needed.   Whether or not they are pre-fabricated, their sextet of fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies are a fun, rudimentary way to finish the meal. Just like their damn fine seasoned french fries, the cookies have an outer crisp and a thermal, soft interior made bloody rich by the melted choco-bits. And they come to you on an aluminum pan with a spatula.   Marilyn, our server was a delight and handled her duties well.   I'm not regretting our post-wedding visit with Max and Erma late yesterday morning. They're a cute couple to hang out with even if they have many counterparts all over the U.S. of A.",

We didn't have to tell him that we needed additional drinks or anything and he would refill them before we got to the bottom. In addition, I had left my water bottle at the table and he chased us down the parking lot to return it. Kudos to our waiter as he made the experience great!  As for the food, we got nachos as an appetizer. It was HUGE! Definitely needed to share it. It was good with lots of sour cream and guacamole. For entrees, we all got the same thing which I thought it was a good deal. For $10.99, you get soup/salad, a cheeseburger with fries and a cookie. I had the caesar salad which was pretty big and filled with plenty of cheese. My burger was good but I loved the fries the most. It was definitely a good lunch spot and as mentioned, the service made it better.",

    "text": "I need to review this place while it's fresh in my mind.  I don't want to miss a thing.  We showed up here during the monsoon that moved through the area which probably wasn't the best time to do so.  Not sure if it was the weather, or if this place is in the process of going downhill, but there were not very many people in here.    Let's talk about aesthetic of this place.  It has a fun community bar/grill type of atmosphere.  You have your Americana all over the walls.  Throughout there are booths, tables and high tables.  Set up is what you expect.  However, because of the rain, there was one section of the seating area closed off for everyone.  This area appeared to be a sun room or a former patio that was closed in.  It was leaking something fierce that they had buckets, pans, and what not to catch the water.  Halfway through our meal they finally turned the heat on in the place and with that there happened to be a high pitched squeal going on that no one knew how to stop.  So atmosphere wise, this place was failing badly.  Food wise, well, if you really want to know, here goes.  We started out with the Garlic Parmesan Cheese Skewers.  Nothing more than blocks of mozzarella breaded and on skewers and then deep fried.  Served with marinara and ranch for dipping.  They were exactly as described and hit the spot as an appetizer.    Now, our entrees, yikes.  My better half started out with the Tortilla burger.  It's kind of odd how this is done.  Their description states that this is voted the best cheeseburger, however he was not impressed at all.  It was kind of sloppily put together and even though they describe it as their soup turned burger, it really doesn't come across like that.  I did not look at the description of the burger, but I thought maybe it would have been a burger served between tortillas, this would have been more fitting than saying it's your soup turned burger.  To him, it was haphazard at best.  None of the tortilla strips stayed on the burger and the size of the soup they give you for dipping looked more like a soup shooter.  For \"award-winning\" this definitely did not come in first in his book.  As for my entree...welllllllllll.... I'm a big meatloaf fan, so I thought why not try their take on this dish.  The description states that it is a meatloaf with a blend of cheeses in it and glazed with a bourbon BBQ sauce, OK, you got me on the hook.  Also it would be topped with \"crispy onions.\"  OK, start reeling me in.  Online menu is different here than what you see in house, online says you get mashed potatoes and a corn medley, in house you get to choose your sides.  I chose mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli.  So really reel me in here now.  When I got the plate, I was severely disappointed.  Presentation counts for something, so that was a little off putting.  The plate was sloppy, the portion where the mashed potatoes were there was a smear from the edge of the plate down to where they rested.  The crispy onions...onion rings (why not just say that when you type a description).  The meatloaf, well, yeah, here's the thing, I expect a meatloaf to have a firm, yet forgiving texture to it.  Not what I got here.  Portions of the pieces that I did receive were hard as a rock.  So bad that my knife would not cut through it.  It was also dry.  It was liked they either cooked it and left it under a heat lamp or quickly cooked it in a microwave before sending it out to me.  Needless to say, this place left a bad taste in my mouth, pun intended.  On shining spot here was our server.  I am so glad that we had you as our server, I do not remember your name, but you were stellar.  You were helpful, kind and fast.  You were very accommodating for us, and I thank you again for wishing me a Happy Birthday.  Much better than your one coworker who told the table next to us that you didn't have a tomato based salsa.  I'm fairly sure pico de gallo is tomato based, but that may just be me.",

It's Friday in Lent so seafood for me. Ordered 'Nawlins Shrimp'. Is 'Nawlins' yinzer for greasy? Has anyone seen my server? Will I make it home without a pants-filling blowout?",

Our waitress was on a smoke break (we could smell it), so we had to wait a few minutes until our waitress arrived.   The Chicken Tortilla soup was amazing as always. I tried a new Gouda and Bacon Burger, which was interesting and delicious. The Gouda was melted so it changed the flavor. Instead of lettuce there was spinach on the bottom between the bun and burger, so it didn't fall apart.",

    "text": "There's a lot of seating here so it's great to accommodate large groups. Also, our waitress was super kind and attentive. They have a lot of healthy options on their menu which is great. I had a veggie burger with asparagus- asparagus was delicious, and the veggie burger was good but the texture was pretty mushy which put me off. One of the people in our party also found a hair in our food which was upsetting, and the bathroom could use more cleaning as it was pretty grimy. Overall I'd say the cleanliness needs more attention but the atmosphere is nice and the menu is great along with the service. Also: they have a cute little make your own sundae bar which is a bonus!",

Our dinners -- salmon for me, meatloaf for the husband -- were outstanding.  You could tell that each entree was prepared with the utmost care for taste and presentation.  We were thrilled.  Our server, Liz, was a doll and very attentive and efficient.  All the staff in this restaurant pitches in and stops by to ask if you need anything, takes away dishes, etc.  My drink was never not full and the price was just right.  With all the restaurants in the Robinson Towne Centre area, it's easy to forget the old standards -- don't forget that Max & Erma's is there, you'll be glad you remembered.",

Maybe it has to do with the location of this good restaurant around so many less impressive choices?  Staff seems friendly and invested in your enjoyment, if staff is your objective.",

    "text": "Eh. As an extended family, we've met up w the kids, parents, grandparents, & such twice this month  in the mid afternoon after shopping. It's extremely family friendly.  Both times MY waitress was EXCEPTIONAL.   Both times management was abrasive and awkward; as was other staff.   During our first visit, upon being seated we asked the manager if we could change our seating due to where our high chair would be located. The manager loudly sighed and rolled their eyes! I was shocked. I know rotations are a pain but the place was empty so there was no need for the high chair to be where it was.   As our food arrived, only our waitress worked alone to bring it out. (Weird when so many people were doing nothing) Several waitstaff, a bartender, and the hostess were hanging out at the hostess stand chatting. I forgot to ask for a plastic spoon for my toddler. I approached the half dozen staff who were gossiping and asked for a set of plasticwear.  I was told that I would have to wait for my waitress to return and to ask her to get it. The hostess, bartender, and other waitstaff (on the clock) continued to chat as I returned to my seat. Who does that?   Now as for our food. It was really good. We tried a bunch apps. Something to munch on but not dinner. Ordered the meatballs, nachos, quesadillas, buffalo tenders, black bean roll ups. Everybody ordered an appetizer. When food arrived, we realized that we ordered way too much. The food was nice in size. Kids loved it. Everyone was very satisfied w the food orders. We boxed up a lot to go home. The dogs were quite pleased with dinner later in the evening.   Chicken Fajita Quesadilla- 5 pieces of chicken quesadilla w peppers and onion, served w guacamole & Pico  (yum)  Kids Burger- 2 mini cheeseburger- kids loved them. Quality beef. Gobbled down quickly  Cheese App- 4 skewers w 4 cheese cheese cubes on each. Serves w ranch and marinara. Like sophisticated mozzarella stickers.    Meatball- a gigantic meatball. Didn't try it but was a hit amongst the family.    Nachos- really big. Good. Kind of expensive. Would order again for happy hour price but not full price. Could use more cheese.   Black bean roll ups- really likes these.  Ordered steamed. MrToddler loved them when dipped in ranch dressing.   Because of the food & our server. We decided to try again. Bad idea.   Yesterday, we sat next to a dirty table throughout our entire meal. For over an hour.   Meanwhile, I could see the manager and other waitstaff chatting and resting at a wait stand in the next section and doorway to the kitchen.   My waitress and others in my section were clearly over their heads trying to run food, drinks, fill ice, and take orders; while other sections had standing around doing not a thing, leaning on stands and talking. Bizarre dynamic.   Looking at a dirty table for over an hour isn't enjoyable but watching staff not give each other a hand is irritating.   As for managers. Could they be any more awkward? I doubt it.  I give credit to the servers working there who are providing excellent service and going above and beyond.  It's pretty obvious that they're doing it on their own.  While I could write further in depth about the food at Max and Erma's, I feel it's a waste of time due to the low quality of management leadership & morale ruining the dining experience.",

Our service was good as well and the restaurant looked clean in the dining areas. I will definitely be back - they seem to only have a few of these chains in the Pittsburgh area these days.",

Our on most recent visit with baby in tow, the staff were super nice, and gave us a bunch of individual saltine packets to keep our little one entertained. My husband had the burger, we I assumed he enjoyed because he basically went to town on it. :) I tried their new ham & pesto ciabatta and yes to the tomato-pesto mayo I want it on all of my sandwiches from now on!  And while we didn't have it this time, both my husband and I are big fans of the tortilla soup.",
