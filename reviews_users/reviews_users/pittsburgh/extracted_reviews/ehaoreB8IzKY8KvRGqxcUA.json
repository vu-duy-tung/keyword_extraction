Good food, good people and darn good selection of beer.  Everyone will tell you that their sweet potato fries are a must. They are awesome - so don't miss out. Most people will say you have to try Fuel's wings or Rosemary's Breasts, which are fine, but honestly, I'd have to recommend the Classic Veg Head and the Smashed Potato. They put the Veg Head sandwich in the brick oven just long enough so the provolone cheese melts over the hummus and veggies - it is phenomenal. And who would have thought smashed potato on a pizza would work, but believe me, it does. Plus, there's bacon and ranch dressing to help solidify just how good it is.  Fuel is not a big place, so be prepared to wait for a table - but it's completely worth it.",

We stumbled into this place, after a tedious drive, and chowed down on some great grub.   No qualms with the food, the party of 6 was happy! That is a rare occurrence!  Oh I had a $6.00 dinner, since I got a side salad, a side of veg, and a side of fries. All were satisfactory, and yummy.",

Our server was indifferent to anything she was too busy eating her own food and drinking her soda to be bothered to ask if I wanted a refill. Oh and she spent a good five minutes talking to a customer she knew. When I complained to the male host he didn't care at all.",

I had some wings which were cooked perfectly. Everyone got something different to eat and no one had any complaints. I ended up getting the Alligator Stew. It was pretty spicy, and not what I expected. But I really enjoyed it. My brother got the chicken chili which he also said was very spicy. As a family we like spicy foods, so it wasn't an issue. All around happy table and for a group of 7 with some beers and dinner, our tab was about $125.00",

My time away from being a regular here has made me appreciate it more than before.  It's still crowded, it's still small in size, and it's still as loud as can be.  But that does not deter me from entering, as it should not deter you.  The food is just as good as I can remember too.  Even though it had been some time since I dined here, I still ended up getting my old reliable.  The Befuddling Sirloin Burger is still as befuddling as I remember.  The 100 proof bourbon BBQ sauce is just enough on this sandwich that I never need to top it with anything else.  Their burgers are amazing, not a traditional patty in any sense.  It's not round, it's like it was round then they decided to take a rolling pin to it and elongated it.  Good thing they did too, to fit the bun they put it on, it cannot be round.  The bread sometimes puts it over the top and really makes it a gut buster.  Also, I didn't need any other side than their handful of russet and sweet potato fries, a great compliment to a great sandwich.    My friends decided to both have the 1/2 rack ribs.  Smothered in the same BBQ sauce as my burger made it just as mouth watering.  They put all that deliciousness on top of a bed of what looked like grilled veges.  A really nice mixture I am told.  They also top this off with a handful of the mixed fries.  The price takes a bit out of the pocket, but it is totally worth it.  *a few notes about this place: parking is horrible (read as: be prepared to circle the block, or take the hit to use a garage), best to call ahead to get a table at peak hours or sit at the bar, if you don't want to wait visit one of it's sister eateries right next door, delivery available through Wheel Deliver for a few dollars more.",

(Especially when you come in after 11pm, at which point nearly everything becomes half-price!) The beer selection is even better. And on Sundays, they have one of my favorite brunches in town. The \"sausage egg-stacy sandwich,\" with its Breadworks roll and gooey provolone, is my personal Kryptonite. (If Superman couldn't stop eating Kryptonite -- so maybe it's more like my personal crack.)  The service can be a little hit and miss -- partly this is because the servers are all quite young and this is a super-crowded place, almost all the time, and also partly because it's a college hangout, and sorry to be ageist, but college freshmen tend to gum up the fine-tuned gears of any restaurant they enter. However, from time to time you will also get something a little overcooked from the wood-fire grill. I've had nachos that were a bit scorched in the past, for instance. (95% of the time, though, they totally rule.)  All told, this is an absolutely worthy place to have a meal. I thought that at 18, and I think that at 30. (And from an anthropological perspective, it's a damned interesting place to people watch.)",

They would mix the sweet and regular fries together and let me tell you, the regular fries were sorely neglected every time!    Funny thing is, this place is such a college-y hang out, but it's actually a really great place to grab food in Oakland.  Plus, the over 21 crowd can enjoy the great beer selections they have on tap here.  I LOVE places with a wide selections of beers on tap!  For some reason beer just tastes so.much.better out of a tap!  All the wood grilled selections are fantastic! For apps....3 words: Fire Baked Brie.  3 more words: TO DIE FOR!  I've also always been a fan of the individual pizza's and the Sierra Grilled Chicken Salad for the lighter side (of me!).  The sammie's are also very good.  I'm always into a good Portobello option, and the sandwich is fantastic with light balsamic drizzled on top.    Annnnnnnd bargain time for poor hungry college students and people who still act like poor hungry college students (maybe me).  It's half price food after 11 PM.  I may not have went to school in Oakland, but we would stuff ourselves (literally sometimes 7 people) into one tiny car to have some late night bites.  Seriously, there's a lot I do for food and being squished inside a car for a 10 minute drive is totally worth it here!",

This is also the place to go if you are looking for a unique beer to try as they always have a great selection of drafts. I went with the Blue Point Pumpkin which is one of the better pumpkin beers.  The pizzas are always a good choice as they are baked in a fire brick oven. It was between the smashed potato (highly recommend) which I always get and the flying buffalo. I went with the flying buffalo which was topped with pieces of wings, celery and blue cheese. Delicious!  Also a neat thing about this restaurant is they give you a fortune cookie with your bill.

    "text": "Decent bar food when sober, absolutely revelatory when not.  Appetizers tend to be good and filling. Chicken wings are sizable and the seasonings are unique. Everything really benefits from treatment in the live fire. Nachos are excessively cheesy but benefit from wood firing, as does the quesadilla. The optional chicken chili on both of these dishes is hearty and smoky.  Main courses are a bit of a mixed bag. All the pizzas are delicious, as the oven imparts a nice char and crispness to the crust. Sandwiches are disappointing, as the bread they serve everything on is far too doughy and chewy without much crust to speak of. Burgers suffer from a lack of seasoning and inspired toppings. Fries are overhyped, both Uncle Sam's and Joe Mama's on the same street offer far superior versions. The sweet potato fries are decent, but again overhyped. Steer clear of the big plates, every time I've ordered one I wished I got a pizza instead.  Desserts are wonderful, but let's be honest, when aren't they?  Don't miss the great beer selection. House brown and pale ale are always on tap and fairly good, other than these they keep 8 others rotating draughts. The bottle list is gargantuan, there's bound to be something for everyone.  Atmosphere is LOUD and service isn't always on par. But hey it's a college spot, what do you expect?  In short don't miss the apps, wood fired pizzas, and great beer list. Avoid the bland sandwich offerings and big plates.",

Their burgers are generally served on really nice Kaiser rolls that are plush like pillows and the sweet potato fries are quite excellent. Their pizzas are also some of the best around in Oakland. The beer selection is quite diverse although rather overpriced.  For larger parties, there is an area downstairs with a couple of televisions tuned to sport channels (although your experience with service will suffer).   Unfortunately I don't think I can rank this otherwise fine establishment any higher due to its inconsistent service. There has been too many times when it has been difficult getting a check or the attention of the staff. I attribute this to poor training compounded by the flaws of my generation.",

We didn't want to go to a dive bar, it needed to be open past 12 and we needed to be able to order food. This place checked off all of our boxes. The place was cool, small, had high ceilings, decorations on the walls, and felt warm- aesthetically. Our waitress was really good. She served me my first legal drink. The prices were really good. We were there at a time that the late night menu was available, so food was cheaper. As a college student, who does not attend Pitt, it was still really cool to be there and be around younger people. I got a blackened chicken wrap and it was so so good.  I didn't even get a picture of it, because after my first bite, I wanted to eat the whole thing. I also got fries with it and they said that they could give me sweet potato and regular fries, which changed the whole experience for me. I thought that was really cool, because I love both fries. We got chicken wings too, they were really good. Everyone I was with was happy too. They offered bottles and tap and they had so many whiskey and bourbon choices which was really cool. The menu was cool because it explained the differences between whiskey and bourbon which was cool to read. Would return - happily.",

It's quite heavy though, so I'd recommend sharing that.",

The only reason I give it 4 stars is because parking can be hard to find (only street parking is available) and there isn't a great spot to stand and wait for a table to be ready (we have always had to wait for a table when we go.) The pizzas, pierogis, and buffalo chicken dip are awesome! And the beer menu is always changing and has some really great options on it! Highly suggest.",

There's never just one mouse in a house! Told the waiter who had the manager come over and offer an explanation. Although it's hard to rationalize a live mouse in your restaurant. Even worse I didn't eat another bite so my meal was free but my companion paid full price. Tacky. My advice is to eat elsewhere as I am fairly sure that mouse and his family are having the run of the place after closing. Should have closed and called an exterminator immediately but that didn't happen. Gross.",

    "text": "I'm giving Fuel & Fuddle 1 star for each goal I saw the US Women's Soccer Team score in the final during the 20 minutes between ordering my meal and finishing it.  The goals didn't really affect my review, but it certainly made dining here even more enjoyable. I was staying nearby, and F&F was one of several interesting places for dinner within walking distance of the hotel, and we deemed this one most interesting. I think it's a stretch to call it a gastropub, it's more like a tavern edging towards gastropub.   The menu is outstanding and well organized, especially the beer by type - though I'd rather actually see a bit more about the beers such as where they are from. Without that, I was still happy to settle for a Great Lakes Eliot Ness amber lager.   Normally at a place like this, I would order a burger. But since I had had one for lunch, I instead opted for a bowl of the chicken chili and a side of southern slaw. The chili was lukewarm temperature-wise, but it had what I felt was a just-right amount of spicy warmth. The slaw was fresh and I'm pretty sure homemade, but I found nothing about it which made it \"southern.\"   One of the other people at my table let me sample his hamburger - delicious, I'd definitely order one here - and it came with not just regular but sweet potato fries as well. The sweet potato fries have a sugary coating.   Service here is very casual, but we were checked on frequently - just the right amount for a place in a \"college area.\" If I were living in the area or attending school here, I'd dine here often.",

    "text": "Ah, Fuel & Fuddle. Fuel & Fuddle was one of my college dining favorites - but since I'm no longer a student, I wondered when I stopped in today if the place would be as good as I remembered. It was - woo!  A friend and I came by for dinner after a day at the museums, and as previous Pitt students the noise and collection of young diners didn't surprise us - we just got our seat and raised our voices so we could hear each other as we talked. While looking at the menu I was surprised by how many beers and ciders and whatnot they offered; the last time I ate here I was under 21, so I didn't remember this at all. I saw that the portobello sandwich I'd eaten here previously was still on the menu (ah, good times), but figured it would be nice to try a few other things. So my friend and I each ordered a burger (his made with regular beef, mine a black bean patty) and decided to split their Rollafatty.  The Rollafatty appetizer is basically two mini pepperoni rolls, served with a side of sauce. Very greasy, very cheesy, and very yummy - I'm glad I split it, though. Then our main courses came out on that were plates 100% covered by our food. I think the burgers were pretty standard restaurant sized burgers, and the other half of our plates were full with a mix of regular and sweet potato fries. The fries, while a bit salty, were absolutely delicious; so was my black bean burger, the Garden Of Eat'n. I love black bean sandwiches and appetizers in general, and this one was covered in pesto sauce and mixed with other burger toppings - very yummy! I loved what I ate but ultimately left with about a third of my sandwich and most of my fries (plus my friend's - he didn't want them), as neither of us could finish our entire meals. I doubt we could have even if we skipped the Rollafatty appetizer.  Graduate or not, I'm definitely still a fan of Fuel & Fuddle - it's not fine dining but it's good pub-restaurant (burgers, sandwiches, pizzas, salads, etc.) and they have a great selection of drinks, and the service is generally really quick given the crowds they bring in. Of course, if you stop in while school's in session you will have to share your eating space with students - so as long as you're ok with that, I recommend stopping in to eat here sometime. The sweet potato fries alone are worth it!",

The burgers stood out on the menu, even though there looked like plenty of interesting entree's, but many of them seemed more like dinner...  Ordered the Hangover burger.  I'm always a sucker for a bacon and egg burger.  Burger was fantastic, cooked a bit more than the med-rare, but close enough.  The side was a half and half mix of sweet potato and regular fries, the sweet potato fries looked like they had been sitting for too long, a bit shriveled and fairly chewy.  The other fries were great.    I didn't order any beer or cocktails, but looked like a great selection of beer.  Dropped a star because of the fries.  Overall a good experience, would give them another chance.",

After a quick glance at the menu, I appreciated the different types of beers being broken down into subsections as I'm not a beer connoisseur so that helped me with my selections.  I started out with a Rollafatty for my appetizer. When the two fatties (food) came out, they were extremely hot and came with a side dish of marinara sauce. Each was filled with a large amount of cheddar cheese and an average amount of small sliced pepperonis. They were crisp on the outside but weren't dry on the inside due to the immense amount of cheese. Beware, these were extremely greasy but oh so good!  I ordered the c'mon iwana leiya for my main entree which is a Hawaiian Pizza. The crust was thin, golden brown and a good mix of crunchy and chewy. The pizza tasted fresh... Not like it was frozen or premade hours before. It was a good size for a single serving.  I finished my third and final beer with a nutter butter pie. It was rich in peanut butter flavor but not overpowering.  Throughout the night, different people came to the bar that I was able to chat with. You could tell some were regulars while others were there for business or conferences. A good evening of trying different beers and eating a very satisfying meal!",

The sweet-potato fries are the best I've ever had, the pizzas are always good, and the sandwiches are big. When I go I mostly order off of the appetizer menu.  Never had a bad time here, but if you aren't there at 11pm then expect a wait of up to 40 minutes. I've had some people be skeptical when I've said it's worth the wait, but I've never had a complaint once the food came. Also it isn't very expensive before the half-off, so I've been here many times during the day - you just feel kind of bad that you could be getting it for so much less",

If you're up for waiting for a while then I would suggest the half off after 11pm deal, but I do go here for full priced food.  My favorite is the 'Goin Cold Turkey' which is actually a very simple meal of a huge slab of turkey, red onions, chunks of tomatoes and garlic mayo on a big soft bread roll.  Its served with their famous mix of sweet and regular potato fries.  I haven't been dissapointed by their pizza or their salads either.  The fire baked brie is also a tasty little morsel that I would suggest for sharing.  It can get very noisy in here, and if you sit in the basement you can feel a little excluded.  Nothing fancy here, but I would suggest it for a Lunch or Dinner with friends or family.",

Anytime after lunch and you're in for mostly the undergraduate/grad student crowd.  The menu is quite varied.  Appetizers, salads, pizzas and sandwiches line the pages with funny names like, \"Rosemary's breasts\" (a delicious chicken sandwich, recommended with the cajun mayo, lettuce and tomato - you need to ask) and \"Rolla fatty\" (a pepperoni roll with mozzarella baked in...delicious). I also recommend the house salad with apples and walnuts.  Stay away from the chili and most of the \"large plates.\"  I don't think they sell enough of them to remember to prepare them properly.  Good food (mostly). HORRIBLE for conversation.  This place is built entirely from painted cinder block = no noise absorption whatsoever!  Fuel always proves good for a young crowd during a sporting event but I would NEVER bring a date here...ever.    Great for college kids, they offer a 1/2 price menu on most items after 11.  It was great when I was in school.  Things get really tight in there though.  They have a great beer menu - one of the best in Pittsburgh.  I would give it 3.5 stars if I could.

We ordered a buffalo chicken pizza, which was just about perfect with its thin crust and brick oven charred bits. We also ordered the dip sticks (with mozzarella) and the zen wraps as \"appetizers\" (they would probably be considered entree-sized at most other restaurants). The dip sticks were a bit zippier than expected, but still pretty good with the marinara sauce. The zen wraps were quite unique, and incredibly delicious.  We ended up having to take a lot of our food home, because there was so much of it (even though it was only two apps and a personal pizza). I would suggest starting with one dish and going from there.  This is the place to go for late night munchies and decent prices. We'll definitely be going again before our trip is over!",

    "text": "Quite possibly my favorite place in the entire United States. It's unfortunate it has to be in Pittsburgh, PA...but that's part of what makes it awesome in it's own way. I am giving this place the honor of my very first Yelp review even though I have not lived in Pittsburgh for more than a year.  This place has amazing American pub food. The nachos are piled high with an indeterminable amount of good toppings. The buffalo wings (and other kinds of wings) are large, properly covered in sauce, and perfectly spicy. But the best food here are the pizzas. The Flying Buffalo, the Garden of Eden, et. al. No matter what mood you are in, there's an awesome personal pizza to be had.  As if the food wasn't enough, they have probably the best (not the largest - the best) beer selection in Pittsburgh. House brews and Great Lakes (from Cleveland), Guinness, Yeungling, all on tap. More than 50 others in bottles. At decent prices too!  Almost all food is half-off after 11PM every night - which is key.  On Saturdays, the \"house blues man\" Don Sjzeck, plays his awesome mix of Johnny Cash, Greatful Dead, blues, and rock covers as well as his fun sing-along original stuff. It made every Saturday night awesome for me.  Hangover Breakfast on Sunday mornings is great for its stated purpose. Unlimited coffee, bloody marys, etc.  Do what you need to do and go there one night. It's worth it and its an awesome Pittsburgh experience.",

They are some of the best wings in the city, up there with Bufflao Blues and Quaker Stake.  The pizzas are excellent, especially the mashed potato pizza.  I encourage everyone to try it, wonderful smashed potatos, chedder cheese, bacon, lettuce and ranch dressing.  Their other pizzas are good as well.  They also have a wonderful selection of very good sandwiches and burgers.  Their stake and potatoes and alligator stew are also excellent.

Fuel is the best place in Oakland at night, particularly if your over 21. It's a little crowded but the beer selection (100 different varieties) is the best virtually anywhere. The half price menu starts at 11, so you can go there get dinner and drinks with some friends and it's a good night.  The food is always excellent, and after 11 a good value.  The service is always good.  I love the ambiance of the place, but I could see how people could find it irritating. It's loud (particularly when there is live music) and it is crowded. However in my four years going to fuel this never once dissuaded me, because the half priced menu is just too good and trying the new beers is just too much fun.",

After the wait, we were lead downstairs, which we found to be quite empty. (Granted, there were about 4 or 5 tables there, but only about 3 people left the place.. from upstairs. So maybe they were just waiting for a waitress for the downstairs area.) Food and drinks were pretty decent for the price. The oven-baked brie (with honey and apple slices) tasted pretty good.

If you come in with ten, you may want to call ahead to get the less noisy basement tables, no matter what time of day. Brunch is the best, in my opinion, as Fuel transforms from a noisy, dark college restaurant to a calmer, lighter atmosphere. Also they have specials on bloody marys.  Half-price starts at 11 pm, and includes about 65% of the menu. Like all half-price in Oakland establishments you will see a line unless it's a school break or you're there 30 minutes early. It's worth the wait though for delicious food. I'm a fan of their salads, but their pizzas are pretty excellent also. Desserts, like the apple burnover (think huge brick oven baked apple turnover with vanilla ice cream), are quite enough for two.  Beer selection is fantastic, and conveniently laid out for you in the menu, prices and all. If you go there for the drinking, be sure to get some crab dip. You will not regret it.

When you step in, there's always a fun message on the chalkboard usually making fun of something to do with chain restaurants or horrible NASCAR style beers...neither of which have any connection to the fare or beverage selections here.  There's a dizzying selection of bottled brews on the menu, but attention draft fans the larger chalkboard inside the place is what you want to be looking at.  There are always a dozen or more interesting worthwhile selections up there and if you're stuck for suggestions, there's an employee favorite listed at the bottom.  The food is delicious and portions are ample, most of the time if we don't split an entree we end up with leftovers (never a bad thing!).  I don't think we've ever tried a dessert but we've had most of the salads and sandwiches and several of the entrees and never a disappointment among them (also, there are a bunch of unique pizza options though we've never really been into pub pizza, preferring the big floppy NYC stuff).  Favorites include the buffalo burger, turkey burger, meatloaf sandwich, and the salad with the candied walnuts and avocados...thought you probably can't go wrong with anything they serve.  Finally, in Oakland tradition, late at night most of the food (see menu for details) becomes half-off for those on restrictive budgets (or those who would just prefer to preserve more dollars for the aforementioned draft selections).  If you're in the Pitt/CMU area and looking for something with more variety and better sit-down atmosphere than Primanti's or the \"O\" definitely surf over to their web site and see if the menu catches your fancy!",

The crowds of fellow college students means I'm sometimes in the cold for upwards of half an hour, waiting for a table.  And by the time I'm done, the buses aren't necessarily running, so I have to walk home in the cold.  But it's still quintessentially college to me, so I keep coming back.  I actually don't like most of the food.  The vegetarian sandwich I got was kind of bland and the bread was pretty terrible.  Not a fan of the pizzas or nachos either, though I know some people are crazy about them.  It seems overpriced for the quality, except maybe during half price... but then you're tipping double and possibly ordering drinks, so you're not saving a ton of money.  Some pluses: they have a terrific beer selection (or so I'm told; I don't drink beer) and great wings (again, I don't eat them).

Overall a great place, you just have to be willing to put up with the hustle and bustle of a busy restaurant at the heart of a college campus.",

I had a byo burger, that had dozens of topping choices, which is awesome. Something to note however, my burger came with both sweet potato fries and regular fries (little weird). My dad had a one of F&F's pizzas which was decent, but not the best. Another food group to note is the apps, I had the nachos and the pierogis, both outstanding. If you aren't a cheese person the nachos may not be for you. I would definitely recommend the pierogis though. Along with the food, our waitress for the night was nothing short of fantastic. She was attentive and knew her stuff when it came to the menu and the beers. You could tell she's tried the food and drinks and led you down the right path.   Next, the ambiance is very casual. The sound level is on the higher side, but it's all within the range of the type of place Fuel and Fuddle is.   Overall, Fuel and Fuddle has excellent bar food, and with my experience a great waitress. I would definitely recommend F&F to anyone in down town Pittsburgh. It's a great place.",

Hostess was sweet as could be, the server though unfortunately was SO rude. Ordered two pops, was thinking on getting an Angel's Envy old fashioned, but I didn't have enough time to order because she immediately left the table. Drinks are dropped, no straws, no problem at all. I ask another server/\"bartender\" for two straws because the moment our cups hit the table she was gone again. After an eye roll and hair flip, she gave them to us, I said thank you & got another eye roll, rather than you're welcome, or even a damn smile. Server comes back, asks if we're ready, we get nachos and we're still deciding on meals. Gets us appetizer plates, nachos come out & she asks us if we're ready yet, I replied \"Not yet, I think we're gonna snack-\" and before I could finish my sentence & order a Caesar salad, she huffed and puffed and walked right away. At this point I was fuming, asked for a manager. Meg, the manager who touched the table was amazing. Very professional and took care of our nachos even though we insisted on paying for them. Very disappointed in our first visit.. if we decide to return I'll be sure to remember the people we've dealt with today.",

The first time when I went with a small group, I love it the burger was delicious and their sweet potato fries is everything! I love it. The second times I went with a group of six and they seat us down in the basement. For some reasons, maybe the server forgot about us but we waited forever for the food and for our water to be refilled. I didn't have a good experience. However, the third times I went with a group of 12 and we were again seated in the basement but food came out quick and everything was tasty. The only reason I didn't give them a four stars is that one experience and also I like BRGR or burgatory better. The food was great, but it wasn't Outstanding.

Which were awesome and I loved that mu burger could come with half sweet potato and half regular fries. Made my night. My friend pointed out the buns werent toasted before I noticed and so they were a bit coldish. So thats why I knocked off a star. But that shouldn't deter someone from coming here for late night eats when you are craving greasy, cheesy,  guilty pleasure foods.  The beers and spirits are priced fairly and the small batch stuff is worth a try I hear, which is something to do next visit.  #takingbackyelp",

After a long night studying or at the end of a fun weekend, Fuel is the best place to go with friends.  2. Everyone finds something addicting to order at Fuel (many people more than 1). The burgers, pizzas, sandwiches, appetizers, and - surprisingly - SALADS are all addicting in different ways, and the main struggle ordering is deciding between all of your favorite dishes. I always end up ordering the Skinny Dip (buffalo chicken dip), but I also love the Smashed Potato Pizza, Hog Heaven, Veg Head, nachos, and Chipotle Polka. All of the sandwiches are served with a mix of russet fries and sweet potato fries, and lots of people pay the extra $2 to get all sweet potato fries because they're amazing. To be honest, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!  3. If you want to try 100+ beers/whiskeys, go to Fuel. They have \"Beer Bibles\" to keep track of which ones you've tried, and you make it on the wall when you get to a certain number.   The atmosphere at Fuel is dark and sometimes loud, and the servers are quick and no-nonsense. Try it out to see for yourself!",

There are so many different beers and whiskeys to choose from here, and I was impressed.  I didn't order anything this trip, but I would definitely consider coming here for late night pizza and whiskey.  Let me start by saying that the menu is massive.  Anyone can find something to eat here.  My friend and I split the Bada Bing ($10) and On the Lamb pizza ($10).  The Bada Bing was a grilled Italian sausage sandwich with sweet peppers, onions, marinara & provolone.  The sandwich was OK, but it was a bit dry.  The pizza had gyro-style lamb and provolone cheese, and was topped with lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumber dill sauce.  It was super unique, but I enjoyed it.  The food was pretty standard and nothing to write home about.  I would come back for the late night $5 pizza special and to drink, but I don't think I would stop back in just for dinner.  The atmosphere is fairly loud, if that deters you.",

    "text": "Fuel & Fuddle is one of the major reasons I come back to Pittsburgh. Forget homecomings, reunions, or weddings, the one undeniable reason to visit is Fuel & Fuddle for, of course, late night half-price.  As a poor college student, the Fuel & Fuddle 11pm half-price was a saving grace from the mundane university dining options. Not everything on the menu was half price, but most of the good stuff was. The menu is fairly unique, but also familiar and executed very well. There's something here for everyone, including vegans, vegetarians, girls who just don't eat that much, bros who eat a ton, and beer snobs.   My fraternity brothers and I would come here every Sunday at 10:30pm to put our names in for groups of 10, 20, even reaching 30 on one crazy night. Good food, good conversation, some of the best memories I had in college. The waitresses are always very friendly, and are usually very attentive.  I've tried just about everything on the menu, but here are some of my favorites :  Goin' Cold Turkey -  HUGE slab of turkey, with a HUGE portion of fries (russet or sweet potato). I usually ask for the garlic mayo on the side to dip both my sandwich and my fries in. Unbeatable.  Smashed Potato Pizza - One of the more unique pizzas they had here. A layer of mashed potatoes with ranch, lettuce and bacon. Pretty amazing.  Flying Buffalo Pizza - Buffalo wings on a pizza. Enough said. I usually asked for bleu cheese sauce instead of the crumbles they put on for a creamier texture.   Swamp Rub Wings - A bit on the salty side, but a pretty unique peppery rub. The wings in general here are all delicious, and are all jumbo sized.  Only thing here I would avoid are the wraps. My friends and I ordered them on several occasions and they didn't even come close to comparing to the other sandwiches on the menu.  Overall, my many fond memories at F&F might make me biased, but this is one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh, if not the entire country. Count on F&F for great All-American bar food and great times to be had by all.",

    "text": "Fuel and Fuddle will always hold a steady spot in my heart. The atmosphere is very \"college-like\"--loud and obnoxious. There is a bar and TV's with the latest sports update. The lighting is kind low and dark, but that sets the mood I guess. I love going here for half off specials (after 11pm). The wait could be kind of long during the weekend for half off, but so worth the wait. Get there a little earlier to secure your seats on the waiting list.   This place serves your typical All-American grilled and fried dishes. Oh yeah did I mention half off after 11pm? Let me say it again: HALF OFF AFTER 11pm. As a college student living on a budget, I take advantage of this every weekend. Their portions are huge and with the half off special, you could probably order like THREE dishes for approximately $12. Can't beat that.    My favorite thing here is their sweet potato fries. I get it every time I'm at Fuel and Fuddle...the crispiness is truly an addiction. Some other favorites: rosemary chicken breast sandwich, cold turkey sandwich, and skinny buffalo dip. The sandwiches and dips are perfect every time. The wings, however, are a hit or miss. The last time I had the wings, they were really dry. Not a huge fan of the wings.   Overall, I highly recommend Fuel and Fuddle if you're in the Oakland area late at night and looking for an opportunity to feast like a king with the budget of a peasant.",

I will say when I asked for the other half of my wrap to be boxed up the waitress came back with a box for me to do so, which in general I'm not a fan of.

    "text": "I came here this past Saturday after the Pitt vs. SBU game for a bite to eat. I hadn't actually eaten here in quite some time and I ended up being pleasantly surprised with the food being tasty as I remembered it being. We got there right before the big after game rush so we were able to snag a booth. I didn't catch our server's name but it took us (and I'm not exaggerating) 15 minutes to get our first drinks. They were drafts so it's not like anything needed to be done except pouring them in glasses for us. The draft list was  not what i remember it being. They had maybe 10 to choose from however, they were all from 2 breweries. I'd have liked to see a bit more variety since that is what I always remember them being known for-their beer selection. After we finally got our first drinks we put in an appetizer, the fire baked brie. The brie was baked in their pizza oven wrapped in dough and served with caramel drizzle and apple slices. The taste was very good-oozey,cheesy,gooey-exactly what you'd want it to be. I think they should serve it either with more apple slices or some type of crostini or crackers. For entrees, my boyfriend and I decided to order 2 pizzas and split them amongst the two of us plus his friend that ended up joining us. We ordered the flying buffalo (Fresh Mozzarella with Grilled Rosemary Chicken & Celery Tossed in Our Scratch-Made Buffalo Sauce Finished with Crumbled Bleu Cheese) and the slaughterhouse (Housemade Tomato Sauce, Fresh Mozzarella, Giant Pepperoni Slices,Crumbled Italian Sausage and Apple Smoked Bacon). Each was around $9 and was an 8 cut pie. The flying buffalo was my favorite. The sauce was not overly hot and it blended nicely with the blue cheese. I only sampled one slice of the slaughterhouse and it was basically a loaded meat pizza. It was pretty good however the crust was pretty burned. The friend joining us ordered the chipotle polka (Mini Potato & Cheese Stuffed Pierogies Smothered with Sweet Onions, Bacon and Smoked Jalapenos in Adobo Sauce. Topped with Sour Cream,Cheddar & Monterey Jack Cheeses) He had a lot to take home but he said they were pretty good. I'm not a pierogie  fan so I can't attest to his review since I did not try them myself. overall Fuel and Fuddle is still a good place to go in Oakland, just be able to tolerate extremely slow service and possibly having to wait for a table if there is an event and you don't arrive before the rush.",

    "text": "This will always be my favorite go-to late- night college student food spot! It has a fun, underground vibe, and with half price meals after 11 pm it's perfect for a college student.  The best dishes are: - Smashed Potato pizza: It is so good! By far the best thing on the menu. Actually me and my boyfriend like this so much that we've even tried to recreate it!  - Skinny dip: Replace the chips for the delicious sweet potato fries! They go really well with this spicy buffalo chicken dip - Turkey wrap: For the days you're not feeling adventurous or want to pretend to be healthy - it's still pretty good though!  The wings are good too but I wouldn't try to explore this menu too much after that (the rest of it isn't that great). A lot of the dishes here are pretty hit or miss.  A few cons: After 11 pm this place gets ridiculously crowded. If you have more than 4 people in your group you'll be waiting for at least 45 minutes even if you show up 15 minutes before half price time to put your name in for a table. But I suppose time is the price you pay to get your food half price. Also I am not a big fan of the bar - I ordered a drink here once and the bartender took what was nearly double the price of the drink and didn't give me any change assuming it was a tip! I tried to get her attention a few times to no avail.  Although I would not come here full price (after paying half-price for so long), this was a great place to hang out with college friends and eat some cool eclectic food!",

There is a nice amount of car and road trip inspired memorabilia--signs, hub caps, license plates, etc. The bathroom downstairs was kinda gross, not unexpected for a college joint--the floor tiles were cracked, the urinal stalls had dried on spray on them and the smell was like someone dropped a case of air fresheners in a portapotty  The service was attentive and the hostess did a great job accommodating our large party of 6 adults and 2 children at 6 pm on a Saturday without reservations. The servers delivered drinks quickly and gave us enough time to make decisions on food without having us feel like we waited forever.   The food overall, was fine, but a bit disappointing. I ordered the \"Aporkalyse Now\", which is a burger with 50/50 beef/bacon burger topped with more bacon, pickled banana peppers, and melted cheese. This was pretty disappointing. I asked for the burger to be cooked medium, but the server said that because it has raw pork in it, it had to be cooked medium well but it would be juicy still--however, it wasn't. The burger was dry. The kaiser roll the burger was on was cold, dry, and stale. The fries were cold and soggy. For a self-proclaimed \"gastropub\" the food was very poorly executed. My dining companions ordered the pulled pork (which they really enjoyed) and the quinoa burger (also dry). Everyone else's fries were warm to hot, so my cold fries were a definite kitchen miscue.   The beer selection was very good. The bottle list was impressive and the draft list featured diverse offerings that varied in both style and alcohol levels. The prices were very reasonable for all the beers for $3.50 for a yuengling pint to a $6 Lagunitas Barleywine  I think Fuel and Fuddle would be a great place to hang out, have a snack, and a pint of craft beer. However, to call this place a gastropub sets up unrealistic expectations",

We ordered Fire-kissed Quesadilla, Classic Veg Head, Chipotle Polka and the Cajun Chicken Sandwich (which I cannot find on the menu for some reason). They also have an array of beers to choose from.   The Fire-kissed Quesadilla was mouth-watering, veg head was good and the cajun sandwich, even though a tad chewy, was lip-smacking. The Chipotle Polka was nothing but a few pierogies deep-fried in oil. Though oily, it was delicious. For dessert, we ordered the Big-Ass Brownie. It was both 'big-ass' as well as devilishly good. It was the kind of dessert which you would eat and immediately feel guilty about.   Even though the food quality wasn't the best, it was clearly value-for-money because of the half -price thing. I would recommend everyone to visit this place and especially try the brownie which definitely lives up to its name.",

We were seated in a corner, and although no one was sitting near us, the place felt cramped. Our waitress was just going through the motions and seemed annoyed.   The food wasn't that great, either. The sweet potato fries, which were the main reason I wanted to try this place and are advertised as \"world-famous,\" had a great, crisp texture, but were way too heavily seasoned. I would've preferred them plain. We also ordered the Classic Maggie live fire pie (a pizza), which was a plain pizza with about three pieces of basil on it. The crust under the cheese was soggy; there was nothing special about the pizza.  All in all, a good deal for under $10 including tax and tip, but I probably won't be returning, especially not if I have to pay full price.",

Like a good consumer should, I've tasted my way around F&F's diverse menu, ordering something different each time, in addition to mooching a bite of my friends' dishes as well. What I have to say about the dishes I've had: Havana Burger - unique. I love the aioli, the ham, and beef all working together here. Not a huge fan of the heavy buns that are served here, but the contents make up for that.  Hog Heaven - I'm a pulled pork lover, and theirs really hits the spot. I think they use their own bbq sauce, and it's the perfect balance of sweet and spicy. The meat is shredded evenly, and I never got a disappointingly dry lump of pork in my bite. Props! The pepper horseradish dip this sandwich comes with is AMAZING with the sweet potato fries. Maybe even better than it is on the sandwich! Smashed Potato Pizza - If you love carbs like I do, get this pizza. Everything great about loaded potato skins and pizza in one personal flatbread. Do it.  Build-your-own Burger - Got a classic burger with pickles, onions, lettuce, mayo, topped with a fried egg. Only gripe was the dense bun again.  Pulled Pork Quesadilla - I honestly don't know why this works. It is fantastic... The quesadilla flows over with deliciously juicy pulled pork and a mix of gooey cheeses. Served with a house salsa and sour cream. Enough to fill a grown man.   In general: - Fries here are great. They do a mix of russet and sweet potato fries. They are the only sweet potatofries I have ever liked. - Atmosphere is perfect for what they're marketing. Bar and grill with the feeling of a dive bar and a resteraunt at the same time. (If you use the bathroom in the basement you'll understand me a little more) Sometimes it can be a bit dark or too loud, but always to a manageable degree.  - Service is friendly, but sometimes the workers forget to be up to date with resteraunt policy. Sometimes the check could be split, sometimes my school id is an accepted form of paymentand sometimes not, and a hostess once forgot there was outdoor seating for the resteraunt.   Bonus points: - Fuel & Fuddle. Fuel: Recieve energy from food. Fuddle: Confuse someone by using alcohol. Name isn't just catchy, but clever too!  - From 11pm-1am they have a killer $5 menu (includes many things I enjoy)  - I don't drink, but they have a wide, WIDE, variety of drinks to choose from.  Verdict: You'd be dumb not to try this place out. If you enjoy it, you'll come here lot!",

Their fries are different than they used to be 10 years ago but if you didn't visit then you wouldn't know any different and would still think they are delicious. I recommend going when school is not in session for less of a wait. No complaints otherwise!",

The only negative was the server was a little blah -- she made a big production about getting us glasses so we didn't have to drink our beer out the cans.  We all got different types of pizza and everyone left satisfied.  Great place?",

I am personally a huge fan of there sweet potato fries I don't know what's different from there's to others but it's so hard to stop eating them. Today I decided to try the flying buffalo pizza. I am so happy I did because it was so delicious it all paired together so well. The dough was thin crust but had such a full flavor. The chicken was packed perfectly with flavor notes of the rosemary. The scratch made buffalo sauce was beautiful not to spicy or overwhelming flavor. It all blended together so well I was so pleased. I had to get some to go being I couldn't finish it all because the portions are large. I will definitely be returning here in the near future.",

    "text": "Another Oakland staple, Fuel & Fuddle is the go-to gastropub for Pitt students. Fuel's vibe is meant to appeal to the college student's \"indulgent\" tendencies. Menu items names like \"rollafatty,\" \"rump shaker,\" and \"grilled psychedelic\" all play into this theme; not to mention the blatant \"Route 420\" painted on the wall. Food-wise, pizzas, sandwiches, wings, and their signature mixed sweet potato/traditional fries will absolutely satisfy your cravings, regardless of whether or not those cravings were influenced by any botanical studies you and your friends conducted beforehand. Pitt isn't a STEM school for nothing, amiright?  With over 100 drink options, Fuel is a great place for new and old alcohol fans to try new beers and such. The low price late night menu begins after 11PM; I've spent countless nights chowing down here with my friends. I've noticed that the food quality goes down at 11PM: fries are dry from sitting outside the fryer, pizza crusts can get more burnt, turkey burger is not formed as well as it should be, etc. Regardless, it's still delicious and totally worth it: you get what you pay for at that hour.",

We were looking for a place that our whole family could go to that served food late and was open past 12. Fuel & Fuddle checked all the boxes with a late night food menu and a kitchen that stayed open til 1 and a bar that was open until 2! My whole family was impressed and both my brother and I were saying we wish we had such a great place to go to on our campuses. This place knocked it out of the park. Cheap food and drinks and a fairly extensive menu. Everything we ordered was incredible between the personal pizzas, wings, and wraps and our drinks were equally good. My mom and I opted for cocktails. Only $7 and extremely potent. I got the impala while mom opted for the Monte Carlo. Both really good. Our waitress was super nice and more than helpful to swing by our table again at 12 to serve my brother his first drinks. He ordered one of their whiskeys off of their extensive menu and a corona, only $3.50. All in all such a great place, if you're in the area especially for some late night eats- definitely swing by!",

She knows her beers and  doesn't let your glass sit empty without checking in. We shared the smashed potato pizza and the chipotle polka.  Both were delicious.   The pizza surprised us with some salad ingredients on top and they really make it great.  The potato is perfect with the crunchy crust. The chipotle polka definitely has some heat and spice.  Nothing crazy but a nice kick.  The pierogies were delicious just melting in your mouth.  I had a good variety of beers from the tap and everything was great and as advertised by our bartender. We were even able to get a good old Miller Lite from the cooler for a traditional beer and a shot to top off the night.",

It can be extremely crowded, and there are many times when you have an hour plus wait to get seated. - Also, don't forget - this is Oakland. Have fun trying to park!!!! :)",

Their menu is entertaining and there's something for everyone. My favorite is the Grilled Psychedelic sandwich. It's a portobello mushroom sandwich and is always very good. Their wings are great too! And they also have the option of getting sweet potato fries with your food! The atmosphere is spectacular - always fun and lively - and after 11:00 P.M. the food is half price!  I really do love this place.",

Fuel and Fuddle is one of those restaurants you go to expecting to have a great time, and that you'll enjoy the food because of that (ahem, Mad Mex).  While the food here is decent, I wouldn't say that it's anything to write home about, in particular.  The smashed potato pizza is pretty good, esp. with rosemary chicken on top, as are the \"skinny\" dip, nachos, and sweet potato fries.  I really think people come here to drink, more than anything else.  I'm not a beer drinker, so I can't comment on the beer (which is what most people seem to order), but some of their mixed drinks are interesting.  They have one that's mint flavored that I especially enjoy (forget what it's called)--but then again, I'm one of those weirdos who enjoys mint-flavored drinks (cf. my review on Union Pig and Chicken).  Overall, a fun place to come with a group or a few friends to get some drinks and munchies, but don't expect gastropub-quality eats.",

Highly Recommended: Buffalo Chicken Mac & Cheese  Skinny Dip (Buffalo Chicken Dip with Chips) Hog Heaven, especially because of the side horseradish sauce. Russet/Sweet Potato Fry Mix  Average: Rosemary's Breast Burger Salads (in general)  They are known for having great pizzas, but I've only ever had a bite here and there.  Half price after 11 is always super crowded. Good happy hour beer prices.  When getting takeout, I do feel the portions are smaller.",

F&F is not the only place that does the half price Late Night thing, but it may as well be, for me.  After 11 pm every night, most of the menu is half price. You do have to get there early (10:30 ish on Fri/Sat/Sun) to put your name on the list, but for students, standing outside and chatting with your friends is part of the experience.  (Edited to add: Don't forget to tip on what your full bill would have been!)  My faves include the sweet potato fries, baked brie (!!!), Smashed Potato pizza, and turkey or buffalo burgers. I've heard they have amazing beers (but I don't drink) and I know they've got some fantastic desserts (my fave was the bread pudding which is gone now, but the brownie and apple turnover dishes are delish too).  They also have a surprisingly good brunch, and for the record, the basement is much less loud than the upstairs.  Every time I go back to Pittsburgh, I make sure F&F is on the agenda. Like I said, it's not just a restaurant.",

    "text": "Disguised as a wood stove restaurant, Fuel and Fuddle also serves as a beer lover's emporium. As an undergrad student at the University of Pittsburgh I often would head over to Fuel and Fuddle during the late night hours for its unique takes on classic American cuisine. But it wasn't until I took a seat at the small bar in the corner that I realized I was in a place that was so much more than just a good place to eat.  The beer selection is amazing, literally hundreds of brews to choose from including pale ales, porters, IPAs, stouts, you name it and Fuel and Fuddle has it. On the wall behind the bar hangs the names of people who have at least tried 100 different beers. I even saw a plaque celebrating a patron who tried 1000 different beers. Count that. 1000 beers. That's pretty impressive.  Around ten beers are on tap, each one is a different style giving the beer lover a great number of options to choose from. If the draft beers don't fancy your tastes then you'll surely find a beer you love in the selection of over 500 bottled beers in stock.  For its selection of unique beers, Fuel and Fuddle's prices are varied. Draft domestics are as cheap as $2.00, but some of the rare micro-brews and import bottles can be upwards of $10, so if you are drinking on a budget it might be in your interest to check the price with the bartender before you order.  If you are looking for rowdy drunken foolery Fuel and Fuddle is not your place. The bar area is entirely too small for anything than merely drinking. Furthermore, if you are trying to find a place to watch a game Fuel and Fuddle isn't really suited for that either. The TV's are small and positioned at awkward angles coupled with the noise level from the restaurant makes it impossible to hear any of the commentary.  Fuel and Fuddle is best suited as a kick off to a night or a place to get a couple drinks after dinner. For a beer lover, the selection is unmatched anywhere in Oakland and can compete with any place in the city. For it's beer selection I recommend this bar to beer-lovers passing through Oakland.",

It has it all:  great beer selection, delicious food (sweet potato fries and chipotle polka are my faves), half-price after 11:00PM, and good atmosphere.  The food here is bar food taken to the next level with fresh and house-made ingredients.  There's still plenty of fried stuff, but it's always done with a twist or some kind of strange ingredient to keep it interesting.  The drink menu is full of powerful cocktails (16oz for 6 bucks) - try the 5-speed, you won't regret it.  The beer selection is the real star here though, with a constantly rotating tap selection with some real winners, and decent house brews.  Service is spot-on.  Bartenders are knowledgeable and helpful.   BOTTOM LINE:  Great food and drinks.  Half-price after 11.  A little step to the left of normal South Oakland fare, and a great place to start or end your night.",

The brick oven pizzas are exceptional and the menu contains a few unique topping options - see the \"smashed potato\" pizza.  The sandwiches and burgers all come on delicious twist rolls made by a local bakery.  The wings a crispy and drowned in a number of spicy sauces.  The half price menu after 11pm is worth showing up early and waiting for, but occasionally you get what you pay for (wings lacking on sauce, etc.).  The beer list is what really shines here.  With over 100 bottles and around 10 rotating draft selections, there's always something new to try.  You can even join their beer cult, try all 100 brews in their beer bible and get your name up on the wall.  The cult's motto - shut up and drink.",

    "text": "Apparently they have waffle fries again... they took it off temporarily so they could increase its price on the menu...  I guess I have to give them a star back. (did you know Mad Mex has waffle fries too now?)  The standards are pretty much their pizzas (smashed potato, buffalo chicken, etc.), waffle fries, and sweet potato fries after 11 PM when almost everything is half priced.  The wait is LONG as it gets ridiculously crowded as the masses of CMU and Pitt kids head down (if you miss the 11 PM rush, get ready to wait close to an hour).  Since waffle fries are pretty much the only reason to go to Fuel and Fuddle and there's no late night discount on them, I'd recommend going BEFORE 11 PM and just grab a drink with your fries and then head out to enjoy the rest of your night.  Their house beer is excellent and I believe they have a rotating tap.  If it happens to be Thursday, Friday or Saturday night and you're still hungry, you can head down to Sphinx Cafe where a guy grills up hot dogs (2 for $3), burgers (2 for $5), and pulled beef from 10:30 PM until 3:30 AM right outside.",

The thought that first struck me when I arrived was that the floor was covered in trash; dirty napkins, straws, french fries, and who knows what else.    We were seated at a small table and the backs of the booth seats were cinder blocks--not comfortable at all.  Then we were handed sticky menus, which prompted the use of hand sanitizer after handling.  When I asked the waitress for recommendations she basically said everything on the menu was great (definitely hard to believe).    As for the food, my husband ordered a margheritta pizza, which came out burnt to a crisp on one side but otherwise was fairly good.  I ordered the nachos, which were covered in burnt cheese, huge chunks of unripe tomatoes, a few black olives and half a carton of sour cream.  Both entrees looked very unappealing; I ate about four nachos before pushing the plate aside.    Out of the entire disastrous evening, the service gets the prize for very worst.  After the food arrived we never saw our waitress again and waited twenty minutes for our check.  My husband finally had to get up to look for her and found her texting in the back.  We ended up not leaving a tip, a definite first for us.    If your looking for a late night bite to eat, do yourself a favor and go across the street to Primanti Brothers.",

    "text": "I love this place mostly because I used to live on the same street Oakland ave and that they have late night halfsies.    I adore their baked brie dish that comes with honey, sliced apples and is dusted with confectioner's sugar, the price of $3.75 during late night is pretty much perfect.    I find most of their dishes to be just okay hence the 3 star rating.  But it is a deal that you can't beat and they do have a wide selection of beers, the best anywhere in oakland i believe.  Its a perfect place for college students without a lot of cash, but sometimes I wonder how they make money when most of their customers can't even drink.    There is always a long wait at the beginning of late night at 11pm and also beef and fish are exempt from their half off deal.    Another dish I always go to is their chicken or veggie quesadilla.  I'm surprised that I haven't tried all of their dishes by now, their pizza is mediocre as well.    If you end up here on any day the baked brie appetizer is the dish to check out, its the dish that sticks out like a sore thumb on their menu and it willl blow you away for the price, they would charge 15 bucks or more in ny for a similar dish.    their sweet potato fries are ok, the plus is that there is no upcharge for them, at least as of the last time i went i believe.",

    "text": "I would never, for any reason, eat here during the school year (mid-August until May). The food is just not THAT good, if you know what I mean. The place is also small, with too many small jammed together tables and is pretty loud, even in the summer in the afternoon.    That said, I have eaten here several times and the food has always been fine. I usually get the rosemary chicken or campfire steak and potatoes salad. Those have both been consistently good. My husband usually gets one of the chicken wraps - and they have also been decent. They give you a mix of russet and sweet potato fries -- if you get them when they just come out of the fryer, both are pretty good. But we have also gotten some cold, stale ones. They still don't taste horrible, but you won't be raving about them.   We totally skip appetizers here, they are small and over priced. Two small-medium sized vegetable egg rolls cut in half for 7.00 dollars seems a bit insane, especially since you can get ones that are a superior quality (less oily and the filling isn't mush) right around the corner for 1.25 a piece.   Next would be service - honest, it's probably the reason why we don't come here more often. Your order is taken quick and the food always comes reasonably fast, but on more than one occasion our server has never came back until she (we've never had a male server) drops the check off. We usually tip around 20% for good service, this place we consistently tip less.  Servers and hostesses have a tendency to gather near the back toward the hallway to the restrooms -- talking to one another or using their cell phones.",

It may not be the best restaurant in Oakland but they have a great selection of food and beers and they served sweet potato fries long before they were popular.  My favorite item on the menu is the smashed potato pizza.  Who knew that mashed potatoes, chicken, ranch, lettuce and tomato on a pizza could be so tasty?   I was dubious at first but there is something about it that works so well.  I'd recommend any of the brick oven pizzas.  If you're there after 11PM, food is half off but it gets really crowded at that time especially during the School year.     If you come just for drinks, you'll find that the bar area is pretty small.  They also have a downstairs area that can accomodate larger groups .",

    "text": "I think I've only gone once during non-half-off hours in my four years in Pittsburgh because my general opinion of Fuel & Fuddle is meh.  It's meh as in nothing to wow me, but not at all a bad-meh as I have gone pretty frequently during half-off hours.  Located right off of Pitt campus, you really can't beat a decent $5 meal.  For half-off on most nights, do expect to wait 15 minutes for a table and 30 minutes for your plate.  The food is okay.  It's basically average all-American food, although some dishes just aren't well made.  I remember I once ordered a salad dish with guacamole...couldn't finish it because I couldn't ask for water refill fast enough to wash down the over-abundance of flavor...  Then there was a chicken wrap that featured really charred chicken pieces that didn't taste too great and was WAAY too salty.  BUT I know that the potato fries are pretty good and some of their weird pizzas are pretty tasty...  Also, most plates have a good amount of food.  Yay American sizing =)  Overall, I recommend it especially if you're in college.  It has a college atmosphere and helps you stay on a budget.  And really, the food is SOLID to GOOD.",

Alas it arrived blackened beyond recognition and my friends complained about the way it smelled. And don't get me wrong i love a good bonfire and the scent of charcoal just as much as any girl, but not so much when it's on my plate. After that experience I've mostly stuck to ordered sweet potato fries and the pizzas. During another instance my friend and i waited an hour for our food. upon finally flagging down the waitress she revealed our order had been burnt and the chefs forgot to recook it. (I knew I smelled something burning!!) we only had to wait about 15 minutes for them to redo our order....but when they brought it to us it was the completely wrong dish. The waitress was very apologetic and handle the situation very well. And we didnt pay for our food. Apart from that the experience has either been hit or miss. Some days the pizza is spot on. Others days the crust is a charbroiled and shriveled husk. I must say I do love half off the menu after 11pm.",

It would get 3 stars if it wasn't for their half-price late night special which brings the food to a price that is so ridiculously cheap that it feels almost wrong. Plus a great beer selection--I loooove their house Fire Brick Brown Ale, brewed by Smuttynose.  Favorite things on the menu: Wings (seriously addictive bleu cheese, but unfortunately no celery), amazing sweet potato fries, and the Chipotle Polka--spicy mini-pierogies loaded with cheese, bacon, carmelized onions, and sour cream.  Avoid: The burgers are terrible, which is weird since they share ownership with Burgatory. Also not a fan of the too-sweet pizza dough.  Go before the half-price special starts at 11pm to put your name in for a table, or be prepared for a loooooong wait among lots of undergrads.",

Today was one of the rare occasions I didn't have a burger.  I had Hog Heaven which was excellent.  Large serving of pulled pork with bourbon BBQ sauce that definitely had a kick to it (good kick).  Always enjoy the fry mix of russet and sweet potatoes.  My wife had a wrap which she enjoyed, and my boys had a burger and pizza.  Everyone was happy with their meals.  Great draft selection with reasonable prices.  It does get crowded, seating is tight, and can be loud.  I don't frequent this restaurant as much as I'd like to.  There are so many options in Oakland but for a casual meal that you will be full after, this is certainly a solid option.",

Because of this, I would not recommend going there during regular hours and instead would recommend sticking to the late night discount. While they have a fairly extensive menu and the servers are usually good, the food often tastes like leftovers that were reheated in the microwave. This has happened frequently at different times of the day and therefore I can no longer consider it a fluke.   However, this is something I can deal with later at night. After 11 pm, Fuel has a $5 late night menu. It can get pretty crowded and noisy, but there really aren't many late night options in Pittsburgh. It is a nice atmosphere for friends.",

The portions are still smaller than what's usually around Pittsburgh, probably because it caters to the college crowd. There's mostly dim lighting, and and loud music, so I'm assuming that most students go there to socialize. There's also a large selection of alcoholic beverages.

    "text": "i got the bbq pulled pork fire kissed quesadilla yesterday to go and a side of sweet potato fries and my friend got the charred charlie.   the quesadilla was really good; nice bbq flavor and the pork falling apart and cheesy goodness, topped off with a nice sturdy tortilla. the edge pieces were crunchy and the center 2 were more soft so you kinda get a full experience also i don't know why but it tasted good dipped in the salsa too.   the sweet potato fries were also really fantastic!! not sure what the seasoning is but i'm addicted. also tasted great with the salsa.   my friend said the charred charlie had a tad bit too much wasabi for his liking and enough soy sauce to feed a small family (alarming considering we both put soy sauce in everything) but it could just be because of the way the takeout container was.   portion sizes and flavors were great overall, loses a star for my friend's sodium intake levels and the servers were not very interested in helping with the takeout order!!",

The atmosphere was pretty relaxed but you could tell you were in a college town bar/restaurant.   The beer selection is stellar with a wide variety of craft beers on tap. The food is average bar food - nothing remarkable to report. A friend and I came in on a Thursday night before heading to a Pitt game and were seated immediately. We shared the nachos with pulled pork and while we finished the plate, they weren't our favorites nachos we've ever ate. F&F does not do nacho cheese so it was just shredded cheese melted over a plate of nachos with cold toppings thrown on at the end. The pulled pork was the best thing on the plate, so I'd recommend just getting their pulled pork sandwich.   Would I come back to Fuel and Fuddle? Sure, if I was grabbing a beer before a game. But I have no intention to add it to my rotation of bar/restaurants.",

You can ask for sweet potato fries only instead of the mix that usually comes on the side of the entrees. Sandwiches are good... especially the braided bread they come on but I'm usually more satisfied after ordering multiple appetizers or pizza (also try the baked brie if you like cheese). Salads are a hit or miss depending on when you order them. Their honey mustard is pretty darn good.",

The portions here are really generous.  While not listed directly on the menu, you can request a side of just sweet potato fries (instead of the mix of regular and sweet potato fries), and the plate you get is huge.  The pizzas here are pretty good, with thin crusts that are nicely chewy.  The dessert portions here are the largest I've ever seen--the brownie is about three or four times larger than the typical bar brownie and the nutter butter pie is the tallest peanut butter pie I've seen.  I like how Fuel and Fuddle tried to put its own twist on the apple turnover with the apple \"burnover\" by using pizza dough instead of puff pastry.  The dough itself, however, could have been more sweet--even with warm apple filling inside, the chocolate sauce drizzled on top, and the vanilla ice cream, I felt the dessert lacked something.  As other reviewers have said, this isn't a place to go to if you want to have conversations.  In a party of six, I had to stick to talking to the people right next to me, and even then I felt like I was nearly shouting.  The food and drinks here aren't bad at all, but not quite enough to convince me to frequent this place if I'm not already in Oakland.",

It's a great place that makes you feel young, even if you aren't.  A great selection of beer is yet another reason why I keep coming back to Fuel &Fuddle.  Hungry and don't know where to go?  Run, don't walk, to Fuel & Fuddle.  Do it.  NOW.",

    "text": "Fuel & Fuddle has consistently remained on my list of Pittsburgh-restaurants-I-will-randomly-crave for the better part of 10 years.  I started coming here, as all Pitt students do, freshman year, for the luxury of half-price food after 11, and the chance to use our Pitt bucks (which I know have since taken on a different name - the dining dollars on your ID card that let you in to places other than campus eateries).  They could accommodate a group of us without a problem, and I can't think of an occasion where the service has been bad.  I am also a huge, HUGE fan of their brunches.  These are easily the cheapest brunches in the city, with no plates over $8, which includes the cost of your bottomless cup of coffee.  They have breakfast pizza, the best breakfast sandwich in Pittsburgh (the sausage eggstasy sandwich, with two sausage patties, scrambled eggs, cheese, and a lovely bun), and something cleverly titled the 'hangover helper,' which has all the breakfast meat you could ask for, plus beer-battered pancakes.  (PS, it's not just for hangovers, it's also enjoyable post-half-marathon, as we discovered this May!)  The prices at Fuel & Fuddle are so reasonable, even before half-price time starts, and they've stayed pretty much the same since I first started going back in 2001.  They have a great beer selection, if you're into that sort of thing (they even have a beer club where you can attempt to drink 100+ different varieties for a chance at having your name on a little plaque on the wall).  I highly recommend the nachos - this is the thing that brings us back late at night many a time.  They're baked in the brick ovens with real cheese melted right on top, and big chunks of juicy tomatoes strewn throughout.  You can even add chili to the nachos for a little more bite!  Other great menu items include the pizzas (also baked in the brick ovens, and personal-sized, although you may have a piece or two left to take home with you) and the grilled psychedelic, their portabella mushroom sandwich.  The dive diner fries are crispy, perfectly-seasoned waffle fries, and they come on a plate big enough to feed the full party at your table.  Some notes: during the school year (Sept - beginning of May), crowds can be bad at half-price.  If you're over 21, my advice is to get there shortly before (they won't seat anyone for just half-price until 11 itself) and order your drink.  The awesome waitstaff will wait to put your food order in until the clock hits 11, and then you won't be so pressed to find a seat.  There is a small section of the menu that is not half-price, but it's clearly labeled so you're aware.    Brunch is 11-2 on Sundays, and on Steeler game days especially, it can get crowded.  We always try to get there just after 11 to get a table.  Downstairs, they have a large seating section that can accommodate groups.  I hosted the NaNoWriMo kick-off party there one year, and they put up with us bringing our laptops while enjoying our brunch.  Just call in advance if you know you're having a huge party (I know Pitt has also hosted writing program reading events here from time to time).  Parking is the only truly chancey thing about this place, but they're right on a bus line, and if you live in Oakland or the surrounding areas, just walk over.  You're guaranteed to want to eat a lot, so mightaswell get your exercise in ahead of time :)",

    "text": "I've been coming here since my Pitt days back in '98, and no matter how far I travel this remains one of my favorites.  I live in NYC now, and I go to Fuel EVERY visit! GET THE PIZZAS!!! The flying buffalo recipe changed since I had it last year, which is a shame. However, it's still undeniably one of the best pizzas you can get. I always intend to save half of it for later, but alas it is IMPOSSIBLE! Sadly, in New York their chicken on pizzas is needlessly fried, so I can only get this when I'm in town (or at Spak for the vegetarian version). Pound for pound I'd put this up against many of the New York great pizzas, just depending on what mood you're in.   The brie is also sublime, I think this was the dish that opened my eyes to the world and all of the food treasures it had to offer!  Finally, and with regret, I lament the disappearance of the catfish sandwich. Topped with a spicy jelly and mayo it sounds awful, but still haunts my dreams for its balance and excellence. PLEASE BRING IT BACK!!!",

    "text": "Stopped in for happy hour on a Thursday night around 5pm. Wasn't overly crowded. They had a couple different games on TV screen around the bar area. Draft beers were half off and they had a selection of about 10 different ones to choose from. The styles were diverse from hefeweizens to IPAs to sours. Many of what they had on tap was local, always a good sign. The bartender was fine with me trying a few samples before making my selection, again, always a good sign.   There was a lot of dark wood and the lighting was pretty low, especially because it is on a side street and didn't get a lot of natural light. Seemed like a local hangout. Cool place.",

My friends and I got the Fire-Baked Brie ($6), Skinny Dip ($6), Sweet Potato Fries ($2.5), and a beer each ($4 - $5).   The Fire-Baked Brie was way too sweet.. the \"drizzle of honey\" was more like a \"waterfall of honey\"! However, the brie itself was good. I normally hate the skin of brie, but I really liked this one because of the dough and crunch! The Skinny Dip was good and just the right amount of spicy and flavorful. You can actually taste the chicken in it! Be careful with this one though because it is very filling. The Sweet Potato Fries were standard, although again just a bit too sweet.  Although the food wasn't perfect, for the late night prices, Fuel and Fuddle is definitely worth it, has good enough flavors (although in exchange for healthiness, of course), and a great place to hang out with friends. I would come back again for late night, but I don't think I would ever stop by during normal hours for the normal prices.",

    "text": "Fuel and Fuddle has some great deals and some pretty good food. The quinoa veggie burger is cooked well. The sweet potato fries are very good, but the regular fries aren't quite crispy enough. I would recommend substituting your regular fries for all sweet potato fries for $1 extra. The pizza is good too.  The sweet potato bread pudding is amazing. It is the perfect texture, and it is huge. You definitely have to split it. The brownie sundae is super sweet, rich and delicious.   I have had great experiences with servers, and my order is rarely messed up even when they don't write down my complicated burger combination.    Late-night deals are great, but in my opinion you can get better food at The Porch for similar prices during normal hours. The atmosphere of Fuel and Fuddle is what keeps me coming back. It is a fun place to chill and hang out with friends. I recommend it for late-night deals any time!",

It's so cramped that one person has to sit facing the rest of the tables. We moved ourselves over a table because the restaurant was not busy at all. We ordered drinks, which were pretty good, but I was disappointed that happy hour only consisted of half off draft beers. There wasn't any liquor or food specials available for people who do not drink beer unfortunately.   I ordered a blackened chicken wrap, and I could not have been more disappointed with it. The chicken was EXTREMELY dry, which makes me think it was sitting in a container all day. The wrap also had romaine lettuce in it... which people aren't supposed to be consuming. I was charged $1 for cheddar cheese and $0.50 for balsamic dressing that I received half way through the meal.   Overall, the restaurant was crowded, uninviting, and very over priced for the quality! Our bill was $45 for two lousy meals and two drinks each. I would have definitely preferred to go to Stack'd down the road, and I will stick to Stack'd in the future!",

I went for the half off menu which starts at 11. In the past, it's been really busy during this time and there was typically a wait. But during this visit, we were sat immediately.  First off, they have a pretty extensive beer list which I appreciate, including Victory beers. We treated ourselves to Golden and Sour Monkey. As for food, we couldn't decide on just one thing so we both got two. It's important to point out that during the late night menu when you get two items, you have to eat half in order to take it home with you! I think this is a pretty fair rule.  I ordered the chicken caesar salad along with the chipotle polka. The chipotle polka is one of my favorite items on the menu. I mean spicy pierogies, how can you go wrong with that? It's so delicious and hard to pass up. My boyfriend ordered the wings and the hog heaven sandwich. The wings were a little skimpy in our opinion but they were half off so it wasn't a huge deal. The hog heaven on the other hand was amazing. It's a huge sandwich and is perfect for someone who loves pulled pork and bacon. Also, the mix of russet and sweet potato fries was a nice compliment. We were both pretty pleased with our meals and will definitely be back sooner rather than later!",

I was pretty disappointed by the chicken quesadilla. It was bland and had very little chicken and filling. The sweet potato fries, although not the best I've had, and the smashed potatoes were satisfying! All sides were $3  Great for large groups. Very casual, college environment (in the heart of Pitt's campus)",

Just about every time I visit I order something new to try with the help of their knowledgeable bartenders.   It's dark and gives off a bit of a moody feel, but that is awesome when it is crazy hot outside and you're trying to escape the sun's death rays. So far the food has been sort of hit-or-miss for me. The first time I visited, even though I was definitely having a good time, I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and took about two bites. It was terrible. Even the waitress admitted that it definitely was not one she liked, and she was nice enough to take it off the bill for me, though I did not ask.   Their meatloaf is killer, and I highly recommend ordering it with a side of sweet potato fries. In fact, if you aren't very hungry you should order a half-and-half mix of their regular and sweet potato fries. The fries are soooo good here. I wonder how many times I can put fries into this one paragraph ...  I have also had a few of their pizzas and only had one bad experience: their margherita pizza. I'm pretty sure it was just the cook that particular visit, but it was just awful. Not just flavor-wise, though it was more of a cheese pizza than a margherita. I picked up a slice and all of my toppings fell through the back. No joke. The bottom of the entire pizza was so soggy, it couldn't hold together. Which also makes for an unpleasant experience in your mouth, in case you were unaware.  All in all, I would recommend a visit to Fuel & Fuddle if you are in the area. Be careful in regards to parking - finding a space on the street is usually impossible and a quarter will only get you 7 & 1/2 minutes in the meter.",

The best part, they give you half sweet potato fries half regular fries... you get the best of both worlds... the sweet potato fries were fried perfectly to a nice crispiness.

I had been looking forward to their jerk chicken wings and they are now using a new sauce that doesn't have nearly as good of definition or flavor. They brought all of our food out at once (appetizers, soup, salads, main dishes) and some of it was cold. This happened because our waitress was sweeping the floor for ten minutes when our food was up. Generally the only items we had that were good was the house salad and the sweet potato fries. The chicken chili had potential but it was barely warm. To boot the restaurant was not very clean when we were there. The bathroom smelled, both toilets were clogged, and there was no toilet paper.

    "text": "Fuel & Fuddle strikes me as one of those establishments that stirs sentimental feelings from patrons who were regular visitors during their college days in Pittsburgh.   Either that or it's the funky, brick-walled, logo-laden atmosphere.   I'm all about the food, ya peanuts, and aside from a rather accomplished pizza, I came away unimpressed.   Kay, myself, and I friend who lives in the vicinity were to catch a concert ('Again?' I hear you groan...) at the Petersen Events Center and of course needed that pre-show bite to carry us through the proceedings. After having remembered that a fellow Yelper or two has mentioned that F&F is a favorite dining spot of theirs, I thought we might be in for some good grubbin'.   As I wrote earlier, I did savor our crudely named C'mon Iwana Leya Hawaiian Pizza. Succulent, lightly brackish grilled ham played off the juicy, caramelized pineapple like accomplished twin guitarists, the stage being a thin crust that was akin to a dusty, toasted pita with its union of chew, crispness, and char. Fresh, silken mozzarella blanketed the affair while a house-made bourbon-infused BBQ sauce brought richly sweet, intoxicating undertones. Dark Paradise would have been a more fitting title for this gripping story of a pizza/appetizer.   I came very close to ordering the Alligator Stew, but its description conjured images of me not finishing what read like a Shepherd's Pie that might have been stingy with the armored lizard in question. Translation: I thought it might be too filling and lacking in gator.  Nah, I wanted something a little lighter.   So whaddya know? I went with a Havana Burger.   And I began to wish I'd been more adventurous.   I like Cuban sandwiches, and I am obsessed with burgers, so it stood to reason that I should have been pleased with this handheld hybrid.  Instead, aside from the above average regular and sweet potato fries (a helping of each is apparently included with each burger), the overall entree left me chilly, especially when one considers F&F's chuck, sirloin, and brisket blend. Yet that 1/2 pound patty, ordered medium-rare, was cooked medium, creating dryness where there should not have been. Crud, Eat 'N Park's Superburger is juicer than this was. Also unforgivably arid were the ham and pulled pork. Provolone and dill pickle chips had marginal involvement as did whole grain mustard and roasted garlic mayo, which were plopped in the center of the burger itself without being spread about. While not a deplorable burger, it wasn't worth the boat ride from Miami, know what I mean?  Dessert was a toss-up between the Sweet Potato Cheesecake, Nutter Butter Pie, and The Big Ass Brownie. F&F doesn't make the cheesecake in-house, so that was quickly dismissed even if it's probably very good (I'll go to Enrico Biscotti Co, if I want to try it). The Nutter Butter Pie was promising, but once more trepidation caused me to order the brownie. My readers will know that hot fudge brownie sundaes are arguably my preferred dessert over them all, but this one was not nearly as \"gooey\" as F&F states on the menu. Old \"Big-Ass\" was more like a large cube of warm chocolate cake topped with walnuts, chocolate syrup, caramel, and vanilla ice cream with some raspberry (?) puree acting as a clever, artistic garnish (see my photo). Moderately tasty it was even if the cake (this was no brownie) wasn't as moist as I would have liked. Still, I craved something fudgy, something dense, something dripping with molten ooze. It wasn't to be.   Nonetheless, the service was fine, and environs were welcoming enough. Perhaps my ordering instincts shorted out when I came here. Restaurants with many fetching options sometimes do that to me.",

I like them.\" And she continues to repeat this two more times, and me having to confirm this.

I couldn't understand the difficulty in why she had to repeat this more than twice and I had to reconfirm this more than twice. Is she judging me? I didn't understand.   Still confused as to why I have to repeat myself four times, I go on to say that I have ordered this byo burger before several times, and there weren't any issues with the previous orders -- the waitstaff took my order without a problem and the burger came out fine (really good) in the past.

    "text": "Visits: Once, for lunch.  Food: I'm not a pub crawler, and I don't really like pub food, so my opinion comes with a shaker of salt. To me, it was standard American food, done bland and soggy - the fried cod sandwich was pretty flavorless, and so was the sauce that came with it (it was orange but tasted like salty mayo with no heat). Maybe I ordered the wrong thing - maybe they're no good with fried fish. But if they're no good with it, why offer it at all? The portion size was generous, but I honestly felt like I was eating fish cardboard on a bun. The fries were all soggy, despite being fully inundated with oil, to the point where the sweet potato fries tasted more like oil than sweet potato. Two points off.  Atmosphere: It works, I guess. I honestly think the decor is kind of confusing. I don't think it knows if it wants to be a restaurant or a bar - the bar area is a standard bar, but the booth and table seating screams 50s restaurant. The two don't really match, especially since the booth/table seating is significantly shorter than the bar (which is directly adjacent, so it's not like it's offset). One point off.  Service: No complaints here. Prompt and friendly.  Cost/Benefit: The portion size was pretty good for the price. The quality may not be, but they don't skimp, and I'm not going to ding twice for the same thing.  I rated a similar bar/restaurant combo in Boston (Sunset Grill and Tap). I gave it four stars even though I didn't enjoy it, because it hit all the right buttons for people who want that kind of thing. This, however, wasn't enjoyable for me, had memorably bad food, didn't give the impression that it would be a fun bar atmosphere for that kind of audience, and was overpriced. I'm guessing the good reviews come from the wide variety of drinks, which I didn't have. But if that's what it's for, why bother having a restaurant at all?  Also, this is a random side note, but I hate the menu. It's \"trendy\" as hell, and makes you read the descriptions just to know what the main part of the food is for half the items. \"bat out of hell\" = meatloaf. \"bada bing\" = sausage. Whyyyy??? I don't necessarily mind gimmicky names, but I'd like to at least know what the main foodstuff in the menu item is at a glance.",

For pizza I think it is great, for items like the crab cakes, meh, not so much.    Most meals are served with a mix of regular french fries and sweet potato fries.  The prices are a little more than what you'd pay for a typical lunch (plan on about $12-$15 for a meal and a soda) but worth it.  It gets crowded FAST and there is limited seating and a small bar.

We walked in and loved the decor and set up of the place.  Our server was very nice. She answered our questions and quickly got our drinks. My husband ordered the Moby Dick sandwich and I ordered the Chicken Pesto pizza.  The Moby Dick is a fish sandwich. The piece of fish is 3 times the size of the bun. It's fried in a great southern style coating. It's not the type of batter you find on Pittsburgh fish sandwiches-thick and greasy. There is also coleslaw on the sandwich. It tastes good and gives a great crunch. The best part (besides the coating) is the tarter sauce. We are pretty sure it is house made. It's the best tarter sauce I've ever had. It was thick and creamy and had great flavor. The sandwich is served with a mix of regular fries and sweet potato fries.  My pizza was the size of a dinner plate. It has a thin crust and is baked in a brick oven. It had a base of olive oil, followed by a layer of pesto. Then it was topped with a creamy cheese, pieces of grilled chicken and tomatoes. One bite and I was hooked. I liked the thin crust and the crispy edges.  We enjoyed our dining experience from start to finish. We we go back soon and take our friends.",

My friends and I got the skinny dip (buff chix dip) which was amazing, the smashed potato pizza which was also amazing and someone got the jive burger (turkey burger) which again was really good. Lao the sweet potato fries are a must try!!!",

I ordered the Havana Burger medium rare. I'd prefer my burger be under than over but this was raw...charred on the outside and totally raw on the inside. It was inedible. Unfortunate because it smelled really good. We also ordered the beer muscles. Another risky delivery order but it came quickly so I had high hopes. The flavor was good but there were 9 unopened mussels...NINE!!  When you have a pound of mussels and you can't even eat NINE of them, you're still hungry!  Paid for a lot of inedible food today and that sucks.   UPDATE:  I wrote an email to Fuel and Fuddle about my experience and they promptly apologized and are sending a gift card. I'm all about 2nd chances!",

My husband and I were here with two of our friends and although everyone else's food was a miss, mine was a total hit! I ordered the Smashed Potato pizza and it was so darn good. It's like a pierogi pizza but better. The bacon was salty, the lettuce added freshness, tomatoes were sweet, onions added some zing and then topped with a tangy and creamy ranch dressing. Such well-balanced flavors. Unfortunately, I was the only one to really enjoy my meal. My counterparts ordered meatloaf, a meatloaf sandwich and a crab cake sandwich. Folks, don't get the meatloaf here (and I don't know why it was picked by two members of our party). The meatloaf basically was a grilled salisbury steak. The crab cake sandwich was okay, but you'll have better. I'd say this is a good place to drink and to order drinking food (like pizza), but don't venture and get something you wouldn't normally drink with.",

The $6 menu after 11pm includes pizza, wings, sandwiches, etc. Their sweet potato fries are the best I have ever had, but what I love most about these fries is they offer a combo of sweet potato fries and regular fries which truly is the best of both worlds. Even without the late-night deal, Fuel is still affordable and delicious. I'd recommend the Smashed Potato Pizza, the Hog Heaven (pulled pork sandwich), the Carolina Gold wings, and the Steak and Potatoes salad.",

    "text": "One things I miss about being a college student in Pittsburgh is this place. It's hard to find any other city where you get half price and delicious food in large quantities this late at night.  Late night starts from 11pm-1am when the kitchen closes. During this time, mostly everything is half off except for some of the big platters, seafood dishes, and drinks.  Recommendations: Wings - messy but so good, I always go with the standard buffalo but the other flavors are great too, wings are large, crispy, and juicy.  Dip sticks - Definitely pay that $1 extra and add the mozz. Great rosemary flatbread and marinara sauce. Cheese makes it even better.  Roll-a-fatty - Kind of like a calzone but better because it's half off and you get extra marinara sauce to dip.  Pizzas - A little bigger than a personal pan, but easily finished by one person. I like the Classic Maggie and all the ones with lots of MEAT. My friends always get the Smashed Potato, but I've never liked it since it tastes likes salad on a pizza.  I've never been here not during late night so no idea how it is during normal hours, but it's always been crowded every time I've been here.It's especially crowded on Thurs-Sat. because of all the college students. Don't be surprised with up to an hour's wait. Best time to go though is to get there either around 10:30pm to wait in line for late night to begin, or around 12-12:30pm right before their kitchen closes.",

The waitress was weirded out it seemed cause none of my party of four wanted any of their damn beers.  Chicken is my beer,  - blackened Chicken Wrap was AMAZING. - The fries that came with it was LEGENDARY. They give you half regular fries and half sweet potato. Their sweet potato fries are the best I ever had. They are seasoned well and melt in your mouth.  Like I always say if you don't need  ketchup for the fries to taste good, you have an excellent fry.  Just like if you don't need beer to appear exciting or humorous, you have an excellent personality.  My party had some other stuff that I don't remember but they loved it. Let's just say we enjoyed our food hangover afterwords. It's like the itis but we're not sleepy.  The atmosphere was great dim and grungy.",

The sandwich had nothing of substance besides the huge roll of bread it came on. I took off the singular shriveled piece of lettuce that came with the blackened burger and ate my sweet potato fries instead.   Now, that is something that you should go for! The sweet potato fries are perfectly crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. They aren't dripping with oil like other places so I don't feel like a total glutton.   I remember coming here my freshman year for their half off and ordering their famous mashed potato pizza.

    "text": "Fuel and fuddle is always a great place to eat.  We went there after we saw the wait at Pamela's Diner.  But we weren't disappointed in our second choice.   They had Great Lakes Christmas Ale on draft which is amazing!  There were five of us and we we were seated right away.  Our server was very nice and attentive.  Our table ordered the smashed potato pizza, buffalo chicken pizza, and BBQ chicken pizza.  The smashed potato and buffalo chicken were amazing but the BBQ was disappointing.  However, the other food, atmosphere, and beer choice were excellent!",

They participate in half off, which a lot of local restaurants do. after a certain time, food on their menu goes half off. Its a great way for you to get a late night bite after studying 2 blocks away in hillman or in the cathedral. Their pizzas are great too. With all of their food they use great ingredients which comes out in their food. i would recommend this to all",

    "text": "This is a pretty decent place for bar food.  They have a nice chicken breast sandwich, and oversize nachos.  I have found after eating many a lunch here while I was working nearby, that the quality of the food is a bit inconsistent.  The fries are decent and you can ask for a garlic aioli for them.  My wife would probably give them an additional star because she really like the sweet potato fries.  One good thing about this place is that it is great for a mixed group with lots of food idiosyncracies.  There are a decent number of veggie options, e.g., a mushroom sandwich.",

    "text": "I had the steak burger ($9) and it was quite good. They actually made it medium rare (I've had trouble getting anything rarer than medium in Pittsburgh when I order medium rare). It comes on a long soft, roll- it's definitely different, but palatable nonetheless. The burger had a nice char on the outside and was still juicy on the inside. It came with a mix of regular fries and sweet potato and those were a nice touch. I had a brown ale of sorts ($4.50) and it was not too malty and not too heavy. Service was quick and the staff was helpful.",

Apple thing for dessert was huge. Like a pizza with 3 scoops of ice cream. Solid beer selection. Sandwiches all looked really good. People next to us had buffalo chicken dip - smelled horrible, but looked interesting.",
