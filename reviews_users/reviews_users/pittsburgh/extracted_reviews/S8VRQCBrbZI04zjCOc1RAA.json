And if you're thirsty you can get Sprite and coke made with real sugar (hecho en Mexico!!) these are much better and cheaper than the crunchy over priced nonsense from chipotle.",

    "text": "Can we talk about how good these Tacos were?  I mean, seriously, just for a second?  Ok. Here's the skinny - You go into the Las Palmas Mexican Market, where you pay $2.50 per taco and hope they understand enough of you English to complete the transaction. You then come out to the street and get said taco(s). You then top them at the toppings bar (that was amazing), afterwards you ascend to a higher plane of taco existence.  On a crowded street in Pittsburgh. A sunny Sunday afternoon. Standing around a tree. This was the environment in which I had the best taco I have pretty much ever had. It was perfect though and through. i had one chicken and peppers, the other steak peppers and onions. They were perfect. I will be going back many more times.  I totally took the YELPers' collective advice on this one and was not disappointed. If you like eating amazing tacos on a sidewalk, its 5/5 - would taco again.",

Not really because depending on what part of town myself in I would take either.  You know how taco stands work right? Pick your meat carnitas, chicken, or steak. Then choose your veggies.

Similar to the Brookline location, tacos made on the street in front of the market.  So YUM!  The Pitt students are loving it.  $2 taco with corn tortillas.  Appears to be the same selection of meats and salsa's and toppings as the original.  Ordered two tacos, a carne asada and  a pollo.  The carne asada was just coming off the grill and was delicious.  The pollo was in a warmer and was a little tough and probably in the warmer to long.  The salsa's are great!  Las Palmas does have a facebook page.",

    "text": "If you're looking for delicious, authentic Mexican food in Oakland, look no further than Las Palmas.  Despite their inexpensiveness, the ingredients are fresh and plentiful.  For a mere $5, you get two tacos made of corn tortilla filled with the meat of your choice (or potatoes, if you're vegetarian), and access to a toppings bar brimming with pico de gallo, cilantro, and salsas of all spice levels that you can slather on your creation.  I came here a couple months ago on a Friday with a friend when it was raining cats and dogs.  In spite of the rain, it became clear within half a block of here that the guys who work here were grilling up goodness.  I ordered the chicken and the pork (carnitas?), and put pico, green salsa, and guac on mine.  The guys who work the grill kindly gave me a bag to help us carry our tacos and shield them from the rain.  The chicken was delicious--tender and moist--and the guac was thick and creamy, and the tortilla shell added a nice crisp crunch.  The pork was a little salty, but was still good.  I washed it down with a bottle of pineapple Jarritos, whose sweetness served as a foil for the savory goodness of the tacos.  They were so good, there were no words exchanged between my friend and I as we greedily gobbled them up.  You know you're onto something delicious when conversation takes a backseat to savoring.  If you're hungry for authentic Mexican goodness, it awaits you past Chipotle and Qdoba a couple of blocks down Atwood.  Go ahead, walk those extra couple of blocks--it'll help you burn off some calories, and your stomach will thank you.",

Plus, they are cheap and really large for an authentic taco experience (meaning normally traditional tacos are tiny little things, but these are huge and yet still done in the traditional manner for all other intents and purposes). I haven't had tacos anywhere near this good since moving back from NYC, and now I'm obsessed. Yesterday after a long bike ride that landed us at REI in South Side Works, we decided we needed these tacos, and went the extra few miles (up hill) to get them. Mind you, he was out of all the usually choices (carnitas, barbecoa, stewed chicken, carne asada, etc...) and only had some sort of 'whatever was left over' mixture of chicken chunks, pork remnants, and select veggies - I was skeptical... but it still was amazing! I've always found the True sign of a good cook is being able to make the crappiest ingredients still into something delicious, and this dude does. Seriously, good stuff. It's worth braving the throngs of coeds ;)",

You pay inside at the register and hand the grill master your \"ticket\" then you order your meats. There is also a condiment bar outside, but it is uncovered and exposed to the elements, which I thought was a little odd. Not the most sanitary of places but that is part of the experience. The al pastor and carnitas were fantastic. Their hot sauce ranges from mild to pretty spicy. There is also free guac. Would recommend Las Palmas to anyone looking for that authentic Mexican taco experience. There are no tables or seats so be prepared to eat in or on your car. 2.50 each taco, good deal!",

Every year when the weather starts getting nice we head over a few times a month (typically on Fridays for long lunches).  When you first arrive you'll go inside.  I recommend getting a drink (Jumex is my preferred variety), but depending on your salsa choice is not necessary.  You then check out with the cashier in the front and tell them how many tacos you want.  Two is enough for most people, and three is a good sized portion if you're really hungry.  At $2.50/taco, two tacos and a drink comes to $6 even.  You'll then head back outside and wait by the grill for your turn in line.  Depending on when you show up and what's currently cooking you might be there upwards of ten minutes waiting.  It gets rough, but it's worth it.  My favorite tacos are the steak and the chicken ones, but you can't go wrong.  After that you pile on the salsas and other toppings.  I will warn you many of the salsas are hotter than they look.  I stick with the guacamole cream and it's perfect.  The one thing to be aware of is that they lack vegetarian options on a consistent basis.  I've been there once when they had veggie options (a potato taco), but I haven't seen it or other choices since.  If you're veggie, this may not be your place.  Seating is non-existent.  That's okay.  Take your to go container and make the trek over to the picnic tables over at Schenley Plaza.",

You pay inside and get a slip with the amount of tacos you want, and hand that to the cook outside. He tosses on fresh corn tortillas and grills them while you decide what meats you want. I usually go with a chicken and chorizo taco since they have those at all times, but their al pastor and carnitas are amazing if they happen to have them when you go. Be careful with the salsas and always get them in the little to-go containers if you haven't had them before, some are insanely hot.

And trust me, they are super generous with the meat and you can go crazy with the toppings, so just two tacos can make a pretty satisfying lunch.   My favorite is the steak and onions taco. The meat is fully seasoned and the double tortilla is nice and warm. Be careful with the different salsa though because some can be extremely spicy. Double check the spice level before you slather on the salsa.    Overall, I highly recommend Las Palmas as a Mexican option for a mid afternoon snack or a quick lunch.",

    "text": "Great street tacos.   There's a somewhat rotating list of fillers, with at least chicken always there. Try the lamb if you get a chance. You order your tacos, go in and pay then come back for your order. Wait time varies, but it's never seemed unreasonable. Beware the fixings: some of them are very, very hot. Get to know them in cautious quantities before you start heaping stuff on: appearances are deceiving. The (fried) tortillas are kept in a steamer: this may work against you during slow periods. (They're fine, except that they get very soft; I'm personally ok with that).  I've stopped there for a quick one while biking by, and we've driven there to pick up dinner for a group of people. Always great, once you learn how the place works. (And do leave something in the tip jar.)",

Like, as someone conditioned to paying extra for guac at Chipotle, I'm pretty happy with unlimited amounts of slightly more goopy guac here.  - Each taco is only $2.50. But let's be real, the base price is more like $5 for two tacos because who comes here and just gets one taco?   Pay inside first, hand the receipt to the guy doing the grilling, and then enjoy your tacos, you lucky person you.",

You should know a couple of things before heading here. 1) The money exchange takes place in the little grocery store behind the taco stand. Roll up to checkout, and let the cashier know you would like dos or maybe even tres tacos. 2) They take card or cash, so no need to go to the ATM. 3) Some of the meat chefs don't speak English, just know your numbers in Spanish and how to say chicken. Also your por favor and gracias.   My personal favorite meats are the chicken, steak and onion, and chorizo. However, I've had almost all of them, and they are literally all the best thing I ever ate. So, ball's in your court there. If they have ribeye, that is also insanely good. As far as the topping situation goes, the have a small bar stocked with tomatoes, pico, grilled peppers, and a delicious avocado cream sauce that you're going to drench those babies in. Alas, no cheese on the topping bar for you, gringo.  Also, every single one of the salsas is too hot for my palate, which can usually withstand a fair dose of Mexican heat. Proceed with caution, and utilize those little sauce cups up top. Happy taco-ing!",

We wandered through the Mexican grocery store to be wowed by the many kinds of hot sauce, and then we ordered two tacos at $2.50/taco.  I ordered a chorizo and a pork taco, but the chorizo was the major winner.  The pork was really fatty and greasy so I actually didn't enjoy that taco and would not recommend it.  However, the toppings bar is the best thing ever.  There were plenty of different salsas, tomatoes, cilantro, limes, pico, and guac.  I love toppings so this was the highlight of Las Palmas for me.

    "text": "Being a Mexican-American visitor from San Diego in sunny Cali (where there's a Mexican place every other half mile) and a constant visitor to Tijuana, there seem to be few places here in Pittsburgh that don't try to be \"Americanized\" Mexican places. But with this place, I can definitely say Pittsburgh can be proud to have a place that provides to them the deliciousness that is authentic street tacos. Street tacos normally come in small tortillas (common for Tijuana street cart tacos, with a few here and there that try to be different). For 2.50 here though, you get a more filling and larger taco with different choices of carne o pollo, cilantro, cebolla, sal, limon y rica salsa en dos tortillas de maiz!  Sorry, the enthusiasm got the better of me. Seriously though, this place really provides a great choice for authentic Mexican tacos for those southwestern transplants and Latin people who miss a little bit of home. And the locals here in Pittsburgh can enjoy what we've had for a good part of our lives. It may not be the perfect taco, but it might be as good as you can get here (and it's very good!).",

    "text": "NEWS UPDATE: LAS PALMAS OAKLAND REOPENED AS OF 12/12/16.   I consider myself a renaissance man with numerous interests, but particularly I'm a devotee to a life enamored with tacos. It has been my quest to find the titular taco king in the burgh, and I think Las Palmas is the recipient of this prestigious honor.   Food: While Edgar's and Las Palmas can be heralded as Pittsburgh's most \"authentic\" Mexican taquerias, Las Palmas takes #1 on the taco rankings for a number of reasons (and why I visit this establishment 2-3 times a week). The corn tortilla is doubly layered, fried just before your taco is prepared. Meat choices range include chicken, steak, barbacoa, pork and chilis (my favorite), chorizo, and occasionally lengua. The meats are all well seasoned and succulent, so there is no wrong choice. Where Las Palmas wins over Edgar's is the salsa and toppings selection. The spread includes pico de gallo, tomatoes, onions, chopped cilantro, seared chilis, and an airy avocado sauce. The best part are the salsas, which administer concentrations of capsaicin second to none. Note: I did not include the grocery component of the establishment as part of my review. However I've always found decent produce and a wide variety of imported hot sauces at LP  Service: Don't expect speedy or inviting service. You must purchase tacos at the register inside ($2.50 per taco, no tax, also separate from any purchase you make from the market side). The cashier will hand you a note with the number of tacos you ordered on it, after which you may join the lucky souls in line who about to embark on a journey to taco nirvana. Hand the grillmaster your note and let him know what type of meat you want on your tacos. The cooks often love chatting with the customers, especially if you speak Spanish well  Overall: Las Palmas provides an authentic taco experience with no frills. This restaurant is perfect for a cheap and quick lunch, unusual and fresh idea for a food date, or even a late night snack. After their most recent run-in with the health inspectors, they even cleaned up the place if you're worried about sanitation. Look no further than Las Palmas for the best taco in Pittsburgh",

    "text": "WRITTEN BASED OFF EXPERIENCES BEFORE LAS PALMAS' SANITATION ISSUES: THOSE ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED AND IT HAS REOPENED.  EDIT 2/27/16: A friend of mine ate here yesterday (this is after they reopened). He's currently experiencing symptoms of food poisoning.   While my opinion may be unpopular, I am confident in claiming that I don't think Las Palmas offers that great of a taco. My multiple experiences here haven't been all that spectacular: it just doesn't live up to the hype. To start, I'm not a big fan of corn tortillas. They place their tortilla on the griddle to warm before your consumption, but this dries the tortilla. Corn tortillas do not a good job of reabsorbing the oils and sauces from the contents of the taco, unlike flour tortillas, which typically do this quite well.  Furthermore, each time I've eaten there, the condiment/salsa cart has been out of salsas, certain veggies and guacamoles, and the meats have been too dry. I think this attests to the lack of care for quality and sanitation that closed the store for a period of time at the end of Summer '16. When entering the convenience store, i could see how poorly maintained the produce sections were. True, I have not been to the location since its reopening, so this observation may be dated. I'll have to stop in again to reassess this.  Bottom line, Las Palmas is, by popular belief, a great place to grab a taco. It's quick, cheap and favored by many. There are changes I think could be made to the presentation/quality of their tacos that would make this market/stand far more appealing. I need to go back and try their tacos to see if their quality has improved since they've opened. When I do, I'll be sure to reconsider my rating of this Oakland staple",

Probably 6 different salsas, an avocado that was to die for, and peppers and limes for toppings. That was probably my favorite part. Loved the variety and versatility.

    "text": "As I get back into the review swing of things, the first place that comes to mind in the Burgh is this joint. Having eaten here numerous times now, I can give it my legit stamp of approval, and this review hah.  I am enamored, by the whole experience of eating here. See, I lived in Mexico many moons ago and eating street tacos was an ADL - activity of daily living (common medical abbreviation). So yea I get a dose of nostalgia here, but their food is the reason I keep coming back and what I think about after I leave. As in previous reviews, the options are standard- chicken, bistec, barbacoa, pork. What they do that's special, that I haven't had elsewhere, is that they season their meat quite substantially using more than just salt and pepper. Their chicken meat is made with caramelized onions. Their barbacoa is ready to eat with a plate of rice if you choose- it's that flavorful on its own. You see the pics of their condiments, which are all you can add. There's the salsas of various kinds, including avocado and habanero (which is not dumbed down at all!). There's the fresh chopped veg toppings and grilled chiles if you're lucky. The final product of your ultimate choice is incredibly delicious, not to mention filling. I've had 2 tacos and been full, 3 and really full.  You pay for however many tacos you want inside the grocery store, $2.50 each, the cashier will give you a ticket of your quantity. You take it outside and hand it to the kind sir who will prepare your bounty. You can eat right there on plastic disposable plates covered in wax paper- they use plastic bags in MX. Or take it home, which I've done as well, and enjoy a less warm but still delish meal. The tacos are large, 2 of them fill a plate. It's an incredible meal at the cheapest of prices. The grocery store has authentic goods from their homeland, mainly food items but they also carry fresh meat and pinatas, just in case.  So back to being en enamorado- to eat these incredible tacos on the street, with paisanos, listening to tejano or mariachi tunes, for me can't be beat.",

Choice of Steak/ground beef/Chicken/Chicken Fajitas with mix veg/Carnitas/shredded Beef! Tried all except ground beef..they were all to die for! The best part was they had a whole condiment stations where they had fresh tomatoes, onions, cilantro, mild salsa, habanero, spicy and hot salsa!  It's hidden in the hood! Right outside of a Mexican convenient store! So a landmark in finding the place!  The make it fresh right in front of u! And at $2 each, u can't go wrong!!

The stand is right outside the Mexican convenience store. So if the habanero sauce is too hot for you, you can go in to get some Mexican coke. They also have these guava and other flavored drinks that are quite nice.",

    "text": "Do you hear that? That's the sound of every broke college student squealing in ecstasy over TACOS FOR $2.50. Come hungry, because these are filling. You can order as many tacos as you want (though three makes for a heavy meal), with as many toppings at you want. Let me repeat, FOR $2.50. I want to emphasize that the appeal does not lie only in the price. I'm unashamed to say Las Palmas has made up a considerable part of my diet for the past year, and I've consistently been impressed by the freshness and quality of the ingredients.   I suggest mixing it up - try a different meat for each taco base (there's usually a selection of 5-6), and challenge your taste buds with their range of salsas and fresh toppings. Brace yourself, they mean business with the spicy salsas.   Warning - It's a stand, not a restaurant, and offers no seating, so you'll have to take your tacos on the go. But despite being covered by only a small awning, Las Palmas is opened year round. (Yes, even when Pittsburgh becomes an arctic wasteland.)   Overall: believe the hype. This place is the stuff of dreams.",

Rib eye is def the best quality option for your money, but if u order chicken of chorizo your gonna get a taco very full of meat. I never have to order more than 3 and I'm always full.  The avocado sauce(not sure of its real name) and pico goes on each of my tacos. Sometimes I use a small amount of the yellowish ghost pepper salsa but not always.

Las Palmas has everything from chicken to beef to barbacoa and I'm probably missing some options. It's $2.50 for a taco. $2.50?!?!?! Do you realize how ridiculous that is??? You walk up to the grill on the sidewalk and tell them what kind of meat you want. They then take raw meat, slap it on the grill, cook it in front of you, and then hand it to you in a corn tortilla. You then have the option of slathering as many different toppings on the tacos as you please.   I would say a meal is 2 tacos and they have really cool drinks inside to choose from. From coconut juice to various kinds of Mexican sodas.    As a student, I walked. And I can see it being a bit hard to find parking around there.   Las Palmas is my little piece of Los Angeles.

Thankfully, Las Palmas is here to save the day and provide the East End with excellent and inexpensive tacos.  This taco stand is just as amazing as the one in Brookline.  I recently went by a 50-degree late Sunday afternoon and there was quite the line.  The only downside is that there aren't any nearby benches, but if you can manage to wait for a few minutes, it's a quick walk to Schenley Park.  The store has a great selection of Mexican condiments, beverages, pastries, and fresh produce.  It's smaller than the store in Brookline, but would be a great place for students to shop--it's on par with what Groceria Merante is for Italian food.  PRO TIP: You pay for your tacos inside the store and then they give you a receipt to take outside.",

The tacos are $2.50 each and probably the best you'll find in a city that is not known for its Mexican cuisine. You can pile on as many toppings as you want. For a sweet treat, pick up some flan or tres leches cake in the store. Delicious! My only complaint is there's nowhere to sit, so you've got to either take the food home, walk over to Schenley Park, or eat it awkwardly while walking down the street. These tacos are so mouth-watering as to make the last option seem reasonable, so be careful -- especially with the hot sauce.",

First off as soon as I got here some of the sauces didn't have lids on them and had flies ALL over them, I thought this was pretty gross but decided to still get some tacos and just use a sauce that had a lid on it. I thought the sauces looked pretty gross but thought at least the guy is watching over the meat, then I see him get a phone call and touch his phone with the gloves he was wearing and then go back to touching the food. For some reason I decided to look the other way when it came to this, maybe because I was incredibly hungry and needed to eat something asap. To top it off I go inside and look at the pan dulce, thinking oh at least this is in the store and enclosed, then I see a fly... Followed by about 10 other flies landing on pretty much every piece of bread they had in there. This is absolutely disgusting on many levels, and I don't know if Pittsburgh just doesn't have many Mexican options but this is totally unacceptable and I don't know how this place has a good rating let alone decent reviews. I would give this place 0 stars if I could and am now hoping I don't get any type of food poisoning..",

But they encourage you to stand around a eat, and quite a lot of people do. If you want the tacos to go, you can package up all of the salsas too.  In the back of the store at the butcher, they even sell fresh chicharones. (They also have a variety of packaged ones). The one I got at the butcher was a piece bigger than my face!

For only $2 dollars a taco, it is well worth it. All the tacos are amazing, especially the potato taco. The ribeye taco is juicy and tender as well. With the large selection of salsas you can't go wrong. So so happy I finally found this place!",

    "text": "Really nice cheap food within walk of Carnegie Mellon and Pitt campus!!   These street tacos are served at the front of the Mexican grocery store. All of the tacos are $2 (not dirt cheap but they give you a nice-sized taco and lots of fixings).   The guy is continually cooking the meat on the grill in front of you while he pumps out tacos and the meat is really fresh. Tacos are served in two corn tortillas, which he also grills right in front of you. I highly endorse the ribeye steak taco--- a slab of beef instead of more traditional chopped-up meat, with really great flavor. The chorizo taco is pretty good also.  Even better, you put on your own toppings-- fresh pico, avocado-tomatillo salsa, red hot salsa, cilantro, onions, etc...  I loved this place and would go here really often if I lived in this neighborhood.",

But don't pass up the grocery itself! Their produce selection is cheap as chips (particularly in comparison to IGA); I purchased a mango, 4 limes, a grapefruit, a sack of onions, 3 avocados, and a tomato for approximately 10 dollars. Next time I pop in, I fully intend to sample some of their pastries- I do have a soft spot for conchas.",

Thankfully I read some reviews before heading over as I probably would have waited in line first, not realizing you have to go in and pay first.   I think my total time in line was 12 minutes, I went around 12:30 on a Tuesday... but now that I think about it... classes are done for the majority of students in the area so I'm not sure how the line is normally.   My favorite part about Las Palmas is the condiment bar... I LOVE cilantro!!!!! And guac!!!! I also love not having to pay extra for these things. Although it wouldn't have been terrible considering the tacos are only 2.50 each.   Only complaint is that I am short and was not able to really view the meats before selecting. But sadly I'm used to my height challenged-limitations. Perhaps a dry erase/chalk board with the days features?  Also, would like there to be more vegetarian options!   But all in all, seriously, this place is amazing, you will not be disappointed!",

They are probably a bit larger than what most people expect with generous portions of meat. They use 2 corn tortillas with each taco which is nice because you don't rip through them.   The chorizo is top notch (but naturally greasy) and if you're feeling bold try the red hot sauce or If you're insane the more orange habanero salsa (good luck!)",

You get a massive taco for $2.50! I was like \"shoot, I refuse to ever pay less than $5 bucks at a taco spot\" so I got 3 tacos. I think I would have done just fine with just one.   The tortillas that they use here are bigger than the usual palm-sized ones you find in other taco spots. And boy do they make sure to fill the sucker up! I had a hard time choosing which meat I wanted. Unfortunately for me, I didn't get our meat cooked upon request so I chose based on which looked the freshest. I got the carne asada, al pastor, and the fajita mix. Carne asada tasted a bit bland for me. Thankfully I got a little too happy at the toppings bar (as I always do) so the sauce covered it up. The al pastor was delicious! When you have grease running down your fingers, you know that's a tasty al pastor! The fajita mix was better than I thought it would taste. The onion & peppers definitely brought out a special charm in that taco.   I'm a slow eater; so with the size of the taco and massive toppings/sauce on it, it gets soggy fast. Have a fork handy in case your tortilla rips like mine. Also there is no place to eat your taco there. You gotta either find yourself a spot on the curb or prepare to use your car trunk. Las Palmas is smart. They get free promotion/advertisement with people standing around eating their tacos throughout the street. I had 3 random people come up to me and ask what I was eating.",

I have had six different tacos in total and each meat combination has been very flavorful and different in their own way. Their corn tortillas are spot on and their salsa/condiment table has a nice variety of different things, but be aware that some salsas are pretty darn spicy.  I would recommend getting one of their specialty sodas which pairs very nicely with their tacos on a hot day. You can not compare their pricing to any restaurant or even another taco stand as three tacos and a soda costs about $6 which is amazing.    The only reason that I give this place a 4 out of five is because of the cleanliness of the grill, stand itself and the salsa/condiment table. I have felt like I've taken a chance of getting sick each time I have eater here, but the food is worth the risk in my opinion. Maybe they could invest in some new equipment.",

Go inside and pay first then go outside and hand your ticket to the cook.

You get unlimited toppings (salsas, hot sauces, onions, cilantro, etc) from the topping bar. We sampled the lamb and the shredded BBQ beef. The beef was my favorite, since the flavor was richer and it was easier to eat. The lamb was a bit fattier and more chunky, but still very good. I was hungry but not overly so, and two tacos with a beer back at home were quite filling enough for me. I could see myself eating three after a long run or a hard workout.

You pay in store (cash, credit/debit) and hand the numbered slip to the cook outside. You can choose among different types of meat. I personally like the chicken and beef.  The cook is honestly so nice and very friendly, though he doesn't speak/understand fluent English. If you ever want to practice your conversational Spanish, check this place out!  The food is so authentic and addictive. If it weren't far from home, I'd come every day.  I love how you can put in the veggies, quac, salsas yourself.  My only complaint is I'd wish they had labels for the different food items because some of the salsas are actually very very spicy. So be careful of what you get. Not everything is as it appears!",

Drool in anticipation of the deliciousness headed your way.  Step 4: Take your already-overstuffed tacos over to the toppings bar and proceed to stuff even further with your choice of toppings (salsas, pico, onions, guac, cilantro, lime, etc.). Top until your heart's content, little taco-maker.  Step 5: Eat your creation standing up on the sidewalk, blissfully unaware of the juices running down your chin and the pico falling from your taco to the ground.  Step 6: Burn your eyebrows off due to dousing your tacos with salsa without realizing how intensely spicy their salsas are. Proceed not to care, because eyebrows grow back...and the tacos are freaking delicious.  Step 7: Repeat frequently upon realizing that this is one of the cheapest and tastiness meal options around!",

The tacos seem pretty authentic because they make them in a little cart outside of the convenience store and the workers are much more comfortable speaking in Spanish than English! That being said, it's really easy to communicate with them as they are extremely friendly and helpful.   If it's your first time going to Las Palmas, make sure you go into the convenience store, go straight to the cashier, and tell them how many tacos you want. They'll make you pay there and write on a small piece of paper the quantity of tacos that you've ordered. Then, you bring that out to the small cart where they'll make the fresh tacos for you. There's another cart on the side outside where you can add toppings such as pico de gallo, guacamole, cilantro, various salsas, etc. Just a heads up - a lot of the salsas are pretty freaking spicy!   Delicious double-wrapped corn tacos with good large variety of proteins. Would recommend!",

It's serviceable when you're sober and it'll do the trick when you're tipsy. Downsides: The meat is cooked and stored in metal containers beside the grill and is cooked again to order. The tortillas for the tacos are store-bought corn ones and the quesadillas come in store-bought flour ones. There is no al pastor. Also I'm 85% sure that it only seems this good because central Pittsburgh has almost no traditional Mexican food and I've been here so long that I forgot how good Mexican food can be.",

There's no menu or label of the meats so you'll just have to wait for the guy to tell you. The problem is that they don't know english that well so I know some customers didn't know \"lengua\" is beef tongue and \"bisteca\" is beef but that probably makes people try stuff they normally wouldn't get. We got 7 tacos for about $17.50. I'd recommend 3 tacos for a hungry person, that 4th taco was a little painful.  In terms of flavor, all the meats were good and tasted authentic. The carnita and beef (tongue and steak with onions) were all savory and slightly salty like they should be. The texture could be a little better but part of the problem is that the guy makes them in batches and they sit out in catering pans for who knows how long, so they dry out a little and aren't warm when they're served to you. The salsa bar to the left of the stand has great variety and some of them pack good heat. The green salsa was a little bland the day I went but the avocado and hot red sauce were good at adding moisture and heat.  Overall I like Las Palmas, it's cheap and tasty but definitely on the shady end of the spectrum.",

Smell the aroma of delicious tacos as you walk down the street-- I mean walk inside to the register and tell them how many tacos you would like (2 is a good number for me).  They take credit, debit, and cash.  Note: They do not do cash back here.  The cashier will give you a receipt that has the number of tacos you paid for. edit: I forgot to say that the tacos are $2.50 each! 2.  Go outside, give the man your little sheet of paper or he will ask how many tacos. 3.  Decide on what meat you would like, if you're unsure what they have, just ask what they have that day because sometimes they'll run out. The standard meats you can get are: chicken, steak, carnitas, barbecue, and chorizo.  He'll give you a generous amount on those 2 nice and crispy corn tortillas.. 4.  Walk on over to their toppings bar to the left and customize your taco to your heart's content.  There is guac, cilantro, onions, tomatoes, and various salsas.  Beware! There are some super spicy ones that'll send you packing to the nearest water fountain. Also notice that there are sauce cups and utensils up top. 5.  Walk around in anticipation to good dining spot to enjoy your delicious tacos. 6.  Repeat!  For my tacos, I like to get the steak and onion and ribeye.  I top it with the green sauce and tons of veggies like the cilantro and jalapeno, tomato, and onion salsa.  I would also get a spoon, because a lot of your toppings tend to fall out while I'm eating.  Do your tastebuds a favor and try Las Palmas' tacos.  I want tacos now...",

Yesterday they had chorizo, carne asada (beef), and lomo (tenderloin).  On Mondays and Thursdays they have beef tongue as well.  The toppings bar is totally what makes it--pico de gallo, salsa verde, a variety of hot salsas, guacamole sauce, and basically ever other topping you can imagine (except cotija--didn't see any cheeses but that was fine by me!).  The corn tacos themselves are great but the hefty portion of meat is a lot for them to hold--my second one tore after the chorizo juice soaked through.  Just be sure to bring a fork and grab some napkins!  There's not a designated sitting area but there's usually a crowd around there.  We took ours to go and then ate over by the Porch.  The cooks were very friendly and will put up with you trying to practice your Spanish if you're so inclined.  Voy a volver!",

I liked the beef one, very flavorful.  Although I did get some gristle in it.  The chicken one was just meh.  I would not order that one again.  These tacos are more authentic that what you think of from most of the Tex-mex joints around here.  Served with 2 tortillas and a large portion of meat.  There is no cheese in traditional tacos so you won't find any shredded jack cheese here.  The things you can add are mainly just chunky salsas and sauces that you can cram your taco full.  This is a 'hunch' kind of meal.  No seats since its street food.  Just gotta find a spot to hunch over your food and try not to let the mess from your overly filled taco hit your shirt.  I will re-review again later and only get the beef next time.  I must have just had an unlucky taco since none of my co-workers seemed to get gristle in theirs.  I'll give it another go.",

The food in the grocery store is so cheap and the produce is really fresh and about a quarter of the price of Giant Eagle.  There is no reason not to eat at this place or shop there all the time.  I probably go about 4 times a week just for tacos (granted its only a 10 minute drive).   Tacos are 2 dollars each toppings are free (4-5 salsas, 3-4 hot sauces, guac, pickled radish, other stuff).  They are usually open from 1-9 daily from what I have seen.",

    "text": "The BEST authentic Mexican food that I have found so far in Pittsburgh. They bumped the price of the tacos up from $2 to $2.50,  but it's well worth the extra .50. The staff has never been anything but friendly both inside and outside the store and they are willing to help with any questions you might have. For $5 you can get two filling tacos with a variety of meat choices including steak, shredded pork, chorizo, chicken, and ground beef. Be sure to ask for the freshly grilled corn tortillas to avoid any of the older tougher ones (which has only happened to me once). There is a toppings bar off to the side where you can pick from several standard toppings, which include: 3 types of salsa (I advise avoiding the deep red unless you chew on habanero peppers on a daily basis), guacamole, tomatoes, cilantro, lime, etc. There can be a short wait which can be avoided by not going between 12-2PM on the weekdays. Inside they sell great Mexican sodas and snacks. I would recommend eating the tacos immediately so that the yummy sauces don't make the tortilla soggy, but if you can't I've had them put the meat on the side of the tortillas so that I can eat it when I get home without worrying. No matter what time I go it's always worth the wait!",

I got 2 chicken and 1 carnitas, and all 3 tacos were awesome. I am someone who doesn't eat meat very often and is a little bit picky when it comes to meat, but the meat here is well-cooked and perfectly seasoned. I especially liked the chicken tacos.   The ordering process is a little bit unique, but it's pretty easy if you know what you're doing. You just have to go inside first and let them know how many tacos you want at the register, and then head outside and pick your meats. There is a topping bar right outside so you can add your own guac, salsa, etc.   The salsas were super spicy, but the flavors were delicious and the spice did not take away from the flavor at all. You get 2 tortillas per taco, and the corn tortillas are warm and flavorful.   Would definitely recommend this place!",

    "text": "The Best Authentic Taco in Pittsburgh.  So I used to live in Southern California for a couple of years, and I've always been craving the \"california\" tacos you can get in the dark streets of LA and/or at a taco truck. Las Palmas has the best authentic tacos you can get in Pittsburgh. In my opinion, there's a lot of taco spots in Pittsburgh that tries to do too much with their tacos, by putting way too much as toppings and extras.  Sometimes, SIMPLICITY IS BEST.  They're super cheap and close to the price of tacos you can get in California ($2.50). It's a crime to pay over $4 per taco. A lot of people look at the store from the outside and think it looks dirty and disorganized, but to be honest, these kind of spots are always the best. Looks can be deceiving.",

    "text": "** Cheap and solid taco place with a topping bar to customize your tacos! Crispy but soft taco shells add a nice flare.  Las Palmas is definitely a solid taco spot that tastes pretty authentic and is only $2.50 a taco, so its a solid choice for students. Its a bit further from the bus stop on Fifth, but on warmer days its worth the trip. In order to get tacos, you need to go into the grocery store and let the cashier know how many tacos you want, and after paying you will get a receipt that you take to the stand outside. The person at the stand will then take your receipt, and then you tell him what toppings you want.   I really like how they put the soft taco shells on the pan for a bit to give it a nice crispy texture to it. My favorite protein hands down is the ground beef, which is on the saltier side but I think goes very well with the guac, onions, cilantro, and salsa in the topping bar. Drizzle in a hint of lime and your in business ;).   The ribeye is definitely worth trying, but it can get pretty oily, and I have a feeling they don't always want you to get it because it's a more expensive protein that they tuck away and they cook on the spot but its for sure an option to try out.   I also like how they allow you to put as many toppings as you want to cater to your unique tastebuds. That being said... WARNING: Some of the hot salsas are super hot and will burn your butt so be careful!! Of course, the pico de gallo that just looks like straight tomato, the onions, and the guac are all safe which is what I usually go with. For the other salsas, I'd strongly advise you put them into the containers above the toppings so that you can test them first before dumping them all over your tacos. I've friends who've eaten the hottest salsa for losing a bet and they've told me you feel the burn twice - once down ur mouth and another when you use the restroom...   The main downsides are that 1) this place has closed down a few times due to health concerns (maybe twice) so eat at your own risk, however I've eaten here several times and have been fine and 2) the tacos definitely do get soggy over time so eat them while they're fresh! Sometimes I do have to say the tacos and/or protein can become pretty oily so sometimes its a bit hit or miss, but overall its solid enough to keep me coming back.",

One of my friends loved it so much that he took 8 tacos from Las Palmas back to his family - in Virginia! I heard this place got closed down a couple times due to health concerns...so maybe eat at your own risk?  Las Palmas is, and continues to be, one of my staples for good Mexican food. As a taco fanatic, I'm blessed to have discovered this place. I love it so much that I've walked here from CMU campus in the freezing 20 degree weather just to get my tacos.  After you buy your tacos from the cashier inside the grocery store, you go outside and show your receipt to the cook. He then heats up the double-layered corn tortilla right in front of you along with your chosen meats, and the aroma is delicious. Although the meat may not look like that much, it's definitely enough to fill you up. The best meat, in my humble opinion, is steak. However, chicken is also good - chorizo is kind of a hit or miss. I usually get 2 tacos every time I eat here, and load them up with toppings at the toppings \"bar\" right next to the taco stand. The toppings include a runny guac, pico de gallo, tomatoes, and a variety of sauces. One of them is extremely spicy, so be careful and ask the cook if you're not great with spice. Trust me - I got it once on accident, and even my spice-loving self had to chug water for a good bit to avoid an untimely death.   Anyway, I love this place. I'd do (almost) anything to get my biweekly fix of Las Palmas steak tacos!",

    "text": "After passing by this place all of the freaking time and seeing so many delicious photos on Yelp, I finally decided to stop by and try this place. Honestly it's not the nicest or cleanest looking, but looks can be deceiving!! I got three tacos: steak, chicken, and chorizo. For only $2.50 a taco (pay inside the store), I had to get more than one and the amount of meat that they give you is huge and is served on two warmed up corn tortillas! The steak meat was waaaaaay too salty and I did not like it at all. The chicken was not dry and was well cooked and tasted fine. The chorizo was SO DELICIOUS (I would definitely recommend the chorizo).  There's a fixings bar to the left of the grill station with tons of sauces and some of them are kinda spicy so just don't put too much on if you aren't certain. And they even have little plastic tins if you want your sauce on the side. I got the veggie salsa (kinda spicy) and the thin guacamole (delicious - not spicy).  All in all, I would definitely love to come here again to try the other meats. The food was done super fast and the cashier and the guy grilling were really nice and courteous. I would definitely recommend this place.",

These are my favorite authentic tacos in Pittsburgh. $2.5 per HUGE taco. Two are plenty, but I get three when I am really hungry. Cash or credit.   This Mexican market makes fresh tacos right outside the store. You can take them to go, or eat standing up outside the market. I prefer to eat them right away because the tortillas can get soggy if left in the to-go box. You could also walk a short distance to Schenley Plaza.   There are rotating choices of meats so ask for their selection when you go. It often includes steak, chicken, chorizo, ground beef, and al pastor and/or carnitas. There is a phenomenal salsa bar to the left so that you can dress your tacos in salsa, onions and cilantro. They also have pickled onions and peppers. The avocado salsa (a thin guacamole) is to die for.   I will keep coming back here for as long as I remain in Pittsburgh!",

The tacos taste pretty authentic based on what I have eaten before and even though the chicken and other meats are very simply cooked - it somehow holds so much flavor. My theory is that the chicken tastes so flavorful because it's cooked on the same surface as the beef and other meats so it essentially gets infused with the flavors of the onions, beef, pork etc as well.   Maybe my attachment to it has to do with eating it so often in college (once a week at least) but I think objectively, it's really flavorful too! It's also pretty cheap - $2.50 a taco and two comfortably fills me up and people significantly bigger than me usually buy 3-4 max so it's a pretty affordable lunch/dinner.",

But it is just a cart on the street in front of a Mexican mini market so I can't complain.  The workers don't always speak much English but you can just point to what meat you want and all the meats are so delicious.  They have varieties of ground beef, ribeye, two kinds of pork, and chicken, and a fajita mix.  One of the best features is their salsa bar which has many delicious salsas and fresh lime and cilantro that you can try all of if you would like.  It's extremely cheap but I think it is cash only.  Definitely a great deal.  I haven't seen any veggie or fish options, so this seems to be a place for meat lovers, and the meat portions are generous.",

One of the salsa's had pomplano and was very tasty. If in Oakland on weekends, do yourself a favor and hit this stand.  Only open on weekends. FYI- They don't have any seating. Most of the clientele are locals like me who walk home to eat. But there are always a few apartments on Atwood for rent with steps out front that you can sit real quick and eat on the steps. No one bothers you. It's a laid- back, college vibe in this area. Cash only. Prices: $2.50/ taco but when you see the size of them you will understand.  Parking tip: if Atwood has no parking, try one street over (Meyran) or York St.",

This is as authentic as you'll find in Pittsburgh, along with Renya's in the Strip. The tacos are absolutely delicious. chorizo, lengua, chicken, ground beef, steak, and a new fajita mix are all offered, and the topping bar is fantastic. Be warned that there is no cheese or sour cream on the topping bar, but with the guacamole, salsa, and cilantro it isnt needed. Lines can be a little long during lunchtime, of course, but it's well worth it.",

    "text": "Fucking authentic to the 9's.  After being dragged to a variety of \"Mexican\" food places by various people here and being horrified by the so called \"Mexican Food\" and the disgustingly low quality salsa--I came across this place and now I can say that I. AM.  HAPPY.    I remember a few weeks I went into Mad Mex and asked for their spiciest salsa.  On a scale of 1 to 10, it was a 3.  :(  Yinzers aren't much into spicy food.  Everything here is either bland or toned down to meet the boring tastes of the locals.    But Las Palmas--they are authentic.  You can tell by the Mexican music and the real Mexican people that work there.  Not a single gringo working there.  I got a drink and paid for a couple of tacos inside before walking back out to get my street food.    2.50 per taco, unlimited toppings at the salsa bar.    I asked the guy what the spiciest salsas were and he pointed me towards the orange (haberno) and red(some kind of hot pepper).  I slathered my tacos in the salsas, liberally applied pico, grabbed a few limes and a grilled pepper.  Then I walked down the road to enjoy my lunch.  What happened next was mouth blowing.   I placed the taco in my mouth and took a bite.  Sheer pleasure.  After all the crappy Mexican food I've had here, this was a revelation.  The zing of the onions, the softness of the corn tortillas, the kick of the salsas.  I took another bite.  I was in heaven for a few seconds.   Until my mouth exploded in FIRE and went to straight to hell.  Holy Jesus!  If Satan made a salsa, the habenero would be it.  It was so sinful.  My face started to burn up and snot began to drip uncontrollably out my nostrils.  I must have looked like a disaster.  I polished off my first taco but had to pick at my second because I was hyperventilating like no ones business.  I downed my Jumex juice in a matter of seconds and then sprinted to the nearest store to buy a much needed bottle of water.  OMG OMG OMG.  So much pain and pleasure at the same time.    On a scale of 1 to 10, habenero salsa here is a 9.3.  Hopefully I do not diarreah later tonight.",

    "text": "Look, I don't care what people say: this place is awesome. Am I biased for being Latino? Definitely. But this is good cheap food. Comparing this place to Qdoba, Chipotle, etc. is not fair. Because comparing the street food from any country versus an Americanized joint is unfair because it is not the same -nor it tries to be-. Not saying the competition is not good, just saying the style is different. The food is cheap (about two dollars per taco) made in front of you in the street. No sitting, just street food -may be that is why it is so cheap?-  My favorites are tongue and rajas (potatoes, cream, and chiles which is a vegetarian option).   They also make tamales, which are not necessarily the best tamales in the world but they are the standard tamales you find in any Latino grocery store.  The meat section at the back certainly caters the Latino community -or those interested- as the cuts you find are the ones we constantly use, especially in Mexican cuisine.  Other than that it is a small grocery store that has products from Latin america.   COMMENT: they have fresh baked goods (pan dulce).",

    "text": "I was really excited to try the tacos here because of all the great reviews. At the same time, I was worried I'd set my expectations too high and would be disappointed. I am happy to say that I suffered no disappointment.  I paid my $2.50 for a taco inside the grocery store, then returned outside. I did not experience any language barriers. After I chose my meat, the man placed a tortilla in the box and added a generous amount of carnitas. (Other choices included chorizo and chicken.) I saw him warming tortillas as I entered the store; the meat was already cooked. I then took my taco to the condiment station and added tomatoes, pico de gallo, cilantro, and guacamole. My spice tolerance is really low so I didn't try any of the salsas. I then walked for about five minutes before I ate, so the food wasn't hot.  The tortilla alone is just a little crispy, thick, and delicious. The meat was tender, moist, and flavorful. There was a lot, especially considering the price. Usually, that wouldn't be a pro for me, but at the condiments bar, I was able to add a lot of vegetables, which really helped balance out the meatiness. Everything was fresh, and the guacamole was good as well. The pico de gallo was a little spicy (just bearable for me if I ate it along with everything else), and I actually enjoyed the kick it lent the taco (I usually avoid spice). Next time, I'll probably try some of the salsas. I also want to try the taco as soon as I add the toppings, when it's really warm. The tacos are a pretty great deal--I'd say two or three would do for a meal.   I also took a quick look around the grocery store. It's small and really cramped. They have a lot of pantry items, some produce, and some bread.",

This place has it all! By far one of my favorite places to eat...ever. The chicken tacos and the BBQ beef are my go-tos along with their salsa, pico de gallo, and endless lemons! I can't say enough good things about this place. You just need to experience it to truly believe it!  Just as a sidenote, the salsa at the toppings bar aren't labeled...do yourself a favor (if you're not into spicy salsas) and avoid the deep red salsa. Unless you're SUPER into spicy (trust me, I'm a lover of spice, but I couldn't handle this salsa!), I would steer clear. I tried it once and it literally made my mouth hurt. Other than that, everything is solid and delicious!   I'm constantly craving them. It's gotten so bad that I think of the amount of money I have in terms of how many tacos I can purchase at Las Palmas. So give it a go! You won't be sorry.",

It's a shame that Las Palmas doesn't have a couple lawn chair sitting around or a bench in front of the store but the toppings bar takes up so much room that I don't think it would fit.

Only down-side, having to eat on someone else's front porch was less than ideal. It was cool finally finding the other latinos in the city, since 50% of the customers were clearly immigrant laborers having their weekend lunch out. I hadn't been able to use my Spanish since moving to Pittsburgh - problem solved! Don't worry, though, the two guys out front definitely speak English, too, it was just more fun for Carla and I to finally be able to speak Spanish somewhere.   My only complaint - no fish tacos? I guess I'll have to go to Reyna's for that. But it's good to know I can grab a real (good) taco this close to work.",

A few noteworthy things:  - their green mangos (don't be put off by the color - they are delicious) - the slices flan and tres leches cake sitting in the fridge - the ROASTED coconut juice (it's that much better than regular coconut juice, which I hate) - they sell plantains!

Now, I've never been to Mexico, so I can't comment on the authenticity. But in terms of spicy and flavorful? Not to me. In terms of flavor other than spicy heat, the whole business tasted pretty bland, from the shredded beef to the salsa to the thin and runny avocado paste. The corn tortillas were presumably relatively freshly made, but had the texture and flavor of stale cornbread crossed with dry cardboard. The only flavor that really reached my taste buds was a mild sweetness, and that's not my cup of tea. One point off.  Also, I've got to mention this simply because so many people hyped up this place's red hot habanero sauce to me before I went, including a lot of reviews here. I've never, ever thought of myself as having a high tolerance for spiciness (I usually eat pretty bland, IMO!), but I slathered over a full ladle on each taco. I could taste the heat, sure. But it was pretty mild - I didn't even feel like I needed to drink water. Now, I will say that the people I went with thought I had an insane poker face. They put half as much on theirs and ended up sweaty, red-faced, and teary-eyed, so maybe I'm the weird one. Still, if a place is known primarily for spiciness, I'm going to expect that I'll personally be blowing smoke out my nose and ears. One point off.  Atmosphere: It's a dinky little stand outside, the only one of its kind on the block. If half the block were stands, that wouldn't be a problem, but it's not like that, so it feels a little strange. Trash cans were piled high, and maybe it's because it's Oakland and college students are inane, but trash was piled high on the sidewalk near it, too! Gross. Also, there's no such thing as seating, so people were just standing around with their food, trying not to make eye contact. Not the most fun way to spend a lunch. Given that it's a street stand, any single thing could've been excused. However, all of them combined = point off.  Service: It's self-service. No complaints.  Price: It's really cheap, to the point where even though the food is mediocre, it was worth the price. I mean, it'd probably cost more to cook it from scratch, even if you did own all the spices and bought in bulk prices. So that's unusual.  Overall, the price is great but the food is low on flavor, regardless of authenticity.",

    "text": "After eating here I felt like I had hit the jackpot.  I had wanted so badly to try Las Palmas tacos but with the public bus service being what it is today Las Palmas in Brookline was out of my reach. The hour bus ride there and back I could not commit to. Then I found out there is  a location in Oakland and after class today I walked from Fifth Ave to Atwood to finally have my tacos!!!   Las Palmas tacos are filled with 3 times as much meat then what I've been served at Taco Bell, Qdobe and Chipotle.  I am sending a warning to those cooperate chains you've got some competition in Las Palmas. I knew going into this the tacos would be big so I played it safe and got two. One chorizo and one steak and onions. The Chorizo may have been a tad dry but all is forgiven for the price of $2.00 dollars.",

Considering how small the space is, they sure did pack in a lot of inventory!!  They take credit card, there's a reasonable amount of street parking, they carry all the standard supplies, the prices are reasonable, and did I mention the STREET TACOS :D!  Seriously, the street tacos are yummmmy!!  They're definitely bigger portions than the typical street tacos, but I' won't complain :)  They didn't have my go-to Al Pastor meat, but their carnitas were really good!  Definitely going to be making more trips to Las Palmas!",

Everyone is on point with their reviews of Las Palmas as offering cheap (2.50), authentic, Mexican tacos (gringo-style lovers beware). Three of these bad boys makes for a large meal for one person.   Pay inside the store and they will give you a receipt to hand to the people operating the taco stand outside. Pick your meat, which will then be placed on an incredibly fresh corn tortilla, load up your tacos with some condiments and salsa, and enjoy.  When you finish stuffing that last meat filled corn tortilla into your face, you'll realize that you will be back again and again to repeat your newfound feeding ritual.  Grab a Mexican soda from the fridge inside to wash down the meaty goodness.",

He heats up the tortillas, tops them with protein, and leaves you to add whatever else you want on em. Definitely give this place a try. It's down and dirty, but then again so is everything in So.

The corn tortillas were a bit dry (I may have gotten some old ones), and there were two per taco (which I think is excessive). As for the meats, the steak could be more rare (mine were well done), but was seasoned nicely. The chicken was tender, but could use a little more salt. The chorizo was quite spicy and overpowers all the other meats. I would recommend eating it last to fully taste the quality of the other tacos.  There is a nice large bar to the side, but unfortunately didn't have guacomole. For $2.50 per taco, I would say they are a bit pricy. Best Mexican food I have had in Pittsburgh so far.",
