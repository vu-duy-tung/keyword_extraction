    "text": "Bado's easily ranks in my top 5 favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh. Their pizza sauce carries a subtle sweetness that makes it unique to most other places in town, and their non-pizza cuisine is decent as well.   The atmosphere is nice. The service is friendly and almost always good. The restaurant does fill up quickly on most nights making it difficult to get in and get out. They have a great beer selection, though the bar area is small and easily overcrowds.  The only major negative is that when you order the potato skins, they hide the sour cream underneath the cheese so it can't be seen until it's too late. This can be quite a shock for those who prefer their skins condimentless.",

I've had everything here; brunch (eggs can be greasy but everything else is good), lunch, dinner, PIZZA, even just for drinks, I've had it all here. Bado's pizza is one of the best pizzas I've ever had!  It can be a little pricey with toppings, but it's worth it.  I love their rotating beer menu as there's usually something to keep me happy. The service is always good as well. We usually sit at the bar so the bartenders know us well.  Bado's gets two thumbs up from this girl!",

The chicken salad, the lettuce was wilted, although the chicken strips were the best thing in the whole order. The turkey grilled sandwich also had no lettuce or tomato and was greasy and soggy and did not come with the chips and pickles as listed on the menu. For what they charged for this. It was a disgrace . We will not order again and will pass the word around. There are too many other  decent and less expensive delivery restaurants to ever order from there again. Disappointed.",

I just feel like I've had much better pizza elsewhere around town. And for sure a better margherita. Theirs fell into the category that I find most end up in: a regular cheese pizza. Quite a few places seem to not understand the differences between the two, and this place was no different.  Now, the cheese/margherita pizza they served me was pretty good, but it didn't stand out for me. The other two ordered sandwiches of some sort that they both really seemed to like. The beer selection was also a bit lacking for my taste, but that may just be because they didn't have anything I liked so I stuck with water (that's me when I go out to eat: alcohol or water ;).",

The topping itself was also a bit meh - I usually order this for how refreshing it tastes but this dish felt rather heavy.  The wedding soup was pretty good - fit my need for some comforting soup.  I realize I didn't have pizza here, but based on this I'd be reluctant to come back and try their food again.

    "text": "I am not being hyperbolic when I say that my last experience here was the worst food experience I have ever had.   I have eaten at Bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. So when my roomate wanted to go there, I was pretty excited. There were 4 of us. Two of us had burgers while the other two ordered wedding soup and shared potato skins. My burger was delicious. It was juicy and smothered in bleu cheese.   While my food was really good, there were some issues with the other items ordered. Two of my guests cited that the wedding soup had a metalic taste to it while my other friend with the burger found a hair. Being a hairdresser and understanding that it does happen sometimes, she disregarded it and continued to eat her burger. Unfortunately, the hair did not stop there. Another guest found several hairs in their meal as well. We decided that we should let our waitress know. I stopped the waitress and explained how there was hair in two people's food. The waitress got upset and was very rude (it's not like we accused her of planting the hair herself). On top of this, she mistakenly took my burger and walked away with it, leaving the sullied food on the table. When she came back I told her that my burger was not one of the items with food on it and she instantly became defensive. At this point we asked for a manager (who never came) and insisted our meal get comped. Considering she threw out the only good food that we ordered, we didn't feel like that was asking too much. Luckily the waitress did not put up too much of a fight.   I will never eat at Bado's again. A good cheese burger and a decent pie isn't enough when the staff can't even accept their own (human) mistakes. I have been places where there have been food issues before and I have also worked in a restaurant. I completely understand that mistakes happen. However, the reaction that we received was unacceptable.",

Please check out a full review of the wings on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fchickenwinglovers&s=a9c92ed40221d4212343e4ce1899edd500e4706475e85e24ab4c8695bf65837a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/chickenwing...</a> .",

The sauce wasn't sour, and the toppings were fresh and tasty.   Now...as for the service...the waiter was grumpy. He did what we asked him to, but acted unpleased about it.   As for the integrity of the place...they have a permanent sign saying Monday special -  \"$1 off draft beer (some restrictions apply).\" We ordered 8 draft beers...4 different types. When the bill came, I asked the waiter about the Monday drink special. He had to go ask the manager, but explained to us it was only one 1 beer.  Try had dozens of draft beer, and how they make the mental leap of \"some rstrictions\" to damned near all restrictions show a complete lack of integrity.   The pizza was good...but the whole integrity issue raised the question of what else are they doing behind the curtain that may not be in the up and up.  Its good I live out of town, because I won't be back. No pizza is worth the experience we had here.",

I've been here more than a handful of times, and have never been disappointed.  They always have a healthy selection of craft beers.  My favorite item from the menu is their pizza.  Some of my favorites are the Gourmet Bianco (white pizza with feta cheese and artichoke hearts) or the Ferrari (eggplant, roasted red peppers, Sicilian olives, cheese).  Appetizers are usually good too, but I'd skip the calamari.    The restaurant also has TVs - depending where you are seated, it can be an excellent place to enjoy beer & good food.  Also great for brunch!  Definitely worth checking out!",

There was a small bar with 3 draft beers to choose from, tables set up for food and tables to sit at.  We were served their huge pepperoni pizza which was very tasty!

Young male server( I think his name was \"Sorry\" because he said it so many times) was clueless. My son and I ordered pizza and it was fine( although not as good as before) and my wife ordered a corned beef sandwich. The sandwich was dry and the fries bordering on cold( the few of them that were on the plate at least. Very small amount). When my wife mentioned it to Sorry, he said it was done before the pizza and sat there. That was that...no mention of getting new fries, new sandwich, free drink. Nothing!!  Upon telling Sorry that I wanted to see the manager, he was a big help also. Said he would let the owners know. I'm so thankful for that. Also, went to the rest room. Toilet paper laying in the floor, dirty, dirty, dirty. Also, the hostess standing at the podium playing with her cell phone was a nice added touch also. Bye, bye Bados !!!!!!!",

The food is average at best (Same pizza as Cici's pizza as far as taste) We payed a little shy of 1000.00$ for two and a half large pizzas, a small pan of overcooked wings,  Two loaves of bread with some balogna and ham they called a hoagie, and a small salad. Thank goodness they had beer and wine(at an extra cost) for us to drink and two televisions to watch the football game on(But wouldnt turn any sound on)  . They told us it was an all you can eat buffet for our guest (most were over 60) but when the wings and salad were gone they would replinish it only for \"An extra phenominal fee\" . The people who wanted to enjoy a cup of coffee were also told so sorry,, That will also be an \"Additional Cost\"!! The money isnt an issue if they would have been up front and honest with us.  We all had a TERRIBLE experience here and unfortunately will NEVER step foot in this place again. And to top things off,,  The pizza and two so called hoagies that were left over(because they were all bread) and we payed for, We were told we could not take home because someone might get sick.   Im sorry, But I didnt pay to feed your staff dinner !!!!!   On a good note, The bartender was a great guy and very good at his job.",

Best to stick with the pizza, which is pretty good, and the soup and salads, which are quite good.  Place also has a solid beer selection, which is reasonably priced.  That said, we've found that it's a total mistake to order anything else off the menu -- except at breakfast, which again is pretty good.  (Their omlets are huge!)  For example, we once ordered a spinach-artichoke app.  Sounded delicious.  Um... it was creamed spinach (probably of frozen origin) with some canned artichokes in it.  Disappointing to say the least.  Also be aware that they close the kitchen ... when they feel like it.  I didn't know that until we were drinking a few beers there a while back and they made a kitchen last call.  My sister asked the bartender when the kitchen closes -- he said, when we feel like it.  One thing is for sure, though, if you go with what they do best (Pizza and beer), you won't be disapointed.  Plus, the servers are True Pittsburgh and generally very sweet.",

My first expierence with this place was two years ago, I had spent the entire day in the waiting room of St. Clair Hospital with my mother who was admitted finally at 8pm, she was fine and released a few days later. But at 8pm I was ready to eat anything and Bado's was on the way home. So I parked and walked I'm and the place was packed. Good sign. So a seat at the bar opened and the Pens were playing. So I ordered a bottled IPA and read over the menu. I needed to power carb after a long day of sitting in a hospital waiting room. The bartender who doubled as a pizza chef told me the white pizza was exceptional, so I took his advice and ordered a medium, figuring I could have it for lunch the next day. What arrived was this wonderfully thick, cheesy, reeking of garlic in a good way, just what I needed, comfort food that instantly made the days worries seem distant. The first bite was heaven, chewy center, crisp bottom, olive oil coating my mouth, ooey, gooey italian cheeses, saltiness from the black olives I ordered as a topping. This was pizza! Two slices and I was full, I drank my beer and paid the bill, and walked out with lunch and dinner for the next day. I must return here someday and have the same pie.",

Showed up as a party of two and was asked if we could be seated upstairs, plenty of room downstairs so not sure what that was all about. But there is a huge decor difference between the two levels, downstairs is decent bar atmosphere while upstairs is very undesirable and outdated to say the least.  Nice beer selection so I was happy to try something new with dinner and was very pleased. We got the breadstick and meatball appetizer, I was very happy with the choice and I must say at first I was nervous. Only because the bottom of the breadsticks were burnt but they tasted fine. Meatballs tasted homemade, were very soft, and the sauce complimented the dish very well. Bado's sauce is very good, not sweet or bitter, not overly seasoned with spices, perfectly balanced which is hard to find. I was impressed! Now onto our dinner choices, my wife got a small pepperoni calzone which for her was her go to choice no matter where we go. She was happy with the calzone and even made the comment that she wished she would have gotten the large. I chose the large Buffalo chicken calzone and ended up taking half of it home which I intended to do. So here is where I get picky, while I loved the taste and texture of Baldo's dough the middle of the calzone was extra thick with dough. Making it chewy, the cheese wasn't melted but the calzone clearly looked cooked on the outside with two dark spots (which I love). Overall flavor was good, the chicken and buffalo sauce worked well together. So I have given 3 stars considering the total experience and my wife and I both agreed to come back and try the pizza.",

My plate came with all items on it a different color....  The fries were a darkened shade of brown.. The bread was toasted hard and brown.. When I touched the sandwich it was very hard -not warm-brown with burnt dark black rim. The meat sticking out the sides of the sandwich were a very dark burgundy black and they crunched like a burnt piece of bacon.  Kelsey gladly replaced the plate but when she brought something somewhat similar with lighter toast, the same burnt bacon on the inside.  This was a very unpleasant lunch experience.  I feel generous giving Bado's 2stars and they were given because of the first time we went weeks ago.  Don't know if and when I'll ever try it again. The experience left me with a really bad taste!!!",

    "text": "How have I not written a review for this place yet? I LOVE Bado's. It's right down the street from one of my old schools, so I have a lot of fond memories of eating here once a week or so with my mom during the school's lunch break.   With that in mind, because I often come here craving pizza and I was a child patron, I tend to just forget that, oh yeah: they have a full menu, and they serve alcohol as well. Not only do they serve alcohol, but my family has actually purchased six-packs from the bar since Bado's is easier to get to than a beer distributor. I think they have a decent but obviously not expansive beer selection if we're taking the time to buy and carry a six pack home.  As for the food? No complaints. The pizza is delicious, and Bado's also has a bunch of other meal options like sandwiches, soups and salads, so you're sure to find something here. All of my personal favorite dishes here are cheesy and come with standard but still tasty sauces that just complete the meal. One of my favorite things from Bado's is actually their calzones, which are enormous and yet, oddly enough, \"light.\" Not light in calories, but light in the amount of grease and oils in the meal. This, of course, is compared to take-out chains, so I'm sure it's still way too much and not that good for you. But still, I've always felt that their calzones have the perfect blend of toppings, sauces, and so forth, and they're borderline divine - the perfect local splurge.  Just keep in mind, Bado's is popular and it gets crowded. Fast. Be prepared for a wait or try to show up during slow hours, i.e. not right after work - especially on a Friday. But really, other than that, I can't complain about this place. In fact, just talking about it makes me crave pizza...mmmmmm.",

    "text": "So I had a gift certificate from a local radio station to Bado's, so I checked it out. I want around seven on a Monday night, also Columbus Day if that has any impact, and there was really no crowd.  My server, Barry, was very nice and was very good.  Right off the bat, I'll explain why am taking two stars away. The service was a little bit too fast for me between my two courses as within maybe three minutes of my salad being taken away my pizza came right out. Normally I'm a fan of fast service but that was a little bit too fast for me. I'm also taking a star off, and whoever reads this review will probably think this is a stupid reason but this review is my opinion, because the salads with the exception of a few or overpriced compared to the other appetizers.  I had the grilled portobello mushroom salad and the 4 cut margherita pizza.   The salad was huge but great, the house Italian dressing complemented the salad really well. The salad was a nice mix of mushroom and greens, though I'd have preferred a bigger helping of greens. Of course you're not going to like this salad if you don't like mushrooms.   The pizza was tasty and pretty well done. Oh my goodness was it tasty. You could really taste the tomatoes and basil playing off each other and neither was overpowered by the cheese. Secondly, the tomatoes tasted fresh, not like the canned, heavily processed kind or tomato paste but like the diced San Marzanno organic tomatoes you can buy at fancier grocery stores. That went a long way for me with the pizza.   The con for the pizza: I have to say it was weird to me that the crust was this weird mix of crispy and kind of hard to cut and then perfectly chewy. The actual bottom of the pizza was crispy, like it should be so the pizza doesn't fall apart, but it was a little too crispy for my tastes as there were a couple points where I had a hard time cutting the pizza into bite-size pieces. I also have to comment that two of my slices, the two that I ended up bringing home because I was stuffed, hadn't been fully cut apart and that was a little annoying. I can overlook it, but it's still something I want to comment on.  This isn't the kind of pizza that you can easily just pick up and eat with your hands because there is so much to it. It's a very dense pizza.   I want to end this review by commenting on the slightly weird pricing for the pizzas. The pizza is priced based off of how many slices the pizza is cut into. And, I feel the pizza was a little bit pricey for the four slice pizza that I got, it was just under $13.   That all said though I had a fun time at Bado's and I'll go back.",

I recall first seeing deep-fried artichoke hearts on one of Bobby Flay's Food Network programs. Somewhat of a state fair treat, I'd never thought that they could be prepared in such a manner.   I've had them at least one other time since, and Bado's were almost as delectable. The ideally fried exterior revealed lush, steamy flesh inside, the horseradish mayonnaise (?) proving to be a cooling, creamy condiment for these morsels that retained their heat a good while after plating, surely burning the tongues of many an impatient guest.   Also thoroughly enjoyed was the Meatball Hoagie, which was generously overstuffed with meteors of succulent ground chuck, provolone, and a marvelously sweet and tangy marinara that smacked of freshly picked tomatoes, grandmothers, and massive pots that simmer for hours on end.   Bado's ain't a Bad place to nosh at, abitanti.",

    "text": "Stopped in and was just going to have a quick shot and a beer. The bartender greeted me in a friendly manner and I asked for a shot of Jameson and an Anderson Valley Spring Horn'in IPA. While reviewing the menu I noticed that on this particular evening the special was cheese lasagna with garlic bread and a salad.  Hummm, for $7.95, how could I resist?  The salad came out quickly with what you would expect on a salad: lettuce, tomato, spinach, cucumber, onion mushrooms and croutons. They also had my favorite dressing, raspberry vinaigrette, which always scores points with me. But what struck me most was the sheer size of the salad. For a side salad this was huge; not a meal in itself but definitely bigger than I've gotten at most places.  It didn't take to long afterwards for the Lasagna to come out. In following suit with the salad, it was a huge slice covered in a tasty, tomatoey, tomato sauce. A slice of garlic bread accompanied it. Like I said, it was a cheese lasagna and there was no shortage of ricotta between pasta layers. A layer of sausage or ground beef would have done wonders for this lasagna but it stood well on its own just fine. I enjoyed half of it (how much carbs does one man need?) and put the rest in a take home container for lunch tomorrow. I think I'll pick up some of those frozen pre-cooked meatballs and add them to it to balance this lasagna out.   I've been to Bado's before and have always experience solid service, relevant craft beers and good food. This evening was no exception.",

The dough has some good flavor, and the bottom has just a little \"snap\" to it.  I have not tried the thin.  The Sicilian is too doughy for me - almost like a double-stack of \"regular.\"  The sauce is proper tomato and is not too sweet.  Cheese is adequate, and toppings are good, and laid on pretty heavily.  I've had the meatball sandwich (very good) and a few salads (fresh and good).  I also like the variety of beers on tap.  This place is bigger inside than it looks outside, and is good for kids/families (they have a kids' menu), as well as for adults on the bar-side.  Lots to like here.",

There is no service for your phone data, but you can use their wifi hidden in their table menu.     We started with provolone sticks. They were served with marinara and horse radish sauce. The horse radish was actually very good with them.      The grilled chicken salad was ordered with balsamic, which I recommend. Served with the ole Pittsburgh fries, as well as onion, tomato, pepper, and mixed greens.     The kids hot dog was a hot dog. For an up charge, you can get the apple sauce instead of fries. My kid inhaled it all.      The pizza was a regular 8 cut with pepperoni and meatball, my sons choice. The dough was soft and fluffy and sweet. The sauce is sweet with a pepper taste, very good. The meat and cheese were cooked well with a consistency of soft cheese and crispy pepperoni and well done meatball. Overall the pizza here is a slam dunk.     The service today was very good. We were attended to quite well. Everything, from putting our order in and getting our food, was done timely. The service, the last few times we've come, has been much better since my first review. We usually come when it is not too busy, around 4:30. I've been here around lunch and they have some lunch specials that I think you can check out on their site.     Overall, it is good here. The prices can be a little steep, but the quality and quantity are adequate.",

My friends got pizza and said it was the best they had had in a long, long time. I really don't think you can go wrong with any of the toppings.  If you've read some of my other reviews, you know I have 14 food allergies. This makes it almost impossible to dine anywhere, but when a restaurant feeds me with ease, I am a happy camper! They accommodated me with no problem and I had a delicious grilled chicken salad! I was very impressed.  My mom was not too keen on her bruschetta wedge salad, mainly because of the dressing (which is homemade, however I do love their homemade greek dressing!).

It's been an hour and a half and i've not mentioned to anyone that I ordered a pizza for pick up. It's cold by the time I shuffle out. I put the thing in my car and head back to the east end. Get home, open the pizza. Luke warm. We both grab a slice. It is AWESOME. Maybe I'm so used to having shitty pizza, but this is definitely the best pizza I've had in Pittsburgh thus far. The cheese and pep were cooked to a golden perfection. The sauce wasn't over powering. The sauce/bread/cheese ratio was exactly what I needed for my hangover stomach.

It wasn't the standard margarita pizza that we have been used to, but it was still good.  The pizza had an extremely liquidy tomato sauce with large chunks of tomatoes. It was topped with a little regular shredded cheese and a couple small pieces of fresh mozzarella. It would have been better if there wasn't so much liquid in the sauce to make it soggy and if there was more fresh mozzarella. I love tomatoes so I enjoyed it. However, my boyfriend doesn't mind them, but doesn't love them so didn't like it. The tomato is definitely the dominant flavor and absolutely the main ingredient in the pizza. The breadsticks were good and weren't greasy (something I hate) and the potato skins had a unique twist with their cheese selection. Service was good too.",

The price, at $6.95, is fair for what you get, but unlike some of my other favorite lunchtime pizza buffets, this one does not include the drink, so that is extra.  It does come with a soup or salad included in the price, and I chose the Wedding Soup, and unfortunately, I was not enamored by the soup at all.  It didn't have much taste, and even after adding salt, pepper, and grated cheese, it still wasn't very flavorful.  As for the pizzas, they had three choices, Pepperoni, Plain, and Supreme.  I thought the pizzas were just O.K.  I am not a big fan of pepperoni, so I personally found the choices a little limited, since two out of three had pepperoni on them.  I did try a slice of each, and they were fine, but the taste to me was just average.  I was hoping that they might bring out a different style of pizza once the first pies cleared off, but they only brought out another pepperoni while I was there.   Overall, it was a decent lunch buffet, but in my opinion, there are better ones in the area.",

They have a great beer selection, and the brunch menu had something for everyone! I got the chicken and waffles, it was huge so I probably should have shared it, but I didn't want to. I was very happy with my choice, and everyone else loved their food too. The lunch and dinner menu definitely has something for everyone too. The atmosphere and service was great - perfect for a chill hang with friends!",

    "text": "We recently hosted an event at Bado's for our family.   I was able to easily speak with the event coordinator and set up the details of our event when I called. I customized the menu a bit due to some food allergies and called in two weeks ahead of time to confirm our count for our \"adult pizza party\" off of the banquet menu.  When we arrived, we were able to set up early and get ready for the event. Everyone was able to fit comfortably in the space and since the private room is upstairs, you also have access to the outdoor deck area. The room was clean and well laid out. There were also 2 TVs, a private bar, and the outdoor deck.  For food we had a mix of veggies and various dips, sandwich ring, and pizza. The pizza was probably the biggest party pizza I'd ever seen and was a big hit with guests. Included in the pizza party per person pricing were also three beers that were on tap.  The one weird thing was that at the end of the party there was some leftover food (i.e. about a quarter of a pizza); so as I was paying the bill I of course asked for it to be boxed up. Before this there was no indication that it was \"catering\" style and that any leftover food was to be left in the restaurant. I was told that the food could not be boxed due to house rules. I didn't understand since I had literally just paid for all of the food, but wasn't able to take it with me. It also wasn't explained well when I asked about it. In general it made me feel like they were being super sticklers and honestly ruined my excitement about telling others about the good parts of our experience.  For what the party was, it was a great room to host an event, but there are definitely some oddities that need worked out.",

Once seated at a table is when the night went south. Our waiter seemed pretty disinterested in being at work as he moaned and groaned during introduction. I ordered the 'Famous' fish sandwich and my wife ordered a Cajun burger. Well the 'Famous' in my food title must stand for famously bad. It was the worst piece of fish I have ever had...it was flat as a pancake...no flaky white fish to be seen.  I'd equate it to eating a sponge full of grease. The only taste out of it was from whatever other food shared the grease bath. Maybe I could have disguised the taste with the condiments I asked for but the disinterested fellow I mentioned before didn't bring them until asked and the sandwich was half done. As for my wife's burger...the taste was good but it was way over cooked since she ordered medium and the burger was well done. I'd return for a drink if ever passing by, but can honestly say I'd never come back for a meal there. Too bad because it's a nice little neighborhood to visit.",

Check their website for daily specials - pizza buffet, all you can eat spaghetti, lasagna night, etc., all at extremely affordable prices!  I visited this establishment on a Tuesday and had the pizza buffet- the buffet has standard pizzas (pepperoni, cheese, supreme, and then a specialty pie, for example a margherita pizza). The buffet was small but had pizza to suit anyone's food personality! It also comes with a small house salad, and their dressings come in large bottles that they leave at the table; I got ranch dressing with my salad (which tasted homemade and delicious) and I was glad that they left the bottle so my boyfriend and I could dip our pizza crusts in a little big of the dressing!   Also, on the buffet night, they had a balloon artist who makes flowers, headbands, or swords for the kids, a really nice touch. The kids at he tables surrounding us were all giggly and happy when the man was delivering their balloon gifts!  Also, it is worth noting that the bar area is separated from the restaurant section almost completely with a wall; so no need to worry that you and your family will not be able to enjoy each other's company or feel uncomfortable with little ones in the bar. Just ask for a booth by the window in the restaurant area and you will be farthest from the bar and you will be able to feel comfortable with your little ones.",

My *only* gripe is that sometimes the cutting of our pizza seems to have been done by someone with a very dull cutting blade, which is a small pain in the butt.   We have had their sandwiches, salads and other items too and they're all good. The pizza is where it's at though.",

They were taking so loudly that two tables near them left after placing their order. The owner asked them to keep it down but they were drunk and clueless. Probably won't return.",

With the pizza ovens firing along with the grill running the smell of pizza and cheese steaks wafted into our complex.  I went out with a couple work buddies and we each had the cheese steak. Have to say the $10 combo meal of the cheese steak, which was loaded with steak, mushrooms, and onions, along with chips and a drink was well worth it and phenomenal tasting.   Everything came out ready in under 5 minutes and was piping hot.   Will recommend this food truck and grille whenever they come around.",

I ordered a Greek wrap, and asked for very light cheese. Instead I got a Greek wrap with TONS of cheese & hardly any vegetables. It was more like a lettuce wrap.   When I asked for more veggies, I was brought a cup of lettuce, tomatoes, and black olives...   Ordered a second glass of wine. When our server brought our a glass that looked like a taste sample I was confused. He told me it was the bottom of the bottle, and they were all out. He then told me that it would be 1/2 price, if you could see the look on my face....  I asked him to bring me another type of wine, and that I shouldn't have to pay for a splash of wine. Of course when the check came it was still listed, and then had to be removed.   This is the busiest restaurant in Beverly Rd Shops and I'm not sure why. Would be open to coming back for a pizza but that's about it.",

Unfortunately, tonight we didn't experience anything close to that. To be fair they were busy. It was a Friday so that was to be expected. Our waitress did say that the kitchen was a little backed up but we were in no rush.  We ordered right away.  We sat, we waited. We kept our 8 year old entertained with games of would you rather and 20 questions. Finally our waitress returned with my entree. Just mine. She said the other food would be out soon. I tried to wait to eat but as my food got cold everyone insisted I eat. So I ate slowly hoping their food would come. It didn't.   I finished and we sat debating if we should just go home and boil some pasta and call it a night. Finally, nearly 90 minutes after ordering our food it arrived...and was subpar. My daughter's meatball was undercooked, the sauce was bland and my husbands hot pastrami sandwich had a nice cold slice of provolone on it. In 90 minutes you would think the cheese would have at least been melted...  I get it, people get busy, things go wrong in the kitchen. But in a case like tonight the restaurant should have at the very least bought us a round of drinks. We will not be back.",

They had 6-7 personal pizza options... when I'm trying a new pizza I like to go with a classic and went with the pepperoni.  The wait was a little longer than I liked, but Grist was packed and I was hungry!   Pizza came out and could easily be shared with 2 people.  It was covered in really tasty thin pepperoni, a healthy amount of cheese and good quality tomato sauce.  The crust is thinner, solid crisp, very good.    4 stars because to me this is not THE BEST pizza in the burgh, but still very good! They could also work on wait times :)",

I came here around noon on the weekend but they were only serving brunch and I was initially disappointed. However, after sharing with the server that we came for pizza, she asked the kitchen if they would make it and they agreed to. Such great service and that was really appreciated!   The pizza was everything I hoped it would be. The crust was fluffy, the sauce savory, and the meatballs were fantastic. The ricotta cheese went perfectly with the meatballs and the banana peppers were the cherry on top. I'll be back for more.",

It's always been my weakness - I can't resist it.  That is until we got pizza from here.  This is a first for me - usually if I don't particularly love it I can doctor it up somehow with additional seasonings or crisp up the crust somehow to make it edible.  Unfortunately there was no help here. I thought it might've been the style we got but we had two different kinds NY style and Sicilian style - both were terrible and inedible.  The crust on both had no flavor and seemed like it wasn't cooked through. And the sauce tasted like what you get from an elementary school cafeteria and I can't finger it but it was either too sweet or possible slightly rotten.  I have never thrown pizza away till now and it made me incredibly sad.  Wings were not that great either.  I hate to leave a bad review but was sorely disappointed.",

I learned that if you come during the week for lunch they have a pizza and salad/soup bar for less than $7.00. The only type of pizza on the bar is cheese and pepperoni.  I decided to order a thin crust veggie pizza in the smallest size they had. I got my food fairly quickly. Normally you pay by the topping(s) but some come premade up which is what I got. I did learn that if I could not finish it then would wrap it up for me.  The pizza was okay. Nothing overly spectacular about it and I was amazed at the fact I was able to finish it. Probably since I had ordered a thin crust it wasn't quite as filling as I would have thought it to be. I did enjoy the vegetable toppings since they are my favorite.  My ice tea seemed a bit strong but it came with lemon and I was okay with it. They have a huge bar on one side along with TV sets.  They have other items on the menu but pizza is their specialty. Located in the heart of the Beverly business district in Mt Lebanon pay metered parking is available outside or in the lot behind the row of buildings on this side of Beverly Blvd.",

Two of my favorite non-pizza items here are the buffalo chicken hoagie and the reuben.  The reuben is one of the best in the area.    The pizza here is one of my favorites.  I go with the traditional crust.  It is thicker than places like Fioris or IVP, but the dough is fresh and cooked perfectly.  All of the ingredients they use seem to be high-quality and it makes for a great pizza.  Great place to come for lunch or dinner.  Also, their Tuesday buffet is a great bargain.  Make sure to show up early though because it gets packed.",

We decided to give it another chance whenever we moved right up the road, and I'm glad we did. We get takeout at least twice a month, and sometimes eat in too. They have a nice breakfast menu. Recently, they had a special that was egg nog French toast, and it was really good. Typically, we get lunch or dinner. I absolutely love their vodka sauce. I usually get the pene vodka add Italian sausage and it never disappoints. One thing they could work on is getting some real garlic bread. They use hoagie buns to make \"garlic toast\" and it's not very good and always over toasted.  Not sure why they don't use regular Italian bread. The hot Italian hoagie is pretty good, and my husband loves their pizza. Their house Italian dressing is delicious and the anti pasta salad is a great deal. I always get two meals out of it. Bados service is decent and they have a nice deck upstairs for out door eating whenever the weather is nice. If you're on beverly, give it a try.",

Tuesday night balloon guy and all you can eat pizza buffet $7 6-8pm. Nice modest music volume and atmosphere during Happy Hour, can get busy during rushes and metered parking lot costs (but not hard to find a space, meters take nickels, quarters, and credit cards). Also an upstairs party room and outdoor deck depending on weather.  Definitely recommend the Margherita pizza, with the buffalo mozzarella and fragrant fresh basil. Tonight I'm enjoying their signature Leopold Square Pizza with the amazing dough, lightly applied but flavorful marinara, sweet sauteed onions play great with the optional salty Anchovies to kick it up a notch (I get the fishies on the side because my wife doesn't like them, and Bado's accommodates). Seriously crave worthy pizza! I want to try the cannoli and Oreo waffle sundae sometime, but I always eat more pizza than I need and feel full, haha!",

The place is nice with a warm, inviting atmosphere.  Our server was friendly, but clearly dealing with to my tables. He actually made me feel anxious when he'd stop by! My family decided to split a traditional pizza with pepperoni and mushroom. My wife and I added a dozen Guinness/ Honey Mustard wings and split a Reuben.  The wings came out in record time and were pretty good. Although, I still don't think the Guinness aspect did anything for the flavor. They sure tasted like any other honey mustard wing I've ever had.  The Reuben was average, but very large. It came with potato chips and a pickle spear. For the $9 price tag, you'd think they could do fries over chips.  The pizza was good; not great. Based on reviews, I thought the pizza would be even better. Maybe I'm being a bit picky, but there are enough great pizza joints in the city that you can afford to be.  All in all, Bado's is a nice place to have a casual dinner. I wouldn't go out of my way to try it, but if you're local give it a go. If you want an inviting atmosphere where you can enjoy a beer, have some pizza and enjoy the company of friends or family, this won't disappoint.",

    "text": "Went there on 1/31 (Friday) with my wife & other family members. Finding a parking space was kind of a pain. For those who don't know, Beverly Road has a one block business area in the middle of a residential area & parking is at a premium. Had to wait about 20-25 minutes for a table, so we had a couple drinks. Large beer selection & good bartenders.  Before I get into the food, I wish to comment on the wait staff, which consisted of mostly people in their late teens-early 20s. Maybe it's the times we live in, but many people have a notion that people in this age range are lazy & don't care much about the work they're doing. These people are the exact opposite. They were pleasant, helpful, & were busting a hump on that evening. Great job, guys!  I ordered the Pastrami Swiss burger. It was large & juicy, cooked to order & tasted good, but could've used more pastrami. Fries on the side could've used a little more of a crisp, but were tasty (& I'm not a big fan of french fries). The pizza that my wife & our company ordered looked very good.",

    "text": "I stopped by Bado's on a recent Wednesday for an early dinner with a friend. When I first walked in, I was rather surprised at the decor. The way Bado's is talked about and with this prime location, I imagined it to be more modern. I was wrong. Inside, it is your typical neighborhood pizza place/bar. Clean, well maintained but nothing shiny or fancy here. Looking over the menu, I noticed some classics and some distinct choices. Sandwiches, soups, salads, pizzas and calzones. Some with toppings/fillings you would not expect. Feeling unadventurous, we decided to order their (famous) wedding soup, a cheese pizza and a sausage calzone to be able to try a few of the classics. The soup came out first. The meatballs were tasty but otherwise, I'm not sure why it would be famous. It definitely did not stand out to me. Another item that did not stand out, the pizza. I was looking for something more. The pizza sauce was a bit tart for me. The real winner of the meal was the sausage calzone (which we added ricotta to). The sausage had a great spice to it. The heat was nicely complimented by the creamy cheese and crisp crust. Overall, good food for a neighborhood bar.",

In my recent hungering for brewpubs with tasty food (and not just good beer), I was a little disappointed that dinner is mostly pizza and sandwiches, with just a few pasta entrees, but the burger I had was really tasty!  Thick and juicy and cooked the way I ordered, but the way you \"make your own\" is a slight downer; I'd like to see some gourmet-style suggestions like other places are doing lately.   The beer, however, is awesome. They have a great rotation on draft and lots to choose from. I didn't think the \"specials\" were anything that special price-wise, but the waiter had a long list of seasonal craft brews to choose from.   The service was great, the beer and food were delicious, but I think the menu could use a little more inspiration.",

Also like that the alcohol content is specified. The drawbacks are that the service can be slow, even during non-busy times, and it seems a bit pricey to me. I usually get pizza delivered from down the street with similar quality but for less money, so even though I live right behind Bado's, it's not my first choice unless I want to walk somewhere and have a couple of drinks with my pizza. Last time I was there with a friend the server brought us our second round without us saying we wanted the same thing as before, which was kind of unusual and we didn't get to try something else from the extensive draft/bottle list.",

The server wasn't at all pleasant - I felt like we were keeping him from something.  I wasn't at all impressed with the beer selection but in fairness, I lean heavily on German wheats and the only thing that caught my eye was Franziskaner.  The food.  Well, it wasn't horrible but it also didn't blow me away.  Passable for bar food I suppose, but if I wanted a good pie for the same money, I'd be at A'Pizza Badamo on Washington.  My daughter who is a pizza fanatic only had a slice and a half before calling it quits - she's the expert and it says volumes when she won't eat more than a slice and a half.  The kids tried and rejected the pasta we got them to try as well as there was no taste to the sauce.  All in all, very disappointing in our book.  I can't imagine that we will be returning and that's a bummer as I had heard really good things about this place.",

We draws us there is the pizza and beer. The pizza is always amazing, and they have a great selection of beers on tap and in bottles. If you want to taste a beer on tap, just ask and they will bring you a little to try. The waitress's working weekends are pretty fantastic. The guys that work during the work are so-so. I don't have any experience with the bartenders, as we always sit at a table and eat. The one drawback for me is how it's a bit \"too\" family friendly for me. I love children (work with them everyday!) but it seems that families here feel comfortable letting their children do whatever they want. Maybe it's because the environment already seems loud, parents feel they can let their children misbehave and it will go unnoticed. I frequent this restaurant, and this seems to be he case most weekday evenings and weekends.",

    "text": "When you find a consistent restaurant with good food near your home, you tend to visit that restaurant a lot. For me, my fallback, can't miss restaurant is Bado's. First off, the menu is huge- pizza, hoagies, pasta, sandwiches, big burgers, Boarshead hotdogs, and huge apps. Everything I have tried there so far has been above average, except maybe their lasagna which I found to be watery and tasteless. If you get a salad, make sure you try their house dressing. It's their own vinaigrette that comes in a Grolsh bottle and is by far one of the best dressings I've ever had. Make sure you try it on the giant antipasti salad (which you should split with someone), and pair that with one of their calzones (my favorite is the reuben calzone, but the meatball is excellent as well). Their pizza buffet is also good if you want to try a lot of different toppings.  If you're looking for a good beer, Bado's has a great selection of craft and microbrews on their huge board, and the choices are always changing. You will also want to come to Bado's on weekend mornings for their breakfast. The omelets are huge and they have tons of toppings to choose from, and the rest of their breakfast choices are above average. Even the coffee is good! The drawbacks to Bado's are that they're almost always busy, and tables are a little cramped. Expect to wait a few minutes when you get there, and don't expect stellar service. The wait staff is good but they're always busy, so you'll probably be waiting for a refill. Also, I like to have fries with my sandwich or burger, and while their fries are pretty good, they don't have them as a side. You have to order off their appetizer menu, and the order is too big for one person and pricey.",

They were excessively long, particularly for food service. I have experience in food service and dealing with health department requirements and just plain common sense. Fingernails are literally a hotbed of bacteria. I'm sure it was not sanitary under those nails but they were painted a bold color so if they were dirty she would never know it. Her nails were so long that they touched our plates and inside coffee cups. It was gross. So Bados, if you are reading this, please insist that your employees have short fingernails along with all the other sanitary practices you should follow when dealing with food.  We will go back of course. The food is too good to miss, we will just need a server who shows good hygiene practices for food service.",

It was literally a few cold pizzas layed out on a little table. No salad, no breadsticks with it. It'd actually to be better to order a large, fresh hot pizza and share it. The 'buffet' was for sure a let down.",

    "text": "Since discovering this gem in the heart of beloved Mount Lebanon/Upper St. Clair country 10 years ago when my husband and I were dating, I've been in love it with ever since.    Located in an attractive, pleasant area perfect for taking a stroll with a warm, relaxed, welcoming atmosphere inside that has anything you're looking for.    Chill at a table with company or enjoy the liveliness often available... It's all good.  We've been happy with everything Bado's offers; but our favorites are the delicious pizza (perfect for eat-in or take-out) and drinks.  If we lived close-by, we'd be regulars.  The folks of Bado's make you want to keep coming back... They go the extra mile.    George, in particular, made our day recently.  He went out of his way to help us and our family have an experience we'll never forget.  Thank you, George!  We don't have enough words for our gratitude!    Once again, we'll be smiling about Bado's for quite a while.  I miss this place.  If you're nearby, be sure to enjoy it.  We do.",

    "text": "I have enjoyed Bado's many times. The pizza is great, and wings are pretty good too. BUT the last three times the staff has been awful. I'm not usually one to complain, as I know waiting sucks and people are awful. But the attitudes of the staff: servers, host, and bar, are not what I would expect. The shortness, negativity and scoffing when we ordered are unacceptable. I try and give the benefit of the doubt, maybe it's a bad day but when the same server presents the same way multiple times its him, not us. I suggest take out, because the food is still good!",

Served fries on the side and bagged coleslaw. Fries were an afterthought due to the pickle found underneath.  watched a young waiter spill two drinks, or e on a customer.  Same waiter after avoiding a table with cash payment, waiting for them to leave so he could pocket the change, finally got them change, as soon as they left he pulled out his wallet and put the tip inside.So unprofessional. Food from a box and under trained staff. Not if they begged would I go back.",

    "text": "Meh. At best. So I went to Bado's tonight w/ my dad and sister and it was a bit lackluster. I started out with chicken noodle soup (w/ no noodles) and a very spicy bloody ( I know. I know. I am an avid evening bloody mary drinker.) The bloody mary was pretty awesome for what I assume is a pre-made mix. I also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell! Iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers, and dry swordfish. Lame. My dad got a meatball casserole which is something I would have never ordered...meatballs and casserole aren't a selling point for me, let alone as a package deal.  This meatball casserole dish was just pasta and meatballs...thankfully for my dads heart.   My sister got a salad (again just iceberg lettuce, croutons, cucumbers) with chicken fingers.  She also split a small mushroom pizza with my dad which was above average.   I guess pizza is what Bados is known for so you should just stick with that if you go.    Pro: Spicy bloody marys, decent pizza, cute waiter, wide beer selection Con: bland salads, noodleless noodle soups, not many healthy options, no dinner entrees besides pasta,",

    "text": "Hostess was very awkward when seating us. Sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. The place was by no means busy. We sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. We watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. After 15 minutes of being ignored by staff, we got up and walked out. It's a shame too... we liked the looks of the menu and the bar list and specials. Don't think we'd ever come back after that. There are plenty of other places.",
