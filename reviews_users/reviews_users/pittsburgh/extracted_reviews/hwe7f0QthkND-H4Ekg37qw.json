But it turns out that we didn't order chinese dumplings, but vegetarian dishes and lo and behold, they are pretty good.  Eggplant with garlic was just right.  The vegetarian paradise was a huge plate and excellent.  The vegetarian yellow bird was big tofu wrapped mushrooms, although it was a bit too salty.  The ma po tofu was silken tofu and nicely hot.  The hot and sour soup was neither hot or sour enough and needed green onions.  Overall, we thought the food was good.",

The restaurant was completely empty other than those working there and one guy who came in to pick up take-out as we were on our way out.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is underwhelming and actually makes the overall experience a bit unappetizing as does the fact that there are bowls of crispy wonton strips and uncovered containers of duck sauce and hot mustard out on every every table which made me question how fresh and sanitary that is.  My friend ordered green beans with brown sauce which was tasty but she ordered it medium spicy and it had no kick to it whatsoever.  I ordered vegetable pad thai but asked if I could also add tofu and the server said yes.  I also ordered it medium spicy.  My dish was bland and the noodles were undercooked.  The only \"vegetables\" in it were some shredded carrots and a small handful of what appeared to be canned mushrooms, which I picked out.  Overall the experience was just okay.  I would return if I was in the neighborhood and someone suggested it but will not make a special trip to eat there again.  My rating is actually more like 2.5 stars, but I'm feeling generous.",

Staff are kind and knowledgeable; they appreciate you business. But the food is very...plain. Nothing special comes out of this kitchen and sushi is the poorest you can get that is still alright. To be sure, you will be getting fatty tuna in lieu of tuna, dark meat chicken instead of white meat (you need to request white meat). Not worth finding a place to park other than you can shop at the record store located above the restaurant. Skip it unless you must have sushi NOW!!!!!!! Then get it.",

No carts with women yelling at you in Cantonese. I suppose the sweetness of the food is probably to appeal to American tastes?   Dim sum is marginally better than dinner, though I felt as though the servers resented us ordering it.   There are far better Chinese food options in the Squill.",

    "text": "It's an American Chinese restaurant that also has Japanese food, owned by a Taiwanese family. In addition to your typical American Chinese menu with a better than average set of Chef's specials, they also have Japanese entrees that come with miso soup and they have a sushi menu.  I like their deep fried dishes. Amazing Chicken is their white meat General Tso's chicken (I always like hunting for this on new Chinese restaurant menus) and is great. The shrimp egg rolls are different than the usual, they are deep fried spring rolls and they have mushrooms in them. You can even get various kinds of fake meat deep fried in sauce, if General Tso's tofu is your kind of thing.  It is definitely not the cheapest delivery Chinese in Pittsburgh, but this is the most solid delivery Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh. It's even nice to eat inside. And unfortunately, Pittsburgh does not have any incredibly cheap Chinese places that deliver. Let me know if I'm wrong...",

If you live in squirrel hill, this is your neighboorhood chinese place, period. If you are having a bad day, you should get the spare ribs, shrimp with broccoli, maybe some lo mein. It's the kind of place that's easy to take for granted because it's not in fact extraordinary or unique- until you find yourself looking for a well-priced chinese delivery place that is better than okay, that is actually very good.   They aren't easy to come by. I've moved around quite a bit over the years- new york state, pittsburgh, italy, florida, and now los angeles. Best food? italy. Best chinese delivery? Definitely new dumpling house. And not just delivery, it's actually a very comfy place to eat and close to all your squi-hi destinations.  I get cravings sometimes, especially for the vegan orange chicken-- and I'm not a vegan. I'm not even a vegetarian, I just shared it with a vegan friend once and was hooked. It's just like a really good orange chicken but kinda creamy in the middle and without any funny little cartiledge bits. mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.......",

You'd think that a place that promotes their dumplings in their name would have decent dumplings, and you'd be terribly, terribly wrong. My girlfriend and I ordered fried pork dumplings, Imperial dumplings, and two orders of Szechuan dumplings. The fried pork dumplings came in dough so thick that it was like eating a bun, and not a dumpling. The meat was heavy, dry, stringy, and salty. The Imperial dumplings skin was okay, but still below average. The meat was flavorless and dry. The Szechuan dumplings were more similar to wontons, which would have been fine, but they came drenched in sesame oil and covered with peanut satay sauce. They were not, as the restaurant said, spicy at all. The meat in the dumplings themselves were passable, but the sauce just killed the dish. This is to say nothing about the griminess and rudeness of the server.  Save yourself the experience; if you really want dumplings, Chinatown Inn has pretty good wontons late night.",

We went during lunch time and I was sorely disappointed by everything from the rude reception the taste in my mouth hours later, aside from the free crackers that come on every table.  The sushi options sound nice on the menu, but the quality of the fish was not high enough for how long the fish had obviously been sitting in the back. (The freshest sushi I've found, at a low price, has been at Tokyo and Whole Foods, though the latter puts way too much avocado in everything) Finally, when we went to pay the man at the counter was kind of snippy for no reason, again. Apparently, other people enjoy this place, but I can't afford to pay for crappy sushi twice just to find out if it was a one time deal.",

It wasn't memorable. It wasn't bad, it wasn't particularly good.  It doesn't come out on carts ( I have yet to find a place that has cart dim sum in Pittsburgh). Instead, you order small plates from a menu in one big batch.   Compared to the dim sum I've had in my lifetime (Rockville/D.C. and the Bay Area/CA), it would get two stars.   I don't think there are many places that serve dim sum in Pittsburgh though, so in that case, it probably deserves four stars on Pittsburgh standards. Which means, I average to three stars...",

Just three type of dumplings only three!!! and they were green, don't know if that is authentic but definitely not what I'm used to. Ordered the veg dumplings, chicken lomein, and chicken hot pot all of these dishes were terrible, terrible in the sense no taste no flavour below mediocre Chinese food. My two year old could probably do a better job cooking flavourful Chinese fare service was ok but not attentive we caught her eating in the back not doing her job.

    "text": "We have been here several times and every time its a great meal. It is a bit on the expensive side but its the best sushi I've had in Pittsburgh. I moved here from Honolulu where you can get good to excellent sushi pretty much on every other corner. This is about as good as sushi gets here in the midwest.  The menu is huge. There's a large selection of Chinese and Japanese as well as sushi. We've never tried any of the Chinese food, thought it always looks good. It has many vegetarian choices plus they can make any meat dish with soy protein, which is cool. I'm not a vegetarian but its always nice to see.  The service could be better. There's always a language barrier, which I don't mind. Living in Honolulu, I was quite used to speaking with others who might not share my first language. Its not that bad when I can't understand the server that well. As long as my food gets to me how I ordered it, everyone's happy. But we have had experiences when the server did not understand us well enough to take our orders. They are always very friendly with smiles and water glasses that are always full.   In addition to the regular menu, there's always in insert with the Sushi Chef's specialties. There are a variety of salads, special appetizers and sushi. We've tried a few of the salads and they're delicious (though very expensive, 5 bucks for a side salad basically). The specialty rolls are good though they're expensive as well, 10-15 bucks a piece.  Their regular sushi menu has plenty of decently priced rolls. Veggie rolls are all under 5 bucks. And the rest are between 5 and 8 bucks. You can get a large platter of sushi with 30 pieces or so for 30 dollars easily. Like their regular menu, there's a large variety of vegetarian choices.  This time we got 4 maki rolls, one hand roll and some sashimi. Like I said, I used to live in Honolulu. The restaurant I worked at was delivered fresh ahi daily by a fisherman. He would mark on the styrofoam contained when the fish was pulled out the water. The fish we served was rarely ever more than 24 hours away from swimming in the water.  I've tried sashimi at a few other places here in Pittsbrugh....Yokoso and Nakama. I'm not sure what those two places are doing wrong but The Dumpling House is doing it right. The fish was as delicate as it was delicious.  We also got one of the speciality salads..about six stalks of asparagus sliced on a bias drenched in sesame oil and mayonnaise. It was tasty but over-priced...5 bucks for six stalks of asparagus.  I also got a wonton soup. While I haven't had alot of wonton soup in Pittsburgh, their soup was great. I got two strawberry sized wontons in a clear, tasty broth. The wonton wrapper was light, not chewy. There was plenty of pork inside the wonton and they add shredded pork on top of the soup itself.  I did not know they had dim sum. I will most certainly have to go in sometime to try it!",

Pretty good prices too. Places that deliver are sometimes hard to find here in the ' burgh, so this place is a nice, solid choice for safe, not too crazy or over the top food.",

    "text": "New Dumpling House can best be described as a go to place when you want Chinese food to go.  It's the kind of place you order from when you and your significant other are staying in on a Saturday night.  My husband Rick and I were doing just that, winding down our Halloween horror movie fest in our Netflix queue.  New Dumpling House is best when you stick to the basics--you know, Americanized Chinese food.  Whereas Rick went for the Kung Pao Chicken, my tastes generally run towards more milder food.  I went with my old standby, chicken with snow peas.  And of course we had egg drop soup and egg rolls for appetizers!    Well like I said, this place isn't very original and I highly advise sticking with the basics.  But the food was the perfect accoutrement for watching the original \"Frankenstein\" and \"Bride of Frankenstein\".",

    "text": "\"It's irony when \"Dumpling\" is in the name of the restaurant and the dumplings they serve are just so awful... right?\"  That's what my wife and I were lamenting to each other after our first and only visit to the New Dumpling House.  With a craving for dim sum, my family and I set out for Squirrel Hill to check out the special weekend menu at New Dumpling House.  Boy, were we disappointed.  We had very high hopes with a special dim sum menu only offered on Friday, Saturday and Sunday afternoons.  With items of names we recognize like siu mai, fried bean curd roll (with shrimp even!), red bean buns and on and on.    Service was a bit odd.  The place for a Saturday lunch service wasn't all that busy.  There were 2 servers for the restaurant with only about 3 or 4 tables taken up.  We could not understand why it took so long for our waiter to greet us, get us a dim sum menu and then for the food to arrive.  There were crispy noodles with sweet and sour sauce and hot mustard already on the table when we arrived.  Totally a throw back to the 70s and 80s for me going to the Chinese restaurant in our neighborhood.  The crispy noodles that were free with our meal was probably the 2nd best thing on our table according to my wife - I totally agree.  When the crispy noodles were gone, the food arrived.  And again, it was a huge disappointment all around.  Here's how it all went down:  * siu mai - microscopic portions of 4 dumplings, tasted just a little bit off which is not good considering it's pork and shrimp. * steamed BBQ pork bun - the wrapper just looked plastic - my wife tells me the filling was good. * steamed red bean bun - the filling was OK, wrapper was a problem * sichuan dumplings in hot sesame sauce - the dumpling filling was good, the wrapper had the consistency of mucus and the \"hot sesame sauce\" was basically creamy peanut butter. * crispy bean curd roll - the shrimp was a surprise, but this was by far the only decent thing we ordered.  It wasn't great enough to have us come back, but at least something was decent.    Though we were lured in with the promise of dim sum with a special menu and all, we left New Dumpling House $20 lighter.  The price was right but we won't be returning.  The search for dim sum in Pittsburgh rolls on...",

I had the combo sushi rolls and was surprised to get soup and a salad as part of the meal. I thought I was only paging for the sushi. I had the whole dinner for $16.

    "text": "We ordered takeout from here last week, for part 7 of our \"Try every Chinese restaurant in Squirrel Hill\" challenge.  And sadly, NDH has landed toward the bottom of the pack.  The food was ready when they said it would be, and we brought it merrily back to our apartment.  And here is what we got:  Szechuan Dumplings in Hot Sesame Sauce:  What?  This dish did not in any way resemble its advertised qualities.  The dumplings were essentially firm balls of pork, wrapped in flimsy dumpling wrappers, and coated in what tasted much more like a peanut sauce than a \"hot sesame sauce.\"  The dish looked sloppy and tasted okay...for hard pork ball dumplings in peanut sauce.  Which is not what we wanted, so yeah.  No.  Yaki Udon: This dish did arrive as advertised, in that it had scallops, shrimp, vegetables, and noodles.  But I just found it really bland, lacking the delicious savory umami quality that makes me want to slurp up the whole bowl.  Seafood was a little tough in texture, and the \"vegetables\" were essentially grated strips of carrot tossed in.  That was disappointing since part of why I ordered this was because I wanted some vegetables in the dish.  Again, no.  General Tso's Chicken: This is hard to mess up, and they didn't.  Crispy, sweet, sticky chicken with a few bits of broccoli in there for good measure.  Lots and lots of sauce.  So frankly, nothing exciting to report, just a Chinese-American standard.  All in all, too pricey for what it was, the ingredients seemed low-quality, and there was nothing super delicious at all.  Mostly blah.  We probably won't be back.",

We ordered tofu and black mushrooms and it was inedible (not that they cared). Sweet beyond belief in a sauce that was clearly from a mix or jar. The Moo shu used to be good but we've had it a couple of times recently and it gets worse and worse, greasier and less taste.   They seem to have started just adding sugar and grease to their food. I would bet that their cooks have gone and they have hired inexperienced people who don't know what they are doing. Also, their servers need to learn some skills, I tried VERY hard to order steamed fish there and they REFUSED to serve it to me claiming that as an \"American\" I wouldn't \"Like\" it. F--- you, I'm NOT an American and yes I DO LIKE steamed fish. I was so frustrated and it was a family dinner that I ordered the sashimi hoping to avoid the sugar and condescension. It was okay sashimi but clearly not very fresh.",

In all fairness, my rating hovers somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, but I'm more inclined to lean towards 4, if only because my feelings toward this restaurant are sort of indifferent, and others have really liked the dumplings I ordered.   The atmosphere, while alright, was kind of affected by the fact that there was nobody else in the restaurant. I ordered their house salad (with a ginger dressing), a vegetable egg roll, and my friend and I ordered 3 orders of vegetable dumplings (despite being appetizers, they're fairly big!).   I thought the egg roll was quite good, and they had a generous serving of spicy mustard and duck sauce already on the table. The salad was alright, but a little wilted. As for the dumplings, reactions were a bit mixed. I thought they were just alright (perhaps the non-vegetable egg rolls are a bit better), but my friend really liked them.  Service was fairly good. I think the waiter had a little bit of trouble understanding some of what we were saying/ordering, but that did not factor that into my rating. If you're thinking of trying the New Dumpling House for the first time, I would give this restaurant a shot. It did not, however, stand out.",

Being from Houston and having a huge Chinatown with endless options for dim sum and Chinese food, I expected a lot from this place. I've lived in Pittsburgh for almost 3 years now and was missing good authentic Chinese food. I was hopeful for a decent meal, but wow was I disappointed. Their dim sum tasted like it was frozen, bought from the frozen food section of the Asian grocery store. The rice noodles were like cardboard and so bland. The wrapping on the dumplings were way too thick and way too chewy.  I have to put this meal as one of the worst I've ever had.  And to make things worse, the place looks like it's straight out of the 70's or early 80's.  With the word \"new\" in their name, I expected a more updated restaurant.  Needless to say, I won't be going back!",

This staple of Squirrel Hill has been around for over 20 years, and many of us locals grew up seeing friends and neighbors on a Friday evening at \"The Dumpling House\".  The restaurant was sold to new owners about a year or so ago, and they've really breathed some new energy into this place.  They probably deserve closer to 3.5 stars since the decor and restaurant is still pretty outdated, but decided to review and give them kudos for really bring the quality of the food way back to wear it used to be.  The sushi is fresh, well made, and the Chinese is tasty good old fashioned American-Chinese food.  They also have a small \"authentic\" menu which I've never tried because honestly go elsewhere when thats what I'm looking for.  As some other reviewers have suggested, despite the name, the dumplings are definitely not their strong suit.  Happy to see the restaurant providing good quality food that they used to provided years ago!",

We were seated quickly, and the menu was extensive--for those who don't know, like us when we arrived, their lunch specials last until 3 PM, and the \"for two\" and large soups are the exact same size, enough for around 3-4 small bowls. The portion sizes are fairly generous, and the prices are reasonable. The waitress we had was friendly and knowledgeable, and quick to answer questions/help us with anything we needed; she came by several times during the meal, attentive without hovering like so many waitresses do.  The food came quickly, and was hot and fresh--large bowls of hot and sour and velvet corn soup, a plate of pickled Japanese vegetables, a plate of salt and pepper squid, three orders of house dumplings, (steamed chicken, steamed veggie, and fried pork) a Shirley Temple with ginger ale, and a pot of hot black tea. Everything was very good, but not blow-me-away spectacular; the dumplings were a bit sticky and needed to be washed down with a drink, (the True sign of fresh, home-made dumplings) and the squid was a bit salty, but with nicely light and fluffy breading. I thought the chicken dumplings were better than the veggie ones, personally, and really liked the velvet corn soup.  Reading other reviews, I've noticed that older ratings tend to be lower, and that a change in management has been mentioned--so personally, I would take older reviews with a grain of salt. A solid, respectable choice!",

Their lunch special consisted of the entree, rice, soup or a spring roll and a fortune cookie. Everything was really good. For somebody who isn't crazy for Chinese, it was a good dish. The sauce wasn't overwhelming and the rice was cooked just right. I wasn't a big fan of the spring roll, but that's just my taste buds.   The reason I'm giving this four stars is for the value.

Their portions are huge, and the quality of seafood/neat they use is good. I ordered the Singapore fried noodles, which was really good! And my boyfriend had the Hunan chicken - also good. Our Chinese dishes arrived first, and we finished them before the sushi arrived, I think there was some problem with the sushi chef? The waitress apologized. The roll that we had was good.  Second time we went was two days ago. My boyfriend ordered the hot and sour soup, which was forgettable. I ordered the Singapore noodles again and he had the three treasure seafood. Both very good!   Service wise, this place is pretty fuss free. I like it - they don't bother you all the time. Don't expect typical American service.  Ambience, nothing to shout about, but clean and comfortable.  Overall, I would keep going back for the noodles, and maybe when I'm feeling adventurous, I will try something else. It's hard to be ambitious when I've had so many bad experiences with Asian food in Pittsburgh.",

The only suggestion I'd make is two of us ordered entrees and they gave us one large container of rice. For people wanting to take home leftovers, it's not very considerate. Also they only included one pack of silverware for two entrees. Other than that the food was pretty good.",

    "text": "Not having formal website like many restaurants do in 2014, New Dumpling House is an understated Chinese restaurant in Pittsburgh's Squirrel Hill neighborhood.  Dining here for a dear friend's birthday, we had a group of 6.  Reservations were made ahead of time.  The restaurant manager (possible owner) was visibly busy at the cash register, so I attempted to walk into the next room and find.  The manager aggressively asked me to \"WAIT\" and that he would assist ME following whatever task he was completing.  I was taken aback by his tone, as I was coming off of the zen of an afternoon nap.  I shockingly learned I was the first of my party (SHOCKER) and was escorted to my seat in the moderately busy dining room.  Imagine me being rushed to a table for 6 and then having to wait about 7 minutes for anyone to arrive.  #AWKWARD #IHATEBEINGEARLY  I found out later that the reservation asked that we sit in a specific area per the birthday boy, but this was overlooked.   Several instances of spotty service seemed to accent the night.  Before I continue, I must say (not because I am a nice and positive person) that the quality of the sushi, drinks, soup and salad was excellent.  Our actual server was overwhelmed due to a call-off (explained to me in the abovementioned gibberish comment), which led to a delay in our initial drink order (like 15 minutes before we got our first round).  To our server's defense, his kind spirit that exuded much forgiveness and understanding from us.  The nail in the coffin on this experience was a disagreement between the cash collected by the group (the restaurant would not split our check) and what was actually given back in change.  Frustrated, we were also concerned that the waiter would be shortchanged via his tip.  So sad.  I am not sure if I will go back, as service is very important to one's dining experience.  However, if it is with this group, then I can make it through any event in life.  Happy birthday DOUG!  Oh, we night-capped at The Squirrel Hill Cafe.",

We always have leftovers from all the food you get. Sometimes I feel that the quality of the food varies but we prefer it to How lee's up the street. I always get the chicken and broccoli and it definitely has more flavor than How Lee's chicken and broccoli. My husband has had General tsos, which is ok. He's also had the crispy chicken and amazing chicken which were both very delicious.   Their eggs rolls are very tasty but at times they are too greasy.  And the service is just ok. I can hardly understand them at times which makes it hard to order over the phone and they do not seem super welcoming.  In the end, my husband and I will keep getting take out here because it's convenient and it really is tasty with the occasional disappointment.",

I have only tried the vegetarian sushi, but it has all been good.  They have a pretty extensive cocktail menu as well. I recommend the zombie. The staff has always been very friendly and attentive.

He told me that he needed a new card because the one they have on file was EXPIRED.  I can't tell you how many times I have told these people NOT TO STORE MY CREDIT CARD and they still do it.

    "text": "My experience at New Dumpling and Sushi House makes writing this review challenging. My party of two showed up around 9PM Friday night and we're told to choose a seat. Our server quickly took our drink orders and brought us sake and ice water. After scanning the menu, we decided to try the sushi sampler for two.   When our miso soup was brought out, we immediately noticed that the broth was much darker than miso soup usually is. I tried a few spoonfuls but immediately regretted it because it turns out that we were being served the dregs of the day's miso soup which were essentially overcooked seaweed, mushy tofu and about 8000% of our daily sodium intake.  Our waiter brought out the salad next, which was also a complete miss. The carrot ginger dressing and iceberg lettuce salad is hard to mess up, but New Dumpling and Sushi House somehow made this inedible as well. After two bites, the puddle at the bottom of my bowl put me off. It seems as though the greens weren't drained after rinsing and the dressing wasn't mixed again before going over our salads.   When our server returned, we explained the issues we were having with our soup and salad. The server was apologetic and thanked us for our feedback, but at this point, my dining partner was ready to leave and get other food. Morbid curiosity won out, however, and we stayed for our sushi entree.   Somehow, after presenting the worst salad and miso soup we'd ever seen, New Dumpling and Sushi House presented is with a decent plate of sushi. The sashimi was quite delicious, and my dining partner contends that it may be some of the best tuna and surf clam he's experienced in Pittsburgh. The house special roll was okay but had a lot of mayo-based sauce.   The bottom line: I can't recommend New Dumpling and Sushi House at this point because there is such inconsistency in quality between dishes. If servers get soup and salads for diners, they need to receive remedial training on the basics.",

It took a lot of time at every step - greeting, drinks, refills, food, check.   She spent part of the time complaining that a table walked out on their check.  While that completely sucks and I felt for her, I can kind of see how it happened because it took a long time to get ours.     The food was overall pretty bland and uninteresting.  My boyfriend ordered extra spicy and was issued a warning, but his was bland too.   They do have some nice extras (sour cucumbers and sliced oranges), but it isn't enough to make me want to eat in with the depressing decor and iffy service.     The kicker for me though was the bathroom.  It was DISGUSTING!  Looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a month and had some serious disrepair.  Every sheet of wallpaper was falling off, all the corners of the floor were black, the sink was filthy and missing part of a handle, etc.  My favorite part was that in an attempt to correct a sewer gas smell coming up from a floor drain, they glued a plastic to-go container lid to the floor over the top of the drain.  Gross.  If the public bathroom looks like that, I can only image what the kitchen looks like.  There are plenty of other options in Squirrel Hill, so I'm going to pass on this one.",

    "text": "My favorite Chinese restaurant!!! They can make just about any menu item vegan or vegetarian with veggie \"chicken/pork/beef\"!! I love their sushi, especially avocado rolls and tofu skins. My favorite dish is their general tsos \"veggie chicken\". They also have super reasonable lunch specials. Service is fast and prices are affordable. Definitely recommend to everyone.",

    "text": "To hear my friend tell it, this used to be his after school stomping grounds when he was at Alderdice. I was excited to take a trip down memory lane because I hold his opinion in high regard. The only problem with this is that my friend graduated high school in the 90s, and this place doesn't look like it's been remodeled (and in some places, thoroughly cleaned) since the 80s.   We walked in and were greeted by a guy in jeans, a t-shirt, and a windbreaker who asked us if we wanted to sit down. Confused by the guy who didn't seem to be in any sort of uniform and didn't look at all like he worked in a Chinese restaurant, I cautiously said yes and he grabbed two menus and told us to choose anywhere.   Once sat, I visited the bathrooms that were another trip down memory lane. They were mostly clean, although it didn't look like it had been scrubbed in awhile. I washed my hands and moved on. The waitress bought over tea in a dirty teapot so I did not partake of it. She was friendly and the only server on the floor, but her timing took entirely too long. At one point she came back to our table smelling like cigarettes.   The food was good, save for the szechuan dumplings. They were glorified gyoza in chili oil/soy sauce. They don't taste of anything, and I wasn't a fan of the presentation. The steamed shrimp dumplings were excellent, smoky, and everything I want in dumplings.   My friend and I split a chirasa platter and chow fun noodles. Both are delicious, though the noodles were a tad too greasy. I've come to expect that from Chinese places, so it wasn't that big of a deal. The fish tasted good but some of it was very very cold, almost as if it juuuuust got done being thawed out. Odd.   I didn't like the service or the ambiance, so I doubt I'd eat in again. I may get takeout, but there are so many other good places that I wouldn't limit myself.",
