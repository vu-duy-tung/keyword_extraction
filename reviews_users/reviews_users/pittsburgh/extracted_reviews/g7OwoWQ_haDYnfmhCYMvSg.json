The panini's are great and the wraps are not half bad either. I got way more than what I paid for and felt like it was a great value.  I spoke with the owner who was behind the counter and he seems like a very nice guy. The guy in front of me in line apparently had his order messed up and the owner was kind enough to fix it and give it to him free of charge. Cool little local place and a great way to support local businesses.   They have no seating. The owner told me when he bought the building, the Crazy Mocha coffee shop that is next door bought the bathrooms so because of health codes, he is not allowed to have seating. TAKE OUT ONLY!!",

There is a good reason for this, the food is fresh and tasty, the staff is friendly and efficient, and the prices are very low for the level of quality. Pittsburgh is rife with restaurants that utilize poor ingredients towards creating a poorer product. The Deli on Butler is night and day different when compared with those and stands out to me as one of the few bright spots in Pittsburgh's dining community. Gary the owner, clearly takes pride in his business and it shows in both the level of cleanliness of his establishment and in the product he delivers.

I love their sandwiches AND their subs. As I said before, they're piled high but they're also on amazing bread. Their Italian bread is crusty and chewy and their subs feel fresh baked. The ingredients are premium and in abundance and everyone is friendly and easy to talk to.  My only complaint would be their chip selection. It's scant and they only have Lays brand. They need to get a more gourmet selection, preferrably of the kettle variety. A bag of Lays doesn't mesh well enough with the quality of their sandwiches.",

Staff is noticeably friendly, prices are wallet friendly, and they do not skimp!!! Love the pickle all wrapped up on the side to keep it separate. Totally solid and my new favorite place. I want to try everything!!!!",

The only complaint is how crowded it is, since it's no longer the best kept secret. Order ahead if you're on a time crunch. I really enjoy the Cob on Bread. Avocado, blue cheese crumbles, boars head chicken breast, lettuce, tomato and as if that wasn't enough.... BACON! All on freshly baked italian bread. Yum! Today I also had the Caesar salad, which was fine. Try it out if you're in the neighborhood. Definitely recommend!",

I went in and there was a very long wait to get served.  When I asked the cashier for 1/2 pounds of deli meats he almost seemed annoyed that I was just ordering meat!  He stares at me like I had horns growing out of my face!  I had to break the trance by saying \"you do that right?\".  Confirming that I was in fact in a deli and that they did in fact have meat to sell.  Then it took way too long to get my order, and the customer service was crap.  There are plenty other places that I could go to get way better service, so I think I'll go anywhere else next time.",

When four people behind the counter can't manage to handle two customers, that's the sort of service I expect at the Wendy's across the street. The food is good, but the wait can be really long if you're on a lunch break. I've put more hustle into it when I ran a deli counter. It also bothers me that there's no seating. I can't sit down to eat? That's not a lunch break to me.   I would give the place three stars, because the food is definitely good, but this site says three stars is 'A-OK'.

The Deli is a cute little place; I've walked past here many times and I've never stopped by. I'm so glad that my roomie and I did today! There is no seating inside unfortunately, but the owners let us know that we could sit over at the Crazy Mocha if we wanted to, which is nice. A lot of things looked good on the menu, but I decided on the brisket sandwich. It was absolutely delightful. The meat was tender and extremely flavorful, and the barbecue sauce on it was delicious! The bread was toasted to perfection. I did get the coleslaw on the side (it usually comes on the sandwich), and it was one of the only coleslaws I have ever liked. I was very impressed! My roomie got the chicken Caesar salad wrap, which she thoroughly enjoyed as well.  My one complaint is the hours. I really, really wish they could be open for dinner once or twice a week. At this point due to my work schedule I am restricted to coming here only for Saturday lunch...and I really would like to have a few options to come more often than that! It's really that good. Hopefully I can make it back here soon for another scrumptious sandwich!",

    "text": "Their sandwiches are very solid, especially for the price point.  A great place to grab lunch!  They sell boar's head meat by the pound for a very reasonable price (for example, the roast turkey is cheaper and better tasting than what you get at Smallman Deli) and sliced cheese as well.  The people are friendly, and I have never had a bad experience picking up deli stuff here.",

    "text": "D on B is hit and miss. I think the paninis and wraps are a highlight and I love that they have a large selection of Dietz and Watson meats. This place is a relative bargin for a sandwich when u compare to the likes of Panera. While there is a lot of potential here, a number of items fall short. Their soups are straight awful and taste like canned/frozen I get in a cafeteria. The deli salads are generally bland as they taste like straight mayo and no seasoning. Being classic is fine but it also gets boring after awhile. Hoagies are too dry and the bread they use is not that good-I would stay away.   Their hours also suck. Why are you not open on Sunday? This isn't 1950. In the end, i think 3 stars is fair for a generally average product. Lets be honest-making a deli sandwich with a commercial product isn't difficult to do. If the ownership stepped up and worked harder to produce a more quality \"homemade\" product this place could be so much more in a city of generally below average embarrassingly bad delis.",

Our orders have NEVER been messed up or lacking quality. Ive catered as little as 20 people to as much as 70 people as of today. It doesn't matter if its 20 or 70 they are ALWAYS willing to work with me and appreciate the business we give them.   Also, EVERYTHING they have is great. They know what theyre doing and I've never had a single complaint... even from the pickiest of eaters.  I love this place.",

Anyway, me and the crew keep coming back, 2 years and going strong.",

The panini was alright, almost lacking taste and greasy. I tried a half of the veggie wrap that was a left over the next day, that was way better than both my original items.",

    "text": "Chicken cobb sandwich was AMAZING. From the description it sounds like it would be a salty, sloppy mess but it absolutely is not. There is the perfect amount of everything.  the Italian bread held up like a champion to all the ingredients, without losing an ounce of its delicious integrity.  It honestly reminded me a lot of Panera Bread, but cheaper and better.  the Italian wedding soup was also fantastic. nice and simple, with plenty of meatballs but not too much or too little of everything.  We ordered from grubhub. Upon delivery the soup was still hot and the sandwich still cold. It made a fantastic lunch. Will definitely order again!",

They took my order quickly and it was made in a decent amount of time, especially for how busy it was. When waiting for my order, you could hear the banter between customers and the people working there. It was nice to see so many people who are regulars stopping in and having a good time with the staff.  Brought my sandwich home since I also picked one up for the SO. It had a great amount of meat (I got the Chicken cordon bleu panini) and was pretty good for a sandwich. Will be coming here again this week.",

I do wish hey had a bigger bread selection, including a French roll or Baguette instead of just sliced bread. A bit pricey for a sandwich with no drink or sides besides a pickle. Also no seating available when I was there so you have to take it to go.",
