Not special inside, if your thinking of eating in.. florescent lights overhead seem to warp space and time, amid their collection of Chinese artifacts. But Dang the food is amazing, get an egg roll no matter what. The prices are fair market value for Chinese take-out. I've had a handful of different dishes and all have been very impressive. If your nearby and looking for Chinese, give them a call, and get yourself ready for a mouthful of Wang's!",

For our second experience with this restaurant, my husband ordered Mongolian Beef, but they gave him chicken instead. The third time I ordered from them I got lectured about not telling them I had a coupon when I placed my order. I don't think I'll be ordering from them again...

    "text": "As far as American-Chinese delivery-type food goes (and I am a huge fan of this genre), this is one of the best places I've been to in a long time. This place is mostly take-out or delivery but has some limited seating indoors. It does have a hole-in-the-wall vibe inside, but it is still clean and sanitary. I didn't eat-in, but I wouldn't be afraid to do so. As an added bonus, the woman who took my order over the phone spoke perfect English. Just a small thing, but it was a little less stressful ordering over the phone without the added worry of a language barrier.   I ordered the crab rangoon and was really pleased. These are the triangle-shaped ones, and they were some of the best I have ever had, though it's hard to explain why. The dough seems a bit thicker than what I'm used to but it works because the rangoons themselves seemed to be more fully stuffed. The thicker dough makes for a chewy center and crispy outside. They are perfectly fried and crispy--no heat lamp rubber texture or burnt crust on these guys. There is nothing particularly different about these rangoons, they are just done right all the way, and it totally pays off.   As I always do at these places, I ordered a dish with garlic sauce. In this case, it was shrimp with garlic sauce. The sauce was as expected, sweet and garlic-y with a slight spicy kick. The vegetables were superb. I notice with this type of food the vegetables are often limp and flavorless, functioning chiefly as a vessel to delivery gobs of sauce into your pie hole. Not so at Wang's, however. All the vegetables maintain an appropriate level of crunchiness and flavor. I remember exclaiming to my boyfriend, \"I can taste the flavor of the different vegetables!\" They are still cooked, but just not cooked to death. I think They probably make food to order, because I ordered close to closing and there was no indication that my food had been swimming in sauce for hours. The shrimp was also great--decent portion, good size, perfectly cooked  The prices at this place are pretty standard, if not a little lower than comparable restaurants. Overall I was really impressed and can't wait to go back.",

HOWEVER, my first time at Wang's, and ordering delivery none the less was great!  The crab rangoons...honestly, some of the best that I've tasted in a LONG time!  They were huge, sweet, and delicious!    I also got the sesame chicken...which was good.  I say good, because something that's fried and covered in a sauce never travels well (my own mistake for ordering it), but overall the best delivery Chinese food I've had in a long time!  One thing to note though, it was dark chicken meat.  Overall, I really enjoyed Wang's!  The food was good, fairly priced, and they deliver to my house!  Win/win/win!",

The egg roll was perfect and crunchy.  The Lo Mein was a little on the bland side with very little beside noodles and chicken, and so we'll ask for more veggies next time.  The General Tso's sauce tasted closer to a Sweet & Sour sauce than a sweet, slightly spicy sauce, which is likely my preference and restaurant recipe differences.  The chicken breading was thick and soggy, but they were kind enough to accommodate my request for all white-meat chicken. Portion size was standard, and delivery was quick (under 20 minutes).  Price was typical as well.  So, if you're looking for basic, quick cuisine, you'll find it in this place.",

Yelp must not have been around back then to keep track.    This place is not a fine dining establishment and I've never dined in as it's just your average unassuming chinese joint.  That being said, we ordered from them one night expecting your typical average - below average experience but were pleasantly surprised.  As everyone has said, the General Tsos is quite good but nothing incredible.  From there, things only got better.  Their egg rolls are perfectly done and crispy.  The crab rangoons were outstanding.  But the real show stopper to me were the Chicken Teriyaki sticks.  These things transported me to a street vendor in Shanghai with every bite.  Sweet, salty, smokey.  These things were juicy inside and crispy and delicious outside.  Order them and thank me later.    Oh, one last thing the beef and broccoli was mediocre at best.

I especially like their crab Rangoon (loaded with cream cheese so don't expect crab filled ones like you'd get in Baltimore). Food is never super greasy. Fried rice is just rice, onions, and meat/shrimp so not packed with veggies (for me it's perfect with just rice and chicken- I don't like raw onion). Husband likes to try something different most of the time and has never been disappointed but his comfort go-to is the Singapore Mai fun. Service is always super quick- they say 45 min but are always here in under 20. Love this place!",

I have learned what to stay away from, so I will continue to order from Wang's, but I'm terrified to try anything new, so I more than likely won't.

However, it is consistently prepared correctly and arrives hot. Fried foods such as egg rolls arrive hot and crispy, which is hard to find with delivery. They will accomodate special requests such as extra spicy, no mushrooms, etc. My personal favorites are the hot and sour soup, General Tso's chicken, and vegetable Mai Fun. I've been ordering from here once or twice a month for several years and not had any bad experiences. Basic chinese takeout fare; but they do a great job in the kitchen and in regards to service. 4 stars because there is nothing unique or especially spectacular on the menu.",

Wang's Shrimp Egg Rolls are a tightly-packed, deep-fried delight. Their Chicken Teriyaki sticks are savory street food of an exemplary nature. Beef Fried Rice is another dish they make adeptly as tender chunks of beef hide within the lighter-than-air rice like carnivoric treasures. Fat like pierogi, wide like winged, extraterrestrial ships, the restaurant's Fried Pork Dumplings stand up against the boiled variety I had last night at Station Square's Sesame Inn but in a completely different way. Sesame Inn's are polite, delicate; Wang's are down and dirty like a gang of surly, suppressed steel workers turned striking, street fighting revolutionaries.   The real story, however, centers around something mystical called Singapore Mei Fun, and was it ever Fun for My mouth. Curry dusted rice noodles weave a web in which succulent, sublimely cooked baby shrimp and chicken bits are hopelessly caught. Richness and delectability supervenes.    P.S. The minimum order for delivery is $8. The minimum charge for credit cards is $10. Dine-in seating is very limited.",

Fresh garlic and ginger used in sauces.  I recommend the chicken with broccoli. My sister Vi said their shrimp and broccoli is \"astounding\" and that overall, \"The food is of a gourmet caliber!\" I agree, you really are getting a great value for the price. Our meal of two dishes, hot & sour soup and crab rangoon was $23. You can easily pay 20% or even 50% more at other restaurants in the city and the food isn't even nearly as good.   I must make a particular mention of the hot & sour soup. Making this soup is truly an art and out of the literally dozens of places in the city where I've tried it none compare to Wang's Kitchen. The perfect balance between sour and spicy, the perfect viscosity of the soup base - neither too gelatinous nor too watery, just the right amount of salt and the ample amount of Chinese mushrooms makes it just magnificent. Be sure to get the crispy fried noodles to eat with your hot & sour soup!  4 stars for Wang's Kitchen!",

I think the kicker that made this place amazing for me is that I called on a Sunday night  at 9:35 and asked when they stopped delivering. They told me 10:00 but were more than happy to deliver at that time! For that, I will forever be a failthful customer! Amazing service!",

    "text": "I must say I do appreciate the newer location closer to the borough building, and my house, rather than where Wangs used to be near Burger King in Brentwood. I have to say that there isn't much different here than any other Chinese restaurant. I wouldn't eat in here it's more of a take out or delivery style. Orders are always 10 minutes and due to the location it is great for me when wanting Chinese quickly. The prices are average, typical $7-15.   My main reason for only 3 stars is the staff here isn't very personable. The service is sort of shove your plastic bag with your food in it in front of you, give your total and give money. The woman there almost everytime I've been there isn't very friendly and very expressionless. Just seems cold to me as if unappreciative of customers. I think it would make the customer's experience more pleasant with better, friendlier service as well as make you want to come back to the restaurant. Otherwise the food is good and quickly put together.",

We dined in, although it looks like most folks do take out or get it delivered.  The dining area was very clean, but the food was served on a thin styrofoam plate. Most annoying was the very pliable plastic fork - it was impossible to pierce the veggies.  I got the small chicken with cashews and it tasted fine, but later my mouth felt really puckered from the salt.   The food was very reasonably priced, even the bottled water was reasonable, and the service was very quick.",

It's a non suspecting little Chinese (mainly takeout) place on Brownsville road, and I think they do a great job! The delivery is always efficient and the food is always good and hot and tasty! The prices are very reasonable and they have a great selection of different Chinese items you can try! It's not the best Chinese I've ever had in my whole life, but in may be the best simple takeout cheap Chinese I've had. They're also always nice and the delivery drivers are friendly as well.

I personally have not ventured far past their General Tso's chicken.. the sauce is out of this world good! It's my favorite General Tso's around! They are very generous with their portion sizes as well!  I also love their veggie entree too! TONS of veggies and the sauce is awesome! They always provide you with tons of sauce, so asking for extra is not necessary!  Their lo main noodles are awesome too! One container and I have dinner, lunch and another dinner.. they PACK the container to capacity!  Wang's Kitchen is awesome- although they are not a place that I would recommend eating in at. For me, I have only ordered take out. They do have a space available for eating in, but it's not very large and it's loud in there as well. Take out is the way to go!  Overall, AWESOME food and consistently good service too!",

As a person who comes from Brooklyn, New York which has a huge Chinese population (and many Chinese and Vietnamese restaurants along Avenue U and the East Teens, I've become accustomed to a non-sweet Chinese cuisine.  Pittsburgh, however, especially as you get further away from the Chinese restaurants of Squirrel Hill which cater to many Chinese mainland CMU students, seems to love \"sweet and preferably sweeter\".  Sure enough, the Szechuan chicken was far, far sweeter than I prefer.  I also got hot and sour soup (my favorite) which had a lot of good stuff in it but was, unfortunately, pretty much tasteless.  I won't be back.  I will, however, return to another Chinese place nearby on Brownsville Road in Carrick.  Number One Kitchen was it?  I rather liked that lunch special.  But was it good by accident or is it consistently good?  I hope it's the latter.",
