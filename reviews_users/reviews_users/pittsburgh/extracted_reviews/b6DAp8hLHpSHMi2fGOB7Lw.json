    "text": "I ended up getting a build-your-own burger tonight. Pretzel bun, half beef/half bacon, no sauce, and some veggies. Fries instead of chips.  The burger was okay; a little salty which I liked (due to the bacon) but it could have still been more well done (I asked for well-done and it was medium at best). It had a fryer grease overtone to the whole thing.  Fries were okay; to me, anything is better than home-fried potato chips. Too bad they were cold.  We also got the big cookie dessert. Our waitress, Megan, told us the cookie was 8\" in diameter, it was more like 4 or 5. It was really, really good, though. Easily two servings, but definitely not three. They don't have sweet tea or raspberry tea, either.  I didn't care for the atmosphere; very loud and very cold. It was 30 degrees outside and not much warmer indoors, even with every seat filled and space heaters cranking. The wait area is also stuffy, cramped, and uninviting.  Seats were EXTREMELY uncomfortable. They were basically lawn chairs.  Overall, I'd give Burgatory three stars for food, but between being stabbed on price, terrible waiting area, dirty floors, uncomfortable chairs, and the very cold dining room, I think two is justified. I probably would have awarded only one star had I not sprung for dessert.  Review #174.",

Eating out is usually not an option for her but we thought we'd give her a treat and let her eat some of the fries. Forgot to take the weighing scale!! The staff and manager were exceptionally helpful, and super sweet in not only weighing the fries, confirming the exact weight twice, but also in making those few fries look pretty as they came stacked in a cool grid on a plate to our table- brought personally by the manager. Thanks, Jef, Ryan, Katie, Sara and Courtney - for not just adding some normalcy to our daughter's evening, but a dash of 'special' too. Your warmth was truly appreciated and moving.

And to my delight they opened last weekend. It was on! We went early Saturday and there was no wait. We were greeted by a friendly hostess who had us seated immediately. The dining area is nice and clean. It didn't seemed too cramped either even we were seated on a bench seat next to another table and two more beyond that. We were greeted quickly by our friendly and knowledgeable waiter. He was spot on (I believe his name was Jeremy). We ordered. I had the Farmer Brown burger that comes on a fresh bun with an egg (runny and wonderful), Canadian bacon, lettuce, and cheese. The burger was fresh and juicy and cooked absolutely perfectly. The hubby got the build your own which was basically the Farmer Brown without the cheese and instead of Canadian bacon he got the smoked applewood bacon. The fries were crisp and light. It was amazing! And let's not forget the shakes. I chose the salted caramel which is always a crowd pleaser. The hubby got the chocolate shake which was awesome too. And to go a burger, plain for Hugo which  he thoroughly enjoyed. Terrific! Welcome to the North Hills Burgatory! We will be back for sure. And even though it is new, didn't seem to be any kinks here. Loved it!",

    "text": "This is my go to place for lunch.   Excellent burgers. The meat, bun, and toppings are all good. Unlike some other burger joints, you want to go a bit light on the toppings so you can taste how good the beef is.   Take the time to create your own burger. The wait staff will help you navigate which rub you want if you are unsure what each one you will like best.  For sides I can recommend either the organic greens which is a tasty salad or the fries which are equally tasty.  The milkshakes are excellent, though the whipped cream tastes a bit like marshmallows which some people like and some don't.   They are very allergen friendly.  The only thing I can say bad about them is their kid's meals. My kids don't like any of them, but they do like splitting a full size burger that they enjoy creating together.",

I finally walked up to someone who looked like a manager and asked him if I could order some take out. Obviously annoyed he said 'yeah, I can do that.' Side note - I don't discriminate against those that have a more artsy appearance with dreads and face piercings, BUT, there is a difference between being different and looking unkempt and dirty. VERY UNAPPETIZING. My husband likes their burgers so this food was for him not me. But now I understand why he requested I go and get it while he stayed home. Complete jerks.",

Service is very quick and polite though. They offer a gluten free bun and are available to answer questions on the menu. I would say that I was able to order from about 50% of the menu (which I see as good odds).

I usually get my burger pink but since my pregnancy, I had to get no pink and the burger was still perfect and juicy!  Their build your own has a lot of choices.  Even the kids menu sounds delish to me! If you don't eat burgers, they do have a chicken sandwich and other sandwiches and salads.    Burgers will come with sweet potato and russet potato chips.  I've never had a problem with the chips, but there are other side options for an extra $1.50.  I would get the salad or sea salt fries.  The deviled egg potato salad was no bueno. It was bland. The wait can be long sometimes, but it's worth it to me when I'm craving their food.",

Our waitress Mandi was very warm and helpful as we made our way through the menu, more specifically the custom creation menu. We settled on 2 very different burgers for the two of us. Mine was a mix of farmhouse cheddar, chimichurri aioli, grilled onions, tomatoes and romaine while my husband went with the Fiddy Fiddy (half beef half bacon patty) with sharp provolone, chili lime ranch, red onion, pickle, lettuce, tomatoes and lettuce.  The burgers come with chips( regular and sweet potato). We wanted to try a shake but I'm glad we passed this time, the burgers were plenty to fill us up. May have to drop in just to try some shakes one afternoon. Military discount was given to my husband. Parking was fine the day we went but I can see it being kind of crazy if you were there during the week.",

I have been to Burgatory before in Robinson and remember waiting a very long time for a table.   My dad was in the mood for a beer and I do have to say he waited on that to arrive for quite sometime. My mom build her own burger and I ended up building my own wild crab burger. I have to say I did enjoy mine very much. I ordered it bunless, smoked gouda and with Sriracha Remoulade. I can't say that our server was very attentive though because she had another server bring our meals and I wasn't given silverware. So I had to wait until she came around again to ask. Since I went bunless I couldn't eat it with my hands, things would have gotten messy! The food was good, the service could have been better.",

The vibe is energetic, the menu is fun and the staff is friendly. I feel these are general statements because each location I've been to share those qualities. This location is no different. If this is your first time, I believe the \"Meat Your Maker\" is the best first burger to try because it has high quality wagyu beef, great toppings and is a strong introduction to the restaurant. You should also order a shake and if you like vodka, I don't think you can go wrong with the Choco Taco. Lastly, just a little tip, save some $ by substituting the chips for fries. It's a little extra but it saves you from having to buy them as an appetizer.",

If you are going to call something herb fries you need to actually put herbs on them, not the 5 little flakes that were on mine. I added salt as well, but I like salty fries.

I am vegan and my wife is pescatarian so we were anxious to try their vegan options. Upon ordering our server, Brie, was excellent and offered suggestions based on our vegan preferences. She was an excellent server and took the time to make sure we were only served vegan food. I had the Vegan Veggie Burger with the local grains bun and an amazing whole grain mustard. It was EXCELLENT! My wife had the Impossible Burger and loved it (see pictures). To take with us she ordered a vegan shake. When it came out, she was disappointed as it had whipped cream and chocolate syrup on it, but again, must to our pleasant surprise, it was all vegan! Many restaurants will have a vegan burger and throw cow cheese on it; likewise, many restaurants will offer a vegan shake only to put dairy whipped topping on it. Burgatory is the exception and should be the rule others follow in this regard. They take their vegan menu seriously and it is greatly appreciated!",

    "text": "We came here a few weeks ago on a Friday night, and had a decent experience. Honestly, I have had much better experiences at the Robinson Burgatory, which was our go-to location until we moved closer to this one.  When we arrived and put our name in, we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait. The hostess rolled her eyes at us and seemed to have an attitude. While we were waiting, we walked around McCandless Crossing a bit. When we still did not receive a text that our table was ready after about 40 minutes, we returned and waited for 10 more minutes. Then, we inquired about how much longer it might be. It turns out there was a table ready, but none of the staff at the hostess stand were paying attention to prepare it and seat us. Our server was friendly and helpful. We ordered Cheese Fries for an appetizer, and we each got different burgers with a side of chips for our entree. I ordered the milkshake special of the week, which was Puppy Chow. It had chocolate ice cream, peanut butter swirl, and peanut butter covered Chex pieces in it. The food was amazing! It was pretty consistent with the food at the Robinson location. My biggest complaint in addition to the hosting staff is the state of the restrooms. Only one stall had toilet paper in it when we got there. Tons of people were waiting in line because it was a busy Friday night. Before we left, I used the restroom again, and still only one stall with paper. An employee was in there and told us waiting in line that she's \"sorry that they're too busy to restock the paper.\" A lot of the staff members here could benefit from more training in customer service and the restaurant industry.  We will come back again to give this Burgatory a try, as we live very close to this location and maybe they were having an off night since it was so busy. But if we have an experience like this again we will definitely be going to the Robinson location in the future instead.",

    "text": "This is a great casual burger & beer place  with friendly service.   Burgatory is a sit-down place with table service (which surprised me a bit).  They offer a bunch of suggested \"gourmet\" burgers (some of which were kinda odd), plus you can basically build your own.  With a ton of options at every turn (protein, bun, cheese, toppings), you can get pretty much whatever you want.  You can order the burger either rare, medium rare, or well done.  The medium-rare burgers were great, although one of the burgers that we ordered medium rate came out more like well-done, which was on the dry side.  One other minor complaint - you have the option of adding one of a number of \"rubs\" to the burgers, but the options aren't really explained in any way.  I ignored the rubs and the burger came out fine.  Burgers are served, by default, with chips, which is a little bit of a bummer.  Its only$1.50 to upgrade to some very tasty rosemary and sea salt fries.  So . . . do that.  they also offer a ton of drinks, including alcoholic milkshakes.  They aren't my thing, but whatever, there are tons of drink options.  The sangria is a nice, if sweet choice, served with this kind-of-odd graham cracker and honey thing around the rim.  Again, the service was great, the food came out fast, and prices aren't terrible for a high-end fast-casual option. If you want a fairly fast bite to eat before a movie, you could do a lot worse!",

    "text": "Our past two visits at this location have not gone well. Last time my husband's burger was nearly raw, and it was so dark in the restaurant that we couldn't see our food, so he didn't realize it until he was eating what tasted like raw meat. They remade it and brought us a huge basket of fries, and only charged us half price for his burger, so we left feeling a little better about it. Until we made another visit.  On this visit, we went on a Tuesday at 7-ish. We were seated right away, and then weren't greeted by a server until almost ten minutes had passed. Then a server came by and said that our actual server was really busy, and that he was going to get us drinks while we waited. So we ordered drinks, and waited. And waited. And waited. Drank our drinks and waited a bit longer. Then our server arrived and said she just finished training, and now she was overwhelmed by being on duty.   We had our orders all ready to go, but then discovered that there's no way to get kid's side orders of chips or fries without the spicy seasoning. :/ Despite having had them that way on our previous visit. Whatever. So we got no side at all, but still paid for the whole meal. The food took even longer to arrive, and any time we needed something (more mayo, drinks, etc.), it was a very long wait. So disappointing. We were there for 90 minutes total, just to get a burger and a grilled cheese, and then a milkshake to go. This isn't a good trend in their service overall. Let's hope it's short lived.",

    "text": "We waited weeks and drove nearly 500 miles to try the Impossible Burger at the Burgatory. It was worth every bite.   During a Thanksgiving trip to Pittsburgh we stopped off at Burgatory to try this new meatless burger created by Silicon Valley startup Impossible Foods. I read about the Impossible Burger in the Wall Street Journal and read an article about it in Wired magazine.   Let me say this is not at all like a veggie burger. The consistency and taste is as close to meat as I've ever seen. The flavor was outstanding.   The Burgatory allows you to customize your burger. I had mine on a brioche bun with grilled onions, a grilled pineapple and honey habanero sauce. My wife and two daughters also had their own customized Impossible Burgers. There was a lot of munching and not a lot of talking during dinner. I can't speak highly enough of how fantastic these burgers are.   The ambience in Burgatory was great. My daughters ordered $6.50 milk shakes.  I felt a little like Vince Vega at Jack Rabbit Slims in Pulp Fiction. They were pretty darn good shakes.   Ironically there is another burger joint right across the street at the Burgatory location we visited. The restaurant was full and there was a long line of people waiting to get into the Burgatory but the other place was half empty. A pretty good indication of which place you want to go to.",

My only wish is that next to the rubs and sauces was a description, as we had to ask the waitress several questions about what was in things.

Had to take a road trip 2 hours away and used Yelp to find out what was in the same area as the Trader Joes that we decided to stop at.     Glad we decided to give this place a try. I had a Buffaloed bison burger and loved every bite. This is a nice little burger place in the McCandless crossing shopping plaza that's filled with a lot of options for dining. The menu is filled with a lot of different burger options and Bison was my main reason for going.    The burger was seasoned perfectly and the fries were crispy and deliciously seasoned. If I decide to travel through this area again I will definitely stop back.",

I begged my sis to convince the in laws to choose Burgatory. Me and the rest of the family go to this location we are greeted by the hostess who was friendly attentive & ready to seat us. Our server was also friendly & attentive. We really didn't have to see the menu once she handed us a customization checklist on how we wanted our burger from spices how we wanted it cooked toppings condiments etc. & there was a unique selection on the list of everything I mentioned that your average restaurants that serves burgers don't. I was satisfied on the degree of how my burger was cooked loved my piping hot fries. After this wonderful experience of quality service food cleanliness of the restaurant. I Can't wait to go back next time I visit Pittsburgh.

My friend ordered as she always does an impossible burger with \"NO PINK\" clearly indicates on the order slip. She got it pink all through to the outside with her side of fries numbering about 15. My delicious elk burger that I ordered was more pink than usual but I don't mind that. Perhaps the grill chef likes rare. My friends cheese wasn't even melted (see photo). We sent back of course. They were mildly apologetic. I ordered a cocktail and had to catch waitress about 15 minutes later. She was mildly apologetic also.  I don't know if this lapse was because it's a Saturday afternoon as opposed to evening, but not the usual stellar food and service. Today the north shore burgatory has them beaten soundl Came back and explained to the server how to cook a well done impossible burger... she was telling us that they had little control over this but the burger came out great!

However, the only made by Elk meat was too spicy but it was not mentioned in the menu. Guys! When you serve a food that is exceptionally hot, please mention it in the menu. My wife could not have her meal not only because it was too spicy but also because it was pink in the middle while she had asked the waiter to make sure that it was not so! The service was good.

Our waitress was so sweet and helpful and checked in on us multiple times throughout our meal. She never made us feel like a nuisance and even split our check 3 ways for us so it was easier for us to pay. They have a great kids menu and little games for the kids to draw on in the menu.   They have some unique burgers and you can also create your own if you are feeling particular about toppings. We tried the bison and the elk burgers, medium, and they were both pretty good. The elk burger was a little too spicy for my taste, but the bison was pretty juicy and had a very unique flavor. Could definitely tell that it wasn't beef. The burgers come with chips and we upgraded to fries for an extra $1.50, but honestly, I preferred the chips! It is a mixture of potato and sweet potato chips- yum.   You HAVE to get a shake when you visit! They are decadent, sweet, and so worth it. I got the nutella crunch one and it had the perfect texture with a bunch of candy mixed in too. It's definitely not an everyday thing but makes a great special treat.  It is not cheap (our burgers were $14.50 each, plus $1.50 for fries and $6.50 for the shake) but it is definitely worth it once in awhile for a delicious meal if you want to go somewhere with your kids. Easy parking too.",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped at Burgatory on a random Thursday evening just to get out of the house. I was excited to try it as I have heard great things, especially about their milkshakes. Parking near the restaurant can be challenging but we were willing to walk from Trader Joes' nearby.   When we arrived, the restaurant was not very busy and we were seated quickly. Our waitress was very nice and asked if we have been there before - since I have not been, she went over the menu and then the option to create your own burger. I was instantly drawn to creating my own as their specialty burgers did not appeal to me. I had an all beef burger with an all grains bun (very tasty), BBQ rub, bourbon BBQ sauce, bacon jam, grilled pineapple, lettuce, and red onion. The presentation of the food was good, however my burger was not even close to being the size of the bun nor was it very thick. I ordered a side of BBQ sauce (I like it saucy) which we were charged extra for. My husband added a side of ranch to dip his chips in and again, we were charged extra. Speaking of chips, good crunch however unevenly seasoned.   We had to end our meal with a milkshake. We ordered the Fluffer Nutter and it was absolutely delicious! Make sure you share when you order a milkshake as they give you the extra amount that does not fit in the cup, so you are getting two for the price of one.   I would return here any day for just a milkshake. My burger experience was sub par, and the extra charges seemed a little excessive, especially when you are already paying a good amount of money for the burger itself.   See you again for a milkshake, maybe the boozy version next time!",

I've always preferred big, thick burgers over the thin and smashed types, so burgatory is great. Tried a custom elk burger, with cheddar and American. It was delicious and I couldn't even finish it. I tried though. Just wish there was a Burgatory closer to my area. I'll be back next time I'm in town.",

With a great selection of meat; custom blend, wagyu, elk and bison they have a great base to build off of.  Choose your bun, crust, toppings and bread and you should be in burger heaven.  Not the case. We all did the custom blend patty which is 1/3 lb and contains rib and pulled pork.  Didn't taste any of the other meats besides the beef and even that was disappointingly bland.  One patty of the three was over done.  Even with potentially potent cheeses, rubs and sauces available to top the burgers, nothing jumped out at us as anything above ordinary.  As for the sides:  the fries at 5 guys are better, the beans are heavily seasoned with Cinnamon and the slaw was just fair.  There is a ton of potential here with the format they are using but they have not created anything that stands on its own yet.  If they can get that right, the service and ambience are fantastic, this place will be a real winner.",

The draw I suppose is their pad of paper with tons of choices to create your own burger by picking type of meat, rub, bun, cheese, sauce & toppings. I had a beef burger with mushroom rub, potato bun, Gouda, aioli, spinach, tomato, onion & pickles- with fries. It was cooked medium as ordered. The burger was soft, and tasted good, but it wasn't juicy. It was good, but not great. I had a Bacon Mary, which came with lemon, lime, olives & candied bacon, that was tasty. I had a Dirt shake here once that was delicious. No room for dessert today. Bartenders have always been friendly & attentive. So, it's a good place to go if you wanna create an exotic burger to your own specifications, but I've had better burgers at other places.",

    "text": "Wow! Another Burgatory review!!!  This is the closest location to me now and while I have expanded my horizons...Burgatory still gets me in the feels.  Unlike some of the other locations, I hardly ever have a wait here and if I do, it isn't long. If you do have to wait, may I suggest going across the street and checking out Deer Creek Winery. Great way to pass the time!  All the familiar tropes are here for building your burger. I still love the Diablo rub, onion straws and horseradish cheddar. And while those typically find their way onto my burger I'm always switching it up. Point in case, on my last visit I set out to try the Impossible Burger. The supposed non-meat burger that still seems like meat all the way down to having a pink juicy center.  What?  Challenge accepted. My Impossible Burger was topped with White American Cheese, Shredded Iceberg, Tomato, Onion Straws, Dill Pickles & Roasted Garlic Mayo on a Potato Bun (the waiter suggested the Potato Bun...good suggestion!). My advice is don't overload it because then you miss out on flavors. 4-5 toppings aside from your cheese and rub is probably good.  The Chips that come free with the burger are excellent so i stuck with them rather than grabbing fries this time! I also passed on the Jalapeno Cornbread on this visit but it is a must try! Just make sure they warm the butter for you.    So how was the Impossible Burger?  Well, glad you asked! It was really good!  Did it taste like meat? Not really, but it had it own unique flavor that I really liked. I would not say it tasted like a typical veggie burger at all.  Definitely unique and the toppings all complimented the burger itself. Would I get it again? Maybe...  The Impossible Burger is roughly the price of the Wagyu which I love and more expensive than their Regular Beef or Bison burger. So unless you are specifically wanting this burger or are going a vegetarian diet, I find it hard to justify the cost.  But don't get me wrong, it is very good!  I've never had a bad experience here. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The food has always been consistent and I'm sure you will find something to like here.",

Three out of four of us were happy with the meal. One burger ordered pink arrived well-done. Also, fire roasted tomatoes were just tomatoes warmed not really roasted. Chips were crisp, but lacked some seasoning and the potato salad was underwhelming. I will ordered the side salad in the future.

    "text": "I've been here three times now and my experience has gotten worse each time. I had such high expectations for Burgatory and the new location that just opened in Mccandless crossing meant you can't go wrong correct? Dead wrong. I'll review my most recent experience.   We arrived about 4:45 on Friday night, before the dinner crowd arrived and were seated. I was feeling some nachos so we ordered the six napkin nachos. They came with chili, cheese, jalapenos, corn and a bunch of sour cream. These things were downright disgusting. The cheese had no taste, the chips were stale, and the jalapenos didn't taste anything like jalapenos. They put a ton of corn on them with very little chili. I told the waitress I didn't like them. She took them off the table. My sister ordered the mortys steakhouse burger and said it was good. I got the Buffaloed Bison. The waitress recommended that be cooked with a little pink (I usually get well done burgers). The fries had a Cajun taste to it, but all I could taste was fryer grease. The burger was just ok. Wasn't crazy about it. I went home and felt slouchy and then sat in front of my toilet waiting to throw up for an hour. I had just a bad taste and feeling inside me which was perhaps from the pink in my burger. My bill came to $22 for just the burger and a vanilla milkshake. Luckily the waitress removed the nachos from the bill, but this girl had an attitude pretty much from the moment we sat down.   Final conclusion of this place is that I am not impressed and will not be returning to any burgatory location. I think they hired prissy girls off the street who have nothing but sour puss faces and horrible attitudes. The milkshakes are way too strong and they put way too many pretzels, marshmallows, etc. in the shakes and the burger selection is very poor. If you are looking for a good burger place go to BRGR or Red Robin in cranberry. Those places are much better. Better food, better selections, better milkshakes, better dining, and better customer service. Very disappointed in Burgatory!",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that most eateries don't rub me the wrong way like this.  I'm fairly pleased, if not happy, with the myriad of establishments that I try.  However, I must be the only person in the world who isn't a gushing fanboy for this completely overrated-ripoff of a burger joint, even though cleverly-named.  My wallet and stomach thought I was all the way down in Hell.    I'd been to the Waterworks location a few times, if that, and was disappointed at what you got for the price.  Sure, the quality is there, but not the size.  Yes, portion isn't everything, but for their prices, it should be a big factor.  Sure, \"big\" was a pun, why not.  Anyway,  I've been to numerous places that have had as good, if not better, of burger quality and size for the money.  Nox Grille, in Blawnox, just overall wipes the floor with Burgatory.  Beer Nutz kicked their butts, too.  Beer Nutz was supposedly owned by Burgatory, but now are closed.  Beer Nutz had great portions, quality, and prices.  Coincidence?  Ya think you pay a ton for the flashy atmosphere at Trendytory?  \"Oh, Burgatory is soooooo awesome...all my friends go there!\"  Ooooh, tell me more!  I didn't care to visit the obnoxiously-loud establishment again, on my own at least.  A few of my friends invited me out the other night, and I hadn't seen one in forever, so I figured \"Why not, my buds are out.\"  I was trying to imagine that this time would be better, or just different, but nope, it was worse (worst ever, actually).  I saw all of the burger prices, and thought, for the bun being considerably bigger than the burger (last two times and looking around at other plates), I thought \"Ummm, no.\"  I got one of their salads...yes, at a gourmet burger place, because at least the salad prices seemed comparable to other places that give you monster ones, so I was...hopeful?  Wrong again.  The salad wasn't small, but very average-sized for an entree.  Bravo kicks their butt in this area.  (Seeing a pattern here yet?)  The beer prices were also stupid, as the cheapest one was $6.  I can name a ton of other places that have better prices across the board.  Burgatory's selection was paltry, too, at best.  Somehow, no one else, including my friends, seem to care about spending a tank of gas and then some, on dinner for themselves when it's nothing worth it.  Hey, you can do more with gas anyway, including lighting your ripoff dinner on fire...at least that'd be enjoyable.        So, you can imagine how overpriced my dinner was (naw really?).  Again, I don't get the hype here.  Not only was the wait time almost TWO HOURS (this is supposedly normal on a busy night, but who gives a s**t, strike one).  Then this place just kept striking out like a batter with chicken wings for arms.  Crap, I should've eaten wings.  My friends and I were there for a while hanging out, and that was of course a good experience, unlike the restaurant for me (I held in the angst).  Then...wait for it...my check, after tip (I still tip well for decent service) came to around $30.  $30 for a salad and two beers.  Burgatory SUCKS.",

    "text": "The food there is sooo big! Like, woah. Big. The staff there is very friendly, and they prepared the food very quickly. It was exquisite. I made my own burger, and they cleverly disguise costs in the paper, which is cool if you look hard enough. It is also very well themed. Lastly, it was very location specific because it had references to North Park, the Trader Joes nearby, and the overpriced movie theater candy, which I found very hilarious! I will definitely be coming back to Burgatory! Oh, and the shakes are perfect!",

My only complaint is that I wish they would keep cold food cold until you pick up your order (the kids meals come with carrot sticks and they're always warm).  Also, a little less salt on the fries.   But seriously if you haven't tried this place out you're missing out",

They clearly do not care about the customers and have people sitting behind you, next to you and basically on top of you if they sit you next to the bar area. I asked to be moved to open tables due in part to allergies and other part to actually be able to have a private conversation but was told no and that we would have to go back to the wait list as this was our assigned table! The food is really good and our sever was excellent but if you want to be comfortable and have conversation with your company stay away as the seating stinks!",

It was the night before Thanksgiving, so it was a little bit of a wait, but it was so worth it. I was joined by my sister and our daughters and couldn't be happier with the service and the food. Emily was our server and she explained everything so thoroughly. She put the kids food in first and got it out quickly, and our food came out soon after. She even talked us into a milkshake which changed my world. I highly recommend trying Burgatory if you haven't already, and I will definitely be back!",
