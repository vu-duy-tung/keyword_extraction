Since I am usually a Nicky's fan for Thai food in the city, I was skeptical. I had the basic chicken Pad Thai with a 5 on the spice scale. It was VERY good and they gave us SO much food it took two days for us to eat it! While it is a bit pricy for some items on the menu, I was impressed with how good the pad thai was, so for me it was worth the $20+ dollars we spent for 2 take out entrees. The 5 was spicy for me, and just on the verge of being a little too spicy, but it was really delicious and not an overwhelming heat at all. Will definitely be visiting again and Im so glad its right down the street!",

So far we've tried the Pad Thai (with chicken), the Pumpkin Curry (with grilled chicken), and the Pad Kraw Paw.   Once again, the ingredients were fresh and the flavors were distinct and pleasing.  Tried one of their homemade chocolate french pastrries and it went down well.     VERY reasonably priced.   BYOB is an additional savings.  Has gotten popular quickly.  I suggest you make reservations.",

    "text": "Yes! Yes! Yes! A real-life non-bar, non-diner, non-fast food restaurant in Glenshaw. If only this were a more regular occurrence in our little piece of suburbia. Le Thai Cafe has been open less than a month. It was the former Cafe Venice. The new owners completely transformed the space from tacky italian to rustic chic! The prices are fair with stir fried noodle dishes starting at $9 with no protein and $13 if you'd like chicken, tofu, beef or shrimp. They also have a selection of Thai salads, fried rice, noodle soups, as well as appetizers.   We ordered each of the 4 appetizers on the menu and enjoyed them all. The appetizers are Crispy Spring Rolls, Fresh Rolls, Chicken Satay, and Moo Yang (Thai bbq pork skewers). Portions were reasonable and each app cost $5-$7.  Another perk of this place. Thai Iced Tea and Thai Iced Coffee! These are go-to beverages when we visit our other thai-favorite Pusadee's, so we were excited to see them on the menu here as well. Better yet, they were only $2 a glass! The restaurant is also BYOB for those who'd like to have some wine.  For dinner, I ordered the Pad See Ew with chicken, a stir fried noodle dish with wide noodles, eggs, broccoli and carrots. The portion was large enough that I took about half of it home for lunch the next day. It was full of flavor and the vegetables weren't overdone and still had great crunch. I found that getting the spice at a #3 was just enough for me.   There were 7 of us dining that night and our bill was only $160, which is a super reasonable, especially since that includes multiple appetizers and a few thai iced teas and coffees.   The only complaint, which isn't really a complaint, was that since they are newly opened, they are still trying to figure out the system that works best for them. Service was a little slow, but the owner of the restaurant recognized this and apologized twice throughout our dinner, telling us that it will get better as they get their bearings.   We can't wait to come back again and hope to become regulars here. Three cheers to Le Thai Cafe!",

    "text": "What a cool, quirky little place with a very friendly hostess/waitress!  It is nothing special to look at outside, but inside, there are many interesting and attractive pieces of art/junque everywhere, bright colors, plants, and huge windows.  The entire restaurant is very clean.  There is ample, free parking to the side and back of Le Thai Cafe.  BTW, while the location may initially seem as if it is in the middle of nowhere, it is fairly close to Ross Park Mall and McCandless Crossing. We came for lunch and were not disappointed.  We are Pad Thai junkies, so, of course, that was what we ordered - he had the Beef Pad Thai and I ordered the Shrimp (both were $2 upcharges).  Despite the menu stating that lunch came with an egg roll, a small salad arrived at our table, composed of greens (no iceberg lettuce - YEA!), shredded carrot, red onion and a tasty dressing.  Our Pad Thai dishes were delivered hot and attractively plated.  The sauce on the rice noodles was a pinkish color and pleasant tasting, although a little sweeter than we are accustomed.  Just a note: you might want to dial back your typical spice level.  We always request a 7 for me and he likes a 5; we both thought that our meals were very, very spicy - although not too spicy to still be enjoyable.  We will go with #5 and #3 levels on our next visit - which will be soon!",

I was kind of worried when my friend suggested we try a thai place in Shaler area. There are so many better and closer reataurants (or so I thought). When I walked in, I was really impressed with the decor. I was not planning on eating very much, I was in the sun a lot earlier in the day, but I got really good vibes in there. It was calming, with huge windows and borderline quirky decor. Things like elephant statues, giant paintings of every fruit imaginable and an enormous Krishna covered the walls. There were also many, many plants. I liked it! I felt comfortable. I looked at the menu, and they had all my usual favorites. I love noodles, so I ordered the See Yew noodles with tofu. I was impressed. I am spoiled by Noodlehead, but this place was truly comparable. The portions were large and the prices were not terrible. I especially loved the pieces of egg in my dish, they were extra flavorful for some reason. Mus have really soaked up the brown sauce! The only thing I didn't completely love in the dish were the weird little pieces of carrot. I would return if I was ever in the area again.",

I was staying with my youngest siblings for a week while my mother was out of town, and one day I ordered us all some takeout from Le Thai Cafe  so they could get a taste of Thai food.  We chose some Thai fried rice as well as Pad Thai, both with chicken. I ordered over the phone and had everything picked up within ten minutes. The interior was clean and cute, and the service was friendly. I would definitely come back and eat-in if I was ever in the neighborhood for an extended period of time again. The fried rice had a higher spice level than expected, but it was delicious nonetheless. The Pad Thai was incredible honestly! The sauce had a savory undertone that was addicting...I haven't tasted any other version of the dish quite like it in a while. Usually Pad Thai is way too sweet. Both portions were generous and lasted for at least two meals. I will get takeout again from here at any rate, even if I'm just stopping by for a quick visit to my family.",

The noodles were mushy and overcooked, the pork was tough and dry, it was devoid of vegetables, and the flavor was so lackluster that I had to doctor it up with Sriracha.   We ordered spring rolls, too. Incredibly bland. Don't bother.   This is likely the most expensive Thai food I've had in Pittsburgh. We spent $30 on two entrees and spring rolls. Portions were just too small to justify the prices.",

First they brought hot spring rolls, then a complimentary order of dumplings as well as Thai iced tea.  We would've been happy with just hot spring rolls but they truly were apologetic and more than redeemed themselves for serving spring rolls that had cool pockets inside.

We ordered our meals but our server did not write down anything. I ordered chicken and shrimp pad thai with a spice level of 1 and my boyfriend ordered a broccoli and shrimp thing with a spice level of 7. (I was planning to order soup but it was so damn warm in the restaurant that soup seemed like a ridiculous idea.) When the food arrived, my boyfriend's order was completely wrong. He was given chicken with ZERO spice. I mean, it was bland. Because the server hadn't written down our orders, she obviously couldn't reference anything when my boyfriend told her that his order was wrong. The chicken was weirdly flattened and VERY dry, to the point of being inedible. The handful of shrimp on my pad thai was rubbery and overly fishy tasting. My pad thai was weird and sticky. No cilantro. No lime. The server did not charge us for my boyfriend's meal, which we appreciated. Even though this place is literally five minutes from my house, we will not be going back.",

Wicked cold out and nothing in the house to eat... whats this, Yelp? Order for delivery - le Thai cafe?? For sure!! Delicious broths, curries and I am addicted to the steamed dumplings which are sui mai dim sum style but with a sweet dipping sauce - delectable. Thank you le Thai Cafe for being there and for being quite yummy.",

In fact, everything i've ever gotten from there has been delicious. So why not 5 stars?   Well, the service leave a bit to be desired. In the past I've had to get my own silverware, to go boxes and sauces. No one seems able to get spice levels correct and sometimes, once in a great while, I will be brought the complete wrong dish. What I'm brought is still, without fail, delicious, but still, come on.   I highly recommend this place, but only if you're patient and willing to go along for the ride.",

Also a small pool with gold fish and trickling water. Jules was our waiter who did a nice service and was very informative. Food is very good Thai food. I ordered my very hot and it was very hot. The steamed dumplings were excellent as well as my cashew nut. My wife had le Thai noodles chef special which was also very good. Large servings. Tom yum soup very authentic and good. The inside is a very pretty and stylish setting. Casual elegant with different tables and seating areas. Really impressed with this restaurants food and decor. Will return and is recommended.",

Sure, you don't get the amazing experience of walking out onto Mount Royal Blvd and almost getting a limb removed by a dozen crazy motorbikes coming at you like a swarm of angry bees, but you certainly get a wonderful, authentic cultural experience while you are dining in the restaurant...and you most definitely will not get diarrhea, which I can't say for the homeland.   I highly recommend the green curry.  I've asked for green curry at 3 different places while in Thailand and have not yet found a single one better than Le Thai Cafe.   Thailand is a beautiful country that you should visit if you want to hang out with elephants, go on a jungle hike, or buy a fake Rolex, but if all you want is an amazing Thai dinner...I say go to Pittsburgh.  PS: I haven't seen a single Crab Rangoon on any menu over here but who gives a damn, they're delicious.  Add it to the order.",

Then tried the Penang curry with chicken and the pad Thai. The curry and rice were very tasty and balanced with the right heat at a level of 6. The pad Thai was even better with the perfect noodle and chicken ratio. Would definitely eat both dishes again. The standout of the meal was the home made coconut ice cream . It blew us away. I would make the trip just to get that again. Fried bananas were just bananas in the spring roll wrapper and fried. Not my favorite choice as a desert but it was ok.",

I frequently find myself wishing for the Pad See Ew, which was amazing. I'm looking forward to trying everything on the menu, but the memory of the Pad See Ew will probably drive me to order it every time. It's that good.

We moved to the area and decided to stop in on a saturday evening for dinner, because it was BYOB. We should have ran when everyone seemed surprised someone was there to eat. We got seated by a waitress in unprofessional clothing, at a wobbly table, near the only other customers in the restaurant. It has the feel of a restaurant that someone put in their house. Uneven levels, mismatched tables, etc. I was willing to wait it out and see what they had to offer. Opening the sticky menu, my husband and I ordered what was safe. It came drenched in some sort of bottled sauce, with vegetables including crinkle-cut carrots. Long story short, we opted not to take any leftovers home, and were severely disappointed. If you want good thai food, I would strongly suggest visiting thai cuisine in bloomfield. They have better service, and better Thai food. I am not of Asian descent, but I do have tastebuds...",

The place seemed small at first until we were led into the main dining rooms. The place was clean, open, decorated great, and ambiance was peaceful and chill (the music was relaxing and positive). The waitress was very kind and prompt. She recommended some items from the menu; the lunch specials had some great deals!   I got the Tom Yum Noodle Soup with tofu and my wife got Steamed Dumplings for our appetizers. We also got complimentary Spring Rolls with the lunch specials! For the main dish, I got Basil Chicken, which was recommended by the waitress and Yelp reviewers, and my wife got Pad Thai with vegetables and tofu.   The soup was so fresh, tasty, and flavorful. Not too salty and just the right amount of heat. The dumplings tasted homemade (not pre-frozen) and were delectable and flavorful. The Spring Rolls with the sauce were good as well. However, the rolls and dumplings could have been a little larger - the taste made up for this.   Lastly, the main courses were amazing. My Basil Chicken used such fresh ingredients and was cooked perfectly. The flavors could all be tasted and were perfectly combined; the lunch portion size was decent too. My wife's Pad Thai was cooked perfectly as well. The noodles weren't too greasy and the flavors were great. The only con of the Pad Thai was there wasn't really any vegetables in it, only small slivers or carrots and green onions.  All in all, our experience was very enjoyable and the food was bomb. We will definitely be revisiting this place, especially if our plans to buy a house 5 minutes away go through! Keep up the good work Le Thai Cafe!",

We were seated in a through way next to a broken down aquarium in very uncomfortable chairs; the table was 'sticky'.  It felt like the a/c must've been broken as the air was stuffy. Our service was below average to say the least. We were brought glasses of water and our ordered meals. Period. That's it. No, \"how is your meal?, would you like anything else?\" I ordered the chicken Pad Thai (which was oddly sweet) and my wife ordered the red curry. She loved her curry and mine was just okay. The spring rolls were fairly good, but there are definitely places around town that serve better. This place is not bad, but again. There are better Thai restaurants around town.",

It was a sunny day and not to cold and they had outside sitting so we walked in and asked to sit outside.  There was another couple outside and eventually throughout the night it got busier.  We ordered summer rolls that came with Tofu.  We were really hungry and they were a great appetizer.  I ordered the pad Se Ew with chicken.  The only problem was that it took a while for our food to come out.  The waitress told us a few times that it would be soon but it probably took 30 minutes.  They do a lot of take out here so maybe that's why they were behind because it usually doesn't take this long.  It did come out and it was really good.  I can't complain.  I ate everything.  The noodles were perfect and the chicken was good too.  I got a 6 spice level and probably could have did a 7 or 8.  This is a really good Thai place but too bad it took too long.

Anyway, I went there on a Friday evening with my family and we had a terrific Thai meal. We shared everything and everyone agreed that each dish was unique and delicious. Pork dumplings, crab Rangoon, Fresh Rolls (with tofu - first time I've had that, I'm accustomed to either shrimp or chicken) and chicken satay (served with peanut sauce and chili infused vinegar, I think) were our appetizers and cashew shrimp, mango curry beef (both came with a cute, heart-shaped though somewhat small portion of Jasmine rice) and chicken Pad Thai were our main course selections. Two of us were pretty unfamiliar with Thai cuisine but my wife and I are very familiar and eat Thai and Malaysian cooking fairly regularly, so we have a good basis for comparison. 3 entrees for 4 of us was perfect.  Service was efficient and our server, while not perfectly fluent in English, was very friendly and attentive.  We sat inside, which was very pretty and comfortable, but we debated sitting outside, which, despite being close to the street, had a garden oasis feel to it. Next time (assuming the weather cooperates) we will sit outside.   Hear me now, my Pittsburgh friends, this happy little place is a real find. Excellent quality fresh tasting real deal Thai cooking at very reasonable prices served in a clean, tastefully decorated restaurant by friendly staff. Don't miss this!",

    "text": "I'm trying to eat my way through all the Thai food in Pittsburgh and this was my second stop. I ordered a pick up and just a note if you are ordering online make sure you indicate the spicy level you would like in the comments for the order. I ordered a 2 (which is apparently their lowest level) and my husband went with the 6. He was pleased with the taste and spice level and rate it higher than our first stop. I felt the 2 was still a little too spicy and ended up adding more coconut milk to tame the spice- next time I would request if a 1 is possible- I felt like it was strange 2 was the lowest, I've never seen that before. I did request added veggies and I don't believe I was charged for them which is always a bonus. I would just add this place might be slightly pricier than other local Thai places- just by a couple dollars. Don't forget to get a Thai iced tea- the best drink ever!",

This is a charming place tucked into the northern suburbs, and its food go toe to toe with [insert name of another popular Pittsburgh Thai restaurant here] any day.  I had samosas (at a Thai place? what??), spring rolls, pad thai, and the spicy green beans.  Funny enough, the pad thai was ordered at a fairly low spice level and the spicy green beans weren't given any extra consideration, and the pad thai was spicier!  But all was good.  The service was fine, although I've heard from a regular that even though they are always cordial, they sometimes bring you a completely different dish than you ordered, haha. Also, it's BYOB, so feel free to bring a nice bottle of Riesling like my date did.  *My statement isn't based in factual knowledge.  I just get the strong vibe from the location and layout of this place that it wasn't originally built as a restaurant, but hey, I could be wrong.",

The only downside was the music it wasn't thai music. It was some sort of rock. If I'm in the area again I would go back. But they really have to do something about the music",

I've never had sweet (almost like honey had been added) pad Thai before.  And it wasn't SWEET...but there was a sweetness too it.  No lime.  No cilantro.  I was surprised.  It was still good, but not really something I'd order again.  That said...it's like 5 minutes from my house!!    So I have to go back and try it again.  Pad Thai is just one thing.  Maybe their curry is out of this world?  Maybe sweet pad Thai is like the most authentic pad Thai there is, and all these other haters have been making theirs wrong.  I don't know.  I'm not Thai.  It was good, but not...what I expected (wanted).  They put together some fun decor on the inside, but it's pretty small.  As I looked through the other reviews I saw pictures that looked completely different than what I saw...is there a back room or something?  The outside was a little messy.  A couple was outside dining when I picked up my food.  It was pretty much the first nice day of the spring, and maybe they just haven't cleaned up the front of the place...unless green plastic \"Little Tikes\" turtle sandboxes leaning against the side of the building are some sort of Thai decor about which I'm ignorant.  Cleaning up a bit when the warmer weather is more consistent will make this a decent outdoor dinner experience.    BYOB.    I'll be back for the curry and the convenience, and I'll add a star if the next thing I order is better than the first thing.",

Then to find out it was going to be Thai...we were just super thrilled! The restaurant opened 2 weeks ago and we've already been there twice. The decor is really nice. I should say FAR better than the previous owners, and the service is OK. I'm sure once they work out the kinks, they'll be just fine. But the food is pretty darn great! We haven't disliked anything we've tried so far. Don't hesitate to try as much of the Curry dishes as possible. The green curry (or Keaw Wan) and the Pumpkin Curry were SUPER and we're looking forward to trying the Yellow Curry next. We also had the Kanom Jeen Nam Ngiao, which is a curry with pork, tomatoes and rice noodles, pickled mustard greens, bean sprouts and fresh lime, the Spring Rolls and the Pork Moo Yang appetizers, and finally, the Beef Pad Kra Prow, with green beans and peppers sauteed in a dark basil sauce, topped with a fried egg, served with jasmine rice. The flavors have so much depth and we're very excited to see how they are going to expand the menu offerings. Go try this place!!!

I'm giving it three stars because it would be nice to have a choice of something besides spring roll with the lunch and although the flavors are good there seems to be a lack of variety when it comes to the veggies.  There are a lot of peas, carrots, broccoli, etc. and non of the often desired veggies that often show up in Thai cuisine such as napa cabbage, bok choy, etc.  If they spiced up the veggie options the food would be superb!  It's really refreshing to have a BYOB option in the North Hills and I love the little patio they have outside.  I know they haven't been there that long but I imagine once they take some time to really get that set up, maybe add some ivy etc. to block out road and noise it could be quite nice.  I know Pusadees Garden in Lawrenceville does just that with their small outdoor space and they are always packed.  People love a nice outside atmosphere and this place certainly has potential for that!",
