I recommend this restaurant for anyone that wants slightly adventurous food, but doesn't want to go too far off the beaten path.  The spice levels are stronger than I'm used to. Order a lower number. You can always add more spice, but it's hard to take it out.",

That's my favorite Thai dish of all time with bok choy, rice noodles and the best crispy thai fried chicken that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. It was very comparable in both taste and price to Pusadee's. I also got to try a pork steam bun which made for a nice little appetizer. You get two buns per order. The only downsides to this joint is that they won't seat you until your whole party is there and it is cash only. I really don't think there is any legit reason to be cash-only in 2018. It is just the cost of business to be able to process card transactions.",

I've been here several times with friends, and each time I've always enjoyed my eating experience. All the foods I've tried, including the Pad See Ew and Street Noodle 2, have been super tasty. One thing to note is spice levels as they may vary between dishes with recipes that already have lots of spices and those that don't. They also have takeout, which might come in handy for packing a quick meal for the next day when school gets busy. Highly recommend this place for some quality food!!",

The first time was a bit of a bit we knew that as we arrived on a Saturday around 8:00pm. It's a cash only spot and they also don't have a telephone in the place.   Once we were seated we were given a thing of water and the waiter came shortly after. We ordered the Thai crispy chicken and pulled pork buns as an appetizer. It was pretty good but the price can't be beat. You get a fair portion in comparison to the price.  We ordered the street  noodle with fried shrimp and I enjoyed it. They have five levels of spicy and I opted for the 2 and felt it for sure. Keep that in mind when ordering as I'm sure the waiter will remind you. It's also a BYOB place and we were charged 50 cent each for a recycling fee.   We did end up coming here Sunday for lunch before departing back for Philadelphia. I would go here again for sure as the price can't be beat.",

    "text": "We stopped by during a road trip through Pittsburgh. The place was packed. Was seated relatively quickly (about a 5 min wait).  Ordered the Sukothai, Chiang Mai, Street Noodle #1, and Kee Mao. We ordered medium spiciness for everything; however, the spiciness of each dish seemed to vary by quite a bit.  The Sukothai was by far the best dish. The lime broth goes really well with the rice noodles, and gives the dish a great kick. The Chiang Mai had good flavor. It was a curry-based noodle dish, and was a great deal sweeter. Street noodle #1 was just imho spaghetti noodles with fried chicken cutlets. Nothing special here, I would avoid. Kee mao is like pad see yew. Very standard, but very tasty. Was also very very spicy.  Ultimately, Noodlehead would be one of those places that I'd keep coming back to for quick and good food if I was a Pittsburgh resident. The dishes themselves taste excellent, but feel more like re-hashes of familiar (and thus comfortable) flavors.  This is all fine and dandy at the end of a long day when cooking is just a chore. If you're looking for something unique and special, however, I'd say to look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Decent place, except for big boobs on a power trip.   Stopped here on our month-long road trip because of great reviews. After placing our order, husband and I chatted about how beautiful the space was, the floral arrangement, the design, the decor. We were impressed, enjoying ourselves, and excited about our upcoming meal. I snapped some photos with my phones of the pretty things.  Then a waitress, not ours, walked by and asked why I was taking photos. I was a bit confused but told her they were just for me. Then she said people need to not come here to take photos with their big equipment (though she acknowledged that I was just using my phone, she went on nonetheless...) and how it is annoying when it is busy (it wasn't. Off hours, and there was only one other table besides us. I was nowhere near them. She herself didn't have a table to wait on at the time, and yet...) That I should have asked if i was allowed to take photo, and they would have said no.  Firstly, I would be really surprised that such hipster restaurant or any business these days would have a problem with customers taking personal PHONE photos while there.   Secondly, even if I was mistaken, a simple \"Would you mind not taking photos?\" would have sufficed. Or better yet, a sign. Although I see plenty of photos from customers online, so I am not sure if someone was just in the mood to show off that day or what.  We ate through many different states in a month, and this was the worst we were treated. Shame, it was such a beautiful place. I love the concept, cash only, no phone, and all, and enjoyed the food ok. Would have been great without the rude chest-puffing encounter.",

The atmosphere is modern and fun, but my friend and I did find this place to be very cold, temperature wise.  We ordered the Thai fried chicken ($6.50) to start, and it was delicious.  I wouldn't consider it a show-stopper, and I would probably try a different appetizer next time.  It was good, though.  I ordered the Street Noodles #2 ($9) for lunch, which was thin egg noodles, tempura shrimp, bok choy, cilantro.  I kept the spice mild because our server said the food was naturally more spicy than normal.  I would disagree with this, but there is a spicy sauce on the table for do your own spicy!  So it was not an issue.  The dish was delicious.  Plenty of shrimp and enough for lunch the next day!  Our service was great!  The only major drawback is that parking can be challenging.",

The water had come out of a fridge but for some reason it was rather warm than cold. We ordered our food quickly. Two Pad thai's (shrimp and tofu) and the thai fried chicken.   The fried chicken was great, very nice crisp to it and the meat was juicy and hot. The chicken comes with a sweet chili sauce for dipping which really complimented it well. Too bad I can't say the same for the pad thai. ALthough it was hot and well cooked it had absolutely no flavor. It wasn't sweet or salty but just tasted like raw noodles and veggies. I had to ask for some chili sauce to give it that sweet flavor I like.   The service by the way, very very slow. We waited for sauce and food containers for nearly 20 minutes. It's BYOB here which is awesome (BEER & Wine) but i think it has BYOS too (Bring your own service). I hope you have a butler like Niles or Jeffery.",

First of all it was a huge serving. Second,  it was just delicious.  So many nuances of different flavors. This was one of those dishes where I could have licked the bowl. And spicy just enough.  Also had an extra hot Ginger Beer.  If you've never tried, try it.  Great service too.  And we got to sit outside on a beautiful day.",

The steamed pork buns are the best appetizer. Be sure you have cash because it's cash only! Its also BYOB.",

    "text": "My parents were recently in town and when asked where they want to eat they asked for that \"noodle\" place the wife and I always talk about. We went over for a late lunch (3pm) and waited about 10mins. Somehow I have never waited more than 10mins, but I have never tried to get a large group wedged into the small dining room. I also have not scoffed at sitting at the bar overlooking the street. The dining room is dimly lit, plants and modest decor. The seats are mainly uncomfortable, but I guess that's intended, seeing as they want you to slurp your noodles and surrender your seat to the next person in line.  And now onto the food. $9 for a generous portion of awesome noodles with chicken, shrimp, or tofu. Should be all you need, but incase you're slow. The sauces are very well done. A balancing act of sweet, sour, spicy, and salty. This balancing act is often attempted as South East Asian food is a similar melting pot as is America. They also mix in fresh veggies which are perfectly cooked.  The spice can be ramped up to 5 which I have not yet braved as 4 is perfect for me. My parents were a little taken by a 2 though and my wife who is Korean and enjoys spice was not happy with a choice of a 3 once. Judge for yourself. $12 with tip is as cheap as it gets.",

    "text": "Last weekend was my 3rd attempt at trying to eat here, but my 1st time actually eating there since I never could find parking. Note: Parking is hard to get so either come for lunch (more parking) or take transportation that doesn't require street parking!  Food: I had the Pad See Yew (with tofu) and it was great! The noodles were cooked well and tasted extremely fresh. Their spicy scale goes from 1-5 and after anticipating a lot of heat from 5, I decided on a 4. I would recommend spicy eaters to just go for the 5, the 4 was not spicy at all.  FOR VEGETARIANS: You can get any of the noodle dishes with tofu, but they do not offer any appetizers (or can alter any current dishes) to accommodate vegetarians. I found this a bit weird, although my friends raved about the pork buns.  Service: The service was good and fast, although if you drink a decent amount of water I would request two jugs of water instead of one. One complaint I have was that the waiter did not check-in with us throughout the meal besides bringing our food, replacing the water after 15 minutes and bringing the check over (of which we had to go to the front of the restaurant to ask for).  Overall: One of the better Thai eateries in Pittsburgh - a definite recommendation! Enjoy!",

My friend and I couldn't finish our food, so we asked for Togo boxes, at first he said we were not allowed to togo our dishes, then when we started to get upset, he went to the kitchen and gave us a couple of containers. After we packed our food, we got the bill and saw that they charged us for each togo box. This restaurant has absolutely ridiculous policies.",

The menu is limited but great and will satisfy your needs and it is cash only and byob! Which is normally a tradition for burghers ..",

The food isn't out-of-this-world - for really good thai, try Smiling Banana Leaf - but the dishes are tasty and satisfying, especially for the price tag. They're not afraid to really up the heat level, which I appreciate. I also love that there are individual bottles of water at each table so that you don't have to constantly bug your server to re-fill your glass. And BYO is always an excellent option. When it's a weekday and not too crowded, I love this place.  On the weekends, it's a whole different beast. They are really not equipped to handle large crowds in the evenings. They don't have a dedicated hostess, and the owner, who frequently assumes this role when he is there, is just not able to give people estimates of how long their waits will be. He's borderline rude about it when people ask. And when you're really hungry and considering a number of restaurants, that's not cool. They also don't take reservations, credit cards, or do take-out (!). They don't even have a phone, apparently, so you can't ask them to call you so you can spend your wait for a table enjoying a drink at at Mad Mex. I appreciate the appeal of a stripped-down approach to a restaurant, but it can make things really inconvenient for the consumer.   So, in short: weekdays, go! On weekend evenings...approach with caution.",

    "text": "People have a tendency to lean toward food trends.  Bacon is a prime example, with recent reports of an imminent bacon shortage in the coming years due to worldwide excessive consumption... that, or we can just blame Randolph and Mortimer Duke for their shady dealings in pork bellies.  So for now, while the supply is still here, I highly recommend the pork belly steam buns.  Simple in nature, complex in flavor.  A crispy exterior with a slightly caramelized Thai glaze gives way to the delicate, rich fattiness of the interior complimented by thinly sliced pickled cucumbers and a sprig of cilantro - all of this wrapped in the warm embrace of a pillowy handmade steam bun.  Imagine if you could eat a warm nap on a crisp autumn night (no really, imagine it)... this is what should pop into your mind.  What people fail to realize is that there are many parts of the pig that can lend that same salty, succulent, tender pork fat that the human mind/body ultimately crave.  Trotters, shoulders, tongue, jowl (which yields a personal favorite, guanciale)... it's gold, Jerry, GOLD!  For those of us that are well aware of these parts, we can only hope that there is no bacon shortage... because if there is, the wannabe food lovers will start coming after the real tasty bits, and that just spells disaster for those that can appreciate the intricacies of flavor and texture spread across the landscape of a freshly slaughtered hog.  For those that want to preserve the porkfat, so to speak, one of the great alternatives is the \"pig wing.\"  The item is not new, but the description is something that caters to that of the typical food illiterate.  It is nothing more than the shank - a simple and widely used item in cuisines around the world... but when prepared correctly, it is transformed into a tender, hot pork popsicle with a built in stick.  The glaze is reminiscent of the aforementioned pork belly, crisp on the outside and lending a higher meat ratio, yet still interlaced with just enough gelatinized fat to leave that little bit of tackiness on the inside of your mouth - something dentists should find a way to harness, because let's face it... it'd be a lot more enjoyable if you have a sticky, slimy coating of pork flavor rather than the grittiness from fluoride covering your tongue when you're walking out of his office.  The Street Noodle #2 features fresh shrimp cooked to just beyond the point of translucency to maintain its natural texture and sweet flavor, accentuated by a light tempura batter that provided a blanket around each shrimp so to absorb the sweet and (mildly) spicy sauce.  Lightly sauteed bok choy was able to maintain a pleasant crunch, while still lending a bit of bitterness to create a harmonious flavor with the sauce.    As with most Thai places, I was excited to see an incremental chart describing the varying heat one may choose.  Unfortunately, my expectations were not met.  The level 4 was described as \"thai hot\", so naturally, I ordered a level 5 \"crazy hot\".  If going by a 5 point scale, my level 5 should have been in the 1.5 - 2 range.  I can understand not many people can tolerate extreme heat, but if you're going to have a chart, make it valid.  I want tear inducing, sinus clearing, face in a bucket of hot tar kind of heat... not a few chili flakes that would make your grandmother tear up.  Service was what it should have been, and I can appreciate the \"no substitutions\" on the menu.  Every now and then you have to trust the chef.  It's the only way to experience other people's passion for food.  First impressions are the ones that stick, and Noodlehead stamped a respectable one in the bottom of my stomach.",

Servers are efficient and this place is fantastic value for money with every dish under $10.00.  The food is great, portions are large but I would advise scaling down a notch on the spice level. I'm not afraid of spicy food but on our recent visit my 'scale 2 spicyness' had me in a sweat! And I wasn't the only one, people on either side of me were gulping water and a man a couple of tables away actually had a nosebleed!  Other than the spice issue everything we ate was delish. We ordered a few small plates for the table to start (the fried snacks were crisp but not at all oily) but you really don't need to as the entree dishes are sufficient by themselves. I'll definitely be back but next time I'm going to get my order chili free and add my own heat from the condiments that are supplied on the table!",

If you're not familiar with the area, you may be circling the area for parking on a week day, but it's worth it. This place is CASH ONLY, so don't forget to grab a few bills before coming in. Not sure why I would label this trendy, but it does embody that kind of place once you step inside.  Since I came on my own, seating was a breeze. I sat at the window at the tall seats on a shared thin table. Kind of funny to be chowing down while people walk staring at you. Pay them no mind as you stuff your face since the food is wonderfully flavored.  I got the street noodles #2 and steamed pork buns. There's 2 buns per order and they go pretty quick as an appetizer. Nice way to start the meal. Then you're greeted with a steaming hot bowl of fresh noodles topped with fresh tempura shrimp and bok choy. The noodles are plentiful and it seemed never ending after awhile. I vaguely remember getting a little bit of spice in my noodles and my nose started running by the middle of the meal (a good sign). Just be sure to keep getting your water refilled, but the spice level is on point here.  If I lived in town, this would be one of my go-to comfort foods. Glad I found this gem while out traveling.",

The only 2 dishes that I am more wary of getting are the: GREEN CURRY LINGUINI and BEEF NOODLE SOUP.

I usually get a 2 when I want a little spice, and my spice tolerance isn't bad.   For appetizers, their THAI FRIED CHICKEN and PORK BELLY STEAMED BUNS are delicious and also worth getting.

For 50 cents per person you can BYOB. Prices are reasonable and there is plenty of seating, but I'd imagine this place gets packed on the weekends.   Tips: this place is cash only, so stop at the ATM, bring along whatever alcohol it is you like to drink, split some appetizers with the table and then order yourself some noodles. if you're cautious about the spice level start low around 0-1. if it's your first time checking it out go during the week so you can avoid long waits.",

Even though we had to wait for a table they kept our wine behind the counter so we didn't have to carry it around shady side.  The server was nice and very helpful for those of us who have never eaten Thai!  We had spring rolls and pork steam buns as an app, they were delicious! Part of me wanted more spring rolls just for my dinner. But, I'm here to try the noodles right!  I had the See Yew with shrimp. I tried the zero level of heat but got some on the side to add myself. It was very yummy! I also added a lot of the spice and woah, I loved it!  My husband had the same dish with chicken, he loved it as well!!  Did I mention how this place is not crazy expensive either?

Really the absolute worst thing about this place is the seating. Not only are you squashed right next to people you don't know but then are forced to sit on hard  wooden/metal stools or benches and only a handfull of a lucky few get a soft seat with a back. It really is very uncomfortable (my back hurt the rest of the night). Not just for your body but some seating is sharing a picnic table with strangers or even worse screaming children (oh joy). Husband and I both ordered veg spring rolls and the street noodles number 1, which was very tasty and the chicken was perfect.   Also on the plus side you can choose how spicy you want any dish.  They were fairly busy and our no ice, lack luster warm tap water didn't quite quench our thirt. Our waiter was also virtually nonexistent.   IT is also BYOB, which were were not aware of so a big thanks to the people next to us for sharing.  Clearly my rating is for tasty food and not much else. We will go back, except for take out.   And PS: Its cash only, but they have an ATM",

I had the Chiang Mai Curry and it was for lack of better words to articulate-AMAZING!  I got a level 3 out of 5 and it was the perfect combination of spice. The curry was outstanding as well were the noodles.  I am picky about meat when it comes to most restaurants but noodlehead prepared the chicken perfectly. It was not too soft but not hard, it was kind of like having some tofu or Indian paneer. Service, I would give a 3 out of 5. Our server seemed very annoyed; however, food arrived promptly.  The only cons I would say would be this is a CASH ONLY restaurant (however, there is a on site ATM) and there is no alcohol menu (it is BYOB.) Despite this, I would highly recommend noodlehead. The food outweighs all.",

    "text": "While looking for some Asian food in the area Noodlehead came up as a top Yelp result. Maybe being from California has given me some unrealistically high standards for Asian food outside the state, but I thought this place was alright. It seems like a pretty popular restaurant so we did have to wait a bit before getting seated, and it's CASH ONLY.   Service was meh. I ordered Street Noodles #2 (egg noodles and tempura shrimp). Everything tasted fresh and I liked that they didn't completely drown their noodles in soup/sauce. I recommend ordering with the spice on the side, as it's pretty spicy. The spice powder has a great flavor in itself, so it's nice to be able to sprinkle in on at your own discretion. The shrimp was delicious, and they were pretty generous with the amount of shrimp, but the meal itself was pretty small. If I was hungrier I definitely could've finished the whole thing (which is saying a lot because I almost never finish my restaurant meals). There weren't very many sprouts or bok choy in the dish either. It was about 10 shrimps and a small portion of noodles for $12 (including tip), which isn't super worth it to me.   Again, I'm not sure how the other eateries in the city are, but coming from California this place was okay.",

Usually when you get Thai you can expect some saltiness (that's half the fun), however not to the point where it makes the dish inedible. It tasted like they dumped fish sauce directly on top of the noodles and then mixed in a ridiculous amount of salt and called it a day. The shrimp on top of the noodles was clearly of poor quality (it appeared as though they were trying to mask the quality by drowning it in breading to the point where it was also inedible).The only reason it gets three stars is because there was a cool atmosphere and the pork bun appetizer was half decent (would give it a 2.5 if I could),other than that do yourself a favor and stay far far away.",

    "text": "You say \"pork bun,\" I say \"I'm there.\" Which is why I'm so happy to have gone to Noodlehead where they have the buns in the style made popular by Momofuku. Crisp pickles, cilantro, steamed bun, and pork belly. Granted, it's not THE best pork belly I've ever had, but it was really satisfying and pretty cheap for an order (which was two buns, not one).  Now, you say \"pad thai,\" and I say \"I will eat any pad thai, but the best in Pittsburgh is still at Spice Island.\" That being said, it was still really good. I also tried a tempura shrimp and was immediately jealous, because it was perfectly fried. But, I stuck to my well-portioned Pad Thai and was happy it was just enough noodles, because I wouldn't have been able to stop eating it.  My only disappointment about the food choices is that you're really limited if you're vegan or a vegetarian who doesn't eat shrimp. Tofu isn't an option for your protein, and for the same price to say \"just leave off the meat\" you should really get something in replacement.  Noodlehead keeps their menu simple (and filled with delicious cilantro and lime), and their costs down, by saying these dishes are $6 or $9, here are some appetizers, here are some drinks, seat yourself, plastic chopsticks or utensils are at your table already, if you want beer or wine you bring it (.50 corkage per person), cash only.  The space is beautiful still from when it was a more upscale restaurant (Typhoon), delightfully juxtaposed with picnic tables, well-loved cafe tables, noodle bar seating, and other various mis-matched tables. They played good music (Amy Winehouse for the duration of our meal), they staff was really nice, and it just made a great place for a date. A casual, low-pressure, intimate date.",

Appetizers aside, the menu consists of tasty thai-styled noodles with your choice of chicken, beef, shrimp, or tofu (from mild to very spicy).  Basically, it's like a slightly edgier Thai version of PF Chang's (e.g., the shrimp are breaded and fried). I had the Street noodles #1 with shrimp and pork buns as an appetizer, which were not totally authentic, but delicious. There are a few non-alcoholic drinks, but it's BYOB.   The atmosphere is warm and visually interesting, good for a causal dinner with friends or a date. I hope that this place makes it. It's a great addition to the Highland Ave/Penn Circle set of restaurants.",

The Pork Belly Steamed Buns are a favorite of mine as well for an appetizer.   The restaurant is BYOB and cash only. They do have an ATM in the back of he restaurant. Noodlehead does not have a public phone number and therefore, you are unable to make a reservation or place an order for takeout over the phone.

We had - Thai Fried Chicken, battered chicken tender. In Thailand it is more common to use chicken drumsticks or wings, but Noodlehead does good job, and chicken tender doesn't take away any good-authentic taste. - Sukothai, GREAT! I made just only one mistake for not ordering it really spicy. I had 3 level spicy in stead of what I should have done - 5 level. It would have been fantastic. - Love Boat, FANTASTIC! I had it with 3 level spicy and no complaint!   We look forward to going back again soon.",

    "text": "You're still The One, Noodlehead.  A year after our first visit we returned to Pittsburgh (for another concert! Why are acts skipping over Cleveland?) and Noodlehead was to be our first stop! I have been dreaming of the pork buns and their sweet/spicy marinade for the past 16 months and I was NOT disappointed!  On this trip, in addition to the mouth-watering pork buns, we ordered the Chiang Mai Curry and the Pad Kee Mao - both at a spice rating of '1' - and they were spot-on! I am getting hungry just thinking about them now.  This is my best pointer for a trip to Noodlehead: be sure to note that their spice scale is not the same as your average American Asian restaurant. Whereas I usually order medium-spicy at most Thai spots, at Noodlehead I can barely handle the 2/5 spice level and find 1/5 more comfortable. You've been warned!   That being said, come to Noodlehead, bring your dry sauvignon blancs and light lagers and your cash, and enjoy some of the best Thai street food in the Rust Belt!",

Shoutout to the blonde Korean who asked me beforehand if I wanted oyster sauce in it - thank goodness because I'm vegan. This place is really accommodating for vegetarians/vegans.   They only take cash, but it's worth it! Pretty good size for their crowd, too. The ambiance was chill, food was served pretty quickly. Will be back again.",

For the noodles ordered it at a level 3. First few bites were delicious. After the initial bites, my mouth was on fire and my tastebuds were shot. Couldn't taste or feel anything but heat. The second time I came here I ordered the kee mao again except at a level 1. It was much more manageable but still very spicy. So lesson learned. Order the level 1 if you can't handle spicy.",

The heat scale is totally messed up! You choose your spiciness on the dishes you order - and they do tell you that things can get pretty spicy but when your scale is from 1 to 5 and a 2 is already insanely hot I cannot even imagine what a 5 would be. My husband and I are not sensitive to heat either. A 5 has to be completely inedible - like that idiot you know at a chili potluck who just wants to make the most spicy stupid volcano chili that no one can eat. I want to come back to this place because it was really good and modern and prices were good, but I will take my spice a level down for sure.",

We waited over 30 minutes for a table. The hostess, a pregnant brunette, thought she was doing us a favor by pushing two tables together. That would have been fine, but one of the tables was small and round. So all 5 of us didn't really fit.  We had just ordered when a large table opened up. When I politely asked the hostess if we could move, she was rude...wagged her finger at us and said, \"oh no no...these people have been waiting\". Ok, so had we. And they could have taken our table.   The dinner service was also slow and the server didn't even speak to us. Thankfully, the food was good as usual.  Lesson leaned. Avoid NH during dinner.",

Honestly, the pulled pork steam buns are enough of a meal for me (as long as I get 2 orders) but I've ordered the noodles before too and they're fantastic as well.  There's really no way to avoid a crowd whatsoever, so be prepared to wait and have some patience; I promise the food is well worth it.  On rare occasions they've left me waiting/forgotten about me either outside at the tables or at the window bar inside, so I recommend insisting on a table. I've never been forgotten about there (though if a comped drink is more your thing, feel free to sit at those spots)  They're BYOB and have a small charge for it, but no biggie. I also like they have a reusable glass water bottle system. Very environmentally friendly! Also, they are CASH only but have an ATM for your convenience.  I'll keep going back here forever :) the food more than makes up for the long wait times!",

Make sure to bring cash and that who ever you're eating with is there or else you won't be seated!  Every thing has so much flavor and it's served to you hot! Nothing comes cold!  The sweet potato taste like something from thanksgiving but wrapping in Thai culture it's so awesome! The spring rolls are to die for... the noodles are great like you can't go wrong but the chicken is a solid choice and the tofu is cooked fully unless you want it other wise, for the vegans that like their tofu a little tough...  this place is great stop by it's worth the wait if you don't want to do something while you wait go next door to try some amazing ice cream!",

First of all I've tried more dishes, and let me just say that the green curry clam dish was not a dish I found worth ordering again . There was barely any clam meat in my dish and overall it just didn't work together flavor wise. Try the pad see ew instead! Although I notice that the dishes overall are all pretty salty.   I've noticed that the spice consistently is very inconsistent at this place. I've ordered a three stars and experienced everything from pleasant strong kick of flavor to running to the bathroom after eating as my stomach groaned in protest. My advice: don't get any spice instead.   Overall I think Noodlehead just needs to be more consistent but still one of the best places in Pittsburgh to get Thai food!",

In the past, my spouse and I would go to the same Asian Fusion restaurant that was just down the street, but when we got there we learned that they had permanently closed. Disappointed, we scrolled through yelp, looking for a nearby restaurant with similar cuisine. We saw that Noodlehead was rated as affordable and with 4.5 stars. We decided to check it out. It was incredible! Our server turned out to be the manager, Pam, and she told us that she recommends getting a lower spice level and then adding more if we need it. We got 3/5 for both the Green Curry and the Kee Mao (see pictures). They were delicious. My spouse and I agree that the Kee Mao is particularly flavorful. We also tried that dumplings, but I forgot to take a picture.   We have now recommended this place to all of our family and friends who ask. Next time we will bring a bottle of wine to take advantage of the BYOB.   Thanks Pam! We are looking forward to our next visit!",

Some of my favorites include the See Yew noodles with tofu and the Chiang Mai curry, which also allows for a tofu substitution instead of chicken. The See Yew strikes a balance between saucy noodles and vegetables, while the Chiang Mai successfully delivers a flavorful curry sauce with subtle hints of coconut. Furthermore, the addition of the Green Curry Linguine to the menu is a welcome change for guests who want a sharper, less sweet curry. The Kee Mao also is delicious and is less sweet than the See Yew. Honestly, I could go on and on with my praise for Noodlehead's food!  Some things to note: this is a BYOB restaurant, with a wine and spirits store right down the street! Additionally, it is cash only (ATM in the back) and reservations are not accepted, so wait times can get long on Friday or Saturday nights or with large parties. However, the food is more than worth the wait.  Afterwards, be sure to stop by Millie's ice cream next door for some desert :)",

    "text": "5 stars all around. I love noodle head!! This was my second time here and I'll definitely be back for more. Upon entering, the atmosphere is pretty chill. The tables are sat close together which makes it a little tight, but it's nothing uncomfortable. We were seated and then immediately given water. The server gave us enough time to look over the menu and promptly came back once she could tell we were ready to order.   We ordered spring rolls for an appetizer and I got the green curry linguine with spicy level 1.  The spring rolls were out almost immediately and they were fabulous. Light and airy but also stuffed perfectly. And I love the sauce that come with it! For the future though, I might have to order an extra order because it only comes with two very tiny rolls. Now the Green Curry Linguine.. incredible. I got tofu in mine and it was cooked perfectly. Sometimes tofu can get cooked weird and have a very chewy texture, but Noodlehead cooked theirs so nicely! It was crispy but also soft. And all of the veggies that came with the dish paired perfectly together and were also cooked to perfection. The eggplant was so soft and dreamy. The spice level was perfect too. I know that they take their spices seriously here so I didn't want to risk not liking a dish due to it being too spicy so I kept it on the safe side with a level 1. It was the ideal amount of spicy! I wouldn't get anything spicier though in my opinion.   Overall, the service here is quick, friendly, and the food is impeccable. I have been raving about this place to all of my friends and I can't wait to bring them all here! *****CASH ONLY******",

    "text": "We have found Noodlehead to be very reliable in quality and the amount of food, but overall, the quality seems to be a bit lacking. The spicy can be all over the place, no matter what spice level you order, but the spice doesn't overwhelm the other flavors in the dish.  Additionally, I do commend them for accommodating gluten free dietary restrictions, although clearly marking these options somewhere could be helpful when diners are choosing their food while waiting in line for a table (which can take 20+ minutes depending on the day--this place in bumpin'!)  That being said, their new online ordering tool, although helpful, has weird functionality and won't let you order some dishes if you choose the gluten free option on the list of modifications available. And it also seemed like some gluten free options were listed online, so that was a little confusing. What makes it worse is that they don't have any phone line to call about questions, so we had to go in to order instead.  Overall, Noodlehead is a solid, dependable choice for dinner when you have a hankering for some good Thai-inspired noodles, but there are still a couple of things that keep this place from being our go-to noodle place. That being said, we will definitely be returning again, since their portions are generous, especially for the price.",

    "text": "Noodlehead was really pretty average in my opinion. They definitely do a good job of creating a cool, hip atmosphere, but at times they make practical sacrifices to do so. For example, a lot of their single tables are pretty squished together, and you might end up at communal seating with strangers. Not a problem in itself, but if you were looking for a quiet place to eat out with your person, this might not be your best bet.  I got Street Noodle #2 with level 0 spice, and it was very tasty, even without the kick.  The restaurant is cash only, so be prepared.  Again, I thought Noodlehead was perfectly average overall. I gave it an extra star though because their tea is amazing, hot or iced. If you stop by Noodlehead, definitely don't skip the tea!",

Maybe the restaurant was too vibrant (at 9:15PM), the Street Noodle #1 was served instead of Sukothai.  Anyhow, we gobbled up the noodles.  Pad Thai was too exciting, but the Street Noodle #1 was a real surprised.  The fried pork chop was really abundant.  And the noodle was prepared with strong lemongrass aroma.  Bok choy and bean sprouts sautes in sweet spicy broth that truly left a strong impression in your mouth.  The prices are reasonable for college students.  Even our Uber round trip fare is about the same as the noodles cost, I enjoyed my first night in Pittsburg very much.",

Local college students frequent this BYOB spot for celebratory occasions, so I can get down with the hip factor. I enjoyed the sweet potato triangles, Chiang Mai curry and Street Noodles #1 (the fried chicken is fantastic). The See Yew could have had a smokier flavor, but then again, we're not in Thailand here.   Cash only, but don't worry - each dish is under $10.

For mains, I always get one of the street noodles. They are so good. The prices are also excellent. The atmosphere is fun as well and I always enjoy a BYOB. My only complaints are that they are cash only and I always forget (and I never have cash!) and that they won't seat you until your whole party is present. They get very busy, so it does make sense, but when you have 5/6 there and waiting on one person to find parking it can set your meal back much longer than necessary. However, it's definitely a favorite in Shadyside for me.",

We got some of the spring roll appetizer, they come with two per order. They are small but the two were the perfect portion for one to munch on while waiting for your food. The sauce that comes with them is delicious!!!! I couldn't get enough of it. We got an order of the pig wings, they were just ok. And we got an order of the steamed pork buns. The pork on it was amazing and everyone at our table really liked them, but I wasn't a fan of the bun. Deffinately different and nice to try! For dinner we got the shrimp see yew and the street fried chicken option. They were both to die for!! And they give you a huuuge portion!!!! After eating our meals, it didn't even look like we put a dent in them. Plenty to take home or to even split and share if you wanted! This place is byob with no corkage fee, and the server was very nice! We sat at a round high top table for a group of 5 and it was perfect. There was no wait when we arrived either. The atmosphere is super cute and not too loud inside either! Will absolutely be back!! Ps.. cash only! But they do have an atm inside in the back!",

    "text": "It's been very interesting to see how noodle head has evolved over the many years I have been going. This is my favorite spur of the moment noodle place. 4.5 stars is my actual score.   They have changed their spice ingredients a few times over the years, which has changed the core flavors of several of their dishes. They remain consistently fun, enjoyable at the drop of a hat, and seem to be doing better than ever.   When we were first coming here this would have been a five star review but over the last few years, possibly from just the number of times we have been, there are occasional inconsistencies in the spice levels or flavors, but most of the time it is spot on perfect.   The place is almost always busy with predominantly college-age kids with their parents crowd, but do not let that deter you. This is one of Pittsburgh's better thai noodle places.   It is not the best for authenticity given some modernized takes on Thai, but it has been a perennial favorite because of the accessibility and reliability of their limited but strong menu. It is a place I show all my visiting friends and family because it is simply stated, a good time and a typically very good dinner experience, just not the #1 in town that nabs the 5 star review.   They have recently added an online ordering service which is a nice touch. They still do not take phone orders and are still cash only, but this has not seemed to slow down their business over time. It is a very noisy place when full, so be warned. The aesthetic is very nice though and has been consistent through all the years. Bathrooms are top-notch and always very clean.   This is best for a large family gathering or gathering of friends, not a formal dinner or with young children.",

Since the menu is not too big, we ordered quickly. I had the Kee Mao with tofu, spice level of 2.   Overall the noodles were cooked well and it was a hearty portion. I just did not think they were anything special. They are definitely good for only $9, but I was expecting a little more flavor. My friend got the Chiang Mai Curry and she said it was delicious but needed more noodles. She ended up having a lot of the curry leftover. Overall, a decent meal but not worth an hour wait.",

I ordered the pad Thai and it was excellent. I like spicy but noticed that on the menu it said you can always add heat, but not take it away. I only ordered spice level one and it had a bite - didn't need to add anything extra. Will definitely be stopping again. Also - if you like iced tea, be sure to try their lemongrass tea.

Send the entrees at the appropriate time so the moment you're bussing our app plates the entrees arrive.  Coursing 101.  We had both courses and about 2/3 of the way in the waitress did a drive by and said \"everything good?\" and kept walking.  A different waiter dropped off water.  We didn't see our waitress for another 20 minutes easy.  We had long been done so I went to the counter to get a check.  A different waiter was making change at the register.  I was invisible to him.  The hostess came up 3 different times.  I was invisible to her to.  Finally the waiter asked what I needed.  \"We haven't seen our waitress in 30 mins.

The so called Love Bowl noodle soup is noodles in a bowl of sweet soy sauce, not really so called soup.  It's like drinking soy sauce.  The 3 other dishes me and my group ordered were also unimpressive. Portions are quite small.  The dishes are kind of like those from Chinese fast food takeouts. This place is totally overrated. Not coming again.",

    "text": "Okay, Noodlehead. You have a modern-looking website, so the fact that you don't accept credit cards or even have a telephone can't be explained by the fact that you are run by adorably old school folks who don't understand how the modern world works. Nope, you understand just fine...you just choose to play by your own rules. And given how packed it was when we were here, it seems that people are are willing to accept the fact that they have to order in person if they want take out, aren't able to make reservations, and have to use cash to pay for their food.  While I do find those aforementioned things annoying and inconvenient (come on, does anyone really carry cash around anymore?!), I did enjoy my dinner at Noodlehead. With no way of making reservations, we just showed up and hoped the wait wouldn't be too long. It was about 30 minutes on a Saturday night, which isn't bad. We were given seats at the bar that overlooks Highland Ave, so the people watching was fun (apologies to the table dining outside right beside the window, though....nothing is more uncomfortable than having people staring at you as you eat your food....but in our defense, it was literally unavoidable for you to be in our field of vision!)  Anyway, the vibe of this restaurant is quite trendy and modern, and it's quite loud here. Their menu is fairly small. For our meals, I ordered the Street Noodles #1 (Thai fried chicken, rice noodles, bok choy, sprouts, cilantro) and hubby ordered Chiang Mai Curry (egg noodles, chicken, greens, and shallots in a curry sauce). You can choose your spice level, and be aware that they take their spiciness seriously....so don't try to be a hero and go for the highest level unless you're sure you can handle it.  Our food came out in short order, which was fortuitous because we were hungry. My street noodles was a generous portion, although I was bummed that my dish seemed to be missing the promised cilantro (I'm a huge fan of cilantro). But lack of cilantro aside, the dish was still quite tasty. The sauce was an interesting blend of sweet, spicy, and sour. The noodles soaked up most of the sauce, so there was plenty of flavor throughout the dish. The Thai friend chicken was very moist and had good flavor, but the breading was a bit soggy in spots, which was disappointing. The dish would've been better if the chicken had been crispier. My husband's Chiang Mai noodles were delicious....loved the rich, creamy, coconutty sauce in this dish.   While it's not my favorite Thai food in Pittsburgh, it's definitely one of the more unique takes on Thai food, and certainly good enough for a repeat visit. Oh, and BYOB as well. Enjoy!",

I'm used to Indian cuisine, so to me, this was a perfect level of heat without it being too much. However, if you are used to milder flavors, I would definitely go down a spice level or two.

Parking was a breeze to get - thanks to Pittsburgh, we were able to get a spot directly across from the restaurant (and it was free parking after 6)! Being from Philly, that's pretty incredible on a Friday night. We were seated almost immediately outside, and were given waters along with the menu. The food selection was great, even for vegetarians like us - we ordered the Kee Mao and See Yew with tofu instead of other proteins. The Kee Mao had a 3 level of spice, which I found to be a perfect amount of heat. They have a bottle of Sriracha at the table if you'd like to be more brave. I didn't try the See Yew but heard that it was delicious as well. The portion sizes were also great, just enough to feel satiated but not so much to over-stuff.  Pricing was also great - only $9 per dish! Service was very friendly and sociable (almost seemed like the waiter was just a casual friend on the street who came up and asked for our order! We got our food quickly and were given our change back promptly as well. Every other review says this, too, but cash only. All in all, a huge thumbs up and I would definitely come back here soon!",

The Pad Thai itself was fairly good but seemed to be missing some flavour. Wondering if they use Nam Pla (fish sauce) because if they are, I didn't notice and am thinking that was one of the missing flavours. Nicely decorated place with funky music in the back not too loud.

I ordered the see yew with a spice level of 2, knowing that I wanted something with a tiny kick, but that I can't stand too much spice. The noodles were fat and done to perfection, and this dish reminded me of pad Thai without the peanuts. If you aren't tolerant of too much spice like me, do not go beyond level 2!

    "text": "While this is technically a review for Noodlehead, I'm going to preface by acknowledging that I stick to two plates here.   Two things still uphold the quality of this review:   1. I've eaten those same two plates multiple times per month since this place opened [and the consistency is amazing] 2. Two plates still covers 10-15% of the menu [it's a small menu].   And what are those two plates [you're no doubt exhausted from wondering]? They are the Pork-Belly Steamed Buns and the Chiang Mai.   Should you try them? [Subjectively] Yes, yes, and also yes.   One or the other would easily fall into my top five plates in the city. They'd probably both have a spot in my top ten. They are delicious in all the right ways. Great flavors, textures, perfect for now or to take home for later.   In addition, Noodlehead has a great space. We're always comfortable. It's energetic when full and chill when less full [read: it's never empty]  In all honesty, the only downsides to Noodlehead are that it's cash only and they have no listed phone to call in an order. I \"get\" the decision behind both of those and neither would ever stop me from eating there, but they are minor inconveniences.",

    "text": "Not bad. This place threw me off initially, wit the \"seat yourself\" sign. I was actually hunting for what I thought might be \"Typhoon.\" Said screw it, walked inside. The decor seems purposefully cobbled together with random items, sliding barn doors, barrels, but mixed in with glass and steel.  Food. Good. Only peeve about this is that I'm pescatarian, so I am pretty limited to eating stuff with tofu and/or shrimp. I wish they had more veggie options for appetizers. Since they don't do subs or removals, don't even bother thinking of asking about it. Easier on the kitchen taff, harder on you. But, i can roll with the minimalism.  Also, the spice levels. I asked initially is it \"American-style hot\" or \"Thai-Style hot.\" Think Thai-style plus \"Holy Crap.\" They go wild in the kitchen. I went for a 3 on the 5 scale and was on fire. I like the heat, but the cooks have to cool out with whatever they are doing in there. I now go for level 1 on the scale, then add hot sauce to taste. Even that was scary. I put a dime's worth of sauce on some Pad Thai, and that lit up the whole plate. I'm not an American wuss, but I was struggling.   The staff service is OK, mostly friendly, but I think that when the traffic ramps up, you can see the stress on servers faces. Understandable, but a little distracting.   I love the drink menus. Mexican Coke? For the win.   All in all, not bad, but could use an extra \"something.\"",

Trendy atmosphere and quick service. Pad Thai was super-peanuty, which is just the way I like it.  The limited cons:  Cash only, no biggie, but just something to note. Parking can be a slight PITA on South Highland.  I recommend parking on Alder and walking up. Limited menu.  All the basics are there, though.  Overall, enjoyable experience and will be back.  As far as Thai food is concerned, I do think there are better places in the city.  If you are looking for an inexpensive date night, Noodlehead is a great option.",

I am writing this review because Noodlehead does NOT have a phone or I would have called to talk to a manager. I went to the restaurant today. As I waited for my order, I witnessed a waitress/hostess with long blonde hair (few dread locks in the back) who was so terribly rude/mean/disrespectful to several customers. She threw her hands in the air to a lady who was inquiring about a few empty tables and said very rudely and loudly and in the lady's face, \"Be My Guest, take the table!  It is meant for larger parties, but go ahead and do what you want\" And then she threw a glass bottle with such force into the garbage can where I was sitting, it broke in the can. Next, several men were standing in her way and she very rudely said, \"move over there, you are directly in my way\"... Not, \"excuse me\"..    Customer service and good food go hand in hand. I hope the people who pay her to work for them know how she is treating THEIR paying customers!   I am giving a 2 because of the atmosphere today. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed for the customers.",

    "text": "I'm SO PUMPED about Noodlehead! Let's get the high points right out there: tasty, cheap, adorable atmosphere, great service. Oh, and it's a BYO! Woot woot!  I hit this place up on a Sunday evening with 2 friends. I had the Phad See Ew with chicken with 1 star of spiciness (you can order it up to level 5). One thing I noticed right away was the serving size: NORMAL. Like not \"I'm a huge fatso\" size. Just right for one person to actually eat the whole thing and not feel disgustingly overfull. And this is a good thing, because it was DE-LICIOUS, so you are going to eat it all. Very fresh, not drowning in oil, yummy-fabulous. I paired it with the lemongrass honey iced tea which was tart and sweet and crisp. Excellent.  Both of my tablemates had the Chiang Mai Curry with tofu (you can select your meat: chicken, tofu, shrimp) which was also yummy--kind of made me wish I could have ordered both!  The menu is definitely restricted: about 4 appetizers, 3 small noodle plates, and maybe 6 entree sized noodle plates. This makes me happy: I'd much rather see a small menu of excellent food than one that's like an encyclopedia of culinary crap.  I'll definitely be hitting Noodlehead up again: the prices are incredible ($6-$12) and the food is great, so this will easily become a regular on my list!!",

    "text": "I'm somewhat of an expert on Thai Food. By expert, I mean that I eats it and I likes it. Lots.  I was very pleasantly surprised to see Noodlehead pop up and scouted it out for awhile until I got the chance to go. I went on a slow Saturday afternoon and was pleasantly surprised.  The decor is very trendy looking, but the seating is very uncomfortable. It feels like they just rummaged through a bunch of yard sales buying reusable pieces of stuff that they fixed up for the place. I'm not a fan of communal table dining at all, so negative for that as well.  BUT WHO CARES, BECAUSE THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC.   I've tried the steamed pork buns, the sliced grilled beef, and the love boat soup. All were baseline delish, but the pork buns were the best.  I typically go for the Shangmai curry noodle dish and love creamy richness of the curry, even if spice level 1 is enough to blow my face off. I like my food with spice to it and this place seems to waver between American-hot and Thai-hot. I think it depends on the cook, but I'm pretty sure the spiciness at this place actually enhances the flavor and doesn't just distract you from whatever it is you're supposed to be tasting.   Tried street noodle #2 and would have liked more sauce with the dish and was unimpressed. It was a big mound of tempura shrimp, a laughable amount of noodles in comparison and a somewhat bland sauce.   It is a bit annoying that it's a cash only establishment, but I get the need for it. As long as the prices stay low (and they are QUITE low compaired to other thai places in the city, especially for the amount of food you get) I'll deal.   Check it out, you won't be disappointed!",

The only downfall is that the menu is limited but they definitely make up for it with quality of awesomeness. The overall atmosphere reminds me of an old Chipotle, but it's simple and that's what I enjoyed the most. They're not confused with their brand trying to make it like a \"fancy, Chinese restaurant\". I always get the Pork Belly Steamed Buns (without cilantro because I think cilantro is made from Satan's feces) and chicken Pad Thai - medium spice. The portion size is generous so be prepared to eat too much or you know, just take some home. I've been there almost every weekend for the past month and honestly wish I could go everyday. Everyone there is super nice and actually enjoy working there so that's a definite plus. Make sure to have cash because well, it's cash only. There are a few ATM's within walking distance just in case you forget.  If you haven't gone already, go and eat enough for me, too.",

    "text": "I had a good experience at Noodlehead recently.  It was a study meeting with a classmate from CMU.  I ordered the Phad See Ew with Tofu at a five star spiciness and she ordered the Phad Thai at three stars with shrimp.  There was seating available and we were acknowledged an seated right away.  The waitress had to ask and affirm our order three times before she gave it to the kitchen (she was nice but I expect she was new).  The cost was pretty good in Pittsburgh standards, under $10 per entree.    The food was served relatively quickly, perhaps 15-20 minutes after we ordered.  The five star spiciness was short of the extremely hot moniker they gave the food (note that they advertised four stars as Thai Spicy).  I would have given the meal a three star spicy rating in Seattle, as I didn't even break a sweat (so considerably less spicy that what I would expect from their rating system.)  Even so, the flavor profile was very good and the noodles were well done with a good amount of fresh veggies (napa cabbage and broccoli).  The portions were a good size as well.  I was temped to pack half of the entree for lunch the next day.  I Pittsburgh this is a four star experience.  I would have rated it at three stars if it were in any of the major cities on the west coast.  I will definitely return - consistency will determine whether it gets bumped up to a 'Pittsburgh' five or downgraded to a three.",

We had the bun thingy along with the suko thai and the love boat. It reminded me of the great food I had in the streets of Bangkok.

Best of all are the (relatively) lost cost, but delicious noodle dishes. Yes, they might be more than what you would pay at a divey place in Oakland, but here, you are paying for ambiance and the convenience of Shadyside.  Veggie options are limited to the three $9 specials. However, they will also do the Chiang Mai noodles with tofu, so keep that in mind. The hubster had the Pad See Ew, which he said was very good, and I really enjoyed the Chiang Mai noodles. Not too spicy or peanuty. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "I just moved to Pittsburgh from Boston, and am on a mission to find really great Asian places. With parents from Vietnam, good Southeast Asian food is a must. Noodlehead has cool decor and a fantastic vibe. More importantly, the flavor combinations are dead-on authentic. Not overly sweet or salty (as happens with places that rely on MSG). The noodle soups were rich, and the stir-frys (i.e. the Pad see yews, etc.) had a lot of what the Chinese call \"wok hei,\" or dragon's breath (<a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FWok%23Wok_hei&s=1b20f5a7dc73f87d0f1375a47086f9991c5d73f19727a740206379545d21f602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wo...</a>)--a certain quality of food that has been cooked fast and well over extremely high heat. The menu is limited, but that means every dish is consistently cooked to perfection, and that the prices are kept low ($9 for everything on the menu except the sukothai and the love boat, which are $6 each). The adjustable spiciness level for every dish is also a huge plus. My mom, who is super picky about Asian food, loved Noodlehead so much that we came here twice while she was visiting me.  P.S. This place is BYOB",

After making sure that there is no cilantro in my dishes things have been peachy keen.  For snacks, I always order the pork belly steam buns (there are two). Two just aren't enough and you'll be wanting more. Thai fried chicken is another one of those salty satisfying bites too. The garlic-nam pla chicken (quantity of four) was tasty as well and had a sweet savory dipping sauce though I prefer the thai fried chicken. Be careful as they are extremely hot straight out from the kitchen!  Green curry linguine is heavier than some of the other dishes but great flavor there too. I was surprised though that the clams were in little chopped pieces as oppose to being whole. I was wondering where they were then realized they were about the size of a peppercorn.  Also if you order Kee Mao with shrimp they definitely don't skimp on that. Fried shrimp overload!  I do wish though that there were more veggies overall in their dishes.  Noodlehead has become a staple on my list!",

I ordered the street noodle #2 both times, I would love to try something else but this dish is so delicious I couldn't make myself order another. They put so much shrimp over a generous bed of  thin egg noodles! I've tried it at both spicy level 4 & 5(I LOVE spicy foods). 5 or \"Crazy hot\" was very spicy but quite delicious, however I preferred the \"Thai hot\" flavor of spicy level 4. The atmosphere is great for close conversation. I've read many complaints about the service, but I appreciated that they weren't in my face during the meal. I never felt like I was being rushed, yet they promptly removed dishes when we finished a course.   It is cash only which it states clearly on the menu board outside, on the menu, and I believe even on the door as you enter and with their clear cut menu approximating the cost of your dinner is a breeze.  Seriously try Noodlehead, you wont regret it.",

If you're considering going here, definitely don't think twice! Start with some yummy appetizers (I love the pork belly buns and spring rolls) and then get a heaping plate of noodles (my favs are the Chiang Mai curry/Kee Mao/Pad Thai). I have never been disappointed in their quality, flavor or quantity of food. Prices are super reasonable which is always wonderful. Best part is that they're BYOB and only charge 50cents per person for the \"recycling fee\". Much cheaper than other BYOB places that can charge you up to $15 to bring your own booze?? It's a very popular joint since the food/vibes are awesome so on a weekend I usually avoid arriving between 7-8 and usually only have to wait around 20-30min. They don't take reservations, and they don't have a phone and they only take cash, BUT TRUST ME its worth jumping through all of those hoops for their food!!",

(try at least 1 level higher than you think you can handle)  Cons:  No reservations Entire party must be present before seating Fills up quickly, hard to find a seat No telephone (you have to show up for a take out order and wait) Cash only  The whole \"no reservation\" thing is a bummer, but the food is so good that you pretty much forget about it once you start eating. We had the Sey Yew, Pad Thai, Street Noodles, one of the curries and the pork buns. Everything was delicious, especially the pork buns. Seriously, try the pork buns. They're life changing.   The only issue I had with the food was the spice index. The waiter explained that the 1-5 spice index was generally hotter than most places, and that ordering a 5 was crazy. One of us ordered a 5, and it was more or less like ordering a 7-8 at a regular Thai restaurant , which is a bit mild if you like spicy food. This was a little disappointing, but they had sriracha bottles and pepper flakes at the table, so it was no big deal.  Were it not for the hassle of actually getting to a seat, Noodlehead would deserve all 5 stars. You should still definitely try this place out, just be sure to come 30 minutes earlier than you normally would. It is, however, worth the wait.",

    "text": "I thought of this is a Thai restaurant, but with a limited menu of noodle dishes only. We started with the dumplings and they were okay, but nothing extrude art. I had the Kee Mao with chicken and it was very flavorful, the noodles were large, and boy was it spicy. I would definitely get it again, but lower spice level.  I like some spice and was advised to under-estimate so I went with a 1 on their 0 to 5 scale. However, I'd ask for a 0.5 (if that's an option) or 0 next time so I don't have to drink 5+ glasses of water again.  The restaurant was very full by 6pm on a Friday but we easily got a table at 5:30pm.  We had a few items at the table come out incorrectly but the staff was very friendly and fixed the problem. The food was very reasonably priced and we enjoyed the atmosphere.  Definitely a neat little restaurant to check out!",

    "text": "Holy... wow... sooooo good! I love Thai Place on Walnut down the street too, but Noodlehead is really freaking good!  At first I was bummed there wasn't Tom Kha soup on the menu, but it turns out that it's fine because the Chaing Mai Curry is like Tom Kha soup filled with delicious noodles and oh so freaking delicious!!! I've had the Street Noodle 1 as well and that was pretty dang delicious too. The Thai fried chicken is yummy!  A note on spiciness - I got a 3 and it was quite warm, but still good. I could probably eat a 4 but would be in pain, so I'm guessing that a 5 is way out of my league. This comes from a SoCal native married to an Indian, so I do spice and I do spice well - meaning, they're serious about their spice, but not crazy about it. But don't underestimate it either. (I'm rambling now, I'll skip to the rest...)  I think what's best is that you can tell that they really devote their time to making GOOD food and I think the limited menu helps with that. The dishes are presented well and are not overly oily.  This would be a great early date location as the ambiance is cool, but not too overbearing. And of course, it's super affordable BYOB - so yay wine!",

    "text": "Great casual place to meet up with a friend that's also a BYOB (with a reasonable 50 cents/person corkage fee) so that's also a nice feature if that's your thing.  The food is solid, and you have to select a spice level (from 0-5). I ordered the Kee Mao, and it was spectacular - basil, garlic and soy tasting - perfect flavors, but to me it was a tad salty - then again, I hardly eat salt.    I've had it at 2 spice levels. Let it be known that I like spicy food - but when I ordered it at \"3\" (medium) thinking I was being conservative, it blew me away - mouth burning, and 6 glasses of water throughout the meal. I did not expect this! Needless to say, the next time I got it, I ordered it at a \"1\" (somewhat spicy) spice level...and although I felt like a weakling for my order, this was hot but perfect.  Tip: Go very conservative with the spice level - at least with this dish...and remember to bring cash (this is a \"Cash Only\" place)  Overall, the food is solid, the atmosphere is casual and never rushed, and it's a great place to meet up with just about anyone. The menu is limited, but they seem to do everything well, and the prices are more than reasonable - when I went there, just about every meal was $9 or less. Enjoy!",

On my first visit I had the Chaing curry level 1....it was spicy, but I am a spice wimp. The chicken was moist and the noodles cooked perfect. Today I had Street noodle 1 - Thai fried chicken level 1. Not as spicy as the curry and just as delicious. My better half had the Beef Soup level 3 and didn't think it was spicy enough! Show off! He said everything was cooked very well, but wasn't a fan on the thin noodles.  God help my waste line!",

Last but not the least, I was there for dinner most of the times I visited and I never got the table without waiting for atleast 5 minutes.   Now coming to the food,  my favorites are street noodle 1 and 2. I am a spice level 3 person. I am a fried chicken fan any day. Street noodle 1 has thai fried chicken and it is so tender and delicious. Street noodle 2 has shrimp and it is good too. Menu says tempura shrimp and the last few times, I got normal shrimp, but it is still tasty, so I don't have any complaints about that.   Price here is very reasonable for the quality and quantity of food they provide.

If you like your food with spices, I've got bad news for you: they've cut out some of the more expensive ingredients.  Now \"spicy\" means lots of red chili: no flavor.  No fish sauce, no star anise, no traditional Thai spices.  To many of you who order spice level 0, this won't make much of a difference to you, but you may notice a difference in the quality of your fried chicken or shrimp: rather than the higher quality oil they fried in before, they seem to be using canola oil, Crisco, or something similar.    Noodlehead gets a second star for what they used to be: high quality fusion Thai food.  If they can bring this back, they'll bring back my business: and my positive reviews.",

    "text": "Great, consistent, quick Thai style noodles! My go-to noodle place if I'm in the mood for something tasty and spicy (which is almost always). My favorite dishes are easily the Street Noodle 1, the Chiang Mai Curry, and the Pad See Eew, but just about everything that I've had off the menu has been extraordinary. The fried chicken cutlet on the Street Noodle 1 is 80% of the reason why I order it so often, it's amazingly crispy and juicy, the perfect accompaniment to the spicy, saucy, rice noodles. My favorite part about the Pad See Eew is they actually a few noodles with the wok flame which caramelizes a bit of the sauce right onto the noodles. This technique elevates the dish to the next level and is about as authentic as it gets. My newfound favorite, the Chiang Mai Curry, is a Panang red curry bottomed out with egg noodles, chicken, and topped with a crispy egg noodle nest. The flavors are incredible and will leave you happy and full each time. The crispy egg noodle nest is my favorite part since the texture contrast with the rest of the dish will keep you coming back for more.  Their spice scale is on a 1-5 but they don't mess around with the heat - 5 never looked so intimidating. However, I'll typically get a 3/5 if I want to enjoy the spice, 4/5 if I want to feel alive, and a 5/5 if I want to sweat it out at the table and make others think I just finished a 5K.   As others have mentioned, Noodlehead does not have a phone, so you have to place take out orders in person, but you won't be waiting any longer than 15 minutes for your food despite how busy they are. They are also a cash only establishment, but there is an ATM located inside for your convenience, and they do not take reservations. On weekends, be prepared to wait in a long queue during peak hours, but the wait is definitely worth it. Despite these minor inconveniences, the food speaks for itself and Noodlehead has become a Thai noodle titan in the heart of Shadyside, and mine.",

    "text": "This is my 2nd time here (a year apart) and I am ready to review! My sister raves about this place for its prices and quality. First off you can't beat the price nothing is over $9!! Don't forget your cash either because it's cash only. Want to make reservations or call for take out? Don't. Because they don't have a phone! lol I think this is what helps keep their price so low. On a Saturday night near gentrified east liberty, this is a nesting place for 20-30 somethings with their BYOBs in hand. Just remember there is a .50 recycling fee per person if you do. We had 5 people and the wait was 30 minutes which wasn't bad. It seemed like people came in waves so it's a luck thing. Btw make sure your whole party is there or forget being seated  We got a nice big table in the center and our waitress was helpful with our questions. The authenticity of the food seemed better than other places. Especially with the heat index. I usually get a 5 but here I got a 2. I usually get fresh spring rolls for appetizer but they only have that in the summer. I am not a fan of the fried ones not because they don't taste good but because I like fresh things :-)  Very simple menu: which makes it easier to pick. I got the chiang mang curry at a level 2. Perfect level of spiciness for an experienced Thai eater. It has a little hint of sweetness as well. People say the portions are huge but I didn't think so. It was perfect. But I can eat ,so it just depends on your appetite. My friend opted for a 3 against the waitress recommendation and she was dying lol so don't get cocky here because the food is pretty spicy.  If you are with 5 or more they add gratuity, and they don't do separate checks. This is always a stop when I visit Pittsburgh.",

I wouldn't say its the most authentic food but it tastes good, and hey thats good enough for me. Prices are fairly cheap but I do feel like they could have slightly bigger portions. I also love coming here and then after going into Millies, the ice cream shop, next door! Definitely recommend if your looking for a low key lunch or dinner.",

We were seated at a picnic like table and our server was very helpful with our questions. It's also BYOB and you only have to pay 50 cents per person for recycling. We ending up bringing 5 bottles!   I started with the crispy vegetable spring rolls. They were very good and weren't greasy.  I ended up getting the Green Curry Linguine spice level 3. The hostess suggested I get a 2 but I was happy with my decision. I got a little hot and teary eyed at one point but I love spicy! I couldn't image what 4 and 5 would be like. But I hate when you go places and get a high number and it doesn't even do anything for you. This place is not like that!   I'll be returning. There were so many other things I wanted to try!",

    "text": "We are a visitor to Pittsburgh and Noodlehead was highly recommended on the web and we were glad we paid them a visit! The dishes were inspired by the street food of Thailand and as the name suggests, the highlight of the menu are noodles, Thai noodles!   There was a queue when we arrived around 6pm in the evening but the wait was not long as the service was efficient and the line moved quickly.  We ordered Chiang Mai Curry, See Yew and Street Noodle 1. The highlight was definitely the Chiang Mai Curry which had deep fried noodles which looked great and added texture to the dish. When you dip the crunchy noodles into the curry, it softens and biting into it, depending on on much and how long you dip into it, there will be portions of it soft and portions crunchy. Being deep friend, the noodles are extra flavorful, so adding the curry, this dish simply pops!   The other two dishes were both good, but the flavors were quite similar, only with different vegetables and noodles, so just go with whichever kind of noodles you prefer. This would be True on the streets of Thailand as well.  The restaurant is clean and spacious, the ambience cozy, warm and chic, and the staff were friendly and efficient.   Overall, great experience and food!",

Some things to note for first timers: 1. It is a very popular place so expect wait times for busier hours/days (there are no reservations) 2. It's BYOB so bring alcohol if you want to drink, water is provided and other beverages like soda and tea can be bought. 3. It is cash only so make sure you have enough to cover the bill (usually around 20-40 for two people). An ATM is available in the resturaunt but will charge a fee. 4. The spicy levels are VERY spicy, I consider myself someone who prefers spicy food and I usually only go with a 1 on the spicy scale (out of 5).  The food is amazing here and you won't regret going at all. The stipulations I posted above can get annoying at times but you have to respect it. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend and I have!",

Also, there doesn't seem to be much variation in flavor between the noodle dishes. They use a lot of the same ingredients. All in all, it's good, but it wouldn't be my first pick for authentic thai food.  It's worth noting that they are cash only, but there is an ATM in the back of the restuarant.",

We chose a table and moments after we sat down the girl came over with an attitude and stated that we needed to sit at a table for two because they save the table for bigger parties. The table we sat down at was a table for four instead of a table for two. It wouldn't have bothered me so much if she had just seated us at a table. I did not appreciate her attitude.",

    "text": "Finally got to give this place a try! We arrived on a Sunday night around 6:30, and the place was packed. Despite there being several parties ahead of us, the wait was no more than 20 minutes. Corkage fee is only 50 cents per person, so a bottle of wine (or beer) is a steal.   We ordered the vegetable spring rolls and pork belly buns to start. Both were pretty good, but the pork buns fell short of expectations.   For our entrees, we ordered the street noodles and chicken pad Thai, both at spice level 1. The pad Thai was a good spice level, but the street noodles packed much more heat. This was probably because all of the sauce fell to the bottom of the dish, rather than on the noodles. The Thai fried rice in the street noodles was phenomenal though!  All in all, a decent first time at Noodlehead. Expect to wait, BYOB, and beware of the spice levels.",

We tried the See Yew with big, soft rice noodles, a very tasty sweet sauce, and your choice of shrimp or chicken. The flavor was fantastic and very distinguished. The other dish was Chiang Mai Curry with egg noodles, chicken, and some vegetables in a superb coconut sauce. The portions were decently sized and will fill you (if you're super hungry take a starter). The spiciness level ranges from 1 to 5 - I took 2 and it was already well spiced. Prices are okay-ish, $9 for a main dish. The food quality is great though and that's why I'll definitely come back here again.  Street parking can be tough on South Highland and - it's cash only.",

The fresh rolls are pretty good too. I've had the pad thai and the kee mao noodles ($9 each) which I absolutely loved. You can change the spice level, so no need to fear. I have a relatively high tolerance for spice, but I'll still only get a 3 or 4. The Kee Mao already has a spicy garlic in it, so the 3 still gives you enough of a kick.",

This place had been on our bookmarks list for a long time and the day we finally went there we were headed for a long wait. However once we got a table service was pretty fast.  This place has no booze and they charge 50 cents per person and allow you to bring your own booze. There's a beer store right next to this place which we didn't know about so we just spent 30min in queue waiting and getting bored.  Once seated we ordered pork dumplings that were served almost immediately. There were 4 in a plate and they tasted fine. We also ordered pad see ew with chicken and green curry linguine with clams. They made it really spicy as we had asked for and it was quite fun. The quantity of food they served was quite large compared to how much they charge. The see ew tasted good. The green curry linguine had a lot of curry and was pretty heavy. However I was really put off when I found little pieces of clam shell in my food. I didn't complain and create unnecessary delay as a lot of people were waiting and the servers were really busy.  This place is great value for money however you have to pay in cash(like so many other places in Pittsburgh). They have an ATM too in case you're not carrying enough with you. They also don't let you modify / customize your order except for spice level. My vegetarian friends seem to like noodle head quite a bit.",

I typically love the Chiang Mai noodles here, but last time I was here I found them to be underwhelming. The chicken was not super fresh (taste like it hadn't fully thawed from being frozen) and the dish was a little salty for my tastes.  In the past, I have also enjoyed the Sukothai, Love Boat, Beef Soup, and Pad Thai here before and thought they were all decent.  I hope that my latest Chiang Mai experience was a fluke, because there are many other great aspects of Noodlehead. One of the main features is that the prices are totally reasonable ($9 for a big portion).  The atmosphere is nice as well.  It's super roomy and spacious, and the decor is a mix of elegant and modern and eclectic.  There's a kind of nature-y theme with lots of wood and plants, some eclectic lights and furnishings.  Service has always been at least satisfactory, and often above-and-beyond.  Remember they are cash only, BYOB, and don't serve dessert.  But their corkage (\"recycling\") fee is only 50 cents!",

I moved to Pittsburgh from San Francisco and Noodlehead is one of the few restaurants in this city that remind me of restaurants in SF. The pork buns are amazing- I'm constantly craving them. I've been happy with everything that I've ordered but am especially partial to the Sukothai, Street Noodle #1, and Kee Mao. Plus, it's BYOB so a whole evening out here is really affordable. The only downside is that they don't have a phone number listed so you can't call ahead and do take-out or ask about the wait.

I've gone to other places in Pittsburgh and ordered a dish with 10/10 spice to end up pouring siracha all over it anyway because it was so weak.

Love the pork buns and pig wings- both are bites of fatty porky deliciousness. The street noodle one has the most crispy chicken that is just so good. Also love the see ew and kee mao. Byob and cash only so come prepared.",

The steam buns were definitely my favorite part, but the curry and pad see ew were just ok compared to other thai places in Pittsburgh. I did like the spice level. I love spicy food and a 3 on the 1-5 scale was good for me, if not a tiny bit too hot.   The seating is pretty horrible. None of the chairs have backs, and it's really uncomfortable.",

Cash only, reasonably priced on portions - in most cases enough food for leftovers for a lunch the following day.   We have had all the dishes on the menu - both street noodles are great, but my favorite is the pad thai.   With it being BYOB, you can stop at the wine and spirits right around the corner and pick out a bottle for your date or group.

Knowing that Noodlehead has a BYOB policy (with only a .50 cork fee), we brought a nice bottle of wine to celebrate friendship and Thai goodness. I ordered the See Yew noodles, which were very good. The portions were not too big, yet not too small. The inside of the restaurant (which I believe had been renovated within the last 5 years) was incredible, plus the service was great. Being Thai cuisine, the menu was very vegetarian friendly, so I would recommend this place even more so for vegetarians. I really enjoyed my experience here, so I will definitely stop in again soon!",

The crispy veggie spring rolls were just your garden variety greasy egg roll. Will try the fresh garden roll next time. The noodles were just good, nothing super special. We found out they don't even make them in house, which was quite a letdown. I will try it again b/c there are other things on the menu that are intriguing. If I'm not more impressed next time then I would just go for the pork buns. Also we went around 4 pm on a Saturday so there was no wait. I certainly would not stand in line for this one.",

Rich, flavorful with the perfect balance of sauce and crunch. The bread was fluffy and the pork incredibly tender. Next came our noodle dishes - green curry for my date, tofu pad thai for me. Delicious, we finished it all, along with the bottle of red wine we brought. Yes this place is BYOB and cash only. But this in no way impedes them from filling tables and sending full, happy diners on their way.   Service was fast and polite. Food was hot and came quickly.  Well worth the reasonable prices.

I've heard plenty about Noodlehead, but I usually stick with Nicky's, so this was my first visit to the industrial rustic chic eatery. I couldn't decide between the Kee Mao and the See Ew, so I asked the server to break the tie and opted with her recommendation of Kee Mao, spice level 3. My entree came quickly in the midst of the lunch rush. It was delectable!  The texture of the noodles was so satisfying, the taste of basil was in every bite. The sauce had a sweetness that balanced well with my intermediate spice level, not sure if I'd like it with a lower spice level. I had a can of sparkling wine, but a lighter red like Pinot noir or Beaujolais would be perfect with this dish. I look forward to working my way through the menu!",

In terms of Thai noodle dishes, he's only had the privilege of trying my sad homemade Pad Thai. Needless to say, he was blown away with his Pad Thai dish at Noodlehead! I love the Street Noodle #2 which is a little lighter and tangier than Pad Thai. It's one of my favorite dishes. I also love that Sriracha sauce lives in each table.

Overall, a solid meal at a reasonable prices, but the line can get long and with the lack of phone service or credit card, getting any kind of meal, to-go or dine-in, can be quite the wait.  Things I ordered: - pork buns are absolutely delicious! They're sweet and savory, the bun is like chewing a cloud, and the sauces are rich, creamy, and blend well with all the ingredients. -street noodle number 1: everything is delicious; noodles have a good chewiness and are not soggy. Only thing I didn't like is that the chicken is unremarkable for \"thai fried chicken\" -street noodle number 2: again, everything about it is very good. Sauce is not overpowering, but the \"tempura shrimp\" reminds and tastes like something from the frozen foods section of a grocery store (but still yummy!) -kee mao: noodles again well-cooked, sauce is well-balanced. I really enjoy the basil flavor in this dish -see yew: again, a well-balanced dish with strong basil flavor. -pad thai: I did not enjoy this dish. For me noodles were a hit or miss. Flavor could be more developed e.g. perhaps a more complex peanut sauce, something more savory thrown in. Overall unmemorable pad thai dish.  Things I liked: -overall food is delicious (see above paragraph)  Things I didn't like: -no phone service -very loud environment. Often times I could not hear my dinner partner, but at least I can enjoy the meal! I personally would not recommend this place for a dinner date unless you go during a low demand hour or really just want the food and don't want to eat alone. But beware because it's- -cash only",

Limited style menu with no substitutions makes for consistency and less mistakes.   My selection was street noodles #1 with heat of #1: my Thai style chicken was a bit over cooked and it had strong fish taste, so strong I did not think it was chicken. Small disappointment. The noodles and sauce were delicious. Maybe a bit too much fish sauce there as well. But I loved the all over flavor and heat. Just a small hint of heat. Perfect. My husband ordered street noodles #2 with heat #1. His was a bit more spicier than mine. The shrimp-meh...  small tempura shrimp-over cooked. Noodles were great with sauce.    Atmosphere: quaintly dark modern.   I dined at lunch. Doors open at noon. I got there 1:00. They were at almost at max capacity. We got a small two seat in the front corner near the window. Perfect seat. Definitely best seat in the place. Anyhow, they were busy. They handle busy well. Waitress was very calm and professional. Our order came out promptly. Hot. Fresh.

We ordered the Sweet & Spicy Pig Wings and the Chiang Mai Curry. I wasn't a huge fan of the wings, but the curry more than made up for it. The wings were just not nearly as good value as the curry which was much more substantial and only cost a little bit more.  I love all things coconut, so it was no surprise that I was obsessed with the yellow curry coconut milk sauce. My only issue with the Chiang Mai was that it was a little messy to eat. As hard as I tried, I simply could not avoid getting little splash marks all over my shirt (and my GF had the same problem). Anyway, the deliciousness was easily worth the extra laundry.",

I really enjoyed his sauce more so I would order that one next time. As long as you like Thai food you can't go wrong. They have a 0-5 spicy scale which is nice because I prefer a 0-1 while I know most people enjoy more heat. I recommend going low because they will bring more spice to your table if you request it. The serving size was large- I was able to make two meals out of it. I did feel it was a little lacking in veggies, I would've like to see more than 4 spears of broccoli with my dish. We will definitely be back on a night we want a delicious meal without spending a ton of money.",

I always got the Chiang Mai Curry, the Pork Steam Buns, the Beef Soup, and the Love Boat. However, I noticed that for about a year now the food quality has gone WAY down. Not only are spice levels inconsistent (I always order \"2,\" but on some days it tastes like a 4 and on other days tastes like 0), but the quality of the ingredients (beef and chicken) have gotten worse as well. Sometimes, my food is too salty and other times too bland. I've noticed this to be especially True for the Chiang Mai Curry, which used to be my favorite dish from them but now tastes like noodles in sauce. It's no longer creamy and rich and covered with bean sprouts; rather, watered down curry with very few bean sprouts to garnish.  I don't think I'll be coming back anymore. Good thing I'm done with grad school in two more months.",

    "text": "I've tried everything on their menu and literally everything is dreamworthy.  However, their See ew and the green curry linguine are my absolute favorites.  Theyre pretty much just amazing flavor explosions in my mouth and yet it's never too much.  I always have to bring friends so we can get different plates and share them all because I can never decide what I want!    One time my boyfriend and I ordered three entrees and porkbuns and managed to eat everything. Have to admit we both had extreme food comas after.  The atmosphere is fantastic- It's comfortable and could suit just about any situation whether you're on a date or a fancy meeting, a fun night out or just a casual dinner with friends.    The service can be a little slow, but it is awfully busy so it's understandable.  Its not slow enough for me to ever complain. (and the food is soooo worth the wait). I love siting on the bar along the window- so fun for people watching!  It is cash only, but everything is extremely well priced, so its great!  I only have two gripes: I wish their spicy levels were more extreme!  I've ordered things with 5 (their most spicy level) and it'd be around a 3 at any thai restaurant.  It's unexpected because their dishes have such a perfect balance of every other flavor.  They dont have a phone!  My friend left a bag their once and instead of just calling to check if it was there, we had to bus alll the way back the next day to see if it was still there.  but otherwise...BEST NOODLES IN PITTSBURGH.

    "text": "Based on all the great reviews about Noodlehead, I was pretty psyched to go there this past weekend. Unfortunately, that excitement pretty much disappeared as soon as I walked in the door.  First off, cash only. Not a deal-breaker, by any means, but it would be helpful if they had prevalent signs stating so. The only mention of cash-only that I saw was on the menu. By the time you see the menu, you're already in the door and making an exit to hit up an ATM is awkward. (To be fair, I've since heard that there's an ATM on-site... but if you want to avoid ATM surcharges, I'd suggest stopping at your bank's ATM before you arrive).  Second, I am a party of 1. There was a party of 3 in front of me and 2 behind me. I stood there, waiting my turn to get seated as the hostess completely overlooked me and asked the people behind me if they were a party of 3 as well (assuming I was with them). Once I made it clear I was there by myself, the hostess seemed confused and then walked away. A few minutes later, she seated the 3-top in front of me. After that she mentioned in passing that I could sit at the counter that overlooks S Highland, and then proceeded to seat the people behind me. I should mention that all of the seats at the counter were open the entire time; she could have asked me to have a seat there when she asked if I was part of the group of people behind me. It also bugs me a little that she never asked if I wanted a table seat in the actual restaurant instead of at the counter. I guess single diners don't get the same options as couples.  Once I had finally seated myself, the server came over with water and handed me the small menu. After a few minutes, I'd made my decision: Street Noodles #1. The server came back in a reasonable amount of time to take my order, but barely even spoke to me - he handed me my water and menu without speaking and then when it was time to order, came over and simply asked, \"Are you ready?\" I was not offered any other drinks, and the server never suggested any apps. Basically, the only words he spoke to me the entire time I was there were \"Are you ready?\" And, while I'm on the subject of the server, one piece of advice from a server/bartender - give your servers some substantial paper to use to take orders. The guy who waited on me fumbled around trying to find the world's tiniest post-it note so that he could write down my order. Maybe less time spent fumbling about for paper would yield better customer service?  To the restaurant's credit, the food arrived quickly, and the chicken in the Street Noodles #1 was very good. Moist on the inside, crispy on the outside. The noodles, though... maybe I was just too into the chicken to even notice the noodles in this dish. I saw maybe 2 forkfuls of noodles, swimming in a runny sauce below the chicken. So for all you people who keep saying Noodlehead is a great value, what on earth are you ordering? Because the meal I paid $9 for was worth, in my estimate, at most $5. I left the restaurant still very hungry since the meal consisted almost exclusively of a chicken breast and sauce. Though, to be fair, the chicken was the highlight of the trip. Did I just order the wrong thing? Who knows.  I should also mention, the restaurant was not very busy - it was 6:00 or 7:00 on a Sunday night - but no one came over, not even once, to see how my meal was. The only time I saw my server after he dropped my food off and ran was when he came to take the dish away (didn't ask if it was good or bad or if I needed anything else) and dropped off the bill before walking away again.   I came into Noodlehead happy and excited to try a new place, but I left feeling disappointed, hungry, and with the distinct feeling that my existence was a nuisance to my server. I don't think I'll bother returning.",

While it took a bit to adjust to the unique seating situation once we found a spot we quickly got to work figuring out what all we wanted to try.  My dining companions decided to share the steamed pork rolls - which were apparently phenomenal - while I went straight for the main entree. While I was saddened by the lack of vegetarian options under snacks the dinner options make up for that as you can pick between shrimp, chicken, or tofu.  I decided to go for the Kee Mao as I'm on a bit of a bok choy blitz and decided to go midway spice wise.  WOW did this dish have heat!  From the first bite I was smitten - this is how spicy food should taste, not overpowering tongue on fire but gradual and building so that you can savor the dish.  The bok choy was cooked perfectly, greens and whites, as were the noodles creating the perfect combination of crunch and slurp.   The portion was also on the large size which was a pleasant surprise given how affodable this place is.   I can't wait to visit Pittsburgh again and will most certainly be heading back to Noodlehead.  Fingers crossed they will add some more vegetarian options to the menu or at least be willing to accomodate minor subs as I would love to try the Chiang Mai Curry!",

For our main dishes, we had the chiang mai curry (spicy level 3), kee mao (spicy level 2), and the love boat (spicy level 2). Again, all three were delicious, although the spiciness level of the chiang mai curry didn't seem to compare with the other two dishes, even though we ordered it with a hotter spiciness level.  So, why the 1 star review? Half way through our meal, one of my dining companions found a paper clip in the chiang mai curry. The response we received when we reported the paper clip to the staff? Nope, not a \"We're sorry because that's really disgusting and you could've choked on that,\" but rather \"That's funny because we don't have any paper clips in the kitchen.\" What a ridiculous and unnecessary comment! As if we carry paper clips in our pocket to put in our food to avoid paying for a frickin' $9 bowl of noodles! The dish ended up being removed from our bill, but the accusatory tone the Noodlehead staff took left a very poor taste in our mouths.  Bottom line: Good food. Disgustingly poor customer service. It's really a shame.",

    "text": "Took my girlfriend there for a little date night this past Friday. The prices are very easy on the wallet. For those who don't know, this is a Thai restaurant. I ordered the Street Noodle #1 and my girlfriend had the Pad Thai. I was actually surprised at how well it tasted for the price. My date enjoyed her Pad Thai. The food is very good though their menu isn't as versatile as say, Thai Cuisine in Bloomfield or Nicky's Thai Kitchen on the North Side. For the price though, Noodlehead is an absolute deal. The restaurant has a trendy feel to it. It is cash only so beware. I had to hit the ATM in the rain. It is also BYOB. They only charge .50cents a person so that's pretty cheap, in line with their menu prices. Overall, the food was tasty, the bill was cheap so there's not too much to complain about at all. Perfect for a cheap date night. I do feel that if you're looking for dining experience to taste the best Thai food around, one of the other 2 options I mentioned will be better...but more expensive.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnoodleheadpgh.com%2F&s=4e0c8ecd57623d88c8e1003f5153ac88c6a892fbabb555d891fa79ddef280939\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">noodleheadpgh.com</a>",

We were a little surprised that they did not have any hot beverages (coffee house is right next door if it's a cold day) or the standard soft drinks, but at the end of the day water is best for you, so maybe we should give them credit for keeping us away from all that caffeine.  We started with the garlic chicken wings and shared chicken pad thai and chiang mai curry.  We both like a little spice and ordered our entrees at 3 (1- no spice ; 5 - crazy hot) and both were prepared just right.  Quantities were more than adequate but not glutinous.  This is a really nice Thai experience that's worth a visit if you're roaming near Shadyside.",

Then there are the pork steam buns--if noodlehead would cater, I would have them delivered to me all day, every day. I would have those steam buns served at my wedding. There is something about the sauce that is so tangy and rich, and the fat is cut perfectly with a single slice of pickle. The meat is always tender and flavorful, but I always give it a kick with a squirt of Sriracha.   Another winning dish is the sukothai. The broth is filled with aromatics and I get it really spicy so it clears out my sinuses. I know this sounds weird, but whenever I have a cold, my prescription is for sukothai because it makes me feel so much better. And that's just the broth. The meat balls, noodles, veggies, and crunchy wonton strips are just delicious bonuses!  Downsides: Noodlehead does not have a phone, so you cannot call in takeout orders or make reservations. If you are meeting people, you will not be sat until your entire party arrives, which can be very annoying.   All of that aside, though, the service is always great and quick. I have very few complaints about anything noodlehead does. This place is one of my all-time favorites!",

There's a wine and spirits a few steps away from this place, which is convenient if you forget your drinks/have a change of heart. There's usually always a wait, as they don't take reservations, but the wait is definitely worth it.   My go-to order is the Chiang Mai, which is a mix of crunchy and soft noodles, and the curry complements both noodles very well. If you get this dish for takeout (they don't do delivery!), they make sure to bag the crunchy noodles instead of putting them in the dish to avoid them getting soggy. The street noodle #1 and #2 are also very good, and I'm told the pad thai is also delicious. You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, there's something here for everyone (including tofu options as well!).   Cash only, but there's an ATM in the back. If you still have room for dessert, stop by Millie's ice cream, which is right next door!",

On busier nights there definitely is a wait, but it's never been unmanageable.      On my most recent visit, I had the See Yew. It's to die for. My sister got the love boat, which was a rich, spicy noodle soup with great flavor. In past occasions, I've had street noodle #1, street noodle #2, and the Chiang Mai Curry. They are all super delicious and amazing. I usually leave Noodlehead with a small container of leftovers due to the large proportions you get.     Appetizer/snack wise, I've tried the Pork Bao Buns and most recently the Thai Fried Chicken. The Thai Fried Chicken melts in your mouth. The serving was a very good size to share. The Bao Buns are also delicious and come in a pair -- perfect for sharing as well.      Overall, I definitely recommend Noodlehead. It's got amazing food and the ambiance inside is quite nice as well. I'm already planning my next visit.",

My food was delivered to my table in the less then 10 minutes.  The spice scale at noodle head is on the spicier side. Are usually enjoy your five at most Thai restaurants,  but noodle head only has one through five. I go with it too and if it's not hot enough I add flakes onto it which are provided at the table.

    "text": "Noodlehead is always busy, and for good reason. The food is reasonably priced and delicious street style Thai food. The service is accommodating and friendly, albeit overwhelmed so it took a while to get the check. The food came super fast! I ordered a Love Boat as an appetizer which is very flavorful and highly recommended. Basil and cilantro work well with the beef broth which had lots of savory flavors and the medium spice level was perfect. I had the tempura shrimp with thin rice noodles (street noodle #2) and it was very good also. The sauce was slightly sweet which was unexpected. The batter on the shrimp was light and crispy. Onto the next entree, the Kee Mao with shrimp was rich and delicious also. Large rice noodles, bok choy, nappa cabbage, basil, and chili garlic sauce combined to make a dish reminiscent of lo mein flavors. It had a great earthy quality to it presumably from a hoisin or fish sauce. It is BYOB, and a 50 cent charge at that per person which is very reasonable. An eclectic variety of sodas round out the drink selection including Mexican sodas and Red Ribbon offerings. As this establishment is cash only, come prepared. A usual wait is around an hour, so have a walk around the neighborhood before enjoying all the fine offerings from Noodlehead. You won't be dissapointed!",

The tables around us were all full. Great atmosphere for catching up with friends or for a casual date night.  + Lovely service. Our waitress was around at very appropriate times and always attentive to what we needed.  +/- Menu is somewhat limited, but it also makes it easier to pick. + Super tasty Thai food. My friend and I loved the pork buns! Perfect textures and flavors. Pay attention to the spice scale, and you'll love your main dishes too. - Cash only, so be prepared.

    "text": "Like Amanda J., I wouldn't call myself a huge Thai food aficionado.  Having said that, I've tried several of the standby Thai food eateries around PGH, so I have a decent standard of comparison.  While Noodlehead is quite different than many run-of-the-mill Thai places in terms of atmosphere and style of food served, IMO, it ties Nicky's for best Thai restaurant in PGH.  I visited with a friend for the first time the Fri. before last.  Despite not accepting reservations or having a phone, they're on NoWait.  I didn't realize this until we arrived and it was too late (I should be in the habit of checking by now), but even so, we only ended up waiting about 20 min. for a table.  When we were seated, it was at one of the back tables, which are communal and picnic style--fine for us, but something that might not be ideal for a date.  Also, as another reviewer mentioned, it was rather chilly where we were seated.  As an appetizer, we ordered the steamed pork buns ($6) to share.  They were super flavorful and delicious, reminding us of BBQ pulled pork (we're BBQ aficionados) with a soft, foldable bun.  For our entrees, I ordered the street noodle #1 with Thai fried chicken, and my friend ordered the Chiang Mai curry ($9 each).  Given that spice levels here run from 1-5, I went with a 2 and my friend went with a 3, which were perfect for our tastes.  While I'm not exactly sure what defines fried chicken as Thai per se (seasoning, perhaps?), it was deliciously crispy and moist, as well-made fried chicken should be.  The noodles, which were of the thin variety, soaked up the sauce, which was mouthwateringly savory and piquant.  While I can't speak for the Chiang Mai curry myself, it's one of my friend's favorite dishes to order here due to the richness of the sauce and the crispy lo mein noodle topping.  Needless to say, we were quite impressed with our meal at Noodlehead.  The only drawbacks concern matters other than the food, i.e. (1) the wait; (2) the ambient temperature; and (3) the cash only policy (not a huge deal for me, but a consideration for many, incl. my friend).  If you're looking for Thai food that's slightly edgy but not super pretentious, quality food on a budget, or are in the area, give Noodlehead a try--I daresay it won't disappoint!",

However, after about 10 minutes we were offered a spot at the window bar and we grabbed it! Here's our overall experience:   Food:       Pulled Pork Belly Steamed Buns [$6 for 2] are amazing, a MUST eat if you come here. The tasty pork is dripping with delicious juices and are topped with cucumber and some cilantro. They are neatly sandwiched between a soft and fluffy white steamed bun.  Street Noodle #1 [$9 for a huge portion] at a level \"2\" spicy was pretty good, but it brought me to the edge of my spice tolerance! If you have low spice tolerance, I would recommend ordering either level 0 or 1! On the beverage side, they also have Mexican Cola, Sprite, and Fanta and a BYOB option.   Service:      Amazing, 10 out of 10. The waiter was attentive and timely! He kept an eye on my iced tea and noticed before I did that it was low and refilled it! My dining companion ordered See Yew [$9] with the Thai Fried Chicken instead of just normal chicken [+$2] but when it came out, it had normal chicken. As soon as we told the waiter, he apologized and gave us a side order of the Thai Fried Chicken with no extra charge. Don't forget this place is cash only though, that's the only thing that bothered me.   Atmosphere:       Casual and chic, there was a rustic feel for the place as the counters and tables were all wood and were paired with metal chairs. The music wasn't too loud that I couldn't have a conversation, and happily it wasn't the Top 40 playlist :)   Great place for families or a intimate date! I'm definitely coming back.",

We were seated (your entire party needs to be there) at one of the larger tables. It's BYOB and all of my girls had some wine. Noodlehead provided wine glasses. All of us had screw off bottles so, we didn't need anything opened for us. There's no cork fee, just a 50 cent recycling fee. That's pretty awesome and environmentally friendly.   Our waitress came to the table immediately to help us out. I ordered pad Thai, at spice level two. They ask you your spice level from 1-5. If you like spicy stuff, a 2 is pretty spicy. My friend ordered something that was a 3, and was crying at the table. You can also get a 0 spice level. Just be aware that you want to taste your food.   I also got the veggie egg rolls. An order comes with two of them. They have a sauce on the side that's really sweet.    Everything came out great and wonderful and quick. The portions were a great size and I really enjoyed how busy the restaurant was. It made you feel like you were in the right place on a Saturday night. Be sure to check it out. It's really inexpensive, and the food + service are just top notch.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, and the prices are very reasonable. At $9 for each huge plate of food, it's a steal.  The noodles and the appetizers are amazing. My favorites are the Chicken Kee Mao, the See Yew noodles, and the pork buns. They are the best items on the menu. The Chicken Pad Thai is a very safe and delicious option as well.  The service isn't great. They tend to forget to bring more water and take a long time to seat you, bring you the food, and take your order. One of the waitresses won't wait more than ten seconds for you to decide what you want to order -- she'll just tell you to take your time to decide and comes back ten minutes later. But given the nice ambiance and the fact that I'm only paying $9, I can take it.  If you're planning on coming here, remember to bring your wallet! This place is cash only.",

Secondly, the restaurant is cash only but has an ATM in it so it wasn't that inconvenient. Thirdly I think the noodles are really amazing, I ordered the street noodle number 2 with fried shrimps and thin noodle (the yellow egg noodle, like the materials in the wonton noodle - a Hong Kong traditional dish). My bf did the wide noodle with baby boo choi and basil and chose level 2 spicy - we were really surprised by how spicy it is for only level 2!! It was really spicy - I wonder if the chef put in too much hot chili pepper or it's actually this spicy - I would suggest eating #1 spicy if you do not have a high tolerance of spicy food. I did the mint ginger ale as well it tastes really cool (like a toothpaste flavor). Overall I think this place is really good and dynamic but you gotta watch the spicy level!!!",

    "text": "Probably the best Thai food in Pittsburgh. The menu is limited, but all items on it are delicious and come at a very reasonable price. Firstly, a visit to Noodlehead is incomplete without ordering some of their pork buns. I've tried pork bao buns at a number of restaurants in many different cities and none compare to the ones at Noodlehead. The pork and sauce create a perfect balance of savory and sweet, the cucumber adds a nice crunch, and the soft bun completes the magical experience. My favorite meal items are the Chang mai curry which has a creamy and flavorful sauce, and the beef soup. The street noodles with the fried chicken are also very good, as is the pad Thai.  To those complaining about how busy it can be, it's that way for a reason and I promise it's worth the experience. Wait staff has always been friendly and the food always comes out in a very timely manner even when it's packed.",

Some notes, it does get crowded and you may have to wait, so plan accordingly. They are also BYOB and there is only a .50 recycle fee. Wine is so expensive in restaurants, this allows you to bring your own bottle and with the food being so reasonably priced makes this a very affordable meal.

The menu and the website both call this out so I was at least forewarned. No parking either. That is a bit of a problem but we drove around a few side streets before finding an alley.   Okay, so the quality of the food. A+! I ordered the Street Noodle #2 and the hubby ordered the Chang Mai Curry. The street noodles were the exact textured Hong Kong style thin egg noodles that I crave 24/7. The sauce and the tempura shrimp were perfect too. I got the 0 spicy level but had them bring the chili flakes on the side. That's how I roll. I like to control my own spice level. The portion of mine was rather small for $9. I agree with some of the other reviewers that they should throw in more noodles b/c I started eyeing my husband's dish...  The atmosphere was crowded but hip. The tables were super clean and not wobbly. I would definitely come back here to try the other menu items. It's comparable to Lulu's Noodles from the Carnegie Mellon area but there are many things I like about Lulu's more, I think.",

Rather than sit so close we opted for take out (be warned they don't have phones so you have to in person put in your order).   They are happy to substitute any meat noodle with tofu (just watch out for the type of broth). We loved the Chiang Mai curry noodle with tofu and Mr. Jessica ordered the see yew with shrimp. We order 1/5 spicy to get a bit of spice and flavor but not to be overwhelmed.  Their service was blistering fast on a packed night. We waited less than 10 mins between ordering and walking out the door with our fresh hot food.  They are consistent and fast and a good noodle fix.",

    "text": "This is not authentic Thai food whatsoever. Do not go to Noodlehead expecting your standard Thai restaurant (by American standards). Not a single Thai person seems to work there - it's mostly very trendy and hip young Americans. This vibes will with the trendy aesthetic of the restaurant.   Go into Noodlehead expecting Thai/Asian INSPIRED noodle dishes, and you will be able to enjoy it. The Pad See Ew is my favorite. I am disappointed recently by Noodlehead's removal of the fresh spring rolls that you would find at any thai restaurant from their menu. You can only get fried spring rolls now. I also felt surprised by the thick breading that came on the chicken in the street noodle dishes - unappetizing, heavy, and the breading was so thick that it would fall off the chicken far too easily. It also just is not what one typically expects when ordering chicken in a noodle dish (so be wary that it comes thickly breaded!).   I wouldn't go out of my way to go to Noodlehead because the menu selection is so small (there's maybe 12 menu items, and that inclues appetizers, soups, and entree noodle dishes). Also, it's terribly inconvenient for the following reasons to be aware of:  You cannot use credit cards (though there is an ATM with a $3.00 fee inside). You cannot make reservations(there is not even a phone to call them on). You cannot order delivery, or place an order before arriving (again, no phone). You cannot even put your name on a list to be seated until every member of your party is present (very annoying when you're friend is trying to find parking on a crowded city street). It is BYOB, but there is a corking fee.  Basically, Noodlehead is a pain to deal with (waiting in long lines, trying to get your name in and getting frustrated that last party member can't park fast enough and the list grows right in front of your eyes, paying to drink the alcohol you already bought, and having few options to choose from and likely not seeing your favorite Thai classics if you like to branch out from pad thai) BUT, if you're interested in an aesthetically pleasing environment to eat some noodles, it's the place.",

We ordered pork dumplings to share, I got Street Noodle #2 at spicy level 1, and my friend ordered the Sukhothai at spicy level 2. There were four pork dumplings per order. They put a fun twist on them and they looked a bit more like shaomai. However, I wished the filling was more flavorful; I found it overly meaty. The Street Noodle #2 was delicious. You could taste the stir-fry and garlic in the noodles, the shrimp were delightfully crsipy, and the spice level was perfect for me. My friend also enjoyed her Sukhothai, though she  found the spice a little much. All in all, it was a delicious meal. My friend and I agreed that we have to return to try other menu items--they all looked so good!  The service was very prompt. Our waiter was friendly and attentive, but he always seemed rushed (understandably) and it was difficult to ask additional questions. They were also very accommodating and helpful with our birthday celebration, giving us utensils and plates for the cake we brought and offering a lighter for the candles.",

Additionally, I asked for the hottest that they had, and it wasn't that spicy :( I guess all in all, this place is a no go for me. It is good, but not good enough to warrant having to park in shadyside, have cash on hand (cash only), and not get spicy enough food....and the ATM charged me the fee twice..boo",

Today I brought two of my friends here. Some of the kindest guys I know. There was a group of around 10 of us and we were a little rowdy (as sometimes groups of college aged students are at noodlehead). Regardless, the manager told us to \"chill out\" and then continued to single out my two guy friends. She said they came in often and \"were always rowdy\". My friends are African and are by no means regulars at noodlehead. They tried to point out the managers mistake but she adamantly kept insisting that they had been there many times before and acted the same way. It felt really pointed and inappropriate. Another one of my friends said she had interacted with the manager before in a negative way and that the whole situation was unwarranted. I hope in the future they decide who to profile because this was extremely disappointing. Do better.",

Street Noodle #2 - I loooooooved the thin noodles and bok choy in this dish.  I typically don't eat much fried food, so after starting with the Thai Fried Chicken appetizer, I found the tempura fried shrimp made for a heavy meal altogether.  Spice level: 1. Just enough heat for my liking, though most of the spice seemed to gather towards the bottom of my bowl.  This provided a nice smack in the tastebuds every few bites.  Kee Mao - Next up was a takeout order, during which I made my way to the second half of the noodle menu to try the Kee Mao with shrimp.  Even after I was full, I couldn't stop picking at this.  So good.  Spice level: 1. Totally delicious and I was craving more of these noodles for a solid week after.   Green Curry Linguine - This caught my eye on both of my previous visits. It was time. I've only had curry one other time in my life, about 5 years ago, so my first concern was \"do I even like curry?\"  Answer: Yes. Yes I do.  It came out HOT (temperature-wise), and still not going beyond a spice level 1 was a good move on my part. There was just enough heat and I just about joined the Clean Plate Club. I did ask for it without eggplant for personal preference, but the veggies I did get were all crisp and delicious.    Street Noodle #1 - My dine-in experiences have all included an order of the Thai Fried Chicken for an appetizer, so I decided to kill two delicious, flightless birds with one stone on my most recent visit.  I wasn't disappointed in the least.  The fried chicken atop my pyramid of noodles, bok choy, and bean sprouts was crisp and flavorful, and my tried and True spice level 1 packed just enough heat to warm me up from the inside out on a chilly Pittsburgh evening.

Update: I've returned to Noodlehead a few times this year and have been pleasantly surprised. Perhaps the first time was just a fluke, but since then the pad see ew has not been overly sweet, and well sauced. Chicken is generally on the dry side though.

The restaurant is clean with modern decor and the atmosphere is vibrant with large visiting younger crowds around college age.  The wait at this restaurant is surprising; parties were outside waiting on a Saturday at 2pm. Luckily, with the 2 of us, we were seated within the first 10 minutes. Service was prompt and to the point.  Food was decent; we started with Crispy Veggie Spring Rolls. They had a good finish and crisp, but the inside didn't seem to have anything special, and flavor was missing. For our entrees, we had the Beef Soup and Street Noodle 1. Street Noodle 1 was unique in flavor, but overall, both dishes were just okay for me. They didn't have particularly interesting tastes or flavors that left a strong or memorable impression.  Overall, the restaurant is certainly popular and the dishes are generous in portion, but the experience of the different noodles and flavors were lacking.",

The ambience doesn't look or feel like your typical Thai restaurant -- think casual hipster brewery with very little light and a lot of wooden fixtures. For a very modern-looking restaurant, I was surprised (and annoyed) that they only accept cash. They're well aware that it's unusual to be cash only in 2019, so they've graciously provided an ATM for you inside the restaurant. lololol.  For each of the noodle dishes, you have a choice of spice level on a scale from 0 (\"not hot\") to 5 (\"crazy hot!!!\"). I ordered the chiang mai curry and opted for one level below \"Thai hot!!\". When I think \"Thai hot\", I can feel sweat dripping down my forehead while I fan my mouth and sloppily utter, \"omg... *pause for panting* hurts *more panting* so good\". Based on my unexpectedly underwhelming medium (level 3) spice, I probably should've gone for the hottest option they had. :/  But! The curry itself was flavorful. The noodles were the perfect texture. And the crispy noodles on top were a great addition. The chicken was dry but added some light acidity to the dish (ionno maybe they marinate it in vinegar?). At $9.50 per dish, I'd definitely come back.",

(Guess that's pretty much every Saturday afternoon in Pittsburgh) We came during an off-hour where it was in between lunch time and dinner but still had about a 20 min wait.  Started off with the sweet and spicy pig wings. These were fantastic. It was clearly pork but was made to look like chicken wings. They had a tiny bit of spice but it was a perfect amount of sweet. The pork was so flavorful and tender.  For my entree I ordered the Kee Mao and asked for the Thai fried chicken as my protein. The fried chicken was super yummy. The noodles were absolutely perfect. It held the sauces and flavors of the dish well. I did order this with level 4 spice and it was pretty spicy. But I love every bite of the dish.  The spicy dish warmed me up enough to tackle the rest of the cold, wet afternoon.  I would totally go back. Great good and great ambiance!",

I have tried almost every noodle dish on the menu and I have enjoyed everything I have tried to a point where I can never decide what to order. This place is very accommodating to a vegetarian diet, and allows substitutions for tofu in every dish. The tofu is crispy and slightly spongey in the best way, and the sweet potato triangles and the sweet sauce they come with are amazing. Noodlehead also has delicious vegetable spring rolls.   The wait can get ridiculous on weekend evenings, especially when the weather is nice. They do not have a phone or take reservations, so make sure you allot extra time if you plan on going to Noodlehead at a peak time. That being said, it's definitely worth the wait. Noodlehead only charges a 50c fee if you BYOB, and it's cash only so come prepared!",

We came here after the suggestion of some CMU students, the 1000+ reviews also looked promising. I love Thai food and was excited to see a line forming outside a restaurant in Pittsburgh. A line usually means the food is good right? Eh, not so much in this case.   The menu didn't have a lot of selection to begin with, that means everything on it must be amazing right? After all, the chefs have more time to refine each dish. Eh, not so much in this case. I got the Chiang Mai curry. All I tasted was spiciness (and I only got slightly hot after reading the reviews). The chicken was also dry. Definitely wasn't worth the half hour wait.  I'm sure I'll make my way back here as there aren't many options. Next time, I'm going to stick with my go to Thai dish, Pad Thai, even if it's basic. Hard to mess that dish up.",

There's an ATM in the restaurant but of course there is a fee.  The entrees are pretty spicy, so whatever you think you can handle, go a little lower. I think the spice level I chose really affected how much I enjoyed the food and next time I would pick a lower spice level.

They don't take reservations and don't have a phone line last I've been and are quite popular so be ready for a wait on weekends.   The place is byob for 50 cents.   Every. Single. Plate. Is. Phenomenal. Almost all the plates are $9 and it is CASH ONLY. They have an atm in the back.   My favorite dishes are pad see yew and kee mao. The pad Thai is a popular favorite too! There spice level goes from 0-5 and as a spice lover I think even 4 is pretty darn spicy. They just changed the type of chillis they use so just be careful with that. Go there and literally try everything. You won't be disappointed.",

I cannot believe this is what others claimed as Pittsburgh's best Thai food.   I give two stars: 1 for being edible 2 for nice staff.   I got the shrimp pad see ew. At most decent to say the least not absolutely terrible but definitely not good and not the best Thai ever. The noodles didn't even taste stir fried. It tasted like noodles mixed with bear minimum soy sauce. There were tiny cheap shrimps and Frozen broccoli florets. Super oily! Order spicy level 1 couldn't taste a bit of spiciness.   NOT GOOD I DO NOT RECOMMEND. ITS OVERHYPED! Price is cheap for a dinner meal.   Anyways how authentic can this place be it doesn't even have Thai iced tea? The cashier had no idea what talking was. Is that not a thing in Pittsburgh? Cute place, was super full on a Sunday evening but not good. IT AIN'T THAI FOOD!!!!!",

What makes noodlehead 5 stars are; 1) the offerings are few and they execute well on each. It's so good and so consistent. I've tried almost everything on their menu and I think the best is the chiang mai curry 2) I think there is no better price to quality trade off in Pittsburgh. Everything is less than $10. 3) it's BYOB, which I love .   The only complaint I have is there is more demand than they can handle. Open a second location! Or expand your current location. Also, they are cash only, which for me would usually be a complaint but they are so good I am willing to inconvenience myself with keeping a few extra $$ around for my not infrequent craving for high quality Thai food.",

    "text": "Noodlehead never lets me down. The only small inconvenience is that this place is CASH ONLY but they do have an ATM on-site.  I always get the pad see yew or pad kee mao. They're both very good. I tend to get spice level 3 (out of 5) because I like things with more of a kick... but if you're not feeling too adventurous, play it safe. Honestly, there are slight inconsistencies with the spice levels (presumably due to different chefs) but the food is of good quality nonetheless, so I'm not complaining!  I also love the steamed pork buns! They're simple but delicious. The fried sweet potato triangles are addictive too!  I've tried my friends' street noodles and green curry, and I'm honestly convinced that Noodlehead can never let me down.  Even the interior of the place is so nice! It's very modern. I love the lighting fixtures and the wooden tones.  The service is always amazing too! Everyone is so friendly and quick to refill your water vases.  This is a must-go-place for anyone who lives in or is visiting Pittsburgh!!",

    "text": "4.5 stars rounding up to 5 stars. Noodlehead is one of those local gems in Pittsburgh which serves authentic Thai noodles dishes. It's actually quite rare to find good, authentic Asian food in Pittsburgh. The truth is there arent just many..and Noodlehead is likely the only one Thai restaurants that serves non-Americanized Thai food at a super reasonable price.  The sukhothai noodle I got was not only super affordable at $6 but also on point. The spicy lime based soup and spice in it took me back to the time I spent in Thailand. It was pretty memorable. I actually had been to Pittsburgh quite a few times 10+ years ago..and boy..they definitely didn't have this type of restaurant in Pittsburgh back then.  They also have other varieties of noodles dishes (many of them are just $9)  like Chiangmai kaosoi noodles that I wished I had time to try as well. Unfortunately, my time in Pittsburgh wasnt so long, so I couldn't get to try other dishes there. The truth was..I actually tried to stop by there again for an early lunch...but I think they opened quite late..so I didnt get to try it again before I leave.  If I lived in Pittsburgh, I would stop by this place often for sure. And oh..bring cash..they don't take credit cards..and be prepared to wait in line if you are going for dinner.",

    "text": "I was very excited to try this restaurant because it is always packed and everyone raves about it.   I came here with my girlfriend to get some lunch. They only had the window bar seats open so we agreed to just sit there. We waited for almost 10 minutes for a server to come to take our order. I finally got up because another table opened and I asked the host if we could just sit there. She was hesitant and asked if we had already ordered our food. Which we had not so she let us move to the table. (If I had not gotten up who knows how long it would have been for our order to be taken.)  We sat down and we finally ordered. We got the Dumplings, pork buns and Chiang Mai Noodles.   The apps came out shortly after we ordered. The dumplings were small and it was not worth the price. The pork buns had great flavor and I would order them again!  The Chiang Mai Noodles were good but not the best curry I've ever had at a Thai restaurant. The portion was reasonable for the price and the flavors were good! I just would have liked more veggies throughout the dish. There were supposed to be mustard greens in the dish but I honestly am not sure if they were even in there because there was so little throughout. I liked the noodles they were cooked well and seemed fresh!   The menu was very limited. That is sometimes a good thing but in this case I think they could expand the menu a little bit. The service wasn't horrible but it took someone a long time until they noticed that my table needed more water.   The spicy levels are also True to the description, which I can really appreciate! I would come back to try something else because I'd give them another try. I was just a bit disappointed.",

    "text": "The food is wonderful and inexpensive. I usually get the Love Boat (which is especially wonderful when it's a bit cold out and you need some warming up) and the steamed pork buns. If you think bbq pork on a steamed bun might be up your alley even a little, please try some! The tastes and textures are amazing together. The See Yew is also delicious. I found the green curry and the pad thai to be perfectly adequate, but nothing to write home about. I highly recommend the honey lemongrass iced tea with your meal, as well. It complements everything perfectly. The spice levels at Noodlehead cover a decent range and are consistent. The hottest level will be hotter than your typical Americanized fair. Most of the dishes are very customizable as well, and will be made to order.  If you come in the evening, there will likely be a wait, and the sidewalk outside and the entryway will be crowded. However, the wait is usually less than 15min. I've always experienced wonderful service here, and my food is always ready before I expect it. The noise level is higher than I usually gravitate toward (both in terms of music and what you can hear from other tables), and the atmosphere isn't what I'd call intimate, so that's something to keep in mind.   I do find the decor to be relaxing and comfortable. It's a rustic industrial mashup with real plants and flowers popping up in surprising places. The temperature in Noodlehead is good: neither frigidly cold AC, nor is it uncomfortably hot, even when the place is crowded in the summer and you're eating spicy food.   I think this place may be difficult to navigate in a wheelchair (no steps that I remember, but lots of narrow walkways and tight turns), tho they do have outdoor seating which may be more accessible, weather permitting.",

However, they are well worth the wait. They have a spicy scale from 1-5. But beware! They take their spice levels very seriously. I consider myself a fan of spicy food and I can handle a 2 at the most. Definitely give noodlehead a try if you haven't been yet. It's my favorite place to get Thai food.",

I find their noodles not flavored enough, especially lacking in the citrus category. It doesn't taste authentically Thai, which throws me off. However, the restaurant does a good job with their spicy options. From 1-10, you get mild to extremely spicy (I warned you). Also, their pork dumpling appetizer is really amazing, combining an interesting combo of pork with pickles.   So pork dumplings were good, place is nice, but just thought the noodles in the main spotlight fell short of what I wanted.",

Definitely my top pick! Street Style Noodles#1 - noodles with really deliciously fried chicken.  You also get quite a bit of chicken.  So even though I felt like the portion was a little small, it's actually really filling!   My main complaint with this dish is that the sauce was a little too sweet in my opinion.  The sauce is a good balance with the fried chicken, but there was just a little too much of it.",

Unfortunately, there was a slight mix-up with what I ordered, but the hostess quickly fixed the problem in a very professional and warm manner. I had the Chaing Mai Curry, which was super good, packed with flavor, and not too spicy (I do not like spicy food). My boyfriend had the Street Noodle #2 and also really enjoyed it.",

A note of caution, if you order something hot (3) it's like a seven or eight on a traditional Asian spiciness scale.  Service was a non-issue, they were not very busy yet, but everyone we spoke to was very friendly and courteous.   Can't wait to come back for dinner.",

The buns are so good that the entrees pale in comparison. It's dual sour and salty flavor really took me by surprised. Furthermore, the meat just melts in your mouth, bursting with flavor. The bun itself was fluffy and nicely done.  As for the Street Noodle #1, I really enjoyed the fried chicken, but the sour noodles just didn't sit well with me. It's the reason why I gave Noodlehead 4 stars instead of a much deserving 5.  I had a taste of my friend's Chiang curry, which was much better than the Street Noodle #1.",

    "text": "Great food. Reasonable prices. Heaping portions.  I was really happy with my see yew with tofu. This $9 dish easily fed me for two meals. My friend was equally impressed with her curry. I also liked that you can customize the spice level of your meal. I thought the level 3 was pretty spicy, so I can't imagine what level 5 (the highest) tastes like. The restaurant is also BYOB + 50 cent charge per person!  Now, let me get to why this restaurant is worthy of 4 stars, but not 5. The decor is really cute. I love the candles and all of the wood details. However, a flimsy stool made of wire is not a comfortable place to sit and have a meal. I get they are going for a hipster vibe and have mismatching seats at the their tables. But they at least need to be comfortable. My weird stool was too low and made my butt hurt. Get some new chairs.  Also, get a phone. If you want to carry out, you have to stand in the vestibule and wait for your food instead of calling ahead for a fast pick-up.I understand it's your decision not to take reservations, which is fine. I understand it's your decision to not take credit cards, which I can live with. But you're a restaurant and you need a phone.",

The pad thai, chiang mai curry, street noodles, and the pork belly buns are all very legit and well worth your time.   A few downsides: BYOB and cash only, and for takeout there's no phone orders or online ordering, which means you'll have to go there and place your order. As long as you don't go during the peak times it shouldn't be too bad of a wait (10-15 minutes tops). Also, when it gets busy the service level does seem to drop a bit for dine-in, but not enough to drop a star off my review. One more thing: their spice levels seem to vary day-to-day, sometimes a 2 is very spicy and a 3 is more mild.  All in all, if you find yourself visiting Shadyside, this place is definitely worth a visit.",

    "text": "Hello all. You don't know me yet but you will some day. I am a restaurant professional who has been in virtually every position in the business, including gm for over 7 years, owner, bartender, server, cook, host, wine steward, and server.   Yelp is a broken system that does not take into account the level of knowledge of the reviewer. This means any person, regardless of whether or not they have ever even eaten sushi in their whole lives can defame a great sushi restaurant because the fish was cold. Maybe their review will be taken with a grain of salt but that all powerful star rating will be affected. I am aiming to help mitigate the lost trust in yelp and it's army of posters by giving a professional expert opinion regarding restaurants.   Now- noodle head.  Atmosphere and construction: The decor is interesting and very well done, featuring petrified wood and copper and iron with lots of track lighting and nice looking chic tables. It also features \"picnic\" tables for communal family dining in the center. The space is slightly cramped but not to the point of discomfort. They have some small tables for outside dining in warmer times. The restrooms are to the rear left of the building and were clean and stocked.   The service: The night we were in they were very busy. It was a mild and balmy Tuesday but they were nearly full. the greeting was pleasant and they sat us fairly quickly. They explained the menu and how it all worked and said a server would be right with us. We waited about 9 minutes for a server to arrive and then an additional 10 minutes for waters. My soda did not come for about 20 mijutes. (After we got our appetizer) After this snafu the server was very polite and seemed to know a fair amount about the food, but not an expert. No other service issues happened.   The menu: It is small, concise, and fun to read. It was easy even for people who do not frequently eat Asian food. Not a lot of options, but you'll see why that doesn't much matter here in my opinion.   The food:  Outstanding. My wife got the see yu and I got noodles #1 with a spicy level of 4. It was as hot as I expected. The food was a bit salty, but not offensively. The flavor was exceptional and the dishes were obviously well designed as nothing seemed out of place. The rice noodles were cooked perfectly, and rice noodles are notoriously hard to cook.   The bar: not applicable. It is byob. They were accommodating with glassware for wine drinkers.  The experience: Despite some issues in the beginning with service we left very happy. The busy nature of the location, friendly staff up front, excellent and concise menu, delicious food, and well designed interior made this a True delight. Not a good fancy night out spot but if you're in a fun mood and hungry for Eastern, This is one of my top recommendations.   R",

You can eat cheap if you're not starving, or you can spend more and eat a lot of good food. And, yes, he pork belly steamed buns are as good as you've heard.  Also, I've experienced very good service. The only downside is that parking can sometimes be a bit scarce.",

I've had a lot of Pad Thai in Pittsburgh, and the quality has varies greatly between venues, so I was trepidatious about ordering it.

You can customize your spice level, and they are usually pretty spot on.   It's BYOB, which is fantastic, considering there aren't too many of these spots in the city. Note that it's cash only, but this actually works to your advantage because the prices are low. Only $9 for noodles!  My favorites are the Chiang Mai and Kee Mao. I get them on the spicy side, and if I'm in the mood for creamy curry with a kick I go for the Chiang Mai. If I'm feeling spicy, chubby noodles, I go for the Kee Mao. You really can't beat the price.  The street noodles are a little greasy for me, but most serious carnivores I know always gravitate toward these dishes because they really pile on the meat.  Try the steamed pork belly buns to start, although they are so filling you may not finish your noodles.",

There's nothing wrong with the food, price or staff, I just wish they would make a few concessions to the customer. I never like cash only. But the no telephone, no advance take-out order setup is puzzling at best. Having no phone line is something I've never seen in a restaurant like this, I just don't get it. Many restaurants of similar size and quality have no issue pulling it off. Parking is hassle enough much less being forced to stand around awkwardly. I like the fare here, a lot in fact, but they've lost business on many occasions simply because needless hurdles were in the way.",

Good went down hill quickly from there. Dumpling were terrible I would not be surprised if they were frozen.

The spice level option is also a major plus as I can't handle alot of spice but being able to choose just how much you want is great. Although fried, the chicken was very tender and juicy. The noodles in the sauce were also a great pairing with the chicken. The restaurant itself has a very casual ambiance  and the staff was very helpful even with the place being crowded.",

    "text": "It would be a difficult task to top my two other favorite Thai places in the vicinity, but Noodlehead  surpasses them slightly for its hip and modern atmosphere.  I stopped in with one of my girlfriends per her recommendation on Friday night around 9pm for a late dinner. It was still busy, although they close at 10.  We were worried there would be a wait, but we were seated right away.  The place is big and bustling with a lot of seating, and I have heard it still almost always have a wait!!    We forgot that it was BYOB (oops!!), but a lot of other tables around us had bottles of wine - and I'm not sure of the corking fee.  We ordered the steamed pork buns to start, and then we both ordered the Pad Thai - mine with shrimp and hers with chicken.  The pork buns were AMAZING.  Soft seamed buns with tangy bbq pulled pork on the inside with pickle slices and cilantro - I could've eaten 10.  Shortly after, our food arrived.  What a huge serving for $9!  It was good - not amazing.  Not better than my other Thai staples Pad Thai dish. Needed some lime and soy sauce to jazz it up.  Next time I come back, I wouldn't be opposed to trying the street noodles or one of the curry dishes.  I would come back for the atmosphere alone.  Our service was mediocre - not bad, but our waitress wasn't very personable.  Pricing was extremely reasonable (cash only) and everything was OK.  I'd try it again!",

    "text": "I was nearby and hungry so some friends recommended Noodlehead.  I saw several people gathered around the entrance which made the decision to order takeout rather easy.  I made my way through the crowd of people trying to get their name on the wait list.  Once inside, I was unsure where to go to place my order and was ignored by a couple employees before one finally made eye contact and told me she'd be right with me.  Things weren't looking good.  I ordered Street Noodles #1 (with rice noodles, Thai fried chicken, bok choy and cilantro) and the Pork Belly Steamed Buns.  I was told they prepare food pretty spicy so I went with a 1 on their spicy scale of 0-5.  I was told my order would take 20-25 minutes but it took maybe only 10-15.  The Street Noodles weren't anything spectacular.  It was a healthy serving and pretty much what I expected.  They do not, I repeat, they do not mess around with that spicy scale.  If my meal was a 1, I'd hate to try a 2.  I'm happy to report those steamed buns were out of this world (and the main reason I'm giving Noodlehead 3 stars instead of 2).  I can understand it's a busy Sunday evening.  But I waited longer to place my order than it took to make my order.  Perhaps they were short-staffed that night but it just seemed chaotic and could have been more organized at the entrance.  Other deterrents are: cash only, no reservations, no phone.  Noodlehead is, however, BYOB.  The interior atmosphere is cool and casual.  I thought the prices were reasonable (my total was around $16).  I wouldn't be opposed to dining there, in fact maybe the atmosphere would enhance my enjoyment.  I would just need a few extra BYOBs if there's a long wait.",

It should be known that the seating style is a mix of community tables and private. Also, it is BYOB which saved us some money on our bubbly. Fortunately for me the waitress Maria was very attentive and didn't skip a beat with bringing water for my scorching taste buds.  Not everyone will be pleased but I would definitely give it a shot and try the curry if your not sure what to get. Very lively atmosphere.  Was very satisfied.",

It's okay, though...they make up for those slight inconveniences by offering delicious food at a fair price, a lively, but cozy atmosphere, and being BYOB!  The space is really nice, and always packed after about 6 or so. I wouldn't recommend stopping in with a larger group unless you a) get there early, or b) aren't in a rush, because you'll definitely be waiting. The service is good, and the staff has always been nice, whether we at in or got takeout.  As for the food, I love it. It's obviously subjective, but their noodle dishes more-or-less rival my favorite dishes from other Thai places in Pgh. The pad thai is flavorful, but lacks the oiliness that Nicky's (one of my favorites on flavor) tends to have. The pad see yew is predictably sweet, the kee mao is awesome in it's own right and always battles it out for my noodle dish of choice. Those are the only three that I've tried and I've really enjoyed them all...so much so that I haven't felt the need to stray...yet.  Their snacks also win me over. I enjoyed the Thai fried chicken, but it wouldn't be my first choice. The slice grilled beef is awesome, as well, but if you're only going to order one thing on the \"snacks\" menu, you MUST try the pork belly steamed buns. Every time we order them, I always wish I had ordered another order (or two). The texture, with the pillowy bun and the flavors...droooooool.   It's also fairly-priced. For example, you can grab takeout for two (two noodle dishes) for under $20. Yeah, it's not the cheapest noodles you'll ever find, but you won't feel like you overspent by any means after you try the noodles. The food also comes out fast, whether you order dine-in or takeout, so don't be deterred due to the lack of being able to call ahead to place your to-go order. It'll be out in a matter of minutes! Enjoy!",

The See Yew is also good, very traditional and would try again.   The kitchen staff look like Thai so that's a good sign for Thai food. They don't accept credit cards and I never carry cash but luckily I had enough to cover the bill so BRING CASH.   Service is excellent, low light ambience setting, clean, and modern. Price is very fair. Popular among the college scene and busy as well. I definitely will come back to try their other dishes. Also, BYOB with 50 cent recycle charges.",

    "text": "What a change a remodel can make to the atmosphere! I was pleasantly surprised walking in here. Gone is the stuffy atmosphere and in it's place is a fresh and funky scene. I loved the modern take with lots of dark colors that make it feel intimate and cozy. With some good alt rock jams flowing through the place, I was into this place before I even got the meal!  The menu is very simple with only a handful of choices. Not being an expert, I picked the thing that looked best to me, the Street Noodles #2 which was fried shrimp, bok choy and chili sauce for $9. I was happy to see plenty of crispy, fluffy fried shrimp. I was not happy to see how small the dish was for $9. Maybe it's my big American appetite getting the best of me, but i thought it was kinda small. Plus, for $9 I expected more. I think dropping it to $7.50 and keeping the size of the dish would be perfect. Or maybe tossing in more noodles and keeping it at $9. Spicy factor, just right for my lame non-spicy loving palate. Well, I love it, but I cry. It just gets messy, trust me!  I like the fact that they have Boylans soda, because I love me some Boylan's Cream Soda! Plus, it's BYOB, so you can grab your fave bottle of vino to enjoy with your noodles. But remember to also grab the cash, because it's CASH ONLY!",

(Still had a hard time choosing what I wanted though because everything looked yummy.) Felt like we got a good amount of food for what we paid.   We ordered the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, Thai Fried Chicken, and the Pad Thai. I thought they were all tasty, though nothing extraordinary. My boyfriend who doesn't usually like noodles actually liked the Pad Thai, so that's saying something. A great place to go for a well done Thai food in a somewhat hipster atmosphere. I would definitely stop by again!",

    "text": "Do I even need to explain why this place gets 5 stars?  The flat pricing and cash only structure (with a $0.50 per person BYO charge) keeps it simple and totally affordable, and I've almost always got leftovers to take home after a meal here.  As a vegetarian with a million food allergies, I can vouch that they take extra care to double check and make recommendations for me every time. All of their dishes are super well-presented, tasty, and their spicy levels are just right. Ordering a 2 is noticeably different from a 3.  Also important to note... it's a 0 to 5 spice level scale. I once confidently ordered a level 5, thinking it was out of 10, and had to chase them down to switch it to a 2. Lesson learned!",

Spice level is legitimately hot if you go 2 or higher, and the ingredients they use are fresh and vibrant.  Service: 6/6 All servers and workers are friendly, and approachable. The food comes out quickly, whether it be for take-out, or dine-in. Atmosphere: 5/6 Great decor, and a really down-to-Earth and relaxing feel. The lighting makes it feel cozy, yet modern. Really the only reason this isn't a 6/6 is because sometimes I don't like the chairs/booths. Affordability: 6/6 All items on the menu are pretty cheap, $9 being the most expensive thing.

That aside, I was excited for my dish, kee mao. I thought it was very good, but my mother had a terrible experience. Her pad see ew was one of the worst I've ever had--it was so greasy and heavy, and had an odd aftertaste. When she told the server she didn't really care for it and would prefer to have my dish, he told her he would charge her. There was no manager to talk to. When we paid, the server said that because my mom did not explicitly said she doesn't like her dish (semantics), they refused to make accommodations. My mom said that we've had pad see ew that's lighter elsewhere and the server told her to go back to other places rather than eat at Noodlehead. She even acknowledged that they don't really care about customer service. Atrocious--not the way customers are meant to be treated.",

    "text": "I'm really having some trouble figuring out how to review this place. Let's start with the good things...  Good - The food was good. Not anything special and/or outstanding. But it was good. The menu is small, meaning (hopefully) they do all of the items well. And you can pick your spice level from 0 (none) to 5 (super spicy). I had a 3 and it was good.  Unfortunately, there are several bad things. None of these alone would keep you away...but it is important to know about them.  Bad - Very little street parking (although, you can go a block or two away and park for free on the side streets)  Bad - Cash only. I don't understand why, but Pittsburgh seems to have more \"cash only\" places than any other city I've been in. They do have an ATM on site.  Really bad - They don't have a phone. That's unheard of these days. That means you can't call and see what the wait is like. That means you can't call in a take out order (you can go there, order, and wait).  The place is usually busy, so I don't understand why they won't invest a few bucks in a credit card reader or, more notably, a phone.  Also of note...when we were there, it seemed like there were only a couple of servers. It didn't necessarily affect our food service (food was still hot), but it was tough to find someone when we needed more water and had a question.  Overall I'd say...go. Stop by, eat, see what you think. The food is good...and if you know about all the negative things ahead of time, you'll know what you're getting into.   (note - the picture is the pad thai with chicken after a couple bites...sorry, I was hungry)",

There was a 10-15 min wait when we got there at around 8:30 PM on Saturday night. Although they have a bar area to sit, it is important to note that they do not serve any alcoholic drinks (BYOB for $0.50 recycling fee). We ordered the steamed pork buns to start, which were of the pulled pork variety, a bit different from the traditional slab of pork belly (but the same cut of meat). They were oily, flavorful goodness. I have had better buns (fluffier, softer ones) in NYC but these were decent. Anyway, on to the noodles! We ordered the Chiang Mai curry noodles, which were very creamy and flavorful. This dish is already fairly spicy to begin with so I would caution adding spice to this one. The curry noodles' spiciness probably even surpassed the other two dishes we ordered with a spice level of 2. We also ordered the Sukothai and Love Boat because the menu advertises ordering one dish as a snack and two for a meal. Honestly, I would have been satisfied with one of the smaller $6 bowls on its own and was unable to finish the large Chiang Mai curry bowl. Of the two $6 bowls, I liked the Sukothai better. Sort of annoyingly, this place only takes cash, so be prepared when you come - or there is an ATM located in the back of the restaurant. All in all, an enjoyable meal and good noodles!",

The first headache was in figuring out how to coordinate that effort (which is effortless at 99%) of restaurants... We looked them up online to find they don't take reservations. OK, that's fairly common... So we wanted to call and ask the best way of seating 10 people. Oddly, they don't have a phone or accept calls either... So we emailed them, and were told to send some of our party an hour early to grab a table. 3 of us showed up as directed and we were told they'd clean the long table for us and seat us when the rest of our party arrived.  An hour later, 8 of our party of 10 were there, and even though our table was cleared we werent allowed to be seated because their policy is to not seat us til EVERYONE was accounted for. The 8 of us filled the entire waiting area, making other guests wait outside in 90+ degree weather. We were reluctantly in the way of the hostess and other guests, and also the table cleaning employees who for whatever reason have to carry dirty dishes across the main entryway to get to the kitchen. Twice one of us backed into a busboy carrying a stack of dishes while we were trying to avoid other foot traffic in the restaurant. It was also hot and humid by the door and waiting area, so we were all drenched in sweat by the time we actually got to our table.  Upon being seated, a service man unexpectedly delivered us 5 plates of appetizers. I thought perhaps this was to make up for the confusion and delay in getting seated, but this was not the case. As we started digging into the apps, the man came back and abruptly took them away from us; apparently they were meant for another table. We'd already started eating them but the restaurant felt it more appropriate to throw them in the garbage.   Our server was excellent and took good care of our party, and the food was decent, which is all that earned them 2 stars in this review. The food was decent, but nothing special.... My friends on either side of my and I ordered the 3 different noodle plates with chicken, and upon trying each others' meals found them to taste identical, only difference being either flat noodles or rice noodles. Food quality or portion was no better than your standard fast food Thai, nothing remarkable or authentic. I bit into 2 bone chunks in my chicken and alot of chewy fat, so the meat used isnt whitemeat or any special quality. Only difference in the food between Noodlehead and a Thai takeout joint was Noodlehead cost more and any eggrolls or soup appetizers are charged separately instead of being included with the meal. As far as taste, it couldn't compare to good authentic cuisine like Nicky's Thai, who is also cheaper and includes a soup or salad with any meal.  Noodlehead doesn't accept credit cards, which isn't a huge deal, however it's strange for a classy modern restaurant to penny pinch in that regard, especially considering what they charge for overpriced unremarkable meals. Tack on another $3 ATM fee to pull cash from their ATM (which had a line of people behind it who also were baffled at the cash only policy.)   Our check total was over $150 for 10 people, and they tacked on a 20% automatic gratuity for our large party. Of course they wouldn't split that check so we had a fun time calculating how much everyone owed on our own. With this added headache of the restaurants reluctance to split the check, no one felt the urge to tip over the automatic 20%, yet since no one had an abundance of $1 bills we still ended up leaving an extra 10% or so (and like I mentioned, we had no complaints with our waitress so didn't want to make her suffer for the overall negative experience.)  I normally like to talk cordially with management about any issues before posting a negative review, but was then reminded they don't have a phone in the restaurant. Rather than typing this all up in an email that may or may not get a response, I figured I'd cut to the chase and tell others of the experience they can expect at Noodlehead.  In summary, if you like sweating in a crowded waiting area, carry an abundance of cash on person, have a party of no more than 2, and are in the mood for overpriced Thai fast food in a nice decor, Noodlehead is right up your alley. If you want quality or authentic Asian food and a simple straightforward meal experience, go ANYWHERE else.",

We stopped by on a Friday afternoon for a late-ish lunch (2pm), and most other places we looked up were not yet open. The staff was super friendly, the food came out quickly.

We had a slight wait, arriving around 7 on a Friday night, but we're happy to seemly beat a greater rush. We started with the pork buns and despite being non-traditional, we thought they were the best we've had in Pittsburgh and loved the cucumber crunch. I had he pad Thai and he had a fat noodle dish with tofu and we both wiped our plates clean. The medium spiciness may be a bit mild for some, as it was perfect for someone like me who only likes a small kick.  The prices were also a highlight, only $9 per entree and we will definitely partake in the BYOB next time! We will be back!",

The pork bun appetizer was by FAR the best thing on the menu that we tried. It was soft, sweet, and delicious with some pickles as well. I also had the homemade iced tea which was outstanding.   As for the main course, we ordered the Love Boat and the Street Noodles with the tempura shrimp. Both were alright. I'd say that the Love Boat was better, but maybe that is because it was a soup versus a noodle dish (you have the option of getting both). I ordered the Street Noodles as a 3 out of 5 spiciness, but it ended up being just a little bit too spicy for my taste.  That all being said, it was just about as good, if not better, than most noodle places in Pittsburgh. They are new, but I'd definitely recommend giving them a shot! I know that I'll be returning many many times to try everything else on the menu (and to get some more pork buns!)",

    "text": "What can I say, this place isn't bad at all, in fact its actually really delicious but here's my pro/con list for you.  All the food: Delicious.  You cannot go wrong whatever you get.  Beef noodle soup, although not authentically Chinese, Taiwanese, Thai, Viet, is what i LIKE about it.  Anyone who calls this place \"non-authentic\" is missing the point.  It's a fusion of lots of asian flavors, where you can find green Thai chilli in the same dish as fried chicken and noodles--but it works, so put your damn pinky down and take your fancy-flavor discriminating tongue somewhere else.  The Chang Mai curry is surprisingly a favorite among all my friends that have eaten there.  Oh did I mention BYOB? Yeah, awesome.  Not so hot: Pork buns are $6 for 2.  Although tasty.. not worth it, but this is the only place where you can really get any in town.  If it were $4, I'd get them every time.  Also, the service is just a hit or miss.  I personally don't give a damn how you treat me as long as you bring my food out when it's hot and check back in a timely fashion.  One time, in a half empty house, slow service, my waitress with an attitude helped herself to an $8 tip on a $12 bill.  I treat anyone who handles my food with the utmost respect because frankly, I am scared of pubes and spit, but this strange service happens 30% of the time I go there.  Just carry exact change, bring a bottle of wine, and enjoy an awesome meal.",

I hate the street noodles with fried chicken and let's be fair, after the perfect appetizer it wasn't as good. I still ate it and took some home, but I would probably go back to have those steamed buns!  Side note: The service was not very good, normally I don't like to downgrade a restaurant for their service, but our server wasn't nice at all. He wasn't friendly and didn't check on us once we had ordered. We didn't see him again until we had to track someone down for our check. That was disappointing and did take away from our experience.   But.. WOOHOO Pork steamed buns!",

The restaurant is beautiful, the BYOB option is cool, and the food is great, but I still can't give them four stars. If I had reviewed them after my visit two weeks ago, I would have given them two stars based on that one night alone.  But anyways... I feel like I should share about the other 20 times I've visited Noodlehead before I complain about my really crappy service on one visit.   I used to get Street Noodles #2 with Tempura Shrimp and Bok Choy and then I started getting the See Yew. I got bored with both because for whatever reason I just kept eating the same things every time I went there (not Noodlehead's fault because they have a lot of other really great options.) I've recently started to integrate the Pad Thai and Green Curry Linguine and have been impressed each time. Overall, you can't really go wrong with the food. Their food is great and should be rated at least four stars, if not five.   Service has been hit or miss for me. Sometimes the staff isn't personable. Sometimes it feels like I'm trying to eat at lunch table of a popular kid in high school and I'm just not cool enough.  My terrible visit two weeks ago wasn't great from almost the moment I walked into the restaurant. The visit ended with me leaving my leftovers, walking to my car, walking back, being told through the door that they're closed by the first employee who doesn't listen to what we say and walks away with her hands in the air (its 10:06pm and they close at 10). Then a second employee coming to the door, not listening to me or my friend, and repeating the same \"we're closed\" over and over again. Then a third employee, who could have possibly been a bus boy, comes to the (closed) door and asks me what we need. He then walks away and we're staring through the door at our server who doesn't seem to want to acknowledge that she has made eye contact with us while we're standing there, and then a fourth employee unlocks the door, and hands me my leftovers and we walk away. I didn't NEED my leftovers and I was about to walk away, but my friend mentioned (after the first employee) that maybe they didn't understand and just thought we were there to eat, so we stayed at the door. And it was so weird with the second employee that I actually wanted to talk to someone after she walked away, so we stayed, miming and mouthing that we had \"left food\" there.   Noodlehead's webpage doesn't have any information (see for yourself), they have no phone (so no phone orders or reservations), and you can't be seated until every member of your party arrives (even if the restaurant is dead and at least half of the tables are open.)   I'm honestly still weirded out by the experience I had two weeks ago, but went there last week and ordered take out.",

They won't seat you until your entire group has arrived, they're cash only, and they don't take reservations or even have a phone, but the food is fantastic.  Go. Eat pork buns.",

Take-away is super quick even though you cant call ahead (they have no phone).   I love the pad thai (number 3 spicy) and the Chiang Mai Curry (number 2 spicy). Sweet potato appetizer is decent.",

We were seated 10 mins after our reservation (our entire group showed up 3-5 mins after our reservation, they don't seat incomplete groups, which I think is normal). We are quick eaters and wanted to hang out to enjoy the BYOB feature - however the 3rd time the waitress visited our table she had a check, and subsequently asked if we needed change at each visit. Within 55 minutes we felt pressured to depart. Best of all this was a Monday at 6:35 pm - hardly peak time to push for huge table turnover.  If you show up, expect to stay for less than an hour!",

I placed my order and the food arrived in minutes while I made small talk with the waiter on staff. The staff were warm and friendly, and that was just the start of my amazing dinner here.  The ginger beer they offer is excellent - just enough spice and heat and not too much ginger to over power the noodles. I had the pork buns to start and they were incredible - a good blend of pork and doughy flavor.  The Pad Thai was a real standout though. You can order it as hot as you want it, and I went for the Thai Hot because I love a bit of heat to my food. Noodlehead did not disappoint, and the portions are more than generous for the price.   There wasn't too much sauce on the noodles, and they were thin and plentiful to pick up all the flavors. The chicken was cut up into portions a bit large for my taste, and they were a bit dry, but not enough to take away from the overall meal.  If you get in before the large crowds, it's a nice place to get a good meal at a good price.",

What I love about Noodlehead is that while the menu is small, every thing that I have had on it is excellent. There is a certain element of comfort that comes with knowing exactly what you are going to order for dinner later, and how it is going to taste.   The standout dish for me is the chiang mai curry. I can not speak to it's authenticity, but this curry is everything I have ever wanted in a curry. It is creamy from the coconut milk, warm, and the pickled mustard greens add an interesting element. It is a fairly large dish so I always have leftovers to take with me (and when I say leftovers I really mean a few tablespoons of curry).   My other favorite dish is the Kee Mao which I get with tofu. Their tofu is crispy on the outside and is the perfect texture. It soaks up the spicy basil sauce from the dish.   The BYOB part is probably my favorite thing about Noodlehead. PS: there is a liquor store nearby in East Liberty right off of Highland Ave.",

The crispy chicken was absolutely delicious and were the perfect vehicle to dip in the noodle sauce. The slight sweetness of the sauce did not overwhelm the dish.   I would have given all 5 stars had it not been for our waiter. He took awhile to get to our table to get our orders and also took awhile to ask if we liked our food.

The waitress offered to move us a couple seats down but it didn't really make much of a difference so we just stayed put. This place doesn't offer a wide variety of menu options. The menu is very limited but it makes deciding what to order a lot easier, especially when you're hungry. I ordered the Chiang Mai curry noodles and my husband ordered the green curry linguine. They have spice levels used to indicate how spicy you want your dish to be. I love spicy but wasn't sure how to gauge the levels so I stuck with a 3. My husband ordered a 4 for his dish. The food service was very quick and prompt. My dish actually wasn't spicy for me at all and I ended up liking the green curry linguine more (my husband ended up liking my dish better so we switched plates). The green curry still ended up not being spicy for me so I ended up adding more sriracha into it. Overall, I think this place is pretty good and if I come back in the future, I am definitely ordering spicier!",

There wasn't much veggies or bok choy in the noodles which I was bummed about. Also ordered the pork buns. They looked very boring when they were brought out. They weren't dressed up with anything, not even a few sprinkles of arugula sprouts or sliced cucumbers like I saw in some of the photos posted on yelp. Wasn't really excited about eating them and when I tasted them, the excitement meter didn't budge. Again, they were fine. I vaguely remember they were kind of sweet, but certainly not memorable.

I quite enjoy eating really spicy foods and surprisingly \"hot\" actually equated to quite a spicy dish.  Both dishes were were tasty and large enough to save some for later.  The two majors downsides are that this restaurant only takes cash (which makes a restaurant seem cheap and generally leads to me avoiding it) and the seating leaves much to be desired in terms of comfort.

I got there at 12:15, shortly after they opened.  It is a wonderfully relaxed, seat yourself, BYOB, CASH ONLY place.    And the food....ooooooh the foooooood....  I got the pork belly steamed buns, which I could live on, honestly.  Absolutely amazing.  I tried the Sukothai, a soup on their \"snack\" menu.  Wonderful stuff.  And although I should have stopped there, and I didn't realize those two items would be a perfect meal, I also ordered the Street Noodles #2, which was also completely yum.  I got enough food for 2 meals for $22!!!     I have been telling everyone I know to check this place out.  A place this wonderful just further proves to me that Pittsburgh is becoming a foodie town.  A couple things to keep in mind:  - it is cash only, but there are 3 atms in a 2 block radius. - Being Shadyside, it is on street metered parking, and I recommend leaving S. Highland Street for a side street and walking a block or two.  Don't forget your quarters.",

    "text": "I had the loveboat which was just ok. Broth was over seasoned and flank steak tasteless. I was expecting a beautiful rich pork broth that can stand on its own, but had something that resembled pre packaged ramen. The prices are good, but like other reviews, portions are small, which is ok with me. Pork belly bun did not have pork belly, but rather roast pork ( shoulder?)  which did have a nice flavor/texture. My partner had street noodle #2, which tasted like someone poured a bottle of sweet chili sauce and tossed some fried shrimp on top. This place will probably do good because of near by college crowd, but for someone looking for a legit noodle place that resembles the likes of momofuku, don't bother. I personally like their other restaurant better, pusadee's garden.",

It is seat yourself, which is great in concept but I was a little turned off by my server coming to spray and wipe my table after we had already sat down.   Our server was pretty abrupt - I asked her for her recommendation for a noodle and she went on to impatiently recite, word for word, what was written on the menu. Not helpful. Someone at the next table over asked about the two different kinds of hot sauces on the table and she blurted \"you try\" before spinning on her heels and leaving.  The wait for food was a little long but reasonable. I tried the Steamed roasted pork buns and the Sokuthai, which were both really good. The other two in my party weren't so impressed by their choices, however. One said \"I could get a bigger tastier serving for less elsewhere\" and the other left hungry despite sharing an appetizer and having a $9 noodle because he has a typical guy appetite and the servings are a bit smaller than other comparable places.  I would come back for a meal during off-peak hours but the food and the service did not merit the growing line out the door as we left.",

    "text": "Went for a lunch and had the 'Love Boat' soup and the Pork Belly Steamed Buns. Both were very full of flavor, not timid at all. The steamed buns had a great pork in it, very tender and flavorful. A fresh chopped herb, pickle, and sliced jalepeno topping accompanying the pork, which helped balance and brighten the overall taste. The soup was moderately spicy and heavy on the cilantro (I love it, but be warned if you don't). Plenty of meat and noodles, it was fairly hardy as far as asian soups go. I wish there was more broth, I could have drank a huge bowl of it. They could probably lose the chitlins they put on top. I like the idea, but they were a little bit chewy and not very flavorful. Overall, would get both again.  I agree with the other review that said the portion sizes were a bit uneven. The more expensive dishes don't really seem to be proportionally sized. Overall, the portions are medium-sized. You won't be stuffed after you leave, but the two dishes I had kept me full until dinner.",

Noodlehead was my first experience with Thai food, and even though I've found that I don't care for it, I had a great experience, and would recommend to others. (For those who don't like thai food, I recommend the Spring Rolls and the Thai Fried Chicken). Great quality, great portion, great price. Everything was under $10. The restaurant is BYOB. Our server was great, very friendly. Food came fast, but we waited at least 45 minutes to be seated on a Friday night. I loved the atsmophere- cool and trendy but can also be intimate and romantic. I could see myself going here with family, friends, or a partner. I ordered the street noodle and ordered it at a 2/5 spiciness, and just so you know, it is still SUPER spicy. At each table they have a pitcher of water so you can just serve yourself water and they also have silverware and chopsticks presented in a beautiful way. Very clean and nice.",

But despite their noodle soup nazi ways, it's worth it to stop in if you have time to sit down and enjoy the ambiance that has been created.  It's a lovely wooden room with unique lighting and decor.  The tables range in comfort level, the chairs that accompany the bench along the wall are definitely too high for the tiny tables, but this is Thai street food so comfort isn't exactly part of the theme.  I like to sit at the bar that looks out the window.  I've tried almost the whole menu, it's all flawless.  I sort of get why they don't do substitutions, but just once I want to have the shrimp tempura on the other rice noodle dish, maybe some day. Every dish is bursting with so much flavor, it really leaves everywhere comparable in the dust on that front.  The ground pork in a spicy lime broth, is one of the smaller bowls but to me, that is the perfect soup meal.  I'm obsessed.",

We shared the Sweet & Spicy Pig Wings to start, which were a bit spicy, a bit sweet, very tender, and finished with cilantro and green onions.  Delicious.  Next, at the suggestion of our server, I had the Slow Cooked Beef.  Again, delicious.  The broth was sweet and extremely flavorful.  There was garlic, spice, and cilantro in addition to the tender cubes of beef in every bite.  I ordered it to be a 3 and was happy with the spice although I am admittedly a bit of a wuss.  My friend had the Sukothai and Loveboat and was pleased with both.  She thought that the dishes could use more spice (and she ordered them at a 5) but she's pretty hard core.  I can't wait to go back to Noodlehead to try everything that I didn't have on the menu.  It's inexpensive, delicious, and $0.50/person for BYOB.",

They were really tender and came with marinated cucumber, which complemented the pork really well. The flavor was a little muted, but I would still order them again. For the meals, I ordered the street noodles #2 (shrimp tempura and thin noodles) and my boyfriend ordered the street noodles #1 (fried chicken with pad thai style nooodles). The sauces tasted extremely similar if not the same, which was fine because it had a nice spicy flavor. We requested a medium level of spicy and my mouth was on fire by the end- beware! The tempura dipped in the leftover noodle sauce was my favorite part of the meal. The crispiness balanced the spicy very well. I wouldn't recommend these dishes if you think you'll have leftovers. They don't travel very well! Finally, the service was great. We asked our waitress for recommendations (as we do at most places--you would be surprised at how many servers this question trips up!). She gave great recommendations and was helpful!",

    "text": "Great authentic Thai noodles! I've been a few times now and will definitely return. Yes, the $9 price tag seems like a lot, but not in comparison to other Asian restaurants in the area. You're paying for the convenience, but it's definitely worth it. I've had street noodles 1 and 2 and kee mao, which is basically drunken noodle that I've gotten from many other Thai places. It's delicious but too similar to other dishes I've had and loved before. I'm going back for the street noodles, which are totally new dishes for me. They are sweet and spicy, my favorite combination. The fried chicken was fantastic; it was crispy but moist, tender, and not greasy at all. Definitely my favorite dish so far. My husband got the sukothai and pork buns, which he loved. We're definitely returning for those dishes.  Yes, it is cash only. No, they don't have a phone. Yes, you can get takeout. Just show up and order. Dishes are made fresh and only take about 5 minutes to prepare. Our server told us that cash only and no phone were meant to keep costs down, especially important in such a high rent area.   Overall, I definitely recommend visiting. I didn't care for the last two Thai places in this location, mostly due to the mediocre food and high cost (much more so than noodlehead). Noodlehead's opening was a pleasant surprise, and I can't wait to visit again.",

I crave the warm spicy broth of Sukothai on cool winter nights, and Chiang Mai noodles are decadent but so worth it. The Pad Thai, although not the best I've had in Pittsburgh, is still pretty good. The one dish I've had no luck with is the Street Noodles made with tempura shrimp. The noodles were all clumped together, and although I ordered a spicy level of 2, it was so hot it was almost unpalatable. I love spicy food, but the highest I ever go is a 4 because this food is HOT. The ambiance is sophisticated yet laid back, and the service is usually quick, even when they're busy. The prices are amazing- for $9, I get a dish that can easily last me 2, if not 3, meals.  If you're looking for delicious, warm, spicy, Thai noodles, then look no further. Noodlehead will not disappoint.",

It is a limited menu, but I have never been disappointed.  To address a few nuiances of this place: 1.  BYOB is 50 cents per person.  Love this aspect (other places in Shadyside also do this). 2.  Cash only.  Yes, it's 2014 and yes, you can get credit card charging apps.  That's not the issue.  This is a small, local place that does not wish to pay the fee every time a credit card is used, simple as that.  One way for them to reduce costs.  They have an ATM...so you can pay the ATM fee if you don't have cash lol. 3.  The host is a kind gentleman who is always working and does a great job.  My husband and I come in almost once weekly for carry-out, and he never misses a beat.  I know what a previous poster means about a little off, maybe he's on the spectrum?  Regardless, he is efficient at his job and always pleasant. 4.  Spice level - seriously spicy folks!  I'm a middle of the road kind of person, and I can only do a 2/5 on a good day when I want some serious spice.  It is amusing to watch a newbie go on to his (usually it's a douchey college guy) friends about how he loves spice yada yada, and then is unable to finish his meal.  I have witnessed this 3 times since the fall, always makes me chuckle.",

We chose a level 2 on the 1-5 chart for everthing, which was still pretty spicy. We started with the belly buns, pig wings and Thai fried chicken. The belly buns were wonderful and flavorful. Soft buns with awesome pork balanced with clean crisp radish. The pork wings were great to spicy sweet tender the are worth going back. The Thai chicken was good but couldn't compete with the more flavorful  dishes.  We had the loveboat soup, which was the most spicy dish of the night. The thin spicy broth and thin rice noodles with ample veggies is the type of soup that builds in heat as you eat but is too good to put down.  We moved on to the street noodle 1, chaing mai curry, and the yee saw. Street noodle 1, with its generous portion of Thai fried chicken was clean and spicy. The chaing mai was my favorite dish of the night. The tender chicken and twisting noodle were lovingly drenched in a warmingly hot, creamy delish yellow curry sauce. The yee saw was very good spicy sweet and I loved the big chewy noodles.  I would say this place with its great atmosphere, great food, and great service is a great date spot. The above meal ran 70.00 but the portions were large and easy to share. As far as beer I would suggest stay away from IPA'S and Stouts. Any clean belgain or American lager, euro pilsner or even a light corona would work well.",

I would have enjoyed more crushed peanuts as I believe that truly makes the pad Thai. The flavor was good, but the sauce was overwhelming as I went through the dish.

On some visits I'm happy with the taste, and on others I'm kind of \"meh\" about it. Also, the spice level seems highly variable -- sometimes spicy enough to require lots of water, and sometimes barely spicy at all. Yesterday for example I ordered \"thai hot\" and it was more like \" American mild.\"  Still, the steamed pork buns are always a favorite, and the Sukothai soup is quite nice. I have gotten tired of the Pad Thai, and the Kee Mao which used to be my favorite did not impress last time.  Although I still like this place and find their prices reasonable, I think they lack consistency and hence deserve a slightly lower rating.  Note: cash only, no reservations, no telephone number to call. They do have take-out, but you need to order it in person.",

Prices are very reasonable, everything under $9.   The pork belly buns were just divine with the combination of savory, sweet, tangy, fluffy and crunch. Definitely a must try! I also really enjoyed the street noodle #1 (with crispy chicken tempura and slightly vinegary sauce), chiang mai curry (which was rich and creamy), and the kee mao (flat rice noodles in a sweet, tangy basil sauce).   I highly recommend Noodlehead! They have a small menu, but it's very well put together. Two things to keep in mind though: CASH ONLY, and beware of their spice level. It's on a scale of 1-5, but their spicy might be spicier than you think (dun dun dunnnnnn...!)",

Most of my friends love the Pad Thai but I'm generally not a Phad Thai lover.   The Pork Belly Steames Buns is a mist try appetizer if you are getting an appetizer.  They ask you for your prefered level of spicyness. If you are generally not a spicy food fan, ask for a zero and ask them to being the spice on the side. Beside the spices, they have a special res spicy sauce that is some what sweet and spicy. Ask for that as well. Its definitely worth it. But, for most people I know a level 2 is just great. Its spicy enough whole you still notice the taste of the ingredients :)  Make sure to go early on Fridays and weekends it can have a great line and especially aince the close early you might have the greatest experience if your are there close to their closing time.",

    "text": "SETTING: Modern decor with dark colors, subtle asian themes, wooden panels. Dimly lit. Casual.    FOOD: Pork belly steamed buns (appetizer) and Street noodles #1 (entree)  While waiting in a long line, I noticed a few tables with pork belly steamed buns. Intrigued, I honed in on one particular table and watched intently as the group of friends happily nibbled on the appetizer. It's easy to spot genuine happiness. You know, the \"I-don't-care-how-goofy-I look\" signature smile that spans from ear to ear?   When we finally got seated, we knew we had to order them buns (each order comes with 2 buns). I asked the waiter for napkins, but after 5 minutes of waiting, I caved. I knew it was going to be a bit messy. The first bite was all I needed to do my best impression of that same goofy smile...and more. A tangy and spicy orange sauce graced the ends of my mouth. Never have I looked more handsome-- 'sup, ladies. The chilled cucumbers complimented the warm and tender pulled pork well. It's worth noting that this version of the pork belly bun is different in that the meat is actually pulled pork, and not the chunk of pork belly that is usually served with these kinds of buns. Different, and still delicious.    Street noodle #1. Number one in its name and number one in my stomach. Fried chicken with flat noodles, bok choy, cilantro. The generous amounts of fried chicken was definitely a plus! Nothing makes me more mad than when restaurants skimp on the meat. Sauce was not too overpowering, but it was a bit spicier than the \"medium\" I imagined it to be, so be aware when deciding your heat level. I wished there was a bit more bok choy though to balance things out. Solid entree, would recommend. Portion was perfectly sized that would leave you comfortably full.   SERVICE: It was okay, mostly due to long wait time. Noodlehead is definitely a busy place and the amount of staff is not enough to cater to their volume of customers. Though not painfully slow by any means, it did take a little while to get our napkins, takeout box, and check. Turnover/cleanup was took time. I felt bad just sitting there waiting for our check while the tons of people at the door waiting to be seated had to be patient minutes longer.  Staff was polite and the food came out fast enough though, so kudos! It's not easy feeding large groups of hangry people.  IMPRESSIONS: Price is absolutely affordable for the quality and quantity of food. I've been here about three times now, and look forward to coming back again. It is cash only, so that's kind of a small annoyance. Plan accordingly...and I hope you think of the infamous sir mix-a-lot song when you order the buns (juicy doubles). Is it playing in your head already? Perfect.",

Very beautiful interior.  The menu was small and simple. My friend got the street noodle #1 and I got the pad Thai! I loved the pad Thai! Very good and his street noodles seemed delectable but not as good!  Appetizer I got was the sliced beef which was real juicy with a kick!  The waiter was pretty attentive bringing bottles of water soon after we finished. The only complaint I had was the 15 minutes we waited for him to take the check back- not a big deal but it was kind of long- especially because they weren't busy.   Overall really good dining experience! 4.5 stars. Will return! Remember it is byob and a cash only business.",

I had to fight for my seat at one point because there was another person with the same name waiting and since I had been waiting outside for 40 minutes, rather than inside, she thought the other person who had been waiting inside for 10 minutes was the person who had been there for longer. Once I got my seat, the server than made a snarky comment and the dinner was then ruined by more terrible service. I really like the food, but I would much rather pay to be treated with some decency than go to this place. Don't go during a weekend night or Friday night.",

    "text": "I eat here fairly often, because I enjoy spicy Thai noodles, and I almost always order the See Yew with tofu, which is delicious. What I feel sets this place apart is that I can freely ask for \"no fish sauce\" (since I am a vegetarian), and they happily accommodate. I understand that there are probably more authentic Thai places out there, but not all of them are so understanding of my desire not to consume fish products.  I also like that it's BYOB, and I don't mind the cash-only rule. Every time I've gone, they've been super chill about splitting the bill.  A couple downsides (that keep it from getting 5 stars):  1. They don't allow for call-aheads or reservations and it can get pretty busy. I hate waiting (sometimes the wait is over an hour) so I only eat here for a late lunch (like 2ish).  2. The spice level is somewhat inconsistent. I tried every spice level up to 4 before finally deciding on 3. Some days that 3 tastes more like a 2, and others more like a 4 or 4.5! Just a heads up so you don't accidentally order something too spicy to eat.",

    "text": "Recently moved into the neighborhood and decided to finally give Noodlehead a try.  On entrance, I absolutely loved the atmosphere as it is very homey with its wooden tables/ decor and tons of plant life.  The waitress was very helpful in terms of indicating what could and could not be made gluten free.   If you have celiac disease, all appetizers along with two of the main dishes are a no go.  Also, again if you have celiac disease its probably best to avoid the tofu as it is not fried in a dedicated fryer.  However, once you get past that you realize that most of the noodle dishes can be made gluten free; indeed, they are more than happy to sub-in the rice noodle for lets say the egg noddle etc.   Personally, for my first (hopefully of many) visit I kept it simple with the gluten free chicken pad thai, with a spice level of 1.  It was delicious, but make no mistake this place is serious about spice.  Though usually I am apt to get a 7/10 in other thai places and then add on hot sauce or sriracha without issue... Noodlehead's spice level 1 of 5 came close to making my eyes water. I kind of wish that the pad thai would have involved a few more veggies... but that's defs a personal preference.  Overall this place gets full marks for atmosphere and willingness to accommodate little gluten free me. The only possible detractor from this restaurant is that it is indeed a cash only establishment, and if you want take out....well you will need to stop by as they have no phones.  That being said, worst case they have an atm in the back.  It is definitely worth a shot and I will definitely be back :D",

It is also BYOB and cash only. These frustrating aspects do not dampen the experience though!  The menu has been the same for as long as I can remember. Each noodle dish has an option of protein and spicy level. They recently changed their spicy level to even spicier than before, and it is 0 through 5. 5 is Thai level spicy. Occasionally the sauces have fish in them, so vegetarians that care must state to their waiter they want the alternative sauce. I usually always get the Kee Mao with tofu. I used to get it spicy level 1, for just the right little kick, but since then I switched it to zero. I get a little dish of spice on the side so I can add as much as I want. The Kee Mao has wide noodles, bok choy and basil (and tofu). Simple and absolutely delicious.",

The fried chicken is so tasty that it's an appetizer that can be eaten as a meal if you have someone in the group who thinks they don't like Thai, like my kids. I had the kee mao the first time I was here. It was good but it's my favorite dish at two other places so it wasn't something I was super excited about. On my second visit we split the street noodles #1 and street noodles #2. With both meals I was way more enthusiastic. We got both with medium heat, 2 on the spice level, and it was an easy heat that added a nice level without taking away from the delicious flavors. The portions are a perfect size; we finished our food and left pleasantly and comfortably full.  Everything is $9 and under but the decor/design doesn't feel discount. BYOB, which I like, and they serve Mexican Coke. Not sure I'd show up with a large group because they don't take reservations, however, there's a nice choice of places to keep busy during a wait so it can be done.",

    "text": "Definitely one of my favorite Thai joints in Pittsburgh.    The food is FANTASTIC 5/5! There are so many dishes that are flavorful and savory. They really bring back the memories of my time in Southeast Asia.   If you're more adventerous i'd stay stray away from the more well known dishes like pad thai and try something authentic.  Top recommendations would have to be \"street noodle number 1\" and the  \"sukothai\".  The one fantastic thing about local restaurants is that the ingredients and taste almost always taste the same. They're smaller so they really put alot of care and interest in making their cuisine the same every time.   oh yes, it's BYOB, another thing I love about Pittsburgh.   Ambience 5/5 Absolute LOVE the ambience and decor.  It's incredibly chic and modern, but not overly pretentious.  It has that hipster feel to it (Lol Sorry didn't know how else to describe it).  It's designed to handle some big parties, small parties or if you'd just like to dine by yourself.  It's family friendly but most of the time it's usually mid-20s that I see go there.    Service 3.5/5 Staff is nice, but don't expect fine dining service. They don't have a phone, so you have to go there to be able to order. I get that it's a part of the whole \"street style\" and \"hawkers\" theme, but I must say, it's a little bit inconvenient sometimes.  Oh yes, and the portions are very generous for the price that they charge.  Ranging from $6-$13 I believe.  Can't beat that for quality food and service!",

    "text": "First and foremost this restaurant is neatly situated in the heart of ShadySide and easy to get to no matter what part of the city your coming from.  Parking may be a little bit of a pain on the weekends but it's worth the little walk if you park a couple blocks away.  Secondly, the ambiance nice and not to classy where you feel out of place.  I can walk in under dressed and fit right in.  It's just under 1200 sq feet I think but conveniently laid out to accompany all size parties.   With 3 decent size tables out front on the sidewalk, it's a plus when they get slammed and have a line going down the sidewalk. Third, the staff is always warm and welcoming.  They probably have a huge staff because every time I come in, I always meet someone new.  They are also very knowledgable of the menu and can help first timers order.  Just be careful with the Spicy/Hotness scale. It goes from 1 being mild to 5 which is their hottest.  I can eat spicy food and 2 is pushing the limit for me. Lastly, the food...simply amazing no matter what you order.  Being a world traveler and having eaten in just about every Asian country, this spot is one to contend with.   I absolutely love and must have the pulled pork buns every time I visit.  It reminds me of how Peeking Duck is served but only with ridiculously moist and soft pulled pork wrapped in cloudy white bun.  My other favorites are the Sokutai and Chang Mai Curry noodles, each with its own special ties to Asia. In conclusion, when in Pittsburgh you have to visit this spot!  Why anyone would give it anything less than 4 stars is besides me....Very well done Noodle Head!",

First off, the pulled pork belly steamed buns definitely live up to their reputation; while a tad expensive at $3 a piece, they are so worth it! The buns are soft, while the filling is extremely tasty and tender. That itself blew us away, even before the entrees.  Friend and I ordered two different noodles, the Street Noodle #1 and the See Yew. The Street Noodle is a rice noodle, and they do it differently from most other places (mostly Chinese) that I've eaten at. It's somewhat fried but not completely; in any case, it's very tasty, but I would recommend getting this dish just for the fried chicken. Its skin is crispy and the meat inside isn't dry at all, which was a bit surprising.  The See Yew is more of your traditional Thai type of noodle, which is wide and flat (like pad thai). The chicken that this one came with was not as interesting as the other one, but this dish as a whole was still very good nonetheless.",

    "text": "Have never been here before and my friends had mentioned it before so I decided to check it out. Went and ordered one of the review highlights, the Chiang Mai Curry with the highest advertised spiciness rating of 5. My thoughts of the dish? I didn't really find it to be very spicy at all, seeing as I had no tearing up in my eyes at all throughout eating it. I had to use some sriracha and dump a full cup's worth of red chili peppers into my dish before finding it to be minimally pleasing in terms of spiciness level. Although the rest of the dish was okay with the pickled mustard greens, shallots, and yellow curry coconut milk sauce, it really did not taste too much like curry (which is supposed to be spicy in and of itself) so the dish ended up being a bit bland. As for the chicken, I personally thought that it was a tad bit too dry (overcooked) so they could definitely do a better job on that. Overall, it was an okay joint. After paying, I was told by my server that there was a secret spicy level \"6\" ... well, it may have been more appropriate to tell me that before I ordered (just a thought).  Cash only so be prepared by bringing cash beforehand so you don't have to pay the lousy ATM fee for using the joint's onsite ATM in the establishment. In general, I've had better Thai in Pittsburgh, including Smiling Banana Leaf & Pittsburgh Thai by Boris so I'd probably choose these two over this joint. I might come back to try their level 6 spiciness level on a different dish down the road, but other than that I don't really have much motivation to return.",

While there's always a wait for groups in the evenings, couples don't seem to have to wait long (if at all) getting a table for two.   As most have mentioned, the spice level is much more intense than your average Pittsburgh Thai place. We order on the low end (2) then add their chili sauce to kick it up if necessary.  Service is great. Cash only. You can get take out, but have to order there and wait for it (no phone number).   Our opinion, a nice IPA is a perfect compliment to their menu. Enjoy!",

This is one of the few Thai restaurants that stays True to their spice scale- a \"medium hot\" spicy level would be the equivalent to a \"level 10\" spice elsewhere, so to all of you spice lovers: scale back and order accordingly!

    "text": "Why do people like BYOB? That's like saying here you do our job for us.   Saw the great reviews figured I'd give it a try. I love asian fusion places and this thai inspired place looked great. Plus it was right next to Oh Yeah Ice cream, and you know I love my ice cream.  So we walked in waited for a couple minutes and realized there was no hostess. I saw the sign that said cash only and had to leave to hit up the ATM! It's the 21st century! Time to upgrade and get a credit card reader. When I came back in we were seated immediately only to find out i was going to sit on a tiny wooden stool for up to an hour while my friend got to sit on a comfy couch? I get theres an ambiance and eclectic design they were trying to have but jeez, at least give me the option of a more comfortable chair while I dine.  The 2 waiters over there looked swamped. They need busboys/ hostesses. It's ridiculous to have 2 waiters do all that work especially for dinner. The menu as indicated was very short which isn't a problem but when all the option look the same and just variations of the other ones there really isn't much to eat. I got the pork buns which were great. Soft and savory with a slight hint of sweet. I also got the soup which was very good as well. I liked the hot and spicy effects with the cool broth and delicious chips on the side.   For the main course my friend got sew yew which looked nothing like the description but it was basically beef chow fun. Tasty but a little too much pepper if you ask me. I got street noodles #1 at a hot level of 3 and the guy warned me that that was very very hot. I obliged saying I could take the heat. When our meal came out I was immediately turned off just by the smell. It smelled like old leather boots and when you bit into the noodles they tasted of nasty rank vegetables. They needed soy sauce or sweet sauce to calm the food down.  Now I can eat anything. You can ask my friends but I eat everything under the sun. This is the first dish ever that I simply had to push away and could not eat. I told the waiter it was bad and his response was \"well other people eat it\" asked if I would like anything else but I simply could not eat anything else. Even when he removed the dish the smell lingered and I was grossed out.   The waiter came back cleaned off our dishes and let us sit there for another 10 minutes. Why didn't he just bring us the check? When he did return he did not charge me for my meal which i did not eat. I put my money down and we sat for another 10 minutes. I waited for my date to use the bathroom and she said someone had left a green mess in the toilet that no one cleaned which grossed me even more out.   I will not be returning. The service is too slow, cash only and BYOB is BS, no parking (plus the bridge is out) and the food was marginal with that one dish being simply disgusting.",

    "text": "Every time I visit this restaurant I am again reminded of how fantastic the menu is. For a surprisingly small and somewhat simple menu, they offer a lot of diversity. The appetizer portions are modest, especially for the price, but they are exceptionally done. I highly recommend the pork wings - their taste and presentation are simply wonderful!  The decor is stunning -- rustic barn meets urban chic loft. Their complication of seating, that includes a lot of benches and stools are still surprisingly comfortable even if you linger for a while. The outdoor seating is sparse, as it is limited to the sidewalk, but it's still enjoyable, especially in off-peak hours.   Bring your dollars, as this is cash only. Might as well bring some wine, as it's also BYOB. Take out is enjoyable and relatively speedy, even when the restaurant is packed. However, the presentation and perhaps even quantity, is greater if you dine in. I've never been able to stray from the curry dish when I order, but seeing other items on the menu tell me that there is no bad choice on the menu.  And with each main dish being $9, you really do get a lot of bang for your buck in that aspect.  All in all, this place is a joy and highly recommended!",

I thought they had the perfect amount of spiciness paired with sweetness (I got level 1 spiciness). The chicken, egg, and veggies in my noodles were well cooked and I only wish there was more on my plate haha. They aren't kidding when they talk about the level of spice. My date got his pad thai at a spiciness of 3 and he said it was super spicy. It's BYOB with a  .50 charge per person and the meal was super cheap. My only regret is that I didn't get the pork buns as an appetizer because they looked absolutely delicious! Note, that this restaurant only accepts cash but they do have an ATM on site in case you forget :) The atmosphere is great, the food is spectacular, and I will definitely be back for Round 2 soon!",

The wait time was about 20 minutes and the restaurant is cash only but they have an ATM in the back. I took off one star because they don't have a phone (so you can't call ahead to order and then pick up, you have to drive to the restaurant and make the order in person to carry out) and they also don't serve any thai iced tea.

    "text": "I love Noodlehead; the food, the atmosphere, the decor...everything. For me it's a beginner's guide to Thai food, although I will be the first to admit I know NOTHING about authentic Thai food. It could be spot on original for all I know. What I do know is that it's yummy goodness. I not super big on the soups, but mainly because when I am there I want the Pad Thai; my favorite. Their spicy scale is only 1-5, where I am used to the more normal 1-10, but don't let that confuse you; Their 5 is hothothot!  I think I have had almost everything there and it's all very good. The pork buns are de-lish, as well as the Thai fried chicken.  I even love the \"no phone, no credit cards and no reservations\", even though there are times I wish they participated in all three.   Which brings me to the 'the more you know' portion of our program... There is no phone. You cannot call for hours, take-out, or reservations, which they don't take anyways. They are cash only. They do not take credit/debit cards, but there is an ATM in the back.  They are BYOB with a small bottle fee.  I think $.50 or something. I don't drink so I could be off on that number, so please do not quote me.  The menu is small- a few noodle soups, a few noodles and some appetizers. Not extensive but all good. My favorite part of the menu though is the pricing; everything is $6 or $9. I don't know why I love that so much, but I do. It's another neat aspect of this place.  There are a few outside tables which fill up fast (as does the restaurant itself).  Al in all it's a great little neighborhood place with great food, great atmosphere and decently priced. What more can you ask for???",

Some of the tables are unique and very interesting - overall, a very pleasant decor.     Here are some things to know... - It's cash only - come prepared!   The place is very reasonably priced, with most dishes $9 or less, but still - good to know in advance.   - The pork belly steamed buns are a must.   Tender and delicious - some of the best I have had.    - Pay attention when the waiter describes the spice levels.   I ordered the Street Noodles #1 in a level 2 (out of 5 levels).  It was perfect - spicy and flavorful, without being firey burning hot.  I normally would have gone with a 3 or 4, but was forewarned that they are serious about their Thai spices here.  My companion (who had previously tried the level 2) wimped out with a level zero this time and loved it.    - BYOB, with a super reasonable corkage fee of 50 cents per person. - The place is busy every night of the week, so be prepared to wait.   No reservations.  - There is no parking.  A lot of the nearby street spots are permit only, so be prepared to walk a bit.   And don't try parking down the street near the wine store - even though I went in and bought a bottle of wine first, they wouldn't let me walk out of the parking lot and leave my car there.   My only real critique of the place is that almost ALL of their seating is stools.   Backless stools.  Oh how I despise this creation.   I almost knocked a star off, but since I got a banquet seat (merely by chance), I was feeling generous.",

Luckily, we have Noodlehead (still the Thai place that was already there, now improved). For under $25 bucks, we get two meals (which we always take almost half of home for lunch the next day) of really well made Thai food that happens to be in a BYOB, casual but cool place that's a block away.. in an eastern Pittsburgh neighborhood. If you don't know, the premise itself for that to exist is incredible.   This place is 4 stars for the food--I'm a loser and am stuck on the pad thai or street noodle #1 (Thai fried chicken!!!), but my +1 always gets something different and has never been unhappy--which is incredible, \"atmosphere\" (it just looks cute), and service. Four stars in one sentence. Sheesh.  The 5th star is for how easily we can get here, get food, and get on with our evening .. or hang out with our (cheeeeap corkage fee'd) bottles. I'm not saying sometimes there isn't a half hour wait. If you're going during typical dinner hours, put your name in, go grab wine at the W&S a block away, and get ready for pounds of noodles.",

We were super hungry after running errands all day, and looking forward to trying a new place. The hostess immediately barked at us that should COULDN'T seat us until our \"entire party\" was present (As if this were some fancy establishment with a line out the door)... I perused a paper menu and my son was quiet, but getting a bit restless.  Did I mention that I'm pretty noticeably pregnant? The entry to the dark restaurant is tiny and cramped, with no place to sit. Did they really want my son, my belly and I to block the doorway for any other potential patrons? When my husband arrived at the door, our son went out to greet him, and seeing a few open tables (simple metal bistro style tables, mind you, not fancy white tablecloths) on the covered patio, they took a seat. I told the hostess that my husband had arrived and we'd like to sit outside if that was okay. The hostess said it looked like it was about to rain and would have to \"ask.\" She came back a few minutes later and said she couldn't seat us outside due to a forecast of rain, and I'd have to have \"the rest of my party\" come back inside before she would get us a table. First of all, when does it not look like it's going to rain in Pittsburgh, and secondly, other people had just been served outside. I've dined at restaurants from Manhattan to Milan and never been refused a table - especially not for such a reason on a slow Sunday afternoon. We went someplace less snobby, and thoroughly enjoyed eating outside on a warm day after a long winter. We won't go back to Noodlehead until that hostess gets her nose out of the air - and management has had a turnover as well - because they know nothing about service :)",

We had both the smaller noodles ---SOKUTHAI and LOVE BOAT which were both extremely tasty and flavorful.  We had the CHIANG MAI CURRY noodles which has crunch noodles on the top and a rich curry broth.  Spice can range from 0-5 for all the noodles.  The service was quick and attentive.  The atmosphere good for all needs---a quick bite in, an intimate date, or a group of friends.  Nice and full on a Monday night, I have a feeling this place is going to take off so get a seat now!  We will definitely be back as I am already craving for the next bowl.",

Wait time is average on a busy Friday night, but the service was fast. No sooner than I ordered, my appetizer came. Pulled pork sticky buns, I think, delicious. Then without hesitation my curry dish came. Medium spicy was on point, just enough for me to handle. So good I kept the remaining sauce to have later over rice! I will definitely visit again and refer people to this place. P. S. cash only",

    "text": "I usually shy away from Thai cuisine. Yes, there is a reason. I find most Thai restaurants to be completely predictable. Everyone sticks to the same traditional dishes, never daring to lean slightly to the left or right. Quite frankly, I've become bored of it all.   Noodlehead has given Thai new life. The rustic barnyard decor, the modern take on traditional dishes; Is that green curry linguine? Fried chicken noodles? Yep, this is what creativity looks and tastes like.   Food: Pork bun - A warm pillowy soft bun, but rather than pork belly, the chefs have chosen to go with pulled pork. The pickles and cilantro come through just enough to give a perfect balance. I must admit I am never a fan of pulled pork, but I'll eat these all day!   Chiang Mai curry - the most popular item on the menu, and with good reason. A hefty bowl of noodles, chicken, crispy shallots, yellow curry.... Simply delicious   Tip: For noodle dishes, you get to choose your heat level. I'd go no higher than medium. You've been warned!   Noodlehead is a breath of fresh air. This is like your Thai grandmother finding the fountain of millennial youth. Except the cash only policy. I'm sorry, that's older than even your great grandma.....",

    "text": "I have had Noodlehead bookmarked for years now.  I remember seeing people's pictures of their food and thinking I want to eat there so bad.  This is primarily because I am a rice noodle fan and love Thai food.  However I never seemed to find myself here until recently when we were out in Shadyside watching some Pens playoff game at a bar that didn't serve food.  This was a sign.  Others were tempted to order pizza, but a light bulb went off in my head and I was determined to try Noodlehead.  So a couple of things.  They don't have a phone.  I don't know if this is entirely True but if they do have one you can't have the number.  So if you want to grab some takeout you have to go there and order at the counter, to which they do not take cards.  ATM inside and good thing.  After you pay you have to wait in the overcrowded store front for someone to call your order.  The employees do a good job of herding everyone to appropriate areas.   Our food was called and we headed back to the bar to enjoy some noodles and hockey.  I ordered the Kee Mao, big flat rice noodles, bok choy, spicy chili garlic sauce, with shrimp spice level of 4/5.  I also opted to order the Pork Belly Steamed Buns.  Let me say, they don't mess around with the spices here.  If you think you can handle a five, just try a four.  I love spicy food and thought the same, but now after getting a 4, I know a 5 would be way too much heat.  The dish however was fabulous.  I absolutely loved the noodles and the sauce with the crunchy bok choy.  My husband and friend also really liked their meals.  The disappointment was with the steamed buns.  I can't believe those beautifully pictured buns were just so underwhelming.  I found them to be really sweet, and the bun to be a little on hard side, not soft like a steamed bun.  They were very sticky too, just way too much sugar in the sauce.    Overall great meal, and I'm looking forward trying some of their other offerings soon.",

I've tried many Thai places and I have to say, this is definitely ranking in my top 3 spots! Too bad it's so far away from home...BOOHOO. Lucky you guys, Pittsburgh!   Pro tip 1: your whole party has to be there to be seated...this place is always poppin', so it makes sense that they reinforce that!  Pro tip 2: You can BYOB?! (Is that a PA thing...?) Cool cool. I saw people just poppin' bottles of champagne for lunch!  Pro tip 3: parking lot at the little plaza right by Chipotle/Pure Barre/Fine Wines. Walk over!   TLDR;  Menu: 5/5 simple, clean and crisp. Vegetarians welcome, carnivores especially welcomed.   Ambiance: 4/5 A little dark in some areas, but definitely a great spot for all ages.   Quality: 5/5 For what you're paying, this is just as good (or even better) than places that make you pay 1.5x/2x!   Quantity: 4/5 Definitely enough to be 70% full.   S/O to Martin X. for taking me here! We ordered:  SNACKS 1) Pulled pork belly steamed buns ($6) // DELICIOUS!!! Must get. Everyone is literally getting this. Comes with 2 steamed buns!   NOODLES: 1) Chiang Mai Curry ($9) // I recommend medium spicy if you want to be safe, but go spicier if you're a hot shot! :P  +1 Curry is delicious! I need some rice with this...seriously.  +Noodles were perfect! Comes with fried noodles on top too for garnish.   MORE NOODLES: 1) Kee Mao ($9) // Don't forget to pick your protein! (tofu, chicken, or pork) +1 Balanced blend of vegetables, protein and noodles!  +1 Not too salty..thank goodness.   Overall, amazing spot for a quick lunch! Service is efficient and ambiance is great. It's nice that they keep the menu short, because they specialize and highlight only on certain dishes. I can totally see this being a food truck....gahhhhh. Come to CA!",

    "text": "When people ask me what restaurant is a MUST in Pittsburgh when they visit, I always recommend Noodlehead. It's been one of my favorite Thai restaurants since my freshman year. And it's pretty easy to get to by riding a 71B.   The interior is pretty hip and the servers are always very welcoming. My go-to is usually the Pad See Yew or the Pad Kee Mao with spice level 3. I don't really know how well to describe their food because it's just that good. Not too greasy or sweet. Their pork belly steamed buns are a delicious addition as well! One order comes with two so it's perfect to share with another person. Another recent favorite has become the Street Noodle #1 dish. My first experience with it was that it was too sweet for my taste but I kept giving it another try and it's become another one of my go-to's. The Thai chicken that comes with that dish is tender on the inside and crispy on the outside.   The only downside may be that it's cash only here but that doesn't stop me from coming :)   Also! After dining here, most people head over next door to Millie's Homemade Icecream. But that's for another review",

I have been here way more often than I should, but it is so so worth it in terms price and quality. Though on a sweeter, Americanized side, it is as close to authentic as it gets in PGH. Still not convinced? Here's THE testimonial: I once took my Thai mother, who is a phenomenal cook and 10x pickier than I am, to this established and she *strongly* approved.   As for the spice levels, if you absolutely cannot handle spicy, ask for a 1 or even a 0 - my soul hurts saying this. After years of eating painfully spicy food, my capsaicin receptors have been desensitized to the point where a 2 won't do it for me, so I typically go for a 3 or a 4 if I feel like challenging myself.   Recipe for a happy life: go there, get their pork belly steamed buns (DO IT), try any of their somewhat underrated $6 noodle soups or their more popular $9 noodles, pay/tip them (cash only), and walk out a happy man/woman.",

The name sort of implies that it's a ramen place, or one of those trendy new places were the noodles are made on site.  If you went by that assumption you might be very disappointed.  They serve fast Thai food, but just gave it the name Noodlehead because they thought it was catchy I guess.  I would say that it is good if you are in the mood for a quick bite of Thai style noodles dishes.  I don't know about you, but I get in this type of mood quite often.  For how quickly they make it I think the quality is pretty high.  It says on their website that they are inspired by the street markets of Thailand, ahhhhh.  I did notice that our dishes were a little bit greasy, but they tasted good and the service was very good.  I like the way the restaurant looks, it has got a modern rustic look, sort of old meets new vibe.  It is always packed it seems, so just be ready for the hustle and bustle.  It does provide a sort of electric energy which is nice.  It is certainly worth a try.",

They do have an ATM on site if need be.  She told me that the noodle portions were quite generous so I decided to stick with two small appetizers and chat with a few folks around me over their selections.  They serve all types of noodle dishes including noodle soup with the only substitution being tofu for whatever meat or seafood on it.  I ordered the crispy veggie spring rolls and the sweet potato triangles. I got two spring rolls with a sauce and about six sweet potatoes with a cut up cucumber based sauce. You have your choice of silverware or chop sticks if you wish to try your hand at that. I enjoyed both appetizers and was glad they were not overly filling.  One of the persons I chatted with ordered the Kee Mao with chicken. This dish includes flat rice noodles, bok choy, basil, and spicy chili sauce. She loved it and told me it was her go to meal whenever she comes here. Another person I spoke to had the pulled pork belly steam buns. He told me it was his favorite appetizer.  I was impressed with the menu because it even notes your choice of spice level. The menu is clearcut and straight forward.   This place definitely will be on my return bucket list to try out one of their noodle dishes. The place fills up quickly so it is best to get there early.",

Menu is short and sweet, not overwhelming unlike other restaurant menus.   My only qualm with this restaurant is that they are cash only and don't have a phone number, so it's impossible to call ahead to make a reservation or see how long the wait could be. Yet to wait for this restaurant is always at least 30 minutes sometimes even an hour if you're with a bigger group especially during peak hours.",

But, after taking a detour through Pittsburgh this past weekend, my spouse and I popped in on a whim for lunch. It lived up to all of the hype I had heard over the years, sure, but it also went above and beyond.  The decor is charming, the staff fantastic, and the menu limited in a fantastic way. These are all good things. But man, the food...the food was out of this world.  I dig Thai food, and I especially like inspired takes on classic dishes. Noodlehead does that. I ordered some spring rolls as the appetizer and was blown away. I then got the Chiang Mai Curry--amazing. My mouth was so, so happy (after burning a little, that is).  As someone who is fairly allergic to shellfish, I'm pretty thankful about how aware the staff is. I've been to a number of restaurants--well-reviewed ones, too--that are shockingly ignorant about food allergies. Props to Noodlehead for actually being well-informed.  Noodlehead is cash only, though they have an ATM (with a surprisingly small surcharge) in the rear of the restaurant.",

My go to is the Pad See Ew - big flat rice noodles, egg, broccoli, napa cabbage, sweet black soy sauce. The sauce has a nice sweetness to it, which gives a good balance - especially if you order SPICY like me. Steamed buns are also a great app to start your meal. You really cannot go wrong with Noodlehead.",

All of their noodle dishes that I've tried have been a hit with me. My favorite is the Kee Mao, which is drunken noodles. Most of their dishes you can choose how spicy you want it to be on a scale of 1-5. I love going a little spicy then heading over to Millie's (which is next door) and getting some ice cream to cool off my tongue!  Remember to bring cash!",

Now, I have had pad Thai a bunch of places and have even had it made by a friend from Thailand. When I got this Pad Thai, I had a hard time eating it because they overpower the noodles with peanuts. I know it said there was peanuts in the description but I felt like I was eating peanut butter noodles at some point and I couldn't even finish them.   However, my BF got a curry and his curry was delicious. The pork buns were good too. And the service here was great.",

When we were finally ready to order we shared a plate of the See Yew Chicken (stir-fry flat noodles) & the Street Noodle #1 (rice noodle with Thai fried chicken, bok choy, bean sprout & cilantro). When the See Yew came out it looked plain but was fairly tasty still. I felt it needed a little more soy sauce but that's just me. The Street Noodle #1 tasted to me like a Thai sweet n sour. It was pretty tasty & the Thai fried chicken worked perfect with it.  The decor inside was nice & the waitress was very polite & friendly. I would recommend this place when visiting Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "The honey took me here per their colleague's recommendation....and I continue to be disappointed in Pittsburgh's food offerings.   Don't get me wrong. It's not terrible. Just not good either.  I'll start with the ambiance. It was very cute, albeit a bit dark. I liked the happy plants that greeted you at the door, and the bouquet up in the front was formidable. Huge. Big plant energy everywhere.  We were seated quickly, and our server was very nice. Not a lot of small talk (my kind of server), but checked on us an appropriate amount. Enough to at least make sure we didn't cause any trouble, haha.  I ordered the Chiang Mai curry, and bae, the street noodles #1. The menu made it abundantly clear that the restaurant considered spice as no joke. I believed them, so I ordered the spice level in number 4. \"Thai spicy\" in their words. This was my first mistake.  There was maybe enough spice to make a member of the Weenie Hut Jr feel cool they could tolerate it, but to make actual heat seekers ask themselves, \"what?\" It just wasn't spicy. And normally I could overlook that, but the sauce/curry had little flavor of its own. It tasted like what I'd imagine coconut milk would taste like if it got waitlisted to become Penang curry. Just weak.   My partner, however, didn't mind their entree. They particularly liked the chicken on their street noodles. I sampled his dish, and it was better than mine, but again, not great.   In terms of price, I felt that it was fair. Our noodle dishes were $9.50 each. It's cash only, which was strange but not an issue for us, haha.   But yes, I'm giving it three stars, because it reminded me of my college years eating Tin Drum. Only minus the unlimited Thai tea. And because service and ambiance were lovely. I see myself begrudgingly eating here once the move is finalized.   Please Pittsburgh, make better Asian food.",

The chicken breading was light and crispy, though I did have a few slices that were over cooked but the flavor and the rest of the dish was enough to save it. The broth had well developed flavors with just the right amount of heat and acidity. I thought I was having their best dish up until I tasted the shrimp pad Thai. The pad Thai was potentially the best I've ever had with a balance of sweet and salty balanced with the perfect amount of tamarind and acidity that elevates the naturally savory flavors.",

You can't go wrong with any of the appetizers. Spring rolls come in two and are crunchy and delicious with a dipping sauce. The sweet potato triangles come in six and are also delicious, sweet, crunchy, and served with their own sauce. Dumplings are served in fours with a soy sauce type dipping sauce and the steamed pork buns are served in a pair. The pour is succulent and juicy and the bun is like a delicious little pillow.   The Sukothai is full of flavor and has everything you could want and is a great portion for $6.50. I love the street noodle one - the chicken is perfectly battered and crispy and served in a delicious sauce with noodles and veggies. Street noodles 2 is basically the shrimp version.   Kee Mao is a great traditional noodle dish and served with the wide noodles. I prefer the chicken but the shrimp is always delicious (I've never had the tofu). The Pad Thai is consistently perfect and always a great option when you don't know what to get.   My advice would be rounding down when picking a spice level. From my experience, it seems like sometimes the spice level varies so better to be safe than sorry.",

First - yes, you have to wait. They do not have a phone, you can't make reservations or use no wait. Do the old school-thing where you actually go and talk to someone and wait for your table to be ready. On the positive side, if you're a Noodlehead take out regular you can now order online!  Second - cash only. Even if you order online you must pay in store with cash upon pick up. If you forget, they have an ATM on site.   Third - the menu isn't huge, but you'll find staples dishes here. I had the See Yew with chicken. Highly recommend if you love the wide noodles. Wide the spice rating! I love the heat, but even a 2 was enough for me. Like the menu says - you can always add more, but you can't take it out.   Fourth - It's also BYOB so don't forget to bring a bottle of wine!",

I'm glad we got takeout because when we got there the line outside was crazy.  Here's the reason for not 5: I've had Thai from less known places that is just as good if not just slightly better (in my opinion of course). Also, we tried to go there once and eat in, and the hostess very, VERY shortly told us she would not seat a table of 4 for the rest of the evening due to the crowd. I totally get it, but she was extremely curt and sarcastic. Didn't love that. However, you can't deny the food is good. If you want to experience the hype, I. D.o.n.t think you'll be disappointed.",

I'm not much of a spicy fan so I ordered it with level 1 spice. The dish was very tasty and full of different flavors and textures. The broth was very creamy with some sweetness that blended great with the spice. The chicken added some additional flavor to the dish and was cooked properly. My favorite part of the Chiang Main curry was definitely the crispy noodles that topped the dish; I enjoyed crunching them down into the broth and eating them that way, with the right amount of crunch.   I'm giving this place a 4/5 stars because I wasn't really wowed by my dining experience. I would like to try this place again and get more food.",

    "text": "You have to try this place!  I heard rumors that this place was a must go to place in pittsburgh and wow were the rumors True! I was told that their Pad Thai was something they were well known for. However I decided to try the other options on their menu such as the Love Boat and Kee Moa to see if they had more to offer than just their Pad Thai. I gotta say I'm surprised no one is talking about either of those dishes because they're simply amazing! I wasn't disappointed at all in my order and thankful I branched out in trying dishes I'm not as familiar with!   Something I appreciated was the fast order time and quick service, the place was PACKED but I was in and out with no problems. Other things I enjoyed about noodlehead was their simplified menu choices! None of that shuffling through 3 pages of options, rather one double sided page that gives the entire selection.   Overall I would love to come back here again and try their Pad Thai next time, I'm sure not to be disappointed.",

I love thicker noodles in general and I appreciate the addition of the eggs in the dish. I would say that there was one or two times where I felt the sauce was a tiny bit salty but overall, I can't get enough of this dish. For people who are new to this place, I usually recommend the pad thai. You can never go wrong with that!             You get to pick the spice level from a 0-5. I will say that the spiciness always differ even when you pick the same number each time but it isn't something that deters me from giving this place less stars.              I haven't tried the appetizers but that will definitely be my goal next time!  * Cost vs. Worth: Most of their noodle dishes are $9.5 (this place only accepts cash by the way!). If they charged more like $12, I'd still come back to this place.   Will I come here again? - I think you already know the answer to this.",

This was a wonderful couple of bites to momentarily subdue our growling bellies.  My local friend's favorite noodle dish is the Street Noodle #1, a combination of rice noodles, Thai fried chicken, bok choy, bean sprouts, and cilantro. There is a large scale of spiciness here at Noodlehead, but let us assure you that even the #2 (medium) on the spicy scale is very comfortably spicy! I love spice, but can't see myself getting anything spicier than that while still enjoying my meal. I tried a couple bites of her noodles, and really enjoyed the flavor! This is a solid choice.  I decided to get the Chiang Mai Curry, which features egg noodles, chicken, pickled mustard greens, bean sprouts, and crispy shallots in a yellow curry coconut milk sauce. It's so saucy that it honestly makes me think it's borderline soup. I would have loved an Asian soup spoon to get more of the broth with each bite, but settled for a regular spoon and my chopsticks to pluck at the noodles.  I really enjoyed this spot and would highly recommend it to my fellow noodleheads. Great noodle selection, and then some!",

    "text": "In a nutshell: Hip, modern and affordable. Small menu of some appetizers and Thai noodles. Cash only.   I really enjoyed Noodlehead. You can tell the quality of food when the place is packed and there are packs of people standing at the door waiting for a table. My husband and I came here on a Friday night and it looked incredibly busy, but the wait was only 15 minutes. We ordered the Sweet Potato Triangles for our appetizer, he ordered the Kee Mao and I ordered the Street Noodle #1. The sweet potato triangles were mashed sweet potato, wrapped in spring roll wrapper and deep fried, served alongside a light cucumber sauce. These were AMAZING. They were sweet, crunchy and when paired with the sauce, OMG. The refreshing cucumber cuts through the heaviness of the deep fried shell. The Kee Mao was delicious, but really spicy. My husband ordered spice level 1 and it was too spicy for the both of us. I also want to note that we are not sensitive to spice, as I typically order a 6 at other Thai places when I'm in the mood for mild spice. I ordered a 2 spice level for my street noodle #1 and it was perfect. The sauce was a sweet and spicy sauce. It's similar to Pad Thai, yet completely different. The noodles were very saucy, but it was perfect to dip the chicken in.   I would give Noodlehead 4.5 stars. I loved everything about this place except for the over spice on my husband's Kee Mao, despite its low spice level. Maybe it was a mix up in the kitchen so I'm definitely willing to go back to give it another try.",

My mom is a Thai lover as well- so on a beautiful Fall Friday when I had the afternoon off work, we visited Noodlehead. There is some outside seating, but it was a little chilly so we sat indoors.   Here are a couple things you need to know before visiting: 1. CASH ONLY 2. BYOB! (Only a 50 cents \"recycling\" fee per person) 3. Parking isn't the best- we paid to park at a meter outside of Noodlehead. There is residential parking but it's permit.   Our server was nice & attentive to our table despite being very busy with a late lunch rush. She brought us glasses for our wine & a pitcher of water for the table shortly after our arrival. We ordered the pork belly steamed buns to start. I heard awesome things & had to try them. For our entrees, we ordered the chicken pad thai (spiciness at a 3), street noodles #1 (spiciness at a 3) with chicken & the beef soup (spiciness at a 1).  Pork belly steamed buns- I have always wanted to try these little adorable Thai sandwiches but wasn't sure where to find them before Noodlehead. They were good & very simple. Basically just BBQ pork in a steamed bun with some pickled cucumber on top. I added sriracha to mine to add some spicy flavor- they literally weren't spicy at all without it. At two per order for $6, there aren't a bad deal- just not as flavorful as I had hoped.  Street Noodles #1- The chicken was AWESOME in this. For $9, the portion of noodles I received was large & the amount of chicken I received was awesome as well. The chicken was fried but the batter was more fluffy than fried tasting. Really tasty. The noodles were disappointing. I understand that Fish Sauce is in A LOT of Thai. I'm not a fish person AT ALL, but I deal with it. In 99% of the Thai restaurants that I have been to, I can't taste the fish sauce in their food. Usually I can't even smell it. This dish was the exception. It had completely too much fish sauce in it. I tried to neutralize it by adding Sriracha- didn't work. I didn't eat much of this dish in the restaurant because I hoped I could \"doctor it up\" at home by adding sesame oil, soy sauce & chili oil, to make it less fishy. I couldn't even eat them then. I'm not sure if it was just a bad day or if these noodles are always this fishy but I wasn't impressed at all with this dish.  Beef Soup- My mom really liked this. I am not really a beef soup person, but the bite I tried was tasty. It had a slight spicy kick to it, which was nice. The portion was huge- what she didn't eat at the restaurant, she had for dinner the next day.  Chicken pad thai- Still fishy. Not as fishy as Street Noodles by ANY means, but it was still fishy. We added fresh lime juice & Sriracha & that seemed to do the trick of neutralizing the fish sauce. After adding those ingredients we really enjoyed it.  I don't want to give Noodlehead two stars- I love the decor of this place, it's rustic & modern, yet still Thai feeling, the presentation of the noodles were great & I am a fan of the prices & the fact that they are BYOB. But I can't give them a good rating considering two dishes we ordered were overpowered with fish sauce. If I have to take a dish home in order to make it better, then the restaurant didn't deliver like they should have. The pork belly steamed buns were also disappointing. I ended up ordering some to-go for the boyfriend & he thought they were bland as well.  I would be willing to return.. everyone seems to love this place, so maybe I just came on a bad day.",

    "text": "As someone who loves exploring new noodle options, Noodlehead was shockingly disappointing. There are plenty of better options in Pittsburgh to choose from, so don't settle unless it's extremely convenient.   Ambiance: South Highland and the surrounding East End / Shadyside area is always a great place to be, especially without side seating in the summer. The inside is a quirky rustic, which they pull off very well. In general, my biggest qualm (other than the okay food) is that they are cash only. While I do understand, it's incredibly inconvenient. In addition, they don't have a phone so you can't call ahead for Togo orders. I would agree that noodles are best fresh and you should likely enjoy them as soon as possible, it's inconvenient when you live near by and end up waiting 20 minutes in the cold for your order.   Food: After hearing all the rave, I took my mom to Noodlehead when she came to visit. We enjoyed the outside seating and ordered the Street food #1 and the Pad see Yew at the waitress's recommendation. My mom ended up eating the chicken off the #1 which was good but not supposed to be the main event.   I'm sure I will inevitably be drug back and hope my opinion changes. Noodlehead has the perfect location and the right food style to be my most frequented near by restaurant (I will just need more cash).",

Apparently a lot of people were waiting for/ordering takeout which created the bottleneck. Facilitating a way to better distinguish dine-in vs. takeout would help...  Eventually, we were seated. The ambiance was nice enough... certainly had a hipster-ish vibe though which straddles the line between cool and pretentious. We ordered spring rolls, street noodles 2 and kee mao. The service was satisfactory. The food was also good and relatively inexpensive but I can't say it was any better than other Thai dishes I had elsewhere. The portions however- specifically my street noodles - were also small. I'd happily pay a few extra dollars to leave not still hungry.  Sometimes I feel like certain places collapse under the weight of their inflated yelp reviews and to me this was the case here.",

We had the pork buns and even though I am usually not a big fan of pork buns, I couldn't get enough of the ones here. The texture and the flavor combinations is absolutely divine. As a main I had the Chiang Mai Curry and boy was it good. Again, perfect texture, enough chicken, taste was incredible and I couldn't stop eating. You choose between a spice level of 1 -5 . I had 1 and that was more than enough for me (I cannot handle spice well though). If you can't finish the portion, ask for a takeaway box.  Staff was patient with us, quick and super friendly. Nice outdoor seating is available as well. They definitely have found a new regular customer!",

The pad thai (my preference = with those perfect tiny shrimp!) is now an old standby, but Street Noodle #1 is an equally viable option. I've also been lusting after the Chiang Mai curry as of late.

I mark my return with a trip and review to Noodle Head in Shadyside. I've been to NH a number of times and I feel it is about time I pile in the praise they deserve.   To start, as I usually do, let's discuss the decor. The interior can only be described as cool. Not pretentious cool but a pleasant mix of plastic seating, to reflect their roots in Thai street food, and dark wood. I felt very comfortable, as did the hipsters sitting next to me, and the businessmen next to them.   I also live NHs bar options. It's BYO so if the wine sucks, it'd your fault. To go with the BYO liquor license they do have a corkage fee, but it's only fifty cents a person  which I think is very reasonable.   The food at NH is amazing. I am a fan if the sliced beef appetizer as well as the steamed pork belly buns. For an entree my standby us the Ching Mai curry. The flavor of the curry is out if this world. Pickled veg with coconut milk and a crazy amount of spice. Fantastic. Don't fear spice here. They utilize a 1-5 heat scale (I'm a 4) but even in the hottest dishes the spice doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the rest of the food.    The only thing they lose a star for is service. The staff always seems to be inconvenienced by the guests. They aren't mean or rude but they give off the impression that they would rather be doing something else.   All in all I love NH. So many times Thai food just gets caught in an inferno if chili heat that the food loses all it's flavor and you pay out the rectum (literally) the next day.  Not so here and despite being cash only I plan in going back. Often.",

    "text": "This is a great new sport my husband and I went to randomly when everything else around had long waits.  The atmosphere was nice. Great design and theme but it was very cold and drafty every time the door opened.   We had the pig wings which were just okay. The sauce was good but overwhelming and it was really small considering they were two bucks a pop. Came with a homemade pickle salad that tasted like taking a shot of vinegar... I love anything picked and this was unbearable.  The Chiang mai curry was outstanding. Nice mix of coconut milk and spice. The noodles were crunchy on top and a nice way to soak up the coconut milk curry soup in the bowl. I got a spice level 2 and it was perfect, it was the right kick of heat without having me reach for a drink every bite.   My husband had the noodle #1 at a level 4 heat so I didn't even try... way too spicy for me. I did have the chicken on top which was not spiced and everyone's review is right-it's well with it for the amazing chicken. Chicken was nice and juicy and had a great crunchy coating.  This is a great spot to try something new. Not too expensive, byob with $5 fee per person. But it's cash only so be advised. They do have an ATM. I just think with all the apps out there they can get it together and accept cards... just a peeve of mine.",

We got the pork buns which came out way too fast - probably 2 mins after we placed our order and could have been warmer and/or fresher but it was all uphill from there. The sukothai and chang mai noodles were the right amount of spicy for us (3) and had so many amazing flavors! We loved this place.  Downside is they don't take credit cards but nothing should deter you from going here and trying it at least once and probably more!",

    "text": "\"FEATURING TASTY NOODLE DISHES FROM THE STREET MARKETS OF THAILAND!\"  is what Noodlehead's website blazes.  Had a Friday evening dinner recently with a group of 6 to celebrate one of who had been visiting and working with us  for six months from Thailand.  She is returning to Thailand next week.  We were surprised when she wanted Thai food for her farewell dinner back to Thailand, but later she told us this food tastes nothing like the street food in Thailand (so much for the website claim).  However, if it's good enough for someone from Thailand to choose it for a farewell dinner, it's probably pretty good.  Parking is absolutely terrible around this area of Highland Ave.  At least it's relatively safe as you're walking to your car 4 blocks away.  Arriving at 5:40pm, the  small space (seats about 50 by my estimation) was already completely full.  Pittsburghers do like to eat early.  Noodlehead has an annoying but well documented policy that they won't seat you until your entire group is present.  Although some of our group members were late, there wasn't anywhere for us to sit until 30 minutes anyway.  Noodlehead is BYOB (50 cents/person corkage), so no drinks while you're waiting (and this is not the kind of place that will call you while you grab a drink down the street).  The menu is basic American-Thai fare.  There's just a few appetizers like pork belly steamed buns and Thai fried chicken.  There's a variety of noodle dishes like Pad Thai and \"Street Noodle.\"  As other's have mentioned, for most of the dishes you pick a spice level from 1 to 5.  1 is clear your sinuses, slightly runny nose hot so be very careful unless you're used to this kind of thing (our Thai friend ordered a 5).  You'll have a better meal and avoid next-day unpleasantness.    Everything was tasty, but no better or worse than any other Thai place that I've been to in Pittsburgh.    The service was fast and friendly.  By the time we got up to leave, the crowd waiting was staggering.  More people were waiting than there were seats in the restaurant.  Noodlehead's good, but with the hideous parking situation, the long wait for a table, and the overall standard cuisine, I don't understand the popularity of this particular establishment.",

    "text": "I have probably been here about 5 times over the past few years, the most recent time being this past weekend. I was really impressed on my first visit by the interior of the restaurant. It's very unique and still looks as though it just recently opened.  The menu is fairly straightforward. I appreciate places that keep things simple, as opposed having menus that are the length of a short book. Variety is good, but you have to draw the line somewhere!  The pork belly steamed buns are an absolute must. Tender shredded pork topped with a small amount of pickled cucumber that adds a nice texture and flavor. The buns themselves are fluffy and delicious. You get two in a serving... don't split this with anyone because you will DEFINITELY want more than one. I don't want to even think about how many of these I could probably eat if given the challenge.  I've had a few noodle dishes and enjoyed them all, but on my most recent trip I had the pad thai with chicken. They take spice pretty seriously here, so I ordered a two out of five. I could have probably gone to a three but it was still fairly spicy. The portion was also pretty generous and I ended up taking leftovers for lunch the next day.  The only downside, as many have mentioned, is that they don't take credit cards. Kind of annoying as I am one of those people who rarely carries much cash, but it's worth it for this place.",

The restaurant is a little too precious for its own good in some ways-- they don't take credit cards and they don't have a phone??--but the food is so yum that I forgive them.  It's BYOB and almost all the noodle dishes are $9, so it's a super inexpensive date night, if you can get a table.  I still really wish they'd offer me a telephone number so I could call ahead for takeout.   So on to the food.  The pork steamed buns are a must-try appetizer.  I often threaten to go there and just get multiple orders of these for dinner, but it hasn't happened just yet.  My favorite noodles are the pad see yew--sweet, tangy, and good balance of ingredients.  The green curry linguini is great, though I wish it had some veggies. Note that everything is quite spicy, so a 3 out of 5 spice is more akin to a 7/8 out of 10 at a lot of other Thai places.     There is nothing disappointing on the menu.  One of the best values around, for sure.",

I searched for a \"while\" (specifically I've been to Nicky's Thai, Smiling Banana Leaf, Thai Cuisine on Liberty Ave, Silk Elephant), and none of those compare.  I've had 4 dishes here: Pad Thai, Chiang Mai Curry, See Yew and Pork buns.  Btw, Silk Elephant is also \"OK\" Thai, but if you are torn between the two, go to Noodlehead. As a side-point I also HIGHLY recommend Pusadee's Garden in Lawrenceville. It's BYOB and Thai spicy/flavorful also, but isn't cash only and, oh yea they actually have a phone number :-) The downside is they are a bit more expensive....

    "text": "Let me tell you how hard it was for me to visit this place.  It's not to complain, just to show how forgetful I am.  I love the stretch of Highland that Noodlehead sits on.  There is so much life on this small strip that the sidewalks become congested rather easily and parking is horrendous, but that doesn't stop people from lining up to get in here.  Another reason I had been avoiding coming here was my new found allergy to peanuts.  Not knowing how this allergy could be set off I decided to steer clear of here until I had properly addressed this.  Once I had my ducks in a row all I needed to do was remember to bring CASH.  I rarely carry cash on myself, becoming a follower of the technology movement.  This time I had made plans ahead of time to visit here and stopped to get myself some cash.  Cash in hand I headed to Noodlehead.  The inside is very welcoming.  It feels very open and almost natural inside.  You are greeted promptly, when I was here we were told to take a seat wherever we please, we had picked a time before the line starts to form outside, so lucky for us the place wasn't crowded.  My companion I was with had raved about how good the food was so I leaned on him for suggestions.  He had been here multiple times and knew his way around the menu.  We had started our meal with Pork Belly Steam Buns.  For something so little it was packed with a lot of flavor.  So savory that I wished I had just ordered a multitude of those as my main meal.  It was one of those food that you just wanted to suck all the flavor out of until your tongue wrapped around that pork belly and you made sure every single taste bud got a sample of that flavor.  My mouth is watering thinking about it right now.  I was happy to see that water was brought fresh to every table upon being seated.  But I was also happy to see that they had sodas on the menu that I could actually drink.  Whenever a restaurant has Sprite from Mexico on the menu they always get bonus points in my book.  For my main course I had decided I would give the Beef Soup a try.  I was a little puzzled when I was asked what level of spice I wanted.  Not knowing for sure I deferred to my companion and thought that the suggestion to get it at a low level but have more brought out with my meal in case I wanted to up the heat was a brilliant idea.  The mixture of the fresh vegetables and perfectly cooked beef was the best.  The thin rice noodles were to die for.  But I loved the bean sprouts and bok choy the most.  They added a crunch to this dish that made it feel a little more like a meal rather than a soup.  Unfortunately for me, I could not devour this big bowl of soup.  I was so full after about half that I had to stop eating.  The staff in here were great.  They were so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu/establishment.  Might I also say that they were fast as hell?  My god, maybe it was the time we were there, but they were lightning fast.  Everything we ordered showed up in no time flat.    This place is definitely a reason for me to carry cash around.  **ATM on site (found this out afterwards), BYOB**",

Also its downtown so its street parking, no private lot. I got the pad thai, street noodle #1 and pork belly steamed buns. There pork buns were delicious, it tasted tangy and sweet with a very authentic taste. 2 was not nearly enough! The Pad Thai portion however was huge, way too much noodle, I was full after a quarter of the way through with a lot of leftovers which I boxed for later. The chicken in the street noodle #1 dish was so crispy and juicy. I loved it. Definitely a specialty dish that you cannot find at other Thai restaurants which is what makes this place so unique and great. I highly recommend this if you're in the area.",

I have been here at least 10 times, if not more. The service and food are consistently amazing. Their broth is extremely flavorful, they keep the tables and environment spotless and well decorated, and they have never failed to have fresh plants on display, which I appreciate in the winter.  Winning Dishes Are: The Loveboat and Pork Buns.  This is the perfect spot to take someone new to Pittsburgh if you want to impress them with our cuisine!",

Essentially it's a twist of regular Thai food where they put noodles in some curries instead of serving it with rice. I have only tried one of the two curries offered and it was very flavorful and really good. They have a lot of other dishes that I am looking forward to try. The dishes are pretty cheap and the restaurant is very quick with service! Our dishes came out in 3 mins. Will be coming back to try other dishes. They also have random mexican drinks on the menu for some reason. Great restaurant!",

    "text": "Noodlehead shook me up man.  So I came here every week in college basically with my good friend after our intro piano class which was hard as rocks, and noodlehead's atmosphere is just the perfect place to let off that school/work/life angst and just have a good time with good people. It really is. BYO-drinks is the best part of that and it's always buzzing with good energy.   WELL when I went back a year and a half later I got two things: the Chang mai curry and the pad see yew.   The pad see yew was always my usual and I love it here because it is such a classic Thai dish but sometimes I feel like I have to add to it with sriracha. And I love sriracha so sometimes I go over board and over power my food with it, but I like that, you know? Not this one tho. The flavors of the dish are so good that I don't even wanna touch it. Spicy level 2 is perfect for me to keep the heat at a good kick but at the same time, not burn your buds off so you can't taste the flavor .. or the worst - when u have to wait for the dish to cool down in temperature because that adds to the heat and depletes the flavor.   Now THE CHANG MAI CURRY THO -  First time trying. As I was eating this I was thinking in my head, \"when can I fit in my schedule to come back here and have this again\". That's when you know it's incredible. It's the best Asian curry I have ever had. I think the restaurant could stand alone on this dish - it's not just the fact that it has great texture play with the egg noodles and the crunchy noodle garnish top, but the curry itself was out of this world. So much so that I kept JUST taking spoonfuls of it and letting the flavors sink into my taste buds. Same spice comments as mentioned above.   Last note - momofuku's David Chang says that the best places to eat sometimes are the ones that don't have exceptional service. Now, I've never had a problem with noodle heads service, ever. But this time around we waited around 20 minutes before someone came to our table. But the food was SO good that it didn't even matter at the end. Like I could not have left that place in any other mood but on cloud 9  PLEASE GO TO NOODLE HEAD  Also it's cash only with atm in the back.",

We ordered way too much food for just two people, but the menu has so many great dishes it's hard not to want to try them all. We ended up getting: the love boat, the pork baos, pad Thai, pad see ew, and the curry noodles. (There were a lot of leftovers). Everything was so delicious it's hard to go wrong with any choice. I would say my personal favorite was the pad see ew, and my boyfriend's favorite was the love boat. The only thing I would have to say is misleading is the spice level-- the dishes weren't as spicy as I was expecting them to be!   The service was fantastic the whole night and it was just a great atmosphere to dine on a Friday night. Will be back again!",

The Love Boat tasted nothing like a traditional Thai Boat Noodle, but it was edible.   I tried my friend's Chiang Mai Curry which I think is their version of Khao Soi and it was super sweet even when my friend asked for the Level 4 hotness.   Overall, not too impressed. Prices might be good for the area and their portion but don't think I'd really recommend this place to anyone who's looking for good Thai food.",

    "text": "Noodlehead reminds a little of the Midwest,hipster, small restaurant feel mixed with an east coast busyness and clamor. Loved the atmosphere and decor, it appears to be a nice casual date place. Noodlehead must be a local rage because there was a line from the time we got here, waited (30 minutes) and when we left. They have a small menu but everything looked so good. BYOB policy with a very minor 50 cents recycling fee per person. Service was excellent. They have an arrangement of regular low tables inside, and high tables that face the street. Menu prices are extremely reasonable for the portions, none above $9.50. We got the pig wing appetizer, and because I am indecisive, I got (aka forced) my husband to share two different noodle dishes.   The Chang mai curry noodles was a bowl of abundant noodles with chicken in a rich yellow curry sauce, thick with coconut cream. The generous portion of chicken was cooked to perfection - tender but moist. The dish included some fried noodles on top, which gave it a great extra texture. It could use vegetables or lime to lighten and brighten it up, but that being said I ate every last morsel that was in this bowl. Clearly I was not so offended by the lack of veggies.  The second dish was a noodle soup - the loveboat. This bowl of vermicelli noodles came with chopped bok and some tender beef slices. The soup came with basil and seemed to have a hint of lemongrass. It's unique in that it is both savory and slightly sweet. The basil definitely added to the meaty-ness of the beef. Noodles were abundant and cooked just right. We love spicy food but we ordered both dishes medium in heat, because the worst thing a restaurant could do is overspice the food that you can't taste anything but heat! I would say the loveboat is definitely slightly spicier than the Chang mai noodle dish, as the coconut cream tempered the spiciness.  The only minor gripe I had was the appetizer, which was the pig wings. This plate came with what appeared three spareribs, decent in portion, and slightly fried before tossed in the sauce. Texture was tender on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. The sauce was somewhat reminiscent of teriyaki but was slightly too salty. Mind you I was salivating while writing this review of my yesterday night dinner, so everything was decently good. If I had to redo the experience, the only thing I would change would be to possibly try another appetizer.  Verdict: If i could give a 4.75 stars with the little ding for the appetizer, i would. That being said we loved this establishment and the food despite the wait. We didn't have enough time to try the ice cream parlors next door but many people seemed to have checked them out while waiting.  Oh yeah if you haven't read the hundreds of reviews notifying you it is cash only, then that ones on you!",

The crispy chicken in the street noodle #1 was quite good, although the sauce was a little sweet and not as balanced as I would've hoped.   The lemongrass honey iced tea was refreshing and great with the meal as well. They also give you one refill!   I thought that Noodlehead was more of a take-out, hole-in-the-wall but I was pleasantly surprised that the ambiance was so chic + modern.   All of the noodles are $9.50 which is such a great price!!

    "text": "Husband and I visited around 2pm (Friday) and it was super busy!  I will admit, our initial impression of this place was NOT positive. The restaurant was really dark and relatively small, and the person at the counter was a bit indifferent.  We sat at the tabletop seats (where it was the brightest) and it took a while for our waitress to notice we were ready to order.  We ordered a Sukothai noodle (spicy level 4: Thai hot), Street noodle #1 (spicy level: medium), and spring rolls.  You can choose your spicy level (not hot ~ crazy hot).   The food was SOOOOOO DELICIOUS. The portion size was perfect, everything was flavorful, and the ingredients were fresh. The food here definitely tastes more authentic Asian; no shying away from strong herbs and spices. It reminded me of my trips to Southeast Asia.  Although the service wasn't the best, the food ABSOLUTELY made up for it!!!! Strongly recommend!!!",

We went to Millie's Ice Cream and then decided to stop by Noodlehead to pick some stuff up before taking an Uber back to our hotel. Boy was this place busy on a Friday evening! There were so many people waiting outside! It wasn't as bad after the Millie's run but we opted to place an order anyway. It's cash only and good luck trying to place an order with such a small hostess area. People were coming and going constantly! We placed our order and was quoted a 20 min wait for our food! It came out in due time! We ate when we got home and the food was pretty good! The Green Curry Fettuccine had awesome flavors and lots of veggies! It's sweet due to the coconut milk in the curry, and was very creamy! We enjoyed it a lot 4/5.  We also ordered the See Eww Noodles, which were also delicious in flavors! I thought it needed a bit of smokiness to the noodles so they weren't so wet. I almost felt like it was a bit too soft without the crisp to the noodles and the tofu. But I liked it nonetheless. Portions are a normal decent size. I would love to come back and dine in next time to try some of the other dishes! Interior looked cute and modern! Good place for date night! ___________  Actually came back for dinner the next night cause it's been some of the best food we've had during our short stay in Pittsburgh. We decided to come for a dine-in experience and expected a wait cause of how busy it was the previous night. The lady said about 20-25 mins, not horrible for a Saturday night. What I was disappointed with was that other parties that obviously came after us were seated before us. And I don't mean parties of 2, cause I knew those tables opened up quicker than larger tables for 4.. but I literally checked in with the hostess and other parties of 4 or 5 got crossed off the list before me and their names were after mine. Wtf?! There was no rhyme or reason to their madness.. then after we sat down and ordered, the table of 5 and another table of 4, that was seated after us got their food before us! Again.. wtf?! How were the tickets entered?! I felt like we were being discriminated against - I mean, what are the odds that most of the Caucasian groups were seated and got their food before us?! Especially if they were seated after us?! Or arrived after us?! This place doesn't take reservations and is a first come, first serve restaurant so I can't think of any other possible explanations. Besides that, the food was again spot on at a very reasonable price. The See Eww Noodles has delicious flavors and we had nothing to complain about. The pork dumplings weren't anything special but the noodles.. get them, you won't be disappointed.  I lowered the star rating because of the horrible wait and service - we literally ended up waiting about 1.5 hrs total to be seated and for our food.",

Now that that's out of the way (and it wasn't a problem for us), the review: my friend insisted we go here upon my visit to him him in Pittsburgh, as he'd said this is the best Thai in the city. While my sample size currently sits at an \"n\" of 1, I don't see a reason to disagree. I had an excellent pad kee mao dish with extra chicken. The sauce in particular had incredible flavor.   It was also quite affordable - I think after the addition of extra chicken, it was still in the $11-$13 range. I wish I could go back for more; I'll just have to visit Pittsburgh again soon!",

Noodlehead is BYOB with a $0.50 recycling fee per person, so we brought along a bottle of wine. The hostess opened the bottle for us and provided us with glasses so we could drink while we waited! We ended up being seated after about 20 minutes.   We shared the Street Noodle 1 and Chiang Mai Curry (both were $9.50) and they were both amazing! The fried chicken in the Street Noodle 1 wasn't too bready and felt freshly fried. The saltiness of it with the slight sweetness of the sauce and noodles were divine. The curry in the Chiang Mai Curry was simply freaking delicious. Pour some of it over the crunchy noodles and you have yourself a piece of paradise. My mouth is watering just thinking about them!   I was just the right amount of full when we finished eating. For the price, the size and flavor are well worth it! I will most definitely come back again next time I'm in Pittsburgh and wish this restaurant was in my city instead!",

I'm not a fan of thin noodles but I was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the ones in Love Boat! Super flavorful, umami broth. The Kee Mao was also really good, not full of filler and a good ratio of protein (shrimp), noodles and vegetables.

Solid but not spectacular food: Big noodle bowls of various types with pretty good flavor for low prices.  Summary: I went with my girlfriend for lunch on a Friday. We were seated right away but not served for 10 minutes or so (the place was a bit understaffed for such a crowded lunch hour). Once we were served things moved along quickly. The restaurant is oddly dark for a fairly loud, trendy spot geared toward a young crowd. They have a mix of high tables, low tables, booths, and even a few outdoor tables.  We both enjoyed our noodle bowls (which are good deals at $9.50). I got pad see ew which was a large plate of wide noodles with a little broccoli and some cabbage. I got it with shrimp although there was not much shrimp. Good flavor. My girlfriend got the green curry. Excellent flavor and lots of veggies, but the veggies were steamed and not flavored/mixed with the curry sauce. She got it with tofu, and like mine there wasn't too much tofu (although it was good).  We got an appetizer of veggie spring rolls, which were small and not much to write home about. I'd skip these next time.",

Be cautious with the seasoning because it was very spicy. It had a ma-la feel to it in that there was a bit of burning along with a very mild numbing sensation.",

    "text": "Number 1 street noodle hype! I've been here lots of times and felt like it was finally time to leave a review I love this place and flavours are amazing. Obviously, I have a favourite dish. You should try it. It's quite good. Cash only, everything is affordable. It gets quite busy in peak hours. No reservations, you get there and wait until you're served.  Spice level is 1-5. 1 is actually a perfect spice level for most people. 2 is for those that like to live a little. Keep the water handy. 3 an above is for people who like their tongues burned. If you're on a date, here is not the place to show your spice tolerance off.  It's a good 2nd to 4th date spot. Not as safe as you'd play it on the first date as it's more esoteric and the atmosphere is a bit more off the wall unique, but it's good for lowkey impressing someone with your taste. Also good to go to with friends. One thing that I think is understated in the yelp reviews is that noodlehead is actually pretty convenient for pickup and takeout. Just get to the location, go up to the cashier, tell her what you want, wait a little bit, get noodles. It's a little slower than going to chipotle but well...you're not getting food from chipotle. More than once, I've been in and out with sit down restaurant quality food with fast food joint wait times.  In short. Eat noodles. Mouthgasm. Get hype.",

It's a fairly limited menu, but that speaks to the great care 'n attention put into each dish. The kitchen's consistency is on point. Order freely because there's nary a bad thing to be had! My fave \"snack\" is the pork belly steamed buns and the Chiang Mai Curry is my go-to noodle. But be forewarned...while the \"1-10\" spice scale is for the others, Noodlehead's five level heat index is da real Holyfield. Lastly, service is pleasant, professional, and fast. And the stylish, minimalist decor while unexpected, simply works. No phone + no use of 'Nowait' means you just gotta be in the know. More importantly it's straight cash, homey. Now go and go often!",

I think this is a popular area and can be seen as a great place to meet up with friends to have dinner. It has an outdoors, Asian island vibe but indoors.  The menu is simple and affordable and the service is great. As far as the food, it has a very modern and American take on Thai cuisine. It's not authentic by any means, but does tend to cater to the American palate.   I tried the street noodles #2 and #1. Cooked well, seasoned well. However, it had a lot of fish sauce and sweet chili sauce. I'm sure that's how the dish is suppose to taste. It was okay. Food presentation is excellent!  For appetizers: pork buns and fresh spring rolls! The pork buns were delicious. Buns were perfectly small, soft, and fluffy. Pork was a tad grease but that's okay! I loved it. The fresh spring roll lacked a lot of flavor. I couldn't really taste the freshness of the herbs. The dipping sauce made up for it.  I'll come back, maybe to try another noodle dish?? There are better authentic Thai restaurants around the city, why would I? Noodlehead is a great place for entertaining friends or family, offers great ambiance/service, and even great for a date night. Don't forget to bring cash with you, it's cash only.",

Unfortunately, they do not take orders in advance because they don't have a phone - you have to place your order in person - so, we had to stand around waiting on the sidewalk for quite a while. I had the Green Curry Linguine and my husband had the Steamed Pork Dumplings and Street Noodle 1. The flavors were great. Beware of the spice levels! Usually when I order spicy food it's not as hot as I would have liked, so we ordered the hottest level (5) and it was a bit too much for me. I would give Noodlehead 4 stars in terms of food but a 3 overall, due to the lack of convenience. I would go back, but they seriously need to get a phone and start accepting credit cards.",

    "text": "Yum!  Unlike most noodle shops, which are usually more Japanese or Vietnamese in focus, or Chinese, this one is of a predominantly Thai bent.  I stopped in here tonight for a light bite mainly because my mouth is sore from a medical procedure and I'm only eating soup and soft food for now, plus I do love a good noodle shop and have wanted to try this place.    I got the Sukhotai noodle soup because it looked like I would have little chewing to do since the pork in it was ground.  It was absolutely delicious, and definitely manageable in the chewing department.    And surprise of surprises, the heat scale they have actually means something!  I normally like a 12-15 on a 1-10 scale in Asian restaurants because most even make 10s super bland for the average American palate, but with a sore mouth, I only ordered a 1 out of 5, figuring that would give me a slight sense of their seasoning while still keeping me safe.  But wow, it had *waaay* more kick than 99% of other places!  Which ordinarily I would have loved - and it *was* absolutely divine - but I unfortunately had to send it back for a 0. Which was still only a fraction less delicious.    The portion size was much smaller than at most noodle houses, but a much more reasonable serving for a single meal, and at only $6, it's a real steal.  Ideally, an appetizer would round this out into truly a good amount of food for dinner, but I just could not manage it today. The most expensive dishes top out at a whopping $15 - still a fantastic bargain.    I will totally be back to try out the rest of the menu when my mouth heals up.",

But the staff are always polite. Keep in mind that their heat scale is no joke, either!

However, I have to say that Noodlehead way exceeded my expectations and I am itching to go back.   I ordered the Pad See Ew and was pleasantly surprised by how fresh the noodles were-- most Thai restaurants serve you a sticky clump of noodles saturated in the same boring sauce. But the noodles in this dish were not clumped together, and the sauce was perfect in proportion to the noodles. I also had a taste of the other noodles-- the Chiang Mai Curry noodles are also an awesome choice. Actually, you probably wouldn't go wrong with any of the noodle dishes there.   With regards to the spicy scale, I ordered \"THAI HOT\" and my face was a little bit sweaty. But if you love spicy food, I'd definitely recommend you go for a 5. I didn't think \"THAI HOT\" was really that spicy at all.",

Thai hot option simply meant further dousing with hot chili's, and not favor enhancement. Overall we didn't care too much for all our dishes.",

The menu is not huge, but it doesn't need to be. Everything is delicious. The appetizer of pork steamed buns is SO good. I can't go there without those steamed buns ..   You can choose your spice level for each dish. I warn that its pretty spicy. They have a scale from 1-5 and although I'm not very big on spicy things, sometimes a level 1 is a little much. So I'd stick to a lower number to start and you can always add spice if it's not enough.   It's also BYOB, which is a huge perk because the fee is .50 a person .. So basically free. It's also right down the street from a big wine store where i always stop to grab a bottle before i head there.   The service is also always good and quick even if the place is packed we never wait that long to eat once we are sitting.",

I would recommend this place in a second.   My only complaint is they need a phone and some options to get more veg in meals because, as a veggie lover, I would totally love to have options that allow me to get more veg in my dish. I do love to get the summer rolls (they are vegetarian for anyone wondering). If Noodlehead can add a veggie option (sub for protein?) I'd say this spot is 5 star.  Any dish you choose is going to be great, but if you're looking for a suggestion the fried chicken (available avid a side or in a street noodle dish) has been a crowd pleaser with everyone I've dined with here.  Edit: Noodlehead took the time to message me to let me know they can substitute veggies for a protein if you ask. Fab news! 5 stars from me!",

It has been a few months since I visited and since then I was able to try Nicky's Thai downtown which seems to be another popular spot to grab Thai food.   I absolutely love the industrialized rustic atmosphere of this restaurant. I also love how they utilized space by adding bench style seating along the walls and by adding the larger tables with benches in the center space allow room for larger parties.   Keep in mind* this is a cash only restaurant, but they do have an ATM inside for your use if you forget cash. Also, it's BYOB and there is no cork fee!   My mom and I ordered the beef soup to start which was a really nice size bowl filled with beef and rice noodles. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai for my meal. This so was flavorful and not too spicy. It's nice that you are able to pick the level of spiciness you prefer. They give you a lot of food for a really great price! The service was also very good for how busy they were. I personally prefer Noodle head over Nicky's Thai and I will definitely be back!",

The one that has short hair, bangs and glasses was terribly rude to many people as Myself and many others (whom commented on her behavior amongst each other) witnessed tonight. Her behavior as someone who is customer faced is unacceptable. Many people agreed she made them feel like 'wow maybe we shouldn't be here'...pretty embarrassing someone can even give you an inkling of that while wanting to dine at a restaurant. I thought maybe she was having a bad day or something bad happened and what not, but regardless, in the work force, that behavior shouldn't fly without, at the least, being reprimanded. It would be in the best interest of the restaurant and loyal customers to get a new host or give a bit more training on how to speak with respect to people. The other host who also had glasses but was a bit taller with her hair up was very kind and sweet.",

The options are somewhat limited, but regardless of what you get, you will be satisfied.The spring rolls and pad Thai keep me coming back for more - the price to portion ratio is perfect. I often find myself bringing half of it back for lunch the next day! The only drawbacks are that it is cash only (with an ATM conveniently located in the back) and they do not take reservations. Whenever my friends come into town, Noodlehead is my go-to.",

Kind of organic/industrial/modern with an Asian twist? My only complaint is the number of stools without backs.

The broth was flavorful, and the meat was good, but I've had better Sukothai at other places, so this place was just average when it comes to Sukothai. The Street Noodles #1 however, I felt is a sham. This is the easiest dish to make, it's just rice noodles (from prepackaged) that they soaked and fried with soy sauce, anyone can do that! And the thai fried chicken wasn't anything special too, it's just fried with batter but no seasonings or flavor into the batter. This is the easiest dish to make, and I'm so surprised that so many people love it, it's not even that good. This isn't even Thai, Thai food likes to marry sweet, sour, salty, spicy, bitter, all together, whereas this dish just had salty from soy sauce. It's such a basic dish and so cheap to make too that while people think $9 is a good value, I think it's a ripoff considering just how easy and cheap it is to make.",

The food here when they how spicy always go low cause it actually is a burning spicy but not a mala spicy and you can always add to it.  The noodles are good to get but same as the appetizers such as the fried pork are always good to try and the portions are decent sized",

I like that because it's fuss free for the most part when paying. If you don't have cash they have an ATM towards the back on the right. Their bathrooms are back there too and I find they're too dim in the evenings. They're nice and clean though.  I've sat inside and outside (during warmer temps) and I like the outside when it's crowded because sometimes it can get too loud and then you're struggling to hear the person across from you. On the other hand the inside can be better so people walking by on the sidewalk don't gawk at you eating from the big portions they give you. Big, tasty portions.  The two appetizers (which can basically be meals on their own) I'm obsessed with are the pork buns and fried chicken. I'm drooling already. The pork buns have a mix of flavors and it's kind of sweet/savory and perfect. As for the fried chicken..well..it's a generous portion of crunchiness and that red sauce they give you is just the right amount of spicy for me. I'm kind of a wuss when it comes to spicy even though I love spicy stuff in general. Here, they already make it a little zingy and then ask you what number on the spicy scale you want it on top of that.  I always get see yew with shrimp and I'm never ever disappointed. It contains big flat noodles, broccoli, black soy sauce that's sweet and egg. It's only $9! Sometimes the service can be lagging but the people are friendly, the place is nice, and the food has me coming back. Also, they always have beautiful fresh flowers up front that I notice. I love that touch!",

This was my first visit to Noodlehead, was immediately greeted by hostess when I walked in. Was asked to step aside while I waited for my co worker to join me for lunch. I selected a few of the snack items and the iced honey tea. The sweet potato triangles were perfectly deep friend with a flaky texture. The vegetable rolls were just as tasty and fresh, can't wait to return when I have more time to try a noodle dish.",

I do not have a long history of loving/knowing good thai food but I do love this soup.  I order it at a 0 spice and ask them to bring the spice on the side.    The wait staff is kind of BLAH and they are weird about taking your $20 bill for a $9 meal and asking if you want change - instead of just bringing your change.  Yes, I want my $11 change and you barely earned basic gratuity. every.single.time  But I will continue to go for the LoveBoatSoup both dine in and take out.  SO good.    OPENS at NOON.

    "text": "I live within walking distance of three Thai places in Berkeley, CA and none of them are even in the same league as Noodlehead. I visited my sister in Pittsburgh last week, and she brought me here, because it is one of her favorite restaurants. I can see why. The food at Noodlehead is outstanding.   To start with, we shared an order of spring rolls and an order of summer rolls. The spring rolls were crisp and not greasy and were packed with flavor. The summer rolls were fresh and went well with the earthy peanut sauce that accompanied the dish.   For my main course, I ordered the Street Noodle 1 (rice noodles, fried chicken, bok choy, cilantro) with a spice level of 4 out of 5. Everything about this dish was great. The sauce was really flavorful and very spicy. There was plenty of chicken and bok choy (I feel like noodle dishes at some places have a paucity of meat and veggies and tons of noodles; not the case here). I would highly recommend this dish.   The service at Noodlehead was really great too. We didn't have to wait long at all for any of our dishes.   Some other important things about Noodlehead: -It's BYOB, which is awesome. -They only take cash. They do have an ATM though.   If you are looking for great Thai food, you should absolutely check out Noodlehead.",

    "text": "I came here on a Monday with a friend and we had to wait for 15-20 minutes, as we expected. The ambiance and decor isn't really my style, and the patrons were definitely not the kind I was expecting (aka it wasn't full of asians). It's a loud place, and seems to resonate with hip white yuppies especially with their cheap BYOB policy. The hostess brought us to our table with a pitcher of water she grabbed from a fridge, but I think it was in there for about 5 minutes because the place is busy and my friend and I sat there drinking some lukewarm tap water which sucked since we had to walk pretty far in some hot sticky weather.  For the starters, or \"snacks\" as they call them, just get the pork belly steamed buns. They are the highlight of this restaurant. ********THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF MY REVIEW SO I WILL SAY THIS AGAIN, IF YOU ARE SITTING IN THIS RESTAURANT AND HAVE SEARCHED THE REVIEWS HERE WITH THE KEYWORD SNACKS BECAUSE YOU ARE DECIDING WHICH ONE TO GET, GET THE PORK BELLY STEAMED BUNS. PORK BELLY STEAMED BUNS!!!!******** They're amazing, even if they just look like a white pacman pillow with some cucumbers and a lot of pork. You only get 2 for $6, and I would have rather just had it for my whole meal if it was like 4 for $10 or something, but $3 each for a whole meal is too steep. $2.50 each is steep too but whatever, they really are just that good. You can BYOB but they also have some non-alcoholic drinks that are rather expensive. My friend got a bottle of Mexican coke (which is made with cane sugar instead of blah blah whatever i don't remember it just tastes like coke) and it was $3 and really small, like 355 ml small.  For the actual noodle part of my meal, I got the pad thai because I love pad thai and this is a thai place. I usually like it with pork but this place only offers chicken, shrimp, and tofu so I picked chicken. It was honestly very underwhelming for a pad thai dish (I have had pad thai at many places around the world). The sauce was not very flavorful and the chicken was not exciting either. If there were peanuts or eggs in the dish I did not notice them. I'll get something different the next time I come here and stick to another location for pad thai. It was a huge dish, though. My friend got beef noodle soup which was pretty good. It's a simple dish with beef, noodles, and soup that was pretty good. The noodles are very thin noodles and the beef is yummy and tender and didn't have weird mystery bits. I could eat the portion for this in one sitting unlike the pad thai. We both got them at a 0 because we are babies who don't like spicy food, so maybe that would have made the pad thai better but food really should be acceptably delicious at a 0 if you're offering a scale.  If I came here alone, I would give this place 3 stars because it was loud, my dish was lame, but the pork belly buns were really, really, REALLY good. Since my friend's beef noodle soup was good I will give it 4 stars but I'll definitely get something different if I end up there again and leave the pad thai to other places around Pittsburgh.  ~Dish Ratings~ Pork Belly Steamed Buns - 5/5 Pad Thai w/ Chicken - 2.5/5 Beef Noodle Soup 4/5",

    "text": "***BYOB, CASH ONLY***  Good ambiance, good food, and GREAT prices. I had been counting down days to get to Pittsburgh to try Noodlehead and finally had a chance to try it last night. We got there around 7pm on a Thursday night and the restaurant was buzzing. There was a 20 minute wait outside and the entire restaurant was packed.   The first thing you'll notice is that the restaurant is very hip - good lighting and nice decor on the inside, and it's fairly loud. The restaurant is also huge - especially compared to NY. I can only compare it to the size of The Smith... So, the restaurant being packed like this is a good sign. It's also cash only and BYOB, and there's a wine/liquor store 2 blocks from the restaurant.   The menu is short and sweet. There are two types of noodles - one section has a no substitution rule, which I am 100% on board with. The other section are the popular noodles: pad kee mao, pad see ew, and pad thai. All entrees are $9. All entrees has a spice level you can choose, from 0-5. Trust the spices; these are True Thai spices. 5 is VERY spicy. You have been warned!!  We ordered the pork puns, and then pad kee mao (spice level 4 and 5), Chiang Mai curry (spice level 4), and pad see ew (spice level 3). The pork buns were a little disappointing, as they were made from pulled pork as opposed to a traditional pork belly. The entrees were all very good and very fresh. Good portions and good spice levels.   The notable dish at Noodlehead was the Chiang Mai curry. It is simply amazing! The curry was so rich and the noodles were cooked perfectly. The flavors are all pronounced. I would definitely suggest getting the Chiang Mai curry.  If you're in Pitt, GO HERE! A plus is that the popular Millie's Homemade Icecream is right next door.",

It has dark wood walls that gave off a rustic vibe. The metal tables and chairs gave off a industrial vibe. They all go very well together.   For starters, we ordered the pig wings because we were intrigued by the name. My sister ordered Pad Thai with shrimp and I got the Kee Mao with tofu. We both ordered our dishes with level 4 spicy level which translated into Thai hot. The pig wings were okay, nothing memorable. They were basically just short ribs and were a little too dry for my taste. But the stars of the show were definitely the noodles. My Kee Mao was delicious and so was my sister's Pad Thai. I love that both dishes came with plenty of veggies. They were both cooked with the perfect spice level. That was a True definition of a Thai hot spice level. We both love eating spicy and were not disappointed.   The servers here were super nice, upbeat and friendly. Service was very quick.   Overall, I highly recommend this place if you are looking for good noodles. Each noodle dish was only $9 and came with generous portions. This just cannot be beat!",

The flat rice noodles are always cooked just right with flavor.  I wish they had a beef option; you can only choose from tofu, chicken or shrimp.  I recommend the shrimp as I did not like the chicken as much.  The tofu is okay.  Also, the better half likes the street noodle #2.  The tempura shrimp and thin noodles have just enough zing with the small pool of fish sauce on the bottom on the noodles.    Two things I ask for:  level 1 spice and add scallions.   The level 1 spice is just right whereas 2 is getting to the point you have to drink water as you eat, it really builds up!  After the meal, Millie's Ice Cream is next door if you please.",

    "text": "Man, it's been a minute since I've been here! My coworkers and I used to come here ALL THE TIME, but over the past 2-3 years we have all moved on to different jobs that are out of the area so it is a lot more difficult to get everyone together at the same time.  Ok enough ranting.. let's talk about the service. It could be better. Sometimes you feel like a bother, some times they just put your food down and walk away, and sometimes you get a pleasant hostess/wait staff. Tonight, my friend and I had a great experience. The hostess was kind and our waitress was super friendly without being overbearing.  I always save the best for last.. THE FOOD. There is a reason why the line is out the door on a Monday night.  As a matter of fact, while I was waiting to be seated, a gentleman walked by and said, \"it's a hopping joint!\" This place serves good food at an affordable price. I don't think there is anything on the menu that I haven't had, but I always find myself debating between the Chang mai curry and the pad see ew. Both are very different from each other, but are very tasty and filling. As far as the appetizers go.. get the steam buns. Hands down. They are heavenly!    Three important tips to remember.. 1. It's BYOB. - hook, line, sinker! Sign me up any day or should I say, everyday. 2. If you have booze, you can't sit outside. Rules are rules. 3. It's cash only - they do have an ATM in the back, but I'm not sure of what the fee is to use it.   Overall, I highly recommend. I bet if they did pineapple fried rice they would even give Thai me up a run for their money.",

Here are a few dishes that I get to enjoy  1. the Sukuthai has a really balanced flavor and sourness. Meatballs in there are delicious and juicy!  2. The Honey lemongrass iced tea is okay. A little bit bland but it sure does cool you down instantly from all the heat  3. This Pad See Yew with tofu might be my favorite pad see yew I've had for awhile!   Ps: if you can take the heat, get a least level 4,5 crazy spicy to really get the .   Overall I'd say this is a must visit restaurant if you are in Pittsburgh and if you love Thai food!",

On top of that, there's only a 50 cent recycling fee for BYOB and no corkage fee!  Some of mine and my friends' favorites include their Thai fried chicken and pork belly buns for apps, and their Pad Thai, Chang Mai, Street Noodle #1, and See Ew for entrees. However, they've pretty much perfected their menu, so I'm sure you'll be satisfied with any dish you get!  Something to be aware of is that they don't take reservations, and sometimes there can be a really long wait. But don't panic! There's a wine and spirits right down the street for you to pick up some wine for dinner, or a fantastic ice cream place called Millie's right next door. Take your pick!",

I want to say upfront that the food here is by no means bad in any way, shape, or form, but its just so generic. I got the Street Noodle (I think) #1 with a side of spring rolls at spice level 4 and it really just tasted like a standard fast-food Chinese joint, albeit with more spice because they were supposed to be Thai food. Now with that said the food is pretty cheap which is probably due to the fact that its a cash only business, so it seems more like a get what you pay for type of thing rather than a rip-off or waste of money. That being said, I can't really recommend this place, nor can I say to stay away, its just kind of, well, there.",

They are seriously out of this world and perfect to split. As far as noodles, the Kee Mao with tofu (they have meat options, too, don't worry) was the first thing that I tried at Noodlehead. Even if you're not a big tofu fan, their's is cooked perfectly and goes well with the other ingredients in this dish really well. Highly recommended. For something a bit more saucy, my other two favorites are the Chiang Mai Curry and the Green Curry Linguine. Honestly, though, you can't go wrong at this place.   A few important things: they don't take reservations and it can be packed around dinner time, alcohol is BYOB with a very small \"recycling\" fee, and it's cash only which is less of a big deal now that they have their own ATM. Service is not always the friendliest, but, given the price and style of the place, it's nothing to be bothered by.  Go to Noodlehead. Seriously, you won't regret it.",

    "text": "It's a smaller menu which is great for indecisive people like me. It's got a small variety of appetizers, and we chose the grilled beef and pork belly buns. The grilled beef has quite a kick to it which I didn't expect at all. I guess I didn't look at the menu closely enough. It was good, but I believe there is a good amount of spicy green peppers in it. The pork belly buns were very yummy.   I got the pad kee mao with shrimp (usual spicy level for it is medium because it's in a spicy basil sauce already, I just went with that). WOW it was spicy haha. It was so good though, I just kept drinking a lot of water. Next time I should get the pad see ew (sweet soy sauce based) with a spice level of 2-3 instead maybe. All in all, delicious food, and they're doing the Thai spicy right.   The chill vibe inside was nice, and the service was very good. I enjoyed my food a lot, the only thing is that it's quite a large portion of noodles (tasted very fresh!) so I didn't finish it. I wish I had a bigger stomach to eat it all haha. I'll definitely be back when I'm in Pittsburgh.",

My friend and I both had Street Noodles #1--me at spicy 1 and her at spicy 3. I found that the description on the menu was misleading as spicy 1 was VERY spicy. The spice factor probably varies depending on who makes it, but the first few bites were like a mouth fire. The chicken was good quality, white meat breast but the breading was soggy, which isn't my preference. It was still tasty and a good comfort food fried chicken. Noodles were your standard pad thai flavors (even if this isn't the case, that's how the dish tasted to me) of fish sauce, kaffir limes, etc. I thought the portion was generous and I'd go back if I were in the area, but you can get the same thing (maybe with sauteed chicken instead of fried) from any Thai restaurant in town. I found it very pretentious that they don't have a phone and are cash only. To top it off, they charge a fee for takeout (0.35 per item) without telling you about it (I noticed it on my receipt after the fact). I'm going down a negative path here, but I don't hate Noodlehead; I just wasn't impressed.",

The waiter brought us a fresh bottle of cold Pittsburgh H2-uh O and our menus.  I had my eyes set on the pork buns and dumplings. We also ordered the Shrimp pad thai and Spring rolls. Our waiter offered spices in the dish or on the side for a good reason, so we opted for some on the side. Shortly after our orders were placed, the food arrived piping hot and fresh. The pork buns were perfect, tender, flavorable and not enough. The dumplings melted right in my mouth and were also full of flavor.  The spring rolls were still very hot, crunchy, flaky, packed full of deliciousness. Finally, the Shrimp pad thai was one of the best I've had, with a good portion size.  There were mounds of moist, flavor filled noodles, complimented with the right amount of sauces, shrimp, fried eggs and bean sprouts. We tried a tad bit of the hot spices, which hit the mouth cavity with stabbing pains, cleared the sinuses and watered the eyes for a bit. So whether you eat in or take out, this is truly a good spot for some of the best thai in the Burgh.",

Getting a table here with a group can be a problem on the weekend because they don't take reservations, so come early or eat late. The menu is small enough that you'll be able to decide what you want pretty quickly, and it's hard to go wrong. My personal favorite is the Sukothai, a lighter alternative to most of the other dishes on the menu. The noodle soup is topped with bean sprouts, an egg, some vegetables, and crispy wonton strips, and is the perfect dish for a cold winter day. If you're feeling more traditional, the Pad Kee Mao and the Chiang Mai Curry are both delicious dishes that are a little more hearty.",

My boyfriend loves the steamed pork buns; I, on the other hand, am not a big fan of pulled pork. For those that need gluten-free options, this place can accommodate on almost all items. BYOB as other mentioned, and there is a mandatory $0.50 \"recycling fee\" (even if you take home half-emptied bottles). I've also ordered take-out before: They fill your order super fast, but it definitely tastes better when you eat there.  Keep in mind the No's and you'll be taken great care of: no credit cards, no reservations, no delivery and no phone number to call. They also do not seat until your entire group has arrive (something to keep in mind as parking can get tricky in the neighborhood).",

I ordered the Shrimp dish, and while it had a ton of fried shrimp, the dish was totally lacking in any synergy that made it feel like a dish. It was a combination of bulky food textures that were not consumable at once and really brought the experience down.  Fried shrimp,a mass of noodles, and sauteed bok choy with peppers doesn't make a good dish. You couldn't eat it together..the textures simply didn't mesh well. Furthermore, the flavor profile wasn't there either. Very let down.  The tea was nice btw.  p.s. this place is not really veg friendly.",

I ordered the See Yew and the rice noodles were perfectly cooked, the chicken wasn't dry, and the broccoli was perfectly bite-sized.  Oh, and it wasn't too salty (why are noodle dishes always too salty?!?). Also, the 5-point spicy scale seems to be exactly what it says it is. I asked for a Medium spice level (3) and it was slightly more than a kick, pleasantly surprising.   The restaurant wasn't too crowded (it was a Monday night) and our party of 5 had plenty of room around us to feel like we had our privacy.  The only bad thing I could say was that the restaurant has dim lighting so the picture of my See Yew didn't turn out nicely. *crymyselfariver*",

With some of the other reviews indicating that the place usually gets busy for dinner service, I was surprised to walk in and see only a few other parties inside (and one party at one of the two outside tables).  Service was really fast and friendly from the moment I walked in the door. For $12 and change, I got their Street Noodle #1 and a glass of lemongrass and honey iced tea. For a quite warm afternoon, the tea is refreshing with just the right amount of honey to not overpower the delicate citrus taste from the lemongrass. Street Noodle #1 is rice noodles and baby boc choy in a chili, fish sauce, and cilantro sauce, all topped with a crispy thai fried chicken cutlet. The sauce was especially tasty and in True Thai cuisine, the spices didn't only contribute heat, but a significant amount of flavor. This time I only got it medium spiciness (level 2 on a scale of 0-5), but next time, I'll definitely go up a notch or two. Also what was surprising is that the sauce tasted like it contains palm sugar, a more richer sweetness than plain sugar. The Thai Fried Chicken was juicy, while preserving a light and crunchy battered crust. The chicken alone is something worth coming to this place for for, even with their stand-out noodles.",

    "text": "This was an easy 5 stars for what it is.  It is a cash only homemade noodle joint that serves delicious food at a very reasonable price.  It's 'nice' enough for dinner out with friends and the BYOB policy makes it a fun evening.  But it's inexpensive enough for a weeknight fix. The food is definitely crave-able.  I've been a few times now and the food and service have been consistently great...although I have not tried a friday or saturday night when it's crazy busy. I love the pork belly steamed buns and the See Yew.  My husband loves the Pad Thai and I have heard great things about the Chiang Mai Curry from friends.  The noodles, meat and veggies are fresh.  Importantly for me the meat and veggies are not overcooked as they can often be in noodle dishes.  The portions are large and definitely left me enough for lunch the next day (and kept well to the next day).",

However, the food is somewhat pricey, and as I'm comparing it to our other Thai favorites, the food is not really better. Only the ambiance is superior.  My daughter loves the pad Thai, and I like the See Ew, but we can get those dishes at other places. Nothing special. Bloomfield delivers the goods better plus you can get a great curry dish to go with it!  My husband likes Street Noodles #1. I couldn't eat the fried chicken part (gluten allergy), but I tried the sauce, I have to agree that it rocked.",

I think you get either three or four for $4?  I know they are reasonable for the quality.  The meat is very tender and clean with a nice flavor.  They also have amazing pork belly with steamed buns.  It may sound like a strange dish but I'm hooked.  This is the only place I've ever had pork belly.  It just sounds so unappealing but for the price, I figured I'd try them.  They are ridiculously good.   I only gave this place four stars because I'm not a huge fan of most of the entrees I've tried.  Their pad thai is really good though.    Just remember to bring cash and to be prepared to wait when the weather is nice.  There are only three or four outdoor tables but the inside is decorated nicely too.",

I had the Chiang Mai Curry, it was presented nicely and hade great aroma and flavor accompanied by just the right amount of heat( spiciness level) I went with medium and it was easily handled by my mouth. I also tried the hot pulled pork bun appetizer which also was tasty but hard to only eat one so if you are sort of hungry maybe plan to not hate this app.  The only thing that was sort of irritating was the seating arrangements. I'm in Pittsburgh, not Chiang Mai, so I didn't appreciate sitting on the mildly uncomfortable stool with no back to it. The design was thoughtful but I need some better sitting options. It was also way too cold even after eating my curry. A number of people in the place kept their coats on since it was so chilly. Anyhow I would come back here again for lunch or a lighter dinner, since the food is tasty, service was quick, and the price is right.",

I don't find it annoying at all that it's cash only and in-person only, the latter emphasizes the importance of social dining.

The interior design of Noodlehead is rustic and industrial, which contrasts with the atmosphere when I eat those offering dishes back home. Most of the noodle dishes are the foods that Thai people eat daily and they are easily found from every corner of the streets in Thailand. Love Boat with Thai hot level of spiciness was my first dinner after hitting the town. It was wow, better than the one back home. I came later and ordered Kee Mao with shrimp. Substituting from big flat rice noodles to thin rice noodles was one customization I made. Once again, it still tasted better than food back home. Even though the atmosphere is different than what you would expect in Thailand, if you want an authentic taste of Thai street noodles, here is the place for you.  It's BYOB and cash only, so keep that in mind.",

    "text": "Me and my wife were in the mood for something different and we wanted to try out Noodlehead.  We thought we were in for something different and different we got.    The place is a small neighboorhood place which was decorated sparsely in a modern theme.    First of all we came there for lunch, just a fair warning there are no lunchtime pricing.  It is all one price and that is all there is.  Also bring cash because cash isn't only king there it's the only show.  No need to ask for Debit or Credit neither one applies here.  Seating reminds me of a sardine can with everyone squished together.  Plus forget chairs with backs on them nope better enjoy stools.   The waiting staff was terrible.  She didn't explain what the sauces we on this table and to this day I still wonder what they were.  We asked for more napkins and they sullenly arrived like each one was 10 dollars out of her paycheck.  We tried the two street noodle dishes one was Thai fried chicken.  This dish I found to be overly watery the noodles were meh and the dish was alright and spicy.  The other one their best dish was really delicious noodles with wonderful shrimp tempura.  This is your best bet.  Spiciness, now we asked for a 1 on a scale of 1 to 5 and it was to me like a 3.  Everything was spicy.  I mean even dumplings were all spicy.  Now there's those that really like it spicy, you'll have a great time here.  For myself if I say one, well give me a dash of spice and leave it at that.  No need to burn my tongue off at a 1.  On the positive from this I drank more water that day than I did the rest of the week.  Overall I give it a 3/5 something that was to try.",

The overall ambiance of the restaurant is very relaxed with cool interior decor and lower lighting. For an appetizer we ordered the Steamed Pork Dumplings and thought they were great. For the main meal, I ordered the Pad Thai with chicken with no spiciness (because the waitress warned me that their spices were very hot), so she brought a little dish of the spices on the side for me to add to my liking. The prices are reasonable (cash only), everything was delicious, and there was enough food to take home leftovers for dinner the next night.

I don't actually remember why I didn't like it in the first place but their noodle dishes are always scrumptious and I can't wait to go back and try some noodle soups!   p.s.

Today, the waitress's attitude angered us. There's no greeting when she came to us, no introduction of herself as well. She never smiled when serving us. However, for another table, she welcomed them with warm attitude and smile. She even said nothing when we said thank you to her for bringing the food. Just do the necessary thing and then leave.

When she said that Thai was one of our nearby options, I voted yes, but sighed when I thought about how much it would cost me to cover dinner. But everything is so reasonably priced here! And the menu wasn't crazy complicated.  We ordered the pork dumplings, she got the soup ($6), and I got the Pad See Ew (my absolute favorite - $9). They allow you to customize the level of spicy for each dish, and I am really grateful that our waitress warned us that their chili flakes are a lot spicier than we may be used to because I ordered my food at a level of 3/5 and my nose was running. And I choked a little bit after the first bite. But it was all so good. lol  The portions are huge, so we left there very satisfied.   Cash only, but there is an ATM nearby.

I've been coming here for 1.5 years and I still order the same thing every time because it is just too good (the See Yew with shrimp spice level 1). I've also tried street noodle 1 and 2 and they are also fantastic. Those are the only things I order because I can't get myself to not eat them when I go. I will say the spice level is slightly inconsistent. I am not sure if the kitchen just eyeballs it or if each chef does it differently but I have found that on some trips a spice level 2 could be manageable for me or totally too spicy. So I now stick with spice level 1 because despite the risk of inconsistency I can't probably handle it no matter what. Service here is really good. They are quick even when packed and are nice about giving you change since they will not split the bill (note). BYOB is so great and makes a trip here super fun with friends ! They are usually super super packed on weekend evenings and even during the week day as it gets warmer outside. But wait time is almost always a lot less than the host tells you which is awesome.

Definitely go in knowing your spice tolerance.  I'm a huge fan of the flat noodles, so I always get Kee Mow or Pad See Yew. It's always very flavorful, and the spiciness never drowns out the flavor. They give very generous portions and don't skimp out on the meat. Their vegetables are cooked well, just the right amount of crunch. This place is also very affordable, only $9 per noodle dish! I usually take home leftovers for a second meal, unless I'm starving that day.  The interior is really chill and it's a great place to bring a date or grab a meal with friends. It's also cash only, and BYOB.   The unfortunate thing is that getting here can be a pain without a car. (71B comes only so often). Furthermore, this place can get really popular and I've had to wait 30-45 minutes here more than once. Also, they don't have a lot of variety in dishes. It's mostly just dry noodles, soupy noodles, and some appetizers.   Anyways, come here if you love spicy food, thai noodles, great prices, and awesome environments/service.",

If you're looking for a class Shadyside meal for not too much, this is a good option.",

I loved how fresh the broccoli was in my meal. We also got the pulled pork buns which are really hard to describe. My friend calls them \"little clouds\" because they're so soft. They were delicious, however you explain them!  My only complaint is that I ordered 0 on the spice scale because I'm a wimp. My friend got 1 but often gets a 2, she wasn't feeling too crazy. We both ordered the same meal but she also got hers with no egg and upon eating, we realized they got hers right with no egg but that they spiced ours opposite. She wanted more heat and I was definitely thinking mine tasted more spicy than I'd prefer. Small mistake but had she ordered a 2 like she usually does and had it been served to me, I probably wouldn't have been able to eat it.",

I've tried the steamed buns and the chiang mai noodles.  Those buns were good as good as any bao I've had anywhere else.  The chiang mai noodles - noodles drowning in an excellent coconut curry - were also very good.    But there are other Thai joints in Pittsburgh with curries just as good (or better) at the same price, like the Smiling Banana Leaf, whose curries usually contain huge chunks of flavorful vegetables accompanied by rice instead of noodles.  Plus the the other Thai places smile upon their customers by giving them more payment options, like plastic.",

    "text": "Noodlehead has got to be one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh. The only thing that would make it better was if they offered delivery. They don't have much on the menu, but everything they do offer can't be beat. I personally love their kee mao. I get it at a 5 spice level with chicken and it is my favorite meal to eat. I could eat it everyday. The spice level is pretty hard to gauge. If you don't like anything spicy, get a 0. 1 packs a small punch. 4 and 5 are pretty much the same. Also, depending on the day, a 5 can be a good spice level or it can be solid fire. It really depends on which cook is making your food. Also, unless you have a small party group (2), try and get there earlier or later, rather than during the typical lunch rush. There's no reservations and no call aheads (no phone period) so the wait is usually around 45 minutes or longer on a weekend night. My personal favorite way to Noodlehead is to order takeout. They now have an online order form which is perfect. I just place the order there and then pick it up. No waiting in the busy entryway and I can enjoy my food with all my friends on Friends on the TV. Dining in is also a great experience though. The service is fast and they keep the water coming. Plus, Millie's is right next door for a post-dinner snack.  Noodlehead is the best place for a meal in Pittsburgh",

Once we were seated, the waiter promptly came over to open our wine and take our order. He was friendly; however it was very loud inside the establishment so I had a difficult time hearing what he was asking/saying to us.   We ordered two appetizers. The spring rolls and the steam buns. I only had a spring roll and it was delicious. Crispy on the outside and flavorful on the inside. Our main entrees arrived shortly after our appetizers. I had the beef soup with a spicy level of 3. This is comparable to Nicky's spice level of 6 or 7 (if anyone was wondering). The beef was soft and melted in my mouth. The broth was packed full of flavor. The noodles were thin and easy to pick up with the chop sticks.   Overall, I loved the food. The only reason I'm not giving noodlehead five stars is because it was so loud inside and I had to struggle to hear my date and the waiter at times.",

    "text": "Thai food with a fresh and modern atmosphere! I tried this place for the first time with a couple friends as an end-of-the-semester celebration. The moment I stepped into this restaurant, I noticed the minimalist decor with warm lighting, and felt that it bordered the casual-intimate atmosphere. We were seated and given the menu. I've grown accustomed to flipping through endless pages in menus of other Thai restaurants and becoming increasingly frustrated in narrowing down my choices to three dishes, and then narrowing those down to one. Occasionally, I would have to tell my waiter/waitress to come back for me later after the rest of my party had ordered, then still spend several minutes after we devoured our appetizers to decide on my main dish. Thus, I was pleasantly surprised to see such a short menu: four appetizers, two $6 noodle dishes, and eight $9 noodle dishes. For the first time in...ages...I was able to order my meal in my first interaction with the waiter/waitress (cue the confetti and sparklers!).  Most of my friends ordered Chicken Pad Thai with their level of spiciness customized to their liking. I went rogue and ordered Chicken Kee Mao with a medium-level spiciness. The presentation of the food was nothing special, just a delicious heap of noodles and chicken in a bowl. I just cared for the taste, and wow, was it tasty--and, do I dare say, SPICY! The first couple mouthfuls were bearable, but after, my tongue could barely withstand any more insult. While my friends were devouring (i.e. slurping) their noodles, I was gulping down water and cursing my poor excuse of an Asian tongue. Eventually, my friends broke out of their noodle-induced stupor and noticed my half-eaten bowl. Grudgingly, I explained my situation. They tried a bite or two of my dish and they immediately reached for their glasses of water. I let out a sigh of relief, realizing that it was not my tongue playing tricks on me. I tried a bite of their dish and it was delicious!  So, I would have given five stars had my own dish not been overwhelmingly spicy. Well, I suppose I learned my lesson. No pain, no gain...right?  BTW, this restaurant is CASH-only. Also, BYOB, with a $0.50 corking fee per person.",

The selection is somewhat limited but they have all the staple noodle dishes.   The spice chart goes from 1-5. This time u got a 3 and it was about perfect for me. If you are used to the 1-10 scale the 3 is like a7-8.   Thus place is great for a casual meal just make sure you bring cash! There is an ATM if you forget to bring cash.",

Everything looks so fresh and the atmosphere is really great.   There are a variety of table configurations including: small tables where one side is a booth and the other has a chair, long picnic table, countertop with bar stools, big round tables on giant barrels with higher chairs... This variety gives some great personality!  The service was fast and efficient when we arrived at about 3pm on a Sunday. We were greeted and served promptly!!   The table set up is cute. Glasses are ready for you and they drop off a carafe of cool water. Love that! There was also a basket with napkins, a bottle of siraccha, and a container with forks, spoons, and chopsticks. When they brought the check, they brought it in a cute little woven basket. Love the attention to detail!   We ordered love boat noodle soup and kee mao. I made good use of the fork to get the noodles onto my spoon and then dunked t for the broth. I love noodle soups! The beef was also cut in very bite-appropriate sizes and I was impressed at its tenderness. It's a dark, rich broth and lots of fresh basil. I liked it!   The kee Mao boasts those incredible wide noodles. I love their texture! It was very tasty, although I have had more flavorful versions elsewhere.  We both got spicy level 2 \"medium\" and we were happy with that!   I would absolutely return and try some additional dishes here. I hope to bump this place up to 5 when I return. It's close, but not quite there yet for me. Still.. Go and check it out!!   Highlights: Good food Great employees Exceptional atmosphere/decor  Don't forget it is byob and there is outdoor seating.   Also, The menu is not overwhelming. Just a few key items for each category. Which is nice.   Bring CASH! They do not accept credit cards. Although there is an atm there, the menu said.   Wish I could have gotten better photos. Next time! ;)",

This most recent visit was not as eventful, but it sure was tasty!! I usually tend to go for the Pad Thai, but this time I went for the See Yew. This dish had egg, broccoli, chicken, big ol' rice noodles all on some tasty black sweet soy sauce. Boy, let me tell ya this was delightful!! I had a taste of the Chiang Mai Curry, which was good, but a little too spicy for my taste.   Either way you can't go wrong with this place. The price is right, the decor on point, and the service was outstanding. The servers had great suggestions which helped me a fair bit since I don't like spicy food. Overall great experience and would come back again!",

We (the young uns and I) got one order, scarfed it down, then got another. Eyes crossed and drool a'flowed around the table.  But I digress.  Once our rhapsody over the aforementioned treat had waned a bit, we each had noodles of various sorts--one kid had shrimp pad thai, one had street noodles with chicken, and I had street noodles with tempura shrimp. ALL were terrific, satisfying, and deliciously hot on a chilly November afternoon.  Noodlehead is a non-alcohol joint, but has a good selection of cane sugar-sodas (Mexican Coke, Fanta and such) and they keep chilled bottles of water coming. Oh! And they're CASH ONLY (there is an ATM in the back, which I can confirm because I had to use it).  It's a chill, unassuming place that comes without an ounce of pretense. Really enjoyed it and will definitely go back!",

    "text": "When I first walked into this restaurant, I was pretty concerned -- the place looked hypermodern, hip, and just screamed \"I spend way too much time on my looks and not nearly enough on my food\".  Fortunately for me, that impression was way off; Noodlehead serves up a small but incredibly competent menu of some of the most authentic Thai noodle dishes I've had in Pittsburgh.  Color me pleasantly surprised!  Unlike most Asian places I've been to in Pittsburgh, Noodlehead knows its core competency, nails it, and never apologizes for it.  This is a welcome change -- most supposedly Asian restaurants in the area don't (at least in my humble judgment) seem to *have* a core competency to speak of (or are very confused about what said competency is, to say the least).  At Noodlehead, it's noodles, noodles, and more noodles.  The menu is so limited that it could comfortably fit on a 3-by-5 index card -- and every single item is worth eating.  My favorite is the Kee Mao (at other Thai restaurants, you'll find it called 'Drunken Noodle', 'Drunkard Noodle', etc.).  The veggies are fresh, the wide noodles are just right, and the seasoning is heavenly -- as good as any I've had elsewhere.  I also like how their spice scale is actually useful: I find the 5/5 spicy indeed, the 4/5 a distinct step down, and so forth.  And, since THIS!  IS!  PITTSBURGH!, the portions are (a) served on dishes the size of hubcaps and (b) absolutely enormous.  Highly recommended!",

With some of the other reviews indicating that the place usually gets busy for dinner service, I was surprised to walk in and see only a few other parties inside (and one party at one of the two outside tables).  Service was really fast and friendly from the moment I walked in the door. For $12 and change, I got their Street Noodle #1 and a glass of lemongrass and honey iced tea. For a quite warm afternoon, the tea is refreshing with just the right amount of honey to not overpower the delicate citrus taste from the lemongrass. Street Noodle #1 is rice noodles and baby boc choy in a chili, fish sauce, and cilantro sauce, all topped with a crispy thai fried chicken cutlet. The sauce was especially tasty and in True Thai cuisine, the spices didn't only contribute heat, but a significant amount of flavor. This time I only got it medium spiciness (level 2 on a scale of 0-5), but next time, I'll definitely go up a notch or two. Also what was surprising is that the sauce tasted like it contains palm sugar, a more richer sweetness than plain sugar. The Thai Fried Chicken was juicy, while preserving a light and crunchy battered crust. The chicken alone is something worth coming to this place for for, even with their stand-out noodles.",

Occasionally we have gone for dinner and while there are long wait lines, they allow you to begin drinking your wine while you wait AND it is totally worth it.

Love the decor, super cool. I do want to point out that it was pretty loud in here. Keep that in mind if this is a first date, lol.  First, we ordered 2 orders of spring rolls (2/ order, $3.50). They were a great app and i loved the sauce.   For dinner, bobby ordered street noodles #1 (chicken) & I ordered street noodles #2 (shrimp). I had mine at a spice level of 2/5 & my bf chose 4/5. We enjoyed out noodles. The portion size was perfect. I'm a weakling and enjoyed my 2 spice level. My bfs was a 4 and I tried some. Still bearable even for me (of course, i only had two bites. Doubt I could finish a whole plate of 4 spice level). The sauce was great- tangy yet also sweet.  For drinks, I stuck with water that they bring to the table.. although I asked for ice Bc it wasn't cold and no ice was offered initially. My bf stick went with a coke (glass bottle) . they are BYOB so next time we will bring some wine :)  We really enjoyed Noodlehead. I look forward to trying their Chiang Mai curry dish, which is also popular. Another joint in the burg is still my #1 Thai place but I do believe noodlehead is solid 4 stars.   **Cash Only. - ATM on site.",

His was supposed to be spicy and mine not at all instead I got the spicy one. The pad Thai had almost no flavor besides the char flavor from the burned noodles and chicken. The noodles were also very oily and there were no peanuts?! I don't know if we just ordered the wrong thing off the menu but we probably won't be back.",

I normally get the Street Noodle 1 and it is so good, I have tried almost all their dishes and can easily say each has such good flavor and a unique kick to its own. The price is also unbelievable and worth it, nine bucks and I get two meals out of it (leftovers). It is also BYOB so it's such a cute spot for a nice date or girls night out. The inside is decorated very nicely and give this urban hipster vibe which set the aesthetics when you are eating their lovely food! Only thing just be careful with the spice level because they actually make it realistic and spice I normally get a 3 but with that my mouth is still burning and tough to eat sometimes.",

I'd say this appears to be a better lunch then dinner stop - though it is a BYOB, should you want to wash down your meal with some spirit either mid-day or at dinner time...or all the way through!  The menu offers noodle soups, \"street\" noodle dishes with no substitutions, and more noodles with either shrimp, chicken, or tofu.  Again...short, simple, and to the point as far as the menu is concerned.   Plus, they also offer some \"snacks\" that are best shared with your dining mates...to which I recommend the Pork Belly Steamed Buns, as they are a can't miss item.   All in all...this is a really good stop for some really good eats...you just better like noodles because that's pretty much all they've got...and they're dang good, too!",

We told our server I was a vegetarian and he ensured there would be no meat in my dish.  We started with the veggie spring rolls. I took a bite and the middle was completly frozen. Our waiter brought us a second batch that was hot, near burnt but at least the inside was cooked. I ordered the tofu and it was dry, chewy and tasted like it had been reheated 12 times.  I wouldn't reccomend this resturant to any vegetarian or vegan. I heard great reviews about this place but they fell extremely short. They are NOT ACCOMMADATING or dont  santaize well!

    "text": "Ok, so maybe this restaurant is a little difficult. BYOB, cash only, and they don't even have a phone. But the food here is SO GOOD that it's worth it! I dare you to find a more satisfying meal for under $20.   We started off with the sweet potato triangles ($4 for 6). These were piping hot fried wonton skins filled with pillowy mashed sweet potato. They came with the typical spring roll dipping sauce. Really tasty!  They serve about 8 different noodle dishes affordably priced at $9. There's a variety of chicken, beef, and shrimp options, but everything can be made with tofu. I had the pad see yew and my friend had the pad kee mao (similar to drunken noodles). The wide rice noodles were absolutely delicious and perfectly cooked! Both dishes had a ton of flavor and a generous portion of veggies and tofu mixed in.   One thing I noticed is that the heat levels were slightly different between the two dishes. You choose your desired spiciness and we both asked for medium. But because the see yew has a sweet black soy sauce, it was less spicy than the kee mao, which has a chili garlic sauce. So if you don't like spice, pay attention to the ingredients in your dish when you're ordering!  Our waitress was super friendly without being insincere. The atmosphere was really cool but overly so -- there seemed to be a lot of families and kids eating here too!  It's kind of too bad that they don't serve alcohol, but luckily there are a bunch of beer and wine stores in the area. BYOB is $0.50 per person. And the waitress was happy to provide us with a bottle opener!  I left here totally stuffed, but Noodlehead happens to be right next door to Millie's Homemade Ice Cream, another Pittsburgh gem. You can always walk around the neighborhood to digest before grabbing dessert!",

We went on a Saturday night so it was packed and it took awhile for us to get seated, so try to go at times where it's not as crowded.   The food is delicious! We were starving but didn't have to worry because the service was super fast.  We had food in no time. I got the Chiang Mai curry which was soooo good. There's also a hotness scale so if you don't like spicy food, you don't have to worry!  Just to be aware, make sure everyone in your party is there because we didn't know that. They sat us down but when they realized everyone wasn't there they made us get back up, so just making everyone aware to have their whole party there.",

Once we placed the order we had some time to kill, so we left and got a drink at a nearby bar while we were waiting and timing worked out well. We got the Street Noodle 2 (spice level 4), the shrimp was so delicious and the noodles had the best seasoning and flavor! Also we got the Chiang Mai curry (spice level 2). It is prepared exactly how the dish is in Thailand, the sauce is thin and I always get sauce everywhere because it's so good I just can't control myself haha. Next time we went, we brought our own booze on a Sunday night and waited for a table. We were in no rush, just going with the flow. The wait wasn't too bad, maybe 15-20 minutes. We got the Street Noodle 1 this time and the Pad See Ew. The service was pretty quick and our server was super friendly and fast. Again the dishes we got were so delicious!! I will say I loved the Street Noodle 2 a tiny bit more but both were great.  Note: others have complained about parking, but I love driving here because you can easily find nearby parking on side streets or streets that run parallel. You shouldn't have to walk more than 3-5 minutes tops unless you just struggle with city parking in general...",

So, they come off as slightly pretentious because they don't take cash, they don't have a telephone, and you cannot alter any meal..... That being said, with their meals being $9 bucks and the BYOB charge of a mere 50 cents, they're okay in my book. Ha.   The place itself has a really cool vibe. Modern with tons of different textures. A couple really cool seating options for larger parties (like a picnic table and whiskey barrel seats).   Definitely plan on a 20 minute wait, on average. They do have an ATM on site now.   I've gotten the SN #1 both times with a spice level of 1 or 2, and they were perfect. Friends have gotten the pad thai and green curry linguini with a spice level 3 and he was sweating, haha.   New favorite place!!",

And these are the tiniest dumplings I have been served. There were only 4. Totally unsatisfactory. I had ordered Shrimp Pad Thai for main course. I am keeping a shrimp out of that to compare the size for your reference.  The service was bad too. When I entered it was peak lunch time. There was a queue till outside of the restaurant. I checked with them if they were standing for Pick-Up or for Seating. I was told they were all waiting to be seated. So, I went inside to check for Pick-Up.

I used to look forward to coming here due to the chills vibes and BYOB, but the noodle dishes are all starting to converge into an unremarkable and oily memory.   I've tried all the noodles off their limited menu (they really should consider diversifying or experimenting with some new dishes) and every single one is way too oily. I think people like to come here because they think it's special and the food comes out in enormous quantity. Admittedly, I used to bring visitors from outside of Pittsburgh here until I realized that nobody was ever impressed by this place.   For good Thai food, there are so many better places that are more authentic and interesting. The most interesting thing about Noodlehead is the industrial feel, which is a thing of the past if you live in any major city. Also the cash only policy is really pointless and negates the otherwise progressive environment that this restaurant desperately tries to exude.",

Our friend has the curry noodle dish (can't remember the name) but it was just as our dish, unflavorful. The only reason I would give this place a 2 star rating is for the service - the whole staff was extremely friendly and presented themselves very respectfully and professionally.

Parking is not ideal, it's in the city.. so plan to park on the street. Also, super small dark space which is nice and trendy but can get pretty crowded in the evenings!  Would recommend Noodlehead to anyone looking to have some good, and cheap food! Also, I always love BYOB restaurants, a $7 bottle of wine for dinner makes all the difference!",

The spice levels go from 0-5.  Experienced spice eaters only above level 3!    Noodlehead does not take reservations, so be prepared to wait during peak times. They are BYOB, and only charge a small recycling fee. I suggest bring wine to drink while you wait - I've waited an hour before (the food is that good)! They also don't have a phone, so you need to go in to order takeout. They are cash only, but do have an ATM. Their prices are all below $10!  Only negative would be that I have experienced mixed service during my visits at Noodlehead. Most servers are great, but I've found that a few are less than friendly.",

These 3 are all good, but be particular when choosing your spice level. I usually get at least a 3/5 but my most recent time I got a 1/5 and it was a lot spicier than I was expecting. With the growing popularity of this place, serving size has definitely gone down while they increased their prices.  Noodlehead is a decent, hipster Thai spot to go for a fun night out or a date but I hope you weren't expecting to have a conversation here, it can get loud. Cash only and its BYOB. (No byob if you're going to sit outside though.)",

Great for dates or taking the parents out to dinner when they're in town.   I ordered the green curry linguine and was satisfied. I would have preferred the sauce to be a little more thick, but it wasn't a huge impact. I thought the amount of noodles given was fine, but would have preferred a slightly larger portion.   pros -cheap -quick -everything I've ordered here tastes great (pad see yew, street noodle #1, green curry linguine)   cons -spice is just heat - not much flavor to it (and their scale is pretty drastic. Don't order a 4 or higher unless you really like heat) -this place is cash only -it is extremely busy during peak business hours and you can wait ~1 hour for a table",

Also they only accept cash, but there is an ATM on site. We arrived around 3PM and the place was popping. I can only imagine they are super packed during prime lunch/dinner hours.   Overall the food and flavors were delicious. Starting with apps, I did not enjoy the pork dumplings (too much of a mushy texture for me) or the pulled pork sandwich. That being said, my nephew loves the pork sandwich. I think, due to appearance I though they would taste like sui mai and Peking duck, very much not the case.  For entrees we ordered the below:  Chiang Mai Curry: loved the curry, but the noodles were a little tough. Saved the curry and had it over rice for leftovers at home. Yum!   Green Curry Linguini: absolutely delicious flavor with a little kick. Again, saved the curry sauce and had it again with rice at home ;) so good.   Beef soup: good flavor, tender pieces of beef.  Street Noodles: nothing to write home about.   Pad Sew Ew: YUUUUMMMM!!! Best dish we had.",

We came right at opening and had no trouble finding a seat. By the end of our meal the restaurant was crowded, which led to our waitress being a bit absent. We tried the steamed pork dumplings which were quite unappetizing. The pork seemed to be ground way too finely, so the filling tasted gummy and chewy. The street noodle 1 had a deliciously crispy fried chicken on top, but other than that tasted mostly of tamarind (or another similar flavor). The pad thai was extremely oily and mostly tasted like char. The dishes were all very one-note.",

I couldn't have asked for a better experience my second time coming. Oddly enough, we sat in the same exact hi-top as the first time we visited. The results were the same if not better.   The pork dumplings were served what seemed like seconds after we ordered and were hot and steamy. Order one of the noodles (Pad Thai is everyone's favorite but I suggest See Yew). The spicy meter is spot on (1-5, 5 being the spiciest).   Best part about Noodlehead, BYOB and no corkage fee!",

    "text": "I've been hearing the hype about Noodlehead for probably the past 5 years and finally had the chance to experience it for myself. It did not disappoint! I always get nervous when places don't take reservations (I have been known to get pretty hangry while waiting), and when we arrived, it was a 40 minute wait so not terribly long and definitely worth waiting for. But so many people ahead of us wound up leaving/not being present when their name was called, so we only waited like 10 mins! So pro tip - hang around the restaurant while you are waiting to be called! For eats, I ordered the See Yew with tofu (spice level 0) and my boyfriend went for the Street Noodle #1 (spice level 1) per highly rated Yelp reviews - we both loved our dishes! I loved the wide noodles and the broccoli in the dish, and the sweet black soy sauce was the perfect binder for all the flavors. I hate over-sauced dishes, so I was pleasantly surprised with the level of sauce on my See Yew. My boyfriend was definitely surprised by the flavors of his dish, but in a good way! The citrus flavor paired nicely with the crispy chicken, and the thinner noodles were the best vesicle to capture all the flavors. Of note, he ordered his as a level 1 spice, and it definitely had a kick - just be aware that they bring the spice! Normally we get an app, but I didn't notice the \"snack\" section on the back of the menu - perhaps would be better placed above the main dishes? But no big, we were more than full from our meal. Also love that it's BYOB AND they only charge 50 cents for corkage - more places should take after in PGH! Overall, Noodlehead is a great staple in the PGH restaurant scene, and we will definitely stop by again on future visits to the city :)",

One thing I like to place an takeout order over the phone better is that they usually have it ready fairly quick even sometimes the restaurant would say it will take 20-25 minutes. But the time available to choose from was at least half hour later. So that the food would not be fresh off the stove. But an online system does help smooth the ordering process.

The real reason I like it so much however is because of the extremely reasonable prices and the spice. If you really really like spicy noodles, this is the place to go. They have a scale of 1-5 and five is EXTREMELY hot but at the same time the heat does not diminish the flavor. This place will have you coming back again and again.",

You can easily make 2 meals out of the serving. I also had the pork dumplings which is great appetizer for whatever your meal is. It would even make a good midday snack. The pork was juicy and tender and the sauce that is paired with it was also a good compliment. I can't wait to come back and try everything on the menu.",

I highly recommend the street noodles and chiang mai curry (sometimes I eat the noodles then take the curry home and add rice to it to make 2 meals out of 1). You can expect to get stuffed here and leave extremely satisfied especially if you stop by Millie's ice cream next door for dessert.   It's usually crowded on Friday/Saturday nights so arrive early",

    "text": "Delicious food and the soups are very well priced!   $6.50 for a large bowl of delicious noodle soup? Can't really beat that. However, they only have 2 soup options. We got the love boat and although it says it's in a spicy broth, not the spicy lime broth, it seemed to have a lime flavor as well. For this, we only got the 2 spice level and it was pretty mild. Good flavor and overall a great dish.  We also ordered the $9.50 street noodle #1 with the thai fried chicken. It's a rice noodle dish with a light sauce on it so it doesn't sit heavy or make you feel groggy. It's refreshing and the crunch of the bean sprouts and chicken adds some texture. Again, got the level 2 spice and it was again, pretty mild.   Lastly, we ordered the $9.50 chiang mai curry. This dish is honestly more like a soup with the amount of curry they give. The curry wasn't super thick but definitely not the same as a clear broth soup. The coconut flavor isn't overpowering like it is at most other places, but it's still there. It comes served with like a crispy, dry noodle on the top. It adds a crunch but is a bit hard to eat since they don't break apart that easy, but there are also the soft egg noodles in the curry itself. It comes with plenty of chicken and it's a very filling dish. I ordered it with a level 4 spice and the heat builds but it's a great kind of heat and flavor that you often find in thai dishes.  Overall, the food was amazing, but their menu isn't that large. The dishes have the traditional thai flavors and it stays True to that and that's probably what causes the menu to be a bit smaller. The seating isn't great. They only have a couple floor-level tables and they seem to be for larger parties, the rest are high-top tables with tall stools. Also, keep in mind that they are CASH ONLY, so make sure you have cash on you, although they say they have an ATM on site for those who need it.",

Otherwise, if you want to come during a normal meal time, expect to put your name down, head down the street for a drink, and come back for dinner 1 - 2 hours later. They will call you when your table is almost ready, so no need to stick around while you wait.  My favorites are probably the See Yew and the Chiang Mai Curry (both with tofu) at spice level 2, but everything is delicious!",

The quickest ive every gotten food after ordering. Now before I get into the taste keep in mind ive never eaten Thai food before. This has been my first encounter with it and i honestly dont even know what i was expecting. But i was blown away! I took one bite of my pad Thai and was immediately in love. The spice was just right for my liking and the amount that you get per order is enough for two! My boyfriends street noodles were the bomb and honestly I think i liked his better. There was nothing wrong with mine I just prefered the taste of his dish. Overall our expieriance was fantastic and we will definitely be back again.",

    "text": "Noodlehead was a VERY delicious Thai restaurant! First off, it's CASH ONLY but they have an ATM in the restaurant. They are also BYOB. I came here with my friends and we all had a fabulous time. They do not take reservations and will only seat you when the entire party is present. We came here on a Thursday night and it was very busy, but we had a group of 8 and were seated at the back of the restaurant within 5 minutes because the large table was available for larger parties. My friends have all been here and some of them get Noodlehead once a week! I decided to finally try it and the food was delicious! I eat a lot, but the portion size was large and more than fair for the price. Because I knew the portion size was large, I had Pad See Yew with tofu and I split it with my friend. We ordered a spice level of 4 out of 5, but I actually had to add more sriracha (I love very spicy food)... I recommend that if you are sensitive to spice, you order less of a spice level because you can always add spice but not take it away. My friends and I also ordered the Cold Lemongrass Honey Iced Tea, which is only $2.50 and came with free refills. I highly recommend you get the tea... it was one of the best teas I have ever drank (not too sweet but flavorful and delicious). The service was a bit slow and the waiter was not the most attentive, but the restaurant was busy and the food made up for it. If you don't have time to wait, I suggest ordering takeout!",

I lucked out and got a parking spot right in front and was seated immediately. We started with the pork sticky buns (so good!) and I got the Chiang Mai Curry, and my mom got the Kee Mao. Both were really good, but my mom said hers was a bit too spicy, even when she asked for it to not be spicy. If I liked close, I'd return here. Waiters were friendly and the meal was very reasonably priced.",

Huge portion for being under $10 each dish.   1. Pad thai with shrimp with spciey level 2: Tons of shrimps, however I was questioning if they're frozen since they're small and had no flavour. Usually my paid Thai comes with fresh shrimp with the tail still on it, less shrimps but bigger shrimps. The noodles was all cut up which I don't like. You're suppose to have long noodlds for prosperity! Spicey level 2 was fine for me who can't handle spcieiness at all, just the right amount of kick. They did have the flavour after I added the lime juice to it. It was okay for a fast food kind of pad Thai but I've had better.   2. Pad kee mao with tofu and spicy level 5: Bf had this and rated it 2 stars. Had a bit of flavour but he said he had better. Said it wasn't spicey at all but he has a high tolerance. Tofu was cubes and didn't have much flavour, very bland. Had better food (in Thailand)   Overall, great spot for a fast food style Thai food at a reasonable price (under $10 each dish) and huge portion, you'll be full!",

    "text": "I don't know why I haven't written a review for here yet. I mean...it's not like I eat here at least twice a month or anything.... I tried this place when my sister coincidentally stumbled upon it a few years ago when it first opened and have been coming back ever since. I love the atmosphere, it's not your typical Thai place. The interior is very rustic and almost industry with dark woods and open steel. It's definitely a crowd gathering kind of place with light background music and people chattering away all around. The entrance can get a little crowded if there is a long wait because theres no 'real' waiting area, just the chairs and whatever room there is in front of the counter. They definitely go for a simple approach to their menu and their business operations.They're called Noodlehead - don't expect a variety of rice dishes, or any at all actually.  STREET NOODLE #1 -- My go to, always. It doesn't matter when I come here but I always seem to order this even when I come in with the intention of 'trying something new'. I think I have a slight obsession with the fried chicken and they give you a pretty generous amount. The noodles are thin rice noodles, the ones they typically use for pad thai, fried chicken, bok choy, and a sauce that's got a nice kick to it. If your a fan of spicy I would recommend this one. I usually get it at a three, which they consider to be medium, and I always end up with a bit of the food sweats cause of hotness factor. Not complaining about it  CHIANG MAI CURRY NOODLE -- So one of my friends got this dish and I'm a huge sucker for curry and noodles - low and behold this is the best of both worlds (please ignore the Hannah Montana reference). It's a thicker noodle, it's an egg noodle rather than a rice noodle so it is less prone to getting all fat and soggy when you let it sit for an extended period of time. Make it's a little easier to take to go or take home if you need a doggy bag. The flavor is great - it's not too sweet and has got a nice spice factor. They also serve with a birds nest of something fried for added texture. I would like to see some kind of veggies in it, but I enjoy it as is. Pro tip if you've got a little inner fatty like me, if you happen to not finish your dish and take it hope - throw in some rice to the excess sauce. It's the bomb, it makes me drool.   PORK BELLY STEAM BUNS -- Best rendition of pork belly buns I've had at a Pittsburgh restaurant yet. Whenever I come here I always make it a point to order them. The meat is always tender and shredded to really nice thin pieces so when you bit into the bun you're not struggling to rip through with your teeth like a rabid animal. The bun isn't too thick or doughy, which in my opinion is one of the leading issues with most pork bun attempts. It's also got a nice sweetness to it, which the second issue with most pork bun attempts is that there is zero flavor to the bun. Noodlehead doesn't seem to have this issue. They garnish with cilantro and a nice pickled cucumber, I'm assuming its pickled in a rice vinegar. I personally think they should try carrots and daikon as an alternative, but the cucumbers are still delicious as they are. I would recommend these bad boys (2 to an order) as a appetizer.   The waitstaff has always been really good. They're always crowded so they tried to do quick turn overs, but I don't think I've ever been rushed. This place is BYOB also and they're always really good about asking you if you need them to cork your bottles and bring you separate glasses. I will say though that their hostesses are less than stellar. There have been a few occasions I've come in and they were really short with their words, borderline just plain rude. But one or two shall not bring down the whole establishment...  I've tried a lot of the dishes here, most of the appetizer and a number of their entrees. My overall opinion is that Noodlehead is a winner. It won a spot on Pittsburgh's top new restaurants because it's delicious. It's pretty good food for a really good price, less than $10 a dish. They haven't done me wrong yet - I'm a regular and will continue to be one. Key things to take note: BYOB, cash only (ATM inside), no telephone (walk in to order take out), no reservation!",

The last couple times we noticed the spice level was all over the place. In the past if you ordered a three you could guarantee it'd be hot. The last time I went there was hardly any spice. Given that the spice level is one of the main ways you customize your dish it lessens the quality of the meal and experience. We discussed this with friends and they too noticed that the spice levels seems to be inconsistent now. Because I ordered a three and got a 0-1 I sent the meal back. It came out remade at the correct spice level. However, the dish appeared MUCH more watery than usual and there was an eyelash on one of the shrimp!!! I chose to pick that shrimp out and eat the meal because I was really hungry. Over the course of a couple months I went from recommending noodlehead to everyone, to never wanting to eat there again.",

My husband says the pork buns are really REALLY great.  Reasons they did not get 5 stars: 1. Cash only. 2. The quirky stools they use look trendy but are extremely uncomfortable to actually sit and dine at. When I'm out to eat I want to be able to lay back and relax but you can't because the chairs don't HAVE backs. 3. The whole \"We're too cool to have a phone\" thing makes me roll my eyes.  But the food is really so good I'll suffer through those minor inconveniences.   PS If you want takeout you have to order at the counter and wait. They don't have a phone. Which is just weird.",

Menu is small and simple but don't let that fool you , every single dish is packed with so much flavor using the finest, freshest ingredients. Explore all the menu items because each one is impressive-they do not blend together, they are all unique and offer authentic Thai street food at its finest. I have never had a bad meal or bad experience here. The staff is welcoming and service is EXTREMELY quick, you could be out of there in under 30 minutes. Keep in mind they do not have a phone number so no reservations and for takeout you must go to the restaurant to place your order (but like mentioned above, they are extremely quick). I love bringing out-of-town visitors here because I know it's always going to be an enjoyable dining experience with mouthwatering food. BYOB & cash only (ATM located inside the restaurant) make it all the better.",

Proteins are the first issue at N'Head: dry and salty chicken, old and gamey steak, simple pork.. the shrimp's the best protein they serve. The second issue is spice scale: 3 is barely spicy for me and 4 was only sinus clearing.. the descriptions are way off. 4 = \"Asian hot\" at Noodlehead but it'd be a palate cleanser at DC's Little Serow. No pain = no gain  The small menu of main dishes offers fresh Pad Thai that's complex, crunchy, and overall excellent, among the best I've tried. A unique lemon wedge adds oft-absent acid. The Kew Mew is a sugary take on drunken noodles but the bok choy fails to provide enough bitterness. It lacks acid and the large basil clumps fail to balance the sweetness save for the one bite where they dominate your fork.  Apps are similarly limited. The singular sticky buns are heavy on fish sauce and cilantro, and the beef is simple compared to DC's complex Toki Underground chicken version. The grilled beef app is overcooked strips slathered in cilantro and fish sauce, appropriately spicy but one note.  Would return for the pad Thai. Would eat the buns again. Wouldn't make the trip home for it. American Thai is not Thai.",

Personally, I like the ingredients. I can say that it's like eating in Thailand. It came with all ingredients which Sukhothai noodles should have, like what it is in Thailand. However, the taste was somewhat too light. It should be more sour, sweet and a little bit salty. For spicy level, 3 could be enough for some of Thai people like me.   I would be back again for sure, because they have the real Thai noodles. It is kind of difficult to find the real Thai noodles like this in Pittsburgh. I'm still thinking of Thai fried chicken. Certainly, I won't be there on Friday night again.",

I got the Chiang Mai curry noodle and shared an appetizer of pulled pork belly steam bun with a friend.   First the bun. It first seemed a little over-priced for 2 buns that aren't even medium sized. But after I tried it the mutual complaint vanished. IT WAS PERFECT. I would describe it as \"every single bite is a new experience\". The crispiness of cucumber, soft texture of the pork and the exactly perfect thickness of bun. Also it was a little juicy! This dish was just artistic.   The noodle was pretty good, but the buns definitely pulled up my standards. Taste of the curry was refreshing, but not so special. Quality of noodles was good. Very good portion.   Nice environment. As long as it's not the first date (I never believe spicy/hot noodle is appropriate for the first date as it can get a little messy), definitely great place for dating.",

We ordered the Kee Maw and Chiang Mai Noodles, both on spice level 4. Delicious! The Kee Maw particularly, since it was a wok fried noodle, had a wonderful 'wok hei' (wok charred) taste.   Some notes - their menu is very simple, don't expect to have the usual bombardment of choices you get at other 'Asian' restaurants in the U.S. Their sauces are generally a lot sweeter than those you would find in SEA, but not overwhelming and still very delicious! Spice level 4 was nothing for us - definitely try 5 if you're used to eating spicy Asian food.   Also had the fresh veggie rolls and home made lemongrass tea, which was lightly sweetened, fresh and delicious!   Also, we sat outside and received excellent, quick, fuss free service. Extremely happy with this place - will be back to try more!",

As huge fans of Lu Lu's Noodles, we wanted to find another option for great cheap Asian noodles.   After 15 minutes of yelp searching, immediately taken by their website and the simplicity we decided to venture out to Shadyside to check the place out. We went a little early, around 5 and seated ourselves. The place reminded me of a nice little place on the Lower East Side of NYC.  We started with the Pork Buns which were delicious, especially with a little of the chili sauce. My girlfriend got the Pad See Eew which was one of the best we'd ever had and I got the Chiang Mai Curry, which was sweet and spicy and plenty filling.   Everything was under $10 and delicious. The only downside was some of the seating and low tables were a bit awkward, but the food is worth it. Its also a BYOB restaurant which is awesome, but we just had water. Great food for 2, for under $30.",

Regarding the menu, while not extensive, it has the essentials.  Being the Pad Thai fan that I am, I ordered up some Tofu Pad Thai and was impressed when it came out: hot, fresh and spiced to my requested level.  What makes this place unique in my eyes, however, are all the great beverage options on the menu!  Mexican coke?  Yep, so good.  Overall, a great meal that did not leave a dent in the wallet.

We ordered pork belly steamed buns, Thai fried chicken, Pad Thai,and Chiang Mai Curry-- all were amazing!  Know before you go: there is community seating (I'm sure the group next to us hated our conversation), it's BYOB (didn't even notice the fee, it was so nominal) and it's CASH-only (there's an ATM across the streets so ain't no thang).

Having our own bottle of water was great for the spicy dishes!  We brought a bottle of wine; it's BYOB and corkage is only $0.50 per person! Awesome. The menu is small, but they had 3 vegetarian options for noodles and I opted for the tofu pad thai.  I went for no spice, and the fiancee got it at spice level 3.  His biggest compliment about the food was that with this dish, unlike many other pad thais around Pittsburgh, the spice level you order actually corresponds to what you expect! Finally!  I thought the dish was a good size for the price.  The tofu was cooked perfectly and there was plenty of it.  I really wish they had a vegetarian appetizer, and I also with they did take-out.

It actually tastes pretty authentic compared to others in the area and is spiced well. Reminds me alt of some of the street style Thai places in LA. Every noodle dish I've had had been very good. If you choose hot they actually make it hot. The pork buns are really tasty. Has a cool vibe and its byob!",

There is no phone to call in for takeout so you have to go there and wait about 15-20 minutes for your food. I took my mom there in the winter and they sat us near the front door. Every time someone opened the door, it was freezing cold and it ruined the experience. Other than those reasons, I would have given it a perfect rating. Also, I LOVE that it is BYOB and has a low recycling fee.  The See Yew and Sukothai are great choices.",

All of which are fantastic.    4 things to note about Noodlehead:   1.  BYOB - bring a bottle of wine, a growler, something yummy to share for those over 21.  2.  Cash only!  However they have an ATM available in the restaurant to get cash - nice and easy!  3.  First come first serve with seating - they do not take reservations. 4.  Parking on Highland can be iffy.  Don't park in the whole foods parking lot.  I haven't experienced it - but they WILL tow your car.  I always say it's a \"sign\" that I am supposed to get Noodlehead take out when I drive past on my way home from work and there is a parking space open.  (Score for me!)  Back to the food - Pork Belly Steam buns - get them.  Devour them.  Love them.  Get to noodlehead.  The staff is great, the food is amazing, and the atmosphere is superb.",

I ordered the Street Noodle #2 with no spice. I tried a friend's dish with spice level 1 and it was a drastic difference. I cannot imagine how spice level 5 would be. Tread carefully here. The dish came with a good portion of shrimp tempura and noodles. It was delicious.  The pork buns were very good as well. No as fatty as I'd like but there'a good chunk of meat in there.  My biggest gripe was the long wait time for the food to come out. Our food took a good 25-30 minutes. Meanwhile, we saw smaller parties at other tables (that came in much later than we did) get their food quickly. Another party of 3 got their food within 5-10 minutes of sitting. Even our server was apologetic -- no reason was given as to why it took so long for us. Did they forget our order?  Anyway, other than how long the food took to the come out, note that this place only takes cash.  Coming from NYC, the best part of this place is the prices. At $9 a dish, it feels like a steal.",

No person over lk...40 seemed to be there    And food was great! Usually whenever I order shrimp anything in an asian restaurant, they don't give me but here they did not hold back! I got #2 with shrimp tempura. The batter was light and crunchy. The shrimps were fat. And good shrimp-to-noodle ratio. Got the spice level to be a 2, and it had a decent sparks of spice even for an asian who likes spicy food. But next time I'd go for 3 or 4.   One caveat is that it's cash only.",

Especially street thai food or the dingy little holes in the wall in Bangkok or Phuket that exude flavor. I have had plenty of it in Thailand. I've had my good friend's mom's home made Thai Food (they're Thai). Thai food is extraordinary. It's a staple to me. So I knows a lil bit.  But Noodlehead is what it is. It's a cute little Thai place serving up quick street noodle dishes if you have cash only or a debit card (which can be used to obtain cash to which you can pay for your meal).  Thai dishes that truly are tasty. Would I say Noodlehead is my favorite, no. Would I eat there again, sure because it's a fun place that will appease everyone's palate.  Is it consistent ...eh, not really. I think the busier they get, things can be a little lackluster, including flavor. I prefer going there during the daytime for lunch or prior to busy nights because that's when flavors really lack. I love coconut and I love thai basil, and when I get a poor blend of the two on more than one nights, I'm calling you out on it!. This is why I gave it 3 and not 4.    But Noodlehead is too important of a place (not just to me) but also to Shadyside, for me to proceed and pick it apart systematically. That's not the kind of place this is.   It is to thai food what Mad Mex, In my opinion, is to Mexican food. Fun atmosphere, decent food, and hits the spot.   Not bad. I'll come here again over and over.",

From time to time I get the Street noodle #2 but I'm pretty consistent in what I order. Today I went with the Street Noodle #2 and was disappointed by the freshness and by the service. The last time I came it was strictly the service that was poor and the hostess was very rude and so I left but because I've been coming since it's inception, I wasn't going to let that experience deter me. This experience has and I don't foresee myself returning to Noodlehead anytime soon if ever.   My food wasn't hot, the flavor seemed a bit bland and my shrimp were very greasy as if they had been sitting. I ate it because I was hungry and in need of nourishment. The shrimp were not as plentiful as before so I ordered a second serving of the tempura shrimp. They came and they didn't even attempt to heat them up. They were lukewarm at best and grease oozing out when you press on them. I got the waitresses attention and I asked the waitress for two things: for a fresh and hot order of tempura shrimp. Without a word, no apology, just silence, she grabbed the plate and walked away. Came back a few minutes later, placed them on the table and asked was this better? In my head I'm thinking I don't know I haven't tasted them but I replied yes and said thank you and she walked away. Her demeanor was one that seem irritated and put on for having to do her job. I ate two shrimp my mother ate two shrimp and we took the rest to go. Left her a tip and said goodbye.   I understand that it was slow but that's no excuse for poor service and cold food.",

But the rest of the times their dishes were amazing! Be prepared with cash, if not there's an atm located inside.

    "text": "Like many other Yelpers have noted, the pork belly steamed buns at Noodlehead are a hit. It's worth getting (at least) one order per person because they are kind of small, but more so because they are sooo tasty you will not want to share.   The menu is limited, but includes all the favorites and is very reasonably priced. Portion sizes are bigger than I was expecting. I went with my trusty Pad Thai. I ordered it medium spicy (which I think was only a 2/5!) and it was super hot. I like spicy food so I was able to handle it, but even spice lovers should order their dish a notch or two down from what they'd usually order.   We didn't do BYOB this time but I think there is a small fee for it. Also, it's cash only but they now have an ATM inside the restaurant.   The dining space is BEAUTIFUL! It's kind of dark inside, lots of dark wood on the walls... it has a very cool feel.   P.S. When the menu says big flat noodles, they mean BIG FLAT noodles! Those babies were easily an inch and a half wide and thicker than a lasagna noodle. And they had a weird jelly-like texture I just wasn't ready for.",

There were a lot of tables which gave me the impression that it was excellent in food as well.   For appetizers we ordered the pork buns and the pig wings. Both were delicious. There aren't many places in pittsburgh that serve pork buns so this was a wonderful find. The buns weren't too soggy or too fluffy but the perfect size. The pig wings are actually like a chicken wing but made with pork and marinated with flavoring- also very delicious.   Disappointed- For the main dish I ordered the street #1 because a lot of yelp users have left good comments and mouth watering pictures. But to my disappointment it was WAY too salty. It was difficult to finish the dish at all. The dish comes with deep fried chicken that gets soggy pretty quickly from the sauce. I gave this place 3 stars for their modern decor and their appetizers. If I come back and try another noodle dish I may change my ratings. One thing I do want to try next time is their BYOB.",

It looks like it was made for the nightlife scene, which made it weird that they don't have a bar or even bottles, but it is BYOB.  The parking is street only, which may be tough in that location, but we didn't have too much trouble finding some free spots in nearby neighborhood streets.  The food was great. We started off with the pork belly bao appetizer. These were delicious. They were a little small, and the dough was a little too chewy, but besides that, it was the baomb. I had the Chiang Mai curry, which reminds me a lot of a Thai dish called \"Khao Soi\" (or are they one in the same?). Basically it's a chicken curry stew with noodles, but also topped with crispy noodles for texture. This was REALLY FREAKING GOOD, and pretty filling as well. The S/O had the Street Noodle 2, which is tempura shrimp over thin egg noodles in a sweet/sour/spicy sauce. She liked my dish more, but I thought hers was delicious... only it was a much smaller portion than mine.  The spice levels are from 1-4 or 5 I think. I went with 2 for Medium, and I thought it was just right for that little kick but not too much to take away from the flavor.",

This is the place I take out of towners when I want to give them a taste of modern Pittsburgh (people think that Primanti's is synonymous with Pittsburgh cuisine).   First, the food. When going to noodlehead there are things that you must do: you must start your meal with the steamed buns; if you don't you're only hurting yourself. These are more than just appetizers, they're flavor adventures. The first time I took my father here, he ate three orders of them. On the outside they're warm and soft cheese Asian buns (that sounds kind of dirty), tasty tender pork on the inside, and topped with crunchy cilantro and pickles. If you haven't yet found God, you might find him in the steam buns; these classify as a religious experience. As for the rest of the menu he really can't go wrong so far away.   The atmosphere is modern and cozy, but remember they don't take credit cards, they don't have a phone, and they don't take reservations. Probably because they don't need to do any of those things and they know it.",

They're almost always packed, but if you don't have a larger party of 5 or 6 you will be seated very quickly. You can also BYOB.   My favorite dish is the See Yew with chicken. It's delicious! I've found myself craving it now and then and I have to go back for more. Their prices for their main dishes are also pretty reasonable. Most noodle plates are $9, and it's a big helping. The food also comes out super quickly. The longest I've had to wait was probably 10 minutes for my food.  The only issue I have is with their appetizers. I wish they weren't as expensive or gave you more for your money. Under \"snacks\" we ordered the spring rolls for $4. Only 2 came and they weren't any bigger than my thumb. We haven't ordered any else since.  Quick tips: bring cash they don't except cards! They also don't have a phone!",

The pork bun appetizer is reminds you of the ones at Ippudo, except the pork is pulled. The bun is pillowy soft, and is worth the $3 splurge on these melt-in-your-mouth bites. The wings were pretty tasty as well- three pieces in one order.   We also tried the See Yew Noodles with Chicken and the Chiang Mai Curry. I'm used to eating rice with my curry, but having chewy, wavy noodles with the curry was awesome. I actually wanted to order more noodles for the leftover curry sauce. The See Yew Noodles were really flavorful as well, the I loved the chewy texture of the flat noodles. The cold pickled cucumber garnish was a perfect complement to the spicy dishes.  The best part? The dishes were under $10! This makes Cash-Only acceptable. Can't wait to try the other dishes!",

(If it's your first time, order the pork belly steam buns and one of the street noodles, see yew, or the curry. so, so good).   The cons:  - dinner service. They seem to get overwhelmed very easily. I can't really tell if there's any rhyme or reason to who waits on you or when. They don't seem to have sections. A couple waiters who don't know what's going on and a couple food runners who are working their butts off. You spend way too much time waiting for your bill when you'd think it'd be in their best interest to turn tables. This doesn't seem to be a problem at lunch, only dinner. - not a lot of parking around there. but that's no surprise in Shadyside.  - I don't care that they're cash only, but it does seem to concern some people so worth mentioning - No phone number (or at least I haven't found one), so I can't order carry out in advance, which drives me nuts because I would do so probably twice a week.  - sometimes the spice level is inconsistent visit to visit. I like moderately spice, so I usually order a 2, but sometimes I can hardly taste the spice and other times I'm dying. Not a big deal because the food is tasty either way.",

    "text": "Noodlehead has surprisingly well planned ambiance; I really love the layout and the sort-of (fancy) barn accents. The tables are well placed and spaced. I also appreciate their simple, no nonsense menu. But with so few vegetarian options, I am not likely to dine here over, say, Thai Cuisine. The dishes I've tried have been fine, but it'd be nice to be able to order an appetizer to go with my meal. They also have no trouble turning up the spice here, beware! My partner could hardly eat his spice level \"3\" dish that seemed to be ruined for him with overdone heat. I think they just add chili sauce or paste to increase the heat, not fresh peppers or anything delicious like that. So it's probably best to aim low with your requested level, then ask for chili sauce to add yourself.",

    "text": "It was all right, nothing so fantastic.  Ordered the steamed pork dumpling appetizer.  Unfortunately, they were kind of blandish and not very seasoned, relying instead on the salty sweet sauce to pour over.  I left 2 of the 4 on the plate.  Also got the beef pho, which included bok choy and bean sprouts.  Okay, maybe I am not used to the proportions, but there were SO many chunks of beef, had to take it home, could not finish this meat-heavy portion.  The rice noodles were the thinnest I've encountered.  There was very little actual veggie in the soup, which I would have liked.  Felt like the proportions were out of what meat to veg, but this is a meat-heavy town.  The broth was heavy and had a hint of sweet.  At first blush, was tasty, then realized the flat complexity of flavors.  Anyway, a great place for those on a budget, busy busy place.  Overall, I was a bit disappointed, maybe ordered the wrong stuff.",

It truly is some of the best Thai food in \"da burgh.\" The see yew with chicken was absolutely delicious! It had the perfect amount of savoriness and spiciness; really a wonderful combination of flavors. Not to mention that everything on the menu is $9 or less! So, if tasty, inexpensive Thai food is what you're craving, I say jump in on the hype!",

All delicious and plenty of food to share between myself and my fiance.  Their spice scale is 1-5 as opposed to 1-10 so be careful :)  I just wish they had a phone number so I could call a takeout order and as others have said it's cash only.",

    "text": "I was super sad when my neighborhood Thai spot, Kanok, closed its doors. I hadn't been able to get over to Noodlehead after moving, but now that I have...I'm actually mad that such an amazing place opened after I left Highland!  I went with a group and tried a good number of dishes. The menu is small, but it allows them to execute everything to perfection. It was obvious that their noodles were homemade. If they're not, then I want to know where they are getting noodles of this caliber of freshness from, because they're amazing. All my friends' $9 dishes were tasty with large portions--the Pad Thai, See Ew, Chang Mai Curry, and Street Noodle #2. Basically, you can't go wrong with anything here.  I went with one of the $6 \"snack\" noodles, the Sukothai, and it was easily my favorite. I find most soups to be boring, but their spicy lime broth was rich with deep flavors. Spice level 4 seemed tame at first, but as I ate more of the soup it developed a slow burn that got my nose running. Along with the noodles, it was packed with deliciously seasoned ground pork, chopped green beans, bean sprouts, and a hardboiled egg. The pork belly steamed buns are also a must have. One bun and a \"snack\" noodle filled me up, though I wasn't starving since I had a chai next door at Oh Yeah while we waited to get in here.  There were some not-so-good things: 1. We were quoted a 20-30 minute wait, and ended up having to wait a little over an hour for a table. 2. Our waitress was kind of snobby and totally unhelpful. I asked which of two dishes she preferred and she wouldn't give me a suggestion because \"they're not similar at all\" (well duh, I read the ingredients). She also gave us a weird lecture about pork belly as if we didn't know what it was or something. It was really busy though, so I'll give her bitchiness the benefit of the doubt... 3. Cash only doesn't vibe with the trendy atmosphere here at all. 4. No desserts, also kind of strange. Even just one dessert and one sorbet would be good.  The not-so-good things were pretty minor though and outweighed by the outstanding food, and the fact that I'm already craving more Sukothai noodle soup two days after eating here...I can't give it any less than a perfect score!",

Also there're no crispy dumpling-four on top of my dish. however, I'll come here again. If it didn't get better, I'll have to say goodbye.",

Most of their food is really delicious, but I knocked off a star for their gross tofu and iffy service. I used to get See Ew with tofu as my go-to dish, but the past several times the tofu has been very over-fried, making it nothing but a chewy outer shell of tofu. Fried tofu should be a bit chewy or crispy on the outside with an inside of be actual tofu, not empty, pulverized, over-fried air. this almost lost them my business, but fortunately I do eat meat so I tried the See Ew with chicken, and it was great! My new go-to dish.",

    "text": "Noodlehead is tied for my favorite Thai in Pittsburgh along with Smiling Banana Leaf in Highland Park and Nicky's Thai Kitchen downtown. Though they have a short menu, they offer interesting and tasty dishes and I have never come with companions who did not thoroughly enjoy what they ordered. The one major drawback to this place is their \"hipster\" practices of not having a telephone and only taking cash. There is an ATM in the back of the restaurant in case you forgot cash but the wait can be very long and if you want takeout, you have to go to the restaurant to order and then sit and wait for it. This is one of only a few places I know of in Pittsburgh that is BYOB and it is the most reasonable one I have ever seen, with a 50 cents recycling fee per person (regardless of how much and what type of drinks you have). The service is not always the best because it is usually very crowded and the waiters and waitresses are running all over the place, but the food comes out quickly and is absolutely delicious. I wouldn't recommend the fresh rolls, which aren't very flavorful, but I love the pad kee mao and the green curry linguine. Note that the Noodlehead spice scale ranges from 1 to 5, so read their descriptions for each number rather than going with your usual spiciness number from a 1 to 10 scale. The prices are wonderfully reasonable and with the food as good as it is, some of my co-workers and I have a standing dinner at Noodlehead weekly! Highly recommend!!!",
