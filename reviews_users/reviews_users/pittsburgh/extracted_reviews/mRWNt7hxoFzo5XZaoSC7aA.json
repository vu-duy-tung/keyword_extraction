My girlfriend and I frequently come in for Brunch on Sunday and they are very reasonably priced and it's not usually too crowded. We also go in fairly often to drink on the weekends. It gets really crowded on Fridays for Karaoke but its usually a nice crowd for Saturday. They have good food at a great price and everything is baked. We also love to go for dinner during the week when it is nice out and sit outside and people watch on Walnut. The employees are very friendly and laid back. It's a great place for a Shadyside resident go to bar. It's certainly mine!",

I still haven't been for the nightlife, but we ended up here for breakfast because there was literally nothing else open on the morning of July 4th.   I was open to the idea of eating here, but the breakfast was pretty disappointing. My friend's chocolate chip pancakes were small in diameter, undercooked and only had a few chips per pancake. My breakfast burrito didn't have the cheese I asked for and was pretty average. I needed a lot of ketchup because they really didn't try to put much salsa in it. My friends bacon was tiny (I mean, 1 inch long, 1/4 inch wide) and far too salty. Anyway, I wish I wasn't so hungry or I wouldn't have gone here in the first place. Would've loved to spend the 10 bucks or so on somewhere else :-/",

My husband and I went one night in August (full disclosure: we had been working on our house all day, so we were starving and disoriented by the heat, and I was about 9 weeks pregnant and experiencing a persistent low-grade nausea all day). On this particular moment in my pregnancy I was violently craving a Caesar salad. I scoured the internet for places on Walnut and Ellsworth that *might* offer a decent Caesar, couldn't really determine which would be best, and we finally decided on Cappy's.   Honestly? This was the worst - I mean aboslute worst! - excuse for a Caesar salad that I have ever encountered. It was made with iceberg lettuce (!?) and the dressing was more like a bottled light Italian than a creamy Caesar. It was terrible! My husband got a Rachel sandwich - the turkey version of a reuben - and he also said it was mediocre. I think this would be a fun place to go back to to have a couple of beers while sitting outside. But in the future I will stay away from the food. I don't think I would even try an appetizer next time.",

I never was too impressed with the food, but I never came here for the food. In fact, if you want good food within walking distance, go to some place like Harris Grill.

We were visiting Pittsburgh from California, and popped in on our way back to the hotel. Owner Brian Carey mans the bar and keeps the casual atmosphere going with lighthearted banter. Stick around long enough and you will meet staff and owners from other local waterholes, or maybe even your local councilman. It's a great little place w/irish pub ambiance. Make sure to pop your head in for a drink or two on a Thursday night - you never know who might show up - like the Bud guy or the Jagermeister girls - it's a busy place, and a lot of fun, w/great staff and an owner who cares - this is as close to CHEERS as you'll ever get",

The only reason I'm giving this bar 2 instead of 1 star is because the karaoke on Fridays (if you can handle the people and the crowd) is pretty good- although there are half a dozen better places to karaoke in Pittsburgh.

I live in Shadyside and every time I've gone out I would say that I've ended up at Cappys at some point maybe 30% of the time.  That's not too bad seeming how 54% of all stats are made up on the spot.   What set's Cappys apart from the other local bars is...it's so small.  It's so small that I feel like I should know everyone there.  That is also a play on the atmosphere.  I feel like most people do know most people there.  Actually, I may go back there tonight after writing this review!   I'd like to reiterate the point of this review.  It's a bar, it has alcohol.  It has food.  To me, it's the atmosphere that really sells Cappys.  It may very well appeal to you and is worth a shot.",

Although I've definitely experience better dining atmospheres, if you get a chance to sit in their small outdoor seating it's worth it.  It has a bit of that \"Cheers\" kind of charm but to me is a bit small.  The inside is dark and if you go in the winter time gets very crowded.  I would advise trying out Cappy's in the early fall or summer months.  Sitting outside on Walnust St. is probably one of my favorite things to do.  If you are with friends push some tables together and get to people watching.  If you are alone, no worries.  Read a book or the paper, or simply relax.  The people eating here are usually a bit older.  Sometimes they will have their kids with them during lunch time.  Most college kids frequent the sub shops, coffee places, and larger bars on Walnut.  The staff is always very nice and fairly prompt.   Food: The food is pretty good.  I have eaten several of their salads and have always enjoyed them.  They are quite large so get ready to take a to-go box home or share some of yours with a friend.  The sandwiches are great in my opinion.  I've never tried one that I didn't enjoy.  My sister is a vegetarian, so if this is your case don't worry, there are lots of options for those who don't enjoy a big burger or chicken sandwich.    Prices: The prices are fairly cheap for being in Squirrell Hill.  I would advise anyone to eat there because I don't think the prices are out of the park at all.  Very affordable and the portions are quite large so it is well worth your dollars spent. :)",

    "text": "Cappy's is a dive in the middle of a very nice area.  For that feat alone, I give it 3 stars.  The bonus star is for cheap drinks and decent food and having outside tables.  There are only a handful of beers on tap ranging from the Pittsburgh regulars to a 2-3 seasonals.  While there's a good mix of high-low liquors, there are no specialty cocktails.  Yes, you can order a boilermaker but no pomegranate crantinis here.  Respect.  The sandwiches/wraps are totally decent--meaning better than fast food but not gourmet.  You get a good amount of food for ~$8 and it's tasty.  The best part about Cappy's is that it offers a reprieve from the jam-packed bro bars on Walnut St.  Yes, Cappy's gets crowded on karaoke night, but generally there is room to breathe inside and there are a half dozen outdoors tables that are perfect for laughing at the drunks stumbling home.  P.S. The pictures above are in not of the Cappy's on Walnut St.  I'm not sure why they are posted here.",

    "text": "To me, Cappy's Cafe is a nice, reliable, middle-of-the-road place to go for a good burger and a couple of beers on a summer evening.  It is just your average bar (another reviewer described it as \"the bar back home,\" and yes, exactly, it is,) and I love it for that.    Cappy's is nice and unpretentious, which is something that sets it apart from a lot of the rest of Walnut Street.  Not far down the street, you can get a tiny morsel of ice cream for a stroke-inducing four dollars, but at Cappy's, you can spend a reasonable price on a reasonable meal.    So far, food-wise, I've tried the Alamo sandwich (I think that's what it's called,) and the bacon-and-bleu-cheese burger (Big Bleu?)  Both of them were definitely satisfying, and the Alamo, with its fried chicken strips and barbecue sauce, was at the very least pretty good, even if it took a few years off the end of my life.  Getting outdoor seating is key, though.  They air-condition the bejeezus out of the inside area, and one time we accidentally showed up on karaoke night, which made us REALLY glad we found a table outside.  Karaoke night is great when you're expecting it, but when you're not, there are few fates worse.  Service is usually kind of slow as well, but the wait staff is nice.  One waitress we had was a little thick, though, when it came to splitting our checks.  Nobody paid what they actually owed that night, but we didn't want to fight it out with her.  All in all, Cappy's is a nice, unpretentious little place to grab some food.  I'll definitely go back.",

The food isn't great, but it isn't bad either, and the prices for food and drink won't break the bank.  The menu also boasts quite a few options, and anyone looking for standard bar fare in this increasingly ritzy area may find a haven at Cappy's.  I'd never call this place delicious or wonderful, but I certainly wouldn't want it closing up shop either.",

While most of Walnut street is pretty corporate, Cappy's is still there and still local with a nice group of regulars.  I am writing this review today because I love LOVE love the hot pretzel sticks - not on the menu but I was still able to order them.  Other reasons to love Cappy's: -outside seating in the summer -affordable, tasty food - they don't fry the french fries and they are still really great -Fridays are usually Cappy-oke Night and the place is packed (IheartPGH is not a kaeroke fan but she appreciates that others are)  Rumor has it that a few east end singles have met their future spouses at Cappy's.  I even like that the ads in the bathroom stalls have not been updated in something like 3 years.  And I really like the Pittsburgh and Shadyside cross stitched samplers that hang on the walls, I know it sounds strange, but it just fits in this place.",

It's nice in that the service is usually pretty good and that it can be a lot of fun when it's busy and you got there early enough to find a seat.  When you stop by late in the night though...claiming a spot or getting a drink can be difficult.  Cappy's has a lot of fun events going on.  I particularly like their Karaoke night on Friday nights and their trivia night on Tuesday nights.  The drinks are reasonable and about average for the area to slightly below average if you get one of the specials.  They have 3-4 outdoor tables on the sidewalk on walnut which makes for a nice place to sit and people watch when it's nice out.  The food is pretty good as far as bar food goes, including the brunch.  I appreciate that they make do without frying food.  Overall the place is fun, has a fairly diverse crowd, and worth checking out.",

As others have noted, it's a dive bar that happens to serve pretty decent food; my wife thinks that the Big Mountain sandwich is to die for (and I'd agree).  The service has always been friendly, and it never seems to get as loud in here as it gets in some other places (Shady Grove, I'm looking at you).  I know it might sound strange, but one of the things that I appreciate the most about Cappy's is that it treats its waitresses as waitresses, not as sex symbols.  I've always found the skimpy outfits that waitresses choose to wear (or are made to wear) at some other places to be rather insulting -- these women are there to do their job, not to be ogled at by everyone in the area.  So thumbs up, Cappy's, for treating your female employees with some respect!  My wife and I moved away from the Shadyside area a few months ago.  Cappy's is the one thing we miss.  Big Mountain forever!",

The crowd was mostly around college age, and the singers picked fun songs so it was definitely entertaining. No terrible singers. The host was nice and energetic, but he was lacking a lot of newer songs in his catalog, and he definitely plays favorites with regulars and people who throw a few bucks into his tip jar. There was over an hour wait to sing, and yet there were a handful of people who went up to sing 3 or more times while we were there. A good host will make sure new entries get in before people who have gone already get to come up again (and again...and again).",

Perhaps the wait wasn't meant to be an hour but our waitress definitely FORGOT OUR ORDER and we sat there wondering what could be so tricky about some eggs and toast.    ...one hour and one complaint later...  The food arrives.  Hot sauce was more difficult, took two requests before it came.  Of course I arrived last and ordered 30 min after everyone else but my food came first.  The food is basic and inexpensive, you get what you pay for.

Our breakfast was tasty tasty tasty. Sure, nothing seemed fresh (or not out of a can, etc.), but it hit the spot. Nice and greasy and filling. We supplemented our meal with some mimosas, which were quite tasty, but those are hard to screw up. Our waitress was attentive and seemed rather nice. We sat by the windows, which is my second favorite spot in a restaurant/bar after the actual bar. I'd go back as I have now found a cheap alternative to the pricey (and sometimes pretentious ...)

With fresh food it's ok to wait, especially when you're in good company. Here was our issue: there are two servers who are polite, but seemed very inexperienced. It was obvious one forgot to put our order in but instead of confronting us about it, they ignored our table for the rest of our visit. We had to order / get drinks / get checks through the food runner after that. I'm not sure if she was embarrassed or poorly trained but we ended up waiting close to 2 hours for our food and in the end needed to get it to go because both of us were going to be late to work. The food was delicious and I hope this was just a hiccup in the normal customer service for this cafe.",

They didn't check on us after a few minutes of getting our food, so we sat there with problems and lack of desired condiments such as ketchup and salsa. We never got the salsa. Neither of them addressed the entirely burnt pancake I received. We had our card our to signal that we were ready for our check, which she gave us (after we asked for it due to being tired of waiting) but she neglected to pick up the card we already had placed out for her. They had groups waiting and this clearly slowed down their turnover rate. The omelet had still raw peppers inside it and was clearly just one egg, so it easily fell apart. I guess you can't expect much from a place like this.",

Not usually a big fan of green peppers, but these were done right and gave it a nice crunch. Comes with toast and those assortment of little Smuckers jelly packets. And the Steelers pregame show was on all the TVs. Would fill up here for breakfast again.",

Reminds me of Nadines which is my neighborly cheers bar.   We ordered mimosas to drink. They were great and strong. Many brunch places have a weak mimosa. Two gave me a buzz. I've drank an entire mimosa carafe at some places and barely caught a buzz.  I ordered the Shadyside skillet which has your choice of meat, scrambled eggs, green peppers and onions all on top of home fries. It was good. The portion size was small but it was good.  My bf ordered corned beef and hash which came with choice of any style eggs plus toast. Surprisingly the corn beef and hash were separate and not mixed. Again, serving size was small but it was good.  Overall it was a great time. Bob Marley played in the background and it was a relaxing Sunday afternoon.",

This is the only locals bar in Shadyside, and it is filled with an eclectic group of regulars on most days, and on Fridays they draw the college crowd for their infamous Cappyoke. The staff is fantastic and are happy to share a story or a joke with you, while still providing service second to none. Trivia is also a fun attraction on Wednesday, and as the reigning and undefeated champion, I can affirm that it is challenging... for some. My only complaint is Lurch at the door on the weekend, but he's generally harmless if you don't make eye contact. Cappy's will forever be the love of my life, and I look forward to many great years to come.",

They do have a lot of bottles apparently but no bottle list to choose from...so. We got sandwiches and they were decent but the fries (which they charge extra for) tasted freezer burnt.

The drinks were really strong which is always a plus. Their perogies are really good! They had an entire spread for the party but I certainly like the stuffed one with cheese and onion the best.
