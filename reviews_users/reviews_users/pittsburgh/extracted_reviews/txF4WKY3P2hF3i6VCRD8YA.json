Some of the other pizza delivery options have been hit or miss lately so we ventured out and were very pleased with our decision!   I ordered garlic ranch chicken wings and my fiance ordered Angelina's favorite pizza then I got the little one a pizza boat.  The wings were big and meaty drenched in some garlicky ranch sauce served with a side of house made ranch sauce.  I was in ranch heaven!  Angelina's favorite had banana peppers, pepperoni, onions, sausage, and olives.  All of the ingredients were nice and fresh!  I really can't complain about a thing!  The delivery guy was super friendly as well.  I can't wait to taste their hoagies because that's what all of the reviews rave about!  Oh and they have FREE delivery!",

I was desperate for pizza in the way that only a pregnant woman can be and after Slice let me down and Antonio's was just awful, I knew I had to search out something new.  Angelina's had good reviews and was close, so it was worth a shot.   I ordered a large with pineapple and bacon.  Wow.  Real cheese - I think provolone for the bite with a lot of canned pineapple and the piece de resistance - real, crunchy bacon broked into smaller pieces!  No bacon bits here.  It was awesome.  The sauce isn't too sweet or too spicy, the crust is just spongey enough, but not too chewy.  While I do still love me some thin crust, this pizza will do.  I can't wait to order again and try something on their large, large menu.",

Had the hot and would have liked to tried the Wing Dust based on their description.  The pizza crust was a medium thickness with a golden brown edge and bottom.  We had the Cigar Rolls which are filo (sp, their spelling) triangles filled with feta and some parsley that are deep fried.  A little on the greasy side, wish they were baked.  The menu includes Hoagies, Subs, & Grinders.   Found out later that you can actually choose your crust - thick or thin.  Check out the website for some interesting options including hummus or how about a Banana Cream Pizza!  This is take out or delivery only.  Parking is an issue.  Room for about 2 cars in the side lot.  Street parking is not available in front, it is about 100 yards away so get delivery if you can.",

It always takes over an hour when you have them deliver the food, and if you go to pick it up they'll at times tell you they sent it out to be delivered because they didn't pay attention on the slip if it was delivery or take out. I've also ordered before on their website and had my food not delivered at all and when I called the restaurant (multiple times) no one answered the phone. Luckily my card was never charged. I used to order from here at least once every month or two, but I've quit ordering because of the hit or miss issues with them.",

    "text": "I would give this place 4 stars. I really don't know any other pizza place, especially in the South Hills, where you can order online and get hummus and pizza/hoagies at the same time. My boyfriend and I both hate calling people or being on the phone and so we use GrubHub quite frequently. That's where Angelina's loses a star. Their pizza is okay- nothing I would normally go out of my way for- although their spinach and feta is decent, is just alright.  I liked that they had wraps and hummus. I would usually add garlic or basil to the hummus myself, but it aways came with warm pita and olives and was a nice option when ordering from a pizza place. What really disappoints me is the fact that it seems that they are no longer on GrubHub, but are now offering online ordering from their own website. While this is completely understandable (I believe Grubhub/seamless takes a percentage and orders are lost) the Angelina's website is totally frustrating and not user friendly at all. I entered my order at least three times before giving up and ordering somewhere else. I would typically give this place 4 stars for their ordering options and diverse menu, but their new online ordering had not only frustrated me enough to write a review, but to find my convenient pizza places elsewhere entirely. I'm mostly hoping the owners or whoever deals with the online situation st Angelina's will see this and fix their website or address the GrubHub issue.  Just being able to order hummus in the South Hills was a pretty big deal for me. That being said- their pizza is okay, but not really worth going out of your way for. If online ordering isn't a big deal for you, I would definitely do Slice or Badamos.",

    "text": "This is our new favorite pizza spot in Brookline.  You can find us there picking up pizza most Fridays and in the winter we are getting it delivered (usually right on time or early).  The Angelina's supreme pizza is our favorite which comes with peperoni, bacon, sausage, peppers, onions and mushrooms.  The toppings are fresh, the pizza is not to greasy and the dough is tasty!  This past visit we tried one of their sandwiches-they have a pretty extensive menu and many other items including burgers and hoagies.  The buffalo chicken sandwich was huge and pretty tasty. I also ordered a side of breadsticks. I was a bit disappointed with the breadsticks as they were pretty bland and needed something else.  Next time I'll try the cheesy bread.",

    "text": "Ok, I couldn't stay away. Despite the terrible pasta (still terrible) and horrible delivery, I started ordering again. And what do you know! Delivery improved tremendously!  I moved, so I was now in their delivery radius as reported to GrubHub and could order directly from that website. (I still don't know what was going on that I could order on their restaurant website since I was within their service radius, but not grubhub before. Hrm.) I don't know if the website was the issue or they hired different delivery people or use GrubHub for delivery (I think through postmates or the like?) but however it works, it's much better now.  I have now had the pizza and I'm very pleased with it. SO GOOD. I usually order either a cheese pizza w bacon and red peppers or I'll get their Hawaiian pizza. THEY HAVE MANGO ON IT. This is big for me. Pineapple, mango, bacon, and ham (which I subbed out for salami.) The mango adds a lot to the flavor, but I wish the chunks were bigger. That's my only complaint about the pizza. The crust isn't as thin as I would usually prefer, but its still yummy.  The cigar rolls are still perfect (when they have them) and the pasta is still overloaded with way, way too much of whatever sauce it's made with so I'm definitely going to stop ordering that from here. Most recently I ordered the creamy calabrese and couldn't eat more than two bites. It was overloaded with alfredo sauce and topped with a thick layer of cheese. It seems Angelina's approach to pasta is just to overload it with fat, which they've proven can actually be overdone. I threw out the pasta.  But for pizza, burgers, apps? If this much improved delivery continues, I will continue to make this my pizza go-to.",

It can take anywhere from 1-2 hours when they are right down the street. Food comes cold but you are so hungry you just eat it anyway. I don't have many options in my area so I have given them multiple chances to get it right. They brought me an extra bottle of water to be nice, but I would really rather get my food on time for once.   I feel bad writing this review , I'm hoping it helps someone out.  Don't ever order in a rush",

    "text": "Visiting from out of town so we couldn't venture out but decided to try this place out and have it delivered. We ordered 2 servings of the coconut shrimp with fries and a two litre of rootbeer. ABYSMAL!!! The coconut shrimp was burned as if it just returned from hell and it tasted like char. The fries were limp and plain, I understand they have plain fries and seasoned but there wasn't the slightest bit of salt and they tasted and had the texture of being microwaved. Probably because they were placed in a Styrofoam container on top of tissue liner as soon as they were expelled from the depths of hell along with the coconut shrimp and the condensation from the box after the hour and a half delivery wilted them beyond edible consumption. Oh! The cocktail sauce comes in a packet IF you can find it underneath the food and tissue liner. The root beer also resembled a product of hell as it was hot as well. No napkins, no receipt, no good!",

    "text": "In the months since a fire destroyed their previous spot in Dormont (formerly Varrati's), Angelina's has finally been reincarnated after a long delay in a small, no-seating, takeout/delivery-only location on the border between West Liberty Avenue and Brookline Boulevard.  While I still sorely miss Krazy Brothers, which once occupied this cramped storefront, Angelina's food isn't a bit duff in any sense.   If I had to level one criticism at Angelina's, it's that their pizza is yet another spongy, doughy contestant in the forever burning Brookline Pizza Wars. The only thing that really sets this pie apart from its mostly hapless competitors (oh, how Brookline had some serious contenders once...) is that the crust, while typically chewy, sort of pops on your mouth and doesn't require as much jawpower as it normally would. The sauce and cheese were acceptable, but the crust is definitely a rung above average.   Another weapon this incarnation of Angelina's has in its arsenal is an uncommon dessert menu. DJ J. mentioned the Banana Cream Pizza, but as tempting a read as it was, Kay and I opted for the gory looking Strawberry Chocolate Delight Pizza. Milk chocolate, cream cheese, fresh strawberry, and shredded coconut top Angelina's homemade dough, and despite its resemblance to roadkill, this was the highpoint of our delivered meal. The tartness of the plump strawberries and cream cheese bounced off the richness of the chocolate sauce while the coconut provided crisp, textural percussion. It was akin to a supergroup jamming the night away in a small club.   They ain't Krazy. They're Angelina's. And that's just fine by me.",

    "text": "I have loved ordering from Angelina's since their original location in Dormont. And when they moved to their new location I was still a loyal customer. I love their spinach and feta pizza! Best pie in the burgh. But I will never be ordering from here again. Here's why... It was a weekday night but it was a pens hockey night so the kitchen was understandably busy. I was told I would have a wait of 45 minutes to an hour. I live in an apartment building so when the driver arrives they usually call when they're outside and I come to the door to meet them. Not this time. The driver was obnoxiously hooking his horn out front. At the time I had no idea this was the driver, as he had no sign on his car. So I ignored it. Few minutes later my phone rings. The conversation... Me: hello  Pizza guy: uh yeah this Angelina's I'm outside with your pizza Me: I'll be right out I went to the door grab my pizza from the driver that looked completely doped out. My bill was $20.02 I had accidentally given him $21(4 $5s and $1) when I meant to give him $26 so he would have a whole $5 tip. I would have never realized this but as he left he screamed \"yeah thanks for the .98 tip\" I'm server so I always always leave 20%. It was a total mistake on my part. But I'm glad I left him less than a dollar because that was so unprofessional and so trashy. Plus the pizza was cold. Called the manager immediately after this happened and explained this to him, he seemed concerned, told me he'd call back but never did. I probably ordered pizza from here 2-3 a month and would highly recommend it to people. Never again. I'm in the service industry and I would never treat a guest the way these employees have treated me. Totally. Unprofessional. And. Careless.",
