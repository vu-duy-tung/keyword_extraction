The menu is right out of the '70s, with period appetizers such as \"spinach artichoke dip\", \"potato skins\",and  \"wing dings\".  A typical meat and seafood heavy menu, the quality of food is anything but typical!    Reasonable prices, good Pittsburgh-style food, heaps of local \"color\", and a friendly staff makes Kretzler's a great place for families and friends.  And, as always, a satisfying and uniquely Pittsburgh dining experience.  Note: Hands down, best fish sandwich in town!",

Then we ordered the provolone sticks, which were pretty good, but a little greasy. The problem was that we didn't have any utensils or napkins to wipe our hands off with. We asked our waitress for some and we still did not get any. Then, she gave us bread and butter, with no knife to cut the bread with. About 15 minutes after we got the bread, she came over with a side salad, which again, we asked for utensils. She finally came over with utensils, but one of the forks was dirty with leftover food stuck in it.  Our food came at 7:20, which was an hour after we ordered. I got a chicken caesar salad. There was way too much dressing on it, to the point of making the lettuce soggy and the chicken had veins stuck in it.  Overall, the appetizer was good, but the service was very very slow. My salad was way too soggy.",

    "text": "Years ago, I came here quite a bit.  Lots of fun, good food and the service was fine.  That was years ago.  The original owners have, from what I've been told, turned the place over to their sons, and the differences are appalling.  The food has gone sharply downhill, aside from the fish sandwiches, which still are a major draw during the lenten season.  Food is often cold, improperly prepared, or simply wrong.  Different servers almost every time you visit ( high turnover is never a good sign for a restaurant), and an interesting phenomenon: at least one urinal in the men's room is almost always out of order.  The bar is another matter.  Many of the bar staff I was familiar with are gone, replaced with younger, less experienced bartenders who are more interested in socializing with customers than serving them.  Additionally, how does any bar worth visiting run out of any major brand of alcohol on a Friday night??? This happened on at least two of my most recent visits.  I always try to give a local place the benefit of the doubt, but I've run out of patience.  Maybe the sons will sell the place (another rumor I've heard recently), and give someone who might care a chance.  Either way, I'll miss the old Kretzler's.",

    "text": "The service at this establishment has changed since I frequented it in my 20's. My husband and I were in for the Steelers game this past week and were pretty much ignored by the bartender. While it is understandable that any place has its locals, those who are patrons and not locals deserve the same service. The bartender seemed almost annoyed that we were there. She never made eye contact, walking back and forth in front of us to serve others. She never once asked us if we would like another beverage. Our total bill came to about $50 so it is evident that we spent money. The food was mediocre at best, even for bar food. Having previously been in the service industry myself, I can say with certainty that she should have at least approached us at least once in the few hours we were there. We had to keep trying to get her attention, oftentimes being either unheard or just ignored. I cannot say for certain. When someone is spending that much in a short amount of time (we left at halftime to seek another establishment with better service) and still tips the standard 20%, it would be nice to have a bartender who at least acknowledges your presence. It wasn't busy at the bar that day at all, so I can only surmise she thought of us as a nuisance.  I have been here many times when I visit my family in the north hills. This was my first poor experience.",

Apparently the times have changed. Tonight our party of 18 (yes a reservation was made) was subjected to some of the worst service and food I've ever had the displeasure of experiencing. We waited patiently for an hour for our house salads, which were still subpar. When my New York Strip came another 30 minutes or so later, it was well done, no where close to the medium I ordered. The list of problems, including the fact that twice I went without a refill for over half an hour,  is too long to take even take the time to write here, but I will be emailing the owner with a detailed complaint. It saddens me to take this off of my list of one of my favorite places to eat in the North Hills, but after tonight's complete debacle, I have no choice.",

It wasn't bad, but not what one would expect when they see \"stuffed pretzel\".  My wife ordered the meatball hoagie with potato pancakes, and me, the beef and cheddar melt.  The meatball, my wife said, was just average, but the potato pancakes, we both agreed, were pretty darn good.  The beef and cheddar, oh the beef and cheddar... AWFUL! It was tasteless and so dry that I could barely swallow it... I asked for some au jus thinking it would help... It didn't, mainly because the au jus sucked as well.  Our waitress was nice, no overly personable, but nice, young and a bit shy I believe.  She apologized for the sandwich and took it off the bill...  I don't see any reason to ever go back...",

The sandwiches are fuel for the defensive line of an upstate, redneck football team, and they are spectacular. The French Onion Soup is blanketed in a thick, delicious drape of warm, bubbly cheese. The waitresses are total chocolate covered pretzel ladies - a little sweet, a little salty. The decor is nonexistent, and I'm ok with that.

We were sat immediately and they easily accommodated our request to have a booth even though we were first brought to a table.  I had the hot sausage sandwich which comes with grilled onions and peppers, and melted provolone cheese on an Italian roll.  This thing was tastyyyyyy!  I definitely recommend a little marinara sauce either on it or on the side, because you just can't have hot sausage without some sauce in my humble partially Italian opinion.  I really enjoyed how the sausage was a patty so there was no biting into a link and having it shoot out the back end of the sandwich or that gross snap of biting into casing.  I had the potato pancakes as my side (I know, weird combo but I was told I had to try them).  They were good, but a little too thick and a little bland.  Not really a reason to come here, but definitely not a reason to avoid the place.  My mom had the fries which were quite tasty.  The service was very friendly in the classic Pittsburgh fashion.  My drink was always filled and I left well caffeinated after my many glasses of Pepsi.  The wait for the food was a little longer than average, but didn't leave me hungry for too long.  I'll definitely be back here when I'm in the mood for some tasty, no frills kind of food.",

It doesn't matter, Kretzler's will please any crowd.    Surprisingly diverse list of beers on tap, including a few craft brews along side your Coors and Miller Lite.  They'll let you order food at the bar which I've never done however I have noticed that food seems to be served faster at the bar.  The hostess may not seem like the friendliest person when you first arrive for the restaurant side, especially when it's busy.  But when that place is hopping she keeps things organized and moving efficiently.  Wait staff is friendly.  I've had several food items on the menu over my many visits including the Tavern Salad (stacked with veggies and mixed greens), always satisfying appetizers and munchies, and several sandwiches and hoagies (turkey club, reuben, classic burger and of course the fish sandwich).  The portions will not leave you hungry and if you doubt that, just know that they have a new burger challenge called the Buzzy Dunkle Schnitzel Burger.  This menu item is described as an \"obnoxious\" two 8 oz burger patties, two fried eggs, cheese, bacon, fries and slaw.  I'm very tempted by the challenge and reward of a free t-shirt if I consume this hefty burger.  Stay tuned for updates.",

A thick piece of cod or haddock, not breaded but dipped in a light beer batter and fried to golden perfection and served on a soft sesame bun. The coleslaw is fresh and chilled. The beer selection is nice and delivered cold. EAT LOTSA FISH...",

Their soups are made on site.  The cream of spinach and broccoli soups are delicious ... the navy bean soup is OUTSTANDING.  This restaurant is like Cheers that the waitresses know the regulars - a very large group of people.  It is a comfort food menu ... you won't find tofu or sushi here.  They also have a party room - meetings, wakes, card players.   Did I mention the 28 beers on tap?",

Fried mushrooms undercooked, qusadilla stuffed with crap that doesn't belong in a quesadilla (black olives, tomatoes, etc.) So-called Buffalo wings dry to the bone and seven teeny, tiny sorry little shrimp in the shrimp \"basket\".  Having previously had absolutely fantastic meals in the dining room in the evenings, this visit was a complete disappointment.  Somebody please call the police.....Kretzler's just ROBBED me for $52.15 !!!!! (App wouldn't let me post ZERO stars)",

The place was less than half full (12 people in addition to our party) but it still took over an hour to finally get our food, closer to 90 minutes actually and we weren't an exceptionally large party, 14 people and 2 of them were children of 5 years.  My sister-in-law's steak was so over-cooked it was inedible. My brother's liver dinner was like rubber. Another brother's fish sandwich wasn't even assembled, he got a small piece of fish on a plate with a bun and a piece of lettuce on the side that he had to ask for after the fish was delivered. My nephew's fries were burned and inedible. They also have no appreciation for food allergies, I have a mild allergy to root vegetables, especially onions. I ordered cole slaw as the side for my sandwich, 99% of the time a very safe choice vs a salad for me, There was nothing stated on the menu that there are onions in the cole slaw and who puts onions in cole slaw anyway? I realized it after I tasted it, I just hope I'm not up all night with a reaction to it.  We were seated by the kitchen, the profanity coming from the kitchen was inexcusable, unprofessional and inappropriate, especially with 2-5 year old children right outside.  The only saving grace was our waitress, she tried her best to keep us all happy but unfortunately couldn't do anything about the quality of the food or the kitchen staff. I hope that she soon finds a new job at a better place. None of my family members will be returning there.",

My husband and I took the boys out after a game of laser tag to feed them at their normal feeding times of every 4 hours. I am not kidding these monsters (boys) eat several meals a day if we let them.  The menu is larger than what I thought and contain things like Devinshire over toast, Pittsburgh best fish sandwich and A few different clubs. We went old school and all ordered different types of sandwiches. One son got the classic cheeseburger and it was freshly made cheeseburger with fresh toppings. Another got the fiesta burger and it was he being high with topping. Another got the Philly cheesesteak and onion rings both were delicious! My husband picked the Rachael and he did not even offer me a bite. From the lack of conversation that happened at the table I would say this place is a winner among all of the men.  I was super pleased with a bill that was just at 40 bucks for five people! So no this place is not hip and the crowd does contain lots of folks over 70 but we will return again because of the value, customer service and the overall down-home feeling.",

I wanted the 14 oz ribeye with potato pancakes, apple sauce and soup of the day. I was with my daughter and we ordered the ranch dry rub wings as an app. Service was excellent. However the wings were super salty. The salt overpowered the ranch flavor and the chicken. When we started to order we were informed that the dinner menu isn't available until after 4 pm and it was only 2:30. They were also out of potato pancakes. I was very disappointed and suggested they put that time limitation on their website and menu as it was not listed anywhere. We drove 30 minutes to try this place out. I doubt we will make the trip again.",

There was not a parking space anywhere, we actually had to drive around behind the building and park in a tight spot next to a dumpster. Walked in the door and we weren't even greeted, the hostess didn't ask how many were in our party or tell us how long of a wait it would be or say two words to us. I couldn't tell you what the fish tastes like because we turned around and walked out after 15 minutes of standing in the entrance next to the \"please wait to be seated\" sign while at least 3 staff members walked past us. I understand we came at a busy time but they could have at least acknowledge someone waiting to be seated. Maybe if we came at a different time we would have received better service, but after reading other reviews it doesn't sound like there's better service at any time.",

When the food came they gave me fries instead of the potato pancakes I ordered and the chicken strips were aweful all I could taste was burnt grease. At this point I was so disappointed I didn't even want to complain just get out of there.

They charged me the full price, even though the menu had the same exact item on it (without that component) for a few bucks less.  Very minor discrepancy on total cost, but I found it incredibly obnoxious to treat customers that way.  They lost me as a customer over $1.50, based entirely on principle.    If you're going to run out of all specials and menu items, and not even update the board in the front, you should at least do so with some class and tact.    You also can't just unilaterally decide to not include elements that are listed on the menu because the kitchen is out of them.  In the industry, the proper procedure is to let the customer know and then provide an alternative option.  Will not be returning.",

I came for the sole purpose of trying the legendary fish sandwich - which did not disappoint. It was good to know we could sub out bun/bread options (if food allergies are a concern ie: sesame seed buns aplenty on the menu.) My husband had the chicken breast sandwich (batter dipped) and added buffalo hot sauce for $1. I liked chicken, however, it did get a bit lost on the hoagie bun so try for the suggested sesame bun or perhaps the white, wheat, or tortilla wrap. Potato pancakes were a hit!

When the waitress brought it out it was a tavern salad with shrimp (fries and a bunch of veggies I didn't want) ... When I pointed out that it was wrong her excuse was she was new do she didn't know and asked if I wanted it remade.  I said yes cause I wanted it to be what I ordered ... When she brought it back it was the same salad minus the fries and added the Bleu cheese and bacon ... So I still had to pick out the veggies I didn't want ...

    "text": "Kretzler's Tavern has been part of the North Hills dining and drinking scene for as long as I can remember (40+ years).  The place has continued to evolve over time but maintained their German slant on beer and food.  I enjoyed a nice cold Hacker Pschorr Munich Gold draft on tap tonight with my fish sandwich and perfectly seasoned potato cake with applesauce.  They feature more than 27 beers on tap which is nice and have a full bar area with high top tables and some games.   Their fish batter is a tad bland but the fish was white, fresh, and meaty so that sort of made up for the batter.  The potato pancakes were exactly like my dear Mother used to make: shredded potatoes with minced onion and egg that is formed into a cake and pan fried on high heat to give the outside that crispy texture and keep the inside moist.  My partner loved the coleslaw too.   The chairs and tables are beautiful rustic wood with a dark stain that must have recently been refinished.  Business was brisk with many casual diners still streaming in as we finished up around 8:45PM.  We love to find places that will accommodate some later dining so this one goes onto the short list of North Hills restaurants with later dinner bells.   Our waitress was very attentive and courteous which created a nice dining experience. The rest of the menu is staple diner/home cooked food like steaks/chops, sandwiches, burgers, and appetizers.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited this restaurant because we were looking for a chill place to drink beer and watch football games and we were blown away by the hospitality, great food, cheap drinks, and relaxing atmosphere. You could tell this place was the hang out spot for locals, but the workers treated us \"out of towners\" great and we felt at home. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant if you're looking for bar food and great drinks. I started off by ordering the stuffed pretzel as an appetizer: AMAZING. Then I ordered the tavern style salad with buffalo chicken tenders and my boyfriend ordered the Philly cheesesteak sandwich. Both great options. We thoroughly enjoyed this restaurant and if we're ever back in Pittsburgh, we will make sure to eat here again!!",

I just left because I wanted for 15 minutes for a waitress that never showed up, while a gaggle of them sat at a corner table gabbing.  I waived at them a few times and was ignored.  TJE FOOD IS GOOD HERE, but the service is usually slow and bad.  Mr. Kretzler, fire the dead wait, you'd be better off.  Especially since you're in an area where there's TONS OF competition.  I went to Montecellos a block away, got greeted, got drinks and an appetizer in the same amount of time it took me not to get service at Kretzlers.",

    "text": "I often drive past this place and always thought that it looks more like a bar then a restaurant from the outside. However, during my first visit here last night I found out that this is not the case.  You do , however, enter the bar area to go into the rather large sized dining room. The first thing that caught my attention  was the unique looking  dining room chairs.  They appear to be custom made and tree branches were used to form the backs of the chairs. Further beyond the main dining room is another separate, more private dining room for parties etc.. I also noticed a door in the rear of the building allowing access to both the main dining room and the private one.  The menu looked very inviting with plenty of good options.  I finally decided to try their fish sandwich since this is one of their known specialties  and my friend decided on the Reuben.  We ended up splitting our sandwiches and both were of good quality and very filling. The server mentioned that they offer homemade soups on a regular basis but it is hard to know which soup will be featured on any given day.  Last night featured a hearty navy bean soup. The prices are very reasonable and we look forward to another visit.",

Do yourself a favor- go to another restaurant, there are plenty in the North Hills that offer better food and service",
