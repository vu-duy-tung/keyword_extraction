The bread is yummy and if you eat at the restaurant then you get a free side of fries. Now I consider myself a fry expert and I have a great appreciation when my fries are fresh. They make every order right when you pick up or right before they bring you your sandwich. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. One of the best sandwiches in Pittsburgh.",

My first time I ordered the chicken cheese stake sandwich. It was great. If you eat in, you get free fries.  My 2nd and 3rd time I got the Philly cheese steak. IT WAS AMAZING. I went Philly style (which they didn't appreciate) so I axed the provolone and got cheese sauce on the side. It ended up being pretty brilliant to get the cheese on the side because their sandwiches are large and in charge, so leftovers are welcomed. I must admit, the leftovers were just as tasty as they were fresh (if reheated properly - toaster oven and wrapped in foil).   Anyways, their sandwiches are nothing short of amazing and the fries are just as great.   They do tend to get packed during lunch time and space is limited. Also, everything is made to order so expect a small wait, a wait worth while.",

    "text": "I thought this place was great and was super impressed by my cheesesteak.  Located in a strip mall, it's a busy place especially around lunch time during the week.  It has the old school diner type of vibe when you walk in and they even have the counter where you can eat.  It's a seat yourself type of place and it can be difficult to find a table during the week.  You order at the counter and then seat yourself.  It's not a waiter/waitress type of place.  When your order is ready, they walk around and just yell out your number so you have to listen up.    I can't remember the exact name of the sandwich I ordered but it was one of their specialties and it was basically a regular cheesesteak.  They asked me if I wanted to add lettuce, tomato, onions and mayo to my sandwich.  Yes, yes, yes and yes.  They have fountain soda for your beverage.  When we sat down (yes, we were able to get a table), I was a little disappointed because we didn't order any french fries.  Much to my surprise, every sandwich is served with a ton of french fries (included and they were great).  I was impressed by that.  The cheesesteak was near excellent.  It was huge and there was a ton of meat.  It's definitely one of the better cheesesteaks I've had.  I threw some ketchup on it and it was complete.  If I lived in the area, I would definitely come here from time to time.  The portions are huge so it's not exactly the kind of place you can come to very often.    The only knock I have against this place is that the food took a while to get served.  I understand they are busy but you have to do a quick job during the week for lunch.  You need to get people in and out.  Each sandwich was about $9 which is completely reasonable considering they all came with a ton of fries.  It's definitely a solid spot.",

Entering the Bar we liked what we saw on the menu and ordered with delight.  I ordered an Italian Sausage Works  and my friend a Cheese Steak.  The ingredients looked and were very fresh, but the sandwiches had absolutely NO taste at all.  They were boring and we both couldn't believe just how bad they actually were. Even the root beer float was lame.  Soft mushy ice cream in a great root beer.  For the next few days, every time we passed this place we scoffed at the waste of time and money we spent there.  Save yourself the money and buy a hot air balloon, suck on it...chew the air and you will get the same flavor....but at least you will get a humorous sound when you say \"Yucky!\".",

I don't know what the names of the employees who worked in between 2-4pm are but their attitudes were abysmal. The one woman was very condescending when she was taking my order. The other woman was rude in general. I wanted my sandwich wrapped and instead of handing it to me when she was done, she dropped it on the counter and said \"here you go\" in the worst tone possible. I noticed that the cook wasn't doing much, but I did notice that he was texting and not wearing gloves while cooking. So all in all, I will not be going back there again. There are many other sandwich shops out there so I won't miss anything. Especially when I can get better customer service at places like Subway.",

I think she just couldn't wait to get back to chatting with her co-worker.  She just flat out ignored one gentleman who asked where the soda machine was.

The fries are also great and they give you a lot of fries. Really could not eat them all.  Overall pretty good.  I would go back again.",

After they served it to me, I watched them cook the rest of the orders on the same grill same area with meat and veggies together. They have two large grills big enough to make separate areas for meat and veggies. I thought this was standard practice in the restaurant business. And then I watched her clean it leaving bacon crumbs behind on the grill. I wanted to say something but I was scared because the girls in there were kind of rude. If you want to cook that way it's fine, but don't say \"vegetarian\" on the menu.",

I didn't think I was waiting long at all and not really sure how this all happened.  As the server handed me my to go order of the sub with the side of fries, I asked her how much.  She looked at the guy working the flat top he smiled and just put his fist up.  The girl smiled and handed it to as if it was just free.  What?!?!?! I was so confused.  I tried to pay and they said it was a good day.  The guy gave me a \"pound\" and I was on my way.  The New Yorker in me just could not believe that an experience like that just happened......  I just couldn't believe that just happened.  Someone out of the blue just decided that dinner was on them....    I got home and tasted the fries.. AWESOME.  Kind of like shoe string fries, skinny and perfectly salted.  The SUB WAS REALLY REALLY GREAT!  I am still reeling about this whole experience.  I don't know if they knew what they were doing, but they just made a fan out of me.  Such a small gesture (less than $10 worth) just gained them a lifetime of business.  Not just a fan of Uncle Sam's but that particular location.  Happy people making other people happy.  I will tell everyone I know about this place.",

I had just picked my husband up from the airport and we wanted to go someplace and not wait in line. Crazy huh???  We decided to give this place a try and I'm glad we did.  I ordered an Ultimate Cheesesteak and my husband ordered an Italian. It seriously one of the best cheesesteaks I've ever had. The bread was fresh and had been warmed on the grill. The steak was very flavorful. I ended up taking half home because it came with a mountain of fries. I took some of those home as well. Their fries are thinner like McDonald's fries. They make them when ordered so they are hot and crispy. They also have fresh brewed iced tea which I love. My hubby got a beer with his sandwich. They have a decent beer selection and some 6 packs to go.  I'm very surprised that they didn't have a long line waiting but they do a lot of take out. The employees are super nice and the restaurant is incredibly clean.",

They had bottled Boylan Soda (root beer, cream soda) . Also they had beer and fountain drinks. Free fries comes with your sandwich for dining in. Also, they take cards unlike the waterworks location! :)  I ordered the Ultra Mushroom Cheesesteak which had mushrooms, grilled onions, cheese, lettuce, tomato & mayo. Bobby ordered the same thing. The sub was delicious and so filling. We each only ate half.   Again, ive never had a bad cheesesteak from uncle sams. Love it!",

This place deserves more than the measly five stars I have bestowed upon it. They are not just a restaurant; they are a sanctuary, an escape, proof that good people will always triumph in this world. Oh, and their food is dope.   I'm on my final leg of our trip across the county. After a tire blow out halfway between Chicago and Philadelphia (our final destination) we got waylaid and had to make an unexpected pit stop in Pittsburgh. Little did I know our misfortune was just lady fortune masquerading as disaster.   After a long drive and hours standing in the rain, we were desperate for a hoagie near our hotel. Well, yelp came through big time and recommended this place right across the street from our hotel.   I expected nothing, but got everything.   We ordered a hot Italian sub and a couple beers (who knew they'd carry some tasty local beers at crazy cheap price). Cashier was super friendly and our total was like 14 dollars. That would barely get me one bottle of beer in the Bay Area, let alone our whole meal with 2 beers.   Food was great, staff seemed to be having a good time, and there were some cops chowing down in the corner (which means this must be a good local spot and that this was the safest meal I would have that week).  The icing on the cake was our parting gift. Out of the kindness of his heart, because he saw our overloaded SUV and respected the adventure we too, the friendly (I'm assuming manager? Owner? Original Uncle Sam? Flava Flav-ish hype dude?) manager went out of his way to grab us two bottles of the beers we bought and stuck them in a brown bag as a parting gift for us.   I mean, who does that anymore? After a long day on the road with car trouble after a long week of adventure; we got our cake iced.   Thank you kind sir. Thank you Uncle Sam's. Your kindness has warmed my heart and soul.   Mahalo for your Kakuah!",

This visit I got the skinny steak. Basically a cheesesteak without the cheese. I don't even know why I bothered. There's a reason there's cheese on a cheesesteak. It wasn't terrible though. The last time I was here I got the mushroom steak and it was so good!   It does get packed during lunch time during the week though. They do have other sandwich options on the menu and also some vegetarian sandwiches.",

We got the ultra sam's special, ultra philly cheese steak  and sweet potato fries. They were fast so we were able to in and out within 15 minutes I would say. The fries were very crispy and comes with a large amount and for only $3! That is the deal! Both cheese steak were very good and we both liked it. I would say this place is a spot that when you don't know what to eat for a quick bit around the area. Who doesn't like cheese steak right?",

I love their special Italian sub, and their fries are to die for. They kind of remind me of McDonalds fries, but a little thicker.   I've only ever gotten the Italian sub because it's consistently amazing, but they have several unique menu items I'd be willing to try. There's interesting items like the cheeseburger sub and the buffalo chicken sub which sound delicious.  I've never been to any other Uncle Sam's locations, but this one serves beer. Also, you get a pretty decent amount of food for the price you pay. Each sandwich is about $8.50-$9 including fries.   This restaurant offers quality delicious food for a cheap price, and the staff are super friendly.

Service was descent though I'm not greeted at the door or at the register I am still treated with respect. Uncle Sams has a good sports environment with a multitude of tv's available.  When I eat here i typically eat the buffalo chicken sub. If you are a person who does not like really hot sauces I would not recommend. They use fresh bread that I believed is delivered every morning. The produce is not the best so I typically get my subs without.   On occasion I eat the philly cheese steak hoagie with the sauteed peppers. This is a descent option for a philly cheese steak. I would recommend. Another benefit to getting there subs is that each of them come accompanied with an order of the their fires if you eat in.       I ventured off from subs once and got a burger and was simply not impressed. I initially was not expecting much, and not much is what I received. Again the produce was not good so I do not recommend.   All in all this is a great dive bar for good hoagies and fries. With a good sports environment.",

My boyfriend ordered a sub with a side of cheese. When we got our food there was NO steak on my salad & he didn't get his cheese till after he was half done with everything. When I realized I didn't have steak on my salad, the Cook was really nice about making me some but I said to forget it and said thanks tho. The young girl that took the order seem to not care about messing up on our order and didn't get a sorry or anything. I know mistake happen buttt for it being so dead there with literally no one, I was so disappointed and same with my boyfriend. We probably won't be back.",

    "text": "So this spot is tucked away in a little plaza. We had went to Comcast and saw that Uncle Sams was near so we decided that we needed to stop.  Well i decided to get the classic cheese steak sub. It was really good and had the right amount of cheese (this was actually my first time trying Uncle Sam's). The fries were perfect and cooked crispy just the way I like them.  The staff were all pleasant and we received our food pretty quickly. I loved the atmosphere and just the general feeling that other customers were enjoying themselves. Plus I loved the music. 90's and early 2000's is where it's at for me.   I would absolutely recommend this place if you ever feel the need to try a new cheese steak.",

    "text": "Uncle Sam's is a total throwback to a good old fashioned sub shop.  There are hot subs, cold subs, veggie subs, a little something for everyone.  Last time I went, I got a cold salami and cheese sub and my boyfriend got a mushroom cheesesteak.  We both agreed that the bread was super fresh and the ingredients were all delicious.  We ate at the restaurant, so our fries and cheese sauce were included with our meal.  If you get a meal to go, you do have to pay extra for a side of fries.  I wasn't able to finish my sub, so the employees were super nice and wrapped it all up for me to take home.  If you're in the mood for a sub, upgrade from the chains and go to Uncle Sam's!",

You walk up to the counter for placing your order they give you a slip and call your order and bring it to the table. I will admit something's looked pretty good and I seen they had sweet potato fries so I had to try some cause I love them. I got a big basket with cheese and bbq. The fries portion was huge for $4 I was stoked but I was hoping for something with more flavor I guess. The cheese is what I would call fake baseball game cheese I think it's good but some people seem to hate it. The bbq tasted like sweet baby rays so that was good and they did have season all out for people so I grabbed some of that for the fries. The service was fast and the food was good I'll definitely be returning to try the buffalo chicken sandwich next time I'm in the area.",

The fries you get as a side when you order in are pretty basic, but tasty and compliment the food nicely.  While the idea of the Ultra subs is nice (more steak and toppings), the bread/meat/topping taste ratio does not taste as good as their regular offerings.",

The food is pretty par and the menu is very short. We got to 2 cheesesteaks and a side of fries. The cheesesteaks were OK and kind of small for the price. The fries were big enough for both of us to share.  The staff was OK. They seem to be more interested in conversing amongst themselves than dealing with any customers.  I would go back to this place if I was driving by but would not go out of my way to go back.",

The fries and service were fine, and I'm sure they're great people, but I came for the steak.  There's a sign on the wall that pretty much sums it up.  Never trust a skinny cook!",

The chicken was scarce on my sandwich. One half barely had chicken at all. The steak sandwich is usually stuffed with steak and it wasn't today. The fries had been sitting awhile and couldn't figure out what all the burnt ones were and finally found out those were sweet potato fries. They were clearly indistinguishable. On another note, went to the women's restroom and obviously a lot of others had gone too. Two toilets and not one would flush. The restaurant was filthy. Don't think one table had been cleaned. Will not be back for a long while if at all.",
