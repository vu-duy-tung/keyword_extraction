When you go in on of the entrances of the Museum of Art it will be in front of the large glass window facing Forbes Ave and the fountain. You can pick up sandwiches and cold foods from the cases or order hot food at the register. Their menu very pretty diverse so its good for all ages. Its cafeteria style unless you order hot. If you order hot food they bring it to the table. Meals are under $10.  My favorite item is their salmon cake with asparagus and wild rice. It was amazing! The best I ever had.",

On the down side, their french fries tasted like they were from McDonalds - but were three times the price.  For the price and decor, my lunch should have packed far more of a flavorful punch. When the menu description boasts of jalapeno, homemade bread, and dill aioli, I should be savoring each bite. Instead, I ate a boring shrimp sandwich. Shrimp was overcooked and hardly seasoned and the bread was not the right fit for what they were going for.  I'm pretty bummed out because upon entering, I was excited to have a new place to take clients for lunch meetings. But I don't want my clients to leave the meeting feeling unfulfilled from lunch and have that affect their insights of our discussion. Bummer.",

And they're good.  The food was also excellent - the french toast with brie and lemon compote was delicious.  If you're looking for a traditional sausage and eggs style breakfast, this isn't the place to come - but if you wanna be a little fancy, this is the place.

I have to say from the moment I walked in I knew I was going to enjoy our lunch. I love museums and always appreciate a good museum cafeteria! Calling this a cafeteria though is of course not fair. It's much more than that! It's a wonderful dining experience. I didn't spend much time looking at the menu because as soon as I saw savory crepes I knew I nothing else on the menu could beat it! And I'm so glad I got them. They were excellent. The blend of chicken, mushrooms, peas and to die for sauce has me still thinking about them days later! I loved my cold brew coffee and the uniforms for the wait staff! I know I will be back!",

Who am I to complain about free lunch?  You walk up to the counter, order, and find a seat.  There is real silverware and plates, but we ended up taking food to go.  They provided us with plasticware and napkins.  The menu is small.  There were four sandwich options, two soups, a salad, and a few other things.  What I really liked is that each sandwich came with a side.  I got the buffalo chicken breast sandwich ($8.75), which had buffalo chicken breast, America cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and pickles.  The sandwich was large and tasted good.  I had two little cheese and sun-dried tomato risotto bites.  They were delicious, and I wish there had been more.  Apparently the chips for a side are good as well, and there were quite a few of those in a portion.  The service was friendly, and everyone was happy with lunch!",

Five of us passed around our entrees to see what the others thought of the dish, and the taste of it. Five of us agreed the menu is too odd, with too many ingredients that no one knows what they are, and the dishes simply didn't taste good. The ONLY thing we all agreed was good was a shrimp roll... though quite skimpy... we think it was 4 shrimp for $16.00???   It's trying to hard to be unusual.... For museum fare, I'll stick with Phipps or the Frick.  The service was impeccable, really a fantastic staff. The setting is great, but very cold... dress warm in the winter. It's also quite pricey for the quality. They need to come up with a better menu.",

Located in the front entrance of the Carnegie Museum of Art the cafe overlooks the fountain and, well, Forbes Avenue.  But it's serene and lovely and you feel just a little fancy here.  Except that the service is cafeteria style.  So you order, grab a tray, and go do the line and pay at the end.  Oh, and you pick up an empty cup and get yourself a soda.  Kinda takes away from the ambiance.    Nice lunch options and the prices are reasonable.  I had a half sandwich (ham, brie, on a cute little biscuit) and a bowl of soup (asparagus) and a drink (iced tea) and I think it came to about $11.  While you order and pay in a cafeteria style environment, the food is cooked to order and then served to your table by wait staff.  I'm not going to dine here everyday for lunch because I'm just not that fancy and there are so many options for lunch in Oakland.  However, I will come here frequently and sit and watch the fountains and enjoy the environment.",

The crab sandwich I had recently was exactly what I was looking for that day, and I really enjoy their broccoli/bacon side dish.

I felt compelled to do so because this was such a horrible eating experience. The atmosphere was quite nice and the service was fine but the food was grossly (pun intended) overpriced but wouldn't have been good at any price.   I took my family of 4 there after a day at the museum. All of us were equally disappointed. The daily special was banana pancakes. In order to 'elevate' it they mixed the butter with thyme. Both of the boys, who do NOT have discriminating palates, commented, \"How can you screw up pancakes\". Per their words, \"I had to choke it down.\" I ordered a vegetable pot pie that was so small I could have finished it in a couple of bites. Instead I had to pick through the slimy sauce to get to the vegetables which tasted like they came from a can. The highlight was my wife's salad which was nothing special but was at least 'fine'.   I understand the inflated prices that come with visiting a place like the museum but for $70 I expected better.  For $5 I would have expected better. The old grille was very good and much more reasonably priced.  I would frequently meet people there for lunch even if I wasn't at the museum. Not anymore. Take the 5 minutes and walk over to Craig Street to eat.",

The service was slow so all of the dishes arrived close together and luke warm. To start we ordered the cinnamon buns and the grilled artichokes (I know, strange pairing).Unfortunately the cinnamon buns were super dry and dense and lacked flavor. The artichokes were fine but the presentation was underwhelming. The whole wheat spaghetti carbonara was delicious and a good portion for lunch. The omelet was done nicely but definitely could have been seasoned with salt and pepper which isn't at the tables (which I get in a nice restaurant we shouldn't have to use it but it was needed). Our server was polite but definitely green. Overall pleasant experience because it was a beautiful Sunday afternoon but just wish the food and service was a notch higher.",

The soup was straight from a plastic bag and very oily. I have been to so many museum cafes around the world where the food was a work of art in flavor and presentation. This is not one of them.

The ambiance was very nice, with classy decorations and a good view. I enjoyed the light display and the tall windows that allowed diners to see the pleasing fountain display.  For a Saturday morning it wasn't too busy and my friend and I were able to secure a table without a reservation. The staff was cordial and helpful. Our waitress made some pretty good suggestions regarding the menu. Everything seemed delicious and there appeared to be good vegetarian selections as well.   We took her suggestion and ordered the Bocadillo di Tortilla for $13 and a short stack of pancakes for $7. The name tortilla is a bit misleading: it's actually a sandwich with two thick slices of bread around arugula, manchego, aioli and an egg, spinach, and potato frittata. The sandwich was decent. The crispiness of the bread paired well with the soft frittata. However, it wasn't too outstanding, I'm not sure if I would order it again. It was nice to try it. I would consider it a good experiment as opposed to what I usually order. Although the short stack seemed small it was still quite filling and soaked well with maple syrup. The pancake was soft and fluffy, very satisfying.  The portions were quite generous so we ended up packing up our leftovers.  Overall, I would come back here again. It's reasonably priced for a brunch place and has a nice atmosphere. I definitely want to try their banana pancakes next time!",

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about The Cafe Carnegie. It is an absolutely beautiful place to visit for breakfast or lunch and it's a refreshing alternative to the other options on S Craig Street.   Pros: An incredible option for a coffee meeting with a colleague or business prospect during the week. The coffee prices are average and they have some tasty options including their nitro cold brew. This is a great alternative to the small Starbucks that is close by. It can be quiet here before lunch, so it's also a great place to have a coffee and get some work done or study.   Cons: Not the best lunch casual lunch option. The prices are steep and the portions are small. The food is good, but it's not great enough to justify the high cost. If you are looking for a more formal place to meet a business prospect it can be a great option, but it's not great when you're really hungry and not looking to spend a chunk of change for lunch.  Overall, I really do love the Cafe Carnegie as a place to meet people and have coffee. Maybe I will try it out for lunch another time, but for now I am sticking with the coffee",

    "text": "This is only getting 2 stars because of the service and the attitude of the bartender/barista.  The bar area was open and a three top was available. We got in line to order a coffee and a meal and the barista huffed and said \"if you're going to eat go into the dining area.\" And I said \"is this three top not available?\" To which she rudely said \"look if you're going to eat just go sit in there because they make $2 and I make $9.\" I was floored. So we went to the hostess stand and waited 10 min. Once we finally were sat it was at least another 5-10 before our server came.  After that whole debacle, the meal ran relatively smoothly. I had the bocadilla and it was so amazing! A quiche on homemade bread essentially.  I want to give them a redemption round so I'll be back.",

The cheese plate was a bit puzzling, although the Pirate Blue is outstanding, I'm not sure why the Feta cheese was included.  The Eggplant Parmesan was really excellent, I would definitely order this again. The Burrata with heirloom tomatoes was excellent.   The service could be improved, for example, our server did not know much of anything about the cheese plate.  I'm a huge fan of Sonja Finn, and she has brought things to a much higher level, perhaps she will bring more changes for the better.",

It is usually best to make a reservation since the place gets fairly crowded over the lunch hour. I had one and was deciding whether I wanted to go with a salad or panini. They are now full table service. They serve brunch on the weekends.  I opted for the latter and had the grilled zucchini panini with avocado, mozzarella, and other things on their homemade sourdough bread. I had read that all their sandwiches are made with homemade bread. The sandwiches with the exception of one all come with an order of French Fries.  I got my order and noticed it was slightly burnt along the edges but it didn't stop me from eating it. It actually didn't seem to have much of a flavor nevertheless I found it very filling.   I really on the other hand enjoyed the French fries that went with it. The waitress staff were both friendly and helpful.  This is an okay business for one or two people having lunch but if you are bringing a family it can get pretty costly and there are very few items on it for kids. I believe the museums have another cafe in the basement which is supposed to be more family friendly but I have not had an opportunity to check it out.",

The prices are a bit higher and small portions, as was described not to make you so full that you cannot stay awoke while walking around in the museum. Stay woke!!!!  I tried the deviled eggs, oysters, and watermelon and olive kabob. The deviled eggs are so delicious and definitely a must try! The watermelon and olive kabob was tasty as well. Oysters, meh! The biggest gripe that I had were the drinks. I tried the Sangria and a gin that appeared herbal aromatic. Both did not have any sweetness to it. So I didn't care for that too much, especially with the Sangria. However, the gin was pretty good. I enjoyed the aromatherapy of it--very soothing and relaxing.  This is probably not a place that I would frequent because it is not exactly my style. But I probably will pop in if I just so happen to be at the museum.",

They did use tons of ingredients though and weird cheese, so I guess they thought that was enough.   The sandwich wasn't bad. It was messy so I couldn't use my fingers, but the crust was super hard so it was also nearly impossible to cut with a knife. It was very oily but the flavors were okay. I didn't touch the salad because I don't remember the menu even mentioning a salad coming with it. I am really picky about dressings.

I ordered the lemon lavender gin cocktail, and it was far too lavernder-y. The deviled eggs were bland. The grilled artichoke was hands-down inedible. The worst dish I've ever had. My salad was bland, and my husband's chicken  salad wasn't seasoned. Our waitress never checked in on us. By the time our actual meal came--just sandwiches--the 75 minutes on our meter had to be fed. In that time when my husband was feeding the meter, our food came. The bread on my sandwich was so burned on one side that I couldn't eat it. My husband's fries were cold. The total bill was over $100. For a lunch that last over an hour. We have had way better lunch at Eleven, Bar Marco, the Foundry, Gaucho Parilla Argentina, etc. for at least (if not more) $30 less. We had to get fro yo afterwards because my mouth just tasted like burnt and my husband was still hungry. So awful. Worst meal I've had in Pittsburgh. Eat n Park is far, far better. Do not go here.",

    "text": "I love this place. It's not your normal cafe.For me, I thought the prices were low considering the type of food that was being served. They're not serving dive bar food, the food menu is more upscale. But the prices are on the lower side in my opinion. The quality of the food is excellent.   I'm not sure why people are saying the prices are expensive. Go to a chain cafe and ask how much for a coffee! yea, ouch!   When i'm back in the area... i will certainly come back!",

    "text": "I will allow that the prices are high for Pittsburgh but for me they are normal for where I live and low for what you get.  Be aware that if you are a party of two you will be seated at a European-style two-top close to your neighbors.  This is OK unless said neighbors don't know how to behave and would truly earn any dirty looks they'd garner if they did the same in Paris.  This happened to us.  One of our neighbors was so loud and full of himself he boggled our brains and made us miserable.  We debated getting up and walking up but instead convinced the host to move us instead.  Fortunately all of our new neighbors engaged in much quieter conversation.  We wound up having a very delicious and relaxing lunch here.  We debated the menu until we saw another diner's vegetable pot pie.  It is so cute!  It's a modest puff pastry box with a lid.  Inside were brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, pearl onions, and maybe something else.  The sauce was delectable.  It was served with a simple yet flavorful side salad.  The vinaigrette leaned on the side of featuring the flavor and texture of the high-quality olive oil, which was a good thing.  We also enjoyed the grilled sandwich.  This was an umami explosion of broccoli rabe, egg, and bread, with a little sopresata for flavor.  It was served with a slightly different side salad; dressing was more piquant with more emphasis on the vinegar.  This was a good foil for the decadent egg.  We also shared a double-shot cortado, which we felt was on par with what you'd be served in a European cafe.  Yum.  And it was served in a cute glass.  We enjoyed our food and time.  The entrees were a tad salty for our tastes but we run very sensitive on the salt-meter.  I am looking forward to trying more meals at the Cafe Carnegie.  I will probably try to avoid the smack middle of lunch time.",

    "text": "Had brunch. 4** is out of generosity, more like a 3 & 1/2. Ambiance is nice and cozy. Food is good, but we had much better tasting dishes in museum's restaurants then here. A bit overpriced for what it was. Service was nice and friendly, but not very professional. Unless the weather prevents you from walking 5 minutes, there is much better alternative if in the area called The Porch.",

    "text": "We came here for brunch after a yoga event that took place in the museum. The service, food, and drinks were all great. We had the deviled eggs, jelly donuts, griddled sandwich, and bocadilla de tortilla and it was all fantastic- fresh ingredients, well-prepared, and flavorful. They serve high-quality coffee and also had delicious brunch cocktails- the Bloody Mary and Craig Street Wallbanger were both top notice!  We were seated immediately by the hostess and our server was very attentive. There were a fair amount of people in the restaurant and the food came out very quickly.   I highly recommend this restaurant and plan on returning in the near future.",
