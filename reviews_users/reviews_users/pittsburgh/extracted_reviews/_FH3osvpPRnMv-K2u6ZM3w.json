It's around the corner from my office and its not a chain so yea I hit it up for lunch with the partners in crime once in a while.   the Philly cheese-steak never lets me down, fries portions are huge and you can pretty much split one sandwich and one large Fries with two drinks between two people for around 14$ not bad on the wallet not bad at all.   Plus they have a poster of John Lee Hooker on the wall, plus other celebrity pics who have eaten there over the years.   Service is zippy but it is a cash only joint.... again there is ATM from 1986 sitting in the corner. It looks like it won't work then takes a confusing 30 seconds to spit your money out but it does work. If Peppi's took credit cards I would give them 5 stars.  Probably not a great spot for vegetarians. I don't know of many veg options on the menu. Definitely a Pittsburgh Classic lunch spot, and their sandwich did not give me tummyaches like that other P sandwich shop's sandwich did.",

Any college kid on tight budge can assure you that there are days when only one meal is all you can afford.    Peppi's portions are huge and they don't skimp on either meats, veggies or cheese.  One sub can easily be eaten for lunch with plenty leftovers that can be eaten as dinner.   Typically for me I get the Cajun fries which are delicious cheap and you get a ton.  They are dusted with a spicy Cajun seasoning and served with a side of house made ranch.   Since transferring to college in Oakland I don't get to frequent Peppi's as much but I have nothing but fond memories. Of all the Peppi locations this is by far my favorite.",

Afterall, Primanti's gets rave reviews and I just don't get it. Ah, but soooooo hungry. Ok...I'll try it.   AMAZING. The place isn't dirty. It isn't greasy. It's a sandwich shop people, I really don't know what you expect here that makes you dish out such harsh reviews. You're paying $8 for a meal, it's not going to be 5 star decor. That being said, it was clean, it was moderately busy but not very loud (no more than any other place), and the staff was cool. I tip. If you can't afford to tip don't eat out. And don't complain when they aren't as cool if you don't. I work for tips, but unfortunately I work for corporate America where I have to smile at you even if you are a cheap ass- BUT- don't expect me to go the extra mile. But I digress...on to the food.  It's good! Actually, it's better than good. It's sliced ribeye steak cooked fresh on a flat top grill with fresh cheese and veggies and what just may be the best bread I have ever had. It's got this nice crust, but it isn't \"cut the roof of your mouth hard\" like some places...ahem...Primanti's...and the portions are very generous. The boyfriend and I used to save half so we had a \"now sandwich\" and a \"later sandwich,\" but lately it's been all \"now sandwich.\" When we do carryout, they wrap it up for us just like if it were a take out order. Small deal to you maybe, but that's that extra mile I was talking about. I said, \"I'll just wrap it up myself man, no worries,\" and the guy behind the counter insisted on wrapping it up for me \"no problem.\"   The menu is vast for such a small shop. There are a lot of options, steak, chicken, even vegetarian. There are breakfast selections, spicy, mild, you name it. They have some pretty good fries too. They have a cooler with bottle drinks or fountain drinks and they have some good specials for lunch. Another small detail, they have a good variety in the drink cooler. Dr. Pepper, root beer, ginger ale, juices, water, and the usual soda suspects. I'm a creature of habit so I always get the same thing, and it always tastes exactly the same. That's another plus in my book, consistency. There is nothing worse than getting your favorite whatever at your favorite where-ever and it not being as good as the last time. That doesn't happen here. It's as good as the first time, every time.",

Poland had probably left the country itself to go to Peppi's due to it's delicious tasting Subs.  You figure with waiting at the airport in line at security, delays in a flight schedule and actual flight time itself... the numbers start to add up. One might make the argument that 23 days is still too long of a time for one to take to fly from Poland to Peppi's and back, well I beg to differ due to the downtime one would have after eating there.  Little known fact, while Germany may have gone to war with Poland, you can be sure that a Peppi's sub will go to war with your stomach making you feel well...defeated.   They will throw just about anything on one of those subs which taste amazing but tends not to agree with you as much as you may like. It's a cash only joint much like every place in 1939.   If there is a sporting event taking place, make sure to check out this place, it will in fact rock your very socks off despite any hesitations you may have",

The mayo masked the taste of the other delish ingredients. They have a huge selection so maybe I'll have better luck next time!",

The cajun fries are  particular delightful. Not only is the seasoning that they use fresh (not stale), but it really does give the fries a nice spicy kick that other fries do not have. The fries are also not too oily (yes, can other joints please learn this?) but are fresh, crisp, and not too soggy.  Bread is freshly baked & tasty and the meat used is gorgeously delicious. Recommend the Roethelisburger as a must-get sandwich, along with the Big Wheeler as a close second.",

Many of my friends go here and everyone loves it. I have never heard of anything bad said about peppi's. Good to sit and eat or grab it to go. You wont be unhappy, I promise.",

We looked on Yelp and found Peppi's nearby. I walked in and was SO happy with the whole set up- the space, the vibe, and the people behind the counter. Everyone was patient and pleasant as we made our decisions- the Santucci and the Cathedral.  We asked them to split them 3 ways, and they were very accommodating.  Had I just had the Cathedral, I would have been happy.  But OMG! The Santucci was mind blowing. The bread is great, the ratios were perfect- not too dry or wet- and the grilled vegetables kicked it to another level.  Would totally come back. Thank you for such a great sandwich experience!!!!",

    "text": "Don't yinz native Picksburghers hate me nah, but I have to admit that I didn't find Peppi's that impressive.  I'm from DE, where we have Capriotti's (can you say fresh turkey and all the fixins on a bun?!?) and are near Philly (a sub mecca), so I have high standards for subs.  Also, I pride myself on being an exacting--yet fair--reviewer.  In light of these facts, I'm afraid that Peppi's failed to deliver the sub nirvana I was hoping for.  I visited on Sat. for lunch with a friend while cycling.  Our original plan was to hit up the food trucks at South Side Works, but she was tired due to some grueling rowing practices the previous couple days, so the North Shore is as far as we made it.  She suggested Peppi's, and I agreed, given that I'd heard good things and that I hadn't been yet.  Since I don't eat beef, I was limited to two options: the amazing Sigfried or the turkey supreme.  Both were very similar, consisting of their respective meats plus grilled mushrooms and onions and LT.  I opted for the turkey, probably because I'm so used to the turkey awesomeness on a bun that Capriotti's delivers.  My friend ordered the roast beef, and both of us had drinks.  Although my friend told me the fries were good, we decided to forego them because we thought it'd be too much.  When I bit into my sub, I was underwhelmed by the amount and quality of meat, which was a thin layer of deli-style turkey slices.  To me, the sub seemed to be more then 50% veggies, most of which was lettuce.  I also found the bun too light for my taste, since I'm used to thick, bready buns.  While the taste was decent, it didn't blow me away, and texture-wise, it wasn't super-interesting, given its composition.  While you get a lot of sub for your money and it's better than Subway, if Peppi's is the best PGH has to offer sub-wise, they have a ways to go.  At least Primanti's has a unique product!  I know yinz'll hate me for saying this, but perhaps you should go to Philly--or even DE--for some sub-inspiration, n'at.",

Read the menu on the counter because the chalkboard is confusing; even the staff said so!   You order at the counter and they delivered to your table.  It did take a little longer than we expected but not to long.  Enjoyed looking at all the photos while we were waiting.   Ordered the Franco, an Italian with a little extra salami.  Probably did not need the extra but the sub was very tasty and to large to finish, so I have lunch for today too.  While not the best Italian sub/hoagie that I have had, it was very good and better than most sub shops that have popped up everywhere. The staff was super friendly and thought busy did stop by our table.  If you are in the area and looking for a pretty good sub or sandwich, Peppi's is a good stop.",

    "text": "SETTING: Seems like a lot of Pittsburgh sub/sandwich/hoagie places have a similar ambiance. Peppi's is no different, but it separates itself from the rest with its SUB-stantial flavors. Wooden benches/booths and walls adorned with photos of interesting characters. Laid back place to grab a quick bite.  FOOD: First time here, so I decided to go with their most famous sub: \"The 7\". The description wasn't kidding when they called this sub a juggernaut. Loaded with ground sausage, egg, american cheese, tomatoes, lettuce, and mayo, the \"7\"--aka the \"Roethliburger\"--delivered the perfect pass. A tight spiral down the chute and into my stomach. Touchdown, baby! It's THAT good, not to mention filling. Ain't nobody got time for SUB-par hoagie pokey.  The fresh cut fries are pretty solid too. Don't be fooled, the small size is plenty big. If you're here with another person, I would recommend sharing one sub and small fries. Yes, the fries are a bit greasy, but let's be honest...you're not here because you care about eating something \"delicious and nutritious,\" you're here because you want to devour a monstrous sandwich and have fries with that!   SERVICE: Order up front and you get a number that you put on your table. Seat yourself. In 10 minutes or so, your sub will be brought to you, and it will SUB-consciously change your life. Friendly staff all around.   IMPRESSION: I'd definitely come back again to try their other subs. Gotta be in the right mindset though. This is for sure a heavy duty lunch. As of now, my sub/hoagie ranking is as follows:  1. Peppi's 2. Uncle Sam's 3. Primanti Brothers   How many more SUB-liminal messages and hints do you need? Go get yourself a sub at Peppi's!",

Peppi's isn't just a spot for lunch. It's a storybook opened to the meat of the climax of one incredible story. To say they have \"history\" would be a disservice. These guys wrote the book from what I can glean from the pictures sports memorabilia. I had the pleasure of visiting while in Pittsburgh this summer and was thrilled with the product and especially the service.   I had a group of kids with me, so I made sure they didn't have to do too much talking for these fast-paced guys. We ordered a bunch of fries, drinks, and a mixtures of mains. Some of the kiddos decided to go for comforts (i.e. chicken fingers. Lame) but a few of us went for some menu titans. Namely, The Big Wheeler. Holy cow. Quite literally. Steak and sausage with provolone. Pretty unreal. It was a massive sandwich, too. All of the flavors melded together were like the Blues ancients, all of the Steelers and Pirates players, and all of the Ohio riverboat captains together were giving me high-fives. It just felt right. Meaty, greasy, melty, packed with flavor, and delightfully heavy. I felt like more of a complete human after having this sandwich.   Though we were all famished from the seemingly manual labor we were doing, I could only make it through half of it in one sitting.   Also, the owner and all of the folks on the line were incredibly nice. They had grace with our group and made us feel incredibly welcome.   Pro Tip: Make sure you have cash for this location. They have an ATM in-house, but it'll speed things up if you have your own when you walk in.   If I'm ever in Pittsburgh again, Peppi's will be a definite visit. Rock on.",

I told my friend I was excited to be coming up on Pittsburgh, somewhere I've never been before. I asked her what I should eat! She then recommended this place.  My first experience with them was awesome. My friend had already talked to them so they were expecting me (and knew about my long journey). Super friendly on the phone, ordered a cheesesteak. When I arrived, they had put up a welcome note (which I didn't see at first and passed like a million times! Hah) which totally made my entire week. They were so nice even with me being in my frazzled state! The people who work here... SERIOUSLY AWESOME.  And now the food... So bomb! I scarfed it down so hard. I WISH I lived here so I could continue to eat at this awesome place... But since I can't, you can eat here for me! Totally recommend this place to anyone who wants good food and awesome people.",

Best in town!) because it's definitely one of the best places to get one around here. The fries are absolutely delicious & they give you pretty decently sized portions. It's a cash only place, which is one thing that heavily annoys me about the place. There's no reason in this day & age to only use cash, it's stupid. The staff is always awesome & I've never had an issue where I've had to complain about anything! It's just a good place to get some great food. Im not sure why people (usually not from here) say Primantis is the food you need to get in Pittsburgh because I never liked it. Any Pittsburgh native knows that Peppis is the place you go for some authentic Pittsburgh cuisine! I would definitely recommend!",

The atmosphere is very casual and it's a good lunch spot.  The staff is quick and friendly. It's an order at the counter and then wait for your food to be brought out kind of place. They also take call ahead orders which is nice because it can take a few minutes to get your food as everything is made when you order. I've only ever been for lunch and it's always a bit crowded but I've never had an issue getting a table.  Only downsides are that it is cash only and street parking only. While I have not been to their other locations I would 100% recommend giving this place a try.",

The sandwiches are delicious. I would have to say it's much better than the sandwich chain, which I refuse to name, that most people traveling to Pittsburgh head to.

    "text": "Visiting Pittsburgh last weekend, this is the first place I had to try. Mainly because of The 7 aka \"The Roethlisburger\". I may not live in Pittsburgh or anywhere near it, but being a Steelers fan, Pittsburgh is definitely a part of me.   Walking in this place, you're greeted by at least 4-5 employees while you check out the big board/menu. When you're ready to order, you order, take a seat, and they bring out your food not long after. I ordered The Roethlisburger along with an order of Onion Rings. The sandwich came with american cheese, sausage/burger, and egg as the primary ingredients. I told them to put everything on it so it came with tomatoes, lettuce, and I believe a few other things.   I wish we had sandwiches like this in Louisville. From the bread all the way down to the smallest ingredient... the sandwich radiated freshness. The onion rings were fresh as well. Definitely the type of onion rings that have started disappearing over the years... the kind you bite into and with the bite you sometimes pull the onion out with your bite.  I could easily make this place a regular stop if I lived in the area. My only complaint & I won't take off a star is they only take cash. Luckily they have an ATM inside, but keep in mind that it's cash only. I understand why businesses do this, but if I was going to open a business... I'd take card, cash, bitcoin, whatever payment that someone wanted to give me.   Since I don't live in the area, I can't become a regular, but I will make it a point to visit everytime I'm in Pittsburgh.",

I remember visiting the strip district location often many years ago.   I stopped in and ordered a steak hoagie.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  Cash only - no credit cards.  There is an ATM in the restaurant just in case you don have any cash handy.   I was surprised at the very little meat on my hoagie especially by the price $6.75.  I might just order double meat next time.   Another surprise was that there is a burger called \"#7 Roethlis Burger\" which I love the idea although I have never had .. but ketchup brand offered is not \"Heinz\" brand.   I love the menu .. so many different types of sandwiches, salads etc. there is something for everyone.     These were just observances.. my steak hoagie was good and satisfied with the great customer service.    I just visited recently during lunch time at Noon.  As soon as I got there I regretted it but soon realized \"it was all good\".  The staff was so cool and calm and on the ball.. it was a zoo and the line was out the door.",

I love the Peppi's on Western Ave. It's one of their original locations, and the shop has great atmosphere on a cool little street in the North Side.   The service was fast and friendly, and you can't go wrong with most of their sandwiches there though I'm partial to the hot Italian.   Parking was pretty easy too in the middle of the afternoon. I'd pick Peppi's over the Subway or the McDonalds in the same area hands down.",

My boyfriend ordered the special steak with banana rings, cherry peppers, fried onions, lettuce and tomato. I ordered fries and the cheese steak with grilled onions, hot pepper rings, lettuce and tomato. LOVED IT.  The bread was the perfect ratio and texture, the cheese wasn't overwhelming, the steak tender, and the peppers gave it a tiny kick. I also put fries in my sub, it added a new texture and captured the saltiness of the peppers.   Downtown Pittsburg locals are warmer than Peppi's fresh cut fries. I will definitely be back.",

I myself ordered the New Yorkers which had steak, cheese, bacon, grilled onions, and lettuce. It seemed basic but the taste of the sandwich was phenomenal. The portion was huge and I also ordered the fries which were fresh and even though they were a little greasy they were great with the sandwich. All of my other friends ordered different sandwiches and everyone devoured their food. There was a moment of silence when we were all eating/enjoying our food so there was minimal talk at our table (lol)   I am seriously considering another roadtrip to New York next year so I can drive through Pittsburgh and stop there for another sandwich!! Def recommend this sandwich icon if you are ever in Pittsburgh area.",

It may have been because it was lunch time and the line was literally out the door, but, this is one of those places that you have to know what you are going to get the second you step in line. No time to look at the menu.  I might have missed a sign or two, but I did not know that they only take cash...so I had to step out of line to get money from the onsite ATM, which annoyed everyone - including me. The waitress cleaning tables was a bit snippy as well. Again, I am not going to write the place off - the food was good. Maybe next time the experience will be a bit better.",

    "text": "Everyone in town raves about Primanti's. However, this has to be my more favorite place to stop while in Pittsburgh. They have an awesome menu (cash only) but you cannot leave and not get the Roethli\"burger\". Delicous. Yum. Heck to the yes. I love the small kitchen style atmosphere, and they love it when you tip. I mean, they go nuts when you do (ala Cold Stone singing style nuts). Great people, even better food. Come hungry!",

    "text": "About a half dozen of us ordered subs from Peppi's on the North Side. And we were all pleased. The bread is VERY good. Thick, chewy, crusty...bread's so good here in Pittsburgh. Most of us got steak hoagies and there was plenty of meat on them.  I personally got the capicola and cheese. I got it with extra onions and hot peppers and, unfortunately, they skimped on the hot peppers. The capicola wasn't hot, either. Still, it was a very good sandwich. They did not skimp on the meat. The dressing was very tasty...I could taste lots of basil and oregano. Everything was very fresh...crisp veggies.  They have a nice sized menu consisting of mostly hoagies. But there are burgers and salads, as well. I've heard that the North Side store is better than the one in the Strip, and I liked their hoagie enough to check and see. I'd recommend this place, especially to people working on the North Side.",

I would give five stars but, their delivery guys is always slow and by the time the food gets to me it's semi warm. They have really good fries too!",

    "text": "I have been eating at Peppi's on the Northside for over twenty years and it never gets old.  The only problem is sometimes they are so busy you have to wait a while, but I've learned to call ahead and pick it up.  My favorite is the Whiz - an extra large cheese steak with sauteed mushrooms on it.  Their fresh cut fries are awesome (but eat them there - they don't travel as well as the frozen, processed fries from other restaurants).  I also love the Italian Special which I have them add crushed cherry peppers to.  It's also good hot, where they throw it on the grill for a minute or two to heat it up.  In the warmer months they have an outside patio in the back of the building which is pretty cool.  It has an artsy vibe to it and it is a great place to relax on a sunny day.  Go there a few times and the owners, Jeff & Kim, and their staff will get to know you and make you feel welcome.  Chuck always makes me feel at home and John always has something funny to share.  Be sure to feed the meter sufficiently before you feed yourself or your parking ticket might be the most expensive part of the trip to Peppi's!",

So we were both hungry and Peppi's was on the way and the atmosphere was awesome and fun.  While waiting for our food, an employee there also recommended us to check out RandyLand, which is also down the street.  Great Food and Great people!  Thanks Guys!",

Tasty sandwiches packed with the goods, walls lined up with local fanfare, and burly dudes who look like they know a thing or two about sandwiches are what make Peppi's unique.  Parking is on street but otherwise this place gets no complaints from me.  Peppi's is what Quizno's wishes it could be.",
