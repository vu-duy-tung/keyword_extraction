I wanted to post a picture of my eggplant & feta sandwich, but I scarfed it down too quickly. It was SO good. While the sandwiches are awesome, the hummus is really what makes this place. The little fridges inside are chock full of baba ganoush, salads, drinks, and more types of hummus than you knew existed. They have a combo for a sandwich & 8 oz tub of hummus for $8, which I thought was a great deal.",

All their hummus is made in-house (yes apparently there's a difference between something made in-house and something that's housemade; housemade can be made in someone else's house).  They have their hummus out for you to try before you buy it.  Apparently they also are one of the sources of hummus for Whole Food's, as they were out of their smoked white bean hummus the last time I went (its absolutely delicious and the smokiness reminds me of a summertime cookout).  Most of their pastries are made in-house; their meat, cheese, and spinach pies are shipped in though.  They also have other things like pastas and olive oils and what not, but I'm always drooling over their prepared foods to notice anything else.",

A young man was taking orders and making them. I felt bad for the guy. Yia Yia was bustling around the tight spaces, making sure everyone was content. I had to wait a while for my sandwich, but oh man...the wait was worth it. My gyro was piled high with lamb, a fresh spring mix, onions, and a very nice tzatziki sauce, no tomato! For only $5.

The meat appears to be baked, sliced and grilled as opposed to spit-roasted and shaved, so the consistency is closer to meatloaf. Although I prefer the spit-roasted variety, the flavor is still very good. The rest of the sandwich was okay. Good pita, but the greens were basically a bunch of spring mix (tasted too strongly of beet) with too much tzatziki. The whole thing was sort of hastily assembled and didn't physically hold up. That would be okay if we didn't wait so long for the thing.  Even before the lunch hour, our wait was very long. There was a single person working here and it showed. They were out of stock on sodas and it took about five minutes before they even knew we were there. The space itself needs repair: broken floor tile, damaged veneer, a mopping. I hate to bag on a small family-run business like this, but that stuff has to be taken care of and the service needs to be faster. I would pay more for that.",

You don't have to get the standard Gyro-any of their Gyro sandos are only $5-which is a steal if you are in a pinch for dinner or lunch. Also-they are DELICIOUS! In addition to yummy gyros and friendly service they have a variety of hummus choices. MMMMM.  If you are a lover of hummus like me you will super like this. The hub's favorite was honey habanero, my personal fave was spinach and feta hummus-but the gal at the counter let us know they come out with seasonal treats and will soon be having a sweet potato hummus- I'd try it :)  The only down side to this place is there is only a small seating area (like one bar with two stools) so get it to go an enjoy it in one of Pitt's fabulous parks or come with a small party!",

Also I really love family run businesses. My boy friend said he wasn't sure he likes Greek food. Grandma looked at him like he was stupid and told him to go wait outside.

    "text": "Let me start by saying I have had mostly great experiences with the Greek Gourmet. Their hummus is phenomenal. So is their Gyro. Great value. Their falafel sandwich is also great. My favorite hummus is the smoked white bean- FANTASTIC!!  Unfortunately I was prompted to write this review after a sub-par experience this afternoon. I went with a friend- I ordered a gyro and she ordered falafel with no onions.  My gyro came out and it was delicious as usual. I did have to go outside to get a paper towel, as the towel dispensers on the inside tables and counter were all empty. I finished eating my gyro and the falafel still hadn't come out. Eventually the young man working apologized for having forgotten the falafel- it burnt and he had to make another batch.  After a while the falafel came out. At this point my friend and I were eager to finish up and leave, so when she noticed there were onions she opted to just pick them off. Upon further inspection, this batch of falafel was very undercooked. Still not bad, she continued eating. Getting to the last bite, my friend noticed a dead fly on the lettuce hanging out of her sandwich. We got up to pay and my friend intended to mention the fly. A line formed behind us while we waited at the counter to pay, as the man cut gyro meat and the woman took inventory of hummus. The young man put his knife down, licked his fingers, and took my money. My friend did not want to mention the fly in front of the other customers. When I tried to subtly get the attention of the older woman she seemed distracted, so we finished paying and walked out.  I don't like reading reviews like this- highlight reels of disappointment- nor do I enjoy writing them. But my hope is that someone from GG will see the review and take it into consideration. Your employees should take pride in serving such great food, and this means paying attention. I did not feel like anyone was paying attention to quality, cleanliness, and customer satisfaction today. The paper towels, the burnt falafel, the undercooked falafel, the onions, the fly, the finger licking and not once were we asked how everything was.  Again, I love this place and I hate to write a frustrated review. But today's visit was a major disappointment. If this was a normal experience, I am quite sure The Greek Gourmet would not exist. I'd hate to see you go. So please, for the love of hummus, keep it clean and stay gourmet!",

I had a feeling when they were in the bag cause they were so heavy when I carried them to my car ( I was thinking these don't even feel cooked the whole way ..) .. they just tried to rush them because they forgot them and didn't let them cook ... so we had to cook in our air fryer when we got home . Only reason I gave 3 stars is because everyone was nice there ... so maybe their gyro meat is the thing to get there but I would never ever order chicken from there again ... and if I did order fries again hopefully they will be cooked ( if they don't forget them ) .. very disappointed ..THEY REALLY NEED TO DISCLOSE THIS IS BREADED CHICKEN ON THE MENU .",

Easily the best gyros I've ever had, definitely the best in the burgh.  Gyros were overflowing full. Meat was thick, and not at all reminiscent of the many \"steakum\" esque gyros I've had before, and there was a lot of it. Lettuce was fresh greens and NOT iceburg. Pita was soft and durable without being chewy. tzatziki sauce was GREAT. Garlicky, refreshing, awesome.  The baklava was soft with a crisp layer on top, the nuts inside had softened a bit. It was sweet but not overpoweringly so. I went to school for pastry arts so I am CRITICAL of baked goods. And this excelled in every way.  Will definitely be going again. Next time to the actual store to see what it has to offer!",

    "text": "I stopped by today around 12:30 to grab a gyro for a quick on-the-go lunch.  I asked if they had chicken gyros, to which the guy behind the counter said, \"Yeah, I can make you one.\"  Nonplussed, I said okay, and he rung me up for $5.  After standing around for a couple of minutes, I saw the guy who waited on me get a hunk of meat out, unwrap it, and put it on the broiler.  Noticing that the bus that I needed to catch would be there in 3 min., I asked him if my chicken gyro would be ready soon.  He assured me that it would, and then proceeded to assemble it and put it on a panini press.  When he gave me the finished product, I rushed out the door and managed to catch the bus just in time.  Once on the bus, I unwrapped the gyro and proceeded to eat it.  Upon inspection, it was large in size and bulky, and contained some surprising ingredients.  Instead of iceberg or romaine lettuce leaves, it was topped with spring mix, and I didn't detect any tomatoes in it at all--or fries.  The biggest surprise was the meat, however, which consisted of breaded chicken strips, most likely of the previously frozen variety.  This is the first time I've ever bitten into a gyro with crunchy (crispy?) meat.  The gyro also contained a generous helping of tzatziki sauce, which was applied between the meat and the spring mix.  Unfortunately, it lacked the zip that's the hallmark of a well-made tzatziki, and its plentifulness made for messy eating, esp. without napkins, which I forgot to grab when beating a hasty exit to catch the bus.  Overall, the flavor wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't what I'm accustomed to in a gyro.  I'd be willing to give this place another try for the hummus, since that's what everyone seems to rave about here, or perhaps a pastry, since their selection looked good.  For gyros, however, I'd recommend checking to see if the broiler is in use before ordering--at least, for the chicken variety, if you don't want to risk getting a gyro made with crispy chicken strips.  For a solid chicken gyro containing standard ingredients and meat sliced from the spit, I recommend Lesvos in the South Side.  Based on the positive reviews, I must confess that I expected better.",

We expected so much from it after the DELICIOUS food we just had. To our surprise, the chicken gyro contained  breaded chicken and spring mix. I don't know if all their chicken gyros are like that or we got that because they were out of chicken or may be just thought we would have no idea.

And the hummus?! Holy cow! I can't even begin to pick a favorite kind. Honey habanero? Buffalo? Cilantro jalapeno?? Last time I went, they were 3 for $10. That's a price that can't be beat, either! (The same homemade hummus from this place are sold in other stores in the area but are more expensive with a smaller variety).  You can buy ingredients and other stuff in the store, but I never have. There is only a small table or two inside the restaurant, so plan on taking your tasty lunch/dinner to-go.  The people who work there are incredibly nice. I heard somewhere that they do catering as well, but I'm not sure if that is True.  A gem in Squirrel Hill! Highly highly highly recommended. I recently moved away from Pittsburgh, but if I'm ever back, I'll be stopping here for sure.",

Apparently with over 20 kinds of hummus, you can please them all.  I tried a plethora of different ones but loved the buffalo, garlic and horseradish one the best.  I went home with the horseradish and have been happily eating it every day since.  Man does that horsey sauce give you a kick in the butt, but it's goooood!  I also had a gyro with all the fixin's.  The pita bread, soft and chewy.  The lamb, loads of it and nice and moist, no dry meat here!  The sauce (maybe to me one of the most important parts) was awesome!  Love me some cucumber yogurt greek sauce... load me up with it and I'm good to go!  Plus, it's cheap cheap cheap, with gyro's at around $5 and the hummus being around $3.  You won't break the bank with this lunch/dinner/snack!  It's a family run business and the owner is SUPER friendly and easy to talk to.  it's so awesome to see an owner that's so passionate about the business and happy to be there.    I know I'll be back for my stock of hummus, I'm hooked and I can't turn back now!!",

After this moment I knew I'd be coming back to this place.  Things I like: -various imported items like rose water, different olive oils, flours -great selection of hummus and appetizers in their refrigerators -I really enjoyed their two different kinds of gyros. They're both packed, are heavy enough to suffice as ad hoc dumb bells for bicep curls (a perfect exercise right before a feast), and the tzatziki sauce is rich, substantial, well-seasoned. -the lamb is very tender and also well-seasoned. However, I can't help but wonder whether the meat is really lamb or something more processed. Perhaps it's the texture of the lamb...  Things I didn't like: -small seating area -for the chicken gyro, it is a breaded chicken breast that tastes more like something that was taken from the freezer section of a grocery store. Regardless, it was still tender, well seasoned and the gyro overall was very tasty!  Together, I believe for the price this is a solid place to get incredibly delicious gyros, chicken or lamb.",

The sandwiches are also really hearty and are good for at least 2 meals. Although I appreciate that their meat is never dry because they cut the meat into thick slices, one of my favorite things about gyros is the crispy burnt ends the thin meat shavings often have which is lacking here. Otherwise, all the components are fresh, flavorful, and tasty.   This family owned business is also super friendly and inviting and they really try their best to make sure everyone has a good experience. I recommend getting a stamp card and getting your gyro on here!",

It's in a hipstery area (Squirrel Hill) and is making working man's food (Gyro) so I figured it would be a misappropriation. Plus it's a couple of dollars more than you'll pay for a Gyro at the stellar likes of Mike & Tony's or Gali's, which until now have been my faves in town.  I was shocked to find that the Gyro at TGG might actually be my fave in Pitt. In a City filled with Gyros, several of them excellent, for me to say that one might be the best of all is quite a big deal, as far as Gyros go. Because I'm kind of a big deal. And George Bush may not have a clue who I am, but Al Gore may.  The woman making it is super friendly, and I wish it were busier in here. Not too much in the way of seating, but you won't care when you try this sensational Gyro. Next time I'm in Pitt, I'll have to try some more of her delicious deliciousness. The food, I mean.  You also need to try their Hummus. Because Hummus have been love. But it's over now. It's where the water flows. It's where the wind blows.  Now more revelations about my sex life.  I covered her in S'mores, our name for that is SMOREPLAY And when we're in Maryland we like to BALTIMOREPLAY She charges for her time so you could say this is WH**EPLAY But honestly I'd rather just go eat at GREEK GOURMET",

This may be a little hole in the wall, but the food pacts big flavor. I got the chicken gyro. One of the most tasty wraps I have had. Upon opening the package I must admit I was intimidated. It took me a solid minute to figure out how to eat it. The wrap was seriously huge.  I finally decided to eat some of the filling with a fork, then pick up the rest. The chicken breast was moist, while being both sweet and savoury.  The pita bread was soft and chewy. All the produce was fresh. While the wrap was dripping with sauce, it wasn't too much.   My husband enjoyed his traditional gyro. Everything was the same as mine, except his had lamb. My eldest son got a hummus wrap. As someone who loves hummus, the wrap was perfect for him.  This is really intended to be a grab and go establishment. Seating is extremely limited. There are only  two tables. Each table only has two chairs. Don't let this stop you. Grab some amazing Greek food, and let it bring some delicious-ness to your day.",

There was enough meat for 2 lunches for me. And for $8.5 a set, it's a great deal in the area.   Fries were on the softer side. It's not the crispy ones I was expecting. But perhaps the baked ones were a healthier option.   Hummus was good too. My wife thought it was too spicy, but I thought it was alright.   Not a big fan of Greek food, but I will stop by again if I wanted a gyro.",

There was too much of lettuce and onions and they were falling out. I felt there was too much onion, which gave the gyro a very oniony flavor. The gyro itself was not that big (I was expecting a huge one because one of the reviews said so). It's really easy on the pocket, so no issues in that front.   The seating is also not that great. There are only two tables, with two chairs each, not facing each other. My fiance and I found it a little awkward. We could see a lot of open space behind the counter, which could be easily used to increase the seating area.   Wouldn't really recommend, unless you're running low on funds and don't mind take out.",

The tzatziki is absolutely delicious. I don't know how he finished his gyro, it had so much meat in it. The salad fed me two meals, and I still had enough meat left over to make a sandwich. Only downside was that the restaurant was hot inside (and hot outside too of course), so we ended up getting our food to-go and found a shady place to eat it. The service from the employee manning the store was so-so.  Then last week we picked up a tub of smoked white bean hummus to eat with veggies for a party. It was life changing. We're officially fans! Can't wait to try the baklava.",

Squirrel hill is so great because it is full of one of a kind eateries, but this one impresses me more than most.   First, their food is so affordable and I really mean that. You can get a Chipotle sized gyro (+ way more meat) for $6. You can't beat that.  Secondly, they definitely have the best gyros I have ever had in Pittsburgh and arguably the best gyros I have had period. I get them with all of the fixings (spring mix, tomatoes, onion, cucumber sauce).   Lastly, they have really awesome baklava, only a dollar a piece! I love sweet, drippy, honey filled baklava. Man, do they do it right!!!   The only downside is they have essentially no seating and parking nearby can be a pain, but since my man lives a couple blocks away we just take it home.",

The prices are crazy reasonable, and the employees are super friendly.  My experience:  Lamb Gyro ($5)- The lamb meat and pita were spot on.  Diced tomatoes were great.  The tzatziki sauce was unique.  I was not a fan.  It was a very heavy and creamy sauce, almost like ranch dressing.  It also seemed to have a salty feta taste almost.  It was very unique.  Similar to Laura M, I found the spring mix off-putting and very messy.  I would have much preferred romaine.  A 2.5 star gyro.  I want to go back and try the gyro again with a slight variation.  The girl behind me ordered hers without sauce but with hummus.  I think this is the way to go.  So I would recommend trying a lamb gyro with tomatoes and hummus.  They also have a frequent gyro card, and if you buy 10, you get one free!  Small Red Pepper Hummus ($3.50)- Spectacular.  I will be coming back here to buy more hummus.  They had about ten flavors.  I also tried the plain hummus, and it was super delicious.  Some of the best hummus I have ever eaten.  The employees were exceptionally friendly and upbeat and really seemed to like working there.  This is a take out only place and more of a market than a restaurant.  They also accept credit cards!",

    "text": "Craving some Greek food, I ordered the gyro and jalapeno hummus for lunch through a food delivery app last week. The gyro was unexpectedly gigantic which was both good and bad. Good because you get a lot for what you pay for. (Half was enough to get me full.) Bad because they stuffed so much meat in there that I had to take out about 25% of it just so I could hold it in my hands and start eating. (Sorry no photos because I was too busy figuring out how to eat the gyro.) The meat was savory though! I also enjoyed the jalapeno hummus. I liked that it was just a bit spicy but not too overwhelming for hummus.",
