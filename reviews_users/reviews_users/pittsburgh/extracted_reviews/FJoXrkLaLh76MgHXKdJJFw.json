They have a very cute outdoor area in the back, with comfy chairs that have lollipops behind them! There are also large chalkboard walls, which can be quite entertaining after a few drinks. We didn't eat anything, but don't worry, we plan to this Thursday (I will report back then). I heard they have some pretty good buff chicken quesadillas! But I have to agree with everyone else, this place is quite corky, and a South Hills gem. The bartender did remember everyone's name, and was extremely friendly. Not the place to go to if you're looking to get wild though. They do a good job of keeping everyone in check.",

I've never had anything that I don't like...but there are things that I keep going back to.  Like the Cheezam (ham, cheese, relish, grilled all golden and yummy)!  Burgers are always a great choice (the Rodeo burger is my favorite), as is the Sloppy Joe (sloppy and yummy goodness).  Just a side of fries, with cheese, bacon and sour cream...oh my.  ABSOLUTELY try the soup - whatever soup it is (if you see the Loaded Baked Potato, Cowboy Stew or Stuffed Pepper soups....get one.  Get all.  Take some home!!!). Great place!",

Clean restrooms with an array of scented soaps; kids will want to wash their hands before eating just to sample the soaps.  Good service and friendly atmosphere.  Although the menu is typical bar food, it is better than average.  A nice local restaurant that is consistently good.  Seating is limited and there is no waiting area so going during busy times can be a little frustrating.",

Got condescended by the bartender as she asked me \"do you see the clientele that comes here?\" Overall it looks like a dive bar to me and then the disrespect from a bartender. I'm paying clientele as everyone else. Then when asking to speak with a manager she clearly told me I should just leave. Will never recommend and overall service was ridiculous.

    "text": "I have to say that I am very, very pleased to have \"found\" this place in the South Hills. I discovered it when I was grabbing lunch next door at the Kabob G Grill and thought that I have to stop in and check it out after researching via Yelp and the business' website.  I came into this place around 7:30 on a cold and blustery Saturday night . Upon entering I felt like I had entered a jolly old pub one might see in a movie and think I wish I could find something like that. This place was warm and welcoming from the decor, staff, and patrons.   The special lady and sat at the bar and had a beverage each, I have to admit I'm not sure how much the beers we had were but we had three for a total of $18. While I like Great Lakes beers and the wife had a macrobrew, I still think that an avg.of $6 a beer was a little steep but not ridiculous. They did have a very general variety on draft, but unfortunately no hoppier beers for us hopheads.   We tried some ginger sesame wings or something along those line they were solid, and the fish sandwich was enormous and tasty. You can order this piece of ?? Haddock or cod??? you know one of those typical hunks of fish grilled or fried, we decided to get it fried and it was done perfectly, the fish was hot and flaky, and the breading nice and crispy.   My lady really enjoyed the assortment of scented soaps in the bathrooms and I just felt like I was at home thinking to myself why the heck do my hands smell like spiced -vanilla- hoisin berry- fruitcake. I would recommend splitting the fish because it is huge. I will certainly be coming back here for the food and atmosphere and maybe a beverage. Oh and ample free parking is a major plus.",

The food is always on par. I have never had a meal that I didn't enjoy. Their wing flavors are amazing and their burgers are to die for.  Perfect size restaurant and bar, we are so very  lucky to have this gem in the South Hills.",

Homemade chips were dark and very hard. When we mentioned it we were told the whole batch is that way- definitely not made to order. Then the owner was talking about it passive aggressively at the bar when the waitress went to her. Then her and two staff were commenting on a kitchen staff and attacking his personality. As a customer, I really want a friendly and welcoming atmosphere. The burger was good but the environment was not what I hope for and two burgers- no drinks- ended up being about $30. Good food for the most part but would not return. Seems like local regulars have their place and I did not belong.",

This immediately started chatter between the owner and bartender. It was obvious they were talking about us.   The owner knocked on the restroom door multiple times. The bartender made several comments to other patrons about how our friend should \"poop wherever he ate\". When my friend emerged from making fudge dragons the bartender said \"I hope you cleaned up after yourself\".   My friend was humiliated. I was embarrassed for the owner and bartender as they were prying, invasive, rude and childish. I've never had an experience like this anywhere else. I would endorse this place as having a decent beer selection but don't be surprised if they make you feel guilty for using the restroom.",

They are always packed, but must not have enough people working there to accommodate the crowd.  We took my father in law there a few months back for dinner while he was visiting.  On that visit we waited probably an hour to get our food.  Today my wife and I wanted a quick dinner on the way home from work.  I called and ordered 1 chicken salad (with no onion or mushroom) and 1 steak salad.  The lady told me it would be 25 to 30 minutes, which I thought was already pretty long for 2 to go salads but whatever. Got there with about 5 minutes to spare.  Paid for the food, and waited...and waited...finally after I sat at the bar for about 40 minutes (so it's now been an hour) my food came.  Got it home to find that the meat on the salads was cold, steak was over done a little, and my wife's chicken salad was covered in onions and mushrooms.  Sadly I don't think we'll be back.  Which is a shame because I really do like thileir food, and love supporting local businesses.  I only gave 2 stars because the food is pretty good usually.",

We had been going there regularly for about a year because the food is good and we decided to bring a group there for my husband's birthday.  The owner could not have been more rude about everything.  She seemed irritated that we came at all and any time we asked for another drink or a menu, she rolled her eyes and walked away grumbling.  That night ended horribly with her being rude, charging me for bringing my own cupcakes, and then yelling at us for playing with the balloons at the table.  There was barely anyone in the bar so we thought she would enjoy the business but she pretty much yelled at us for being there and shoved us out.  We vowed to never go back but...  One night we decided to get take out.  I walked in to pick it up and stood at the bar for a while waiting for someone to ask me what I needed an no one even glanced in my direction.  The bartender stood at the other end chatting away, the owner kept looking at me but continued to sit at the bar talking to the bartender.  She eventually got up, asked what I wanted, then made someone else get my food.  The good food can't save this place with the rude service.",

    "text": "I rarely give 1-star reviews, but after our experience at Someone Else's Bar last night, I honestly couldn't bring myself to bump it up to 2.  We decided to stop here as we were looking for a quick dinner prior to heading to Hundred Acres Manor on a Saturday evening.  We figured, good ratings, bar food, it couldn't take more than 1-1.5 hours...  wrong.  When we walked into the bar, we weren't sure what to think.  Without any waiting space, we were smashed up against the bar and waiting to figure out who was going to greet us at the \"Please wait to be seated sign\".  The bar/restaurant seemed busy (which we figured was a good sign) and we were eventually greeted by a server/hostess/manager that couldn't really give us an estimated wait time nor next steps.  After some confusion, she suggested we go wait outside on the back patio with a few beers, which we complied.  After about a half-hour of freezing outside (a separate family and us had fun joking about it being 55F and being asked to wait outside with no heaters) we were asked to come in and given a table by the bar.  To cut a long story short...  the service was horrible.  Granted, our server said it was only her third day, but was it really necessary to have to retake our drink orders three times?  We ordered what I thought would be quick fix food.  Two quesadillas and two fish sandwiches.  After about an hour wait, we pressed our server for our food and were told it was being placed \"in the window.\"  Half an hour later and another follow-up, we finally had our food.  Now...  had the restaurant still been busting at the seams, I would of had more sympathy.  But at this point, the restaurant was half-full and quite tepid to be honest.  While the quesadillas were good, my fish sandwich lacked any flavor and the sweet potato fries were greasy, mushy and bland.  When I asked to see the manager...  the hostess that originally greeted us came over and gave us nothing but attitude when we complained about the service, food time and being mislead about it \"being in the window\".  She mentioned that \"she was going to comp us a round of drinks but never got around to it\" and that she couldn't help that she had to be back in the kitchen.  With a little more prose and sympathy, I think I would of been willing to rate this higher and give it another shot on another date...  but that was the final stake in this Halloween terror.",

    "text": "Someone Else's Bar is the ultimate 'introductory' bar for someone who isn't a fan of loud, crowded, noisy bars (like me) - after you visit I'm not sure you'd want to even 'move up' to more expensive, bigger establishments. It's a welcoming, down-to-earth place with fantastic, affordable food.   My best friend lived in the apartment right next to SEB for about a year, and when I lived in the South Hills still, we'd go over probably two or three times a month. The waitresses knew us by name (we were known as \"the kids\" since the majority of customers here are my parents' age, maybe 35-50 year olds). It makes for a great audience, and a very personal feel. You will always get great, friendly service, whether you're at the bar, or at a table. I have eaten there plenty of times at both and have always felt like Someone Else's Bar was a second home. I've only had one experience here where the service at the bar was \"just okay.\"   As for the food, it's standard American fare - nothing groundbreaking - but always delicious. Portion sizes are generous, especially the Viking sandwich, which is a fried buffalo chicken breast about 12\" long on a gigantic bun. I'm not sure you can find a better, bigger, tastier sandwich in the South Hills. Burger night is a great choice since you can customize your burger with all sorts of toppings (cajun jerk seasoning, blue cheese, some things you don't see often on other menus). Just watch, though, since every additional topping costs more. You can rack up a $13 burger if you're not careful (but it'll be the size of your head so it's worth it).   The charm of Someone Else's Bar lies in the quirky details. There is a jar of candy on every table and scattered around the restaurant. They have all kinds of fun, seasonally-changing soaps in the bathrooms. There are fun accessories hanging on the walls, and the decor is pleasantly kitschy. It's just, plain and simple, a fun place to go. Bring your friends, because taking up a table for yourself isn't the best use of space. SEB gets crowded quickly, especially when a Pens/Steelers/Pirates game is on. This is about its only downfall. I wish they had more seating, though I do know they recently expanded with outdoor seating around back.   I miss living so close to Someone Else's Bar - but it's honestly worth crossing a few bridges and rivers to get there. Give it a shot.",

I walked in, alone because my boyfriend was on the phone outside...sat at a bar stool and was asked by the long grey haired bartender \"Are you ok?\"  \"Sure, thanks! I'm great... here for a drink, can I see a menu please?\"  Then she asked me \"have you been drinking\" I jokingly smiled at her and thought is this a serious question??? I believe the exact response I gave was \"excuse me?\"  Oh she was serious....She then proceeded to tell me, within a bar full of people, that \"they ask everyone this, and that she observed me stumbling in the front door\"   At this point she is now looking at my drivers license with a flashlight.... I sat there disgusted.  Talk about embarrassing!! I've never been treated this way in public in my entire life.   Ok, clearly not a regular here. I walked in the door, dressed up from a nice dinner and immediately received strange looks. I sat down, smiling and friendly... as always... and was totally put on blast in front of the entire bar. Am I not permitted to be here, am I not able to be my happy and enthusiastic self?   At this point she asked what I would like to order, but all I could think of was getting the heck out of this place and going somewhere that I wouldn't feel completely uncomfortable, and that's what I did.   Luckily, since I wasn't visibly intoxicated by any means, we were able to check out a surrounding bar... be a great patrons, leave a great tip, and manage to write this great yelp review the same night this all occurred so that everyone can know what an embarrassing experience I had at someone else's bar!",

    "text": "I'm not sure I understand the hype for this place.  Is the candy on the tables fun?  Sure.  But the rest was just average.  We ordered two drinks, the sangria which was way too sweet and the specialty drink made with ginger beer and Meyers rum.  Now I appreciate the effort to make something new and different, but I thought a dark and stormy made with Meyers rum was not going to be very good so I asked if they could use another dark rum instead.  Nope, no other dark rum available.  Really?  Fine, I tried the drink with Meyers rum, as expected, not very good.  The salad was just OK.  The chicken on it was cooked exactly right and was tender without being dry but it had no flavor.  None, zip, nada.  I'm thinking perhaps many people ordering this don't want salt so they aren't going to salt the chicken, but this had nothing on it.  There are lots of options for spice out there that don't have salt.  We also had a burger.  Same issue.  No spices on it at all.  So while it was cooked well and I could easily select my toppings, it was bland.  There were quite a few patrons in the over 60 crowd and perhaps they like bland food?  This place is very close to me so I might give it another try, but I'd stick to beer not mixed drinks and I'd probably get wings instead of a burger or salad.",

They have a great wing night where they focus on about 8 good sauces as apposed to 50 different sauces that are sub par. It had a great atmosphere and decor as well. Oh and free candy EVERYWHERE!",

    "text": "I had dinner here and a couple of drinks. I was really pleased, mainly for the friendly and comfortable atmosphere. This is a real nice neighborhood bar/restaurant that you can go to and feel right at home.   It's fairly small with a rectangular bar in the center as you enter. It looked like there was a separate dining area in the back, and there were some tables along the side of the bar.   I sat at the bar and there was a very friendly lady working behind the bar. They had a limited draft beer selection but one nice rotating draft, a Magic Hat IPA.   The menu is mainly sandwiches, burgers and wraps. I got their burger special for the day that allowed two free toppings. The list of toppings is pretty big, but I just got cheddar and an onion ring. There is a quarter and half pound size burger. I got the half pound for $9. It comes with home made chips. That's a pretty good price.   The bar stools were real comfortable and it was as a nice place to sit and relax. There were a couple of screens in the bar area that they switched to a Pirates game when it started.   Looking forward to coming here again!",

I'm not a fried food fan, but they were free, with a meal (see my tip for getting freebies here).  The quesadillas were okay, but  bland. Perfectly glden brown, they were filled with melted cheese and chunks of tender, white chicken. Chicken was a bit skimpy. Four wedges, with slightly spicy salsa, and sour cream, $9.  Bartender was cordial and very efficient.",
