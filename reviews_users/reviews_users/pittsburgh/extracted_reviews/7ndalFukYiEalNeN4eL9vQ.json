First, the service was significantly slow for not being that busy on a Sunday night. Second, there were multiple issues with the food. The prime rib was not cooked correctly as medium rare was assumed to be medium well done. My wife then ordered shrimp which was completely dry... (how do you mess up shrimp??) Quite personally, if you want to get a good experience, my recommendation is to take the time and drive up to the greensburg location. It is safe to say we will not being driving to the monroeville location anymore.",

The restaurant is divided into sections where a very young receptionist takes you to your booth or in our case made a mistake and had to relocate us.  When you walk in you are greeted by a overwhelmingly number of young employees who appear to be disorganized which I believed to cause the problem in the first place. This place is very casual as is the menu.  We had ordered a filet and a strip which both were over cooked and very small.  The food runner made a error in who got what as it was hard to determine the strip from the filet.  They wait staff also did not inform us that their baked potatoes are drenched in a salt mixture which was so over powering we could not eat them. The original waitress apologized to me as she stated i should  have told you  there was salt on them. My side of mushrooms were soggy as well. With our two glasses of wine and tip, it was around $75 and not worth it.",

We received our ticket numbers to our steaks. When we were seated we ordered our iced teas (no lemon) both came with lemon in them; okay no big deal take lemons out. Waitress took orders for our sides as our steaks were already picked out and asked if we wanted anything on our steaks. I replied yes I will take the mushrooms. Husband got his steak said it was perfect.  I got my sides but no steak yet and mine was to be medium rare (his was medium) I ate a roll, nibbled at some corn waiting for my steak. When steak came it had onions, mushrooms and I am not sure what else on it.... Not what I ordered.  Waitress apologized said it was her fault and would get another steak for me; by then the rest of my meal was ice cold.  SO not only did I not get to eat the steak I PICKED OUT ....... BUT bill was not reduced or free dessert or anything offered for their mistake even if I would have said do not worry about it , a good run restaurant offers to compensate for their mistakes.",

I assume it was an irate customers.  It turned out to be 2 employees arguing and using profanity in the back.  When I say arguing, I mean yelling to the point where it sounded like a fight was about to happen.  It slightly frightened my niece.  She was concerned and so was I.  My niece got out of her seat and sat beside me and said \"I'm ready to go!\"  This really saddens me that my niece had to experience this on her first trip to TX Roadhouse.  I didn't pay for her to come hear employees argue.  I would expect behavior like this from customers because the population of people change from day-to-day... BUT EMPLOYEES!  Why ruin your reputation like that... was it worth it?  Besides that altercation, my waiter was very pleasant and checked on us frequently.  My food came out warm... i prefer piping hot so i know it's cooked fresh but i was so tired I didn't feel like asking them to heat it up.  Despite that, the meat was very moist and tasty and the green beans and mash were good!  They lose a star due to lack of professionalism and warm food.  I'm sure my experience will be better next time!!",

However, he was served his steak a full 29 mins before my steak was delivered.   He was literally finished by the time my steak arrived.    Granted the young lady was in the weeds, but the inept manager did not send her any help after she came out to check on her.  I couldn't get her attention to even order another beer.  My steak came out over cooked.  And the manager did come out and asked me \"how was  everything?\"  I told her \"late\" she laughed and said they were very busy.

This is the firs time for me in the Pittsburgh area and specifically in Monroeville. This place opened not more than a month ago. In that time they have worked through most of the 'opening day' issues and troubles.  I used the 'call ahead seating' option and was seated within 5 minutes of arriving. That is good system management let's just say. We were seated in a booth in the bar area, which was just fine with us. Our server/waiter was very professional and cordial and prompt with his attention and service. We had three different stake selection all of which came out just a tad over done but very tasty nonetheless. The sides are 'kind-of' 'homestyle' but adequate accompaniment's to the main portion of the mean which is steak; which is why everybody is here.  The menu is quite varied and offer may choices from ribs, to burgers to many kinds of steaks. I think everybody could find something interesting to eat here. Everything is moderately priced and full of flavor.  Left well satiated and happy. We will be back for more.",

It was very chaotic and I wasn't fan of the demographic of people. It seemed that it was only older caucasians that came here and were looking at me at a very judging manor. Also, there is a long wait even if you call ahead so beware. I don't think I will come back.       On the otherhand, from what I ordered-the rattlesnake bites and brownie were very good. The rattlesnake bites doesn't actually have rattlesnake and they are basically fried cheese and jalapeno balls but the cheese is gooey and melts deliciously. The brownie is a hot brownie with ice cream and is very good. However, I got the pulled pork dinner for my main meal and to be frank, it was mediocre. I would recommend Pittsburgh Barbecue Company over Texas Roadhouse.",

    "text": "I've had mixed experiences at this location.  One time we went and were seated promptly, served efficiently and everything in our meal was delicious and correct.  Another time we were there our server clearly didn't want to be working, screwed up our order and took over 45 minutes to get our food.   One time it was just average.  Longer than expected wait times but food and refills were timely.  There would be a higher rating if the service and quality were more consistent.  I have just been surprised that we've had such varied experiences, especially since we are usually there around the same times (weeknight or weekend evenings). Overall, we enjoy the place.  There is a decent variety on the menu, a large seating area and tasty peanuts and bread/butter.  And when the food is prepared correctly, it is quite tasty.  But when they are off, they seem to be really off. The pros are that it is kid friendly for a variety of reasons (including how loud it is, so if you have a kid doing crazy things it isn't as noticeable as in quieter establishments).  Cons include unpredictable wait times for tables and food and service.   We'll probably only be back when organizations we support have fundraiser nights or when we get the free kids meal coupons.",

We were seated quickly and the server took our drink and food order quickly. It was a bit past 8 on a Sunday evening. The ribs came out without much delay. They had a \"cooked a good while ago and kept in a warmer\" look to them, but they tasted okay and pulled easily from the bone. Sides were okay, except for the steak fries I never got. Unfortunately there was a group of younger millenial types seated adjacent to us, one of whom was flamboyantly sure he was absolutely fascinating and everyone in the place should be treated to his often vulgar exploits and opinions. Neither the waitress nor management made any effort to restrain his offensive commentary or volume. In an already loud-ish venue, it just made for an unpleasant experience. Food - passable. Service - friendly but busy enough that attention to detail lost. Atmosphere - unmonitored. Overall...meh.",

    "text": "Went here today at 7:30 pm 12/14 to celebrate work accomplishments with the family with beverages and steaks and left disappointed.   Ordered 2 Porterhouses - I ordered one medium well with mushrooms and onions and my husband ordered the other medium.   The steak I thought was mine was delivered and it was a perfectly cooked medium well steak and a decent cut of meat.   However, My husband's steak which was supposed to be cooked medium and was delivered over cooked and much smaller than mine. He tried eating the side of the porterhouse less over cooked and appeared very unhappy with his food trying to force it down. I asked to try a piece and it was not as tasty as my own with a lot of fat and was over cooked and chewy. He tried my steak which I had just started eating and we assumed that they switched our steaks placing the mushrooms on the medium steak. We thought they mixed up the steaks.   I switched steaks with my hubby and dumped the mushrooms and onions on and I could not eat it. Especially since the other was cooked much better!It did not taste good at all and chewy. Very over cooked with a lot of fat!   I told the waitress and she understood the mixup and the dissatisfaction with the food and she took it back.   The manager came back and told us that someone In the back felt that we ate too much of the bad steak and that they would not replace it and would have to charge us to replace it since it looked like a bunch was eaten; which was not True - the steak was very small - however her solution proposed was to take the good much bigger steak cooked perfect steak and swap it and replace that one - which made no sense. And who knows what spit would have made it on our food so we declined. We left the bad steak on the table just the way you see on the picture.   We were not pleased and was dissatisfied that the manager had such a lack of care.   The waitress was awesome and sent many apologies - much more caring than the manager. She understood. We left her a tip for her services and are however, we are still disappointed with the porterhouse steak issue left unresolved thanks to the manager.   We will not be back to this restaurant and have the same bad taste in our mouths that we had with the nasty, tough and fatty porterhouse steak served to us.   Tip: taste your food and are displeased, stop eating it - don't settle if it is less than expected and return it for a refund right away. Don't waste your time. We work hard or our money and you deserve and expect quality food and a resolution if you report issues.   Experienced was ruined.   Spend the extra on Morton's and Capital Grill. This would never happen there. Save your pennies!",

I especially like the fried catfish filets, which are well seasoned and crunchy. The ribs have a nice sweet sauce and fall off the bone texture. The house salad is more than just lettuce and tomatoes! The hotdog from the kids menu is huge. This is the place to go if you're hungry or want dinner and leftovers for the next day! Prices are reasonable considering the quantity and flavors. Hope they never change this formula because it works and the crowd will continue to rally hear for chow!",

    "text": "We came here for a post-Christmas family dinner after some shopping at the mall. This restaurant has been open for about 3 weeks now; we normally go to the one in Greensburg. The wait time provided to us was pretty accurate. We were told 25 minutes, and we were seated within 30 minutes. The waiting area could be a little bigger as I'm pretty sure the Greensburg one is.   Naturally, we ordered the Cactus Blossom, and it was amazing. Crunchy battered-covered onions with zesty horseradish sauce! We saw other tables order the potato skins which looked super tasty as well. While the rolls and honey butter were good, we could've used more butter but we made it work. My sister ordered a strawberry margarita ($9.25) that I finished off, and it was fantastic! I ordered the steak and shrimp combo ($17.99). The shrimp was so full of flavor and spice. However, I asked for my steak well done and it still had pink inside. I was too full to eat it anyway so I packed it up to further cook at home.   Our waitress was very friendly and on top of things. Before my dad even finished his strawberry lemonade, she brought out another. Well worth the $2.99! I must admit that I was disheartened when our waitress mentioned that they could not take lunch breaks or eat at the restaurant during their shifts due to the busyness. I'm a firm believer in taking care of your employees.   Other than the couple things that I mentioned, we enjoyed our meal at the new Texas Roadhouse in Monroeville.",

We walked out and asked to speak with the manager. When we explained what we had experienced, her reply was sorry I didn't know. That was it.

I had a lovely N.Y. strip that was done perfectly.   And the server waited until I cut into it before leaving. I love that idea. If it would've been wrong, no waiting for me. Also, if I would've gobbled it down and THEN claimed it was wrong, no food payment scene after the fact for them.   It was a busy afternoon at a busy chain on a busy holiday weekend.

I don't even eat steak but I enjoy their grilled shrimp or even their chicken fingers. The staff here were awesome even when they unfortunately ran out of bread. I recovered though when they gave us some on the way out. The cocktails are colorful and if you go for wine don't play yourself and go for the Texas pour because why not? I haven't met a Texas Roadhouse I didn't like and they're consistent I will give them that.",

    "text": "As a Texan spending a month in Pennsylvania I was sure glad to see Texas Roadhose Restaurants here. Came in about 3:00 pm today and we were seated immediately. Our awesome server Jayla was with us pretty quickly and was very patient with my husband who has aphasia. There was a small mix up on my salad but it was easily and quickly fixed. Our steaks (11 oz. sirloins) were nice cuts and cooked perfectly. The only \"problem\" I have as a Texan is that they do not have Dr. Pepper, a Texas made soft drink.",

    "text": "This bone in ribeye steak was fire! I don't eat steak often, but when I do it has to be right. For the few times I have gone to any Texas Roadhouse I have never been let down. The staff and the cooks get an A+ in my book.  The portions and seasoning of the food is on point. Then to top it off the adult beverages is on the money. I always eat good, but have yet to get dessert. Because by the time I finish my meal I am stuffed . So if you ever want to treat yourself to a good meal or gather you friends up to enjoy a good meal, music and drinks this is your go to! The only thing you will regret is not being able to order desert because your so full!!",
