I order their Tom Kha Noodle soup with beef with a level 8 out of 10 spiciness. The beef was pretty bland and had almost no heat. The soup part was slightly tastier, but still bland and not spicy at all. My girlfriend ordered the Thai style fried rice with chicken and she was not impressed with it...had to use soy sauce. The Thai iced tea was very good. Finally, the pumpkin custard with sweet sticky rice was ok. I'd give the Thai cottage another try, but it would have to be an eat in experience though it will be hard to do that with the Square Cafe down not too far down the block.",

I'm not much of a fan of tofu, but their sunrise tofu will even make the most carnivores person happy. The fresh roles are also amazing as are their curry dishes (pumpkin curry is at the top of my list). The atmosphere is as good as the food and the byob option is nice.",

    "text": "I'm in love with this place. Not only is it a free-corkage BYOB joint, but the food is excellent. I had a ginger pork dish a generous helping of perfectly sticky rice to sop up the sauce. My only complaint would be that it wasn't as spicy as I was expecting -- I asked for a \"medium\" and got American Midwestern medium, not Thai medium.   There were also some pleasant food surprises, like the mini-samosas that were about the size and shape of a piece of Thai toast, and the delicious little dumplings (both of which came from the appetizer platter I shared with my wife).  My favorite part of the experience, though, was the service. We had one shy, kind of demure server who got us water and opened the wine we brought, but the server during the meal? Very cheeky and humorous, while also taking excellent care of us. I hope to get the same server again when I most definitely return.  I'd put this place head-to-head with any of the super-good Thai joints in Los Angeles, without a doubt.  (Also, the pumpkin custard dessert is freaking delicious. I couldn't finish it, but man! The flavor combination of pumpkin, sweet custard, and the coconut in the rice base was splendid.)",

    "text": "Some of you may have noticed, the Green Mango packed up and moved out of its Regent Square location. If you didn't notice that the space has become Thai Cottage you could be forgiven, since not much has changed, save some of the art on the walls.   That is, until you open the menu.   I had grabbed a take out menu on a prior non-eating excursion down in the Square and had given it a good look-over. I was pretty sure by the time GFgf picked me up, that I was going for the pumpkin curry with tofu & veggies, of course. When we were seated, the hostess gave us special menus along with the standard. I noted a Tamarind tofu (fried tofu over steamed veggies in a tamarind sauce) and a Sunrise Tofu (same with a peanut chili sauce).   We asked the waitress about gluten free options, but ended up speaking with a woman from the kitchen who might be the owner. She said all of the curries are GF. We asked if the fresh rolls were safe & she said she would double check the wrapper package to make sure there is no wheat in them. Turns out they were a go. When she served them, she brought us both a sweet and sour and a peanut sauce since the sauce they normally serve with them is not GF.   The rolls and the sauces were delicious!   Though swayed by the specials, I stuck with the pumpkin curry, as it was a chilly, dreary night. GFgf went with the Massaman with shrimp, and we both got brown rice.   GFgf's curry was loaded with shrimp & she gobbled them up with pleasure. The pumpkin in my dish was creamy and flavorful. The spice level (6) had heat without losing the complexity of the spices. There was a nice blend of other veggies and the tofu was cut into bite-size pieces and lightly fried so they blended in nicely to the dish (as opposed to those big chunks of flavorless fresh tofu so often dumped into Asian dishes).   Our initial foray indicates that Thai Cottage's predecessor will not be missed long. We'll definitely be back soon.",

When we walked out, we finally noticed that the sign was different. It seems that this is under new ownership.   The menu has changed drastically. Don't look for your old favorites, because they won't be there. There are still plenty of vegetarian options, but the two dishes we shared weren't as good as the ones we'd had when this was still The Green Mango. I ordered the Kang Paneng, which is veggies and tofu in a red curry/coconut sauce. It was not spectacular, but ok. My dining partner ordered the Rad Na--flat rice noodles and veggies in a \"special gravy.\" Again, not spectacular, but ok. Lunch comes with a soup (didn't try) or an unremarkable green salad. I'm sure we'll be back, because it's a great vegetarian lunch option nearby, but I will miss the Green Mango every time.",

    "text": "Thai Cottage would seem like a better restaurant if a great Thai restaurant hadn't just vacated that space in Regent Square. We stopped in for lunch yesterday, and while the food was solid and the service was good, it's a step down from the Green Mango, at the same price.  My Thai beef and sticky rice salad (a special) was advertised as being served on spring mix greens, but came out over romaine instead. Since we were at lunch, the server offered a choice of soup or salad to go with the meal - sadly, the salad was simply average, just romaine and a tomato that was very out of season. The two bright spots were the steamed dumplings (delicious) and my husband's curry - sweet, as curries often are in Pittsburgh, but still well done.  The service was fine and very polite, but our server seemed to have a cold(!).  Would I go back? Sure, but I might stick with the standard menu rather than the specials - my guess is that the kitchen does its best work in its comfort zone. And with time, any missteps (like the wrong lettuce or a missing knife, or staff with the sniffles) might work themselves out. But I am keenly aware that great Thai food is the same distance from me in the other direction at the Green Mango location in Monroeville.",

The hostess is the same hostess/server that used to work at Smiling Banana Leaf, and she is a dear. Always attentive and helpful, the service is very good.   I had the red curry and my friends had various entrees such as pad kee mao, green curry, and several salads. Everything looked and smelled delicious. The fresh rolls are delicious as well, and I love that there are other delicious Thai options in Pittsburgh other than my usual Smiling Banana Leaf, Nikki's, and Pusadee's Garden.  If you find yourself in Regent Square, definitely try Thai Cottage.",

The woman greeted us enthusiastically as we entered and was very attentive throughout our meal ( a nice change from some of the Green Mango-era staff).  I like the new look-- more neutral colors, a collection of pierced-metal ceiling fixtures gathered in the center of the room, a different seating arrangement (benches along one wall with comfy pillows).  The  music was also enjoyable, Madeleine Peyroux and Diana Krall held my attention until our food arrived, then I could focus on nothing else.  :)  I ordered Pad Kee Mow, wide rice noodles with napa cabbage and Thai basil in a garlicy sauce; my husband enjoyed his chicken and vell peppers in a Thai basil sauce with rice.  Both dishes were absolutely delicious.    We live a 45 minute drive away, but will be making excuses to visit the area more often, just to eat here.",

The Thai iced tea is really good, as are the bubble teas. I'm glad they have real bubble teas and not just bubble smoothies like Green Mango had.  I only wish they delivered!",

Service was good and our food came out quickly. I ordered the tamarind tofu--crisp fried tofu with peppers, onions, broccoli, carrots, and tamarind sauce over rice. The flavor was alright, although I feel the quality is tending toward that of the typical Chinese restaurants that cater to a non-Chinese clientele--lots of sauce to cover up all the other ingredients.  We brought out own wine, which is nice to be able to do.  I will be back with the hope that the restaurant starts to improve. Prices are a little high for the flavor and quality of the food. There are better Thai restaurants in town, including the standard against which I judge all others, Thai Gourmet in Bloomfield.",

Second try, they attempted to walk off without making change for the bill and gave the wrong food. We ended up with a veg appetizer instead of meat - it's got totally different items in it - and a pork entree instead of chicken. Not to mention my noodles (not soup) are drowning in extra sauce.   Now we're eating pathetic samosas & tofu instead of delicious dumplings and satay. It's not worth driving back to fix it.   Get your act together, Thai Cottage. I'll stick with Curry Away.",

Before you devour your favorite dish, peruse the appetizers. The obvious favs are the crispy spring rolls, chicken satay and samosas, but you can't go wrong with Cottage Combo I or II -- something for everybody! The curry options include seasonal variations, but ye olde standby order is usually the pineapple tofu, yellow, or massaman. The standard 1-10 \"how spicy?\" scale is nothing to be scared of, so go big or go home. If you got noodles on the brain, then the classic pad thai or see ew always hits the mark.",

The portions were satisfying enough and the food was definitely enjoyable.   What really discouraged me from coming again was the service, which was abysmal and completely soured the experience. The waiter actually forgot we were waiting to be served. We waited 40 minutes for a Thai Iced tea before he realized. I would have understood if the place was packed but there were literally only 3 other tables there. People who sat down after us who had ordered the same thing and more were served before us and left.   Once we actually got our food which was a little over AN HOUR later. We quickly ate and paid our check to salvage the rest of our night.   So if you want to spend 2 hours at a restaurant staring at other people eat while you quietly starve then I would go here.",

Yesterday, July 3...After a long walk with the puppy at Frick Park, we were planning on going  back to Oakland for bubble tea, and passed this place with their sign posted on the sidewalk said \"milk tea\" ...WIN!   After I parked the vehicle, I looked them up on Yelp, saw their menu and pics of their food...WIN! I gave them a call to see if they had outdoor seating because we had the dog, and...WINNN! We took a seat at the table, the AWESOMEST, super nice, friendly waitress came out with menus and water for us AND the dog...WIN! The food on the menu sounded so good, we make our choices, ordered our bubble milk teas. The waitress kept the cups full and the puppy water bowl full...we didn't want for nothing!  The food was incredible, I ordered my son take out and my daughter tried the pumpkin custard sticky rice...WIN! Was SO good. My only mistake was not ordering me one. My sons dish was beyond amazing...I wish I could remember what it's called. It is a noodle bowl. That will be what I order next time. Not that my soup wasn't scrum-didly-yumptuous, because it was.  We live pretty far away, but as long as the weather is good and outdoor seating is available, we will always have an excuse to go there because we will take the dog to Frick park for outdoor walking fun and top it off with the Thai Cottage for real.  I think we are going to make Thai Cottage a long-term habit and summer tradition!",

Shrimp Pad Thai is fantastic. Good portion eat in or take-out, with tons of big, juicy shrimp. The Cottage Wings are quite honestly the best wings I've had in Pittsburgh. I could probably eat 20+ of these things at a time. Everything I've eaten has been perfect.  The staff is also very welcoming. The taller lady (I think she may be the owner or manager) always greets us with a friendly smile, kind words, and excellent service. She seems to really be doing what she loves (and she's doing a great job). We have never waited for a table here, even with the place being as tiny as it is.  My girlfriend and I live close enough to walk to this place, and we do so on a fairly regular basis. It's our go-to if we want to stay local.  The only (small) complaints are as follows: They serve soda in cans, but this is sort of the modus operandi for a lot of Thai restaurants, so I can't really come down too hard on them for this one. The other issue is how close the seating can be, but this sort of thing comes with the territory in the city.",

Fresh ingredients and robust in flavor; everything on the menu is delicious.  Normally I stick to my Tofu Pad Thai, but here I've ventured off and tried other amazing dishes.  Basil fried rice - where you can actually taste the basil, iand several curries to dance on your taste buds.  My current favorite is Pineapple Curry with Tofu.  I never though I would enjoy curry... I had a bad experience in college where someone ruined it for me.  However this dish allowed me to fall in love again.  The perfect combination of sweet and savory, this dish awakens my palate.  The best question: \"How hot do you want it? From 1 to 10.\"  Make mine a 7, or if I'm daring, 8.  Thai Cottage is BYOB so feel free to bring a tasty adult beverage if you so desire.  Or try their Thai Iced Tea for something different.    Next time you're craving Thai, head to Regent Square and dine at Thai Cottage.  You can thank me later.",

Until recently, the food was always consistently good and the service in the restaurant when Belle is working is second-to-none.  I have no reason to doubt that the service is still great in the restaurant.  However, the quality of the food that I've been getting from Thai Cottage for delivery has deteriorated over the last 6 months.  Today, I ordered my usual and the See Ew was sweeter than usual and lukewarm (that could be a Grub Hub issue), the shrimp fresh roll had a shrimp shell in it and whatever they did to the peanut sauce should be undone. The new peanut sauce is very sweet and it lacks the kick that the old peanut sauce had. The pad se ew was supposed to be medium spicy, but there was not heat to it at all.  Also, you used to get either soup or salad with your lunch entree.  But, now, you only get one fried cheese won-ton.  I'm sad.  I don't know if Thai Cottage changed hands or if they got a new chef... but, the changes aren't for the better.  Let's hope things improve.  I want to love this restaurant again.",

The service was great, and the ambience of this place is so comfortable and cute. My friend ordered spring rolls and we both had the Pad Thai. The entrees came with a soup or salad. The lunch specials were around $8, which was not stated on the menu, but was a nice surprise at the end of the meal. Everything came out rather quickly and was wonderful. I highly recommend this restaurant.",

I ordered the chicken satay, green curry, and pad see eew, which came to thirty-some dollars.   Was disappointed upon getting home and unwrapping the seriously small portions. I couldn't believe that even the white rice container was only 3/4 full. They are seriously skimping on white rice? I'd put the portion size at maybe 60% of other Thai restaurants nearby (e.g. Bangkok Balcony or Curry on Murray), but at nearly the same prices.   The saving grace was that the food was delicious. Perhaps portion sizes are better in-house?",

It's the one dish I didn't care for in well over a dozen visits, and since it was my first ever wild curry, it may just be a flavor I don't like (the server warned me it was different from the other curries because it doesn't have coconut milk). The Pad Thai and Pad See Ew are also fantastic. My absolute favorites are the pumpkin and panang curries...absolutely perfect.",

We had two Bubble teas that were one of the best I've had in the city. Spring rolls, which also were very delicious. For our dinner we had pad Thai and spicy tofu eggplant and rice. Both dinners were very good and will definitely eat here again.   Being that this is a Thai restaurant they will ask you what scale you want your food on the spicy scale. I like very spicy food, so I asked them to make it as hot as they can. Not sure if they didn't trust me or if my idea of spicy and their idea of spicy is different. My girlfriend who doesn't even like spicy (got her pad Thai at a spice level 0) tasted my sauce and said she too couldn't taste that it was spicy. I removed a star for this, but altogether it was a great experience and will be back.",

Wooden tables and seats and an assortment of beautiful lanterns hanging from the ceiling provided dim lighting for a romantic setting. The bench along the wall on the right had pillows to cushion your back. Boyfriend and I ordered crab fried rice, pad see ew, and lychee green tea to go. There were a few tables for outdoor seating where we sat to wait for our food. When it was ready, a very smiley and sweet server came outside to bring us our food. It was only an 8-10 minute wait. I wanted to order the crab fried rice because the last time I had it at a Thai restaurant, it was fantastic. This one, however, wasn't nearly as good, but it was still a decent dish. The pad see ew was a little better. The lychee green tea was too sweet. I wasn't crazy about the food here, but would love to come back and eat in to enjoy the ambiance.

The staff is friendly and efficient. The curries are all excellent, red, green, yellow and traditional Massaman are all tasty.  Chicken is thin cut and delicious in curries and soups.  Summertime is nice to eat hear because of the outdoor seating allowing for enjoying lunchtime sun and for people watching in the Square.  Many other places to stop near by.  I recommend the restaurant.",

It was quite spicy for me! At other Thai places in Pittsburgh I can easily handle a 4, so that's important to note.   Good, solid Thai. I will continue to eat here!",

The ambiance of the place was very unassuming. The server was so kind and sweet to us as well as everyone else in the place on a Sunday afternoon. Doesn't look like much from the outside but the inside is welcoming, calming and enjoying. Very unpretentious but the food was great!!!  I'll be back!",

Very small inside and not super great decor, although I loved the lamps. There were a good number of things on the menu that were vegetarian, which I really liked.   I order the Penang curry with tofu and fresh rolls. I also tried my brother's Sunrise Tofu. The curry was good! I really liked the freshness of the vegetables. It was spicy, but tolerable and enjoyable. The tofu was cooked well and there were a lot of pieces in my curry. The rice was big and fluffy too, which I liked. The fresh rolls were slightly too large or maybe lacking in some moist ingredients, I ended up using a lot of peanut sauce. I'd like to come back and try the pumpkin curry this fall, I will update as needed!",

    "text": "We came here on a Saturday evening.  We found some off street parking and walked in.  It was busy and took about 10 minutes for us to be waited on.  They finally did greet us and we got a seat.  My wife Carrie N. has a really good detailed review of our experience so I didn't want to repeat all that she said.  You can read it for yourself.  Our experience here was very odd the more that I think about it.  Anyways we were hungry and ready to eat. Usually at Thai places we can get in and out of there pretty quickly.  That was not the case this night.  It took about an hour for us to eat and leave.       To start we ordered a spring roll and our entrees at the same time.  Usually spring rolls take less than 5 minutes and then our main food would come out like 10 minutes after.  This night our rolls took about 25 minutes and seconds after we got our rolls our entrees came out.   I thought the rolls were really good.  We got Tofu in them and we both liked them.  I ordered the See Ew for my entree with chicken.         Presentation wise it looked good. I asked for a spice level of 7 and it was spot on.  I think the taste was good but my noodles were really choppy and the chicken too.  The noodles were some small and some large which I don't like.  The waitress never came over to see how our food was or if we needed more to drink.  Which we did.  She didn't come until we were already done with our food and I asked for our check.  Then when I paid she put some old candy there for us and this tootsie roll that was old and out of it's wrapper.  Gross and very strange.  We walked out the door and I smiled at our waitress and the hostess while we were leaving thinking they would say bye or something.  I thought they would say thanks and have a good night but they didn't' say anything.  It was like they wish we weren't there and for us not to come back again.  Wish granted!       Maybe it was an odd night here and maybe they are better for take out only.  I'm not really sure but we wont be back to find out.",

    "text": "Would I come here again.  Nah, hard pass on that.  I have been to several mediocre Thai establishments but this has to be the most mediocre followed by some of the worst service that I've experienced within recent history.  We came out on a Saturday night.  True to most Thai establishments in the city, Thai Cottage is quite small.  We walked in and were worried we would have to wait to be seated, however even though they seemed to be busy we were seated quickly as there were a few empty tables and two waters along with menus plopped before us.  Everything seemed to go downhill from here.  As we reviewed the menu, one of the waitresses plopped two more glasses of water down within a minute after we were seated with two full glasses already.  If I would have known what was to come I would have asked her to leave them.  She realizes after paying attention to the table that we already had some.  An eye roll later and she picks them up and walks away.  She comes back to collect our order which was an order of fresh rolls, and two noodle dishes, mine being Kee Mow at a spice level 10.    What happens next and for the next 25-30 was nothing.  We sat and waited, and waited, and waited some more.  It's Saturday yes, but this is getting to be ridiculous.  At least serve the rolls.  I said to my husband that this had to be the longest wait for fresh rolls ever.  Not to mention in this 25+ minute wait our server or any server never came to check on us, provide an update, or refill our glasses.  Finally our rolls were delivered.  Abruptly placed down as she scurried off to find plates and silverware/chop sticks.  She drops those off just long enough for me to request some Thai chili paste.  After dropping that off I surveyed our rolls.  They were not cut, as I prefer but the flavor was pretty good.   However they were ice cold.  I mean cold like out of a fridge cold, which makes sense since they were probably made ahead of each shift.   Just as I was preparing to eat here comes our server with our entrees.  Wait what?  We waiting 30 minutes for cold rolls and now you give our entrees within a minute of serving our appetizer which we had yet to try.  I kind of just made mention like um ok, so now I need to move all this stuff over to make room for my plate as the less than patient server was trying to push the plates onto the table.  There was no sorry or anything.  I felt like we were bothering her just being there.  She pushes the plates off and leaves.  Slightly annoyed but hungry we jump right in.  As stated the rolls were good but cold like out of a fridge.  When we finished that we moved onto the entrees.  The cold is a continuing theme with my meal.  The noodles on the outside were cold, and the ones in the middle of the plate were a bit warmer but not enough to make the overall dish warm.  It seemed to me that the server just straight up forgot our table then last minute remembers and tries serving everything at once including our hot entree that probably sat in the pass for quite some time before being delivered.  Despite the colder noodles the spice level was decent.  I could have had a little more heat as I dumped some chili paste in but overall good.  However the noodles were not  made or prepared well.  They were very choppy and the dish was greasy.  So greasy it hurt my stomach and kind of made me feel sick the rest of the night.  While eating we ran out of water, and of course no server around to ask for more.  When she finally emerges we ask for refills and with the same crummy attitude she slaps a carafe of water down and walks away but not before my husband asks for the check.  She hurries back with our check and with our check she provides two pieces of candy.  Ok this candy (tootsie rolls) is partially unwrapped and smashed.  Who the hell would offer this to their customers.  We quickly pay and high tail it out of there.  No thank you, good night or please come back upon our departure.  Nope just some rude, candy smashing, cold noodle servers chatting it up amongst themselves.  Maybe this was an off night but I will not be returning.",

I can't speak to authenticity, since I've never been to thailand, but I can say the food is delicious, and will hit the spot with the usual suspects of things you can expect from an American Thai restaurant.

I judge all Thai places by their Pad Thai and this is some of the best Pad Thai I've had. It was a perfect sized portion, full of meat, and just the right amount of spice. A lot of the Pad Thai meat is just greasy peices of meat, but at this place, even the meat had flavour!! My friend got a curry dish and he loved it as well, The waitresses were super sweet and attentive as well, an added bonus.",

We live in the area so it's nice to know there's a great Thai place right around the corner (though I never got the chance to try Green Mango).  We got to sit outside because it was beautiful out (what's up winter?), and were immediately greeted with two waters. We ordered the fresh rolls to start--enticed by the basil and mint leaves and the peanut dipping sauce--and they arrived not 2 minutes later (and were delicious!)  Next we split an entree, (also out in mere minutes) and it was plenty of food for both of us. We had the pork pad gra prao and it was very tasty (though spicy so watch out! we asked for medium spice and I'm glad we did because it definitely had a kick).   Our total came to $17 for both of us, and we left feeling comfortably full--not overstuffed. The servers here are so friendly and the food was great. I foresee us becoming regulars! :)",

The seven was just spicy enough to make you sweat in a good way.  So much flavor, veggies and seafood.  Fantastic service, portion and price.

I asked for a 5 out of a scale of 10 since it was my first time at the restaurant and figured I could add hot oil if it was too mild. To my dismay it was too hot and lacked distinct flavors other than the salt.  The friend I was with is from what we call the \"clean the plate club\" but she did not clean her plate also stated that food was too salty.  Very disappointing overall. The service was also slow and they were not that busy. I will not be returning. I will have to drive the extra miles to Monroeville.",
