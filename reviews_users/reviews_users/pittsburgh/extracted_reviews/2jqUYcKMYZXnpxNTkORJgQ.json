The potatoes were really good, cooked perfectly and not dried out at all. Toast was extra but it was just simple toast. Challah french toast wad the winner here with 4 large halves of toast with fruit and whipped cream. It was made perfectly,  not mushy at all and neither was it too crispy, it was just right! Good coffee and lots of bottled drinks to pick from as well. I can't wait to try it out for lunch sometime soon.",

She wanted to eat at Pamela's Diner, despite my feedback that it was routine diner food, especially if you try to avoid gluten and therefore don't want to partake of their signature crepe-style pancake.  Anyway, we learned the wait for Pamela's on a Sunday morning was an expected 45 minutes ... not wanting to lose that much time, we walked around the corner to Cafe Raymond, and I was SO happy we did.  Pro's: 1) less than a 5 minute wait; 2) cold brew coffee was delicious; 3) execution of my omelet was top-notch; without the considerable grease of a diner.  Con's: onions were advertised as \"sauteed\", but they were basically raw.  I like the former; dislike the latter, but wasn't that hard to pick them off.  Next time I'll skip them.",

Every breakfast place had lines around the corners so we flipped a coin and ended up here. We waited about 20-25 min for a seat. The restaurant is pretty small but they do offer a little bit of outside seating. The menu is pretty simple breakfast, sandwiches, burgers and salads. They didn't have a turkey burger so I went with the ciabatta and lox sandwich which came with a side of seasoned potatoes. The seating is very intimate by the way . All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked delicious especially the French toast.  It took about 15 min for our food to arrive. My potatoes were very well seasoned! My sandwich was ok. It had all of the essential items tomato, capers, red onion and cream cheese. I enjoyed my sandwich and for as busy as it was the customer service was great.",

Lean cuts of warm pastrami sliced thin on premium bread with melted cheese and a generous amounts of whole grain mustard, lettuce and tomato, all fresh. My friend got a turkey sandwich. It looked like the sandwich belonged on the cover of a food blog. The care taken to make both sandwiches was great. Red velvet cookie was perfect and pasta salad was amazing. Will return very soon.",

The blueberry ricotta pancakes that draw so many to this cafe are delicious--sweet, crispy at the edges, fluffy pancakes brimming with large and juicy blueberries. I don't usually get pancakes out because I make great pancakes, but I was pleased my daughter found the reviews of these and convinced me to share them with her. We also shared some eggs with cheddar cheese, served with a toasted ciabatta roll. It's supposed to be a sandwich on a croissant but they were very nice about changing it the way we requested (it wasn't a busy weekend morning). For tea drinkers they carry Harney & Sons teas, which is a nice touch. It's in bags rather than loose leaf, but I know there aren't a LOT of tea drinkers around here, so I am accustomed to it--it was just nice to have a decent tea with my brunch. I'd return for the pancakes--they're definitely better than most you'd get in a restaurant.",

You order your meal at the register up front and then take a seat indoors or outdoors. I came in between breakfast and lunch so I decided to order the veggie muffaletta sandwich to go. You could taste the freshness of the veggies and let me tell you it was delish! The sandwich came with grilled portobello, eggplant, zucchini, squash, roasted red pepper, olive salad, pesto and provolone on focaccia for $7.75. This sandwich was a lot bigger than I expected for the price. I am really excited to try their breakfast during my next visit. They also have a case filled with fresh pastries from scratch that look so yummy!",

I ordered two eggs breakfast with chicken, but chicken was simply boiled and tasteless , I could not even touch it. The coffee was even worse than the ones you get from creepy gas stations, the egg did not have salt on it, there was only 6 pieces of home fries, I will never try this restaurant anymore.

You basically order at the counter, choose a seat and you are given a number for your order that you take to the table.  Most items on the menu are ala carte with the exception of their special combinations. I decided to order the cooked vegetables on foccata bread, My son ordered the Cafe Raymond burger special that comes with a choice of side and dessert. He ordered a side salad and a red velvet cookie. All sandwiches come with potato chips. Bottled water and other beverages are located in the refrigerator behind you that you can help yourself and pay for it.  We had our food in record time. My vegetable sandwich was so rich and filling I was amazed I could even finish it. It was so good! My son's burger came topped with an egg as well as your usual toppings. He told me he loved every bite of it. He also ordered for dessert a red velvet cookie which is his favorite. He loved that too!  Outside seating is available if you want to sit out on a hot day. Bike parking is nearby and you probably would do well to park on Smallman St and walk over. Please note that reception is bad in the place and there is no free  Wi Fi.  I was thrilled to have my first experience here and am looking forward to trying out their other offerings. Believe me you won't leave hungry!",

The kitchen was open so you could see the cooks. There was the newly adopted, grouped seating but we had our own table. We were taken care of right away and our table was claimed, and we were to order at the front first. They have a lot of chalkboard signs which I'm a big fan of. The menu was pretty cool and they had just enough options. The best part is that they serve breakfast all day. I really liked that they had cream and sugar at a separate part so that you can add that to your tea or coffee. The waitress who was taken care of the tables was pretty nice and she started conversation. She made sure we wer taken care of. This place wasn't crowded and wasn't hard to be seated, especially on Saint Patrick's Day morning On the strip in which I had reservations that we wouldn't be sat. It was easy to do. What can I say..I like my tea like I like him; hot, blonde and sweet. :)",

    "text": "I can't tell you how many times I passed this gem up, simply because when I'm in the Strip, I feel obligated to go for food from another culture entirely (I do curry or sushi here a lot). So when I was looking for a place to please a group of four friends, I didn't think of Cafe Raymond. However, we were all hungry enough that we stumbled in to the closest place: I am SO glad it was this place. Once we got in, it was obvious we'd be waiting a bit to order (the line for lunch on a Sunday is no joke!) so we took our time scoping out the menu. I have to say, I was impressed by their wide range of tantalizing options! I ended up landing on the Veggie Muffaletta, served on focaccia bread. First impression: This sandwich is massive! Definitely 2 meals, unless you go starving hungry. And it tasted Amazing. Like a folded homemade focaccia made by a loving Italian grandma. Friends got The Club, a Spinach, Mushroom and Feta Omelette, and the special of the day: Italian Style Eggs Benedict, which I tried. It was really wonderful... I liked my Veggie Muffaletta just a TAD bit more. Next for me to try: Coffeehouse Burger! I'm not usually a burger gal, but it just sounds STELLAR. I'd say this place is a must-try. With everything made from scratch and deliciously fresh ingredients, you're bound to love Raymond!",

Everyone was very impressed with the Mediterranean Salad that consisted Spring mix, feta cheese, roasted red tomatoes, olives, capers, kalamata olives, cucumbers, red onions and Raymond's house lemon vinaigrette. They did not skimp, so if you are not a fan of any item, ask them to go light especially the onions since red onions are quite strong.  Nice assortment of signature sandwiches. Chocolate chip, oatmeal raisin and red velvet cookies were very fresh and quite the hit. Order was delivered on time and accurately.",

But it made the texture of the pancakes SO FLUFFY! It was almost creamy actually. You can't really taste the cheese because it is so blueberry-y but not overly sweet. A must get.  And I got an omelet. It was also SO FLUFFY! It was super thick- almost like an egg cake/souffle type dish. I had it filled with bacon, swiss cheese, and mushrooms and was pleasantly surprised because it wasn't too salty. Just perfect.   Definitely come here if you're ever in Pittsburgh! Make sure to get here kind of early too because it gets very busy!",

There were a few people in line ahead of us, but we didn't wait to order our food for no more than 5 minutes. The staff was super friendly from the second we walked in the door to the time we left. Once we sat down, our food was in front of us before we knew it. I got the ham & Gruyere croissant with an added egg, and my husband got the NY smoked salmon platter. Everything was so fresh!! We also split a raspberry and cheese danish, and it was delicious!   One thing we couldn't help but notice was how CLEAN everything was. Everything was wiped down, the kitchen is open so we could see it all and it looked like everything was brand new. Maybe it was, but it looks like they run a tight ship, and we were very pleased about that.   We will definitely be back soon. I have to try those pancakes I've been hearing so much about!",

We got drinks out of the cooler at the front of the restaurant and an extra bag of New Orleans chips as a side since they are a rarity to find in pgh. I've  had their catering on multiple occasions in the past but had never visited be cafe. This weekend we found ourselves in the strip looking for a good sandwich and I'm so glad we chose cafe Raymond. I had the turkey club which came with roasted potatoes, and it was great. The quantify and quality of my meal definitely met my expectations. The salads and baked goods also looked delicious as many people were eating both of them around me. I'm looking forward to the next time I stop in for a delicious meal.",

You can tell it's all made with fresh ingredients even down to the fresh cream on the French toast! I was sceptical at first as I usually like traditional restaurants where they seat you and you get your bill later.. Not a fan of newer style restaurants and the system they have. But it makes sense. We were asked at least twice by different staff how everything was and that was nice! They seem to take pride in the dishes they serve which is nice. Colin was exceptionally nice and was very accommodating when we asked for more syrup. Overall was a great experience. My only comment is how do you know how much to tip when you pay first? Not familiar with how this process works as I'm used to tipping based on the service from the waitstaff but I guess those days are gone. And how do you know WHO your tip is going to? So many people came to the table.",

What made this meal fantastic was that we were kind of able to share the dishes and combine the smoked salmon with eggs (one of my fave combos). The eggs were good although not incredibly flavorful, same with the toast. Quality salmon, and perfect spice on the potatoes. The blueberry pancakes were fluffy and delicious topped off with 100% pure, local maple syrup. Our meal was a a bit pricey but we got a ton of food and really enjoyed ourselves. A really great option for (all-day) breakfast in the strip.",

You get a table number and get to choose where you want to sit and the food will be taken to your table number.   I ordered the French toast on challah bread with a strawberry jam-type drizzled on top with blueberries and whipped cream. It came with FOUR pieces!! So it was very filling. We also ordered the blueberry ricotta pancakes. I expected the ricotta to be pretty overwhelming but to my surprise it wasn't too much! I liked the combination with the blueberries and the pancakes were very fluffy:)   Service was really nice and the restaurant wasn't too busy or crowded. Would definitely recommend this place and maybe even come here again to try their sandwiches.",

The food was decent- sausage and potatoes were extremely greasy but still tasty. It was also disproportional. The egg was omelette styled and massive compared to the croissant. Im not sure if there is a single person on this planet who could fit the whole thing in their mouth. I ate the sandwich with a knife and fork. Coffee was terrible- not surprising, though. Service was really fast. You order at the register and they will assign your party a table, and they will bring you your food when it's ready. They have two self service water dispensers, one plain and one infused with cucumber. Love that! I will be returning, though next time around, I'll probably choose one of the lunch sandwiches. Overall, a fine experience. I'm willing to give it another chance!",

Prices maybe a few dollars more than I would have expected for this type of set up but it was very good so I don't really mind that. My husband and I ate for $29.00. Not huge inside so I could imagine it would get very busy on the weekends here. Business appeared clean. Restrooms for customers in the basement.   My husband had the blue cheese burger which he said was really good. Came with side of chips. The blueberry ricotta pancakes were fabulous and I highly recommend them to anyone who likes pancakes! The omelette was also excellently made with the perfect ratio of ingredients to eggs.   Looking forward to coming back and trying one of their speciality sandwiches or salads!",

For some reason the Strip makes me feel like a tourist in my own city (in a good way!), and Cafe Raymond reinforced that as soon as I walked in. Very warm, bright, and inviting, I hopped into a line that moved quickly to place my order. The blueberry ricotta pancakes had been the reason that Cafe Raymond caught my eye on Yelp in the first place, so I put in my order and sat down to enjoy my coffee (which may have been from La Prima--it was delicious!) to ride out the short wait to my pancakes.  Now these pancakes... did not disappoint. I had been jonesing pancakes for days before this visit, and they were perfectly dense yet still fluffy and not too heavy, having a generous amount of blueberries dotted throughout. It came with whipped cream (which I was initially not super excited about, but after taking a bite, the effect of blueberries and cream came through) as well as local maple syrup on the side. It was a generous portion and I left full.  I would love to come back to sample the lunch menu--other folks around me looked like they had some delicious sandwiches and salads. Service was friendly and fast.",

    "text": "Ok, let me start by saying that I'm giving 3 stars instead of 5 for a few reasons unrelated to the food itself.   1. The counter staff and their lack of communication with the guests. This restaurant is unique because you order at the counter and then everything else is self serve. This concept is not new to me, but it was my first time at this establishment, and it would have been nice for the girl taking our order to simply say \"Have you eaten here before?\", and if we said \"No\", she could have simply taken a moment to explain how everything works.  2. The place was clean overall but there were quite a few gnats flying around the day I went.  3. This place is a BYOB and they charge you a $5 corking fee (which is fine), but they don't actually uncork your bottle for you. If you are going to charge me $5, at least uncork my Prosecco and offer wine glasses (which are available behind the counter), without me having to ask.   That being said, the food at Cafe Raymond was delicious. We ordered a few separate dishes and everyone was more than satisfied with their meal. We had the Two Eggs Breakfast, BLT Croissant, Corn Beef Hash with Two Eggs and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes. Our meal was served quickly and it was delicious.   As a person who was raised in the serving industry, I know that the staff can make or break a restaurant. And although I would consider going back to Cafe Raymond if I were specifically in the The Strip area, I would definitely rather spend my money somewhere like Square Cafe (Regent District), where both the food AND the service were outstanding.",

So what and who did we tip $8, the mystery remains.  We were told where to sit and there were no other options. Our number was there and that was it.  There was no service that brought water with our meal. Instead we were directed to the self serve \"water bar\" which we have no idea where the water is from on top of the fact they didn't even offer the option of purchasing bottled water.

Anyway, I had been to the old location no less than 100x for lunch over the years - would recommend lox salad and any soup. But this review is for their brunch, which I hadn't realize Cafe Raymond had. A quick search on Yelp for breakfast places and I just had to go.   I met a friend here and she was a few minutes ahead of me. She was able to grab a table and hot tea, no issues. Once I arrived, we placed our order at the counter then reclaimed our table. We were there a few minutes after 10am on a Sunday, which was perfect timing. As we sat waiting for our food, a huge line formed. It seems like people eat and leave pretty quickly though, so I can't imagine waiting for a table would take long. The ordering process is streamlined and they use a number system to locate you when your food is ready.   We both ended up ordering the same thing, which was surprising with so many good choices on the menu -- sausage, egg and cheese croissant. I was pleasantly surprised when it showed up with a side of potatoes. For ~$9, you can't beat it. The croissant was comprised of fluffy goodness and the egg arrived piping hot. There's a self-serve water station, which I always appreciate.  All of the staff I encountered were pleasant and it was a very successful start to my Sunday. Thanks, Cafe Raymond!",

So get there early if you can! Pancakes are off the charts!! Eggs and brisket hash was a great choice too. I ordered an omelette and it was perfect. Lots of food. But get pancakes to share then order something else so you can have a taste of everything!!",

    "text": "I walked past Cafe Raymond on my stroll to DeLuca's and and decided to backtrack here to avoid a wait...  First off, you smell the yumminess from this place as you walk by. Through the window, I noticed folks happily dining on breakfast foods and chatting a way. When we walked in, we were immediately greeted and given some suggestions for breakfast. You order at the counter and then seat yourself. The space is really inviting with warm wood decor everywhere, tables...counters, etc.  The menu seems to have some tasty offerings but my main focus was on breakfast this visit. The menu is simple with options for your normal platter of eggs, meat, potatoes and toast or some sammies. They had a brisket hash that sounded yummy but a little too heavy for me that early.  I opted for 2 eggs over med, bacon, potatoes, toast. I had a chance to sample some of another meal at the table too which is always a plus Lol.  The bacon was thick and very smokey and flavorful...I just wish it could've been cooked a tad bit more. The fat on the bacon needed some thrashing of the teeth to separate, for lack of a better description. Eggs were cooked well. The potatoes had a boat load of pepper on them which caught me off guard.  Every piece didn't have that much pepper but it seemed like it was a steak type of seasoning on them. They were ok...didn't really enjoy them. Now, that ricotta blueberry pancake I had a bite of made me regret my choice! This thing was fluffy, light and full of blueberry goodness.  The maple syrup was delish as well. I could eat those forever but my thighs would object. I saw a trend with the waitresses carrying multiple plates of those yummy cakes to other tables too. The drink options were limited and we settled on OJ, not fresh squeezed but it served the purpose. Maybe I'm being a bit cheap but our breakfast came to $33.12. That seems a bit pricey for what we ordered and $7 for OJ, I dunno. I will definitely go back for my own pancakes and look over the lunch offerings next time. I won't say I'm passionately in love with this spot but it's worth a test drive for sure.",

I had the special, which consisted of fried eggs atop a bbq beef hash. The bbq was flavorful, with a spicy kick at the end that had me finishing my plate in record time. The coffee was also pretty good, and the free refills were a nice added bonus. I'm looking forward to visiting the next time I'm in Pittsburgh, and seeing what else their menu has to offer!",

The first time I stopped in here for a quick lunch and was intrigued by the veggie muffuletta. It came with portabella mushrooms as the \"meat\". Although it wasn't quite as good as the original, it was certainly tasty and a bit healthier. Since then I have been here several times for breakfast and lunch. Everything I have tried has been excellent and the service is always good. There is very clean restroom facilities in the basement for customers (a good find in the strip). As a matter of fact, the whole restaurant is clean and bright with a definite New Orleans vibe. There is always water with fresh lemon available as self-serve. The bread is homemade on site and so is the breakfast sausage. I really love this place!",

I ordered the special of the day, which was the Southern Style Eggs Benedict, and she ordered an omelet. Our food arrived quickly and we both enjoyed it! The service was excellent as well.

But I was pretty disturbed to see the cook (white male with curly hair) touching people's food with his bare hands almost the entire time. Grabbing potatoes, bacon, ham, everything with his bare hands. He put gloves on briefly when he saw that I was staring him down and about to get up and say something to him. After we got our food I saw he took his gloves off again and was handling food again with bare hands! Super gross and disturbing. I had my mom with me who is currently undergoing chemo and her immune system is already low because of it. I won't be back. Super disgusting to see that.",

Our number was up stairs. Asked to sit at the balcony and we had the best view of the entire stripe.  We shared and love the Western omelette and Fresh toast. I am not a big fan of french toast but this blew my mind. A Must ordered. Omelet had super fresh ingredient, also one of the best I ever had. Amazing! Would come back again.",

    "text": "I should say the food is good. But the management, staff's attitude and general organization is really bad especially if you want to go there as a group. We went there today with a group of friends and had a reservation for a big group. We had to ask for utensils multiple times. Some of us already had their food and didn't have utensils. My own food was kind of cold by the time I had them and I had to distribute them around the table for everyone myself since no one was doing it.  We had a cake for a friend's birthday. They brought the cake after our food was over but they told us that we have to leave in 15 minute and they won't provide us utensils any more. We asked them why and their answer was \" we have another group coming by and you can't stay here the whole day\" with a rude manner. We asked the manager to come after a little discussion with no outcome with the staff. He first had the same position till we told him about how the staff have been speaking to us and that they hadn't brought one of the orders after almost 2 hours. He changed his position and clarified that they actually don't need the table any sooner than 45-50 minutes and that we can stay at least another 30-40 minute and that we should stay. But at that point too many of us were involved in the argument and everyone was too angry to stay or had already left. Any way if they had told us in the first place we need the table in 30 minutes it wouldn't be a problem. Or that if they had politely explained the situation in the first place it would have probably been resolved. They need to learn that big groups with 25 people won't leave in 1 hour especially if they still haven't received some of their orders after almost 2 hours and that if they have such expectations they should clarify that at the beginning or at the time of making the reservation",

The blueberry pancake is very fluffy and one of the best pancakes I've ever had -super friendly staff. Everyone stopped by to say hi to my baby and wave to her -hot sauce and napkins at each table! The Pittsburgh hot sauce was hilarious to read  Cons: -portions are really small for the price. Hubby got the lox platter and it was sparse. He had to eat at one of the other food stalls in order to be full. While that pancake was delicious, you only get ONE if you order the Guy's breakfast! No toast either and only ONE sausage patty.  -long wait to order and long wait for food. There were plenty of empty tables around us and I saw some people who came after us getting food earlier but that might be due to what they ordered. Anyways, it was like a close 20 min wait for our brunch dishes -cramped settings and sticky, wobbly tables",

When we moved to a better table we were told we could not sit there (the place was EMPTY) because they might fill up.   Asked to speak to a manager and was aggressively met by the owner, Raymond. He began yelling and cursing at me. Asked him not to yell at me and requested my money back. He continued on for some time yelling and cursing at me before instructing an employee to provide a refund. Debated calling the police to report this assault, however did not want to wait and gamble further escalation while we waited for officer response.   This is unacceptable behavior for anyone, especially for a business owner to aggressively intimidate and assault not only a paying customer but a woman as well. Will be reporting this experience through all means of social media, travel sites, and making formal complaints through AAA and the Pittsburgh department of tourism. No one else should have to go through this experience and be threatened by anyone.   Will never be back and work to spread the word to all who will listen.",

    "text": "This would have been a five star for the food, but I have to deduct a star or so for a crazy awkward process.   We stopped in for breakfast on a Saturday around 9.  It's fast-casual style...ish.  It looks like a fast casual setup, but then you discover that they have a sort-of-server who does some things, but not others.    To start, you go in and order at the counter.  The menu/pastries/specials are in a couple different places and it's a little overwhelming to choose quickly if there is someone behind you.  At some point; you are supposed to be given a number, presumably before you hit the cashier.  That didn't happen, so the cashier assigned a number, took our order, and then advised that someone would seat us with that number.   We were asked if we wanted inside or on the balcony, so at least that narrowed down the hunt when we went to find the table with our number on it.  When we found it, we saw that it was in a sunny corner.  I get it...it's outside and we asked for that...but if I'd been given the opportunity for input, I'd have picked one in the shade.     Anyhow, a server brought our food and checked in several times to see if we needed anything.  I found this weird for several reasons.  First, while she asked if we needed things, she wasn't actually going to bring about half of them.  We asked for water and were told that it was self-serve inside.  Ok - no problem - up we go.  Coffee was much more of a conundrum.  She came around and kept refilling, which then required us to keep getting up again and again to go inside for cream and sugar.  Why bring the coffee at all if you aren't going to bring the rest of it?  Just leave it all inside and we will get it at our leisure. Second, you pay inside when you order as if you are on your own from there.  Were we supposed to tip that limited service server?  She did bring the food and pick up the dishes.  No idea, but since we didn't have cash, we were a little stuck there.     All in all, the food was plentiful and delicious.  Not cheap for breakfast, but you get a lot for it and the flavors were good.   The process though was a little weird for me.",

Our dishes came out very quickly and the French Toast was plated nicely. The only reason I brought up the price of the dish was because it was definitely lacking in flavor. The strawberry sweetness was overpowering. I ended up having my friends finish my dish for me because it was too sweet. Another friend of mine ordered a dish that came with potatoes and those were also lacking in flavors. On another note, the ordering staff are very kind and helpful.   Cafe Raymond is a nice place to take a relative or date on the weekend, but the breakfast was lacking in flavors. Pamela's diner is cheaper and while the food is probably \"lower quality\" it is tastier than Raymond's.",

Warm even.  - Setting is cool. Very clean and fresh inside what must be an old building.   THE FOOD: Mine was great. I got a Raymond Burger, which is a pretty standard, large cheeseburger, with shredded lettuce, tomato, and \"special sauce.\"    It was served with a hand full of wavy chips and a huge dill pickle (that was excellent, I might add).  It was served very hot (my preference), on a pretty basic bun, but the bun was warm and very soft, obviously fresh. While there is no \"secret ingredient\" to this fairly standard burger, the execution was top notch. The beef was cooked medium well (trace of pink), and was very juicy. Excellent.   My side salad was surprisingly large and also very fresh and crisp. Comprised mostly of field greens, it did have some nice olives, cucumber slices, and other food stuff I can't remember.  It came with a house vinaigrette that worked well.   I see lots of all-day breakfast items on the menu, as well as lots of other sandwiches and burgers, so I need to go back and try more.   I definitely can recommend this place quite highly. Give it a try and fling us your take on it!  Yelp on!",

This room appeared to be specifically designed for private events. The space was large enough to fit 50-75 people, yet cozy enough to create a warm, intimate feel.   The highlight of the space was the attached balcony seating that overlooks the Strip District. It was the perfect place to admire the hustle and bustle of the busy streets below.   The food was delicious - a wide variety of sandwiches, fruits, pasta salads, bacon covered shrimp etc.  It was the perfect location for a celebration. I would highly recommend booking this location for future events",

I hadn't realized that you order your food and then get seated at a table. Luckily, I had looked up what I wanted to order, so I didn't have to hold up the line. The line was pretty long around 11:30am. But there were tables available and they had the patio open upstairs.   I ordered an omelette- you can pick up to 3 add-ins for your omelette. The omelettes come with a side of potatoes. I added bacon, cheddar cheese, and mushrooms. The omelette was delicious! It was full of toppings and was a great size for the price. The potatoes were a little spicy, but with a little Heinz ketchup- they were great.   I also split an order of lemon ricotta pancakes - they were wonderful. I definitely can understand why everyone likes them. They weren't the best pancakes I've ever had, but they were very good. I would definitely order them again or try the French toast next time.   Overall, I loved my experience at Cafe Raymond and will be back again soon!",

LEMON & RICOTTA PANCAKES ($9): So fluffy like what I'd imagine a cloud to taste like. Melted in your mouth like cotton candy. I highly recommend this if you're coming for breakfast or brunch.  FRENCH TOAST ($9): This jam is to die for. It's not too sweet, reminds me of a smoothie bowl. The french toast is also a bit crispy, but not too chewy. OMELETTE ($10): Got bacon, mushrooms, and swiss cheese (It says you can put up to 3 fresh ingredients). So so so cheesy, almost too cheesy for me. Crazy cheese pulls, perfect for pics. This gave the extra edge of savoriness to our shared meal. These three picks were perfect to share together, as they all had their own strengths of sweetness, tanginess, and savoriness.  Got busy around lunchtime on a weekday really fast, good thing we came at 11. I was so impressed by the breakfast foods that I would love to come back for lunch for their gourmet sandwiches.",

We sat upstairs outside on the balcony.  Ordered the coffee, a half order of French toast, the ricotta pancakes, and home-fries. Also tried the rosemary walnut scone, pecan bar, and the oil cake. Everyones food arrived to the table hot, and all of the pastries were wonderful. The coffee was strong and hot. Coffee and water are self serve.   The only con is the where and the way you order your food. There's a counter with the menu posted on the wall not very far from the entrance. There are people waiting behind you while you order, and it makes ordering fairly tense. The door to get to the steps to go upstairs is right at the front entrance near the counter. By the time we left, the line was out the door and you have to be careful not to hit the people waiting in line with the door.   Overall it the food and the service after we were seated  was good. If I'm in the strip district again, I'd definitely go back.",

Food/pricing is fair for the strip district and our meals have always been delicious.   There definitely room for improvement on the overall flow/organization. Food comes out decently fast once seated, but it takes forever to order at the front counter. There's also some disorganization to the table number process and lack of communication between upstairs/downstairs waitstaff, which is very confusing as the customer.   My biggest gripe is the coffee situation. You get an empty mug that you fill yourself at the coffee station, but then you have to carry a hot cup of coffee all the way to your table upstairs. I just don't see how this is safe at all, especially when you're trying to juggle your kid. Maybe I'm being overly cautious but I think it's a huge safety issue and could be a huge problem if someone were to spill/burn themselves or worse, a child!   One suggestion is to eliminate the coffee at the coffee stations and simply have insulated coffee pots brought to the table by your waitress and left there so they don't have to go around filling coffees.",

This spot is located in a very fun area in the strip district where there's old warehouses, fun shops and open air markets. So as a fan of all three- I was in heaven. We came up this way and at first struggled with parking and a decent traffic flow, but managed to snag a spot and do some walking. Upon walking in we were greeted and explained how things work- order up front and scoop a table. Decor is very barn style and colorful with different chairs, looks of wood etc.   They serve breakfast all day, which is a huge plus for me personally. I could eat breakfast all year. However, from looking at the menu they all have salads and sandwiches and plenty to choose from. Not to mention homemade scones, cookies, and pastries up front as well. Man man man.  We ordered some breakfast and coffee and tea respectively- and took our seat and hung out. Planning your day over coffee while waiting for breakfast is low key my favorite activity on a Saturday so this hit the spot.   Food was INCREDIBLE. I went with the omelette with bacon cheese and spinach. It was quite possibly the largest, thiccest, fluffiest omelette I have had. Also- was served with home fries which I didn't see on menu. Another added plus. Home fries had a nice flavor and kick to them, and condiments are available on the table.   Coffee was good as well- though I would've liked to have more options on dressing it besides just room temp half and half.   Great spot. I love it.",

Looked like they had sandwiches and other menus but we wanted to try their breakfast menus. Food portions are pretty decent so you won't be leaving this place hungry.  Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes ($9): I am not a pancake person. But this might be the BEST PANCAKES I've ever had in my life. Ricotta cheese makes the texture so soft and creamy! Seriously you will regret not getting this.  French Toast ($9): Four pieces of toasts with strawberry glaze sauce on top. The sauce almost tastes like strawberry puree or smoothie. It doesn't taste artificially sweet and really adds that natural sour-sweet to the dish.  Omelette ($10): Omelette with three ingredients from their list. We picked bacon, swiss cheese, and mushroom. Comes with a side of roasted potatoes. If you are a savory breakfast person, this would be a good dish to go with.",

Everything here seems to be made fresh including their baked goods, chips and bread.  I decided to get the club sandwich which was turkey breast, hickory smoked bacon, muenster, spring mix, tomato, avocado spread & chipotle aioli on whole wheat. I had no bacon on mine but she put it on the side for my husband! The sandwich was spicy and had such a good taste. I also had the side salad with a lemon vinaigrette. It was a nice leafy salad and the dressing had a good flavor that complimented the salad and red onions on it well. The chips that come with your sandwich are also homemade. They are a crisp ruffle chip. Plus I could not leave without trying an oatmeal raisin cookie! SO moist and fresh!!  The service was super friendly and everything was quick. Definitely a nice spot in the strict to grab lunch and a tasty Sammy!",

We also went on a Saturday at 2:30 (right before closing!) and there was absolutely no wait.  We both had the Chicken Cheesesteak which came with a pickle and potatoes.  It was the perfect meal for shopping in the Strip District.  The waitress/cashier was really nice and answered a gazillion questions we had when ordering.  It was a great quiet place to eat and catch up with my friend.",

    "text": "Pretty disappointed in this place with regards to food and service. When I sat down at a table with my 9 month baby, a man (I think the owner Ray) started barking at me down the hallway saying \"YOU CAN'T SIT, YOU DON'T HAVE A NUMBER\", literally as my parents were paying for our food. Geez, I just wanted to settle my baby down, you didn't have to yell and make me feel terrible for my first time there. We sat in front of the kitchen, and the whole time I kept listening to him micro manage all the employees and even argue with them in front of our family at least 3 times. Everyone who worked there literally seemed miserable and we didn't get one smile the whole time. The food was not seasoned AT ALL, and over half my plate was just bland potatoes as filler. The only decent thing we ate were the blueberry ricotta pancakes, but I feel like I can make them at home next time. Sorry, even if the food was that great, that man was a huge turn off and there are better brunch joints with friendlier service than yours.",

The place is setup in an older style lunch spot way.  You order as you walk in from a chalkboard and seat yourself.  Everything from the plates to the seating go with their overall theme.  The kitchen is open to the restaurant which is a cool look.    The workers could not have been more friendly.  They gave us their picks for the best meal and side dish options.  They also got us our food very fast.  For my meal I had the blues burger.  It had bacon, blue cheese crumbles, and blue cheese sauce.  The flavors all came together it tasted delicious.  The peppercorn crusting was a little much and It was over cooked for the medium rare I ordered, but was still great.  Finally, the brioche bun was one of the best burger buns I have ever had and held all of the ingredients together perfectly.  I will definitely be back to try some more of their burgers and sandwiches.",

    "text": "** Solid brunch place in the strip district with a wide selection of breakfast foods (all day) as well as sandwiches. Blueberry ricotta pancakes are for sure a highlight to check out.  This place has been super hyped up to me after hearing my girlfriend and her friends rave about how good the ricotta pancakes were, how they were \"so soft that they melt in your mouth,\" and how this place is the \"best breakfast place in Pittsburgh.\" Eventually I had to check it out to see if they were just blowing up smoke or this place was legit. After coming here with her to try out their ricotta pancakes, I have to say they were't exaggerating.   I ordered the guy's breakfast, which came with a good variety of bacon, eggs, potatoes and the blueberry ricotta pancakes. I love having a variety of different foods to eat in one breakfast plate, with a combination of sweet and savory so to me this place got off to a good start. Everything about the savory foods was just as you'd expect to be, nicely seasoned, warm and tasty.   The pancakes were definitely what set Cafe Raymond apart... and no lie my teeth sunk right through the warm pancake immediately upon contact. There were real berries found in the pancake as well, and the pancake tasted fresh, unlike other places where they taste like they have been sitting out for awhile. What I also liked was the fact that the pancake wasn't overly sweet, allowing you to adjust the sweetness to your liking with however much syrup you desire.   This is a place I'd definitely come back to if I have the chance!",

The brisket and pulled pork were just heavenly....melted in your mouth!  There were also 3 different types of BBQ sauce, each of which was delish!  Everything was homemade, better than your \"usual\", and fresh!

    "text": "When I think of a classic lunch, I usually think of sandwiches and salads. Cafe Raymond has arguably some of the best sandwich and salad options in the Strip District, and they have breakfast, too! I haven't had the pleasure of having their breakfast yet, but I can definitely see it in my future.  My mom came down to meet me for lunch last week, and knowing she's a big fan of club sandwiches I suggested Cafe Raymond. She threw me for a loop and got a burger, and she said she was in more of a burger mood on this particular day. I opted for the veggie wrap, being that Thanksgiving was just two weeks ago and I felt like I needed something a bit healthier, to say the least. I learned during my first visit that it's a good idea to opt for potatoes rather than the regular chips that come alongside a sandwich because they're delicious!   Our food arrived quickly and the portion sizes were good. My mom's burger was so juicy and the bun looked incredibly soft, and to a person that isn't big on beef burgers it looked amazing. My wrap was also great, and I loved all the roasted veggies and the pesto oil that pulled it all together. Our meals even with the small upcharge for potatoes was still just over $20 for the two of us, which isn't bad at all for lunch.  The first time I visited Cafe Raymond, I got the special which was a pulled pork grilled cheese. I'm not sure how often specials change, but I was sure glad I ordered it this time! My sandwich was huge and had more pork than cheese on it, and the pork was juicy and covered in BBQ sauce.. I've never had a bad experience out of the couple times I've visited Cafe Raymond, and I'm excited to come back in the future!",

Because the ordering seating process is easy peasy and yum You order at the counter get a number find a table sit relax and soon your food is there They have have blueberry ricotta pancakes light and fluffy come with real maple syrup my favorite of their breakfast offerings. There are egg Sammies and classic egg offerings My friend raves about their Rubin  Says it's the best Rubin in the burgh I've ordered it with out meat Raymond's was very accommodating my non meat rubin was delish (ok its a grilled cheese with sauerkraut and Russian dressing) it really hit my Sammie craving that day. Salads and Sammies make for a perfect lunch There are beautiful pastry and brownies for you to order. Fresh  There is self serve water   Everyone is always friendly   Depending on time and day parking can be a hassle that's just the way it is in this neighborhood but Raymond's is worth finding that spot",

There was a line right out the door.  I got the House smoked brisket hash and it was delicious and the portion was large. Potatoes were cooked perfectly and there was actually a lot of brisket, which was good! The general consensus with this establishment: large portions and delicious (also pretty!)  Their pancakes are delicious... perfectly fluffy and dense but not too sweet; literally perfect.   However, it's a little pricey. That's my only complaint! I think for my dish and my boyfriend's, it came out to $26. Pretty expensive for breakfast in my opinion, but I would come here again if I ever found myself in the strip.",

I see a ton of 5 star reviews and I have to say for me at least I was a bit surprised. My first impression walking in was Cafe Raymond was a nice looking place and staff seemed very nice. Then I found out you had to go to register first and order then sit down and wait for food. This is not your typical diner were you sit and a waiter or waitress takes your order. Once you order at the counter they give you a number stand to put at table so they know were to serve food. To be honest when it comes to breakfast I am not that adventurous, I order the same thing all the time. I had 2 eggs over easy and bacon and home fires and white toast. The coffee is served at the table but if you need milk or sugar you have to get up and go to the area that has that. The coffee was a bit bitter for my taste I really did not like it at all. The meal itself was ok, The eggs were cooked fine and tasted fine. The bacon was ok nothing special. The wait staff and cashier were very friendly and very helpful. The service was excellent overall. Unfortuanlty I do not think I would not go back again unless my wife wanted to. I like sitting down and someone taking my order and then being served. I do not like waiting at the cashier to order first then sitting down and then having to get up to do your coffee. Cafe Raymond was not for me at all. overall the service was excellent, The place was clean and well run. MY only big complaint is the waiting at the register to order & the coffee was terrible. I would of given Cafe Raymond 2 stars , But the food and service was good overall so ill give them 3 stars.",

She got the egg and cheese croissant which came with home fries, and I got the meal that came with breakfast meat, eggs, and one blueberry ricotta pancake. That was the ticket item everyone said to try but I'm usually more of a savory breakfast person over sweet. So the meal I got was perfect for someone wanting a little of each! Mine also came with home fries, though I don't think that was listed on the menu. Surprise potatoes with my meal? Always a plus!  I enjoyed the pancake a lot, the ricotta definitely made it a softer, more gooey consistency and a little less sweet. I don't know how many scrambled eggs they gave me but it was a lot. When I ordered she asked if I wanted cheese and I said sure and they put two slices of cheddar on top of my pile of eggs. Too much for me, and I'm a cheese lover. Bacon was perfect and crispy and home fries were good with some nice seasoning. I left potatoes and eggs in my plate because I was full. My friend took half of her croissant sandwich to go also as she was full, it was huuuuge. The croissant looked fresh and flaky and she said it was delicious. Would go back! I can see this getting very busy on weekends though, small place so go early!",

As such, this joint has moved from their old location a little down the block but still on the same street. As soon as I entered, I could notice what an improvement the new place is easily over the old place ... wow. I chose to order the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes along with two eggs sunny-side up and a sausage. For those of you who don't know, you order at the counter and they'll give you a number plaque and bring your order right to you when it's ready. Bit into the pancakes and it brought back memories of when I had it the first time ... really, just as good as they've ever been. Freshly made, the maple syrup was a wonderful addition, and I could really appreciate the thought of using real fruit (blueberries). Quite yummy indeed. Eggs were also well done. I will ding them on the sausage though as I thought it was a little too hard for my liking ... probably overcooked so if anything, I would suggest taking the sausage out just a little earlier to preserve what would otherwise be a much softer but more delicious sausage. Overall, great place to come for breakfast, brunch, and lunch ... if you haven't been here yet, you should definitely give this place a try for sure!",

This was no problem at all because they had large umbrellas that were out on the deck, they just needed to be opened since the sun was coming out. We waited for our food to arrived and asked the waitress if we could put up the umbrella over our table and she said it was not a problem. She then went and put up all of the umbrellas on the deck which was fine but every time someone looked at her she said \"sorry guys, it's not me, it's them\" and pointed at us. It was the most awkward and unprofessional experience I have ever had at a restaurant. We will not be retuning because we were called out in front of every table on the deck for asking for some shade so we could see our food.  She did not have to put up all the umbrellas if people did not want them up, and she did not have to call us out in such a rude way.",

They have the best the strip has to offer then cranked up the volume which the prices reflect that at an acceptable level.  What keeps me returning to a restaurant is that one good item, a diverse menu that takes me to a different place with each visit or a good deal, aka cheap.  Cafe Raymond has the diverse menu I plan to travel through on each visit.  They also have a great special every day that is not on the menu which is always a great detour.  I also love the counter ordering, makes lunch visits so much more efficient and you are not worrying about paying the bill while you enjoy your meal.  I also feel that this is one of those places that if there is something you usually do not like, you will like it here, basically there is not a bad thing on the menu.",

Eggs over beef brisket hash was excellent. The menu says fried eggs but you can get them scrambled instead. Also ordered the French toast which was a large portion of thick toast drenched in strawberry compote with blueberries. The flavor of the strawberries overpowered everything else. I considered ordering the blueberry ricotta pancakes but I can't eat dairy so I skipped it but it's labeled vegan which I don't understand. Good meal overall.

I ordered two scrambled eggs (5/5), sausage (2/5), wheat toast and their potatoes (0/5).  First I must say kudos to the sous-chef since I believe she made the eggs.  They were cooked *perfectly* without any scorching.  The sausage was in a flattened patty that was overcooked and hard to cut with a fork.  It was pretty nasty and I will not order it again.  The potatoes were even worse; flavorless and dried out.  I believe they make them by the pan and keep them in an oven, sometimes mixing the old pan with the new.  I say this because some were cooked correctly and others were shriveled, black and all moisture was burnt out of them.  Chef Raymond or Management needs to investigate the potato situation because they were a 0/5 in my rating system as well.  Our total bill with drinks was around $25.  $25 for two breakfasts should be astounding food in my opinion.  It was not.",

The food that Ray prepares in his Cafe is 4 star quality. I would put his food on my table before some of the larger restaurants in the area. It does not matter what you order, you will never be disappointed. The food is amazing and the people are even better.  One of the best things about this place has nothing to do with the menu. It that this family is from Pittsburgh. They worked their ass off to make their dreams come True. They have kids that are growing up in their cafe and learning more than a college education could provide. This is the American Dream, in our own YINZER backyard!    I make special trips to Cafe Raymond with my own family. The warmth and community that you feel the minute that you step inside is priceless. I can't even tell you enough about the food--you will have to try that for yourself.  When in doubt, ALWAYS SUPPORT an Entrepreneur--especially one from Pittsburgh!",

You can get in and out of here fairly quickly. You order and pay at the counter and then take a number to your table. Food usually arrives within 10 minutes.   I really love the new location. It's much roomier than the last space. Much more seating too!    Now you may think that $10 for a sausage, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich is pretty outrageous. That is, until you experience said breakfast sandwich. There's practically an entire omelet and a half pound of sausage on that sandwich. The lemon ricotta pancakes are also well worth the dough. Yum!   My usual go-to is the ham and Gruyere on a croissant. It's consistently delicious and the croissants are some of the best in town. The side potatoes are less consistent. Sometimes they are perfect, sometimes burnt, and sometimes overly salted. Potatoes are pretty much my favorite food group and a burnt potato is better than no potato so I'm not too bothered by the inconsistency.   I'm always pleased with my experience here. It's a great Strip District restaurant option!",

My wife wanted to be healthy so she decided on the veggie wrap with a side salad and lemon vinaigrette. About 5 minutes after we placed our orders our food came out.  My muffaletta was perfect, they prepared the sandwich on homemade focaccia bread. This was the perfect match for this great sandwich. Inside the bread were two different kinds of olive salads and an assortment of Italian meats and cheese. The best part of the sandwich though was the bread. I am from Philly and bread is huge and almost as important as the contents inside the sandwhich. Cafe Raymond takes pride in their food and you can tell in every bit.  4/5 in my opinion.

Thick, uber moist, not too dense, and they contain ricotta cheese. That's the secret ingredient!   We both had the blueberry pancakes, big fat juicy purple blueberries nestled in those luscious ricotta pancakes.  Too die for.   You get one little cup of syrup, it's a buck for n extra syrup. A little ridiculous.   The orange juice was really wonderful. We both agreed that we were not expecting to be wowed by orange juice, but it was super tasty.   The bacon was thick, perfectly cooked and meaty.   I'm so glad we ducked in to his place. Nice decor, good seating in and out. We ate at a little table on the sidewalk.

We were able to seat ourselves. It being somewhat crowded, we decided to sit outside, which is fine by me because who doesn't enjoy people watching? Haha anyway, we were served in about 15 minutes and I myself was taking back by how pretty the dishes looked. People walking by seemed to agree because our dishes were getting many stares and comments on how good they looked. Luckily for us, we were able to try let and OH MY GOD.

All I know is your attitude and management is missing the boat. More people should walk",

    "text": "Came into Cafe Raymond for a late Saturday Brunch and was initially a little confused. You order at the counter and they bring the food to you, similar to a Panera. The drinks (other than coffee) is self serve. Plus they're BYO ($5 corking fee) and have glasses for champagne & wine.   I had the Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes, cooked light, and the Croissant BLT. The pancakes were incredible, not too heavy, perfect texture and it as accompanied with warm maple syrup. BLT was also delicious, not too heavy - but very filling.   My sister had the 2 eggs with toast and hash browns. She throughly enjoyed it and the hash browns were very tasty. My niece had the BBQ brisket hash. Although I'm pretty sure it was a special as I can't seem to find it on the online menu.  Overall, this was a great experience. I'm excited to continue dining here.",

I ordered a sandwich from the children's menu and after I paid for it I noticed that I was charged for an adult sandwich. I also noticed I was charged additional for getting a different cheese when the menu states choose any cheese you want on your sandwich. When I asked about the kids price, I was told it's the same price as adults just a smaller portion. So why have a kids menu and now your cheating me out if my money cause your charging same amount for less food??? Makes no sense. Then I ask why was I charged for changing my cheese option when menu says I can. Answer, fresh mozzarella is more expensive. Why didn't you tell me that when I ordered. Your menu doesn't say that. Oh sorry. Ridiculous. It's not that I mind paying money for good food if warranted, but give me the facts and let me decide then. These are things that will make me never come back!!",

Thanks to a very nice gentleman already sitting at a table who offered to move, they were able to seat us together.  Most would find the menu delightful, unless you are an 11 year old who just wants cereal.  Nevermind that... that is my personal little crisis (she got toast - wheat as no white was available - and milk; she'll be fine).   The food is gorgeous.  The blueberry ricotta pancakes were no less than divine.  Staff super friendly and attentive.  Many places in the district were way busier than this and I have no idea why.  This place is a must.  So glad I made this local place a part of my out of town experience.    Oh and that 11 year old.  Yeah, she loved my pancakes, too.",

We ordered the Ricotta Blueberry Pancakes and two egg breakfast. First off, they must be serving dinosaur eggs, because it was huge! They had to have added cream or something too, because there was a distinct creamy flavor to them. Very hearty and delicious! It was served with a side of toast, herb dusted potatoes and thick smoky bacon...yummo! The pancakes were like a dream :) Fluffy, sweet and oh so scrumptious! It was like blueberry birthday cake for breakfast. My only complaint was the tight quarter's, but it's old city row house style...not their fault. Service was excellent though, so i will definitely be back!",

Part of the charm is that you usually can get right in and grab a table either inside or outside immediately. And if you sit outside you can even bring your pup! I've enjoyed this cafe for years but especially recently it's become a staple location when I'm going out to breakfast or lunch.   All of the items I've tried have been great. They don't have just standard cafe fare like you might expect, they somehow elevate everything to the next level. Breakfast sandwiches are huge and my family has compared the croissants to ones they had in France. The smoked salmon platter is fresh and a hearty serving of lox. For lunch I usually get the nicoise salad - so many toppings! - and my boyfriend loves the muffaletta sandwich. But everything else we've had is good as well!  My strong advice - skip the greasy diners in the area and get a good meal from Cafe Raymond instead. Just don't go so often that it starts getting lines like the diners do (-:",

The wait time was too long, so we got on Yelp to see what was near by. We choose Cafe Raymond. This was a great place to get brunch. Very cute place with a nice theme. I ordered the Ciabatta & Lox - NY acme salmon, cream cheese, capers, red onion, cucumber, tomato. It was a really good sandwich. Plenty of salmon to accompany the rest of the meal. It also came with a side of breakfast potatoes. I was not expecting much from these but they were great. They were not mushy, which was what i expected. Overall a great find if you are in the Strip District.",

We went to Sunday Brunch after church and arrived at about 12:30 p.m. to almost a full house. It's a long fairly galley style space with the ordering line and kitchen on the left side of the room and a long line of 2-person tables along the right side.   The entire place smelled of delicious bacon when we entered and inspired my husband to order the BLT. I ordered a cup of hot tea and was given a cup of boiled water and shown to the tea station where they had several types of upscale tea bags in various flavors. I chose a traditional Earl Grey and it was a very good cup of tea - they also had lemon, milk and sugar for those wanting to doctor their tea up.   I had read about the fantastic Blueberry Ricotta pancakes and decided I would try those; my husband got the BLT with roasted potatoes on the side and a delicious fresh crunchy dill pickle spear. The pancakes weren't the end-all and be-all of pancakes, but they were quite good. I will definitely be moving on to trying some of their sandwiches next time.   During our time there I had the chance to speak with a couple of the lovely girls who work there and they were both very friendly and helpful. One of the best perks about this place is that they have nice restrooms in the basement with elevator (or stairs) access. This is important for me as I have mobility challenges and stairs are super taxing on me. It's great to find a restroom in the Strip District and especially one for folks who can't do stairs.  I will definitely return to Cafe Raymond as we had a great Brunch meal and an all-round enjoyable experience.",

The Brisket Hash was amazing (coming from a visiting Texan) and the Guys Breakfast, that blueberry ricotta pancake is easily top 5 of things I've had for breakfast, was delicious! Would definitely recommend to anyone looking for great food!",

Sadly, I'm off red meat because his brisket hash topped with two fried eggs looked amazing. I asked for a green pepper, onion and cheddar cheese. I got green, red and yellow pepper, onion and cheddar cheese. Service was awesome, was asked by 3 different servers if we enjoyed our meals. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!",

I like ordering at the cashier station, and then finding a table, the food seems to arrive faster that way.   This is a great spot to breakfast with friends.",

    "text": "Walked in and could smell the beard and cookies baking...Oh so Nice!   If you are looking for an enjoyable meal with food made from scratch with fresh products, this is the place.  The menu has breakfast (I think served until 11am), salads, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered the Prosciutto sandwich that had fresh mozzarella, pesto, olive tapenade, roasted peppers on home baked ciabatta.  Delicious!  The meat and cheese were so good and the olive tapenade and roasted peppers added a wonderful flavor.  The sandwich came with a pickle wedge and some potato chips.  For some reason, this potato chip hound was not a fan of the potato chips.  Not sure of the brand or if in house but think they were bought not make in house.   Someone in our group ordered a salad, that has huge and looked to be very fresh ingredients.    Service was very friendly.  You order at the counter by the door and they give you a number for the food to be delivered.  After delivery, we were asked a couple of times how everything was and the staff seemed to make sure everyone at all the tables and take out orders were happy and received great service.  Cafe Raymond has been on my list to visit for years and will make sure I have a return visit in the near future.",

    "text": "First time eating here and I had a great experience. While scrolling through the reviews, I noticed one of the reviewers took away a star or 2 due to customer service. In his review he said the person working the front counter should explain to people how their process works (you order at the counter and they deliver your food to your table). Well they did explain the process to me when I walked in, so they must read the Yelp reviews and take action to improve the customer experience--so to me that's good. Also it is a cafe not a fine dining experience--so with my expectations of it being a cafe set in place, I personally thought their customer service was great.   The food is fantastic which is the most important part of a dining experience for me. Prices are very reasonable and the food is high quality. I had the Ciabatta and Lox sandwich which came with a side of potatoes. I was seated quickly and got my food quickly. I will return in the future",

    "text": "I was so pleased to grab lunch here after viewing their menu options. There really is something for everyone. I had a veggie wrap and it came in a spinach wrap with a pesto sauce. I cannot express to you how fresh this tasted (after further review, we discovered they make their bread fresh daily)!    The line moved quickly and we were able to grab a table in front of the kitchen. I enjoyed how the inside was set-up and every employee was smiling and friendly. One thing I personally did not like was that my wrap came with Ruffles potato chips. It's a slight pet peeve of mine when delis do this. It's as though you're presenting this amazing meal that's fresh and delicious and you can't do any better than chips. From a bag. It's a desperate cry for help, in my opinion. But I digress....also for my side I was given a delicious pickle. My wrap came with a side salad as well (which came out so fast!), which included a beautiful, homemade lemon vinaigrette on the side. The coffee I added is organic, which was an added bonus for me, and water cups are free with the option of lemon. Breakfast options are available too. I can't wait to come back here- it really hit the spot.",
