Anyone that complains about healthy food choices should know that if you want to eat healthy, you don't eat out. ....and to lower a rating because it is in Pittsburgh? You are ranking the cafe, not the town. Ordered spicy mac and cheese with chicken, chicken fajitas, beef nachos, all very good for bar fare. Drinks are expensive so bring some $$. Servers are top notch and that announcer is a scream......",

    "text": "The Hard Rock Cafe in Station Square offers a brunch buffet on the mornings when the Pittsburgh Steelers have a home game playing at 1 pm. This review is specifically about  their buffet, not the regular menu.  Following the genre of music, I'd say to the Hard Rock Cafe, \"Don't quit your day job.\" Most of the other guests in the restaurant were ordering off the menu, so I'd say its a pretty universal opinion.  For about $16, the buffet was unremarkable. In the warmers, they had premade scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, hash browns, french toast sticks and pierogies. There was a small collection of pastries, muffins, and bagels -- only butter and cream cheese for the bagels. Two cooks helped with omelets -- they had their pans filled with a partially cooked egg and cheese mixture, to which they would add peppers, tomatoes, ham or bacon. The result was a very fast but very dense/flat \"cooked-to-order\" omelet. There was also a bowl of cut up fruit.   Next to the omelets was also some kind of beef roast that would be carved on request. I guess this is what made the buffet \"brunch\" instead of \"breakfast.\"  Basic institutional fare: the french toast was dry (there was some warm syrup you could add), scrambled eggs in big cakes of egg, selection of pastries/muffins very minimal (e.g., two kinds of Danish), no toast, no English muffins, no cereal (hot or cold), no pancakes, no waffles, few bagel toppings. No egg beaters, egg whites or eggs besides omelets/scrambled. The fruit looked (and tasted) like it came from a can with the usual syrup. No other deserts or fresh fruit. The beef was well cooked (i.e., well done) and a bit dry but tasted ok -- it would help if they had knives to cut the meat rather  than just the butter knife provided. Perhaps the one outstanding good thing was the pierogies with onions. If you got the ones on top, they were pretty good. The ones on the bottom of  the warming tray got so hard that you could barely cut them with the utensils.  Service was fine -- the cooks at the buffet were prompt and the servers took away plates and refilled drinks. I don't think they refilled the buffet table -- looks like it got filled in the morning and stayed that way thru game time. I did hear a football trivia game going on in the room next door, if you like that kind of thing.  Be aware of parking -- it's hourly at the east end and a flat $10 \"event\" at the west. If you are there only for the food, go east. Staying for the game, head west.  If you want the Hard Rock menu, I'd say \"enjoy.\" If you'd like something in a buffet before the game (or on Sundays without games), I'd point you to the Grand Concourse just down the block. It's $25, but a lot more for your money.",

Service was slow and the order for a table of eight came out in waves over 5 minutes kind of disappointing.  But maybe it is because I dislike theme restaurants but anyway you don't have many choices for groups in the area and this had seating for 8 so it goes.  One big plus was they gave each person individual bills, and they suggested it so that was a great favor.",

I was tasked over Thanksgiving with finding a joint that we consider to be \"mom-friendly\", since my Mom isn't really a foie gras and fondant kind of lady. I actually hate foie gras too, but you get the idea. I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how good the food was at the Hard Rock Cafe at Station Square. Can you believe it? The fries were great and the music wasn't too loud. This is the best decision when you don't want to go to one of the 7 sports bars the area offers to unhappily wedge yourself in a sea of beer-soaked Steelers jerseys. Big up to the Hard Rock! I almost bought a t-shirt just for the camp factor.",

We were seated much quicker than I thought that we would be and like Bernadette D. said, the music is kept to a good level where you can actually talk to the people at your table.  The food was pretty good.  Of course, the price was a little bit higher than if you went to an ordinary restaurant in a residential area, but you have to expect to pay a little bit more if you are going to the Hard Rock.  The mixed drink that I ordered was very good and the wait service for drinks was quick.  Also, we didn't wait a long time for our food, despite the busy-ness of the restaurant.  Overall, it was a good experience. I'd go back.",

    "text": "I really did enjoy myself here, I am not a diehard Hard Rock Cafe fan, but I was impressed by the service and the food.  When we arrived here, it was a Saturday around lunchtime, we had a small wait to be seated.  Be warned, I believe almost every Saturday they have a band playing on the stage.  If  you are not interested in seeing/hearing the band ask to be seated in the room off of the main dining area or outside.  When we were seated, our drink orders were taken promptly and we were given time to look over the menu.  I know it's a chain restaurant but I think their menu is quite good.  I opted for their Local Legendary burger.  Each Hard Rock has one of these and it is inspired by the host city.  Pittsburgh's Local Legendary was basically a deconstructed pierogi on a burger.  Basically it is their thick burger patty topped with a nice sized portion of mashed potatoes, caramelized onions, melted provolone cheese, and a nice dollop of sour cream.  The burger was so big that I had to cut it half to try and devour it.  The burger is cooked to your liking and comes out with a nice sized serving of seasoned fries and dipping sauce.  Needless to say that the toppings on the burger began to fall off, but that led to a special treat on the plate that I needed to use the fork for.  This burger alone would have me coming back over and over again.  Decor in here is typical for the Hard Rock brand, so if you have the time and the restaurant isn't crowded, you can take your time to look at the items.  If not, just keep coming back over and over again.    Of course there is a merchandise section that sells the typical Hard Rock Cafe trinkets that you come to expect from any of their restaurants.  Eating outside is a nice treat, especially if the fountain is on in Station Square.  Something to note, if you are a diehard Hard Rock Cafe fan, they do have a rewards program that you can use at their restaurants, hotels and casinos.",

This location is always more than accommodating towards myself and my family. I spent my last three birthdays here with my family and most recently they set up the back room for us. The server we had was also great. He made sure we were all taken care of.  Their food is delicious and the prices are just right for the quality. My only complaint is they got rid of my absolute favorite dish from any restaurant. I miss the Honey Citrus Grilled Chicken Salad. It had red onions, oranges, pecans, red pepper strips, cranberries, and blue cheese. Their honey citrus dressing was to die for. They swapped it out for a similar dish called Grilled Chicken Arugula Salad, but it's not as good as the former.",

Went last night with some friends and sat in the dining area. I was worried it was going to be really busy but it wasn't! A band was setting up for later on and it wasn't loud at all. There was a WIDE range of people dining, formal dresses, teenagers on dates, older people, etc. good people watching!   Our waiter, Dom, was pretty cool. He kept our drinks flowing and came by often to check on us. The pulled chicken sandwich was really good, yummy BBQ sauce and the chicken was very tender. We had a bunch of drinks and they have a decent drink menu but I do think some of the cocktail prices are a little outrageous. I know it's Hard Rock but sheesh.   Anyway, we go here every once in a while and will keep going back for sure. I like Station Square a lot and the parking garage makes it easy and convenient to go to (unlike other areas of the city where parking is an annoyance).",

    "text": "Hard Rock Cafe is one of the best places to chill in while at Station Square; it's comfy, stylish, and always has classic rock music vids and songs playing on the TVs they've set up around the place. I've been here for both lunch and dinner and both times I've left ready to go back and eat another meal (which then never happens just due to the fact that Station Square is a bit of a pain to get to and park in); it had been a few years between my only two visits here, though, so I'm wondering if they changed the menu up since I last ate here. I seem to remember the options in terms of food being a bit smaller during my first visit.   Well, either way, I was happy to find such a varied menu when I returned - burgers, salad, delicious looking sandwiches, fish - my table easily sat in silence for ten minutes just mulling over what we wanted to eat. I settled on a Goat Cheese Chicken Salad Sandwich. I can't say this is something I've seen served at many other places, and it was really, really good. Very unique. It went well with my fantastic berry margarita.   However, an important note about making dinner plans based on my personal preferences - if possible, when you visit or make a reservation, ask in advance if there's going to be a show during your meal. Not so much because the show will be bad and you'll need to avoid it - I mean, it IS called the Hard Rock Cafe - but because, well, if you're looking for a restaurant to just sit, eat and chat with friends, then you need to be prepared for the fact that the Cafe will soon transform from a nice place to do exactly that into a noisy distracting high-class bar. This nearly happened to my group; we had gone to this place specifically to celebrate a friend's birthday, but any time someone tested the mics we couldn't even hear ourselves think. We ran out just before the show started.  But really, I can't hold that against the Cafe, and overall it really is one of the nicest chains to eat at in Pittsburgh. Now maybe I'll find the motivation to make my way back to Station Square to eat here again sooner rather than later.",

If you are one of those people that has to have a Hard Rock Cafe T from every place you go then I guess this is the place for you, otherwise, the food is over-priced for the quality.  There is a nice view of the dancing fountain if you are sitting outside.  There are much better restaurants in Pittsburgh where I would rather be.",

The fountain was in time with the music being played, there were just enough kids enjoying the fountain to make it enjoyable to watch them without it becoming distracting, the air temp was warm, the sky was clear . . . simply a fantastic way to conclude the day!",

On Friday, I had the pleasure of spending the afternoon with my 2 year old niece. For some reason, Hard Rock was my first choice (mostly because I planned on the incline & Mt Washington as well).   The hostess and server were so kind and sweet. They made sure my niece felt like a princess (I believe Jess was our server). We enjoyed dinner outside and loved the views of Pittsburgh. My niece also loved seeing the birds that stopped by for a visit near HRC :)   We shared the chicken club sandwich which comes with fries and it was yummy. The fries weren't too hot (same as my last visit) but hey nothing's perfect. We still enjoyed our meal & my niece enjoyed eating dinner in the big city. Jess even made sure to write a note on our bill to enjoy our afternoon.  *Thanks for a great memory with my shining star, HRC.",

    "text": "I don't want to get off on a rant but:  I can remember in the '90's when going to a Hard Rock was actually cool.  Awesome memorabilia, prices that were steep but not over the top for acceptable food, a good mix of actual rock music and overall it was a decent experience.  I don't know what the hell happened but maybe ten or so years ago the bottom dropped out and quite honestly you've got to have multiple screws loose to actually enjoy eating here.  So we came two weeks ago and I got sucker punched by the lovely children who think the Hard Rock atmosphere is cool even though both really aren't big fans of the food.  Couple that will the stupid 15% off coupon you get from doing the Duck Tour next door and they got another sheeple in the door.  (Baaaa)  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrooPPLtK9pg&s=4002cffbc4e5e9612c5ecc0c1ab84e143c6180c07807faedfb40dd993d8abbfe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=rooP...</a>  The service was a miss as we waited a good ten plus minutes just to have our drink order taken and then another five to seven to have it brought to the table plus a good five to seven more to actually get to the ordering stage.  So that makes around 20-25 minutes just to get the order placed.  At Ruth's Chris I get that because of the pomp and circumstance of the experience but at a Rock Hard?  Really?  Speaking of the drinks, so after our server \"M\" drops off the drinks we immediately smell something coming from the kids cups and it's not good.  They ordered apple juice and the color was off, the look was slightly congealed and the taste well.....let's just say if you stuck a bottle of apple juice on the sidewalk in downtown Phoenix for a week and then served it you probably would get that level of a rotten-spoiled smell.  Of course \"M\" initially instead of apologizing for her/the bartender's screw up insisted that it was merely \"a little salty.\"    Salty my ass, the stuff was down right putrid and never should have been served.  That led into another lengthy search to see if any other juice could be found only in the end, Viola, more apple juice of the non-skunked variety mysteriously appeared.  Eventually after about an hour the drinks and food finally hit the table.  Talking about the food here is mostly irrelevant as it's grossly overpriced for what it is.  I mean if you took off maybe 15-20% then things would be closer to fair but when you're talking about $15 dollar salads & burgers there is nothing that a place like this can serve that's going to give you any ROI in return for your dining dollars.  And as for the music, I've noticed the recent trend at other HRC locations in Baltimore, Orlando & Atlantic City where there's not a whole lot of rock being played at the Hard Rock.  Unless of course you count Blondie, Madonna, Gwen Stefani and Chic as rock.  No thanks as I ain't No Hollaback Girl.  Overall the food is probably a C+ or a B- but when you bring in an F for prices that brings the grade down closer to a D in that department and the service was a clear F for \"M's\" brain dead attempt to serve rotten apple juice while spending more time calling it salty than actually apologizing/fixing the problem/greasing my palm for the long wait and inconvenience of the entire drink experience.  No Mas on any HRC in the future.  Blech!",

We wondered in here on a Friday night expecting a wait but were greeted with a half empty restaurant. We were taken to the back of the restaurant, past multiple unoccupied tables, and seated in the back corner away from everything. We were told our waitress would be there in a second. About 20 minutes later, after asking the hostess if we had a waitress, she shows up and rudely greets us with \"what do you guys want to drink?\". We all ordered water and another 15 minutes passed before we received the water. We decided to place our orders then with expectations it would take a decade to receive. We weren't disappointed as it took well over 30 minutes for the food. After such a wait you would expect fine dining worth of only 5 stars... we were disappointed again. The food was average at best and the chicken tenders were more of breaded chicken pancakes. The fastest part of our night was receiving the check which wasn't shocking at all. We will not be returning to this establishment any time we're in Pittsburgh again.",

Service was very slow, had to chase down a hostess to a waitress to someone to check you out. It's ok. Go sit outside if you want nice view of Station Square.",

She kept walking by but had yet to refill my beverage(bout 10 minutes empty). Dinner came before  I received a refill.  She continued to do her stare at us as she walked by and my fiance wad in need of a drink too be this point.  She never asked if he wanted another beer until we were finished with dinner.    The food was delicious this time.  The pulled pork was so tender. The mac n cheese with chicken was delicious too.  The food is the only reason we are giving 2 stars.   We will definitely not be back.",

    "text": "Man, was I prepared to give Hard Rock Cafe a middling review. I kept thinking of other theme restaurants like Planet Hollywood or Marvel Entertainment's and WWE's forays into this business and therefore didn't expect to give The HRC more than 3 stars.   Blame it on Y&T, who put on a stellar set here this evening, along with strong local bands Dofka and Icarus Witch. I would have never come here if it wasn't to see a show.   It's a good thing we came hungry or I would have never tried their food.   They should just call their Legendary 10 Oz. Burger a frickin' Slayer Burger, for it is the heaviest burger on Earth.   I turned it into a Nile by adding guac for an extra charge, and I didn't care because it damn near blew my head off with its quality.  Real Men Play On Ten...And Eat 10 Oz. Burgers.  Manowar reference. I'm guilty again.   It even came with this huge knife. Why? To kill it first?  Of course it also had lettuce, tomato, pickles, cheddar and that newfangled onion ring business on it along with mayo on the side.  Mayo + Guac on a Burger= RAWK!!!!  The fries it came with were as tight as Opeth's rhythm section.   I forgot to ask for ketchup, so I dipped my fries in the spare mayo and guac. I'm Aquarian like that.   The encore consisted of a Hot Fudge Brownie. If you read my reviews, you know how discerning I am about these things. They use Haagen-Dazs, which already impressed me. The hot fudge and brownie further exceeded my expectations as did the chocolate sprinkles.  What I wasn't prepared for was that heavenly whipped cream! It looked...different, as if it didn't come from an aerosol can. Upon tasting it, I knew I was eating the greatest whipped cream ever. It... whipped my ass.  I asked Alex, our most excellent and strapping dude of a server (does he double as bouncer?), about it, and he confirmed my suspicions. According to him, they use real heavy cream. In fact, he went on about everything else they make from scratch; our brownie was on that list.   You don't normally run into waiters at chain restaurants who are passionate and knowledgeable about good food. The man was proud of the cuisine he serves, and I appreciated him sharing that with us. Very, very cool.   You get the horns, brother. \\m/   My only complaint is that the prices are a bit steep. My girlfriend only got a cobb salad (generous portion though, and she couldn't finish it), and our bill was $42!!! But as Alex explained, this ain't pre-fabricated, frozen crap they're putting out, and they do everything up BIG like a KISS concert. Still, I can see how people would find the fare here to be somewhat overpriced. It's not like we ordered filet mignon, lobster, and Baked Alaska.   Anyways, enough about that. Scratch whipped cream, children, with real HEAVY cream yet. Local ice cream parlors, read and learn.   Now for the live musical experience.   The sound is terrific. There are even booths off to the side if you want to eat while you watch the show. My only gripe in terms of watching a concert here is that the venue itself is just a bit small and cramped. Despite that, we had a great, melodic hard rockin' time. This is a pretty nifty place to catch a gig with all that rock memorabilia decorating the walls. Just be prepared to let the moths out of yer wallet.   If RPM's in Bridgeville went upscale and became a franchise, you'd have The Hard Rock Cafe.",

Typically, one goes to the Hard Rock for the experience, for the venue, for the music, and for fairly decent bar food. On the contrary, my experience here this weekend was all about the good food. I had the vegetarian burger, which can equipped with portobello mushroom, a huge grilled red pepper as well as some other grilled veggies. The flavor was incredible- I'm sure that I tasted a hint of steak sauce. At first, I bit into the burger and I thought the portobello was actual steak (I'm a vegetarian, so I was somewhat worried)- that was how good the flavor was. The fries were well above par as well, along with the coleslaw, which I typically don't even like. The service was not great and everything was overpriced ($13 for veggie burger and fries and $3.50 for a soda), however I need to let them off the hook because it's Hard Rock and the food definitely rocks! I'm not in Station Square often, but I need to stop in here again.",

    "text": "One of my best friends was curator for the hard Rock Cafe in San Diego.  Prior to the opening of the restaurant, he was responsible for inventorying, cleaning, and deciding where to hang all of the priceless memorabilia.  It was early 1989, a few months after Mr. Roy Orbison passed away, and the restaurant had received one of his guitars, signed of course.  The instrument was particularly valuable.  One evening I got a call from my friend, let's call him Bill A.  Bill was a bit panicked because he had done something very bad.  While cleaning the famous rocker's guitar, he had inadvertently wiped off the autograph.  So, what does one do when making such a catastrophic mistake?  Well, you go out to Office Depot, purchase a like-colored pen, and try your best to duplicate the autograph.  So, all these years later, this slightly-less-valuable guitar still hangs on the wall of the San Diego's hard Rock Cafe.   I recently had the opportunity to dine at the hard Rock Cafe in Station Square with a friend.  The large restaurant had pictures of famous musicians were all over the place- old faded leather jackets from famous rockers, electric guitars, and other musical instruments hung on the wall.  Music was blaring over the loud speakers (80's tunes!) but my dinner companion and I had no problems having a conversation. Our waitress visited our table with a smile, and was pleasant and professional. We both started with Caesar salads, which arrived within minutes.  I love romaine, and anchovies... always have, but this was no ordinary Caesar.  Black olives and large bacon chunks lay atop the thickly dressed salad.  At first I was taken aback, but quickly smiled as I tasted the smoky pork-parmesan concoction.  The leaves were drenched with dressing, and there were even a few black olives in the mix.  Thick croutons completed the salad- it was delicious and satisfying. Our entrees arrived - she got the shrimp fajitas, I ordered a California burger.  The fajitas were fairly straightforward; large, plump shrimp served with sauteed peppers, sour cream, cheese, tortillas, and guacamole.  Everything looked good except the guac was a bit brown- blech. My burger came with guacamole, ranch dressing, cheese, and french fries.  Unfortunately, the burger was over-cooked, and cool.  The beef was unseasoned and lacked flavor.  The fries were doused with salt and pepper, and were crispy and brown.  On a scale of one to 10, the burger was at best a four. The best part of our meal was the miniature chocolate mousse at the end of our meal.  It was just big enough to satisfy our sweet tooth, but not big enough to make us feel as if we had over-eaten.  Creamy, and rich with chocolate flavor, it was the perfect ending to our meal. The hard Rock Cafe in Station Square is a hip, fun restaurant to visit, but the food is mediocre.  If you have some out of town guests take them anyway; it's fun to look at all of the memorabilia, and take a walk down by the river afterwards.",

If you have the chance to be taken care of by Zoo, Angel and some of the veteran staff there, you will have a great experience, learn a few things and leave happy. Some of my favorite dishes here are ANY of the burgers, Twisted Mac and Cheese, the smoked/grilled wings if they have them and their signature brownie dessert.   FYI - totally get your mixed drinks/beers in a souvenir glass. The big glasses are like 22oz and the refills are super cheap. It may seem expensive, but when you get down to it... I am a klutz and always need cool glasses to drink out of at home.  If I have to take a glass home, to get a cheaper drink.... I just need my arm pulled just a teensy bit.",

With the exception of different T-shirts, pins and other items in the gift shop. I will say that the fries were better than other HR Cafe's I've been to, except in Amsterdam. Those are hard to beat. I will say that the burger was very good. Super juicy meat patty though I wasn't thrilled with the bun.",

Chris Knight - August 11, 2016  I'm really torn between 3 and 4 stars.  On one hand, excellent staff; we didn't want for anything. At one point, we asked for water and received free bottles. The three of us did run up a $170 bar tab in 2 hours, so this was a nice courtesy - shows the staff is paying attention to their customer needs.   The bathrooms are immaculate and the sound was pristine (acoustic show).   But, I'm used to rowdy venues where beer bottles are whizzing past my head and the concertgoers are moshing. Hard Rock as a concert venue was a little too corporate, too sterile (a little too expensive) and I'm afraid I might lose some street cred writing so favorably about it.   The one issue I have is the venue must have sat dinner patrons up to a certain time because there were a lot of kids and older people wandering around, in and out of the bathrooms and down the ramps (generally people who wouldn't attend a Chris Knight show). It felt like going to my nephews' birthday party where alcohol is served, but you can't get drunk in front of the kids and grandparents. Overall, it restrained my rowdiness a little.",

    "text": "My vote is always to go for a local establishment over a chain restaurant. However, we came here this past Friday evening around 7:30'ish for a friend's farewell dinner. And surprisingly, we did enjoy our food and drinks better than expected.  Since the weather was somewhat windy we opted to stay inside in the separated dinning area since we were in a large group of about 12. Our server was friendly, prompt and very accommodating to our requests.   For such a big establishment, I didn't feel like they had much of a beer selection but what they had was good enough. Since most of the yelpers were raving about the \"Legendary Burger\" - I went with the medium rare (the only way to go IMO)  and my S.O. ordered the shrimp/chicken fajita. A vegetarian in the group ordered the \"Veggie Leggie\" which I was told was not too appetizing. The Legendary burger I ordered tasted great. Juicy with a couple strips of crispy bacon on top. Can't go wrong with bacon... The portions or at least the \"cheese/veg fillings\" and the \"tortilla\" for the fajita was just a bit more than my S.O. could handle.  I believe, the band started playing around 9 and could get pretty loud if you're dinning inside in the main/bar area. Overall, we all had a great time. The food and the service was good. The location is great! And since the three river trail passes through station square - so perhaps, a future pit stop for some food and drinks might just happen this summer.",

The bar is very tiny.. that surprises me every time I visit.  I was celebrating a friends birthday over the weekend. She has never been to the Hard Rock so we went.  $8.75 for her cocktail and $10.95 for nachos.  I know it's the Hard Rock so one would expect the prices to be above average.. ok that's cool but for nachos.. hardly had anything on them.. very little salsa..  it was 75% chips!  I included a picture.   It's fun to pop in for  a drink but that's about it. Its way to expensive and not a great venue to see a band in (unless you have reserved seating maybe).",

    "text": "First let me start by saying that I have been to 25+ Hard Rock Cafes and am a bit of a fanatic!  However, this one just didn't quite met my expectations.  I came for a Dave Matthews cover band that was playing outside on a Friday night.  When I came into the cafe, the hostess said the patio was full and that she wouldn't even put me on a waiting list because everyone on the patio was there for the concert and wouldn't be leaving.  After some argument, I finally convinced her to put me on a waiting list and \"magically\" a table opened up about 10 minutes later.  My sister and I wanted to drink Sangria so we figured it would be cost-friendly to get the pitcher.  The pitcher had a ton of ice and wasn't full to the top so we only got 3 glasses out of it and it ended up costing us more than if we would've just bought 3 individual glasses.  I ordered one of the local dishes - the pierogies and kielbasa.  These were overpriced but good, other than the fact that they were sitting in a pool of grease or butter.  I asked for a side of sour cream (which I was surprised didn't automatically come with pierogies) and they tried to charge me $1.80 for it when my bill came.  I wanted to use my rewards card, which they tried to tell me had expired, even though it hadn't.  The atmosphere is great and the concert was very entertaining, but it seems that the staff may be under-trained.",

Visiting a Hard Rock, I generally order the same thing every time on my first visit & they nailed it - the Honey Mustard Grilled Chicken.    Some fun mementos from rock & roll history, of course - boots owned by The Edge, a Pittsburgh Steelers' themed guitar, Eddie Van Valen's guitar from a show in the city & tons more.  The service was fast, friendly & efficient & a visit to the Rock Shop after my meal did do a bit of damage to my wallet.  If I return to Pittsburgh, I'll definitely be back.",

She informed us of the vegetarian options, but we were there for burgers! Before, she left the table she stated \"Your server today is Josh and you'll love him.\"  Typically, when someone from the restaurant compliments their fellow worker it's just \"part of the process.\" But, this time she was spot on.  Josh came to the table and introduced himself to our table. He allowed us to place our drink orders and gave us ample time to order our food. We did not feel rushed in the process. He even gave a great recommendation on The Big Texan sandwich with pulled pork ( I was there for a burger).   Not once did we have to ask for refill or any extra napkins. Josh was always one step ahead.  He brought plenty of condiments for our orders and informed us that he likes for people to enjoy there food and would check on us periodically.  Not once did our table ever question where Josh was or needed anything additional.   At the end of our lunch we asked to speak to the manager Courtney. Josh was curious but got her anyway. When she came out we asked Josh to stay. We spoke on how our experience was the most pleasant because Josh was the best and he needed to be recognized. Courtney thanked us and said that Josh wasn't going anywhere and that she was glad to hear how our experience went!   The food was cooked perfectly, fries were well-seasoned and the burger was done to perfection (way to go kitchen staff). All-in-all if you're looking for a good place to lunch, come here and ask for Josh! Tell him I sent ya!",

The food is pretty good, nothing super special, but consistent in flavor. I ordered The Texan, a bbq pulled pork sandwich with fried onion straws and jalapenos and cheddar cheese. It was a good sized sandwich with plenty of meat and toppings. The bbq sauce sort of overwhelmed the rest of the flavors, which I found somewhat disappointing. The dish also came with coleslaw, beans, and fries. The coleslaw and beans were average, the fries were too salty and some were a bit soggy. Overall, prices are also higher than I would expect for the quality of food and options in comparison to other restaurants that serve similar menu items.",

We had a large party; mainly consisting of children (normally people would run away from) but Emily handled it remarkably. We asked for seating for 11 outside and at first; the original staffers jumped right on it. They were moving tables and everything to get our large party accommodated and then it seemed like they just disappeared.   My husband went to investigate and here comes our hero: Emily L. She came over very pleasant and energetic; ready to take care of us. She was patient (we didn't take up a whole lot of time but still) with the children and even going above and beyond.   We asked her about some local sights and she was ready to get the info even when she didn't had the answer for us. Just top notch.   Now to the food  everything was delicious. It was lunch time; but I didn't eat too much. We ordered children's meals (which come on a guitar plate which the children absolutely loved). They were nicely portioned. It's a gamble for us when order for our 10-yr old off the children's menu because he can eat like an adult; but he was satisfied. So thumbs up   Husband and I ordered the jumbo combo appetizer. Yummy. Good portions. I like the fact that you can choose the flavor of wings you get; normally it's preset so that was nice.   I forget the cool memorabilia Hard Rock has. I saw a robe Elvis wore in one of movies; we saw a keytar Stevie Wonder played; a guitar from the Motley Crew; Michael Jackson jacket; It was cool.   Oooo let me not forget the manager!!! I can't remember his name but I know that he was from the Baltimore location training in Pittsburgh. He was great, friendly; made sure we had everything we needed. Had a nice little chit-chat because we're all from Baltimore and he was letting us know about some exciting things happening there, so we can't wait to get to the Harbor and check out that location.   Everyone really enjoyed Hard Rock. If we're ever back in the Pitts; we'll definitely stop by.",

It was delicious. The bacon on it was cooked crispy and I liked the Honey mustard sauce on it. The fries were great! I did not care for the cole slaw though. My husband got the Texan and he enjoyed that as well. We also ordered a kids meal pizza and my son ate it pretty well. Kids pizzas always come out way too hot though so they can't eat right away and the cheese melts off.  We were part of a large party, 19 of us. They had us sitting in the back and it was nice because we were in almost our own area. The tables could have been set up better. They were different sizes and awkward. Also it would have been nice to have one more table. We were a bit cramped sitting there.  Our waitress was really nice and I think did a good job for taking care of all of us by herself.",

Since we were traveling as a large group, we had pre-selected meal options which were provided on a limited  menu. Our group arrived slightly early due to weather rearranging or schedule for the day.   Pros: -Food was served quickly with very short wait times for meals to be served. -Service was efficient and organized -Food was okay -Excellent atmosphere, views and fountain outside... Also located in a great area.  Cons: -Unclean silverware brought out twice, server finally returned with plasticware (not by request) -The attitude of our server was abismal. She was short with our group from the time of entry. Her attitude was truly among the worst that I've ever encountered when dining out. All requests made were dismissed abruptly.  -Was initially brought out the wrong burger, even though a veggie was ordered -Wasn't even offered a refill of drinks  With a city full of local staples, this is probably not on the top of the list. Especially considering the prices and service issue. Will avoid in the future and suggest that you do too.",

It should have been a quick in-and-out, but it ended up being a long and disappointing visit. We've visited several Hard Rock Cafes in the past, and this one just did not live up to our expectations.   The drink I ordered was off their menu, so perhaps that was the problem. It was weak and way too sweet. When I told the bartender, they looked at me like I was speaking a foreign language. Rather than debate it, I just kept it and moved on.  My husband ordered a flavored lemonade, and he said for the price it was super disappointing as well. Seems like just plain old Minute Maid with a few squirts of flavoring. Definitely not worth it.  I'm sure we'll keep frequenting Hard Rocks in our travels, but if we're in the Pittsburgh area again I don't anticipate making this one a priority.",

We ended up sitting criss-cross apple sauce in front of the stage until it started because there was nowhere else to be.  The show itself was good-- seemed like they were having some technical difficulties with the sound for a while, but Taz and the opening acts were awesome.  We left at 11, which is when most concerts in Pittsburgh wrap up, although Taz was still going strong. Maybe shows end later here because it's a bar/restaurant, not a dedicated music venue.",

But Pittsburgh is now my city and I gotta love the Pittsburgh HR so much so we went there on Christmas Day its was nice and quiet  our waitress was super friendly and very attentive its diner type food (Mac n cheese, nachos ) they have special fruity drinks in glasses you can keep  yup all the touristy stuff  but in all honesty their burgers are really good  their shakes are awesome and I used to finish off with their chocolate cake but alas no longer on the menu so the brownie sundae does just fine and if your in the mood their shakes are the bomb yup I love Hard Rocks  if I had to think hard I have been to over 30 HRs  go enjoy the place with a light heart  watch classic rock videos  and all is well in the HR world",

There was still confusion when we went to sit down because we were 1 seat short.  Once we were all settled the rest of the time went very well. I ordered the Texan, my husband got the Chicken Sandwich, and we got the noodles with broccoli for my daughter. I can only speak for the Texan. It was delicious. I would definitely order it again. The jalapenos gave it for the perfect kick.  There was only one waitress for our party of 19 but she did a great job with such a demanding group.  My only real complaint was the back area they had us in had the air conditioning blasting. It was freezing! Other than that it was great.  Note: if you do a just ducky tour you get 15% off your meal/beverage at hard rock and 10% off the gift shop at hard rock.",

There was that time in the 90s when people seemed weirdly obsessed with getting Hardrock Cafe t-shirts from different cities, which makes the whole idea feel somehow dated.   Our server was very friendly and attentive. She even suggested a few drinks and items that were no longer on the printed menu, but still available.   I ordered the California Cobb Salad. It was fine, nothing really special. While I enjoyed the addition of the pomegranite seeds, the large cubes of cheese felt out of place and more difficult to eat than the rest of the salad.   My friend ordered a burger which he described as \"A burger. I don't expect much.\"",

Hard Rock is very kid friendly... bring the kiddos!  Located in Station Square with loads and loads of activities all around.  We did an early a Ducky Tour and knew we would need to have a place to go that was close by after the tour.  Especially with 3 kids in tow.  Initially we were worried that the Hard Rock might be too loud, however the tour came with a discount coupon for Hard Rock... so off we went.  We were seated in the main dining area.  Lots of tvs around and music memorabilia that you expect here.  Every single staff member said hello to the kids and treated us amazing.  Our waiter attended to them first and made sure each time they were taken care of.  Kids get their own cool guitar plates too.  Seriously I was impressed with all the kid friendly features.  On to the adult stuff... good selection of brews and yes the food was excellent.  I went with the grilled wings (with the spicy rub) and a salad that came with a white balsamic dressing.  I really enjoyed it.  The ladies in our group got buffalo cauliflower as an app, and they loved it.  And that's the thing... lots of options for all different kinds of eaters.  I was really happy and wouldn't hesitate at all enjoying some food and drinks again here.  Again... did I mention how kid friendly they are!! Hope my review moves them up a few spots at least.",

What else is there to do on a Tuesday evening when you are in town on a business trip? We had a great time. The theme was Jurassic Park. Apparently thus location does different themed trivia nights on a regular basis so check out their schedule.   If you frequent Hard Rock cafes, I would suggest signing up for the rewards program. I have received priority seating coupons in the past as well as discounts for merchandise and food.   We shared the jumbo combo appetizer: onion rings, wings, chicken tenders, bruschetta, and southwest spring rolls. It was a nice variety of small bites. But we didn't stop there. We also ordered the cauliflower wings, which tasted just like buffalo wings but with cauliflower. You get all the goodness AND it's healthier, right?!   Good times and good food.",

Place was pretty quiet when we were there, but the music and video selection was kind of odd, it literally went from Shakira to classic 70s at times.

When we first went in we were told that we had to eat outside because the band was doing a sound check. There were other propel eating inside why couldn't we? Anyway once seated our waitress quickly took our drink orders and didn't return for  at least 10 mins! We asked if the restaurant had a allergen menu and we were told No! The waitress did offer to ask about things but seemed bothered by our questions. After we ordered it took forever to get our food . It was ok but not worth the 13 bucks for a cheeseburger and soggy fries. Our waitress only stopped by our table once and said and I quote \" everything is ok here right?\" And took off before we could answer. It's not like the place was even busy! We spoke with the manager after dinner about the service and insisted on discounting the check which was very kind of him. When our waitress  brought our new check we realized she even over charged us for a drink we didn't order! Avoid this Hard Rock! There is much better for and service in station square!

In the future if I wind up at another HRC I will order them with out the beans and sauce because the rest of it was decent. This location was at the Station Square that overlooked the river and downtown Pittsburgh. It was a good location for sitting on the patio and watching a water show that played with the music. Our server wasn't busy so she was overly attentive - to the point of seriously annoying. Overall, it was ok and not a terrible experience.",

One of the managers took his own time to explain a lot of the new menu, and really made you feel welcome.  One the mishap happened, they went out of their way to make it right and even go above and beyond that.  We also witnessed other servers working extremely hard to make patrons visits a good one!

March 2017 Arrived 45 min before the show to eat and get a seat.  Tickets were will-call.  There was no hostess at the door to seat you.  You do not get a table by yourself it is concert seating so they stick you with other people.  They give you a wristband for having purchased a ticket but I looked around and saw at least 10 people without wristbands with better seats than I had.  I believe these people came earlier for dinner and realized there was a show and decided to stay and was never asked to pay.  If they had paid where is the wristband?  This was not a local venue it was Howie Day.  Those people should have been told they needed to leave by 8:00 or purchase a ticket before they were ever seated!  Service sucked took forever to be waited on.  I ordered a red berry press when I got it, it was missing raspberries.  Told waitress she said they were out of ingredients they will run out of stuff cause it's so busy.  Wtf!!!!????  I said you can't serve & charge me for a drink that's missing ingredients that I am paying for!!! She took it back and low & behold they had raspberries imagine that!  Are they skimping to save or forgot?  Who knows.  Not impressed.  Pay attention to what you are served!",

    "text": "My friend and I had tickets to see Corey Feldman on Friday night. We got to Hard Rock at 7 for dinner and then we were going to stay for the 9:30 show, obviously. We were told by the host that all the tables were reserved for the show and that if we wanted to eat dinner, we would have to sit outside. I said, \"what do you mean all the table are reserved, what does that mean?\" He said \"all the tables are reserved and it's standing room only.\" He said there were over 300 tickets sold for the show. Wait, what? I bought tickets for show. At a restaurant. Where they have tables. At no point in purchasing these tickets nor any point afterwards was there any mention whatsoever of there only being a handful of tables and the rest being standing room only. Not only is that completely unprofessional and irresponsible for you not to mention this was a standing room only concert when people are buying tickets, but you guys are making the assumption that everyone who buys a ticket for this show has the ability to stand for a prolonged period of time which is absolutely asinine. If a show is being sold as \"standing room only, first come first served with tables\" then I show up and have to stand, that is on me. My fault. I knew it was a possibility. But when I purchase tickets at a restaurant I expect to have a seat reserved and once the tables are filled the show becomes sold out. I need to mention at this point, we know someone who has been to several concerts at Hard Rock and has NEVER had to make a reservation. Once we were in the restaurant, it was apparent that the customers who had \"reserved\" tables were friends of the staff and this is the only way that they would have known to make a \"reservation\" since, as I said it most definitely was not told to us. At this point another couple came in after us and heard this conversation and said \" wait, so you are saying we have to stand? There is no way we are standing, there was never any mention of this, we are leaving.\" And they did. Another couple who was browsing the gift shop when we came in also said \"they never disclosed anything like that and they really should have.\" We stuck around for a while to see what the crowd was looking like, but by 9 PM it was clear that my friend, who has physical disabilities and is unable to stand for prolonged periods (she even has a handicapped pass she carries with her but that was deemed unimportant, obviously), was not going to be able to stay. On top of this, I have anxiety of crowds (did I mention there were 300+ people in a tiny room?! It was literally elbow to elbow and there was absolutely nowhere to go), not to mention my asthma in the stifling heat there was NO WAY we were standing for this show for 4 hours. This was a total health issue and not just someone being angry they had to stand and didn't want to. Again, making the assumption that ALL people buying tickets have that ability to stand is not only irresponsible but most likely illegal too. I also have to say, just for the record, I have trouble believing that the amount of people in that place was not against fire code. I do not take leaving bad reviews lightly but this situation was handled very poorly. Upon looking at reviews, after the fact of course, I see this is not an unusual thing. I waited a couple days to let the initial anger calm down prior to making this review, but I truly believe they need to change their practices if they are going to continue holding concerts here. So if my review saves even one person from being cheated the way we were, then I feel my experience was worth something. And please, store manager, do not reply to my review with some boilerplate, canned response or an apology. The best apology (besides refunding me my wasted money which will obviously never happen) would be for you to step up and take control of this in the future and do the right thing by disclosing important information to your paying customers, especially when it is something that can affect their health",

I happened to be standing next to a local sports star when he was attempting to make eye contact so the bartender at least knew he was there and was rudely told that I will get to you.  In a service industry I was pretty shocked at their attitude and even more surprised at a name like Hard Rock, looks to me like you should be blessed to be patronizing their establishment.

When we entered the restaurant we were greeted by a very friendly and welcoming hostess but after that things seemed to go down hill once we had our server.  After looking at the menu I decided to get the grilled chicken salad that had feta, dried cranberries, \"grilled chicken\" and oranges in it.  My husband had the bbq burger which was recommended by the waiter as being the one everyone got.  After waiting almost an hour for our food and seeing everyone around us receive their food the waiter came over to tell us that he had dropped my husbands burger and that they had to remake the burger but mind you he still did not have the food with him.  The waiter proceeded to tell us how sorry he was but that he wanted to be honest with us and not blame the kitchen .  He then continued to tell us some more about his personal situation and apologize some more to the point where it became awkward since we still didn't have our food and what he was saying about his personal life.  Finally our food arrived and neither of us were completely happy with our meals.  After waiting so long and then being told my husbands meal was dropped on the ground we expected the manager could have stopped by.  My husbands burger was a lot smaller than the ones we saw brought to the tables around us and I wasn't thrilled with the grilled chicken on my salad that looked like deli meat.  I mentioned to the waiter that I thought it was supposed to be grilled chicken and the waiter immediately told me he promised me it wasn't deli meat but that it was supposed to make it easier to cut.  Needless to say after this experience we will not be returning.",

    "text": "I do not understand why the Hard Rock Cafe (HRC) is an oft-used venue for bachelorette and birthday parties. WHY? Every single time I go to Hard Rock, there is at least one overdressed table of ladies with phallic hats and party favors wearing buttons that say something like \"team bride.\" As a side note, ladies... just stop it with this crap.  You're not being creative, you're not funny.  Step outside of the bride-to-be box.   That being said, in order to actually get a table at HRC you must wait.  Often long times, too because aforementioned parties take up a great deal of space in HRC's small dining room.   The food is decent but boring.  I've enjoyed their twisted mac n' cheese and large salads. The specialty drinks are way overpriced and have contain little alcohol.  I don't mind expensive cocktails if they pack a bang for your buck (see: Acacia). But HRC favorites like the \"Mosh Pit\" (gin, citron vodka, basil, strawberries) tasted like pureed strawberries and nothing else.  I reluctantly sent it back and swapped it for a beer.   As with most HRCs, they have bands play on weekend nights.  Be aware, if you come for a late dinner then be prepared to either (1) eat quickly or (2) pay the ticket price for seeing the show.  This is all well and good but if you have a party that has waited over an hour to be seated only to be rushed out the door, there is no chance in actually enjoying yourself.    I was prepared to give HRC one star.  Why the two?  Because despite the tourist-trap prices, the long wait times, and overpriced drinks, the Hard Rock hires some very patient and friendly staff. They're really great. So there's that.    Unfortunately the nice waiters aren't enough for me to ever go there on my own volition. You will only catch me there if I'm at a friend's birthday party.  And I am so stealing a few bites of his or her free sundae.",

    "text": "It's official, Pittsburgh has the smallest hard Rock Cafe in the entire chain. But, it's also got one of the best collection of memorabilia of any of them. I've been to many HRC all over the country and even though it's small I think ours is the nicest. The outdoor patio overlooking that great Pittsburgh skyline, the 60 foot black and gold Strat that sits proudly on top of the building, but what I want to know is, what moron traded the famous Studio 54 Sun that sat proudly inside the HRC since it's opening back the the NYC HRC? Silly move!   Anyway the food's gotten better, and they've added a decent veggie burger. Desserts are always a great thing at HRC. and who can pass up buying a famous pin at the gift shop, or proudly wearing a Hard Rock Pittsburgh T shirt when visiting an out of town HRC?",

    "text": "I am giving this location 5 stars because of the customer service.  Our 5 year old son is autistic and loves the band Kiss, he loves to eat at Hard Rock because of the Kiss memorabilia. The staff at Hard Rock is so amazing and friendly.  Our son runs to his favorite table where he has a clear view of the Kiss items and the staff never steers us to a different table.  The food is good too!  But knowing that we have a safe and inviting place to take our kids is the best feeling.  Thank you Hard Rock Pittsburgh for being autism friendly.",

    "text": "Was in Pittsburgh for the weekend (10/22 & 23). Wanted to watch the Steelers game and we were already at Station Square.  First, we went into Buckheads, but the menu was very limited. So, we left to walk across the bridge into downtown and find someplace else, but Hard Rock Cafe is right there so we popped in, made sure the game would be on, and got a table.   First off - our first server was really nice. Very accommodating. I was really interested in trying the Buffalo Cauliflower \"wings\".  But, she came back and said they were out. So, I just went with a Caeser Salad with grilled Salmon.  Had to send it back because the salad was way too salty. I love salt, but this was overkill. I kept the Salmon and even though I ate the whole piece of Salmon, the server took everything off of my bill.  Pretty cool! Her shift was over and we got a new server. He was just as nice and accommodating as the first one. So, really, the servers were not the issue at all.  I waited until the second half of the game and my niece and I decided to share the Hot Fudge Brownie. It looked so damn good on the menu. But, we were gypped. It comes in a very large glass bowl, but there was barely a scoop of ice cream, no hot fudge and an ENORMOUS amount of whipped cream. I mean, really enormous. I'm sure they did that to hide the super small amount of ice cream. And, honest to god, whipped cream is my favorite dessert, but I would have preferred the actual ice cream that should have been in the bowl.  There's even a picture on this page while I'm typing this and ours looked NOTHING like what's in that picture.  Oh, and we noticed that a woman who came in about 40 minutes after we did was able to get the Buffalo Cauliflower Wings.  SMH! The kitchen staff at this one is damaging their business. Now I know why it wasn't very busy.   After eating at a few local restaurants all weekend and being pleased, then settling for Hard Rock Cafe because it was right in front of us, we learned our lesson: next time, we'll stick to the plan and avoid chain restaurants like this one.",

I would think of the quality and price were to change they could really do some business. Guess that explains why there was only 1 table of people in there.",
