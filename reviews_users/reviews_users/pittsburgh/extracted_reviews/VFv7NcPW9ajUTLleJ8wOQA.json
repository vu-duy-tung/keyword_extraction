Staff person taking my order kept spoke so quickly and kept trying to suggest things while I was trying to just say what I wanted.  Becuase of food allergies I just got veggies and beans. When I moved down the line, ( I was going to get cheese) I told the 2nd girl I was reconsidering because the portion was so small, less than 1/3 of a cup it was not worth the price to me. She said she would go back and add more beans (originally maybe 3 TBSP) before I could stop her, she dumped 3 big scoops of beans without much draining, drowning the veggies completly. I told them to forget it I will just get a bag of chips. And...they were terrribly stale.",

Other than pleasing the tastebuds Chipotle meals are extremely healthy filled with herbs, vegetables, healthy carbs...vitamins, minerals and fiber.  they are also a eco-conscious company and use organic and local produce when available.  I love their recent addition of the choice of brown rice instead of white rice.  You can't tell that you are eating brown rice.    If you'd like to keep the meal healthier, I would skip the sour cream, cheese and burrito wrap and pick a burrito bowl.  not trying to be a health freak but you just feel better when you eat healthier.  :)  Pretty much one of my favorite places to get a meal in Oakland even tho it's a huge chain.",

Their cilantro lime rice is sooo good.  You can't deny that Chipotle's business practices are incredible when compared to other businesses. While McDonald's basically controls the quality of beef, even in the grocery store, making sure what we get is cheap and tasteless, Chipotle goes the other direction and makes sure its ingredients are sustainable and free range. It's so easy for a chain to want to do things the quick and dirty way, I commend Chipotle for swimming upstream.  Seriously, their burritos are tasty, they're better than most burritos you can find in the Mexican restaurants dotting Pittsburgh. Don't confuse sustainable and grass fed with healthy, however, one burrito will cost you 1500 calories.",

In any case the quality of the ingredients seems a cut above at Chipotle vis a vis Qdoba, but Qdoba has better overall menu variety and selection.   I agree with the \"non authentic issues as well.\" -- It is owned by McDonalds after all.  However, that said, I am not a culinary anthropologist.  If I was traveling to a far flung destination in Mexico, I would want to make sure that the food I was eating was authentic and True to the \"experience\" I was looking for.  When I am hunter gathering for dinner, I am interested in reasonable prices, and food that it just plain Yummy.  Chipotle qualifies.",

    "text": "I typically visit the Shadyside location, but when I'm in Oakland and need a cheap meal, I'll go to this location. It's Chipotle, so the food is pretty much all the same, but this location is way more hectic than any other. It's almost always very loud and crowded, and it's not as clean as the one I frequent the most.   The staff is typically pretty tired, too. I understand why they are, so I'm not criticizing that aspect. I just feel like they are probably overworked and underpaid. Not surprising, though.  In short, this spot serves its purpose, but if you want a quieter experience, go somewhere else.",

I'd say it's better than Qdoba, but on par with, say, Noodles & Co.  I've patronized this location a few times (albeit not lately).  It's super-crowded at lunch, but the employees are efficient and the line moves fast.  I've only ever ordered the burritos here--which is what they're known for--and they've been fresh and tasty, but nothing worth really going out of my way for (hence the lack of recent visits).  Also, they're a calorie bomb, so think twice before indulging if you're trying to lose weight.  I like the guac, but I don't like the upcharge for it.  If you want something different than the usual options, you can try ordering the secret menu options (e.g., quesorito, nachos). However, I'd recommend doing so on the off hours, so as not to annoy the employees (I haven't tried ordering any of them myself, but I've heard stories...).  If it's the weekend and you want a great taco, I'd recommend walking two blocks up Atwood and patronizing a local establishment (Las Palmas). 3.5 stars.",

The main reason I would recommend Chipotle over the other Mexican restaurants in the area is that this seems to be most students' favorite spot as well. This means that new customers are continuously being served throughout the day which means all the meats were prepared recently. Food is constantly on rotation, so you don't have to worry about ingredients being left out for too long.",

Also due to the location, parking is difficult. You have a better chance of parking in a garage off Forbes than finding a parking spot on Forbes.

At one time the burrito looked like a chicken shawarma wrap with almost no meat and little portions of rise filled with sour cream and beans!!  In another occasion, which was the last for me, they were out of fajitas and chicken! ( I only eat chicken meat).

    "text": "This place for Chipotle is ok. I like to have a decent amount of rice because I like to eat food with at least a 1:1 ratio of other stuff to rice, and sometimes even if I ask for more rice I don't get much. One time when I went the cheese was extremely long, it was like eating noodles of cheese. Another time the lettuce was not cut very well, the pieces were large which made eating them weird. I can see why this happens, during a busy shift they might just want to throw some more cheese or lettuce out there ASAP because there's too much to do but it sucks for the person who has to eat it. The tables are often dirty. The food does taste bomb, but that's the same for all Chipotles and this one is lacking in some areas.  If you are looking to yelp for a recommendation, I like the bowl with hard shell tacos on the side with white rice, black beans, mild salsa, corn salsa (this one has some green stuff in it that is spicy, I try to pick it out but I always have that one bite that makes me want to cry), cheese, and lettuce. The guac is good but not worth the extra for me. For meats, I like chicken the most, then carnitas (has a kind of pulled pork texture), and then barbacoa (same texture as carnitas but more juicy and beefy, a bit spicy if you are weak to spiciness). I am not a fan of the steak at any chipotle, though it is popular.",

    "text": "Fastest and friendliest Chipotle we've been to in the country.   We are in a band (KOLARS - shameless self promo) and we tour all over the country.   Honestly I was blown away with how quick on and point they were.  I had to chuckle and tell them.   They humbly replied \"it's cause we're used to the rush with all the students\".   Nice people.  Love Pittsburgh.   One of the friendliest cities in the country hands down.",
