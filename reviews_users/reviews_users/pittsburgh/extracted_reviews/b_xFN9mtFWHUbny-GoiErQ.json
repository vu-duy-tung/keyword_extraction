I tried the banana walnut crepe pancakes - fresh bananas, walnuts, and whipped cream in a delicate tasty pancake - if you like banana bread - you will probably like this - maple syrup wasn't needed but I used some anyway - it is better than delicious.  The eggs and sausage were good too.  I came for a late lunch during the week and did not have to wait.  Service was efficient.  I enjoyed the ambience of the diner and Walnut street - so much fun to hang out here.",

However, this branch on Shadyside is a nightmare to go to on the weekends. It takes FOREVER to get a table here every time. There are mounds of people that line up on Walnut Street to get a table. After spending the time outside, any food they offer you will sound amazing because your stomach is growling so loudly. Objectively, the food here is good and the dinner decor has a lot of character. However, I stopped going here a long time ago when I discovered that Harris Grill brunch is much more hearty and the wait will at least be half an hour less.",

The waiters/waitresses are very professional about everything. You can tell that they have been waiting tables for a while. The wait for your food is not long once you order.

I decided to get the breakfast special -- sausage, scrambled eggs, and regular hotcakes. I waited only 15 minutes for my order and I overheard one of the managers say that Pamela's was featured in People's magazine. Not sure if it was in a past, latest, or  future issue, but it made me look forward to breakfast even more and I definitely thought it lived up to the hype. I quickly gambled up the sausage and scrambled eggs, but those hotcakes were AWESOME! They were thin like crepes and with butter and syrup, it was drool worthy. On my first bite I literally said, \"Hmmm...\" With the breakfast special, if you pay an extra $2, you can get one a stack of the specialty hotcakes (blueberry, chocolate chip, strawberry, or banana walnut).  The only downside of this place is that it is cash only.",

That's a lot of money for eggs and pancakes!!  We were a little overwhelmed when we first arrived because the waiting area was packed. They told us only 10-15 mins and it was spot-on, which we were pleasantly surprised about! Our server came to us right away. I could immediately see how fast-paced they work to keep their customers flowing on a busy morning!  Everyone in my group would agree that the best part of the meal was the lyonnaise potatoes. My friend recommended asking for the potatoes to be \"crispy\" and I'm glad I did. They were absolutely delicious. A crunchy coating on top with soft potatoes and onions underneath. YUM.  I ordered the Gail's eggs which were scrambled eggs topped with green onion and cream cheese. It came with a side of potatoes and two gigantic pieces of bread. The eggs were done perfectly and I although I had never had cream cheese on eggs before, it was delicious!! It's going to be hard to avoid cooking my eggs like that from now on! One of my friends ordered the breakfast special with 2 eggs, meat and a side of their specialty blueberry hotcakes. It falls somewhere between a crepe and a pancake. They cook a giant pancake and roll it up over a variety of fillings. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious! If it's too sweet to order for your whole meal, it's definitely worth ordering as a side for a few to split just to get a taste! My other friend ordered a daily special which was Chorizo hash served with eggs and tortillas. There was a surprising amount of meat and he was very pleased with his meal as well.  The food is great and I was happy to finally experience this Pittsburgh gem. Prepare to pay more than your typical diner, but you certainly won't be disappointed by the quality!",

Came here for breakfast while visiting family in the area and really enjoyed the meal. Only draw back is parking sucks the lot is ridiculous and street parking is hard because of the traffic. Also cash only.. sort of annoying.. but would totally go back and recommend to all .",

This was my first stop in Pittsburgh. Apparently Obama has dined here and this was the place to be. I didn't actually do my own research, just let my friend guide me along.   The hotcakes are no doubt delicious. They are like huge crepes filled with your choice of fruit pretty much and a ton of whipped cream. We actually shared one banana walnut hotcake and it was plenty. Definitely a great deal. We could've just ordered that and been full. However, we also ordered the corned beef hash. This  was an extremely heavy dish. It was also really salty. It comes with toast too.   Huge portions, delicious food, great prices. That's definitely where the 4 is coming from. For me, the food was just too heavy and buttery, so much so that I don't know if I would come back.  Personally, I prefer my fluffy, fruity pancakes. With all that said - If you're visiting, it is still worth a stop.",

My brother took me and my mother to Pamela's for brunch and it was pretty packed. Fortunately, it was only a 10 minute wait and a huge crowd came in after us. I glanced through the menu and learned that they're known for their specialty hotcakes. They all looked very good, but settled on the the strawberry hotcakes (was craving strawberries). We finally got seated, ordered what we want, and chilled in the lively atmosphere of the diner. The food came out relatively fast and I was ecstatic for my hotcakes. They use FRESH strawberries instead of the syrupy strawberries in a can! The hotcakes were thin like a crepe and the crispy edges were the best part. A bit heavy on the butter, but that's how you get the crispiness. The sour cream surprisingly worked well with the strawberries, as it balanced out the sweetness from its tart element. As for the brown sugar, that was like the cherry on top. It was pure harmony.  Definitely check it out when you're in Pittsburgh!",

    "text": "So many great reviews.  Friends who live or have lived in Pittsburgh rave about this place.  It was supposed to be THE PLACE for breakfast and brunch in this city.  I first visited this place on a short Pgh Apt hunting trip back in April 2013.  Went in, got excited, as the place was packed with people.  It had the classic diner feel.  It had to be good.  Sadly, it wasn't.  Not wanting to give up hope, I went back to Pamela's the next day, and went with the corned beef hash, since many yelpers had mentioned it.  Again, disappointed.  Having settled in Pgh for a few months now, I decided to give Pamela's a third chance recently.  *sigh.  I don't get how this place has such high yelp ratings.  Food = (6.5/10) = As mentioned above, my first visit I tried the western omelet.  It was just ok.  Not well seasoned, and the cheese was meh.   Quantity wise, you do get a huge amount of food for what you pay for.  Second trip was the corned beef hash trip.  Really don't understand what is so great about this dish.  My third trip I tried the tex-mex omelet.  Again, eggs under seasoned, and cheese was meh.  What bothered me the most was the \"guacamole.\"  It's more like avocado paste with mayonnaise consistency.  Like something you would squeeze out of a toothpaste tube. Texture was not appealing.  The friend who came with me on this third trip ordered the pancakes, which he thought were fine.  Ambiance = (7.5/10) = it's got the classic diner feel, with diner friendly waitresses/waiters.    Service (8.0/10) = as mentioned above, the classic diner friendly environment.  Overall opinion = I wonder if those who give high ratings to this establishment, are the locals of Pgh, and college/grad students on a budget and naturally appreciate the large quantities of food for cheap prices.  This place is just ok for me.  I'm still searching for my go-to-brunch place in Pittsburgh.  I do recommend trying this place out and making your own judgement, especially if you've just moved to the area.  There is always a wait to get in on weekends, so they must be doing something right.  Place is cash only.",

We were trying to go on a nice early breakfast date as a 2-person party and got seated next to another person at a 4-top table. We raised our concerns with the host, but she just walked off.  Sure, the place is busy, but did you have to seat us shoulder-to-shoulder with somebody on one side, and employees brushing past us with food on the other? We were practically in the kitchen area and kept getting bumped into or brushed up against, all while being shoulder to shoulder with another party (they bussed the table and put another 2-person party at our table after the first person left).  We made it clear to the server that we wanted to move to another table, but she seemed to shrug it off with stuff like \"oh, yeah, this is an old school diner, the tables are bolted down!\" I said \"well, I think that we are going to be leaving, if we don't get re-seated somewhere else.\" After it was clear that we were going to be sitting with strangers while being bumped into or brushed on by employees, we just got up and left to get breakfast somewhere else where we could have some space.  While we were on our way out, we were walking past about a dozen other 2-person parties who had their own 4-top tables that they weren't sharing with another party and not getting in the way of employees going back and forth from the kitchen.  I wish that either the host or server took our concerns more seriously, and moved us to another table. We would have stayed if it wasn't for the complete disregard for our preferences. I don't think that we were asking for too much, especially since many other 2-person parties were able to sit at their own tables, away from the kitchen area.  The previous time I was here, we did enjoy the food, but found the cash-only policy to be an inconvenience, as well as the general hustle and bustle going on all around us. It was fine though, and I'd rate my first visit a 4-star experience.",

I remember being at the Shady side location when I was about 12 and looking around at every one's plates. The portions were ginormous!! Even when I went last week the portions were still giant, though I had grown a good bit. I love their staple of amazing homemade pancakes, crepes and other breakfast wonders!   My plate was about a foot around and piled as you could see. My meal was daunting and exciting. It smelled of warm cinnamon and buttery toasted caramel. Each bite was delicate, creamy, and cooked to perfection. There were moments where I'd get a bit more of the caramel and the sweetness would ting my teeth, that was quickly stopped by the nutty whipped cream and creamy egg base of the toast.   I will definitely be back! Feel free to check out the rest of my review. Heres my post Pamelas Diner and the best french toast I've ever put in my body.

    "text": "There is typically a wait, so get there early. This weekend, we went around 9:30 and were sat right away, which we were a little surprised by, but there was a wait when we left. Service is quick, and the restaurant is clean.  Their potatoes are amazing. The potatoes and onions are soft but have enough crispy bits that the texture is really good. I definitely recommend those, and you can get them with lunch too. I usually order one of their specialty hotcakes, frequently the blueberry ones. Thin crepe-like pancakes with buttery crispy edges rolled up around fruit. Mmmm...I want to go back just thinking of them. I've also gotten the chorizo hash, which is really good, and definitely too much food, but that's what I expect from a diner.  This most recent time I went, I got Gail's Favorite eggs. It's scrambled eggs with cream cheese and green onions, served with the lyonnaise potatoes and toast. I thought the eggs were good, but was a little surprised that the cream cheese was just two little balls on top. I expected it to be little pieces mixed in with the eggs. While I enjoyed it, I might stick with other dishes in the future. It's been a while since I got those awesome hotcakes so already wanting to go back to get those again.",

    "text": "O.M.G. I currently live in Cleveland and I have my favorite breakfast/brunch go to place here (called Coventry Inn). But after going to Pamela's, now I'm depressed that Cleveland doesn't have a brunch place as good as Pamela's! I am craving this spot!  Pamela's is your usual diner spot... place looks a bit homey, a bit dirty, and a bit...local. But that's when you know it's good right? It's got some real homemade cooking into it. If you don't want to listen to my suggestions on what to order, just (i beg you) make sure you order the CORN BEEF HASH. Here's my reviews below now:  Corn Beef Hash (5+): I don't know what they add in there, but that sh*t is delicious and addictive. I took one bite, and it was like my palette was ready for 5 more bowls of it. The corned beef in the hash is so good. They season the corned beef so well that it gives the whole dish this heavenly taste.  Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes (5): I think Pamela's called crepes hotcakes. This was just chocolate chip banana crepes. So naturally, it was delicious. The hotcakes was made really well, a bit crispy on the ends. and the melting chocolate with banana was just yummmmmmy.  Go to Pittsburgh, and you better stop at Pamela's. There might be a wait, but trust me, it's worth it. And it's cheap!",

I had the corned beef hash, and it was actually pretty good, but far to greasy, and it didn't need to be.

They should pull back on the seasoning especially since corned beef is salty already.",

I'd heard bad things from a coworker years back, and it just put me off from ever going until this weekend.   We waited a half hour for a party of six. They don't have a kids menu, so my daughter and I split a breakfast. They brought extra plates with no issue, service was fast and friendly, the decor is nice and the whole place has this laid back, comfort feel. The staff was all so nice it almost killed my appetite... But then those pancakes came.   Don't get me wrong. The eggs were good. The sausage was good. The coffee, the potatoes, the bacon, it was all good, but these pancakes... It was a spiritual experience. Most of the time my pancakes are something that get nibbled on but they are so thick at other places you can never finish them. Pamela's pancakes have an amazing texture to them, they're thinner than normal pancakes but crisp on the edges, I mean damn. I only regret not ordering more pancakes. Or all of the pancakes.   And considering they aren't really outside of the eat n Park /Dennys price range, I mean why do people even go there when Pamela's exists. No comparison. Just go to Pamela's already.",

    "text": "We've all had a bad dining experience at one point or another.  Maybe it was the bad food or the inattentive server or the annoying atmosphere...or the lethal combination of all three.  There is a point in any restaurant adventure when you settle in. \"Oh, man, this place is great,\" you might say.  Unfortunately, sometimes that's not the case and you're left with \"Uhh...seriously?\"  It's disappointing because yes, it's a waste of time and money.  But it's also a waste of ENTHUSIASM.  I don't know about you guys, but I really look forward to going out to eat (hence this blog).  Anyone who has ever seen me with a box of DiCarlo's pizza knows I can get pretty excited about food.  So what happens when all of your resources and expectations finally come together for a nice meal and it just doesn't work out?   Pamela's Diner is one of the most famous restaurants in Pittsburgh.  There are six locations, and last weekend I finally made it to the one on Walnut Street.  I've heard so much praise for this neighborhood breakfast nook  since I've lived here.  Take a drive down Forbes or Walnut on a Sunday morning and you will see people literally lined up down the street, even in January.  Pam's is so famous, in fact, that President Obama visited the diner & then requested Pamela's pancakes at a White House function this past May; those are some famous flapjacks.    I was ready for a mind-blowingly awesome, turning-point-in-my-life kind of breakfast.    What I got was decidedly less than mind-blowing, without even a whisper of awesome.    Ryan and I arrived early to beat the rush.  (Sidenote:  Pamela's is CASH ONLY.  Thankfully I saw the sign when I walked in, so I had to run back down the street to a nearby ATM, that could have cost us a table.)  Anyway, there were a few tables open at that point, so the hostess told us to take a seat wherever we'd like.  There was a table for two by the front door (nah...too cold) and a couple of open tables inside the restaurant.  We chose a table happily, and we didn't have to wait in line!  Let's do this!  We ordered a couple of coffees and scanned the menu.  I guess this is where I should mention that there were two hostesses working the door at Pamela's that day, and both of them were wearing headsets.  Presumably the headsets would make it easier to direct patrons to available tables, you know, rather than running back and forth all morning.  Anyway, so when one of the headset ladies came over and asked us \"...that's where you're sitting?\",  I guessed that the other headset lady hadn't filled her in on the whole \"sit wherever you want\" thing.  \"But it's a four-seater.\"  Ugh.  Seriously?  Are they really going to move us after we've been here for ten minutes? (They didn't.)  That was when I realized that Pamela's operates on a very \"head 'em up, move 'em out\" mentality. Herd the cattle in, feed them, and send them back out to pasture. I understand that is how restaurants work, I just don't like it when it is so obvious-it was very uncomfortable.   I ordered the vegetarian omelette and some wheat toast. As we were waiting for our breakfast, the dining room filled up. All of a sudden, Pamela's was crazy-busy...at least 30 people were waiting for tables to open up; 30 cold, hungry people. I think I made eye contact with an Indian man waiting in the doorway as the server was dropping off our food. Awwkkwwarrd.  I was surprised to find a side of home fries next to my omelette. (Don't you usually get a choice? Hash browns? Fruit cup?) Thank goodness I'm a fan of onions because those 'taters were covered in them. What if I hated onions? Anyway, I dug in to the omelette. Green peppers, mushrooms, tomatos, and cheddar cheese...how could I go wrong? Texture, that's how. The veggies were undercooked, hard and flavorless. Cold veggies nestled is a rubbery mattress of egg & cheese. I ended up using ketchup & Red Hot to spice my breakfast up, but I still couldn't finish it. It wasn't very good.  The whole meal only took about 30 minutes, but apparently that wasn't fast enough. The waitress dropped the check off at our table and by the time we walked the six feet across the room to the cash register to pay, the head-set ladies already had our table cleared and a party (of four) seated at our table. We had to track the waitress down to give the tip to her personally. I didn't mind that so much, though, because she was a fantastic server. (Thank you!)  I think I would have been more inclined to forgive the hostesses for being so impatient, if only the food had lived up to the hype. After this particular breakfast, I walked away thinking that maybe I shouldn't test Pittsburgh's mythology. If people want to think that they've got something special in Pamela's (or Primanti's or LeMont), maybe it's better to let that be. What do you think? Pamela's in Shadyside 5527 Walnut Street Pittsburgh, PA 15232-2350 (412) 683-4066",

The 5 other places are incredibly popular..Witness most of these current reviews.  The lines to get in are intimidating.  One would think if you waited until 11:00 AM,  it would be better...Nope.  The only pancakes I've ever had like Pamela's can be found at the excellent Original Pancake House chain..Their 49'er pancakes are the equal of Pamela's.    Pamela's is unique.  Their hash browns are very different as well.  Almost creamy in texture.  The two women who started this chain came up with these two recipes and it formed the basis of one of Pittsburgh's most successful restaurants.  Hopefully one day, a former cook will give us their recipes.",

After waiting for an hour to get seated, we were expecting good food, and in reality, everything was drenched in butter. Everything was super greasy, buttery. Even their hotcakes (which are like crepes - love crepes) they look great, but once you taste them, it's all butter. Our party also tried the French toast and hash browns and those were super greasy too and didn't taste good at all. The reason it's so busy is because it's the only show in town. There are a few of them and there's really nowhere else to go. It's sad. Being from NJ and having many diners that compete with each other, there are some good tasting Diners making good French toast, crepes and hash browns. This was just a joke and DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE WAIT. The service on the other hand, was very good and workers were very nice and helpful.",

This day, it wasn't busy, and the speed of service was good. The French toast was an abomination. The toast had about a quarter inch of egg white formed around the edges, from poorly mixed batter. Plus the bread was poor quality. The bacon...crunchy fleks of the thinnest, most meager bacon these eyes have seen. The crepe pancakes were ok, but nothing to write home about. Years ago I worked for a grumpy penny pincher who had been swindled into buying a 3 year supply of prepackaged coffee, which just sat in our storeroom for years until we brewed it, and cursed it. Van roots, it was. Pamela's, in all the years I Have visited, has consistently challenged van rooy for the worst coffee crown. On top of all the bad food, last week Pamela's earned that crown. We'll be enjoying breakfast elsewhere in the future.",

It seems like no matter how early I show up, it's impossible to get seated in under 30 minutes on a weekend.  Do I feel like it's worth the wait? Yes, but I try to make it count. I usually order Gail's favorite eggs AND some hotcakes and eat half there, with half to take home.  I have had omelettes here before, but they are very standard diner omelettes: brown/slightly overcooked. I prefer Gail's eggs because they come perfectly cooked, not overdone.  Honestly though, I feel like the Lyonnaise potatoes are my absolute favorite thing. I am craving them right now.",

After traveling around a bit and living in NYC, I admit I have been spoiled. In college, Pamela's was the best brunch thing to me, but now I've gotten pickier.   The hot cakes are great as everyone had mentioned. It's a cross between a pancake and a crepe, but leans more towards the latter. I got the Banana Walnut Hotcake, and it definitely hit the spot. I also tried the Tex Mex Omelette, which was tasty as well. It had a little bit of heat, and the side potatoes were good too.  Overall, a solid, safe bet for brunch. Be sure to get there early, as the dining room fills up quickly. Cash only (PNC ATM is across the street). They also grossly underestimate the wait times when I went on busy Sunday mornings.",

    "text": "I am so bummed and disappointed that my Pamela's experience was less than stellar.  I haven't been here in maybe 10 years and it is not at all as I had remembered.  We went on a Sunday and I expected a wait, which was fine.  We were seated within 45 minutes - which again, is standard.  It's almost communal seating with how close the tables are.  They cram about 60 people in a space that was intended for 30, so be prepared to bump elbows with your neighbor.  However, I tried to not let this bother me, because I was expecting a phenomenal meal.  I will touch on the service. They were busy, but our waitress was slightly cold and barely around. Again, I was willing to brush this off for the delicious food I anticipated.  This was one of the most disappointing food experiences I've had in Pittsburgh. My boyfriend ordered the Tex Mex omelette.  It was average, but not restaurant quality.  The only thing that made it somewhat decent was sour cream and guacamole.  This average omelette was still FAR better than what I had.  His omelette is the only reason I'm giving them two stars.  I wanted to keep it simple so I ordered the French Toast.  It had absolutely zero flavor.  I'm not sure how bread with sugar, butter and syrup can have zero taste.  To combat its lack of flavor, I doused those puppies in maple syrup.  After about a 75 second pour, I figured that could suffice and give this meal the kick it needed.  Somehow, this French Toast became a vortex and sucked up all the maple syrup, making it more sugary and less flavorful all at once. I ate about 2 bites and left the rest. It wasn't worth even trying to eat for absolutely zero taste.  I also had a side of Oscar Mayer microwave bacon for $3.  Needless to say, we won't be going back for quite some time!",

    "text": "My friend suggested going to Pamela's for brunch when I was visiting by saying \"Obama comes here when he's in town\", so I was obviously game since hey, if it's good enough for the President... There was a bit of a wait when we arrived at 10:30, which is to be expected on the weekends. When we were finally seated in about half an hour, we decided to share the chocolate chip banana hotcakes, Gail's Famous Eggs, and a side of bacon. I also ordered a small orange juice, which I would recommend steering clear from. A small cup is big enough for a 3 year old and the orange juice tasted like 80% tap water, 20% orange juice concentrate.   The food came out really fast, which was great since we were starving after waiting for a bit to be seated. I thought both plates were really delicious! The hot cakes were definitely a mix of a crepe and a pancake since the edges are thin and crispy and the middle was thicker and softer. Loved the bananas, chocolate chips, and whipped cream filling and really appreciated that they split the dish onto 2 plates for us. The eggs were also really good, but I wish the cream cheese was softer since it was difficult to spread on the eggs. We requested extra crispy Lyonnaise potatoes, which I would highly recommend since I prefer crispy potatoes to mushy ones. I would not recommend ordering the bacon unless you just want a bacon taste in your mouth since the bacon is paper thin, greasy, and not very satisfying.  Overall, I thought everything was really tasty and a great spot for breakfast/brunch, especially if you have any visiting friends or family!",

It's tiny, cheek-by-jowl and often a long line on the weekends, but worth the wait and the cash-only inconvenience.  I can't speak to anything but the breakfast food since I've never been able to get past it!  My husband and I who lived within walking distance (or waddling distance, when leaving to go home) would normally split a hotcake special with the ham and cheese omelet.  That way we each could get eggs, meat, pancake, and potato cravings fulfilled.  When I went without him, I would either get the breakfast special or the corned beef hash with a side of the hotcake, regular.  My favorite hotcake flavor was the banana and chocolate chip, but occasionally we would get the strawberry or blueberry - don't be afraid by the sour cream ingredient.  It tastes AMAZING, and not too rich. (any richer, with the buttery hotcakes it would be over the top and make it more like dessert than breakfast).  Their hot cocoa is probably from the package, but made decadent by the generous dollop of whipped cream that floats majestically on top.  I once sat next to Franco Harris at the next table.  If he and Obama eat their hearts out here, you'll do fine.  Come try it already!",

I'm not sure if the reason was because I went to a different location but I'm definitely a fan. My breakfast of choice was the strawberry hotcakes and I hit the jackpot. My love for strawberries coupled with slightly sweetened hotcakes hit the spot on the rigidly cold day I went. My friends ordered the chorizo breakfast special and also loved it! If you have a hankering for awesome breakfast food, Pamela's on Walnut is definitely the place to go!",

Usually stuffed with fruit and whipped cream and fried in butter.  Extremely sweet and rich and the best ever cure for a college hangover.  Prices are cheap and the place is cash only.

I got Gail's favorite eggs (scrambled eggs with cream cheese and scallions) and they were pretty good. I was hoping the cream cheese and scallions would be blended in, alas, they were just on top. Still a good combo, though. Their famous potatoes really are amazing, definitely the highlight of the meal!   My friend got the corned beef hash and it was UBER SALTY. Like, super ridiculously salty. I know hash usually tends to have a lot of salt but this was outta control.   I like that they have rye toast. I don't like that they have Pepsi products and super rude employees.

When I moved back to my hometown Chicago after my 2 year life in Pittsburgh, we tried finding a breakfast place just as good in Chicago. Never happened. It is now 10 years later, nothing better than Pamela's from pittsburgh  I missed Pamela's so much (and pittsburgh in general, sure), that last summer in 2013 my friends and I drove the 8 hours from Chicago to Pittsburgh just so I can experience Pamela's again.  It was just as good as it was 10 years ago - and I told the waitress that myself.   We will be making another 1-night trip again this summer. They are hooked.  Nothing like Pamelas. Nothing. Oh the memories...",

It's quite possibly the best tasting pancake I've had.  The edges get crispy and the middle stays soft.    Atmosphere is what you would likely expect from a dinner: busy, loud, fun.  Don't be intimidated to ask questions or things that you might need. The staff is super nice.  They're just busy trying to keep the place chugging along.    BRING CASH if you intend to eat at Pamela's.  They are cash only.    Plan to spend around $10-12 per person.  You'll leave feeling full and super happy.",

Definitely my go-to for weekend brunch or hangover recovery in Pittsburgh. The Oakland location you'll find is often full of Pitt or Carnegie Mellon students, whereas the Squirrel Hill and Shadyside locations usually have a more yuppie-type clientele.  Pamela's hotcakes are a masterpiece. Never mind that they use pounds and pounds of butter for these hotcakes, you'll be hard-pressed to find pancakes/crepes as delicious as these. What's great is that they can be eaten alone in a savory manner, or piled with fruit and whipped cream and more butter for a sweeter breakfast experience. The lyonnaise potatoes are also something to marvel at. You can ask them to griddle the potatoes a little longer for a crispier taste, which I definitely recommend.   The omelets are all pretty standard fare here, but they do them consistently well every time I've been. Best thing is that most combinations or menu items will only run you at about $8-10, with tip and tax about $13. Pretty awesome. Only downside is that it's cash only, but since there are a couple ATM's and a PNC nearby, it can be overlooked.   Overall, come here for some of the best breakfast comfort food that Pittsburgh has to offer.",

One of the first things you will notice is that there is a photo of Obama at the cash register right out front.    Some things to point out before I get to the food is that the washrooms are upstairs through the South American restaurant that shares the same building.  Another thing is that the tables do not move so there is no re-arranging for larger parties.  This place only accepts cash unless they've changed that from the last time I was there it's always been like this at least for this location.  The tables are small considering the amount of plates you will get when you order breakfast.  Really with the coffee and side plates of toast, hash, etc it will be a balancing act to get everything on one plate maybe...  So if you ordered side of sausage or whatever, if you can throw it on your main plate and stack all the side plates if possible.  Now to the food.  It's damn good period.  I mean breakfast is tough because you can really only twist it so many ways so what makes Pam's special?  The crepes and pancakes is what is unique if I had to pick something.  The crepes you can get will walnut and creme and whatever but they ultimately become humongous and if you had something else like bacon and eggs then you will have no room on your table and in your stomach (maybe) because the portions can be big.  I prefer plain pan cakes with butter and syrup and nothing else added myself... their pancakes... the edges are crispy and light but not too fluffy.    We usually get a side of corned beef hash which is just awesome but wow I try not to think about how much sodium is in it especially since I always get bacon too.  The place has packed for a reason and they're not all tourists because Shadyside is a nice cozy neighborhood.  When locals pack a place consistently the reason is simple... the place is +++",

Pamela's is the perfect breakfast/brunch spot for anyone with a sweet tooth.   I ordered their Strawberry pancakes and it was an explosion of sugary goodness in my mouth. Each order comes with 2 thin hotcakes rolled up in cylindrical fashion, filled with fresh strawberries, brown sugar, syrup and topped with whipped cream. If I didn't have diabetes before, I just may have it now. The hotcakes were melt-in-your-mouth soft while retaining some crispiness and char along the edges.   I also ordered scrambled eggs and ham which were both pretty average. My buddy ordered the Tex-Mex omelet and was less than impressed. Sure, the food might be a little greasy and/or buttery but I did not go to Pamela's expecting to eat granola and bananas. Overall, the food, service and ambiance were all pretty average. The Strawberry pancakes was the only exceptional dish that raised my overall rating of Pamela's to a 4.",

    "text": "The long waiting line here seems to be a usual occurrence here at Pamela's diner, but the wait itself isn't too long either as the line does move reasonably fast.  I was glad to have tried their blueberry hot cakes after seeing and reading how hot cakes are signature dishes of this place. I usually don't like having sweet breakfast dish like pancakes or waffles as main breakfast dishes but was glad I decided to try the hot cakes here. To my surprise, the hot cakes were not as doughy or too sweet at all. The corner of the cake was even crispy that it makes the cake not too filling. If I had to choose another filling for the cakes, however, I'd pick strawberry fillings instead of blueberry because with strawberries I think you get fresh ones instead of blueberries like what I had this time which seemed a bit processed.  My SO also ordered some breakfast egg dish with corned beef hash and a side of lyonnaise potatoes. I didn't try his breakfast dish but tried the side potatoes that we ordered...and they definitely were yummy! I couldn't pin point how they got their lyonnaise potatoes so tasty..but maybe with a bit of cream?, onions and some butter? ...I honestly have no idea...I took a bite of the lyonnaise potatoes...and ended up finishing the whole side dish :x..oops..it was that good :)  If you are looking for a good breakfast place in Pittsburgh, check Pamela's diner out. They have 4-5 locations within Pittsburgh. also, make sure you bring cash, as they don't take credit cards! Happy brunching here! :)",

Large group waiting meant this was good to go! Staff was very friendly and fast.  We ordered and the food was there within 10 min.  Very impressed.  I ordered a stuffed hot cake with blueberries and it came out looking like a crepe which I loved.  The resin was that the hot cakes were stuffed with blueberries.  Definitely got your money's worth here.  Portions were not to bad or I learned my lesson from the day before.  Price was also very good too! They also have a location in the Strip District.  I recommend!",

The hubby and I headed down to Shadyside and got on the waiting list after 10:30. It took less than a half hour to get our table in the crowded and (very) noisy diner.   Service was prompt, and we ordered enough food for four people! I really enjoyed my Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes. The light and crispy hotcakes were wrapped around little chocolate chips, banana slices, and whipped cream. So tasty! My side of turkey sausage and scrambled eggs were descent diner fare but nothing above average.  Overall, I had a nice experience at Pamela's and would rate the food/establishment 3 1/2 stars. However, there are other breakfast/brunch competition in Pittsburgh that will continue to get my business over Pamela's.",

It's definitely got a diner feel and they turn tables over quickly, which is good because there is ALWAYS a line. There's really not a lot of room to wait, but people wait.   It's sort of a madhouse, especially if the weather is bad and people don't want to wait outside.   I'm more of a reservation girl and don't have a lot of patience for lines, but this is a place I'll wait for.    Prices are a it higher than diner prices, but not unreasonable.   Payment is CASH ONLY and I'd be sort of surprised to hear that they don't have a lot of people walking out without paying.

On the savory side, Pamela's makes very competent omelets and gives plenty of options on egg whites only/eggbeaters.  The most famous aspect of their savory foods is the \"hash browns\" which have some spices/herbs that almost taste like  a super mild and buttery Indian Masala.  They are really really great--ask for them to make them extra crispy.  On the sweet side, their crepe-esque pancakes are delicious.  As mentioned, I am not much of a sweets guy, but after my omelet, I do enjoy sneaking a bite or two off of the edge of my wife or child's buttery, mapley pancakes.    In Shadyside, don't be surprised to see Lynn Swann, and expect to wait for a table on a Saturday or Sunday.",

Potatoes) are outstanding, and are the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  I would also strongly recommend their corned beef hash!  As other reviews has commented, be sure to bring cash, as it is cash only.  Also, if you plan to go, you may have to wait in line, as Pamela's in the Strip is typically pretty crowded, especially on weekends.  That said, this restaurant is totally worth the wait.

However, to make up for the food being awful, you will have to wait on line for 20 minutes and then dine in cramped and uncomfortable seating.  It is, for some reason, unfathomably popular.  The best thing on the menu is their crepe-like pancakes, which are nicely crisped on the edges.  They are nicely crisped on the edges because they are cooked in a disgusting margarine-like substance that always leaves me, personally, feeling a bit ill.  The coffee is forgettable, the eggs are passable, the bacon is inevitably chewy -- which right there should cause someone to be marched out to the firing squad -- and their lyonnaise potatoes are insultingly limp (and, like the pancakes, soaked in margarine).  If you are dragged here by your friends, find new friends.  If you can't do that, then try to get one of the pancakes that come with some sort of whipped or sour cream.  Not because they're better, mind you, but because at least the cream will help balance the fat that comes from a machine with fat that, at some point in its history, came from a cow.  Better alternatives to Pamela's in Pittsburgh:  on the 'nice' end, Coca Cafe or even Square Cafe, on the 'greasy spoon' end either DeLuca's or JoJo's.  Frankly, I think I'd rather eat the completely boring and institutional breakfasts at Eat and Park than go to Pamela's again.  At least they have heard of this thing called \"butter.\"",

The crepes are the same as their pancakes, which are light, lacy and crisp around the edges. Perfection by themselves....they come with several fillings and toppings but I decided to go with my wait person's recommendation. The strawberries were sliced paper thin, fresh, not at all syrupy, and there were two, huge, filled crepes on my plate-enough for two people. I asked for the sour cream on the side, and there was a dollop of freshly whipped cream (not instant, I know these things) in the middle of both crepes. Dusted over the top was a thin coat of granulated sugar (it may have been turbinado) and just a hint of course sea salt. The texture and taste was amazing! The menu was interesting with omelets, egg dishes, french toast, and the usual breakfast fare. All that I saw going by looked good, but my recommendation would be, if you go only once, skip all that and go right for a pancake/crepe creation. You will NOT be disappointed. Also, the order came out 1 minute after the wait person brought my coffee; like magic. This place is a jewel in the middle of Walnut Street!",

Not only was everything in a pool of grease, but it seemed to be margarine...not even real butter. I will never eat here again. I am gagging even thinking about this meal let aloe eating it again.",

    "text": "The past weekend, I was visiting my bff's in Pittsburgh.  We decided to do Sunday brunch, and I asked bff 1 where she wanted to go - she said she'd heard Pamela's in Shadyside was amazing, and had been dying to go there.  BFF 2 said she had heard all about it and she too had been dying to go, and so it was decided.    with hype like that, i was hoping it would live up to expectations.  when we arrived, we put our names on the list and waited for about 10-15 minutes.  Pamela's is pretty small, there are maybe 20 tables - some for only 2, some for 4-tops, but the turn over time seems pretty fast.  we settled in and looked over the menu.  the prices are pretty amazing - you can easily do brunch here for under $10/person.  i ordered the strawberry \"hotcakes\" which are not actually crepes, despite what reviews here say... but they are a bit thinner than regular pancakes (crepes would be much thinner than this) and rolled up like crepes.  mine were stuffed with sliced strawberry, brown sugar, and usually sour cream (i asked for mine w/o the sour cream - this place is enough of a greasy spoon).  others at the table had the strawberry and blueberry hotcakes.  we also ordered the hash browns for the table to share.    the hotcakes are most certainly fried - the edges are greasy and crisp.  delicious to eat!  i think i may have made a mistake ordering no sour cream, b/c the hotcake stuffed with strawberries and dry piles of brown sugar was at times too sweet for me.  next time, i'd ask for very light sour cream or possibly no sour cream and no brown sugar.  the hash browns were amazingly delicious, so buttery and melt in your mouth good.  these were gobbled up by the 3 of us!  the hotcakes were large, and too much for me to finish!    service was ok - pamela's is a pretty simple place in that aspect, you see your server when you order and to drop off the check.  aside from that, they stand back and let you marvel at the good food.  i would definitely return to pamela's on my next trip to the 'burgh.",

It wasn't busy and we got a table right away. Someone got water for the table and then 15 minutes go by and nothing. I had to go the counter to let them know we had been waiting and no one has come to take our order. The lady a spoke with a lot of attitude. She placed our orders and initially, we were fine with just waters and then one of the girls ordered a coffee. The waiter brought over the coffee and someone else decided they wanted coffee as well. Instead of just getting another cup, she said in a very passive aggressive tone \"Is there ANYTHING else that I can get ANYONE at this table?\". We said no at the point. In hindsight, I should've asked for the manager. I saw that our order was done shortly. There server pretended to be busy with other things and let our food sit for at least 5 minutes. She had another server bring over the plates and left mine to sit under the lamp for an additional 5 minutes. I ordered the greek wrap with fries. They gave me the scraps from the bag and my food wasn't even warm by the time I got it. Very disappointed with the service. Hopefully this was a one time thing",

I've stood in line at Pamela's, I've turned in my name with my \"party\" and gone off to fetch coffee a few doors down to pretend for awhile that I wasn't starving, yet the past few times I had the pleasure of sitting down (\"Please seat yourself\"--that is what the sign read) immediately.  What a luxury!  Of course, the most recent of these times  (four of them, not that I counted--on two different trips: May, 2008, and July, 2008) occurred between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m. on weekdays.  Okay: two more things.  1) Pamela's cash register displays a sign: Cash Only...so don't try to give 'em a check, debit or credit card.

    "text": "On my trip to Pittsburgh we decided to stop by here for a Sunday brunch after hearing it was one of the best breakfast places in the city.    It was very crowded and they pack you in like a high school cafeteria.  It is a no frills atmosphere with the menu waiting on the table.  It was packed with hung over college kids when we were there around 12:30 pm on a Sunday. They have a good variety of breakfast foods to choose from including hotcakes, french toast, omelettes, etc.  They also had the classic breakfast sides of bacon, sausage and home fries.  I chose the strawberry hotcakes.  This was a couple of crepe like pancakes with strawberries and sour cream stuffed between and some whipped cream on top.  The hotcakes were excellent.  They were soft in the middle, but kind of crispy around the edges.  Just like I want them.  Also, the strawberries inside were very good.  They were sweet and juicy.  This was the best part of the meal.  Now for the not so good.  The home fries were mushy all around and there might have been some type of cheese sauce on them.  There was something creamy mixed with them that I was not sure about.  I like my home fries to be crispy on the outside.  These were just mush.  Finally the bacon was bush league.  If you are going to market yourself as a breakfast spot you cannot serve rinky dink bacon like this.  It was a disgrace.  You need to have big meaty, crispy flavorful bacon.  This bacon was thinner than a piece of paper.  It was just not what you should have if you are specializing in breakfast.  If I wouldn't have enjoyed the hotcakes so much, I would have rated this place a 2.  Go for the hotcakes, but order the sausage over then bacon and skip the home fries.",

This place will be on the rotation for me when I am in the strip district. Yeah the foods greasy and stuff, but what's the point in living if you can't feel alive?

    "text": "Patrons from all over Pittsburgh come to enjoy Pamela's thin and delicious pancakes, huge servings of home fries and three egg omelets - and they should.  The first of the Pamela's family, this Shadyside staple has been around long before owners Gail Klingensmith and Pamela Cohen decided to branch out across Pittsburgh.  Since 1980, Pamela's has been voted \"Best Breakfast\" by Pittsburgh's City Paper survey.  Not to mention the diner's modest flare received the White House's \"Presidential approval.\"    In the fall, while President Obama was on the campaign trail, he ate breakfast at Pamela's.  He loved the crepe-style pancakes so much, he asked Klingensmith and Cohen to prepare a Memorial Day breakfast at the White House for him and dozens of American troops!  Now, that's a good pancake!  I've sampled just about everything on the breakfast menu and, after eight years of patronage, my favorite is still the strawberry hotcakes.  These thinly poured crepes are laid flat, then rolled around a delicious combination of strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream, topped off with a nice dab of whipped cream to truly send your sugar levels through the roof.  They're simple, delicious and just enough not to feel \"stuffed.\"  The egg and omelet plates come with home fries (chunky sliced potatoes with what appears to be approximately 1/4 small white onion and a 1/2 lb of butter per serving) and your choice of toast.   The spinach and feta omelet with rye is a decent combination.  But as a warning, these plates are not for the weak.    For smaller appetites, they do offer fresh fruit bowls, egg white plates and a variety of a la carte items.    The space is typical of older Walnut Street buildings with typical diner flare - simple painted brick with tables bolted to the walls.  On weekends, the room get's pretty cramped.  (A note to parents with small children: if you have large strollers, it may be a good idea to either leave them in the car or ensure they pack neatly in the corner.)  If you get there around 11:00 a.m. the wait can run you about 30 minutes or more, and there's literally one small bench to sit at while inside.  Weekday crowds are much lighter.    Parking can be found on the street, or in the metered parking lot located behind the building.  There's no need to feed street meters on Sundays.    All in all, this diner is a classic.  It's managed to outlive a lot of other local businesses while the larger corporate chains have moved on the street.  Perhaps it's the presidential influence, perhaps because it's \"cash only,\" but I think it's because the food is good, down-home cooking.",

I had their Blueberry pancakes as part of my breakfast combo. My friends had the strawberry pancakes and the french toast with walnuts. All three dishes were delicious (my mouth is watering just thinking about that meal).   The pancakes are sort of in between flapjacks and crepes, and the blueberries (fresh ones) were folded into the pancake with sour cream  and brown sugar (which complimented the blueberries beautifully).  The rest of my breakfast was tasty too, but nothing to write home about, especially compared to the pancakes.   They get very crowded and they will not seat you until your entire party is ready to be seated. Also, they do not accept credit cards (CASH ONLY).",

We headed to Pamela's as soon as I saw the reviews.   There were about 15 people hovering outside so went in to put our name down. Here's my only complaint. We waited patiently in the line while people paid to put our names down, but then about 6 people just cut in front of the line, which was a bit rude.   The seating is tight, but the atmosphere diner-esque. Upon the walls are some differing varieties of art (some for sale, no less).   The menu, while not particularly health-conscious, was heavy on eggs and pancakes. We went with the specialty pancakes, banana-walnut and choc. chip.  Both were delicious. I really wanted to and tried to finish mine, but I just couldn't man up.   The other complaint, which is of no-fault of the restaurant, was the mother of teenage boys next to use who repeatedly started screaming at them and causing quite the scene. Despite the deliciousness of the food, things got tense for a while.   I think the next time I have a serious pankcake-hankering, I'll find myself wishing Boston had a Pamela's.",

Even when Obama visited the 'Burgh last year he stopped in. By the cashier, there's a picture of him flashing a giant smile, flanked by whom I'm assuming are the owners. (He went to the one on the Strip -- I asked.)  This particular location is in the Walnut Street shopping district, and it's not terribly large. It's not as funky as the Oakland area Pamela's, but the food is just as good. Upstairs is an unrelated Peruvian shop/cafe, which doesn't seem to serve food on Sundays.  At about 11:30 AM Sunday morning, on Valentine's Day no less, the wait here was only half an hour. Not bad! The crowd seemed to have doubled by the time my party and I left. Originally we had wanted to go to the Oakland one but it was a total mob scene and tried this location instead.  The Food:  Fattening, delicious, huge and cheap: every diner should aspire to this! They don't serve lunch specials on Sundays, which is fine because all we wanted were the hotcakes! We all got breakfast specials ($6.75 for 2 eggs any style, 2 hotcakes and ham or sausage or bacon) and were allowed to substitute home fries or toast for the meat options. For $2 extra you could substitute a specialty hotcake.   HUGE HUGE HUGE PORTIONS. Two separate gigantic dinner plates were needed for 1) eggs and home fries and 2) hotcakes which took up the entire plate. I made the mistake of spreading butter on top of my regular hotcakes, which I didn't realize were already approximately 50% butter in the first place. They're thinner and crispier than your average pancake and a little too salty but still good. The speciality hotcakes are more crepe-like in that they're stuffed with the filling of your choice and whipped cream and then rolled up. Whoa.  Coffee's kind of weak. The servers are the sweetest people you'll ever meet. Cash only.",

The veggies are always crunchy so I taste more of a raw onion than I do my omelet. The food comes out fast which is great until I tasted the food. I checked it out three or four times  to see if it might be different but the omelets were the same. Raw and crunchy. overall  nice atmosphere, nice service, but the food is blah",

I've lived here for years and been a few times but I'm usually pretty resistant when someone suggests Pamela's because I don't feel like waiting in a huge crowd for breakfast food that is good, but not justified by the wait.   I have changed my tune...mostly. Two family members in town for a total of four of us around noon on Saturday of Thanksgiving weekend. The wait was about 25 minutes but not much of a problem with all the shopping nearby. I would say the wait they quoted us was pretty much spot on.   The chorizo hash is the selection here for sure. My sister and I shared an order of that and an order of the plain pancakes. Just the right amount of savory, spicy and salty and definitely way more than enough food for us to share.   One thing I don't really like is their eggs.....way to buttery tasting. Even without finishing the eggs there was plenty to eat and the taste of the eggs is more a matter of personal preference.   Cash only...but they make that really clear from the minute you walk in so no one should be caught unprepared.",

If you are reading this, now you know. Take cash! If you don't read this and just show up, any number of signs will tell you cash only. Go get cash!  Now that that is out of the way, I can't think of anything not to like about this place. I love the crepe style hotcakes especially the Chocolate Chip Banana Hotcakes with Whipped Cream. And it is real whipped cream. They have a crispy layer and so much flavor. And they are big! An order of eggs any style, sausage and Lyonnaise Potatoes tops the order off. Those potatoes are phenomenal! Add a little hot sauce and you have a real winner.  If you find yourself here you absolutely must try the hotcakes if nothing else. The other items are a small step above most diners but you come for the hotcakes.  It's a busy place and the staff is rushing around like crazy to get everyone taken care of so they really didn't have time to be rude or ignore you. They were attentive, helpful with questions and fast. Let's put it this way, after a 30 minute wait we were seated, ate and paid (with cash) in under another 30 minutes.   One thing I did find a little strange is that the restrooms are upstairs.  But you get to walk through a pretty cool foreign gift shop to get to them so all is good. Sorry, I can't remember the ethnicity of the gift shop but I spent a little time looking around and found it fascinating.  Check it out!",

I usually feel satisfied and happy after eating here, while the other location usually leaves me feeling pretty bloated.   Today I got brunch with a few friends and we ordered the strawberry crepes, chocolate chip banana crepes, lyonnaise potatoes, and Tex-mex omelette. The omelette was absolutely amazing!! I love potatoes too so I would highly suggest that dish. The crepes are a bit too egg-y for me, but they are also a staple dish to order here.  Overall, Pamela's isn't somewhere I'd usually lean towards going to and there are many brunch spots in the area that I prefer, but..... It is definitely a must-visit stop in the city and never a disappointment!",

We met a dear friend on Saturday midday for brunch/lunch, and I ask myself, why did I wait so long to go back, after a multitude of trips back to the \"Burgh\" throughout the years?   I had an omelet -- cooked to perfection. I am a picky omelet eater. My eggs have to be cooked just so . . . and so they were! Truly a rarity. The accompanying potatoes were heavenly. My husband loved his corned beef and hash with eggs and potatoes. The short stack of pancakes that our friend ordered was huge . . . and after one bite, I was in Seventh Heaven. Oh, how I wish I could make pancakes just like that! The thin pancakes, almost crepe-like, with their crispy outer edges are divine.   This location begs for an aesthetic makeover . . . looks like the same furniture as 25 years ago, but what it lacks there, it makes up for in the yummy food. Service was quick but unremarkable.   Next time we're back in town, we'll definitely stop by for breakfast -- early so we don't have to wait!",

It gets packed every weekend with students, parents, and locals alike. don't be afraid to put your name in and wait the little bit to get an amazing breakfast. the interior is pretty festive with old school board games all over the walls and ceiling. Has some of the standards of breakfast such as pancakes (hotcakes), eggs, omelets, etc  but also has their spin on it.   this is a cash only restaurant so make sure that you have plenty of cash in order to pay for this meal. I really liked the western style omelet that i got which had chorizo sausage in it. so good",

    "text": "We loved this place so much we went twice in the span of 2 days. We would've gone again if it weren't cash only. Anyway the hot cakes are incredible first day I got the banana and chocolate chip hot cakes and these are cooked so perfectly with nice crispy edges on the crepe-like hot cakes. You cannot miss the homefries/famous lyonnaise potatoes these potatoes are to die for, some of the best home fries I've ever had. The first day we came it was about lunch time so my eating partners both ordered the diner burger and they absolutely loved it. Today they both had the chorizo hash special which was also amazing. Needless to say anything you get is going to be great. The staff is nice and you can get in and out really quick if you need to. There were no waits either of the times we came through. If you're in Pittsburgh this place is not to miss!!",

The wait & service:  Pretty decent considering the overwhelming flow of people in and out of this fine establishment. The evil part is that they make you wait outside while you stare at the unlucky window-seaters chomp away at their food. Service was a little shoddy and unresponsive. I had to steal syrup from a neighboring empty table. -1/2 star.  The hours:  This is delicious, greasy, goodness. It'd be amazing drunk food if they were open late at night -- closed in the middle of the afternoon...what gives? -1/2 star.  THE BANANA WALNUT HOTCAKES: ARGHHHH SO FRUSTRATINGLY GOOD!!!! They are delicious, filling, crispy, succulent, flavorful, and so addicting. The only thing missing was the jar of Nutella that I should have brought.   THE CORNED BEEF HASH: This i saved for later, as the hotcakes were surprisingly filling. The potatoes were well cooked and it was a great salty break from my assault on the hotcakes.",

    "text": "A very popular weekend brunch place, with good reason.  The specialty pancakes are incredible, even if mine had so much brown sugar in it that I could literally feel the grains against my teeth.  That isn't a knock or praise, that's just how it is.  If that sounds good to you, you will love Pamela's...if that grosses you out, there's a GNC across the street, go make a protein shake.    They turn tables fast for a place this busy, and you get a lot of food for your hard earned cash (they only take cash, so hit up the PNC bank on the corner while you wait 20 minutes for a table).  The service is pretty quick since the wait staff doesn't seem to strictly ascribe to seating sections or table divisions the way the British and French carved up the Middle East (and look at all the problems THAT caused).  They also bring you your check with the food and get you off the table fast by making you pay up front.  I have no problems with any of this, Pennsylvanians are known in my home state for their efficiency and lack of skills operating watercraft.    Every decent U.S. City has a place like Pamela's, even some not-so-decent ones (that's right, I'm talking to you, Montgomery, and you, Little Rock).  Pittsburgh's specialty is the crepe like \"hotcakes\".  They are delicious, with lots of brown sugar (see above), and a faintly salty flavor along with a crispiness on the edges.  I tore that shit apart.",

Highlights: -The pancakes are definitely more like crepes than pancakes, which is a good thing. They're served rolled rather than flat with whipped cream and/or fruit and/or other toppings. -Home fries were fantastic! I get the feeling they may have been baked rather than fried, because they were sort of mushy instead of crispy, but no complaints. -$6.50 for an order of pancakes? I forget how cheap everything in Pittsburgh is. If I didn't have enough of a good experience to put me to five stars before, I reached that point when I saw the bill.  Go. Just go.

That seemed to be pretty standard so be prepared for that. Once we got in and ordered, the food came out almost immediately making the wait time more worth it. The hot cakes were delicious but be prepared for more buttery goodness than one should consume in a month. The potatoes were also half butter. I thought they tasted great if not a tad salty. The orange juice is more affordable than in most breakfast places but it wasn't mind blowing, I doubt it was fresh squeezed. My husband ordered eggs and hash which were also good but overly salty. We left feeling stuffed, guilty, and knowing that while the food was tasty our waistlines could only handle eating there once every couple of months.",

Of the diners I've been to, the home fries here have the most flavored. I honestly didn't even have to use the salt. Maybe just a pinch of pepper for added taste.  My only complaint is the limited amt of space in the restaurant. I hope they consider expanding because space is tight!  We went in the only day with winter coats, scarves, gloves and I felt like I had no room to breathe..  Plus, the distance between tables are so close that I ended up putting my coat and all misc stuff on my lap.  The two person tables are so small when you have coffee jug, condiments, syrup, large plates of food, etc etc.  You get the picture..  Overall, I would rate the place with only 3 stars considering all things.. However, the 4 stars reflect the food rating.",

Note: It is a smaller diner and can quickly accumulate a wait time should it be a peak time (due to the size of the restaurant). However, if you're not willing to wait for a seat, they have a sister restaurant upstairs that serves brunch, as well.  They offer a decent amount of breakfast and lunch options on their menu and the prices aren't too bad. My fiance and I went with the fan favorites (Tex Mex omelet and Gail's Favorite eggs). Both options came with toast and Lyonnaise potatoes.   My fiance really liked his omelet and I enjoyed my dish, as well. My only wish was that the eggs and toppings were blended because my eggs weren't warm enough to melt the cream cheese and it was hard to mix.   Our service was very fast and friendly and our food came out quickly after ordering (even with them being busy).   Oh, and before visiting, make sure you have cash as that is all they accept for payment!",

The line is always so long here - I waited about 45 minutes for a seat on a weekend morning but there's a lot of shopping nearby and the time goes by pretty quickly.   The corned beef hash with potatoes was not overly salty, a little greasy (but also this is a diner and sometimes you need a little grease), and a pretty huge portion to split with someone.   We also ordered the Morning After Breakfast Special which comes with 2 eggs, a meat, and hotcakes. We got the strawberry hotcakes and they were DELICIOUS. The hot cakes are not your average pancake - they are a little thicker than a crepe with delicious crispy edge and filled with sour cream, brown sugar, and fruit (depending on which one you order). They are perfect as is and I didn't even need any syrup on them.   Overall, a filling and soul satisfying meal that will not break the bank.",

But at the end of the day, one thing remains constant and that's the quality of the food.  I'm personally biased towards diners, and being to so many I've seen it all from down right disgusting to practically perfect. Pamela's is practically perfect when you think of a diner. Quick, delicious, no-frill American favorites. Two things that are a must every time you come are the Lyonnaise potatoes and the crepe-style hotcakes. Trust me, you will not be disappointed.

I was very excited since breakfast food is my favorite (so are burgers and those can be eaten as breakfast if you love yourself enough!) I was pretty disappointed tbh. There was nothing bad about the food, but definitely nothing special about it. \"What about the hotcakes though?!\" people have asked. Same thing I told ya before - nothing special. They were tasty, but it still wasn't enough to make me want to go back. I probably won't go back unless friends want to meet up there. Again, nothing bad about the place, but if I wanted some tasty trustworthy pancakes, I'd go to McDonald's (this is not a bad comment, I really do enjoy McD's hotcakes!)",

Look carefully because it's housed in the most inconspicuous building ever! Upstairs is this Peruvian restaurant called Feria that I would like to visit next time we're here.   The hotcakes translate to: the best pancakes I've ever had. I don't even like plain pancakes all that much but these are crepe-style with thin, crispy edges and a mound of butter. Mmm...goes perfectly with whipped cream and syrup. Their speciality potatoes are really good! They're made with sour cream, I believe, to give 'em that delicate softness.  Their eggs are unseasoned and small though, and it's pretty hard to mess up eggs. Every table comes equipped with hot sauce and syrup so that's a plus. The sausages are a bit dry too so definitely not their strength. Our waitress was very friendly and all the customers were really friendly too. I guess greasy breakfast food just puts everyone in a good mood?  It's cash-only and you don't get a real reciept. I would say the prices are on the higher side for the basic-ness. Portions are reasonable though. Yes, I would come back or at least try another location as well.",

It not only feels vintage inside, but they also only accept cash, giving it an older kind of vibe. The staff were friendly, but not in that overbearing sort of way. Very refreshing! They are very laid back, but still make sure you get what you want. I ordered the chorizo hash and it was quite a lot of food! I ate it all of course, and I don't even regret it. Even if I could hardly move for a few hours following :P The eggs were cooked perfectly (over easy) and the broken yolk tasted great on top of the chorizo and hash browns. Definitely a great place for hangover food! The entire meal with two entrees, a side of bacon, chocolate milk, and coffee was only $30. Compared to San Diego prices, I found this to be amazing! Hit it up if you ever find yourself in Pittsburgh!",

I got the Morning After Breakfast special with specialty hot cakes and a side of the potatoes, and it was so good. I didn't believe in the hype much, but after going, I can also solidly say that this place has one of the best diner breakfast foods. The eggs were delicious, the bacon perfect, and the banana chocolate chip hotcakes were heavenly. I'm more of a savory breakfast person, but I could NOT stop eating those hotcakes! However, the winner was definitely the potatoes. If you go, get the potatoes. They were amazing! My friend got the chorizo hash and oh my goodness, that is definitely what I'm getting the next time I get back! With a side of hotcakes of course! There is definitely a lot of food. We all had something to take home. Granted, you can see the grease on the plate, but that's what makes it SO good.   However, the service was one of the poorest I have ever received. Our waitress came over to get our order- no hi, no greeting, just \"what do you want\".  Then, we never saw her again. We ordered, and she wasn't part of the group bringing our food over. It wasn't a busy day. There were  empty tables, and she spent all of her time just hanging in the back. We were all out of water. No refills. No check up half way to see if the food was good, if we needed anything. Finally, at the end, I tried to make eye contact with her to see if I could get more water and if we could get to go boxes. We actually made eye contact. And held it. She just looked bored and annoyed and just kept staring with her hands crossed. Eventually, I got up and WENT TO HER. Asked her if we could have a to-go container. She asked how many, and just gave us the boxes. I smiled, thanked her, and told her to have a nice day. No response. Same blank stare. Eventually, we packed our three boxes and realized we didn't get a bag. My friend went and asked this time. We eventually realized there was just 1 bag. For 3 of us. At this point we just gave up. We all left a decent tip because I'm assuming they split their tips since other people brought our food over. Had it not been for that, I would have happily tipped much less if any at all. Having a waitress who is busy and can't get to you is one thing. Having one that purposefully lets you know she's ignoring is another. We all left RAVING about the food, but just disappointed at the experience.",

The crepe pancakes are plate sized, thinnish pancakes with deliciously and addictively crispy (fried) edges that lure you into eating more and more, even you're stuffed. The chorizo hash was spicy and delicious but pretty heavy, especially with the 3-egg scramble that accompanied it - toast also came with it but honestly I hate wasting food and wished I had asked them not to bring me any- it was excessive.  The burger looked good, and the heaping mound of onion rings along side it were crispy fried and tasty.  Not the best food ever but it hit the spot, and then some.",

Aerosol whipped cream, Minute Maid sold in a tiny glass at a huge markup, and frozen fruit that's been sitting out for who knows how long.

I was told dozens of times by native Pittsburghians about how Pamela's hotcakes are not only a Pittsburgh staple but a White House favorite.   Can't argue with that. I had the good fortune of sampling both the banana chocolate chip hotcakes as well as the banana walnut hotcakes--the former is by far superior, even if you're a nut fiend like yours truly. Perfectly crisped around the edges and delectably moist and sweet, the crepes are loaded with melted chocolate and banana slices. I will shamelessly admit to eating two orders... by myself.   However, the rest of the offerings at Pamela's are your typical diner fare, average at best. Come here for the hotcakes, then go home and sleep it off. Your day is done.  *Pamela's is cash-only and extremely busy on weekends. (On weekdays, service is surprisingly brisk.) *I recommend the Shadyside or Squirrel Hill locations over the one in Oakland.",

Sadly, I walked away from my meal with a \"meh\" feeling.  First off, I kept hearing about these pancakes I gotta try.  Well, I figured what better way to experience them than to order a short stack, right?  They were super buttery... Too much so.  I loved the thin fluffy texture, and the crispy edges were a unique touch, but those flap jacks were oozing butter (despite not using the included butter \"pat\" that comes with them)... It's all I could taste.  Too bad.  People generally recommended the stuffed pancakes... Perhaps this well teach me not to listen to the suggestions for the banana chocolate chip pancakes (next time).  My real disappointment was that the corned beef hash was probably just a few points above the stuff you can buy at the store.  If it weren't for the large pieces of crispy potatoes, or the sauteed onion... I would have sworn it came from a can.  Plus it was super salty and the meat over-ground... Kinda looked like pet food.  What happened to using chunks of real corned-beef and making the dish look like a hash?  I'm a transplant to pitt and I'm still figuring the place out.  Nevertheless, I'm still looking forward to trying some the other recommended food items... But... If you want really good authentic corned beef hash: Tasty Diner in Silver Spring, MD.

Perfect balance of sweet and savory, because it's filled with strawberries and like a cream cheese whipped cream and sprinkles of brown sugar...SO YUM.

I was going to give it 4 stars instead of 5 because there is ALWAYS a ridiculous wait during meal times.  You just have to expect that and set aside a whole morning or afternoon.  But I settled on 5 stars because, although it's a long wait to get a table, once you get one, the waiters are so fast and attentive, and my orders always come SUPER fast.  So in a way it kind of makes up for the wait.  [if you just hate waiting, you can also order for carry out; OH and another side-note, the crepes are EXCELLENT heated up in the oven later.  I'd usually eat half, take half home and eat the rest later]  Anyway, whenever you're in Pittsburgh, go here!  I sure do.",

The teenager nearly passed out from happiness over the chocolate chip waffle. The three year old had to closely protect his pancake because his mother and I kept stealing bites whenever he let his guard down. I had a chorizo hash special. It wasn't spicy, but neither was it underspiced and I enjoyed it to the last bite.  It wasn't diner prices, but I felt like it was fair.  While we waited, we stood over vent outside Prantl's to stay warm and enjoy the bakery aroma.",

    "text": "Maybe this is blasphemy of some sort, but Pamela's? I don't know what other people see in it.  There's always a line out the door, so I rarely end up going there.  Why wait when there are 600 million other places within walking distance?  It's cash only, which is basically a business's way of saying \"Hello, customer.  I really hate you, and want to make sure you have to go out of your way to find a way to pay me.\"  It's like when someone intentionally gets a 2-door car when a 4-door model is available.  You only do that if you really hate your passengers.  The food is, well, it's okay! But just okay.  The pancakes are super-greasy.  They're not bad, though.  I do have to put in a word for their corned beef hash, though, because evidently that is excellent.  I would like to one day try their lunch/dinner food, though.  One thing I do love about Pamela's is the price.  It's dirt cheap, and that's great.  But get a credit machine! It's not like you can't afford it! Stop abusing your customers!",

I obviously couldn't finish the whole thing or else I'd be in a food coma or turn diabetic from the rich brown sugar embedded between the layers or cream, butter, and magic, but it was one of the best breakfast pancakes/crepe variations I've ever had.  This is actually quite a big deal to me because I've had classic Paris crepes with Nutella, and this is up there on the \"omg you have to try it\" scale.  The quirky diner scene with checkered tables was a nice addition, and the staff is rather friendly. Apparently this place is crowded for brunch on weekends, but going on an overcast Tuesday morning at 9 seemed to work out well.  Anyway, if you're in Pittsburgh, you must try this place.

I also really like their corned beef hash. I'll usually get some sort of omelette and pair it with a hotcake (usually chocolate but blueberry is pretty good too). I'll then make sure there is plenty of home fries and get a side of the corned beef hash. This usually puts me in a food coma but makes me feel fantastic especially after waking up a little hungover or still drunk from the night before.  Oh. you have to pay with cash.

It passed the \"parking lot\" or rather waiting room test and was packed to the the brim on Saturday at 11am... Perfect, this means we are at the right place for a good breakfast. Only a short wait later we were seated comfortably at a table.  Great signage to say that they were a \"CASH ONLY\" establishment. Thanks for not making it awkward at the end....  Overall the food was excellent. I had a Hotcake with Walnuts and Bananas... I wished it came with some sort of side because I was still hungry afwards.  My friend had a omelet with home fries which she said was delicious as well.  It wasn't life changing and innovative, but the food was excellent for a brunch location in Pittsburgh. Loved Walnut street as well. Beautiful location for a breakfast spot.  Parking wasn't so bad either!   See you next time Pamela's!",

The interior of this place is cozily modern, and the food is fantastic:  - Home fries: cooked to a mealy perfection, then smashed before frying in order to maximize their crisp-able surface area. They must put some kind of cheese in them to get it that lovely golden brown color and perfectly crunchy texture.  - Hotcakes: kind of like a thick crepe, but better. Each bite is different - sometimes sweet, sometimes a little saltier, fruitier, other times crunchier. Delicious every single time.  - Omelettes: Their egg white omelettes do a great job posing as normal eggs. The fillings are fresh and flavorful without overpowering the flavor of the egg.  - Toast: Yes, even their toast is excellent. Crisp on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside. And their toast comes pre-buttered - taking care of that pesky cold-butter-on-hard-toast problem.  It's greasy spoon brunch fare at its very best. My parents ate here two days in a row, which says a lot because they're Asians from Asia and typically don't like greasy American-style brunch foods. I'm an Asian from America and typically don't like to agree with my parents, but I'll make an exception for Pamela's. This place is amazing.",

We didn't know what to expect and we knew ahead of time that it's cash only which is no big deal since there's an ATM right around the corner from the restaurant and up and down the street basically.  We didn't wait to long, their waiting room/hostess could be a little more welcoming though.  The space looks crowded and you're a bit overwhelmed when you first walk in but when you sit down you realize that the tables are actually spread apart enough that you don't feel too crowded. Each table has enough distance that you feel comfortable and you can talk with the people at your table.  The waitress was nice and we got our food very quickly.  So the service was fast and attentive.  And the food was delicious! We got the Morning after Breakfast Special and it was so good. We all ate everything off our plates. I would've ordered another side of the Lyonnaise potatoes if I wasn't so full from all the yummy food.  The only beef I have about the restaurant was that the waitress basically put the check on our table without telling us.  We found it under one of our glasses on the table.  She never announced it and also she never showed up at our table after that. And that was right at the beginning of our meal.  My family wanted more coffee and drinks but she never showed up.    All in all, the food is great, I definitely recommend going there.  But the service could be a little better. I felt like we got there, got our food and then they wanted us out asap.",

The majority of the rest of the food is horribly underseasoned. That corned beef hash was an absolute joke. It's legit just the regular potatoes with corned beef sprinkled in, not cooked to meld all the flavors or anything.   As of late, coming to Pamela's is a hassle.

Per the bf's suggestion, we went to Pamela's for brunch, on our first stop of our day trip in Pittsburgh. Hmmm..... a brunch place, you say? Why not! Cool decor inside- half hipster, half well....midwest diner. Our wait wasn't really that long- we put in our name at around 11:30am on the Saturday of Labor Day weekend, and was seated within 30 minutes. In the meantime while we waited, we checked out the cool Mexican place above Pamela's. Cool.  He got the standard breakfast special - which was standard, there's no way to really rate that stuff- and choc chip banana hotcakes. I ordered the blueberry hotcakes.  His choc chip banana hotcakes were so so good. Bananas stuffed into a thin crepe of a pancake with the chocolate all melting inside.....omg, it was good. My blueberry crepe pancakes seemed to be extra crispy (which I liked, by the way) with brown sugar and sour cream in it. I felt like there needed to be more stuffing in it, but it was still pretty good.  Coffee was standard here as well. But I LOVEEEeeee diners, so this was a place that was above your normal diner. Cool. I still crave those crepe hotcakes....",

Naturally, with all the high ratings we saw on Yelp! for Pamela's, we gave it a shot.  I have to ask: What is all the fuss about this place?  My companion and I were a little dismayed to see it was a cash-only place, but luckily in Shadyside there is a PNC just up the street. The restaurant was fairly busy with lots of customers chatting at their tables. It wasn't an uninviting atmosphere, more laid-back, but also a little indifferent, if that makes any sense. Our waitress wasn't unfriendly, but didn't really go out of her way to talk much with us.  After perusing the menu for a bit, the fella ordered a Greek salad with chicken while I went for the crepe-hotcake dish. Food came out pretty fast, but that was sadly the best part about it.  My companion's tiny salad was served in a large silver bowl, like the chef had mixed it up and decided better of putting it on an actual plate. The Greek dressing was saturated with lemon flavor, way too tart and sour, and the chicken was pretty paltry for the price.  My crepe-hotcake thingies were okay, but very oily and griddle-tasting. Way too rich to finish.  Overall, we found ourselves very underwhelmed with Pamela's. Our search for a good brunch place continues.",

Crowded on a Saturday morning, and even though they said the wait was twenty minutes, we were seated in two, and we were served our food just as unexpectedly quickly. Silver seal of approval :].",

    "text": "So, I will start by saying that I no longer live in Pittsburgh (Shadyside) but during the two years that I did, I went to Pamela's just about every weekend for their AMAZING crepe style hotcakes. I have never had anything like them - nor have I been successful in trying to make copycat recipes at home, much to my dismay. Now that I have moved away from Pgh, I have such huge cravings for these things and it is a shame that they are not readily available. For those that aren't into eating sweets for breakfast, just about everything I ever ordered was delicious. If visiting Pgh, this is an absolute MUST. You deserve a swift kick in the shins if you pass this breakfast place up. Cheers!",

    "text": "I used to love Pamela's because the chocolate chip hotcakes taste exactly like big, warm chocolate chip cookies, but the last time I ate here, I had such a bad experience that I lost all interest in ever coming back.   I understand that diner-y restaurants use a lot of butter. In fact, I think that all restaurants use a lot of butter, but the last time I ordered the chocolate chip hotcakes, they were so buttery that there was a butter foam ring 2\" wide around the rim of each hotcake, and pressing on the hotcake with my fork caused wet liquid butter to ooze out. The hotcakes just tasted like a stick of butter. Disgraced chef Paula Deen has taught us that butter is the best, but this was just ridiculous and completely turned me off of Pamela's.",

(which was akin to a Mumbai locker room) or the fact that this place is most likely owned by the Gambino Crime Family....\"Cash Only.\" The wait is probably the most enjoyable part of this restaurant...which is at least 15-20 min. Our food arrived before we could take off our coats and the check came before I took my first bite of grease. The corned beef looked like mashed goat brains and the pancakes reminded me of Ethiopian sponge bread (apologies to Ethiopia). This is my second time at Pamela's (the first being above average) and most likely my last....unless for some reason I crave food poisoning.",

The portions are huge and get ready to run a few miles after digesting as the food is super greasy and rich but totally delicious. The strawberry hotcakes were amazing! The crispy edges of a thin pancake crepe were soooo good!!! Also we had the famous corn beef hash and it was impossible to finish, soooo greasy but full of flavor, just make sure to drizzle with hot sauce. We also ordered bacon, it was just OK so I would skip it next time. Overall this was a great diner, friendly and super fast service as well. I can see why it's so popular with the locals!",

The food (best known for the famous hotcakes) is delicious and I always get the banana and chocolate hotcakes. It is truly a testament to the Pamela's deliciousness that when Michelle Obama visited Pittsburgh and ate at Pamela's, she asked the White House chef to get the hotcakes recipe to make for her at home. The hotcakes are truly decadent and probably have more butter and saturated fat than everything you've eaten today combined. But it's a wonderful calorie splurge every once in a while! Know that the wait is typically long (especially for Saturday and Sunday mornings) and it is cash-only, if memory serves.",

    "text": "Ok, I finally get it. After being in Pittsburgh now for over 2 years and hearing all of the hype about this place, I finally tried it out. Delicious!  After reading the menu and seeing the strawberry hotcakes, I decided to order that. I was a little apprehensive because it seemed like it was their version of a crepe, and it had strawberries, brown sugar and sour cream on the inside. Sour cream?...sounded a little weird to me. But I thought, oh what the hell.   So it came out with whipped bream on top and after I took my first bite, it all made sense to me. It was delicious! The strawberries were super fresh too. Surprisingly, it wasn't too sweet either. I also got a side of bacon and home fries. It tasted like some good home cooking; the home fries reminded me of some of the best southern cooking I have had. My fiance ordered a waffle, and was far from disappointed as well.  The service from our waiter was great as well. He was very gracious and welcoming, regardless that he was obviously very busy. As far as environment, I wouldn't go here if you're looking for a relaxing one. It gets quite loud and you are sitting inches away from the next table.But if you don't mind that and you're looking for some good home-style cooking, especially a good stick-to-your ribs breakfast, this place is perfect for that.",

    "text": "I have not written a review for Pamela's in the past mostly because it feels wrong saying anything negative, due to the fact that it's almost a Pittsburgh institution- It's like dissing the Steelers; You don't do it, even if they lose!- And I would really have never given it more than a couple stars.   That being said, I realized something recently when the BF and I went for breakfast...I'm not such a fan of the lunch nosh, but I love it for breakfast. For me, breakfast should be a greasy spoon-ish type experience. I want eggs and sausage and potatoes, all cooked to greasy perfection on a griddle type apparatus, and Pamela's does it very well. I don't really like pancakes, but even I have to admit the chocolate chip crepes are pretty good. And don't get me started on their famous Lyonnaise potatoes...  I had the sausage and cheese omelet and the BF had the chorizo hash and eggs. His was good with the slightly spicy chorizo and hash, topped with a dollop of sour cream, and my was great; oozing with cheese and stuffed with sausage. Add the toast and yummy potatoes and you get enough food for at least two for like $8 or $9 bucks! But I still scarfed my down all by myself.   As far as the staff are concerned, I'm a bit biased (I have many friends who work there), so I will only say I have never heard of anyone having a problem there. And if you have, it was probably your fault.   Overall, I would probably give it 3.5 stars if I could, but as Yelp has yet to let us designate half stars, I am going with 3 stars, giving 4 for breakfast and 2 for lunch.",

The eggs were also of epic proportions but the bacon was quite scarce. A measly two and a half pieces...  The jumbo tossed salad was built for a king - it was brought out in the large mixing bowl that they tossed that sucker in. I asked for cheddar and dressing on the side and it was quite scrumptious.",

So how does banana walnut crepes on Walnut Street sound like!? Why not.  I ended up ordering some and they even split the 1 order of crepe into 2 plates and loaded them for us which was nice. Their famous crepes weren't so amazing as I hoped they were barely OK for me, they are just crepes. I would have like to try more the menu but I only had like $10 in bills and coins. And again another place that only takes cash really. I don't get it.  If you're ever here with nothing but $10 in bills and coins you order wisely.  You start looking over their menu and notice wow everything's famous, famous lyonnaise potatoes, famous crepe, famous corned beef hash, famous egg salad, etc. haha.  Don't waste your time with the crepes for about the same price or a little more, you should go for something else on menu, everything's under $10 and inexpensive.  Stretch your dollar and order a soft drinks that has free refills and bottomless coffee or just order a water.  They have lots of different omelets and sandwiches.   Inside there are a lot of seating, tables and chairs are old and so are everything else about it.  There's a wall of photos in the back wall.  Service was friendly and I had to tip in coins. But I'd try one of the other locations or something else. Other possible MEH but I'll leave it as a OK.  \"18% gratuity may be added to parties over 6\" on the menu, does that mean that if I'm nice enough I don't have to pay?",

Highly recommended to get at least one hotcake (it's pretty big). Also tried their corned hash which was pretty good but not nearly as special. The location is pretty fun as well especially if you're not from the area since it's on a street with a decent amount of shops to walk around.",

The restaurant is smaller than the strip one.  It's clean and the staff were friendly.  You must try it!  Bring your cash, because it's cash only.",

(Usually for me, it's the latter, because I'm a lazy mofo.)   I came here a few weeks ago when I was home in Pittsburgh for Thanksgiving with my lovely boyfriend, Sean. We called in advance to make sure the place wasn't swamped. Because believe you me, Pamela's has a tendency to get swamped despite turnover being fairly quick among restaurants of its kind. Luckily the woman on the phone said no wait for two, so we walked on over from my doctor's office on Aiken. Upon arrival, we could see that it had become noticeably more busy since our phone call about 10 minutes prior and I was worried there'd be a wait....well...there wasn't a wait at all! It was beauteous!   Our waitress was super sweet and attentive. She immediately took our orders and the food came out in about 5-10mins of time later. Super quick! I had the special strawberry pancakes with sour cream and brown sugar...and don't forget the freshly chopped strawberries! Mmm. The only thing I don't like is their generic watery syrup but I guess you don't really want genuine maple syrup on something as sugary as the special strawberry pancakes. Would be too sugary, most likely! But having that option would be cool for those among us who are syrup junkies, lol. He ordered the \"American\" French toast since he prefers his F.T. as plain as can be...without all of the raisins and cinnamon and jam. I tried a bite of it and it was pretty good but nothing beats their hotcakes.  Despite going to almost every Pamela's location repeatedly in highschool, I totally forgot that they only accept cash--NO credit cards at all! I had to text my dad who was able to bring me a fist fulla' dollars to pay for our meal. My bad. It's kind of weird that they don't take CC's but I guess they want to keep their prices low as it probably costs them every time they swipe a card. You'd think I'd remember that by now, but I always forget. lol.  Anyway I took Sean here because he's never been to Pittsburgh and I wanted to give them \"the experience\" by taking him to. as Amy R. put it, a \"Pittsburgh staple.\" We had a great time and left with full--but not exploding--stomachs.",

But the good news is the focal point will be walls of pittsburgh everyday people young and old done by local artist and muralist Sandy Kessler Kaminski. Give us another try in August. Art takes time. But no matter what we still have the same Hotcakes and homefries. Hope to see you soon. Gail Klingensmith",
