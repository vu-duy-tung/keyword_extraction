These tamales were one of the best tasting ones I've ever had! All their lunch entrees come with a salad and their salads are some of the best tasting mixes you'll find anywhere, all with local and organic ingredients. Given the quality of the food, the prices are very reasonable. I can't wait to stop by to try some of their pastries/dessert next time - lots to select from, including biscotti, cupcakes, mini cheesecakes, and cake pops (and some are even gluten-free!)",

    "text": "A friend took me here for lunch. She said it was one of her favorite places to eat. The menu is limited to a handful of selections. The owner/chef was confident, pleasant and accommodating. After we ordered we went upstairs to the terrace. It was private and serene. The food came (served by the owner) and it was all so amazingly delicious. The portions were ample and the service was just the right amount of attentiveness. The cappucino and dessert topped the meal. Here's why I'm giving Cafe Chocolade the full five stars: 1.  The chef really knows his stuff!  Check out his website and read his credentials. Impressive.  2.  Although I don't really even know what it means to be gluten-free, the gluten free items I had here were fantastic. 3.  This is a small family business that lovingly creates meals for the rest of us to savor and enjoy.  What a gift! This guy's passion is evident and that alone makes me want to keep coming back. Many thanks.",

It didn't look like a restaurant from the outside, but it's a small cozy place with a nice variety of delicious pastries.  The menu changes daily as mentioned by the chef.  I ordered the crab cake souffle with a salad and a chocolate cupcake.  The souffle was heavenly and the cupcake was moist, the melt in your mouth kind of thing.  I'll stop by the next time I am in Pittsburg.",

    "text": "Went here because of all the amazing reviews and was disappointed. I must have caught them on a bad day or something because I was getting no where with the people running the place. I walked in to the little place excited to try a new place. I greeted the people over the counter since their social skills weren't fully there. I said I was new to the place and I wasn't sure if I should order and then sit or wait to be seated. A good question I thought at the time since there were no instructions anywhere. The girl over the counter just stared at me as though id asked the strangest question in the world and just said it's up to you I guess. I then asked for a menu. It was another odd question apparently because she began to tell me that whatever was in the showcase was it. I asked if they served food or was it only desserts? She turned around to look at the chef in the back and he came forward and told me the same thing. I guess they don't serve food I wouldn't know. It was feeling very awkward so I asked for a slice of some chocolate cake that was displayed and decided to leave with it. As far as the piece of cake it was good but I can't tell you what the name of the item was. It was the most peculiar place I've ever been. If I ever decide to go back, I hope to get some service. It's a shame too. I really like supporting smaller businesses by spreading the word. I'm sad to sad I don't have a lot of great things to say about this place. If you go here order out. I'm sure this is what the owners may prefer.",

The salad was one of the best we've ever had, replete with bocconcini, grapes, blueberries, blackberries, grape  tomatoes, carrots, cucumber, peppers, sugar snap peas and thin green beans on a great mix of greens, and with a terrific balsamic vinaigrette.  The basil mozzarella quiche was fluffy and also had a good heft of cheese but was slightly bland.  The pasta with mushroom sauce was heavenly, creamy and delightfully 'shroomy.  The servings were quite ample.  The coffee was rich and flavorful, and we bought some beans to take home.  The restaurant is adorable and the service was tiptop!    We look forward to eating the yummy-looking pastry at home that we purchased, AND to coming back here again for another meal!",

So the owner is the only one working here .... which means he is the chef, waiter, barrista, cashier, greeter, and probably dishwasher. I mean when he gets mad he probably has to yell at himself .... because there is no one else. His wife runs a salon joint upstairs, but from my experience women don't take well to getting yelled at. So aside from that the food is great. The jack of all trades guy changes his menu weekly and after 3 visits I am still impressed. The salmon was great and the side salads are phenominal. The cakes, pastries and chocolates are also very good and reasonably priced. Oh, he makes those too ... I don't think he has time to watch Game of Throwns or other things because he is a slave to the food.  Make sure you check out the hours since they are limited.... again um one man show.",

The quality is easily better than many of the most top quality gluten free products I've enjoyed at restaurants, cafes and bakeries across the country. Many of the items are so delicious that I often have to double and triple check whether or not they are in fact gluten free. The constantly changing weekly menus for cafe lunch items are posted at the beginning of the week and many times I find myself planning my weekly travels around what's being served on any given day. Top recommendations would have to be the GF Pirogies, Veggies And Pasta, chocolate cake with raspberry layers, mocha brownies, large soft pretzels, cheese bread, chocolate and farmer's cheese mousse and even the dog biscuits have seemed to be a hit. If you're passing through or live in the area and you are gluten free, or not, cafe chocolate is a must.",

Determined to avoid the chains, we consulted the great Yelp, and low and behold, this little jem arose.  From the outside it doesn't look like much, but inside you're presented with a cozy little cafe that has 2 tables, a few couches, etc.  The chef is extremely personable and was thrilled to see new clientele walking in.  We decided to get the lunch special (chicken wrap with brie cheese and a fantastic balsalmic salad), a prosciutto croissant, and an apple turnover.  The special.  All in all great... the salad was the real star of the show here.  The wrap was great where the brie has melted down to mold a great set of flavors together, but was inconsistent at times.  The apple turnover, while it looked fantastic, was average.  But, the croissant...  oh the croissant.  Big.  Flakey.  Buttery.  Cheesy.  Meaty.  I could have taken a dozen to go and only been left with one by the time we got home.  We'll definitely check this place out again.  Didn't get into any of the chocolates, etc. in the case, but they definitely dictate a follow-up.",

The place was small and menu items are few. But the food dazzled my taste-buds!  The owners are a warm and welcoming couple.  James has over 20 years of bakery experience in Europe and the US.  The lunch choices for the day were a smoked salmon sandwich on a croissant and a pierogi crepe. We got one of each. The smoked salmon was just right. It was nestled on a fresh baked beautiful croissant with farm fresh veggies and a mascarpone aioli. It was simply divine! The croissant was flaky but soft and the flavors just worked so well together. The crepe was filled with a delicious garlic potato mix. I loved this combination of texture and taste. Both entrees were served with a side salad. I don't even know how to describe the goodness of this salad. Fresh field greens, slivered almonds, grapes, cherry tomatoes, carrots, cucumber, red pepper and baby mozzarella were drizzled with a balsamic olive oil dressing garnished with home made croutons. I just drooled a little while reminiscing! Needless to say this was one of the best lunches I've had. The portion size was easily enough for a lunch for two or a lunch with left over.  The cafe roasts it's own coffee beans so the coffee is smooth and fragrant. We also bought a chocolate cupcake with rich ganache icing that I am saving to enjoy later. You won't regret a trip to this amazing spot. There will be many more trips and explorations of this gem of a place. It rates a 10 plus on the 'yumm' factor. J'adore Cafe Chocolade!",

You won't be disappointed.   My husband and I have eaten here numerous times and the food is simply delicious.  From Salmon entrees to Crab Cakes to Quiches...all made with the freshest ingredients and their side salad could be a meal itself.  Home grown produce...from their garden...you really can taste the difference.  Plus...their Baked breads, pies, cupcakes, biscotti are just so yummy.  They have a great variety of gluten free desserts too and my dogs love their home baked doggie bones.   I had walnut cookies from here last year that were to die for!  Treat yourself and go...you will be delighted!",

There are two (or more) lunch specials per day, posted on the web site at the start of the week, served with a large side salad including a huge array of fresh vegetables, homemade croutons, and fresh mozzarella.  My friends had the lobster ravioli, which looked amazing, while I had the grilled veggie wrap.  Totally worth the $9.50-11 price for the portion size and quality of ingredients.  There's a large variety of baked goods, including breads, cookies, pretzels, quiche, pies, tarts, and more.  It's smallish, but there is room for about 4 parties to sit at a time. Coffee and an array of sodas are available too. Very cozy.  Stop in soon!",

There is so little for Gfree folks in this area, so the fact that this wonderful bakery exists out in the \"airport area\" is a small miracle! Yes, the prices are high, but that is reality.

Me and my girlfriend had been thinking about planning a trip out to this place because the menu looks good and there are vegan dishes that also seemed wonderful.  We went there just after 1 p.m. on a Saturday and the guy behind the counter says, \"It's gone,\" or something completely short and dismissive.  I spoke to him and said, \"You mean the entire menu?\"  He says, \"yah, everything.\"  All he had was some dry pasta's, macarons and one kind of vegan cake.  He had nothing that he could cook us for lunch, or dinner later.  Now, how does an entire restaurant get wiped out of all of their menu items only an hour after lunch?  I mean he had nothing that he could make us off of the menu.  I was irritated, but his attitude made me even more irate.  He keeps going on about how great he is and how another bakery can't make good macarons when this guy can't serve a single thing for lunch.  What is this place anyways?  Is it a bakery?  Is it a cafe?  Is it a restaurant?  No, it's a place that tries to do all of these things and fails miserably at all three.  Oh and about the way he took jibes at another local bakery....I had a vegan cake that he made and it sucks.  The cake was tough.  It was chewy and horrible.  He said that he would not try to make a vegan macaron because it would not be up to his high standards.  That's just a lame excuse from a lame ass, conceited, miserable failure.",

I had been meaning to come here for a while and I finally did, and I cannot believe how good it was, why was there not a line outside.   Came here with my lady, as it was only 4 mins down the road on which I live. Walked into a house-like lounge-like cafe. Walked to the counter and a man greeted us. This guy had the most down to earth vibe a man could have. Not sure of the order of operations at the restaurant I told him that I had been meaning to visit and try the salads I had heard about (the best salads in Pittsburgh)- he calmly smirked on that comment (as if he knew, we knew he knew, and he knew we knew) he then asked if we knew what we wanted. There were only to food options. We got the shrimp scampi with a salad. and sat. Note that he had an awesome selection of craft sodas and drinks.    The right side of the cafe coming in has comfortable little seating area with a couch and also a table for two- thats where we sat.   After a little waiting he brought out the salads with shrimp- AND BOY WAS IT A SALAD. Im talking grapes. balls of Parmesan, an array of different greens, hand made croutons, seeds/nuts, red pepper slices, carrots, a radish, topped with homemade balsamic vinaigrette. Then came the shrimp, succulent and cooked to perfection- it tasted unbelievable on point with a perfect mix of flavors that did not overwhelm but complimented each other perfectly.   Then came dessert- my god the macaroons were perfect. But my favorite was the pistachio chocolate tart and the craft beer cupcake(of his choosing)- all topped off with a cappuccino.   A little pricey yes- but you are paying for quality ingredients, healthy food,  and a handmade product! I will return and talk this place up. Frankly I am surprised there isn't a line to the parking lot.",

I've also ordered the handmade vegan burgers, my fav was the beet and walnut burger.  The cupcakes are wonderful and the macarons!  I didn't even know it was possible to make them vegan!  He also creates wonderful vegan cheeses and awesome pickles or all sorts... I love Cafe Chocolade! So this place is very small.  It is a one man show and he is so nice.  He speaks english well, but sometimes there is a small communication barrier.  Be patient it is not rudeness :-)  The hours are narrow, and if you have your heart set on something, call or email in advance.  Everything is fresh - so it does run out and they close earlier than most full service restaurants.  My cheat... I like to order and pick up on my way home from work for dinner ;-)",

The owner is very knowledgeable on cross contamination and completely sanitizes his stainless steal counters before he prepares his gluten free baked goods and the cafe is immaculately clean. The food is amazing. He always has a wide selection of GF pastries. I special order GF bakery items and they taste amazing, you would not be able to tell most of his GF items are GF by taste. This is Gluten free heaven :)  It is a bit pricey for a meal, usually $14 for the meal of the day with a fresh salad with tomatoes, bell peppers on the side. It is hard to find a quick restaurant in Pittsburgh that offers fresh ingredients so I usually splurge.   The owner's personality is unique. I have seen him snap at customers a bit if they ask something he feels they should already know the answer to, but his attention to detail in preparing food makes up for that.   I would rather pay a fe extra dollars to have fresh food in an immaculately clean cafe.   Definitely visit!!!!",

Something as simple as a side salad is so fresh, hand made and tailored to be perfect. A cupcake isn't just a cupcake here- it's German chocolate or its hand made decorated chocolate peices, or its filled with fresh fruit... basically, anything simple at any other restaurant is ART at Cafe Chocolade.   There are always 2 or 3 options for lunch, and I usually go on the website to check out what he is having! The owner is a world renowned chef and I cannot stress enough-EVERYTHING is carefully crafted and home made. It's not a fast food place and if the prices (still average) deter you, please understand how much work is put into something simple as his freshly daily baked bread. He is an artist. Side note- above the store is Anika's Spa. I always ask for gift cards for my birthday and have gotten massages there. Anika is his wife, and she is also a fabulous masseuse, manicurist, and more. I could rave for hours about these two places- you MUST check them out!!!",

The sandwich had mozzarella, pesto, tomato and a few capers scattered throughout - it hit the spot!  There was so much flavor to the sandwich that I was a bit surprised because I typically can only taste the mozzarella and tomato with these type of sandwiches.    The salad was no joke - I'm talking about a variety of fresh veggies, not just a whole bunch of leaves with a light sprinkle of vegetables.  From what I remember there were carrots, cucumbers, tomatoes, peppers, mushrooms, slivered almonds and awesome croutons (crispy and chewy) atop mixed greens with a light balsamic glaze.    Everything tasted fresh and was made on the spot.  We were the only ones there for lunch that day so service was efficient but since the owner/chef is the only one running this place be patient if there's a crowd.  He's a one man show - chef, waiter and cashier!  Check this place out...now!",

It's a bit off the beaten path, but so worth the drive just a few minutes from Settlers Ridge in Robinson.  It's a tiny spot, but very cute with some indoor and outdoor seating to eat there. I was more interested in their GF baked goods and let me say that the macaroons did not disappoint!! Chocolate, Raspberry, Chocolate Pistachio and Vanilla; I don't think it's possible to pick a favorite since they were all so good! I couldn't even tell the difference of them being GF.  The owner is a quiet and soft spoken man, but very polite and nice. It was busy this afternoon, which is so nice to see patrons supporting a small, local business like this one. I can't wait to go back and try his weekly changing food (lunch) menu. Hello, he is serving avocado fries this week?!",

    "text": "One of the things I enjoy is promoting small businesses and Cafe Chocolade is no exception. I met the owner and chef James who explained to me that everything here is gluten free. They even have a few vegan items available that are gluten free as well.  There is a grab and go for pastas, donuts, quiches, etc, and a small sit down dining area. Beverages are also available in an adjoining refrigerator. I learned that Sat. brunch has now been added to the menu.  Breads are available as well as I noted on the menu. I believe advance notice is required if ordering the breads.  I was eyeing a vegan donut that reminded me of a Whoopie pie. James told me how to prepare it and while we were chatting I decided to eat it in house. He prepared it and put it on a dish with a fork and asked if I needed anything. I was good with what he had given me. I'm a sucker for chocolate and this donut was literally to die for! Even though it had a cream style filling between the two halves it was not too filling. I took the vegan quiche home with me to heat up on my own. I'm sure I won't be disappointed.   Coffee is available which I plan to try. He told me it comes from Ohio. I liked the fact that everything is made fresh in house. Did I forget to mention the homemade candy? Got to have some next time I come here. Small macaroons are available as well. I looked over the menus and am looking forward to a return trip here so I can enjoy a sit down meal.  This is an easy drive if you are in the Robinson Twp area. Take the Rt 22-30 W off the parkway and then take the first exit that leads to Steubenville  Pike. You aren't that far from Robinson Town Center or the restaurants nearby. James was very informative and helpful. A great place for gluten free and vegan dining or if you want to just try it out for yourself. I'll most certainly be back!",

You just have to experience it. I can only say that it is such a joy for me to go to go this Cafe and bakery.  First of all James runs his place by his own rules and he has every right to do that and people will keep coming back and he will continue to win rewards. I happen to be fascinated with his experience, world wide training and talent.  It is a small place in Oakdale PA with limited seating but the flavors and beauty is huge. Their signature salad is very very good with grapes slivered almonds, sweet peas, yellow squash, etc.  I think ACF Gluten free place and are Vegan friendly. All you need to do is let him know your restrictions are.....egg free? Oat free? Dairy free? He will do his best to accommodate.  Keep in mind that everything is made from scratch so he may run out of items or it might take longer to prepare. He has wonderful bakery items including heart shaped bread for Valentines Day, cakes and pastas. He changes it menu so it's best to call ahead. It is a feast for your eyes nose and taste buds.",

However, the atmosphere was very homey and there are a variety of vegan/vegetarian/gluten free entrees and desserts, so if you have specific dietary restrictions but want a lot of options to choose from, Cafe Chocolade is the place for you!",

    "text": "I was in Pittsburgh just for the day and needed a place to get a hot drink and a snack on the way to my meeting from the airport, so I decided to stop here based on the reviews. I walked in and was... baffled. It felt like a tiny cramped doctor's office waiting room, but instead of chairs ringing the room, there were a few chairs and tables where you could sit and order food. And there was a dividing wall between this small seating space and the counter, making it even more claustrophobic. The space behind the counter was also cramped. The environment did not communicate \"cafe\" at all. I wasn't even sure you could order tea or coffee to go.   Everything in the glass display was either vegan or gluten free or both. There were some tiny brightly colored macarons, some fancy cakes, a couple chocolates and some other desserts. It looked like there were many more lunch options on the menu, but i needed something quick to go, so I picked something from the case:  the vegan quiche with leeks and onions.  And it was truly horrible. It was rubbery and oddly watery. I picked it up to take a bite and a ton of liquid squirted out in all directions, including my skirt. I set that aside for good.   I had to spend at least $10 to use a credit card, so I also got a piece of fancy looking vegan cake, which was quite delicious. There was only one employee there, the chef, who waited on me in his chef coat in a very absent minded way. As I stood there waiting to be helped, he started talking, so I responded, only to find out he was talking to himself and was writing something down so he wouldn't forget. The set up and service were rather bizarre, and the food inconsistent, so I won't be back.",

    "text": "Found this place just by chance. My boys and i are gluten and dairy free bc of wicked allergies. It's SO HARD to find good food. We ordered the avocado fries. Super tasty but needed a touch more salt for my palate. No biggie. they were cooked perfectly and the sauce had a touch of smoky hotness but even  my 5 yr old loved the fries. I loved them too.  Got two vegan desserts (cheesecake and eclair type dessert). My boys thought cheesecake was just ok but they LOVED the other. I liked both.  Then ordered vegan margarita pizza. It was the size of a small pie and was 4 small slices. Basically a personal pizza.  It has no sauce.  Instead it's a sweet balsamic syrup with a little pesto and olive oil plus daiya mozzarella cheese.  Almost Looks like it's chocolate pizza.  My boys were super hesitant.  I begged them to taste just one bite.  Once the pizza touched their lips their eyes bugged out of their head and i never got any! In fact i had to order my 5&7 yr old boys a second one!  The food is SPECTACULAR and of course pricey but understandable.  Our bill for 4 drinks, two cooked pizzas, avocado fries, and two desserts was $52.   I added on two raw dough pizza crusts to take home and the bill went to a whopping $72. (Each Crust is $8) but this amount also includes tip.  The cook?  Well .......let's just call a spade a spade. The guy's a total douche.  He absolutely does not win personality awards.  He's quiet,a touch uncomfortable, and eery. He was intensely watching my boys as if they were gonna tear up the place. I guess in today's world i don't blame him bc most kids ARE crazy and most parents DONT watch their kids let alone discipline them.  Sadly my homeschooled boys get lumped in wkth the crazies even though they are extremely well behaved.  He became angry when i asked for the lunch special that was listed on the road sign, stating \"nope!!\"....confused i asked what he said and he stated very irritable \"i don't have that! do you want something else or what???\".......honest to Pete i just looked at him and totally lost it with an uncontrolled laughter at his attempt to work with the public when he's clearly a \"don't look or talk to me\" office kind of guy. He didn't like that. I didn't care. it became a little awkward so i gradually composed myself.  Eh whatever.  So long as you're not going there to make a new BFF with the guy, and simply going in for the food  and not pinching pennies that week? Then you're DEFINITELY in luck.  This place is a True gem food wise.  It's a keeper for us. The food is amazing.",

I love that they're taking a chance (as is every locally owned business) in an area they want to settle in.   While this is a little off the beaten path, I was very pleasantly surprised with my experience. Everything is made in house, even down to the pasta. And don't let me forget the beautiful pastries... more on that later.  It's a very casual environment, with only a handful of seats. Plus, the menu is very limited, so don't expect to be leafing through pages and pages. But sometimes I think that's almost better, as you're not stuck weeding through too many dishes.  We made the best decision possible, splitting our pasta's between a seafood ravioli and sausage and spiral pasta dish with red sauce. You also get a delicious side salad. But it's more of a main salad because it's filled with cucumbers, beans, grapes, tomatoes and dressed with a delicious house made balsamic dressing. I was highly impressed with everything and full until way past 8pm!  BUT it didn't just end with a meal, we also had to have dessert, becauase the case looked so tantalizing. They make macaroons, but they also have mini-macaroons that are the cutest things ever. Such a good idea for someone that wants to taste all the different flavors and not feel like their gorging themselves.   We picked out almost every flavor and split about 15 or so. Seems like a lot, but like I said, they were mini and worth every bite. The flavors are incredible and those small portions still packed a big punch.   If you're in the Robinson area, scrap the trip to Bravo and head here instead!",

I enjoyed talking to him and watching him cook.  I was interested in his desserts and he spent the time talking to me about all of them.  Next time I will have desserts for sure! They are too beautiful to pass up and most are gluten free!!!",

I said is the a avocado pasta stuffed with avocado or just made from avocado? Starts waving his hands in the air like it's self explanatory.  He must be already wealthy and not need new customers. Don't waste your time unless you want you want bullshit with your meal!!!",

Practically everything is made from scratch but the owner and Chef - Jim.   Salads, pizza, tiramisu and biscotti are a must try.   Sign up for emails or check the website to order breads/bagels/pretzels/etc in advance. Menu is always changing. I've been satisfied with everything I've ever eaten there. Can't really go wrong.",
