It's when they went franchise, and bicoastal is when I tried them.   I must say that they are so very tasty!! Everything I've tried have been a sports bar meal favorite!!  Each time I've had the BEST service, and have been more than satisfied with the food.  Usually I'll get one of their delicious Grilled Chicken Salads, topped with everything you can think of.  I love their signature sandwiches, and you have to get it WITH the cole-slaw. YUM, yummies!!  Not everybody likes the coleslaw, so I was very surprised to say that it is GREAT!  Fit's perfectly for this PITTSBURGH created staple!  Anyway, go on in!! It's especially fun for Steeler, Penguin or even Pirate games!",

Primantis' is great for watching the game, drinking cold beer and eating their famous sandwiches. If you order an entree then you're missing the whole reason why Primanti Bros is famous! Order the piled high Roast Beef with tomato, fries and slaw and enjoy one of the best sandwiches you'll ever have!",

I make it back about once a year and a trip to this fine establishment is the law. Of course, the ones downtown are a little more \"YINZER\" but the suburban locations are a bit quieter, quaint and a lot less waxed paper is used. The food is still amazing though! My favorite sandwich is the cheese combination because when I started eating Primanti's they didn't have the turkey and I don't eat red meat or bacon.  I know a sandwich with french fries and cole slaws sounds weird...and I have to admit the first time I ate one I wasn't sold right away...but you'll get hooked, I promise! A must for anyone visiting the Burgh!",

If we need a quick lunch or we are meeting up people Primanti's is usually the go to location.   As you know, the best part about their sandwich is that they put the slaw and fries in the sandwich. These sandwiches are HUGE and I have a hard time finishing one. I usually get the Black Angus Top Sirloin or the The Pitts-burger.  This location has a great wait staff. They never let your drink get empty. The food comes out fast and hot. I have not been to other locations but the one in North Versailles is top notch.",

I actually prefer the Monroeville location for ambiance and service, but the North Versailles location is not bad either.  Basically, I ignore everything on the menu except for the Primanti sandwiches. These are sandwiches where the fries and coleslaw are stuffed into the sandwich. If the fries are seasoned adequately and the coleslaw is not too sour, there's nothing quite like it. It's the sandwich I look forward to on my annual Pittsburgh trips, although perhaps not so much any more since I can now visit the new Primanti location in York.",

When the waitress took the sandwich back the kitchen staff member ate it I could see him from our table . He was eating while he was cooking orders . I paid my check and waited for my sandwich to come so I could leave. When it was brought over the waitress guaranteed me that it was correct. I left and I got home 10 mins later the sandwich was wrong and it wasn't even the sandwich I ordered . I called the manager and told him and he was told while we were there and he didn't seem to care to much. Last time I visit that location .",

    "text": "I really enjoy Primanti's both roast beef and corned beef sandwich's. I also like the garlic parmesan boneless wings. The pizza is also pretty good. They are all good at any location other than North Versailles. For some reason they just can't make it happen. My bread was so stale it was literally as hard as a rock. As for the wings - they had so little sauce they were simply  tasteless greasy fried chicken bites. Our waitress was nice but brought our appetizer and food at the same time even after I requested her to hold our food order until our apps came so we could enjoy them without our food getting cold.",

    "text": "My family and I love primantis but this location the past two times we've came has been a terrible experience. The first visit our server could barely wait on us because she was throwing a birthday party for her son at the same time. We decided to look past that experience and try for a second time. This time, while sitting next to the bar, we had a clear view of the of the cooks window. The entire time there seemed to be a frustrated cook yelling and fussing at the severs. We waited about 40 mins for our wings with no complaints because we were enjoying family time. Once our food arrived, it was ICE COLD. We politely notified our sever who apologized and quickly took our food back. As we watched, the server returned the food to the cook and he sighed \"what now?!\", assuming she told him we were not happy with our cold wings, he yelled \"it's the f*cking sauce\". Then he boldly stared at us like we were in the wrong. I asked the server who the manager was because we didn't appreciate the way he was handling our order, low and behold HE WAS THE MANAGER. We could not believe the foul mouth cook was the manager. This Primanti's lost our respect and our future business.",

I split the PB Rueben with my hubby, which was excellent.  Our son had the roast beef and cheese and somehow managed to eat the whole thing! Portions were huge and the food was very tasty.  Our daughter had the chicken gyro, and she said it was really good.  Savannah, our server, did an excellent job.  Our drinks were never empty and she was a pleasure to talk to!  We would definitely visit again if in the area.",

    "text": "Primanti Bros is a staple in our house!. It is very True, you either love them or hate them.  We LOVE them.  I have even gone so far as to try to make my own at home. We have been eating Primanti's since the early 70's when the only place I knew of at the time was the strip district. Then several more popped up in all the right places. I am not as fond of the restaurant style they have now moved into, I still like the quick shop for a sandwich. The restaurant don't offer the quick service that the small sandwich shops do. It is nice to have a choice when you have kids with you.  The North Versailles is my least favorite, but it is the closest. The service is good here, but time from taking order to receiving isn't all that great. Monroeville isn't bad, either, slow service.  I still prefer the Strip District. They closed my favorite on Cherry Way, downtown, for a more of restaurant location in Market Square, just isn't the same.  The location in Oakland on campus is hard to get to when you can't find a parking space.  For the most part we have received a good sandwich, every now and then the bead was cut to small or the slaw was to over powering. For the most part it has been consistent. We have never had other restaurant foods either than the sandwiches. I have been meaning to try the pizza fest, but not as of now.   Something about the fries and slaw on the sandwich makes it for me. I like the Genoa & Cheese, The Roast Beef and the Pastrami.  Other family members have gone for the When Pigs Fly.  I do like trying the new creations for the Penguins.   One of our newest locations is Ft Lauderdale which is in another post. I am looking forward to trying the new restaurant in the Waterfront in Homestead.",

We told our server who took our chips and let our cheese sit on the table . 20 minutes later , my sandwich & my fiances wings came out - and the chips from our appetizer were no where to be seen . the waitress that brought our dinner out(not santara) then took our cheese only to reheat it and reserve it with my chips that came another 15 minutes after my main course. Filthy , rude employees , crap service and the food was hardly warm wheb it came out . GROSS .",

But the bartender Jen, who was pleasant to you when she came by, was purposely inefficient and I watched the whole bar suffer from it. We sat down and waiting a solid 8 minutes to even see a bartender behind the bar. She was waiting for food to be ready by the kitchen the whole time.  She refused to make eye contact so the possibility of someone speaking to her or asking for something was impossible until she was ready to acknowledge you. I have been in the industry and there are lots of ways to be efficient and not get swamped. Fyi the bar was not crowded. Made what was to be a quick bite feel endless, as everything needed was a wait, even our silverware. We sat with our sandwiches in front of us and she left the bar to get something else with the silverware we asked for sitting by the register. Always recommend primantis but just felt the need to express the service.",
