Highland Park residents are among the luckiest since this hidden treasure (located inside Park Place Pub) serves up one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh.   Order and pay first, then find a seat at one of the tables in Park Place Pub, or take a seat on the patio out back when the weather allows.  My burgers are always cooked to order perfectly, and I haven't had a burger on the menu that I didn't absolutely love. Most likely because these burger wizards are masters of the burger-making craft.  If you haven't given them a chance, do yourselves a favor and put a trip to Applewood Smoke on the agenda.",

Each of us ordered the Applewood signature burger with smoked gouda and apples on it. Though we all ordered a different doneness in the dimness of the restaurant it was difficult to tell if they were perfectly cooked,  but they were so juicy and delicious it almost didn't matter.   The fries were well cooked and seasoned and delicious, but if you like onion rings I definitely suggest and order of them. They were large and fresh and lightly battered with a delicious horseradish sauce.   I personally thought that the drink ordering was a little strange. At the back part of the bar where the \"restaurant\"  is you can only order a few things like Mexican Coke,  IBC root beer and other bottled drinks,  but you can order regular sodas and drinks at the bar.   I can't wait to go back and try more burgers!",

The burgers were big and juicy with the right amount of everything. They cook it to the texture that you desire, for me it was medium rare. The side of fries was equally satisfying.

My wife got the Applebutter BBQ, which was delicious. The fries that came with it were crispy and good, but nothing amazing. Personally, Five Guys' fries are better. This is where the good news stops. I got the Applewood burger, which sounded amazing with Gouda cheese, apple slices, and applewood bacon. However, while the burger itself was cooked well and had good seasoning, the rest of it overall was pretty bland tasting. I was hoping the apples would give good flavor, but it was pretty pedestrian. You really couldn't taste the cheese or apples. Again though, the BBQ burger was delish!  The restaurant is hard to find because it is part of the Park Place Pub, which you don't know until you get there. This means you have to buy your food at the counter, then if you want drinks (of any kind) you have to purchase them separately from the bar. Two purchases for one meal.   What this place has going for it in delicious burger, it lacks in presentation and atmosphere. Also, there's nothing really in the way of kids food. I got grilled cheese and mini-burgers for my kids for $8 each (seems a bit much to me).   I'll probably order from here for takeout when I'm jonesing for a craft burger locally, but that's about it.",

    "text": "I had a craving for a good burger and the reviews led me here. As others have commented, it is easy to miss but it's  because it's  located in the back of a bar. Something I didn't realize until GPS kept telling us we arrived.   You can head straight back to the counter to order and either take out or dine in. There are some really tasty burger combinations on the menu  or you can opt to create your own masterpiece. I chose the mushroom swiss and swapped the swiss for provolone.  The burger came with fries, onion rings or  sweet potato fries. I ordered the regular fries dressed with bacon and cheese sauce and it was on....  There isn't  a ton of seating but we quickly nabbed a table. If you would like to indulge in a libation or fountain drink, you can order that directly from the bar. The bar and restaurant do not share registers which is really no big deal...just a heads up.   Shortly after we sat down,  our food was served by the extremely polite waitress. One bite and it was all all stars, hearts and rainbows. I mean this was one juicy burger. I enjoy meat medium to medium rare and this was perfect.  The mushrooms were perfectly cooked and the bread was substantial and held the meat and toppings in place. Fries were perfectly salted with an adequate amount of crumbled bacon and cheese sauce. It was well worth every single calorie!!!  This place is back in the cut, it has a nice feel to it and the folks are very friendly, going out of their way to check and make sure you're  enjoying your meal. I'm looking forward to testing out some other combos from their menu.   Juicy burger seekers....check it outtttt!!!",

    "text": "I was back from vacation less than 24 hours and looking for somewhere to grab a bite to eat.  Since I had just returned home, I had nothing to really eat and the thought of cooking was exhausting.  I looked through my Yelp bookmarks and Applewood Smoke Burger Company caught my eye.  A burger sounded really good.  I checked out the menu and thought, \"man, some wings would go really good with a burger\" but I didn't see them on the menu online.  Thanks to my fellow Yelpers I quickly discovered that yes, they do in fact have wings.  Sold!  I have to thank my fellow Yelpers again for letting me know that Applewood Smoke Burger Company is not a storefront but is a food counter in the back of Park Place Pub.  After I parked and walked up to Park Place Pub, I could see the burger menu posted in the window.  It's easy to miss if you're not looking for it.  I made my way to the counter and placed my order to go.  I started with some wings (Sweet Chipotle Dust).  I had been eyeing up the Bleu Fries (fries with bacon and bleu cheese) but didn't necessarily want a full order.  So I ordered up a BYOBurger and asked if I could upgrade my side of fries to the Bleu Fries - this was not a problem.  I kept my burger order simple with cheddar cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, mayo and ketchup.  They had a few other orders ahead of mine but the Penguins playoff game was about to start so I had no problem waiting at the bar with a beer while I waited for my to-go order.  The service was helpful and friendly (and patient as I couldn't make up my mind on my burger choice).  The girl who took my order said she would bring out my order to me when it was ready.  I think I was still out of there within 15 minutes and my entire order was under $20.  Even the Park Place Pub bartender was friendly and nice.   That could have been the longest 20 minute drive home ever.  I put the food in my trunk hoping I wouldn't be tortured with the smell.  That didn't work so well.  When I finally arrived home, I tore into those wings something fierce.  That Sweet Chipotle Dust (a dry rub) had the perfect amount of sweet and heat for me (i.e. not too much of either but the right amount of both).  The side of Bleu Fries was just the right size (and covered with a surprising about of cheese and bacon).  And that burger...well, let's just say it probably didn't really need anything on it.  The bun was toasted and the burger was cooked a nice medium as ordered.  I may have chewed it, I may have swallowed it whole.  I don't really remember because after that first bite I was on a cloud in burger heaven.  I think it's safe to say I'll be back another time to eat in and catch another game.  Park Place Pub is a very welcoming place and a nice home for Applewood Smoke Burger Company.",

    "text": "Agreeing with Ryann J below. Absolutely a hidden gem!   I had been skeptical of trying this place because it's in the back of Park Place Pub, which always seems empty. It's the kind of bar where you walk in and get stared at because you're not one of the few people who go there all the time. We tried for burgers one weekend when they were closed and then finally lucked out recently. We call in our order when we get burgers here and take them home to eat. They take about 15-20 minutes to cook and come well packaged in styrofoam containers with little holes to vent out steam so the bun and fires don't get soggy. When the weather is nice, maybe we'll eat on the Park Place Pub deck, since I love eating outside.  My boyfriend got the farmhouse burger and I got the bayou burger. We both ordered them medium and they were cooked perfectly, and super juicy. The farmhouse egg was dripping everywhere and looked delicious. The bayou was really well spiced, but not super spicy, so you could definitely still focus on the burger and other flavors. The buns were great too.  Their fries are pretty good, especially the bacon cheese fries (since our order was to go, they actually kept the cheese and bacon separate for us so nothing would get too soggy...so thoughtful!), but I love their onion rings. They are huge and come with a delicious horseradish dipping sauce. I grew up making onion rings with horseradish dip so the sauce is perfect for me, and is exactly what should be served with all onion rings.  I'd really recommend this place. I was pleasantly surprised when I tried it and have been there twice. I sometimes forget about it since it's not a typical restaurant but their burgers are seriously amazing and as much as I love the custom burgers at Burgatory, I think I'd choose here for the best burger in Pittsburgh.",

Of course we also had to try the fries and the onion rings! We were not disappointed, it was an awesome meal! We usually don't eat this heavy on most days but it was sure worth the cheat!!! Thank you!",

    "text": "I sooo love getting to cross Yelp bookmarked places off my list and I love even more when Yelp points me in the right direction!!  I don't get burgers ever, but I was totally craving one a couple Sunday's ago and I am happy we decided to try this place.  As other reviewers mentioned, it's hidden in the back of Park Place Pub and you go up to a counter in the back of the establishment to order food.  There are a few tables along the wall, but we decided to sit at the bar to eat.  When we walked in, there was a woman sitting at the end of the bar that I assumed was the bartender, but when I smiled at her she just looked at me blankly so then I thought maybe she was just a patron having a drink.  Once we sat down to wait for our food, said woman did come over and mix our drinks.  She was attentive but not warm and fuzzy. That's fine. We were unbothered and were sipping on our very reasonably priced drinks.  Our food came out about 20 minutes later and was delivered to us by the really sweet girl that took our food order.  The burgers looked AMAZING!!!  They do offer quite a large variety of burgers and other bar foods - wings, chicken sandwiches and salads plus a couple different kind of fries and sides to add to the order.  I went with the burger that had a fried egg and bacon on it with sweet potato fries and Bobby ordered the bison burger with the Cajun fries.  I am no burger connoisseur, but this burger was so juicy, perfectly cooked and had an amazing texture.  I will say it could use a little seasoning in the meat, but the sides and the chewy bun made up for it for me.  Bobby said his was really good, but not the best he's ever had.  My sweet potatoes were quite overdone, but I ate them anyway and the Cajun fries were perfect.  We stayed for a few more drinks and decided we would definitely be back to grab a bite and hang out and watch a game.  Cute little neighborhood place!",

    "text": "What a hidden gem! The place may look like any old dingy bar on the outside but SWEETJESUS the burgers are so delicious. Literally you should come just for the burgers.  I've been to ASBC twice and I got the Applewood burger both times. I love the combination of the sweet (the apples and the maple sauce) with the savory (the beef, bacon, bun, etc.) and all the ingredients are deployed beautifully.  While I think ASBC has some of the best burgers in Pittsburgh, everything else about the restaurant is ok. The fries are pretty decent but not nearly as good as the burger and their menu is a little on the pricey side. ASBC is also located in the Park Place Pub which is a small, laid-back bar with a fairly limited beer list.  But this place is actually burger heaven. If I lived in Highland Park, my bank account would be virtually non-existent because I would eat at Applewood literally all the time.",

Or you can eat in the bar if you want.   I've been two times now, and both times I was very pleased. These burgers meet all three of my burger criteria: 1) perfectly cooked to order - just a little pink for me; 2) massive - totally worth sharing them; 3) toppings, toppings, toppings - gouda?! caramelized or fried onions?! You're speaking my language, ASBC.  The first time I went, my husband and I split the farmhouse burger with regular fries. I personally wasn't a fan of the regular fries. Second time, we shared the BBQ burger with sweet potato fries. The BBQ burger was prefect and those sweet potato fries are killer. Those SP fries are 100%. Gonna get them every time.  And the staff are super nice, which is just icing on the cake.",

    "text": "Saw this place on the rise in the top ranked places for food in Pittsburgh so I came here to give it a try. When I arrived, I was a bit confused as to where the place was. For those who've never been here before, the joint is located in the back of a pub called Park Place Pub. You go into the pub and the joint is located in the back. Now, onto the menu. The joint sells specialty burgers (there are also a few on the chalkboard in the place not listed on the joint's official menu), build-your-own, sides (fries, potato fries, onion rings, etc.), chicken sandwiches, salads, desserts, drinks, and veggie options. I ended up going with the Bison Burger along with its included side of fries and added an order of onion rings to go. The burger itself? Fantastic. I could tell that I was chomping into a great quality patty the minute my mouth met the insides of the patty. It was not only juicy, but full of flavor and just a great tasting patty on par with Burgatory and BRGR if not better. Fries here were also great, crisp and freshly made. The onion rings were good as well, especially that horseradish sauce that really made the onion rings stand out as a side on its own. In general, great burger joint definitely worth checking out. I'll have to try some of the other choices on a future visit.",

You order your food all the way at the back, then sit and order drinks in the pub. Kind of nice if you're looking to have some alcohol with your meal.  I'll definitely be going back and recommending this to friends and family. Great, affordable burgers in a small-town pub.",

    "text": "Big burgers in a somewhat grungy pub environment. I had high hopes given the stellar reviews but this place is not special. The burgers are huge, yes, but otherwise pretty middle of the road. I got the farmhouse burger which came with a fried egg on top. The yolk immediately broke and I spent the entire meal with my hands covered in egg yolk. It had bacon which is always fantastic. There would have been no way to eat this without a mess because it was too big to bite through. My fiance got the Buffalo burger which had a great flavor but didn't come with much on it (just a little garlic aioli). Not quite as big. The fry portions seem a bit small for this kind of place. A burger and fries comes all on one smallish tray. I was expecting a bit more of a mountain. We split normal fries and Parmesan garlic fries which had so so so much oil on them - buyer beware!  Ambience: You order at a counter located in the back of Park Place Pub in Highland Park. The tables are pretty bare and some of the chairs are damaged, so this is a very no frills place. Prices are about what you'd expect ($12-14 per burger). Service is friendly and I have heard it's quick but on the Friday I went our food took 25 minutes. We think they may have run out of fries.",

    "text": "We visited Applewood Smoke Burger in early summer to satisfy a burger craving. We relied on Yelp to help us find it - it's a small counter in the back of Park Place Pub. You can sit in Park Place and eat, or you can go out back to the patio if it's a nice day. We ordered drinks (including fountain drinks) from the bar and opted for outdoor seating.   They brought us the food out back which was nice and unexpected for a walk-up ordering situation. It took a little longer than expected for the food to come out (and I mean very little - we waited 20 minutes for the wings and maybe another 20 for the burgers), but maybe my expectation was skewed because it wasn't a traditional sit-down place.   The food was worth the wait, though. We ate every single thing we ordered - no leftovers! The Apple Butter BBQ sauce on the wings was so delicious, we even dipped our fries in the leftover sauce. The burgers were cooked perfectly and had such great flavor. The namesake Applewood burger lived up to the hype.  It was a bit expensive for a burger joint, so it won't be a place we frequent regularly. But when we are craving burgers and want to hang out outside, Applewood Smoke Burger is at the top of our list.",

We walked to the back to order. The waitress was friendly and gave us some recommendations. I ordered the farm house burger and my husband ordered the stacker(?) and added grilled mushrooms. We also ordered the buffalo garlic wings to start.  For no one being there (the girl at the bar was actually the bar tender and the couple eating had left shortly after we ordered) the service was molasses. Once the wings came out, they were pretty tasty. The burgers came out as we were finishing the wings. The burger and fries looked good, but something was off. I didn't really like the bun (hubby did), the egg was greasy, the bacon was pretty limp, and the burger over all was bland. The French fries were just ok. I've had worse, but I've also had better. The place over all smelled like old fryer grease which was also a big turn off.  2 stars? Yeah, the wings were decent, but the service was slow, the bar tender was inattentive, place had a greasy smell, and the burger just wasn't good.",

    "text": "Literally as good as it gets! So thankful that I tried this place, it just took over the top spot on my Best Pittsburgh Burger list. Seriously, perfection.   It was a little hard to find. Not marked well. Park Place Pub is the right spot, don't get deterred by the lack of signage. It's located in the back of the bar. It's a separate business in the same room and you're welcome to grab drinks from the bar, which makes it even better. A nice cold draft beer and delicious burger. Does it get any better? Super casual vibes, two big TVs at each end of the bar, and a really great local hangout feel.  I had the Bison Burger... (because there is no better burger than a bison burger) and sweet potato fries. My entire group loved their meal and we ALL plan on returning soon. They also had wings, vegetarian options, salads, and side options. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Go. Just go. Got the bayou chicken sandwich. Nice spice, banana peppers, pepper jack cheese and nice fresh Bun. The others ordered burgers and the burgers were actually cooked as requested. Fries were fresh and salty. Sunday at 2 pm even during a Penguins game, it wasn't crowded. $3.50 good special beer on tAp during game. Outdoor seating for good weather. Ask for Ketchup packets if you're \"to go\"- learned the hard way. Despite all the reviews of people being confused on how to find this place, it's ashame no signage has been updated/provided. A \"burgers here\" on a street with minimal eats may do wonders.",

    "text": "Man what a burger!  So, my daughter's birthday day was coming up and I knew how much she loves burgers so I decided to give Applewood a try as we hadn't been before. Parking can be difficult as there are quite a few famous places in the same block so scoring a close parking space may be tough.   Upon arriving we were a little confused as there is no signage for Applewood Smoke Burger Company just Park Place Pub. The burger section is in the back of the pub. They offer specialty burgers, build your own burgers, chicken sandwiches, a vegetarian sandwich, salads, wraps, fresh cut fries, Cajun fries, Bleu fries (crumbled bacon and Bleu cheese), Sweet potato fries and onion rings.  After we made our orders I couldn't help but look at a order of Cajun Dust wings that a guy sitting by us was inhaling. They smelled so good I ordered a dozen for us to try. Let me just say that the wings were EPIC! I usually don't care for dry rub wings but, these were outstanding! The chicken was hot and juicy and the dry rub went perfect with the favor of the wing. They were both in perfect harmony.  The birthday girl and I both choose the Blues Burger. I got mine with Cajun fries and she got hers with cheese fries. It featured blue cheese, Applewood smoked bacon, lettuce, tomato and mayo. It was one of the top 5 best burgers I have ever had in my life! The beef patty was perfectly cooked just like I requested and the smoked bacon was just as good. The fresh Bleu cheese was the perfect complement to the burger and even went well with the wings. My meal was absolutely perfect in every way. Our daughter was more than pleased with her meal as well.  The wife got a Bayou Burger with onion rings. It features grilled onions, blackened tomato, banana peppers, Pepper Jack cheese and Chipotle mayo. She loved her burger and onion rings as well.  Applewood Smoke Burger Company is a hidden gem that more than justifies the search to find it and boy am I glad that I did!",

I got the veggie sandwich and hubby got the chicken club. Delicious all around! Will return if we're in the area again! Next time I'll try the vegan wings!",

Lots of great choices and the burgers are fantastic! You can enjoy your food in the bar, so have a cold beer with your burger! The place is nothing fancy, but the food is great. A great stop for lunch, so pair it up with another fun activity for a great day with friends.",
