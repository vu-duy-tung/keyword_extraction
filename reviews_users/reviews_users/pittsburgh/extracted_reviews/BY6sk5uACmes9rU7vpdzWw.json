    "text": "The food at Joe's Rusty nail is GREAT. As the pictures will show, the servings/portions are plentiful. The service is quick, and the staff personable. I went there for breakfast AND everyone in our group left sated!! As always I had my kid carnivores in tow, and as is their custom they laid waste to EVERYTHING edible that was put before them. While they are a TAD (and I do mean tad)  bit pricey I believe that the food is more than worth it. The clientele (what I can only believe are Bellevue regulars) are polite and inviting. My breakfast was made well, tasted great, and dressed pretty as a picture. I will tell you this is not my first rusty nail rodeo and lord willing it will not be my last. As I say I vote with my feet and my USD, and the staff at rusty nail can sleep well tonight knowing that my hard earned cash, will continue to flow at Joe's and my feet will continue to bring me there hopefully more often than not!!",

Breakfast has always been good with large portions.  My boyfriend and I usually end up splitting something and getting an extra order of cheesy potato puffs (which are amazing).  Eggs Benedict is usually my breakfast out choice but I wasn't crazy over the cheese sauce.  Everything else I've had here has been delicious though.  The staff is always pleasant and quick.

I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!",

The place is on the main street, Lincoln Ave (or up street as my family called it).  They were quite busy on a Saturday morning but we only waited about 5-10 minutes for a table.  I enjoyed a sausage omelet with American cheese and my husband had a Denver omelet.  The omelets were well prepared and served with toast.  Potatoes were and extra $2.29, but a serving of potatoes was enough for two.  Breakfast for four adults was about $50 including tip.  All adults had coffee or tea and a full breakfast.  The service was friendly and prompt on the day we were there and coffee refills were offered readily.  It is cramped quarters, but typical for neighborhood non-diner breakfast joints in urban areas.  We had a great diner breakfast in homey surroundings.  We will definitely go back when visiting Pittsburgh.",

When I picked up the sandwich grease poured from it. I'm not one to send back food, and that's my fault, but the waitress came by once as I was eating, over heard me upset about my food, looked at me then continued on her way. Needless to say I don't think I will be returning.",

That said, two stars is all I can muster primarily due to the tiny, cramped dining area.  I've witness people at three tables being disrupted while they are eating so departing diners would have enough room to push their chair away from the table and pass by others just to leave.  Don't get me wrong, I adore that Pittsburgh is a small, friendly city, but I'm not fond of getting elbowed in the back as the guy behind me cuts his breakfast steak and eggs, nor knowing his guest gargled with Cool Mint Listerine this morning (or worse, didn't) .  Yes, the tables are packed THAT close together.  And whatever you do, don't dare bring a large friend here to dine when it's busy unless you enjoy feeling like a complete 'jag off' for doing so on the way out.",

If you're looking for a cheap, low key, dependable place to go, come home at 8 o'clock one evening, sit in the window, and especially around the holiday season, I assure you that it will be one of the best \"old time\" meals you'll ever have.

It was just nothing special pretty typical greasy diner food. While there we couldn't help but notice all the articles and awards on the wall stating this was one of Pittsburgh's best breakfast spots. So, sometime later, on a hungover morning after a wedding some of my boyfriends friends were staying with me and wanted to get some breakfast and I thought let's check out that rusty nail again. What a great decision. I think we all got one of the specials and they were all delicious. Mine came with some kind of homemade hash brown patties that were amazing. The only downside is they only take cash (that's not uncommon around here) but they have an atm. Also there is often a wait on the weekends but for us it wasn't very long and they have free coffee outside for you while you wait. Well ok one more thing the actual restaurant is very small and kinda lop-sided but hey I'd rather have a cheap delicious breakfast in a shitty place than pay more for a nicer atmosphere.",

And the food was.... just so bland!  I get that it was supposed to be homestyle cooking, but it just had no flavor.  To be fair, we did go for dinner, and I understand that this place is more of a breakfast joint, so I would be willing to try it again sometime for breakfast.

The penne was overcooked and the sauce the penne was sauteed in along with some spinach was greasy and lacked flavor.  They made an attempt to hide it with parmesan cheese.  The fillet was not... just random chunks of fatty beef with no flavoring.  They were not marinated, not uniformly cut nor trimmed.   Sad when the bread and butter is the best part of your meal.",

    "text": "Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources, I'm sad to say I was sorely disappointed.   They have a wide selection of breakfast options.  However, even with numerous breakfast specials listed, not one included eggs, meat, potatoes AND toast.  Yes, that's right.  I had to order the eggs, bacon and toast special with a side of the potatoes.  When my food was served, the portions were average except for the side order of potatoes.  I did greatly enjoy the potatoes, though, which I ordered deep fried.  My dining companion ordered the French toast with ham and enjoyed it very much.    We were here on a weekday morning so we didn't have to worry about it being crowded.  The service was good.  And it's not that I thought anything was bad, it's just that, as the two star rating says, \"Meh, I've experienced better.\"  Given the plethora of choices in Bellevue, this will not be my first stop should I find myself on Lincoln Avenue for breakfast again.",

We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.  For my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom, spinach and feta junior omelet.  Her omelet is self explanatory while mine had in it some salami, cheese and three pieces of sliced pepperoni on top of it.  It was readily apparent that the pepperoni was not the cheap kind that you get on most pizzas as it had more flavoring and tasted much better.  Both omelets came with sides of home fries and toast for which we both ordered deli rye.  The junior omelet tasted good as the sourness of the feta played nicely with earthy mushrooms while the spinach made it feel like I was eating healthy.  My omelet was just as good if not better than the junior omelet as the cheese and meats combined to make it seem like I was almost eating a pizza.  Some of my hash browns were slightly overcooked and they had too many onions for my taste but we still decent enough to be a side to the main show.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  Everything that I tasted was good and I would not hesitate to take any of my friends here for a breakfast.",

The food was AMAZING. the eggs were cooked perfectly, and not super greasy like a lot of places. The French toast was one of the best I ever had. The plates were set up so nicely.

So it's not your typical diner atmosphere, and every once in a while you're elbows will get bumped by a server trying to pass. But it really isn't that much of a deterrent, as the breakfast itself was delicious. I ordered a broccoli and cheese omelet, and for no charge I was able to add an extra egg. Who said nothing in life is free? The broccoli was actually seasoned and fresh, and the Russian rye toast was different then standard rye and tasted like pumpernickel. My wife's poached eggs were done perfectly and the staff was friendly and fast. Highly recommended for anyone looking for a cheap, good breakfast spot in Bellevue.",

They offer up big portions and I've rarely finished a meal here. Just so happens they focus on omelettes and pancakes, two things I rarely order for breakfast. The pancakes are big, semi-dense and have a nice flavor. Eggs cooked to order are very large and delicious. The potatoes and onions are good, but require hot sauce for flavor in my opinion.  Major downfall is the coffee, I'm sure it's Folger's or something comparable, not very drinkable unfortunately.  Waitstaff is typically pleasant and the prices are affordable. Worthwhile spot to visit if you want to avoid the chains in the area. Cash only.",

The only thing I didn't care for was the cold breeze when someone walks in the door. I asked the waitress what the most popular item is on the menu. And she said her absolute favorite was the Tuna Fish Melt. She said it so passionately that I just had to try it. I ordered that with fries.  The wait was not long, and the sandwich was pretty ok. I just wish that it had just a little bit more flavor to it. But all in all, pretty decent. The service was very pleasant, and so I will return to try out another item. And will post an updated review....for now, check it out...it's a cute little restaurant with food that taste a bit like it's from Mom's kitchen. Oh and make sure you bring cash.

They have a reasonably priced menu with the standard breakfast offerings of eggs, omelets, french toast, and pancakes with options of bacon, sausage, hash browns or homefries and a variety of breads from which to choose for toast.  I love how they have free coffee out for people who have to wait for a table, though I was surprised that there wasn't a wait when we showed up and we were seated fairly quickly.    The place is a bit crowded in that the space is smallish with a lot of seated packed in, but overall we didn't feel claustrophobic, but it is hard to make your way through the dining area, so be warned.  Service was a little shaky at first as we seemed to have 3 different employees attend to us, until we finally realized which person was our waitress, but after that everything was smooth sailing.  I ordered an bacon and cheese omelet with a side of rye toast and my boyfriend got 2 eggs over easy with a side of bacon and sausage and hashbrowns well done.  Everything was cooked to our liking and arrived in a timely manner.  Overall, we really enjoyed our experience there and look forward to going back again soon.  Word of warning - they only take cash, and do have an ATM on site, but if you want to avoid a high withdrawal fee, make sure to have cash on hand before you walk in the door.",

There's no hostess station so pick a table and sit down. Blend! We sat down next to an elderly gentleman reading the newspaper in his Steelers' Starters jacket. That's the type of brunch place this is.  Prices are very reasonable: basic breakfasts (eggs, pancakes, omlettes) weren't over $6.95 and even the specials were only $8 or $9.  I got the eggs benedict which is my go-to, however I didn't care for this version. Instead of hollandaise sauce, the dish comes with CHEESE sauce. Not my favorite that it came on a thin English muffin either, but our potatoes were good. (Two options: deep fried and pan fried with onions. We got both and thought the deep fried were best. Can you blame us?!)  Total bill for 2 came to $20. I'm looking forward to going back and trying some of their other breakfasts!",

The Rusty Nail fit the bill for exactly what I was looking for: Attentive and kind staff Home-like, comfortable diner feel Solid eggs, bacon, and potatoes Cheap  I've also been to Rusty nail for dinner, and it's still cheap prices and huge portions; however, not nearly as tasty as their breakfast. Stick to things you'd normally get at a diner, nothing that sounds too fancy, and you're sure to be satisfied!  Tip! Cash only, but there is an ATM.",

It did look good but I started off my day with a danish from the bakery across the streert.  Since we were here just a couple of days, I wanted to try the evening meal. We ended up ordering \"take out\" and got just one of the day's specials. Hard to chose among them but we got beef tips over noodles with a dark mushroom type gravy.  It was filled with meat.  A salad came with it, huge salad with tomatos that tasted like they were fresh picked.  Blue cheese dressing on the side.  Again, a huge serving where both of us had two big bowls of salad.  And then two slices of Italian bread with butter on the side.  All nicely shrink wrapped so that none of the goodness would spill.  It is a cash only place.  Another find with good, diner style cooking.  I plan to return on our next visit.",

    "text": "I'm gonna be honest with you here.  I thought this place was a bar and passed it by on multiple occasions.  I mean with a name that has 'rusty nail' in it, you kind of get a bar image.  Was I ever delighted when it turned out that I was wrong.  Looking for food after an exhausting day I was basically tired and found myself in front of here.  When I looked in the window I found a dining room with tables rather than a bar filled with people standing.  While looking in the window I also noticed daily specials.  These change from day to day.  So if you don't want something on the menu, you can choose one of the daily specials.    On this particular night we went with the specials.  I went in and asked for a menu.  I was offered a seat, but I declined since I knew I was taking it with me.  After looking of the menu quickly I went with the specials.  I ordered the stuffed pork chops for my better half and then for myself I got the stuffed chicken breast.  While it was being prepared I was once again offered a seat and a drink.  I again declined.  Once the food was prepared I was surprised by the amount that came out, it was definitely a dinner.  Just so everyone knows, cash only.  If you don't have enough cash on you, there is an ATM inside to help you.  Once I got the food home I was floored.  The amount is overwhelming and will fill you up for sure.  You get a salad with your meal as well, and bread.  Two big slices of fresh Italian bread which accompanies your meal quite nicely.  I can't speak to the pork chops, but that chicken breast was huge and filled to the brim with some amazing stuffing.  Covered in gravy which gives you a nice blend of flavors.  The mashed potatoes were equally amazing and that gravy continued there.  The broccoli was great as well.    I can tell you that I cleaned my plate that night and had a happy belly.  Definitely a place I will stop back at once again.",

They are a cash only restaurant, but they have an ATM on site.   I was meeting my parents for dinner around 6pm - I got to the restaurant first, so I went in to get a table. Maryann (our waitress) told me to pick a table, so I picked one against the wall. Unfortunately, there's not a lot of room in between the tables - but I was able to find one where our whole party was comfortable.   Each day, they have different dinner specials. They also offer a variety of foods for those young and old.   I ordered the Cream of Chicken & Wild Rice soup go start - it was so tasty! I definitely order it again.   I ordered the Chicken Stuffed Breast for dinner - it was similar to a Thanksgiving dinner. Chicken stuffed with stuffing, mashed potatoes, gravy, corn, and cranberry sauce. It was delicious!!!   For dessert, I ordered a piece of the Lemon Meringue pie - it hit the spot!   I will be back again soon!",

This is a small charming little place in Bellevue with table seating and a full menu from Salads, to Burgers to full Meals and it looks like they have some amazing Breakfast I'll be back for.  I tried one of the specials which was a Jambalaya Sandwich that should be on the main menu. Yes it was that good. A Sandwich and Potato Salad for $6.99 is a heck of a deal these days.  The service was great and I get the feeling the ladies have all been there for ages. They seemed to have great rapport with the regulars of which there were many.  This one should not be missed!",

The husband was hungry and while they don't have veggie items on the menu they made him a Texas Turkey minus the Turkey which was wholesome grilled cheese with tomatoes reminded me of moms grilled cheeses. Lovely service. Let's keep places like this going among the up and coming farm to table spots also.",

If it's one thing I absolutely despise when dining out, it's when tables are so close to each other that you have no privacy to talk to the people you're with. I just felt like I was sitting on top of everyone to the table next to me, the waitresses had to stand very close to the table so they didn't knock things over. I ordered a tuna sandwich with some fries and coleslaw. Fries were great, coleslaw was great, the tuna sandwich was absolute garbage. It was seriously awful. Wayyy to much tuna on the actual sandwich, it kept pouring out of my sandwich because it was a runny consistency, and it made the bread soggy pretty quick. The tuna itself had no flavor whatsoever, and had huge chunks of celery and onion in it. I can't believe I made it almost halfway through the sandwich without vomiting. My mother in law got a steak sub I believe, and she thought it was good. She also got a cup of their soup on special that day, which was cheeseburger pasta soup. I took a bite of her soup and it was oddly good. My boyfriend got a burger, and thought it was okay. Overall I'm not sure I'd want to dine in here again. The whole place can make anyone feel claustrophobic, and after that disaster of a tuna sandwich, I'm completely turned off.",

Mom drove down one night to have dinner with me. I was feeling healthy (hahah, short lived) so I decided to get a steak salad. But since were here in the good old 412, salads mean croutons, fries and boiled eggs. Sooo, borderline healthy. I tried.   I can't even describe to you how big this salad was. I can almost compare it to the salad they bring a family of four at the Olive Garden. Tons of fresh veggies, a good amount of steak, eggs, and a plentiful topping of fries. I got the ranch dressing and Mom got Italian. They didn't specify that their dressings are made in house, but they seemed it, even if they weren't.   Mom and I could have split one of these! But I'm glad we didn't. It was such a good salad. I love cucumbers, and fortunately, Mom doesn't, so I got to steal hers. Win!   The service was great. The server knew her menu, and made suggestions when Mom was undecided between the salad and the special.   Mental note to self: they are cash or check (what?) only.   Happy Eating.",

Service is usually pretty quick but if you go on a weekend there's a wait outside of the door. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because there isn't much for me to eat on the lunch menu, being a vegetarian. I did order Alfredo once without chicken & it was full of small pieces of uncooked garlic. I couldn't even eat much of it. Other than pasta, there weren't really any meatless options. However, they serve breakfast all day & their coffee is pretty good for being a diner. I will always come back here because the food is always consistent and the service is always good.",
