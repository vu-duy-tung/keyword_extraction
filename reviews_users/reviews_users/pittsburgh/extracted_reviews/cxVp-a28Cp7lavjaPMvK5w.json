The food, though, was mediocre. We ordered the Ki King Broccoli which was pretty good, but the entrees of Sesame Chicken and Pad Thai were very, very bland. It practically had no flavor. We asked for hot sauce (which can only do so much) but as another review said, it was like a Disney-style \"Asian\" establishment. Food was meh, but I probably won't come here again.",

I'm only giving 3 starts though, because the food was not very good. They offer small plates for sharing, which is fine. Actually the size of the plates were bigger than we expected. Our server recommended 3-4 plates per person, but we could get through half of it. We had the risotto which was undercooked and waaay too salty. The sushi rice was crunchy from either being undercooked or old- either way, disgusting. The flavors were not as described on the menu. For example, the hidden dragon sauce on the chicken was not spicy, but the sauce on the rice cakes was rather hot. I would not recommend the race cakes, btw. Not like a typical rice cake. These things were chewy and gross.   Overall, the best thing we ordered was the brussels sprouts appetizer. The drinks were good too. I'd go back to have the brussels and drinks. Maybe try some desert too since we didn't get any the first time around.",

Everything else was mediocre at best. Every vegetable in the place appeared to be fried - I didn't realize you could ruin broccoli like that. I had to send back the miso soup because it was inedible. Miso soup - that is hard to ruin.   Service was friendly, but distracted. Bar was very slow. We got our second round of drinks well after we were done eating (to their credit, however, the server comped these drinks).   This place would be great if they upped the quality of raw ingredients, had a much lighter hand on seasoning, and did some more staff training to work out the kinks.",

What you expect from an AMPD establishment  - what do you expect when you call it an izakaya....a Japanese word but serve everything from Vietnamese, Chinese, Korean, etc.  oh yeah all Asian food is the same  Ambiance (4/5) - good music, lots of people - great atmosphere  Update - Jan 13, 2017 They actually reached out and said they revamped their ramen so wanted me to revisit.  Sooo.....actually nothing was different.  Sushi wasnt bad, excellent service but ramen was actually worse now than before.  This time they overlooked the ramen, it was chopped up into pieces, and no more chashu but instead they put shredded pork in it..... overall quite disappointing.",

My husband and I shared the poke aloha specialty roll that was garnished with tuna tartar, which was a touch we both appreciated. We also shared shrimp skewers and scallop pad thai. This is definitely a place to order and share a variety of dishes. The plates we ordered were on the spicy side, so if you're not into spice be cautious. Also, when ordering a martini indicate if you want it very dry. I did not and my drink had too much vermouth for my taste. Would definitely recommend and would definitely come back.

I liked that they brought out the rolls as they were ready, as it was just 2 of us sharing everything. I could see how this would be a little odd if the table wasn't planning on all sharing, but the servers explain how it works right away. Their signature rolls were pretty tasty and they didn't disappoint with classics like the spicy tuna roll.   The only real negative was that they have a live dj and the music is LOUD. At first the two of us were seated at opposite ends of a long-ish table that would've been really awkward for sharing dishes and we would've had to yell over the music the entire meal. If I hadn't asked to switch to the empty booth behind us our dinner experience probably wouldn't have been nearly as nice.",

The idea is there, they just have to fix the delivery.  The sushi was standard. If you're downtown and just looking for sushi though, you have Penn Ave Fish further downtown and Sushi Kim closer to the Strip District.  The entrees were fine, but I'd expect more than just fine. The coconut fried rice was alright, the tofu was good, the bok choy was eh.  If their performance with Local and Steel Cactus is any indication, I suspect they'll be pretty good by late Spring.",

The food comes out based on when it is ready. I ordered the Ramen which ended up being the largest item and came out last. I felt wasteful because there was not way I could finish it and everyone else finished their food waaaayyyy before me. Other than the the food tasted good. We ordered the Brussels Sprouts, rock fish and peppers for a starter. Everyone enjoyed them and they all came out at the same time.   Salmon and rice was also good and I would recommend getting.

If you know what to order, the food is amazing and you can try a lot of different dishes for a relatively good price compared to most downtown restaurants. My go-tos are the ki king broccoli, chee chee fried brussel sprouts, and salmon robata. A lot of the robata dishes are small, but the salmon is an entree sized portion for the same price as the other, skewer-type robatas. It's a steal, and cooked perfectly! I also like their sushi, but since there are other good places in Pittsburgh that specialize more so in sushi, I would recommend trying more of Social House's unique offerings. Some other good picks are the bibimbap, bok choy, and spicy tofu. Also, do not bypass the fortune cookie for dessert if you still have room (it's one of my favorite desserts!), and ask for the Frenchman!",

The Good... * The Brussel Sprouts were AMAZING and def lived up to the hype! * The Taiwanese pork melted in your mouth and absolutely amazing! But apparently it was supposed to come with a Brussel sprout salad which was missing (and we did say anything cuz, well, I didn't remember it was supposed to be here until now). * Our waiter was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and offered helpful suggestions.  The Bad... * It took a legit 20 minutes for our dessert. And that's what we timed...meaning we had been waiting much longer than that. While the Mississippi Mud Pies were delicious, I don't understand why it took so long. * The pork bao was lacking. Granted this is the first time I've ever tried one, but it was lacking.   The Ugly... * The place smelled funky. Like, \"this stench is gonna stick on your clothes and body for at least a day\" funky. It's not the hibachi table smell...and I dunno what it is, but it's funky. In a BAD way. Like a really bad way.  While I'd like to try more of the menu since some parts of our meal were amazing (and we admittedly didn't order much), I don't know if I will due to the stench. Caution: Don't go there in dry clean only clothes cuz you're gonna STANK!",

The sea bass was a great cut, was cooked perfectly, and was served on top of a creamy crab risotto- highly recommended!

Really cool.  The restaurant decor was pretty nice too with carved wood walls and pop art ceiling.  We ordered the sushi and sashimi sample platters and the crispy rock shrimp.  The fish were fresh and tasted perfect. The rock shrimp was good too and the gochujang aioli paired well with it.  But maybe it was too much for the two of us because we came to a point where the oil in the shrimp dampened our appetite (just like when you eat greasy food).",

    "text": "Let me preface this review by saying I had come here months ago for sushi only--I thought everything was rather meh, but wanted to come back and try their other food in hopes that it was better.   I was wrong. I ordered the pad thai which was recommended by our server, and it was awful. Two others in our group ordered it as well and weren't happy with it. It was spicy--which I didn't mind but others did--and had literally NO other flavors. Just spicy bland noodles. It tasted like something I would expect to get from a frozen Panda Express entree.   My husband ordered a lo mein entree. This had more flavor but was so salty, anyone with high blood pressure should stay clear. Again, this tasted like something I'd heat up in my microwave.  ...but...but....there's a GIANT (Buddha? Kali? Forgive my ignorance) statue!   ....there's koi IN THE FLOOR!  .....I can park my super expensive car outside and EVERYONE WILL SEE IT!!!  So if the \"coolness\" factor is all that's important to you, and you don't mind eating what is essentially an overpriced, microwave-quality meal, then I recommend this place.",

The broth was SUPER salty. Don't recommend that. BUT dumpling were tasty. And my gf got sushi. It was good. Not great. It's sushi. Kinda hard to mess up if you do sushi. But hard to do amazing. These were okay and normal. Not a cheap place so keep that in mind. This was date night out so we wanted to try a new place. More like a club with sushi and bar. But the staff was great to us considering we probably didn't look the part. FYI",

    "text": "My friend lives very close to Social House Seven, so when I decided to visit her for lunch, I ordered takeout of their chee chee brussel sprouts and bi bim bap online. When I arrived, no one made eye contact with me for at least 4 minutes, despite there only being 3 other customers in the restaurant, seated at the bar. I think a \"we'll be with you in just a second\" goes a long way toward establishing some hospitality. My order wasn't quite ready, and then they almost let me walk off without paying for it.  When I finally did get to sit down and dig in, I found the brussel sprouts really flavorful, but very, very greasy. I don't usually feel guilty about eating brussel sprouts, but this basically felt like eating a cabbage-y pizza...in a (mostly) good way. I think some of that might have been because it was takeout and spent some time steaming/wilting in the plastic container.   The bi bim bap, however, was incredibly disappointing. The meat was tough and it tasted like it was brined in pure vinegar. The veggies were bland and underwhelming. The bowl was 70% unseasoned rice, and I ended up throwing most of it out because it wasn't worth the energy of carrying it back to the office.   I'd consider visiting again if I could stay and appreciate the ambiance of the restaurant, but I definitely would not order takeout again. I'm not usually the kind of person who complains about her food, but if that bi bim bap had arrived at my table, I would have sent it back to the kitchen.  I shared a little with my friend and she described my bi bim bap as \"utter garbage.\" I could not agree more.  Overall, it was a $22 lunch that was mediocre at best.",

Honestly I wish I would have had a properly cooked meal like the menu shows. It's like the idiot kitchen staff didn't care because they knew it wouldn't be coming back. The head chef should be fired for letting food like that out the door. Take pride in your food!  Two thumbs AND two big toes down. Now to scrounge up some crackers or cheese or something.....",

I saw the progress of this restaurant when they were building it and I've wanted to check them out since they opened.  I'm glad we stopped by.         We sat at the bar which was by an open area where you're practically sitting outside.  This is within walking distance from the Clemente Bridge so it's a great place to stop at before and after a baseball game in the summer months.         My wife and I enjoyed the atmosphere a lot.  When we come back we will always sit by the open garage door in the warmer months.  The drinks were expensive but that's expected downtown.  We got to look at the menu and it looks like they have a good menu to try out the next time that we stop by.       It wasn't busy so it was surprising that our bartender was preoccupied in other parts of the restaurant.  She was good when she was here but she was busy doing other things when we needed her.  Hopefully it's not like this when they are busy.      The rest of the restaurant looks nice too but you can't beat sitting by the street absorbing the Pittsburgh energy.  Were looking forward to tying their food menu one day soon and getting a few drinks before a Buccos game in the near future.  Stop by and try out this nice new addition to the Burgh!",

Service was also really great, with our friendly server offering food and drink pairing suggestions while never once complaining one bit about splitting the check amongst 7 people.  Food was maybe a 3/5. I wasn't impressed by any of the dishes' presentation, portion sizes, or flavors.  I ordered the Godzilla roll which was fairly large but not big enough to warrant the $17 price tag. Drinks seemed to be on the more expensive side as well, but that could be because we had a large group and split the alcohol tab.   Past 11 pm, a smaller portion of the restaurant turns into a bar/dance floor. Not sure if the kitchen closes at that time but the full bar should keep you well stocked for the night.",

There's a giant Shiva sculpture in the corner which makes little sense, and they seem to have tried hard to make their menu sound impressive. I wasn't terribly hungry when I came, so I decided on sushi. There was only one vegetarian option. In mostl places there are either avocado, cucumber, or asparagus rolls. Here they put all three vegetables into one roll and added tomatoes on top. It was kinda weird to be honest! If they wanted to be edgy they should have served up the roll with japanese pickles inside. The table ordered broccoli and brussel sprout apps which saved this place. They were tasty and were large portions. However, I would say it's a hit or miss with sizes. Some things are literally tiny..two pieces! I don't see a reason to come back.",

We really enjoyed the variety on the menu and the drink choices.  We ordered a few things from the Appetizers and then we split Short Rib Yaki Noodle AND the Spicy Tofu.  We thought the both dishes were delicious. Spices/flavors were perfect.  I live in a tourist destination where prices are always inflated, so these prices I felt were VERY REASONABLE. This is a great menu for sharing plates.  When I return to Pittsburgh, I'll be sure to return here. :)",

Each time I have returned I thought the quality of the food has gone downhill and the portions have gotten smaller. For example the robata scallops the first time I got it, I got 6, tonight I got 4. The chicken with the hidden dragon sauce, nowhere near as good. This is a classic example of the AMPD group. They start out strong but slowly go down the drain. Steel cactus is another example, started out amazing, now both locations are sub par. AMPD makes their money and then just doesn't care. If you want Asian cuisine, stick to your jimmy wans or your little tokoyos of pittsburgh. One thing I will say, the ambiance is great there. If I could rate it a 2.5 I would but I rounded up.",

Originally went to proper brick oven and tap room, but after hearing that the wait was 1 hr 15 minutes, hightailed it out of there. Social House Seven was right next door and very close walking distance to the Benedum. We were told that the wait for a table would be 2 hrs but that we could get full service at the bar. There is one larger bar to the left and a smaller bar with about 8-10 seats to the right when you walk in. There was plenty of room at the smaller bar and we snagged two seats and were promptly given menus. The bartender explained that the food  comes out as it is ready, and she wasn't joking. Our first sushi roll came out approximately 5-10 minutes after ordering it. We ordered the wok charred rice cakes, scallop pad Thai, snow crab Cali roll, crunchy spicy tuna roll, and the chicken tempura roll. Everything was amazing. Great sushi, and the rice cakes were so different and delicious, almost like \"Asian gnocchi\" with a proportionate amount of crisp and chew. Portions were pretty good. Pad Thai was very flavorful, slightly sweet and with lime zest throughout, which was unique. Cool decor and vibe, good service. We were finished with our meal and out the door in plenty of time to make our show. Reservations can be made on Open Table. Will definitely be back!",

Decided to check this spot out on one of my visits to Pittsburgh. The atmosphere is awesome, decor is amazing, and service was above par. Our server Ryan was so attentive and friendly and had many great recommendations. (-1 for it being too packed on a Friday evening when we were there, but hey, that could be a positive thing too right?)",

The brussels sprouts appetizer was really good- presented with bonito flakes on it so it looks like it is alive.  It is SUPER heavy, though, even shared I felt like I ate an anvil.  I ordered the sea bass with pumpkin noodle curry and it was overall gross.   The $24 dish had a 3oz. piece of sea bass, prepared properly, but the pumpkin noodle curry was just awful. Mushy, tasteless, but I tried to choke it down because it was so expensive.  I got through about a 1/3 of it before I could not stomach any more.  It may have been missing something as simple as salt, but that dish was just screaming for flavor and some sort of crunch.  The ice cream is house made, was really good. I got mint chip, mint as in mint from your garden.  Different, but the best part of the meal.",

I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of the food, although we only had sushi.  We sat at the bar and enjoyed very large pours of wine which I am definitely not complaining about! The service was just OK, had to constantly ask for different things and was not approached by the bartendar at all to check on us, our food was spilled by the server twice upon delivery, mistakes happen I get it.  The Poke & Spider roll were delicious.  The place was surprisingly empty for a saturday night at 8 oclock but it is also HUGE inside.  I would return.",

To begin, our waitress hadn't introduced herself properly, the timing of the food was completely absurd. An hour for 2 appetizers! The manager ensured us he would check on our food and never returned. I'm sure most of the kinks will get resolved as the restaurant gains it's footing, but the moderate level of anticipation did not match the outcome whatsoever. I was sorely dissatisfied with the food and even more disappointed with the service.",

Our server was nice but seemed very busy. They did mention that the food would be brought out as it was ready, which was ok for us since we were doing family style. The sushi was great. The Brussels sprouts were also great. The bok choy, rice cakes, shrimp skewers, monk fish all has the same char flavor, which I normally would would like, but just not on several dishes. The shrimp was overdone. The social house chicken was very unimpressive. The pad Thai was the worst I ever had. It was very bland. The edamame hummus was just ok. I think the flavor was lacking in these dishes. Only my appetizer dish was cleared along with my utensils and chop sticks. but the rest of the 5 people had their dirty dishes left in front of them. I then had to ask for another dish and more utensils. We took a friend there for her birthday and all 6 of us were underwhelmed. The noise / acoustic level was a little louder than I would have liked. We are generous tippers and usually order several drinks, but we didn't feel that we were able to get drinks fast enough.

The Robata section of the menu was not available, and they had no lettuce for their lettuce wraps. The edamame hummus plate was beyond disappointing, and the pad thai with chicken was very dry and tasteless. My dinner came out fairly quickly but all of the others in my party had to wait an extended period of time for their meals. We were given the excuse that all food is served family style and is brought to the table when it is ready. In my opinion, that just means they are not organized enough to present the food for each table in a timely manner. We wanted to eat together, but instead we had two separate meals. I hope they can turn things around, because it is a beautiful restaurant in a great location.",

The food, however, is sub-par, and it is certainly not worth the amount of money that you pay for it. One thing that I cannot emphasize enough is: DO NOT COME HERE FOR AUTHENTIC SUSHI. This was the furthest from authentic I have ever seen. (My first clue probably should have been that many of the sushi rolls contained asparagus as an ingredient.) The sushi pieces were very large and had no physical integrity whatsoever. We were provided with chopsticks, which were useless with sushi rolls that immediately disintegrate, and a little container for soy sauce, which was also useless, as the sushi was too big and too fragile to dip inside. The sushi rice was also warm, which is something that I have never experienced before, and I'm pretty sure is not right. Even the appetizers we ordered were disappointing. A pretty presentation and fancy plate does not make up for average, fairly bland food. It was simply not worth the money. Again, if you want something even remotely authentic, this is not the place.",

They said they could give us one but that we would have to leave by 8:00 since there were reservations for those tables then so we opted to sit at the sushi bar instead. There were three of us and we were sharing dishes so sitting three across at a sushi bar was a little awkward, but the food was very good.

My girlfriend and I shared the dumplings and brussel sprouts to start. Both were delicious. The sprouts were a surprisingly large portion for a restaurant that is more akin to a tapas style restaurant. We then each had a sushi roll and were both satisfied.  Finally, the cocktails were also great. I had the sangria and the gin and she had the mule and a martini.   The one complaint, albeit a large one, was the staff seemed extremely disorganized. It wasn't just the small stuff, it was common sense. For example, it was just me and her and at first we were seated at a large table for six. I had to ask to be moved to a smaller booth.   Everyone just seemed frazzled. It can likely be attributed to it being a new restaurant. I will be back, but it will be at least a few weeks to let the staff get it together.",

    "text": "I usually just peruse Yelp but this place deserves a review. Great new spot for Pittsburgh. It was pretty busy on a Saturday night but not overflowing. We were able to sit at the bar no problem  Awesome decor- super cool fish tank as you walk in (look down!) and overall well decorated restaurant throughout. Two bar areas plus a sushi bar. There are booths which looked cool and seem to allow for some privacy   Rebecca served us at the bar and was extremely attentive and knowledgeable. A+ !!  Brussel sprout appetizer is amazing- must try!!! Steamed dumplings were VERY good as well and come with a uniquely delicious dipping sauce  My friend got risotto and raved about it. It is served with a mound of miso butter that is folded in tableside (barside in this case).   Dragon chicken was good too and super white tuna was very fresh, melt in your mouth sashimi.   Got a spicy tuna roll too- we were full but this was a let down, worth skipping next time  The menu is HUGE, which makes for a good excuse to come back soon.",

    "text": "We arrived after 7 pm so the place was noisy and busy - to be expected.  We were seated right away and the menu was given to us right away.  The choices might have been great for someone who was familiar with Japanese cuisine but to those of us who are not, it was a bit bewildering. However, I did order the spicy egg rolls and a glass of wine.  My husband ordered the salmon sushi roll and sake.  He was disappointed that the salmon was not a piece of salmon but more like salmon which had been ground up, like hamburger. My rolls have a good flavor but were very chewy.  When we left and the waiter brought back the bill w/card for us to sign he just 'flew' by us and threw the bill holder at the table.  It promptly fell on the floor, dumping the contents and the waiter just kept on going.  Needless to say this was very disconcerting and if I have been in charge of signing the bill, no tip would have been given.  Especially since we really did not have much 'wait service' from the staff. Since we don't live in Pittsburgh we will never visit this place again and if we did live here we would not visit this place again nor would we recommend it to our friends.",

My biggest complaint is I asked for a side of white steamed rice. It came out in small cup size bowl. I didn't see it on the menu either. Now for the kicker, it was $5.00 for the side of rice. More than half of what the full lunch entree was. The entree was ok, chicken was very dry. Not sure if I will return.",

    "text": "I came to Pittsburgh for a business trip and they took us here. The ambiance is fun and hip. Dark decor, very nicely decorated.   I should've titled this review, SALTY! OMG, the food is sooo salty. They add so much salt because the food has no taste. The appetizers we ordered were okay. We got: brussel sprouts, chicken lettuce wraps, tuna tartare, and the rockin' shrimp. They were all pretty good and you get a nice sized portion. We also got the pork belly. Now I know pork belly is salt but this pork belly was SALTY!!! I ate one piece and gave the other to a friend. I just couldn't eat it. The sushi was bland. We got the volcano, which was the best tasting one but still bland compared sushi I've had at other places. The spider didn't have any other taste but salt. Didn't care for it. I tried someone's noodle salad. It was pretty good.   The drinks were pretty good. I got the punch of the day. It had sake in it but it was a good fruity flavor.   The service was pretty good. The waitress was attentive and prompt. We all liked her.   Overall, if you like salt, you'll love this place. If you have high blood pressure...STAY AWAY! Can't say I'd return.",

The Bibimbap was visually appealing, well priced, and very flavorful - the only downside was the \"wagu\" beef was too chewy and inedible. The sea bass noodles were flavorful but well overpriced ($11 more than the bibimbap). Avoid the booth seats as they are uncomfortable as they are low, have too many leather edges that were hard. Good service though!",

It did take a minute to get our drinks but the bartender apologized and took care of us. The host finally sat us down at our table which was a disappointment. We were crammed to the table next to us and the lights were so bright, also the tables were so long it was hard to hear my boyfriend talk. We moved to the bar, which was less crowded and much more intimate. The service at the bar was great! The sushi was amazing, probably the best we have had in Pittsburgh. We were very pleased with the final result, great food & bar atmosphere!",

But worse was than that was the food.  The chicken lettuce wraps were such a small portion we almost laughed when it was brought to the table.  Brown and mushy was how to describe our dishes.  Nothing tasted freshly cooked and my grilled shrimp tasted more microwaved than grilled.  The atmosphere was of a tired, no longer vibrant restaurant.  We had no more than 10 diners eating around us.  Due to so many lightbulbs being burnt out, many were using their phones to read the menu.  Even the men's bathroom disappointed, as it was in a state of disrepair, with black garbage bags over the broken sinks.    With all of the amazing restaurants in the city, I will never be back and would never recommend it.",

The decor is just gorgeous, from the opium den with projected smoke on the walls to the main dining area featuring giant statues surrounded in candles, and a beautiful open kitchen where you could occasionally catch a giant fire cooking your food, I couldn't stop admiring my surroundings! The extra effort in decor is what pushed this wonderful place to a five star!  Honestly, starting with the decor was tough because the food was just as much to be admired! We ordered sharing plates as the waitress suggested some dishes serve 2-4. She's was correct! The sushi was delish! Be sure to try the Pop Rocks. Who knew that Pop Rocks on sushi made so much sense? Another stand out dish was the truffle risotto, with giant scoop of truffle butter that had to be mixed at the table. For those who hate truffle oil flavor - you will appreciate the use of multiple mushrooms to achieve flavor without dousing it in truffle oil.  It's a bit on the sweet side which I adored. The sangria was the best I've had anywhere! It featured seasonal blackberries and pomegranate. Today, I'm featuring a 'worth it' hangover!",

    "text": "I've been hearing about Social House Seven for weeks..months, even. I was so excited to try it out. We figured that a Tuesday evening would be a great date night. Unfortunately this fortune cookie has crumbled.  In pictures and walking by, this place looks like a trendy, upscale restaurant for the theatre crowd looking to get a bite before a show or a night out downtown. It has all the makings of a great restaurant. From the moment you walk in, you are greeted by a coy pond underneath your feet and Asian decor that leaves no detail left behind.  But what was left behind was the fish in my sushi. Never before have I eaten a roll that was 80/90% rice. The sushi wasn't the only thing that was bland. The entrees, though clever, were also a bit bland and certainly overpriced. We tried the pork dumplings, spicy tuna roll, coconut fried rice, hamachi robata, and chicken with hidden dragon sauce. As we took bites of everything, we expected an explosion of flavor and exotic pairings on traditional classics. Unfortunately, all I can remember is a vaguely ginger protein dish--where everything tasted basically the same.  I know that the restaurant is trying for a dim sum or tapas vibe, but then you need to commit to smaller (cheaper) portions and punch up the flavor profile of each serving.   The restaurant is still an interesting place to visit, especially where Asian restaurants are already lacking downtown. However, I would only come back to visit it as more of a cocktail spot rather than commit to a full dinner.  Looking back at the reviews...Huyen really hit the review on the head here!  If you're downtown and looking for an Asian meal, it could be worth checking out.",

    "text": "Finally - an Asian restaurant downtown that is not greasy takeout. This place is super trendy from the decor to the food. We came in on a Friday evening and it was very lively - a little TOO lively. The bar area was packed and even started evading into the dining section. If you don't like the sound of drunk people shouting at each other during your meal, this may not be the best place to go for dinner.   I was impressed with their large selection of vegetarian options. I started off with the Green Forest Roll, the only vegetarian roll on the menu. I'm not usually picky with my sushi but this was pretty bland and tasteless. Not something I would recommend. For my main entree, I ordered the Spicy Tofu. I was very unpleasantly surprised when I found out it didn't come with rice. Such a disappointment. The glaze on the tofu was delicious though - similar to a teriyaki sauce but better. The biggest downside was the amount of oil the vegetables and tofu were drenched it. I would say overall it was a 6/10. For dessert, we had to try the fortune cookie but it definitely looks a lot better than it tastes. The cookie itself was delicious but I was not a fan of the cream filling. Pro tip: fill it with ice cream and it would be a 10/10.  Overall, I'm not too thrilled about this place. Noise level was obnoxious and food was mediocre. It is definitely worth a try if you're downtown, but I don't see myself making a second visit.",

    "text": "I was beyond excited to check out this new restaurant and unfortunately it was not everything I hoped it would be. We went here for a friends birthday dinner and the restaurant was so loud that you had to yell just to hear the person next to you. We couldn't talk as a group because it was so loud which was unfortunate since we came here to celebrate a friend together. In addition to that the restaurant is extremely crowded. I felt like the wait staff was constantly right on top of us as they were walking by.   As for the food, we all agreed that our food wasn't amazing. I knew coming here that this was more of a tapas style dining experience so a lot of us ordered a few options for ourself. It all came out randomly but it came one after another. Thankfully my friend next to me wasn't eating so I could take up extra space for all the plates. The portion sizes are also so random. Some are super tiny and others are gigantic. If it's meant to be tapas style then the portions should be more consistent. I went with the spicy tuna roll and it was just average. It was probably the best thing I had but I've definitely had way better sushi. The soba noodles I got were also just ok. They had a nice flavor but I probably wouldn't order it again. Lastly, I ordered the ramen bowl which I would not recommend. My friend and I both didn't eat ours after we too one bite because the broth had a terrible taste.   I've either heard people rave about this place or complain about this place so I definitely wouldn't discourage anyone from checking it out at least once. The restaurant itself is beautiful!",

I came here for lunch and was very pleasantly surprised after reading the mixed reviews, but the food we ordered was great!  My friend and I shared the poke sushi burrito and the bibimbap. Both were so flavorful and well-prepared. Flavors were bold and balanced. The waiter mentioned that all the dishes are meant to be shared. While the burrito was easily shareable among two people, the bibimbap bowl was difficult to split, mainly because it was a rice bowl. While I didn't mind this, I'm not sure if \"shareable dishes\" was 100% accurate for all menu items. I can get over this, though. Next time, I probably won't share!  For lunch, Social House Seven was empty. I'd be curious to see if it livens up for dinner service. Looks like I'll have to find out!",

    "text": "I am still unsure if I truly like this place. I think that this experience is a lot better than my last one. But still I am on the fence because something always has to happen that makes me question coming here again or just shaking my head. This time it was the host asking for the menu back and me stating we were going to keep it since we were just ordering on the fly and might want one to look over. The host then said, well, if you want to do that then you can ask for it back but until then can you give it to me. I was taken aback, like...um...? Ok? I looked over to the fellow ladies at the table and we were all like, \"did that really happen?\" We told our waitress who was appalled and she got the menu back for us and apologized, she on the other hand was wonderful, attentive, and super great, not her fault that that happened at all! But still it is little things like this that make me suggest other places than Social House Seven. Because when you are out celebrating a birthday and MAY order more food and you state that, why the heck would you take the menu away from a customer? Super weird.  The food this time I will say I enjoyed a lot better. I picked some of the stuff that I had before and it tasted better this time around.   Food: Appetizers:  THAI LETTUCE WRAPS:Grilled chicken, carrots, daikon, sprouts, peanut dipping sauce. These were really good. And they came pre-made with three on a dish. The three part worked out since there were three of us at dinner! The wraps tasted like standard lettuce wraps. I would like to see a better/more flavorful sauce pairing but they were really good.   Noodles: RAMEN: Pork belly, pork shoulder, bamboo shoots, scallions, spinach, soy sauce egg, shoyu broth. Last review I was not super excited about this but this time I was actually feeling a little under the weather and wanted some soup. It was really good for my tummy to eat something like this. The salt was not as much as before and I did not leave feeling bloated. Better but I will say that the veggies overtook the bowl and I didn't realize that the meat was mostly at the bottom of the bowl. So as I was eating the noodles and the veggies the meat was just dropping to the bottom of the bowl. It ended up that I had a bowl of meat forgotten about and next time I will have to remember to look for more of the meat. I just thought that the meat portion was small and in-fact it was a lot larger and just being missed because of how I was eating the dish.   Robata: SHRIMP SKEWERS:Lime, cilantro. These were great. They were smokey grilled and the lime and cilantro made them taste like summer. I would have gotten three more of these if we would have thought about it. But we ordered this after we ordered the other food, so it was more like a palate cleanser! But so good. There were three shrimp on the skewer so this again worked out in our favor.   Sushi: SHRIMP TEMPURA:Cucumber, avocado, tobiko, house teriyaki. Standard shrimp tempura sushi. Really good and a nice little appetizer before dinner.   Dessert: LYCHEE CREME BRULEE. This was amazing. Fresh fruit on top a nice crispy sugar layer. Creme brulee is my favorite type of dessert and this was a really good version of it. YUM.  So this visit was a lot better than the last time. I am still waiting for the perfect trip. Maybe someday!  Also as a funny side note. I went to the bathroom and the stall that I used the toilet seat was not screwed down to the toilet. So I went to sit down and I slid off the toilet and almost into the bowl! I had a little bit of a laugh, and told the staff. But it seems whenever I go here there has to be something!!",

    "text": "Give it a 5 for ambition.  The rest falls somewhere below that.  Lots of interesting ideas.  Unique preparations.  But...the food falls just a little short.    Do I love any place that tries new things? (Pop rocks in sushi, buzz buttons and dry ice with drinks) Yes.  Did those things turn out as amazing as I'd hoped?  No.    Originally started reviewing this as a 3 overall and then realized I was reminiscing about all the really fun things and 3 was too low.   This seems like it would be an amazing happy hour hangout.  The drinks, while not out of this world, were fun and innovative.  I had a sake boat (which was like an irish car bomb but with sake and bud light) that sort of missed the mark with the crappy beer.  I'm thinking next time maybe Sapporo?  I had a drink with a buzz button, \"Szechuan Buzz\" (little saliva-inducing edible flower that makes your mouth feel like it's \"buzzing\") and one with dry ice that I can't remember the name of (always a fun effect).  But none of the drinks I ordered were actually good drinks.  They were just...fun.  Novel.  A friend ordered a bourbon drink \"Yuzu Spice\" that was a bit strong for her, but I tried it and it was actually the best drink we ordered.  The appetizers (steer clear of the bok choy, which came to the table a bit gritty and had to be taken off the bill) ranged from good to great, with the Ki King Broccoli being hands down the best, and the Chee Chee Fried Brussels Sprouts giving my Pittsburgh favorites a run for their money.  The shishito peppers underwhelmed, the bonito flakes sometimes gave them a fishy taste that was offputting and the peppers were on the mild side.  The Jicama Spring Roll seemed bland, but I also didn't dip it in anything.    The Ki King broccoli and Chee Chee fried bussels sprouts deserve another mention.  The broccoli was completely different than  any preparation I'd had before and it was amazing.  I'd have ordered more.  I'd have eaten it all night.  It's that good.  The brussels sprouts too...it seems like everyone is on board the brussels sprouts express right now, but these were as good as any place in the city...and I've tried a LOT of brussels sprouts.   We didn't actually order the entrees, but got a little sushi.  I ordered the roll with pop rocks, and initial bites were a little...\"off\".  I got a really strong candy taste in the first one, and it was sort of jarring.  I think it was just a bad bite though, the rest was really good, although the pop rocks themselves weren't really contributing much to the overall taste.  The Poke Aloha was great.  I'd recommend steering clear of the Pop Rocks and trying that (unless you, like me, need the new experience.  Just to see).    Service was great.  The waitress was high energy (I think you have to be, the place was loud and busy).    Atmosphere was great...if you like loud and high energy.    Great place for happy hour/bachelor party/groups...not great for fine dining/date night.  Next time I'll try the entrees and skip the specialty drink menu.",

    "text": "Take a step inside and look beneath your feet; There are elegant koi fish swimming there, separated only by a sheet of thick glass. If this gives you any idea, this is the type of posh ambience you're in store for when eating at Social House. From the giant sculpted dieties above the luxe dining booths to the unnecessarily chic bathrooms, everything in the place reads  \"Exotic Foods and Expensive Cocktails\".  Our waiter was either the chef also or had once BEEN a chef, because he made us recommendations and spoke knowledgeably of the menu items with such a thick French accent that I picked it up after appetizers (which my friend made fun of me for, justifiably). We both ordered apps and shared. He ordered the Duck Crepe (read with a French accent). We both really enjoyed it. I love a good Confit. I ordered the Breakfast of Champions on Chef Waiter's request. Bacon wrapped Quail Egg with Wasabi Maple Glaze= Glorious. I liked the daikon potato salad, but the crisp texture didn't win my pal over. Then came the sushi. As is tradition for me, I order the most gimmicky sushi roll on the menu. Pop Rocks roll is exactly what it sounds like: Sushi + Pop Rocks. It had shrimp, asparagus, and avocado inside with crab stick, tobiko, and a spicy aioli sauce on top. The texture contrast and popping sensation made this the most unique and unexpectedly awesome roll I've eaten in ages! I can't recommend it enough! We shared sushi rolls too, and he got the Godzilla roll: Scottish Salmon, Cream Cheese, and Scallion topped with seared spicy tuna, seaweed salad, tobiko, spicy aioli and house teriyaki. I was especially into the seaweed salad, and the roll as a whole was quite good. Overall, it was a cool dining experience. I only knocked off a star because the majority of the staff barely acknowledged us and could have helped out instead of letting Chef Waiter run around like crazy doing everything. It was 3 pm on a Wednesday and pretty dead... But possibly they were too busy discussing their favorite style of Abercrombie and Fitch tee. The swanky atmosphere usually isn't up my alley, but this was alright. It was like if Victoria Beckham decided to open a sushi restaurant instead of doing a clothing line.  Still, I'll probably go back during lunch to try their sushiritos. I will go hard on a good sushirito!",

    "text": "I have to agree with Toni on this one with the three star rating.  I love the concept, but it just wasn't all there and I think there are far better sushi/Asian fusion restaurants in Pittsburgh.  My recommendation would be to come here before or after dinner, but not actually for dinner.  Unless you're doing apps and drinks - their apps are good.  A group of us girls had reservations last Friday for 8:45 and we didn't end up arriving until around 9.  We were quickly seated and a few minutes later our server stopped by.  He was nice, knowledgeable and patient with our group.  We decided to order our drinks and appetizers/meals at the same time so that we didn't have to keep stopping our conversation.  I ordered an extra dirty martini and while the flavor was there, it had ice throughout it and I thought that was a little odd.  Other girls enjoyed their craft cocktails. Someone ordered the broccoli appetizer and was nice enough to let us try - it was excellent.    One of my girlfriends and I split three rolls. We did the volcano roll, spicy tuna roll and Philadelphia roll.  I don't think there was anything at the table that anyone absolutely didn't enjoy.  I enjoyed the sushi and the fish tasted fresh, however the fish to rice ratio was way off.  Tiny portions of fish were in these large, rice-y rolls.  Flavor was good, but as I mentioned, I think there is definitely better sushi flavor-wise and texture-wise in the Burgh...especially for what Social charges.   You are paying for the atmosphere, which is trendy and modern.  It is a great place for a happy hour or drinks.  Both times I have been here it's been absolutely packed, but have never had an issue getting a drink.  The restrooms are clean and the place itself is spacious.  I anticipate I will be back time and time again to Social because it's a unique setting for Pittsburgh, but I cant say I would come racing back for dinner.",

The dumplings were small and generic, wings were under-seasoned/bland, miso soup was overwhelmingly miso-y (way too much miso added, extremely salty), the kani salad consisted primarily of curled cucumbers soaked in mayo dressing w/ 3 pieces of crab meat, the seaweed salad was fine/typical but the portion was too small, the pork belly skewers had excessive sauce and breading on them which was too heavy to stomach. The sushi was fine, nothing to rave about our complain about.   On top of all this the dishes are overpriced. It's a shame to pay so much for food that you can buy pre-made/frozen and heat up yourself.  I do not recommend coming to Social for dinner, particularly do not bring guests. Happy hour + sushi will be your best bet.",

This is another Amp'd restaurant (Ten Penny, Steel Cactus, Local) and this very much fits in with the rest of their portfolio. In my opinion, they always absolutely nail the atmosphere and Social House 7 does not disappoint in that aspect! It's totally beautiful inside. I was kind of blown away at first - you walk in over a koi tank and when you enter the actual restaurant it's Asian-inspired and swanky. Totally stunning.  I was with a group of girls and our server explained that the menu was sort of an Asian Tapas style, which lends itself well to lots of sharing. I would never come here with my boyfriend... as he's not down with that :) but the style of this place makes it perfect for a girls night. We decided to go with some sushi, a bunch of appetizers, and some robata. Everything was okay, but nothing was super memorable one way or another. I was expecting to be blown away by the food but wasn't in love with anything that I tried.  We all tried the drink on special, which involved Midori and dry ice. The drink itself isn't something I would order more than one of - it was pretty sweet - but having one was totally enjoyable and the presentation was awesome.  Would I go back? Yes! I would really like to go back with some girlfriends and explore more menu items. Also, I want to make a later reservation and stick around, as the place turns into a club after a certain point. We didn't get to stay as we had other plans.  All in all, my experience at Social House 7 was pretty good but I definitely think it has all the potential in the world! I'll definitely check it out again.",

The lychee martini I had was sooo good and for my main meal I ordered Pad Thai. I sent it back. The noodles were a good flavor but the chicken wasn't what I was used to when I normally order Pad Thai. Seemed like chicken pieces I could saute up at home and throw on top. Wasn't impressed at all. The atmosphere and the decor....BEAUTIFUL. Impressive looking restaurant. I would probably come back to see what the night life was like and maybe try the sushi next time if I chose to eat here again.",

    "text": "Went to Social House Seven 10-19-18. It was not packed for a Friday and it took a 15 mins before server got to us another 10 mins before drinks... ridiculously slow service. Also, no cold water, the bottle of water always warm... wtf??? Another 5 mins before server takes our order? I did see he had plenty of time to chat to other tables. So 30 mins there and we place our appetizer order and main dish orders. Now the trouble really begins... appetizer is the wrong one we ordered edamame hummus not the bowl of spicy edamame, next the house chicken dish is about 2 or maybe 3 oz of chicken that was extremely spicy and even over cooked / fried. Please note this a $14 dish and not served with rice or noodle. That's extra. Oh... also I could never get the attention of the server to rectify any problem. I've been here before and liked it, I'm just wondering what the hell happened???",

    "text": "Ugh. I have been dying to eat at Social House ever since it opened & I was hoping I liked it better than I did. For now, it's pretty much a solid 3 star. I've gone a few times at night for drinks, but had dinner reservations on a Friday night for 8 of us. It was a great place to go with a large group. I will start by saying that the atmosphere is literally amazing inside of Social House. The interior and vibe inside basically account for the 3 stars I have given it. Like a lot of other reviewers have said, it reminds me of a swanky NYC restaurant. It really is stunning!  The service was just OK- nothing extravagant about it but nothing wrong with it. Everything seemed to take a little longer than it should have, which was fine since we were there to catch up with each other anyways. Because it did take a little while to be served, we ended up ordering our drinks and food at the same time. My friend and I started with the Ki King Broccoli as an app. This broccoli was so good and very unique from anything I've ever had! It was tempura fried and had some kind of sesame sauce. For dinner, everyone at the table ordered sushi rolls. They had a lot of options but the Volcano roll caught my eyes pretty quickly! Others at the table got the California Roll, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Godzilla Roll. Our waiter brought the sushi rolls out at all different times, which I thought was kind of weird.  As far as the sushi goes... nothing special. Everyone at the table agreed that we have had much better sushi (and for cheaper!)   As far as Social House goes, I would say that you are for sure paying for the atmosphere and experience of this restaurant. It's a great addition to the Pittsburgh restaurant scene, just wish the food wowed me a little bit more!",

My server walked me through gluten-free options, which I appreciated. The menu looked amazing and interesting, but I have to say it was not impressive.  I ordered the Breakfast of Champions (description sounded amazing) but I was underwhelmed. The quail egg was thoroughly cooked and the bacon was fatty and chewy, so I had to spit lots of it into a napkin (sorry!) because you literally couldn't break it down in your mouth. Loved the idea but the execution was disappointing.  Also ordered the tuna tartare and that was good! Brussels sprouts are also good. Sushi was ok.  A couple of people at our table mentioned that their food was REALLY salty (I know the miso soup was one of the over-salted items). Our table got the creme brulee and fortune cookie desserts. Both were good. So, I guess my point is that the food doesn't measure up to the aesthetics. If you stick with drinks and socializing, you will enjoy yourself. Reminds me of Nakama, back in the day.",

The food is really where I had the issue.  The sushi menu is pretty limited - I'd definitely choose something else next time.   However, this day, I came looking for sushi.  I ordered two rolls - one topped with poke.  They were both underwhelming.  The poke was bland and boring as the rolls were too.  Nothing special at all.    A glass of house wine and the two rolls came to $40.  I don't mind spending it, but I definitely had a better lunch for far less.",

It was a half circle booth, and it felt a little cramped.  We requested a regular table instead, and were given one, but the hostess was clearly none too pleased to oblige.  She moved us begrudgingly.  Whatever.  So we sat at our table, and our server eventually came over to explain how food will come out when it's ready, not the whole ticket at once.  Ugh.  When I read the reviews, I thought the service just sucked.  But when I heard her say that that's actually how they do it, I was not thrilled.  I mean, I get it, but I don't like it.  I'm not into tapas because of the small portion sizes.  This is not tapas style, as she compared it.  The portions are normal, if not large.  They're just purposely sending out random food at random times.   One cup of soup came out and was the only thing on the table for at least 5 minutes.  Awkward.  Then a salad came out.  Then two more salads.  Then a bowl of edamame.  Then another salad.  Then one plate of sushi.  Then another plate of sushi.  I get that some things will be done before others, but I don't understand why it's difficult to put four salads out on the same ticket at the same time.  Dumb.  Whatever.   Oh, and it also took a ridiculous amount of time to get a cocktail and an iced tea, which also came out at completely different times.  Really...?  And had I known every sushi roll I ordered was going to be just a California roll with a different piece of fish in it, I would have gotten others.  The menu kind of mislead me on that.    Most everything we all got was good, and I really don't have any food complaints.  I would not go all the way downtown again to get that specific experience again, though.  If I were already down there and wanted a California roll, maybe.  But I'll not plan an evening around that restaurant ever again.   AND good luck getting a refill on whatever drink you had.  Neither of us was asked if we wanted another, and my boyfriend's iced tea glass sat empty for the last half of the meal.",

Nobody behind the bar seemed to want to be there.  Friday night, holiday weekend and the place was DEAD.  No one was unpleasant towards me but no one was friendly either.  It just seems like they don't care.  Not a great experience.  Although the bar open to the street was nice and I could see how the place could be popular.  Just the food and service was no good.",

We wanted to sit at the bar , so we also had the treat of watching the wood fired grill. Our superbly knowledgeable waiter suggested some excellent items, so we were glad for the advice. There are some great local beers on tap as well.  I want to come back with my adventurous friends for a great meal, in a great space--it's decorated superbly as well--kudos to the staff: at least 4 people thanked us on the way out, and it didn't feel like they were from a 'Stepford Wives' remake--just nice folks.",

We didn't want to wait any longer so luckily we found another spot on the street. The interior of this place is breath taking and I really did appreciate the level of detail that went into building this place. The food was excellent nonetheless; however, portions are very small. I can't attest to all of their dishes being this way, but what my mother and I ordered was small. I left the restaurant still hungry. The flavor of my dish was incredible though and I could have ate more of it no doubt! My dish was the short rib yaki noodles ($16)! My mom ordered the scallop pad thai ($19) which she also really enjoyed but also agreed more noodles would have been nice. I would like to come back for a late dinner and drinks. Maybe try out their sushi options or even the ramen.",

The portions are low-- my entree contained two (2) pieces of lamb, neither more than a bite each. There was nothing to accompany the lamb except three cold, sinewy pieces of asparagus. The bimbimbop had 4 pieces of meat sitting atop a large bowl of oily white rice. The monkfish skewers are basically tasteless, so you're given a cold sauce that tastes like salad dressing. Most of the dumplings only come in pairs.   tl;dr: overpriced, small portions that aren't as tasty as they are pricey.",

It was an interesting design.  I had to try the pop rocks sushi and while I don't normally like asparagus I loved this. The flavor combination was interesting and the texture of the pop rocks with the flavor mix made this something different than anything I've ever had.  I liked pretty much everything else, the coconut fried rice and chicken were both among the better items I had.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the shrimp skewers. I wasn't a big fan of the marinade they were in but considering everything else was good it's a place I'd be willing to go back to.",

The ramen was lacking in spice and flavor. The soshito peppers were good. They ran out of the dessert we ordered after they gave a strong recommendation. The bartenders and staff were all pleasant but not very competent. While we were at the bar and I ordered their signature drink, I saw a confused scramble for the correct ingredients along with frequent consulting of a sheet of paper with the recipe. This did not inspire confidence. Neither did the fact that dishes were frequently handed to the wrong people and getting the checks split right took multiple attempts.   The one plus is the bartender gave a neat little Szechuan button which was fun on the tastebuds.",

Then I said to her, a card for what, she then proceeds to tell me to go to the bar and 'try' to order from there.   This hostess should absolutely either be retrained or FIRED. I travel a lot for work and I know what good customer service/respect is and this hostess has zero of any customer service or respect.  This establishment gets '3' stars, due to the excellent service from the bartender who took my order, apologized for the rude service/lack of service from the hostess.  Also the meal was good, if I ever return to this place, I hope I never see that hostess again, and if I do, I will be asking for her manager to complain about her lack of customer service.",

The room had no one else in it at the time, but was omg so muggy and hot... even the servers complained how uncomfortably hot it was. Although some air conditioning was turned out, it was decidedly too hot to consume much food or drink.  Our waitress was not the worst I've had but she ranked right up there. She took 15 minutes to get our drink order. I asked for my sake to be shaken if it wasn't very cold... she brought it back to our table and it was barely with a chill. When I said that, she replied,\"well I put it on the ticket.\"  Wth? Any other server would've taken it back and had it done right. Nope. She just left it there. Later I had to ask for ice myself. Before we ordered, she recommended her \"favorites\"... scallop pad Thai was one of them. I love pad Thai! I asked her if they could spice it up for me a little. Then my friend got an array of gluten free food that she was anxious to try after studying the restaurant menu the night before.  The only thing either one of us got that was edible was: for me- overpriced sushi, and for her- mushroom risotto with truffle butter and bok choy. Here's the disappointment: scallop pad Thai was NOT your mama's pad Thai nor anywhere close to Nicki's Thai (highly recommend and just a block or so away from Social house) ... it was over salted, had some sort of nutmeg and cayenne spices that were discernible ... but devoid of plum sauce and only a small couple of peanuts and edamame (yes, edamame). The scallops were good. But two were not worth the price of this extraordinarily bad dish.  Now comes the worse part:  they ruined the  Romanesco! When it came to our table after being prepared on the Robata (Japanese grill), dolloped with creamy feta on top) we were excited... but alas, you couldn't get your fork through it (still raw!). If you ever had Romanesco prepared correctly, you will know the disappointment that we had with this dish. We asked the server to have the kitchen cook it some more, she took the plate, asking us to remove the one we'd tried! Do you know how many good restaurants just bring you a new fresh order and not put the food that you've had your forks in sent back to the kitchen for recooking with every other diner's orders?!?? Alas the waitress came back and the vegetable was still tough. She offered to remove it from our check... but didn't. I had ordered more sake and twenty minutes later she'd forgotten that too. We got our checks and got the heck outta there... only after parting with a $150 check. The thrill is gone with the Social house. I wonder what will be the next restaurant in this space once others experience the same disappointment we did?",

The edamame is a little oily for me, but I'm trying to be really conscious about oily food. They also have a great bar.

We also ordered a spicy tuna roll and it was huge, we ended up having to take some home. My only complaint was that the spicy tuna was almost too spicy! I love spicy food and handle it well, but wow my mouth was on fire. I recommend taking some caution with it! We also were given two pieces of heart shaped sushi for Valentine's Day which we thought was a cute touch. Personally, we weren't fans of that roll because it included cream cheese but we appreciated the gesture!!  As a recommendation, I suggest ordering multiple things from the sushi menu as well as the appetizers and sharing them. The portions are the perfect sharing size and that way you get to try a little bit of everything. My favorite of the appetizers we ordered was the eggrolls, they had pork on the inside which was wonderful addition. Highly recommend!!",

Needless to say went w $8 to start. Bar service was very slow, could see our server waiting to get drinks and seemed like only 2 bartenders.   I tried to be open to the concept of the \"food arrives in any order & whatever comes out first\". But salads cane out last...this makes no sense. We barely touched them. Our server advised to order 2-3 things and share. I ordered a salad, yellow tail roll & Alaskan crab roll. Crab roll cane first, good, but not anything amazing. The rock shrimp was the best thing I ate. This was actually too much food. Could have gotten away w 1.5 per person.  The pad Thai was so spicy, we didn't recall it saying anything about the spice level. Barely eaten. My yellow tail roll never arrived & so I cancelled it. The rolls were pretty pricy, anything with decent fish was $15-$18. One person ordered the \"pop rock roll\". Too weird, why ruin fresh, tasty fish with chemical junk?! Keep the candy for the kids, keep the sushi classy.  Not for me.",

Overall the food was okay, not bad but nothing special. Our favorite was the bi bim bap. The \"Korean BBQ\" sauce added a nice zing and the veggies were fresh. Portion size is generous too. However the service was lackluster - even with only one other table in the restaurant, we ended up having to wait for we to come take our order or get refills. Really not sure I would come back here for lunch. The ambience seems like it would be better suited for a date night or happy hour.",

There were Koi Fish under the floor. The place was really oddly set up based just on seating. The facility can open the large wall/windows and see the outside which is nice for summer.   The seating was my only thing I did not really like. You face everyone in the crowd rather than facing each other. It was also pretty hot in there; even our waiter was sweating.   I could've drank 18 waters, it was like I was lacking liquids a lot.   Anyhow, I'm not really good at picking different food but ordered edamame, lettuce wraps and I strictly remember the pop rocks roll with actual CANDY on it. How cool?   I could sit there, sweating with you for a long time as long as the water was being refilled.",

    "text": "Having never had sushi as a team we decided to go \"different\" in our search for later food on a Friday evening. Came upon this spot via yelp in a the downtown area which has several restaurants and nightclubs in the vicinity.   This is a very large place with outdoor seating on the sidewalk where the windows fold away and there is a bar in the window to sit at. Plus there is inside seating at both tables, bar, and half circle booths. Problem with asking for a booth was that you face everyone else and it is somewhat awkward.   Went with the edamame and lettuce wraps for appetizers. Edamame was well salted and plentiful. Funny I used to eat these religiously and back eating them again. The lettuce wraps were a build your own style - would've liked more a a stronger lettuce leaf but still good.   For entree we just shared three sushi rolls - Godzilla, volcano, and pop rocks. Yes the candy. Pop rocks was my favorite - somewhat on the spicy side but it literally has pop rocks that crackle in your mouth. Not sure if it's done elsewhere but I liked it. Volcano and Godzilla rolls were good as well.   MY BIGGEST ISSUES COME with the neighborhood and the intermingling of the two. On the walk in this Jimmy Bombooch dude in all white suit items and a blue vest was handing out cards to the club across the street- and was VERY SLIMY approaching people. Also on our way to the front door heard another guy say same and try and solicit people. It's not like this was a co-sponsoring- it was heavy solicitation and really a turnoff for me. Also - the problem is these people were freely walking through the restaurant and acting very odd.   Nice place- funky decor and after I believe 10? A a dance floor and lighting. I guess I'm getting old and don't want to mess with that?   Good sushi!!",

It's a neat mix of Japanese, Chinese, and American industrial gothic (I think I just made that up lol.)  There is a side room behind the sushi bar with a large buddist deity.  We sat in a booth. The booths are half oblong circles like you'd see in night clubs of the 1950's, and they're on a platform raised about a foot off the ground. It gave a nice vantage point of the rest of the space.  We started off with a couple mules. They were awesome - totally relaxed us.  I sipped mine, my companion downed hers and got a second one.  For lunch I couldn't make up my mind!  I wanted to sample it all. I picked the short rib yaki. It was good (but it didn't knock my socks off the way the mule did.)

But every time I come back to the Poke Aloha roll. To the extent that my group of friends will just ordered 2-4 orders of just that roll. (Pictured is 3 orders of Poke Aloha and a rainbow roll hiding in the back). We sometimes mix it up and will start with the spicy edamame which is incredible. The spices are the perfect balance will a kick but nice salty touch that I like when eating edamame from the shell.   I have never had a bad experience at Social. It is a great date night spot, or a place to go to hang out with friends. The drinks are always on point and they take reservations, although that is usually not a problem.   We have found that the booths are absolutely fantastic for people watching but a little tough to communicate if there are actually 4 of you sitting in the booth. If I have 4 people in my party, I try to request a table. If it is just a friend and I, we will sit at the bar because the chairs/ two seater benches make conversation a lot easier and not quite as distracting.   I will say whoever was bartending on June 7, 2017 around 8-10 pm was absolutely fantastic. I did not catch her name, but she has apparently been with social since they opened and she knew how to make quality cocktails. If I am back and she is on shift I will most definitely be ordering a Hendricks dirty martini with olives.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is very nice, it feels more on the fancier side with many traditional decorations and lighting by candles. Seats on the outside face the rest of the restaurant, great for people watching, and seats are separated from each other so it feels intimate. The menu has a wide arrangement of items, from sushi to meats to fried rice, so everyone is happy. They encourage sharing dishes here and ordering a few options, as most are not traditional entree meals. I ordered the Sesame Chicken, one of the traditional entree options. The chicken sauce was delicious, it was sweet, with a bit of spice at the end. The peppers and onion mixed in with the chicken added to the flavor and the toasted sesame seeds added a nice crunch. The chicken was tender, not fatty, and fresh out of the oven. My dish also came with white rice, helping to complete the dish and fill me up. Overall a great experience and recommend for a higher end meal.",

    "text": "Friday night out on the town.  I made reservations a few months in advance because we were seeing a show.  Then I tried to change them and they were booked up.  I am not going to review sushi.  It is sushi.  It is good and a spicy tuna roll will be a spicy tuna roll where ever you go (usually).  However, they do have some specialty rolls that are intriguing.  We were drawn to the Pop Rocks.  Yes, folks, real pop rocks candy.  The roll actually \"pops\" when it is brought to your table and in your mouth.     My real review is about service.  Our server was awesome.  He was thoughtful, personable and himself.  He wasn't trying to sell us, but just making a comfortable situation where the food might be a little uncomfortable.  He told us food comes out when ready so eating in rounds is the way to do it, and he was timely with drinks and check ups.  Alex (AKA Kissee) is the man.  We had a mis communication on leaving a cash tip so we had to go back to give him the money and we got actual hugs. Actual hugs, you can't buy that.",

    "text": "I went to Social House 7 with a couple of my friends last week. Our waitress, Mar, was super friendly (super!) and she was very helpful and informative about all of the menu items. Our party just ordered things off of the menu to share. We got the edamame, shishito peppers, and the volcano roll. Then individually, my one friend got the scallops, my other friend got the Brussels salad, and I ordered the spicy Kani salad and curried chicken soup. The food came out quickly and was plated nicely. Everything we tried was delicious! When my soup came out, I could tell from the smell that I was not going to like it. But I decided to taste it just in case. After tasting the soup, I definitely confirmed that I didn't like it. I set the soup off to the side and enjoyed the other snacks on the table. Mar came up to me and noticed that I didn't eat the soup and asked if I didn't like it. I told her I thought it was going to be something different and no, I did not like the soup. (I had planned to pay for it because o ordered it-- it's not the restaurants fault I didn't like it). She told me she would take it off the bill and asked if I would like to try the miso soup instead. I was stuffed from our other food so I declined, but her customer service alone makes for my 5 star rating. I liked the atmosphere and the customer service at Social House -- and the food also of course-- I will definitely be back!",

We started out with appetizers: calamari and the duck crepes. The calamari was delicious but the duck barely contained any duck and was more of a flatbread than a crepe. Our waiter seemed a bit distracted although there were only a few tables dining. The Bibimbap was bland with no flavor. My BF lived in S. Korea years ago and was not impressed by this dish whatsoever. The pad Thai was tasty with good flavor and a large portion. The clincher was that all of a sudden the lights were turned on very bright as we were finishing our dinners. We proceeded to question our server why turn up the lights and he said, \"well our kitchen closes at 10pm so they turn the lights on.\" Ummm.....we're not in the club; it's supposed to be a nice dining experience. I don't know that we'd go back or if so, a different day and time.",

The presentation of every dish was not less than a work of art, the flavors intertwine in the most armonios way, from the delicate flavor of truffles in the risotto, to the bold and exiting burst of flavor in the volcano roll.

    "text": "I've been here twice and while I've really wanted to like this place, I'd found myself disappointed both times. Most recently, I had their Crispy Rock Shrimp. I think I was expecting to get a spicy, Bang Bang shrimp dish. It came out with two types of shrimp. One side had a little bit of spice while the other had an orange color and even the waitress said it smelled like Doritos. The dish itself was average at best.  We also got lettuce wraps which turned out to be good kind chicken presented with green leaf lettuce. While I'm a big fan of green leaf salad, this is one of the few times that I want a nice big piece of iceberg lettuce. The chicken wraps were also average at best. For entrees, We got the Social House chicken and the Waygu. The steak was decent, but I could have gotten an equally good steak for half the price at a Longhorn steakhouse. The chicken was something that also was ok, but even my wife who likes bland food thought it was a bit bland. As far as the savory foods, the best portion was the ginger fried rice. Again, nothing great, but good enough.  The best part of the meal was the dessert which was the Fortune Cookie. It's an enormous fortune cookie with a half chocolate/half vanilla mousse that my wife and I both enjoyed.  The only reason I gave 3 stars is that we both liked the atmosphere and had a very good server. The food itself is about a 2.5.",

    "text": "We came here after a friend recommended this place. I had looked into it quite a bit, because I tend to be picky about sushi restaurants, but after looking over the menu, we decided to try it.  We got there at about 5pm, and the place was mostly empty. It did fill up a bit before we left (~630), but it may have been a slow night. That worked to our favor,  because it meant more attentive service.  We asked about happy hour specials, and we informed once we were at the table, that was only at the bar. That sucked, because I had been planning on ordering off the happy hour sushi menu since it was significantly cheaper, but we bit the bullet and stayed at the table. The one thing that did upset me was the server told me that he would get my drink on the happy hour price, and then didn't. I have no way of knowing if that drink was even part of the happy hour special, but to be charged full price after being misled that it would be discounted in any form was annoying.   I ordered the Kung Fu Punch. It kind of reminded me of a sangria-esq drink. I did like it, but not sure if I would order it again (very sweet!).  Our server explained the menu in a lot of detail (maybe more than we needed?), and gave recommendations. I did like that he told us what not to buy, because honestly sometimes it's nice to know from a customer perspective that xyz isn't very good here.   We decided on three rolls: spicy tuna, alaskan crab california, and godzilla. They were fantastic. Nothing super special in the rolls, but they did not disappoint in quality and taste. We left feeling very full. I definitely recommend splitting rolls and not doing more than 3 or 4 of them, because you certainly fill up quick!  We didn't drink any more than that one drink because we did not get the happy hour menu (and the cocktails were fairly $$$) so unfortunately I cannot attest to any other drinks, maybe next time though?  Overall, the aesthetic and food was really good, but I was not impressed at the cost of everything, for what we got. It's pricey, so keep that in mind if you pay full price! We'll probably come back in the future, but it's not at the top of our list.",

They have $4 sake bombs and sake carafes, $5 cocktails and appetizers, and half off select sushi rolls. It makes for a great, cheap dinner. The chee chee brussels sprouts are a MUST. Even if you dont like brussels sprouts. Get them. You're welcome. I also love their giant fortune cookie dessert. It's fun to come here in a group as the food is the perfect size for sharing. The service is always friendly, but can be slow sometimes.  Social House Seven has never really disappointed me, but I think they do suffer from trying to be too many things at once. Their menu is pretty big, but that means that some items don't get as much attention as others, and the quality can vary. I recommend if you're unsure to ask your waiter for suggestions, they're always pretty honest about what to skip. The prices can be inconsistent as well. Some of the robata items are very small portions but come with a big price tag, and then there's items like the chee chee brussels sprouts that you get SO MUCH of for the price.   Overall, I'm going to keep going to Social House Seven for happy hour because it's such a great deal. And even though they have some good menu items, it wouldn't be my first choice for lunch or dinner because of the prices.",

We tried the spicy tuna sushi roll, the crunchy spicy tuna roll and the Alaskan roll in addition to the pork dumplings and brussel sprouts. Everything was good but nothing to write home about.   Service here isn't the most attentive. I had to ask several times to get water refilled and to place orders. Food did clean out fairly quickly.   Overall I think it's a good deal for happy although definitely not the best sushi I've had. Will probably come back for their happy hour.",

    "text": "I don't think I had ever heard of this place before but we came here on a recommendation from a friend before going to a show downtown. We had a great meal and would definitely be back.  The restaurant ambience kind of embraces the Asian fusion vibe, and it looks like they seem to have decor from various Eastern cultures. That could be intentional or I could be overthinking it. There's a neat atmosphere though and our service was fine.  Their happy hour specials are awesome but take note that most of them only seem to apply to bar seating. We had a table but were still able to get a half priced bottle of wine.  The menu is pretty diverse. We tried the fried brussel sprouts, fried dumplings, and a few sushi rolls. The Poke Aloha is one of the more popular ones per our server and it was fantastic. It's a tuna tartare roll with some great flavors.  If you're part of the downtown happy hour crowd, you definitely want to add this to your list of venues. Great food and great drink variety.",

Because we like to enjoy local beers, we ordered Youngling lager (Pottstown, PA) and Fat Head's Head Hunter IPA (North Olmsted, OH - not quite local, but closer than MSP!). We chose this spot due to proximity to the convention center, so it was a great surprise to see so many yummy items on the menu. We sat at the bar where Jen took excellent care of us.  Because it was a bit cold and damp, I started with house miso soup. It was very flavorful and warmed me to my bones. Smokin' Hubster ordered the scallop pad thai and didn't offer me a taste or anything! I had the Chicken with hidden dragon (I don't think there were dragons in there; hidden very well!) which was filling and tasty.  The menu is impressive and we'd work our way through it if we lived nearby.",

    "text": "Since I work downtown, it's easy to go to different places for lunch. This is the first time I've ever eaten here, surprisingly, because I love this type of cuisine. But my coworker and I went for lunch. It was by no means busy. The decor was very modern and I would imagine it to be a great place to go at night and with friends, just based on looks alone. It was dimly lit and we were sat at one of the booths that was on a riser. I can definitely see the appeal for night time drinks or if you wanted to spend a lot of money for dinner.   I was not impressed by the food or prices, however. Service was okay. It was lunch and not busy and didn't take too long for our food. But the taste wasn't incredible or anything. It LOOKED very appealing, I got ramen and it was very Americanized. They literally use ramen noodles that you would get from the orange pack. Throw in an egg with miso broth and spinach. They do put beef in there and a hearty amount of pork belly so there's no need to add on protein. It was okay. I've had better. The egg roll was not really good and it was literally sitting on a bed of broccoli slaw you get from Trader Joe's or Giant Eagle, which made me laugh. It was crispy and the inside had a kick but the meat was indiscernible, which made it not good. The sushi was fine, though. Just honestly your basic rolls and nothing too special or fresh about them and totally over priced. $9 for a basic salmon roll??!!  I wouldn't come here again. You can get more authentic cuisine like this elsewhere and for a better price. I think it's just hyped up because of the location and the decor. But I mean, try it if you'd like, it's not awful or anything.",

    "text": "I have been to this restaurant for drinks after several events, but never there to have their food.  So, when my normal lunch buddies suggested that we have lunch here during a recent date, I was down.  Now let me describe the interior of Social House 7.  Picture a giant lounging Buddha leisurely resting over the tops of several booths.  Also picture what looks like hand-planed wooden floors and Japanese inspired metal fish scale and shoji screens placed throughout the restaurant.  There are also hand-painted Geishas and floral artwork embellishing several walls in the interior.  If you're really into restaurant interiors, this restaurant's interior is the place for you.  And please don't forget to look down upon entry so that you don't miss the large koi swimming around underfoot in the floor.  Really spectacular!  It's a riff on the interior of Philadelphia's Buddakan restaurant in more ways than one.  Someone was really thoughtful about the look of this restaurant.  With regards to the food, my hungry lunch mates and I damn near ordered the entire lunch menu.  We had the Chee Chee Fried Brussels Sprouts with almonds, chili sauce and bonito flakes for $7, the Sauteed Spicy Edamame with jalapeno, garlic, sesame oil and soy for $8, the Ginger Fried Rice with ginger, scallions, garlic, onion, soy, white rice and Crispy rock shrimp(Add $5)  for $8, 2 Korean Cheesesteak sandwiches served with Bulgogi style rib eye, sweet peppers, grilled onions, cheese, and Korean BBQ sauce for $13 and last but not least, the Bahn Mi served with marinated pork tenderloin, Crouching Tiger sauce, cucumbers and cilantro for $8.  I just became exhausted listing all of that food.  I never liked Brussels sprouts as a child because my mother murdered most vegetables, with Brussels sprouts being no exception.  Social House 7's Brussels sprouts will make you change whatever pre-conceived notion that you may have about the vegetable.  Crunchy, salty, earthy and spicy...Yummy!  The Sauteed Spicy Edamame were also pretty tasty. (Just a little messy to eat.)  The Bahn Mi snuck up on me with jalapeno slices tucked into the sandwich at various intervals and ordered with Ginger Fried Rice and crispy rock shrimp, I was in Asian food heaven.  My lunch buddies were also in heaven with their Korean Cheesesteak sandwiches.  None of us could finish any of our meals and we usually act like Hoover vacuum cleaners and suck up everything in sight.  I honestly have to say that everything was really tasty.  So I was surprised that the restaurant wasn't packed because of the tastiness of the food, the reasonable prices, the wait staff service and the decor.  However, the one drawback to this restaurant is the wait times.  Oh Lord!  We received the Brussels sprouts quickly and I received my Bahn Mi sandwich quickly, but then we waited almost a century for the rest of the food.  Too bad or else I would give this place top of the morning marks.  That being said, I would still recommend this restaurant.  Just don't go there and be in a hurry.",

    "text": "My son and I stopped here for lunch before going to see our first series show at the Benedum. We were able to get seated right away and they still had the front windows open even though temperatures have now fallen.  Remembering they had a vegan menu I asked to see it. The vegan menu offers a good selection of modifications off the regular lunch and dinner menu, however, in order to find prices you have to ask for the lunch and dinner menus since they left that off. I was hoping to get the Brussel Sprouts appetizer but learned due to popularity, they were out of them. Instead I ordered the Ki king broccoli as my appetizer. My son chose the vegan green forest roll sushi for his appetizer.  They serve you with either chopsticks or regular utensils. I really wasn't expecting much in the way of appetizers but the portions of both the broccoli and the sushi were more than enough for the two of us to share. They both were very good and if I hadn't ordered a salad to go with the Ki king broccoli that could have been a meal in itself. The  sushi was also very good but a bit on the spicy side for me.  For my main salad again I wanted the crispy brussel but they were out of that as well. So I chose the sesame broccoli salad. This salad comes with sesame croquette, carrot, broccoli and more on a bed of napa cabbage. My son went with the vegan version of Bi Bim Bap with tofu on top. This dish is served with rice and I didn't want to be overfilled with eating rice.  We got our food fairly quickly. I loved my broccoli salad which although not listed on the vegan menu is a vegan salad on their website. It was very filling and quite good. My son enjoyed his Bi Bim Bap and let me sample it. The dish has a bit of a kick to it if you love spice but he loved it.   The vegan menu is something you must ask for.  In addition to that they have vegetarian and gluten free items clearly marked on the menu. We were able to use my 15% discount coupon that came with my subscriber series to save a little on the check.  This place does have a full bar but we didn't use it.  Hopefully next time I return I can try their Brussel Sprouts which they have a vegan version of.  Located on the 7th Ave downtown the restaurant is opposite the theater square garage and a block away from the Benedum Center.",

I hate to write a negative review, but after two trips a year apart, it's not getting better.   The service is always awful. You have to beg the wait staff for everything. It's ridiculous. The food is not much better. Not sure why people rave about this place. It's a giant disappointment. If you have bad food or service that's one thing but you better not have both.   The food my husband and I got was tasteless and not worth what we paid or how long we waited for it. If you spend more money on something, it better be good. This wasn't. Such a shame. We all we're going to see Hamilton, told the server that and it still too forever. They also brought out entrees one at a time which is ridiculous. Mine came last and everyone was done eating by the time mine came so they had to wait for me.   Will not be back. They need to pull it together.",

    "text": "I met up with my coworkers here while we were in town for a business trip - a group of four. Upon entering the restaurant, we passed over a clear glass floor with fish swimming around, which was pretty cool. The decor of the restaurant was really nicely put together and it was a darker lighting situation. The menu had a good variety of options, we chose a bunch of appetizers (which were all very well portioned), a few mains and four sushi options to share.  The service was a bit slow to start - it took quite awhile to get our cocktails and the restaurant didn't appear super busy. Once we had input our order, it didn't take long before the food started coming out - the apps all arrived at the same time, then the mains, and then the sushi.  I've got photos of a number of the items we ordered. The only option that I didn't care for too much was the spicy tofu -- but others in my group enjoyed it. It just wasn't fried well enough to my liking and came in two large pieces instead of cubed like I'd envisioned. The wine was half off for bottles, so for $20 you can get a whole bottle (which a couple of my coworkers decided to do), and they really enjoyed it. The best appetizers, in my opinion, were the spicy edamame (the exterior is very spicy but tasty!) and Brussels sprouts. The scallop pad Thai was quite nice and I liked the caterpillar roll best for sushi. All in all, it was a nice location and easy to Uber to. If I were to go again, I'd want to try something off the grill- there were a lot of different meat options for that.",

The server wasn't checking on us frequently and we had to wave her down to ask if the 6th person could get his meal. She said yes (no apology). Still didn't come for 15 more minutes, and at that point we need to leave for a show. So he barely ate anything. Then she brings the checks, and we were sitting in the bar area which happy hour drink specials apply until 7:00pm. We look and none of the drinks we ordered had the happy hour prices applied, so now she has to go back and re-run it all. We are now running late for our show. Still no apology. It's one thing for the meal to not get made, not her fault, but you should check on it and at least apologize. Checks are her fault. Three stars only because the food is decent.",

My mom and I got there around 6pm and got seated right away. Our waitress was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. It's a very spacious restaurant, so it wasn't packed at all.   It's a tapas restaurant, so lots of small plates. We ordered the California roll to start. It was delicious- probably my favorite thing on the menu. Next, we ordered the lettuce wraps with chicken - unfortunately- I didn't like them all.   Next up, we ordered another California roll to try and the fried shrimp - it was delicious!  Overall, I'll definitely go back again to Social House Seven!",

However, as far as the food, the sushi was disappointing. I came here with high expectations, but I've definitely had much better sushi elsewhere. We also ordered the shrimp skewers which was the best part of the meal by far. This is found under the Robata portion of the menu, offering multiple seafood, meat and vegetable options grilled on Japanese charcoal. There are other options on the menu including a long list of appetizers and some unique soups, salads and noodles/rice. I'd definitely be willing to come back and try this place again and order some different menu offerings, but the sushi was unfortunately subpar.",

The seaweed salad was dry and bland, unagi was very soggy (that is a tell tale sign of unprofessional sushi), \"king\" yellowtail had no fat marbling and the color was off, 2 of the 8 pieces of the rainbow roll where missing fish on half of each piece plus the rice inside the roll was cold potentially indicating it was premade and refrigerated, and the ramen was a bowl of bland mushy noodles and the pork belly was grey in color.    So a big nope to the sushi and ramen.  I think this restaurant has some potential, but no way I am going back.  Shame on them for serving such underwhelming food.  I'm shocked yelp reviews are so high.  If you know great sushi do not go here, and if you are expecting tentative and competent wait staff do not go here.",

Love the mix of Thai-Chinese-Japanese  The Brussels sprouts are to die for, sushi is on par with Nakama but not as good as Little Toyko(lebo), the ginger fried rice blows the saga type places out of the water!! Their signature cocktails are honestly amazing. Pair perfectly with each dish and are not too sweet or too strong. The service was on par. Young wait staff...mostly in their 20s so it had an upbeat feel. We also had the scallop and the pork skewers. The scallop had AMA I got flavor but a small serving only 3 slices...the pork skewers were great and the serving was plenty big! Very unique flavor served on cucumber slices w a great sauce. The spicy tuna roll did have a better flavor than other places but the tightness of the roll and the ratio of filling to rice was a tad off!!",

I still am giving a good review since I was there on Labor Day and they probably didn't have the regular crew in the kitchen. Let me start by saying the design of the place is very well done and something I would expect to see in Dubai. I sat at the bar since I was alone and enjoyed their cocktails menu. Interesting choices and well prepared. I had the ginger green salad and spicy tuna sushi to start. The salad was perfect, and I enjoyed the sushi until I ate one piece that a big wad of wasabi on it. It was dark so I didn't see it, but I definitely tasted it! At least it cleared my nostrils, but it was wired to find that on the sushi. I then ordered the ramen looking foreword to some nice pork belly. The noodles were so salty I couldn't eat the dish. I had to send it back, which is really rare for me. Like I said at the beginning of this review I think it was not the normal kitchen staff and I will definitely come back to try again!",

Our entrees came before our soup and salad, so I had to ask that my sushi be kept on ice while I ate my soup. The drinks were average, highly over-priced for the tiny size, and I requested orange bitters on my drink. The bartender put the bitters in the middle of the drink and my soda water on top, which defeats the whole purpose and they were completely lost in the drink. Big let down.  As for the food...the mushroom soup was very flavorful and very spicy. I enjoyed it, despite the spice level giving me a runny nose.  For dietary reasons I requested my godzilla roll without rice, and rather than just roll them up without it like every other place does, they put everything on a plate and I had to assemble my own. I ended up having sushi tacos. They were tasty, but it seems ridiculous that I couldn't enjoy a more traditional meal, sans rice.  My friend got the salad which looked nice  and he also got the poke aloha roll. It was beautiful and tasty but extremely heavy on the rice  which for me, is a bad sign and does not reflect well on the sushi chef.   All-in-all, I would say it is a nice atmosphere, but over-priced. I would also not go again at lunch because they only serve from their lunch menu and the sushi bar menu isn't available. It was a bit anticlimactic.",

It was pretty busy, but it didn't look like there was an insane wait for people wanting to eat. The drink selection was pretty decent, and the prices were pretty standard for a place downtown.  The decor is super trendy, but I can see where someone would think it might a little overwhelming. There is a coy pond when you walk in, so that was cool but also weird. There were two bars, which is a nice touch because they were both pretty busy by the time we left.The food smelled really good - I would definitely come back to try it.",

    "text": "I have been to Social House twice but the first time I only had beer so I figured i'd wait for food to happen before I judged. I have a lot of positives and a few critiques about the dinner I had there last night. I went with 3 other girls. The staff was super friendly and our waitress was really helpful and nice! She told us that they specialize in small plates. So, to say that we ordered an insane amount of food would be an understatement. I believe we ordered about 5 apps and 3 entrees to share. All of the food was fantastic!! Some of the highlights would be the chee chee brussel sprouts and the scallop pad thai. The aloha poke roll was also a big hit with everyone. I really have zero complaints about any of the food or the staff.   Now onto a few issues. While our waitress was great, i wasn't expecting some of the portions of the food to be so large because of being told it was small plates. Not generally an issue, unless you have no ability to take leftovers home and have to waste delicious, precious food!  That criticism is minor and really, who cares if the food is good? The one issue I had with the meal  what the timing. Yes, i want my food out hot, fresh and fast. But, everything came out practically at once and it made the meal pretty hectic. With this crowd... the older we get, the more anxious we get and i was pretty shocked no one needed a paper bag. I'll definitely be returning to Social House and now I am equipped with the knowledge to make the meal worth 5 stars!",

I really enjoyed the set-up of the bar and dining rooms.   Apps are served tapas style, so we stayed away from that menu as there were only two of us and we were both very hungry. The whole \"tapas\" thing in general seems like a hidden way to charge more for less if it is served in a pretty way, but maybe that's just me. That being said, just know what you are ordering so you're not disappointed. Apps menu would likely be good for a large group that likes to share.  We started with sharing a Spicy Crab salad and a caterpillar roll, both of which I enjoyed and were great to share. For our entrees, I got the Sea bass Pumpkin Noodle and my friend had the Scallop Pad Thai. I really enjoyed both of those too! I didn't read the menu close enough to realize that the noodles served with my dish were squash noodles, rather than regular noodles in a pumpkin sauce, but I was still happy with my decision. Sea bass is my absolute favorite fish and it was cooked very well, perfectly juicy and buttery. The scallops were also well-cooked and although I've never had them served with a peanut-style sauce, it was a great combination.  We decided to be ultimately indulgent and also go for dessert. We split the Fortune Cookie and we didn't leave a single crumb behind. A giant fortune cookie dipped in chocolate, topped with toasted coconut and filled with chocolate mousse. You really can't go wrong with that.",

    "text": "To sum it up: Good, but pricey and loud.   Came by around 8 on a Friday night for a drink and some food. We weren't sure if we would have dinner here or just some snacks -- we ended up sharing two plates which was dinner for me and snacks for my fiance -- due to the disparity in our appetites. We each tried one of the Japanese beers on tap. Tasty, but probably what would be considered a coors light in Japan and overpriced for a light pilsner.   We shared the spicy tuna roll and the fried brussel sprouts. Both were really tasty and a good compliment to one another. I really enjoyed both dishes but I will always believe that $10 is steep for brussell sprouts.  Another thing to note is there is kind of a party atmosphere. We sat at a window seat facing the street but a guy at a table with a party of about 8 behind us was SCREAMING non-stop and really disruptive. I wouldn't head here for a quiet, romantic meal.   Overall I liked it, but when I want to really splurge going out I have to LOVE it. There are just too many options for good Asian food in town to justify spending $40 before tip on two beers and two appetizers.",

The bartender gave us our drinks and chatted us up. She was fantastic. She was mid 20's and adventurous. She made a mad drink and kept us there longer than we should have. Service on this day at this bar was perfection.   The food looked great. The menu was nice. The place was huge and clean but the one downer.... there was no-one here. We talked to the bartender about this. She mentioned that they are working on bringing Pittsburgh back and there was an explosion of local restaurants which the city can't really handle at this point. Too many restaurants and not enough people dining at them. Which is bad for business but good as to a person's choices.",

We ordered four items to share: CHEE CHEE FRIED BRUSSEL SPROUTS, CRISPY ROCK SHRIMP, WOK CHARRED RICE CAKES, and MONKFISH SKEWERS. The brussels sprouts were delicious and the shrimp were pretty tasty. We did not like the rice cakes - they were such a weird, chewy texture. We tried to eat some as leftovers today and they had become really hard and inedible. The monkfish was just sort of bland. I also enjoyed a SAKE BOAT cocktail, which was great, though I wish I had known about their happy hour specials (I just now saw them on the website).  Our server was nice but seemed inexperienced. Another server came by and cleared one of our plates before I was finished with it, without asking, which was irritating.  I may try this place again, but it wouldn't be at the top of my list.",

They were all right, not amazing but still good. For entrees, we ordered the Bibimbap and the scallop pad Thai. The Bibimbap came with rice that was still crunchy because it was so undercooked. The scallop pad Thai was underwhelming - way over cooked scallops, atop a noodle dish that vaguely resembled pad Thai and tasted completely bland. To serve that and charge $20 is crazy. Our server was nice and made up for it by comping the Bibimbap which was appreciated. I didn't go in expecting anything mind blowing but was disappointed in the quality for the price.",

    "text": "Loved the decor of the place. Very nice details on the hanging lanterns, woodwork booths, and coy fish under the floor in the entryway. The food wasn't that great to be honest. Also, the restaurant was about 2/3 empty and instead of being seated in a both with my date, we were seated in a concentrated area of a large group, which resulted in me being hit in the back by the servers constantly bringing the group new dishes. While the servers were apologetic, it was disruptive and detracted from my experience.   The pork belly appetizer was pure fat. The wonton was friend fat. Both of these appetizers made us sick from the grease overload and had little to no flavor other than fat.   The grilled salmon and rice was much better and $14 for 5oz of salmon wasn't a bad price, but a scoop of Panda Express white rice was a cop-out side dish. The salmon wasn't terrible but it was not flavorful and had fishy undertones.   The Thai Chicken Lettuce wraps were good. No complaints.   The sea bass and pumpkin noodles my date ordered were overpriced at $24 for mediocre fish that was very thin cut. The pumpkin noodles were disappointing as they were unevenly cooked. Some were soft, some were almost raw hard, and overall bland.   I would concur with most other reviews that the decor and atmosphere are impressive and the location was good. But for nearly $100 (with Tip), I could think of 20+ restaurants in walking distance I'd rather go to. This was a $30 meal at best.   NOTE: I lived in Asia three years and none of this was authentic. So glad I avoided the sushi!",

We ordered a to-go order of dumplings, bibimbap, spicy tuna roll, California roll, and rainbow roll.    All of the sushi was bad to the point that we physically spit it out.  The avocado in the California and rainbow roll was rotting, brown, and had an awful taste.  The spicy tuna roll was just sliced tuna with scallion in a roll with spicy mayo sauce on top, definitely not a spicy tuna roll by any means.  The rice on all of the rolls was hard and barely chewable.  The maki rolls were sloppily rolled and put together.   The dumplings had very little taste, they tasted like completely bland mush.  The bibimbap was the only thing we could finish and eat and even that was below par.  Being Korean I've had my fair share of bibimbap, and its kind of hard to mess up.  Firstly, they charge $16 for plus whatever tip and tax you pay, it is definitely not worth it for this dish.  The rice, once again, was under cooked.  There was barely enough spicy sauce and none of the toppings stood out in this dish.  The beef was overly chewy to the point where you had to spit it out.    I usually give restaurants a second chance because the first time could have been a fluke.  But the fact of the matter is every single dish we got was disgusting. (how do you have undercooked rice in an Asian establishment!!???)  I will not recommend this place to anyone.",

There was one other patron at the bar when we sat down.  We were greeted quickly and given drink menus.  The drink, for us, beer prices were about standard for downtown.  Between $6-$8 for most.  Some were really high at $10.00.  We ordered quickly and asked for menus, but the bartender never brought them.  Vigilant I sent my other half to track down a menu so I could peruse it while we imbibed.   Though we didn't order anything I saw several things that I would be excited to try.

Honestly, the Fortune Cookie is one of my favorite desserts. It is a giant fortune cookie filled with dark chocolate and white chocolate mousse and it is heavenly. I love dessert but it must be shared amongst your party!",

I also tried their seasonal punch which was really good but if their sushi is the main thing then THUMBS DOWN on that. We ordered the shrimp tempura, volcano, and the spider rolls. All of them lacked flavor without soy sauce. Maybe I'm spoiled by the sushi in Chicago but for how fancy this place looks I expected more.",

The drinks are okay but there is a pretty limited selection of cocktails. Everything is overly sweet. The sushi is good but ranges from somewhat to VERY overpriced, the Pad Thai was good but only had two scallops (which were admittedly perfectly cooked.)  There is a bar which you can sit both indoors/outdoors which looks enjoyable.  All in all, not bad, just not great.",

Social House is a very attractive environment with the fish tank floor upon entry. The waiter was very friendly and the best part, not annoying. Sometimes restaurants can go over board with the constant approaching the table. But he was very appropriate, but attentive and we enjoyed that. I had the Crispy Rock Shrimp and Salmon with Sushi Rice, it was very delicious but portions are quite small so be aware. It was enough for us, but not sure if It would be enough for others. For the drink, I enjoyed the Toji Mule. And endless sparkling water! My friend had the Sea Bass - and I did taste. It was very delicious. From a far at another table, I saw them serve from what it seems the Mongo Mongo Lamb Chops. I will try that next time.  It is a great place for a ladies night, date, or din din before a show. I look forward to coming back to try some of the other menu options.",

    "text": "First off - I am giving this two stars because j enjoyed two things - my drink and my sushi. I arrived before our reservation and had drinks and app at the bar. The Tojo mule is absolutely fantastic! And I enjoyed the dumplings and a pre dinner fare. I chose to have a farewell dinner for a friend of mine who is moving and I knew SH7 would be able to accommodate due to their lovely tables that transform for larger tables. After a few surprise guests, we ended up being a party of 10. For my meal, I ordered the spider and Godzilla rolls. Other guests ordered a mixture of things that we all tried. Chee chee Broccoli - bland. Pork Belly Skewers - too much fat than actual pork and yes I know I was tasting a pork style dish. Edamame and spicy edamame were both pretty good. My sushi rolls came out looking fantastic and tasted even better. We also accidentally received a ramen bowl - which I tasted - it tasted like the ingredients were not fresh.   What made me most disappointed about this was our cake. We brought a cake in and I called earlier and they said we can bring a cake but they charge a 3$ cutting fee. Perfectly fine. We get to the part of dinner where we wanted them to bring the cake out. They did and they plated the cake. A gentleman came over to make a big show of \"cutting the cake\". He plated the person of honors cake and then left. I thought that was strange but I assumed the cost was for purely cutting the cake.   What got me, was that there was a slightly larger table next to us celebrating a birthday and they brought a cake with candles out to sing happy birthday. Then I noticed a few minutes later that they came back from the kitchen with pieces of cake being served to the guest. Everyone in our party noticed that but we did not make a complaint since the bill had already been paid for.   The server we had was good. Prompt and itemized our checks without asking.   All in all, I find this place good for drinks and lunch time sushi. Come here for a large gathering if you want somewhere to accommodate a large party and your drink of habits but not necessarily your hunger.",

    "text": "Their sushi pricing doesn't make much sense. They had one single piece of nigiri priced the same as two pieces of sashimi -- if you eat sushi, you know that two pieces of sashimi is twice the amount of fish than the single piece of nigiri... typically you'd see two of either style at the same price point. In this case, I was didn't feel it'd be worth spending $5+ on one single piece of salmon nigiri unless something was truly remarkable about it. I quite sincerely and politely asked a question about the pricing, and the waitress was super rude about it, saying \"yeah I don't set the prices.\" Yes- I know that- I'm simply trying to source more information about the sushi quality... like, I dunno, was in flown in this morning from Japan or something that would justify what I am considering spending on nigiri? The fact that you can't or won't tell me why your nigiri is $5 for a single piece means this isn't the type of quality establishment that I'd buy $5 per piece nigiri from, so, your loss.  Anyway, that exchange just gave me an overall negative vibe. When my husband did decide to get some sashimi they neglected to bring any soy out, and I'd characterize my ramen as pretty shitty ramen. I'm easy to please with ramen, but the pork was like dry pork chop pieces in a super super salty broth that tasted more similar to Campbell's chicken noodle soup than to any ramen styles I've had in the past. The cocktails were overpriced, the dumplings were serviceable but nothing special. I'm a solid pass on this place for the future.",

The other 2 people at my table ordered rice dishes and had to wait an additional 40 min before they were served. It took the server 20 min to even realize they did not receive their meals because she was not attending to the table. Mind you, we were the 5th table to sit for lunch.  It was clear that our order had not been sent to the kitchen in the 1st place or that the kitchen lost our ticket because of the 20 min it took to get our food after alerting the server that our order was incomplete.  Things happen at restaurants out of the servers control (I know this from years of my serving) but the least the server could have done was acknowledged and/or rectify the situation. Neither of which were done. In fact it took an additional 15 min to ask if the rice was ok after the long wait. No comped food or even an apology for the inconvenience.  Our 1 hour lunch hour turned into an hour and a half at the restaurant most of which was unpleasant.  Only rating 2 stars because I enjoyed my sushi but the rice was definitely NOT worth the wait!!",

We had duck crepes and I'm not a fan of duck but the meat was so tender and had a really good smoke taste. We also had bacon wrapped quail eggs. Can't go wrong wrapping anything with bacon. And the price was really good. I had the godzilla sushi roll and my friend had the one with poprocks. The poprocks was interesting didn't add any extra flavor but popped in your mouth.

    "text": "Wow. I wish I had the pictures from the night we were here to add to this review.   PEEEYEEEEWWWWW  We went to try this place out as there would be Vegan options, it looked kind of upscale (so we dressed up) and was something new. I think it might have been a week night, summertime and the windows were open so a great space for people watching. The restaurant was nearly empty.   Walked in, 3 people standing at the door just stared blankly back at us and finally someone acknowledged us after about 2-3 minutes. They sat us by the window on a couple of stools.   No menus fro 5 minutes. No water, no one came to see us. Bear in mind the restaurant was EMPTY except for one party of about 6.   Finally, we had to get up and ask for a menu. 5 more minutes, still no one. We had to get up again and ask for a waiter.   When our waiter finally arrived (sorry to judge but this is a pricey restaurant) he was missing a lot of his teeth, the ones he did have were blackened and he smelled like smoke. I think he might have been from France...had a french-type accent. He was kind of aloof, took our drink orders and then 10 more minutes went by before we received drinks.   We placed our order for about 5 dishes...which he said would be \"more than enough\" for the two of us.   Let me make a long story short; LITERALLY 6 PIECES OF ASPARAGUS and 1 section of grapefruit for $12-15USD is NOT ok. This is not an organic restaurant...even then that would be robbery. It was slapped on a plate ( i do have this shot posted on my instagram) and just dumped in front of us with 0 care and attention.   3 shrivelled, dry, tasteless portobello mushroom caps stuck on bamboo skewers also do not command that same pricing.   This place is too big for it's britches and needs a reality check. If you're going to price your food to pay for your rent in an upscale location, you need to provide value for the cost. This place does not.   Two big, angry, ripped off thumbs down.",

I was optimistic in regard to the food quality and never considered the service would be sub-par. Beyond that I never expected FRAUDULENT CHARGES!! We were a party of three and our bill came to $73.64. Social House 7 adds a mandatory 20% to your bill and encourages more with an extra line for gratuity, making it easy to miss what's already been added on, if you're not paying attention. Before this even happened, our food came out at room temperature. The rice felt hard and like it was sitting under a heat lamp. The waitress told us all portions were large and shareable. In reality, they are about half of what you would get if you were at any other restaurant. That is of course unless you were at high end place with real chefs. The food was truly awful. The staff clueless. The management unapologetic and aloof. So my vigilance towards the check was aimed at not tipping. I was truly appalled they added a tip at 20%. I disputed it and crossed it out on the bill. I rewrote the amount on the bill of just the cost of the food. Upon checking my credit card bill a few days later I discovered they added the gratuity back on. A call was made and management said it would be credited back. Please know they may no attempt to keep our business or even apologize for our terrible experience. The credit was never made and when we called back, \"the manager\" said this was now harassment and they weren't crediting anything. Not only did he refuse to give me the corporate number, but actually said we were reported to the corporate office. I have never met such arrogance of any business. It is palpable when you walk in the door, with no quality of anything to justify any level of arrogance. I am confident the poor business practices and horrible food will eventually meet this terrible restaurant's end. For now please BUYER BEWARE!",

Ambience: The koi under the floor entering were not around, hopefully due freezing temps. The doors and windows let a pretty whispy draft through the bar area. The samurai metallic black and bamboo floors and decorations are fitting, and the restaurant has a individual feel to it.  I would recommend reserving a red booth for a party of 3-5ppl. They overlook the seating but your legs are exposed to those sitting at tables below... kind of a strange set up. However, I did not have a chance to see it at capacity in full-swing.  Food: I was here for lunch and had the Korean Cheesesteak and Poke Aloha roll. They both were great recommendations from the bartender. The cheesesteak had a spicy bbq sauce that was on point.   Drink: Good scotch on deck: Macallan 12 and 18yr, Laphroaig 10yr. Double cross vodka which is hard to find in Pittsburgh. Also a diverse selection of Japanese whiskey... again, hard to find.  Overall: Good food for lunch and friendly staff. Service isn't polished and it's cold inside when it's cold outside. Good spot for sushi on a weekend when sushi no. 1 is closed.",

    "text": "Came here for a date night before a show at the Benedum. I ordered sushi and asparagus and my husband ordered ramen and shishito peppers.   The ramen smelled weird and tasted weird. My husband was very disappointed and is now so turned off from ramen.   We were warned that the food would come out at different times because they have three different kitchens. I believe it was sushi, grill and regular kitchen.   My asparagus came out with the check. We had to ask for it and our waiter assured us it was coming. It was cold when it arrives and then our waiter just kind of ignored us for a while. Maybe out of embarrassment for the asparagus but we had to get to our show.  We mentioned our Benedum season tickets which should get us 15% off at Social House 7 and our waiter said we needed a coupon. Which is incorrect. There's no coupon.",

The food wasn't bad, it just wasn't good either. We got the shirt rib yaki noodles which were okay, the chicken with hidden dragon sauce (I think the only ingredient they used was salt), the corn robata which wasn't bad just very bland with no flavor and pork belly skewers which also had no taste unless you count the hair we found on it.  A waitress who wasn't ours also came around and spilled water all over the table and the short rib noodles. All of this for $84, which I wouldn't mind paying if it had been a good meal. Panda Express may have been a better option.",

There were four of us so we do sushi and shared a couple of \"entrees\".  The sushi was very good, thought flavors were nice and fresh.  The entrees were excellant except for the Ramen dish...rather bland.  The food was good...not the best...but the place is lively and unique for Pittsburgh.  I would return for the right event.",

The \"new style sashimi\" was $14 for 5 thin slices of cooked fish. No where on the menu does it say it's cooked, and nothing in the history of the universe suggests sashimi is cooked. To boot, the staff tried to charge me $28 for this ungodly abomination. That was quickly taken care of, but nothing else was done in a timely manner. I wouldn't even recommend this place for drinks as service was slow and inattentive at the bar.",

However, we were a little disappointed in the portion sizes of the food. Some things are over priced for what you get. We ordered the scallops first. Wow. It was hardly even half of one scallop that you got. The presentation was very pretty though. Based on that, we were just over it. Not sure if I'll give it another try.",

Ate here twice and sampled a ton of food off the menu. From the vegetarian sushi, to edamame, the broccoli appetizer and the soba noodle salad, I just wasn't that thrilled. Typically when I go for Japanese or sushi I'm thinking light, fresh and healthy. This is Asian food (all sorts) that's been heavily Americanized. Don't get me wrong, it tastes pretty good, but most things are deep fried or completely smothered in sauce. Nothing on the menu had that light, airy feel I am used to when I go for sushi. Even the vegetarian sushi roll came smothered in a white aioli type sauce that I don't believe is mentioned on the menu description. I recommend going to try out their unique cocktail menu and having dinner elsewhere unless you're prepared for something a bit heavier.",

The first time was on a Tuesday night where the waiter was rushing us although it was no where near closing time and half the tables in the restaurant were empty. The second time was on a Saturday night where we had a later reservation.We were seated on the bar side of the restaurant, which then turned into a club while we were still trying to eat dinner. I looked at the other side of the restaurant and there were plenty of open tables and the kitchen was still open. I understand needing to seat people in order to balance out the server's workload. However, after a certain time you should not sit people on the side that will then turn into a club atmosphere while they are still dining. I really enjoy the food but struggle with the idea of coming back and spending the money since we've receive below par service twice now.",

We had one waitress come over to explain the  concept and take our drink order but because the music was so loud I only caught a couple things she said.  We ordered drinks and then 2 more waitresses came over to take our orders.  There was definitely some confusion, but that's excusable because it was opening weekend.  My $18 Manhattan was a little weak.  We ordered the duck crepes, pork belly, pork dumplings, kobe wonton, yellowtail and tuna sashimi, spider roll, and salmon sashimi appetiizer.  The only dish that I would even consider ordering again is the duck crepes.  Everything else lacked flavor, the sushi was subpar at best.  I've had better at small local places.  Our salmon sashimi never came so I can't comment on that.  However the mango on top of the yellowtail just ruined the fish for me and we ordered tuna sashimi too and I don't know what came out but it definitely wasn't tuna.  There is potential here, however the food, while creative needs to be refined.  If we want sushi, we'll go to Umami.",
