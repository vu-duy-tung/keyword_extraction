Price: slightly more expensive than a typical breakfast diner, but well worth the cost of admission, the food is fantastic and they offer so many choices you won't be disappointed  Drinks: coffee is amazing, the smoothies are even better, and the coffee bar is great as well, plus try the homemade lemonade  Atmosphere: slightly cramped seating inside but only because there is always a line to be served because the place is so damn good, outside seating extends down the street and is more spaced and cozy, tables and chairs outside are very nice  Service: friendly and fast, always seated quickly even when there is a line, all meals come out together  (+): the location isn't great (see below) but it is right next to Dz Hot Dog Shop which is the best Six-Pack shop in Pittsburgh, the food is phenomenal, anyone who doesn't rate this as one of the top 10-15 restaurants in Pittsburgh hasn't been here  (-): location (who wants to go to Regent Square?)  Would I go back again? Absolutely",

I liked their coffee a lot, a latte that comes with proper foam is hard to find in a diner. For food, I had a brunch combo thing - sausage (that actually turned out to be a sausage patty but that's alright because I like those better anyway), eggs and potatoes. Unlike Pamela's, their breakfast combo doesn't come with pancakes, you can choose either eggs or pancakes. Sad but it's plenty of food.  The eggs were great and they have a nice selection of cheeses to scramble them with. Potatoes had a nice spicy flavor but were a little dry. I'm definitely adding Square to brunch rotation.",

    "text": "Oh, Square Cafe. I wanted to like you so badly. I've been meaning to come here for years. Then I moved to Chicago, and on subsequent visits to Pittsburgh never made it to Square Cafe. Recently, I saw a Groupon for this restaurant and decided to use it on my trip to Pittsburgh this weekend. I was looking forward to it; the menu looked great and the reviews were good. I went there yesterday, and my entire family was disappointed.  Service was okay -- not the most attentive in the world, but it was decent. The food, though, wasn't good. I had the lemon-berry ricotta pancakes, which weren't cooked all the way through. The middle in two of the three pancakes was uncooked batter. My mom said her hamburger tasted like a frozen patty from the grocery store and had a strange aftertaste. My dad's eggs were cold. And my brother, who will usually eat everything on his plate, ate less than half of his chorizo tostada. My brother and I took our meals in to-go boxes (I figured I could heat up the pancakes the next day and fix the problem of them not being cooked all the way through, but I tried to eat them this morning and they still tasted bad). My mom's burger was mostly uneaten, and to his credit the server asked if there was a problem. My mom said she didn't like it. Most restaurants would take it off the bill at that point, but Square Cafe didn't.  I'm giving it two stars because the restaurant is cute and the coffee is pretty good. I asked for a to-go cup for my leftover coffee, and the server actually brought me a to-go cup of fresh coffee, which was very nice of him. That was one of the few things that bumped this review up to two stars.  Also, it's expensive ($50 for four people before the Groupon). My dad said later that we could have gotten similar, better-tasting food for half the price somewhere else.",

It seemed to me that the cook didn't know how to cook tofu properly. It wouldn't have been so bad, but it was incredibly expensive for the portion and quality.  The waitstaff was very pleasant though, and the location is beautiful. A nice sidewalk cafe in Regent Square to catch some sun and people-watch throughout brunch. Plus, they sponsor a softball team in the Steel City Softball League. Last I heard, there was a new menu, so I'll definitely give it another shot and get some eggs next time.",

I have had the breakfast burrito and the veggie omelet, both of which were quite good. My friends got the pancakes, and thought they were delicious. The house coffee is very good, and there are also specialty/gourmet coffees (latte's, etc.), but I have never tried them. This place has an artistic flair, is clean, good service, and also has several tables on the sidewalk that are in the shade during the mornings - nice and cool in the summer. Also, if you are a vegetarian/vegan, this is a very good spot (and one of the few) to go in Pittsburgh, especially for breakfast.",

No flavor in the home fries, I mean how hard would it be to add salt and pepper or some kind of store bought seasoning. It was fairly busy but I'd call it a normal rush; however before I finished eating I was handed the check. I think they they probably are nice or friendly but I didn't experience it. A combination of so-so food and not great service make this the one and only time I will be visiting.",

I was torn between the Salmon Tartini (I think that's what it was called) and the choriza enchillada.  I'm pretty sure neither would be a miss, but I heard through the grapevine that their chef makes the chorizo.  Thus, I was directed that way.  It was a great tasting dish, perfect for my Sunday hangover.  I also had a peanut butter and banana protein shake which I sucked down like the Hoover Dam!  It was delicious.  If you like a little live entertainment, I'd suggest hanging out at the bar and observing the very friendly, outgoing staff (all good looking women as well, always a plus!).  Before I blew that hot dog stand, I grabbed a coffee to go.  I don't know what it was, but it was the perfect blend of smooth and bold.  I can't wait until next time to try out that Salmon!",

This morning I splurged on a $9 vegan breakfast burrito and here's what I have to say about it:    * Portion was huge. * Potatoes were nicely spiced and perfectly cooked. * Too much \"chorizo\" and not enough veggies or avocado in the burrito. * Chiorzo a bit heavy on the cumin making for a powdery spice mouth feel. * Salsa was not very flavorful, mostly tomato. * Not enough salsa to sufficiently moisten the burrito. * Salsa served in disposable ramekin. Needless waste. * Franks Red Hot, yes! * A fair attempt but definitely missing something. Roasted garlic and/or fresh cilantro could really set this thing off. Ooh, and pineapple!   Place was pleasantly bright with uplifting decor. Service was absolutely good. Interesting \"Choice\" of teas (Choice brand). I will probably try some sides a la carte next time.",

    "text": "Today was my first visit to the Square Cafe, and I'll absolutely return.   When my roommate and I arrived today, we were greeted to full tables (both inside and out) and a long queue of people waiting to be seated.  Although this looked like it would be at least an hour wait, we were told it would only be around 15 minutes.  Deciding not to wait for a table, a counter seat became available just minutes later, and we took those instead.  Although it was crowded, there was good flow in and out, so I don't doubt that the 15 minute estimate would have been close.  The food.... amazing choices here.  I'm vegetarian and my roommate is vegan, which poses an incredible challenge in Pittsburgh for no apparent reason.  The selections were clearly marked \"V\" for vegetarian and \"VE\" for vegan, although we were told that many of the V can be made VE quite easily.    As others have noted, the coffee here is fresh, bottomless and served in cool, square mugs.  No doubt, the squareness of the mugs adds to the taste.  I had the breakfast burrito with some added soy chorizo.  It came with sour cream and salsa.  Good vegetarian food is more than just a combination of plant-based ingredients.  When done right, it's truly amazing and makes you go, \"wow!\"  My breakfast was a home run!  Just the right size, and just the right combination of flavours.  My roommate had pancakes that were flavoured with pecans, cinnamon and other good things that reminded me of a big coffee cake-like-something that my mom always used to have around the house for company.  They were quite tasty as well, although I could never eat all that fluffy pancake mass by myself.  He could barely finish his meal.  After breakfast, I had a lemon bar (out of this world with just the right tartness and lemony goodness).  These are hidden on the counter, so  you need to look there when you go.  One of my biggest gripes with restaurants in Pittsburgh is the service which generally ranges from lackluster to downright awful.  Not here!  Sitting at the counter, we had the chance to talk to several of the folks that worked there.  The owner came over and introduced herself.  We didn't wait for anything (even the food, which came surprisingly fast for the crowd they had), but we were not pestered in search of a big tip either.  One important thing was apparent... everyone who works here really likes what they do and it shows.    Additional points to the staff for knowing that some of the ingredients in certain items were not vegan.  That's pretty rare, and often requires a trip to \"ask the chef.\"    I left here happy today and that's saying a lot for a first trip to a new place.  There's nothing I would have changed, but so many other things I want to try that I'll HAVE to go back!",

This makes it a little more expensive than most places you get bacon and eggs, but the food and service are solid.   Breakfast places are usually a greasy and comforting start to my day- bacon, eggs, toast, hash browns etc. Square Cafe has all these, but they get all their food as locally and organically as they can. The food tastes great, and the coffee is good, but be prepared to spend more here than you would at Denny's or Eat'n'Park, or Pam's. The bacon is thick cut and awesome, the eggs are done right and the coffee has caffeine.   The staff is great- attentive without hassling you and sitting outside is a great experience.",

    "text": "Since its inception in May of 2003, Square Cafe has enjoyed great success.  Located in the quaint neighborhood of Regent Square, residents are able to walk to the small restaurant and enjoy homemade food.  Arriving on a Saturday, we weren't surprised to see a large crowd.  During the weekend it's essential to come early if you're famished as you will most likely have to wait in line for a table after nine am.  Being unusually warm for the end of October, we opted for an outside table.  I ordered an omelet with goat cheese and tomatoes, and my girlfriend asked for the organic oatmeal with brown sugar and blueberries.  While we waited we sipped our coffee- a definite high-point for this establishment (supplied by Kiva Han).  With a robust flavor you won't be satisfied with just one cup.  While waiting for our meals to arrive we noticed several customers sitting outside with their dogs.  The owner, Sherree Goldstein actually encourages patrons to bring their pets, but outside only.  Our meals arrived promptly and were steaming hot.  The oatmeal was sizeable (bring your appetite!) and was packed with heaps of fresh brown sugar and fresh plump blueberries.  The oatmeal was cooked perfectly; lump-free and more importantly, not runny.  The omelet was fluffy and seasoned with just enough salt and pepper.  There was no scarcity of fresh tomatoes and goat cheese.  Other offerings from the Fall menu include the Vegan Breakfast Burrito ($9.00), Wild Mushroom Tart ($10.00) and Butternut Squash and Nutella Crepes ($9.50).  These are just a few items at the Square Cafe; the menu is quite extensive.  One of their most popular items on the menu are the pumpkin pancakes; loaded with fall spices and California Walnuts they're a wonderful treat.  Over the past few years sales at The Square Cafe have doubled.  Sherree Goldstein, the owner, attributes that to the high quality of food and repeat business.  \"People come here because it's convenient, and they like the family atmosphere,\" she says.  Sherree also explains that it's not important to take things too seriously, \"We're just flipping eggs here.\"  If you're a frequent customer of Square Cafe, you'll notice that most of the employees have been there for some time.  Ms Goldstein attributes that to the fun and simple atmosphere- one of her key employees, Donna Fey has been integral in helping to establish that.  The Square Cafe has also employed a new Chef, Doug Genovese, from the Pittsburgh Golf Club.  If you like breakfast foods and enjoy a jovial atmosphere, you'll enjoy your time at the Cafe.  Although it's not cheap, the quality and quantity of the food will leave you satisfied.

    "text": "Update 1st: I want to sincerely thank the management at Square Cafe, you responded to my review quickly and with concern. They also provided me with a gift card to try again which I look forward to doing in the near future. More updates to come!  Original: Too bougie to bear. That's my current take on the Square Cafe. When it comes to food, I don't mind spending money. But when you walk away having spent $40 for two fair breakfasts - well, that's TOO MUCH. Such was our experience on Saturday. We arrived around 11am and expected to wait. The wait wasn't too bad, and once we were seated at the bar, the service was fine though a bit snooty. I ordered an orange juice and breakfast burrito and Jonathan D. ordered the Pumpkin Pancakes with a side of sausage. The orange juice was small enough that I could've obliterated it in one gulp, and his sausage was so pathetic looking it was hilarious. The main courses were decent, but in this city of endless brunch possibilities, decent no longer cuts it. I think Square was once the bastion of brunch in an otherwise brunchless town, but has failed to keep up with the incredible offerings our city now enjoys. Sorry, but #overit.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to eat at Square Cafe for the longest time and last week I was able to get one of my friends to come with me to check it out.   When we arrived that morning it was busy; most of the tables were filled but there was no long waiting line. My friend and I liked all the bright, colorful paintings that were hanging all around the cafe. So far so good.  My friend ordered the special of the day, Turkey Devonshire, and I ordered the Omelet Ranchero. I was surprised by how quickly the food came out and I wondered, is the food any good? The food was actually better than good- it was amazingly delicious! I can't remember what was in my friend's Turkey Devonshire but he finished it in several minutes! The portions were more than adequate! I only ate half of my Omelet Ranchero because I had gotten full. My omelet had cheese and chunks of ham so I had a pretty high protein breakfast.  We had a great first experience at Square Cafe and I will definitely return soon with one of siblings.",

I'm glad before ordering it I asked the stranger next to me how he was enjoying his because he was right it did need a little bit more sauce. I ordered extra sauce and drizzled it over the crab cake and it was necessary. It also elevated it quite a bit. The first time I was here I had breakfast and a smoothie and it was delicious. This go around I decided to try their lattes. The Rocky Road one was okay. It wasn't sweet enough but I guess that's a matter of preference. I like my espresso to taste flavorful with a splash of coffee. The staff here are pretty awesome and accommodating as my friend who I was with was pretty demanding about her hash and the bread it came with. I'd definitely say this place is up there with Pamela's Diner it's just a bit pricier.",

The pancakes and the scramble were good but not particularly special.   We also ordered the oh snap! latte and the matcha peacha smoothie.

Everything uses simple but flavorful ingredients, with chocolaty to salty to savory.  The Tot Stuff is my favorite meal! The chorizo is also delicious.  They also offer a wide selection of specialty drinks from lattes to milkshakes.   The Staff:  No nonsense, quick, and they aim to please.  They always offer a coffee to go! Thy also let their staff practice a bit of autonomy in their dress/jewelry, which adds to the vibe.   The Ambience: Has the feel of a artsy, breakfast dinner.  The art in the walls is done by local artists and most is for sale! They also serve coffee out of really cool handmade coffee cups.",

Well, I was wrong. His meal came out just as quick and so did mines. However, his was cooked and mines not at all.   I ordered the Pumpkin pancake, and it was RAW! I waited nearly 10 minutes for a wait staff, and eventually went to seek one on my own to let them know.   They were truly kind about the matter, and quickly brought out a new one. Unfortunately that too was raw, pasty and flat. I didn't even bother putting it in my mouth. I showed the waiter, he too agreed that it was raw, apologized and took the $4 off my bill. Unfortunately that was it , so I left with a stomach filled with only coffee and a $17 and change tab to pay for waiting 30 minutes for a meal I could eat.",

I ordered the Veggie Benedict. The hash browns were way too salty, the veggies were undercooked and bland, there was so little hollandaise sauce on the eggs that I couldn't even taste it, and the side salad greens were underdressed. I wanted to ask for more sauce, at least, but the server never checked in until we were nearly finished.  My husband had the Pulled Bacon and Sprouts. He said it was ok but the bacon was dry and so were the side salad greens. His coffee was also just ok.  The menu at Square Cafe is interesting, but the execution is poor. I much prefer Kelly-O's in the strip district - there are fewer menu options but everything always tastes great. They also usually have a wait, but the line moves much faster and the servers are totally on top of things.",

Yep, that was it for the positives.  The cons: andouille sausage that was lukewarm with casing that was unchewable - not pleasant to have to dispose of that on the side of the plate...one taste was enough. Cheese grits devoid of any cheese flavor, but packed with hard lumps of uncooked grain - the largest of which was walnut-sized. The eggs were done well, but the entire dish was topped with a sweet jam that had no relationship to the dish whatsoever.   My dining companion had high hopes for her goat cheese, leek and pancetta frittata topped with greens. Yet another fail. She proclaimed it dry with very few of the fillings to be found...but TONS of greens on top.  Odd.  Maybe the regular cooks were off for the holiday. Maybe they were overwhelmed by the crowd...although truth be told, we didn't wait for a table even though it was packed. I wish I could have had the experience that all these four and five star reviews had,  but after my first try, it isn't worth going back again.

Allow me to explain.Two weeks ago I ordered one of their signatures dishes, pulled pork Benedict and it was just so so.The problem was with the pulled pork, which was generally tough and hard to chew.i don't know if it had been overcooked or reheated but it left me wondering if  the Square Cafe had started resting on its laurels as can happen with very popular restaurants . Based on today's meal I would say  the pulled pork was a one-time misfire . Square Cafe is redeemed in my book!",

My biggest complaint is really that it's terribly crowded.  It almost pains me when there's nothing really to make fun of, but from the food to the waitstaff to the decor, everything falls above the line at the very least.    Everybody goes there for breakfast, but they have delicious lunch options as well.  Well shit, I guess there's really nothing wrong with this delicious, well staffed, well managed restaurant.    But don't come here please, because it's difficult to find things to do in Regent Square when I have to wait for a table.  And that's how crimes happen...when you're waiting for brunch...first world problem.",

There was pretty good sized crowd the last time I went and there was a line around noon so it definitely does get packed.  I had their chicken and apple sausage omelet, which came with a side of home fries and toast (I chose rye).  My companion ordered their chicken and wild mushroom crepes and a side of fries (out of gluttony).  My omelet was alright; it was pretty standard and I've had better omelets before.  I typically like my home fries to be diced into larger pieces with a bit more of a char; they had a nice sprinkling of tasty seasoned salt though.  Also, I would've liked my bread toasted.  On the other hand, my companion's chicken and wild mushroom crepes were absolutely delicious.  The gooey creamy Gruyere cheese sauce brought the entire dish together.  It was topped with some diced tomatoes to add an acidic bite to the dish; I personally found this to be a questionable decision by the chef since the tomatoes contrasted so much from the rest of the dish and didn't really fit in altogether.  Her fries were fried crispy and well seasoned; I couldn't stop stealing them from her plate.  Overall Square Cafe is a nice brunch spot and I might go back once in a while, but I don't think it would be a permanent fixture in my brunch rotation.",

The place was packed and not once did the staff miss a water or coffee refill. I had the breakfast sandwich and I was extremely underwhelmed. I thought the presentation was incredibly sloppy and looked like it had been made by my two year old daughter. The bread was over buttered and under toasted and the sausage was falling out( only one small sausage link cut up in the entire sandwich). The cheese was 3/4 outside of the bread. There was no garnish or fruit are anything that came with it. For $9.50 I would have expected for it to be a little more filling. Perhaps a small side of hashbrowns or a little something extra should have been included. I left hungry. Props for excellent service but just ok food in my opinion.",

While I can't say that I've tried any of their other fare, their brunch is just so fabulous that I'm not sure I can come back for anything but. I've been here a few times (with a Groupon once - which they were kind and accommodating with) and ordered several different items and everything has been delicious. Highlights include their custom two-flavor milkshakes (I always choose peanut butter and banana - yum!), the breakfast sandwich with seisage, and the seasonal pancakes (both the lemon one I had in the summer as well as the pecan? or pumpkin? one i had in the fall were amazing). It seems they've mastered both the savory dishes as well as the sweet, which is a rare talent for a place that's fairly inexpensive. Boy, I get hungry just THINKING about Square Cafe!   The prices here in general are pretty standard for breakfast fare (about $10-15), so no complaints there. I love their efficient staff that always seem to know how to hustle and get the job done, despite the fact that it's Hangover Hour (aka any weekend before 1pm). I don't think I've ever had that awkward waiting time between finishing my meal and waiting for my check at Square Cafe. Only downside is that it's definitely not a calm and relaxing environment - people are always rushing about, but I find that somewhat energizing.  Also, every time I come here I want to get one of their mugs! I believe all the pottery and glass sold there is made by local artists, so I definitely support that. (Yelp Shops Local, right?!)",

We decided to try lunch this time, having had breakfast there a couple times before (which we always enjoyed, but found a bit overpriced for what you are getting). I tried the Square burger (to which I added Amish cheddar and bacon). WOW. Now I know where I can get a tasty burger around here. Delicious. So juicy, just the right amount of greasy, the Amish cheddar was nice and sharp and tangy, just the way I like it. Thick slices of bacon cooked crispy, the way it should always be. And their fries are great. Mike had, and much enjoyed, the chicken and leek crepes. We also got a vanilla milkshake which I must say was very satisfying, if not a tad bit pricey. All in all it was a great meal; I just wish they were open later!  And I hate to admit it, but the fact they their name is Square Cafe and their logo is a circle is, for some reason, incredibly irritating to me. I suppose I am too cynical to appreciate the irony...lol",

The menu is vast and has options to satisfy many food restrictions, both for breakfast and lunch. They offer vegetarian options as well as carnivore options. One of my favorite dishes is the French toast with the vegan compote. Tofu scramble is a really close second. Chocked full of earthy veggies and delicious flavors, it won't disappoint.   The venue itself is on the smaller side. During the warmer months, tables are set up outside and the available seating expands by close to double. In the winter, it can be tough to get a table inside. There is typically a wait but it's definitely worth it. The seating is a bit cramped, which is the only reason it doesn't get a full five stars. Parking can also be challenging in Regent Square, and side streets are your bet option.   If you're looking for a new place to try, I highly recommend!",

Four dollars extra for a croissant? You can get an expertly baked croissant at the French bakery down the street for less money than that. Literally. Square Cafe also doesn't participate in the widely accepted breakfast/brunch tradition of including a toast and potato option with one's entree of choice- instead requiring people pay an additional $6.25 ON TOP of a \"meal\" that is already setting you back $9-$15.  I think two tries is more than fair enough. I honestly prefer the Swissvale Eat n Park. Shrug.",

I ordered the square cafe breakfast which included 2 eggs, a protein, and either potatoes and toast or a pancake. I ordered it with the pancake and got a side of the potatoes because I really was ready to have it ALL!   The waitresses were both really nice and fast and the food came out fast too. The pancake was perfect, the scrambled eggs were nearly perfect (I am picky and like them softer rather than harder) and the potatoes were plenty.

The line builds up early on weekends so get there as soon as you can or you may find yourself waiting 30+ minutes (I once had to wait over an hour). However, I've frequented this restaurant many times while attending college in Pittsburgh and any potential wait time is definitely worth the wait. I'd recommend starting off with some coffee, served in their signature square mugs. Then, I typically get the veggie scramble with goat cheese as my entree. This is served with toast, a couple orange slices, and home fries. The legendary home fries are HANDS DOWN the main reason I've frequented Square Cafe so much. The potatoes are the perfect level of crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, with a nice seasoning of salt and pepper. I may even go as far to say I like these potatoes more than Pamela's potato hash... but you can be the judge of that on your next brunch here ;)",

The pancake special of the day was the Tiramisu pancakes and my god, I've never tasted a pancake as delicious as this. My friend and I still text about these pancakes about once a month. It breaks my heart that I will most likely never have the chance to have these life changing pancakes again. I hold out hope that one day, I'll be back in Pittsburgh and be able to have these delicious pancakes again.   That, or you can open up a store in Los Angeles that only serves these pancakes and I promise you, I will singlehandedly keep this store open.",

You just know this place has got to be worth waiting for!   Seating was cramped, but they we also very busy. Service was warm and never let our waters run out. They were quick with the check,  ever had us waiting after the first time!  :)  I ordered one plate of the protein breakfast, which was 3 eggs, choice of meat (I picked spicy sausage), and a cinnamon chocolate protein pancake.  Everything was delicious, perfect sized portions.  My partner ordered the BBQ pulled jackfruit/ fingerling potatoes/ mushroom scramble, and one SINGLE order of the PB&J pancake. The jackfruit is getting really popular as a pulled pork substitute in vegan cooking, so I was thrilled to see it here, being delicious!  My partner and I agreed the pancake could have been more peanut buttery, but we still loved it.",

Since we had a party of 14 & Square Cafe is a little small, the host and I figured splitting the group in half would be the best idea. It ended up working out perfectly because the entire party didn't show up right away, and the host was so kind enough to reserve a table next to our table despite the Cafe being busy and crowded! In the end, the entire family was able to enjoy brunch together!!   I wish I had taken pictures of our food because everything was amazing! I got the Brussels sprouts hash, & I would definitely order that again! My family was raving about the burgers, & the salmon omelette! Not to mention their coffee & breakfast food was delicious as well :) We had the best server, Steven, who was super friendly and patient with our family. He even gave us some of his chalk calendars that he made as a little souvenir! Go check them out if you're in the area!!",

I love to try to make healthier versions of my favorite foods and they seem to do that with some of their options as well. The atmosphere was really nice. Located on a somewhat busy street, the outdoor seating did not feel like it at all and the cozy tables made me nostalgic for the quaint cafes located on the streets of Paris. The staff was friendly and the place was bright and cheery.    My husband ordered the chorizo bowl and loved it. It's hard to go wrong with eggs, meat, cheese, and veggies on a bed of tots.    I ordered the pearly white omelet (which was more of a scramble but i don't care about titles). The pesto was such a nice touch and they let me swap the tomatoes for mushrooms with no problem. I'm a little hesitant when fruit cup is offered because it's never fresh but their fruit was so crisp and delicious. After much of my own experiments with protein pancakes, i know that they can be pretty dense but they kept a good amount of fluff and the chocolate chips were a nice touch! I love that they offer a single pancake because i never like to get the pancakes for my meal because it's always just a bit too much for me in terms of sweet and since food is my love language, i love to try as many things on the menu as possible.   If you're in Pittsburgh, this place is definitely worth it.",

I enjoy how they change the menu with what is seasonal, although I'm always sad when I fall in love with a dish and then it's gone... ;). The reason I went with 4 stars is because as one of my dining partners today said, \"Square Cafe is really amazing 1 out of every 4 times,\" and, honestly, I would agree with her. Sometimes the dinning experience is straight up Mary Poppins (practically perfect in every way), and sometimes it's just good. Though square Cafe's \"just good\" is already way above the curve in comparison to other spots in town, even when it's not at it's best. You should go; it's definitely worth a stop - even though I regret adding to the lines... :)",

Well, thankfully, good friends quickly introduced us to Square Cafe.  I highly recommend trying their specials. My first time dining here, I tried the pineapple pancakes topped with burnt almonds. They were delicious (though sadly a couple of the pancakes were raw in the center). The fruit crepes - which are always on the menu -  are also amazing. I was expecting the crepes to be heavy, especially since I ordered them with Nutella, but they were filled with fruit and seemed very light, dare I say, even healthy.  I've also been very impressed with the restaurant's staff. They're helpful and friendly. We've been seated very promptly (even on busy Saturday mornings) and received our food quickly.  This is a great, must-try breakfast/brunch spot!",

My two tips for the folks at Square Cafe are: 1) Get the NoWait app service! and 2) Open another location!   The only reason I don't go to Square Cafe more often is that I know I'm going to have to wait for a long time and then be packed in and I know that the wait will be done through an antiquated system of waiting. I would go even more often if there were another location maybe in Shadyside/East Liberty area, since there's a lack of brunch spots there!   Pleeeeease open a new location - everyone loves you!

    "text": "Despite hearing good things about Square, I hadn't made the trek there in the many years I've lived in the East End. Along with a group of coworkers, we decided to pay a visit on a weekday morning for brunch, excited for an opportunity to do so on a rare free weekday. As mentioned by other reviewers, the ambiance is lovely, though it is (like many similarly billed brunch spots in the area) on the smaller side. We came in expecting a wait for our large group, but what I didn't expect was the annoyance that we encountered by more than one staff member regarding our group's size. When we first went to place our names in our a table for 10, our host responded with a sarcasm-laden \"Great.\" before she eventually told us that she would do the best she could to seat us in a timely manner (which, to her credit, she did). Our waitress was similarly annoyed while taking our drink orders as we all had squeezed into our little corner of the room, though she had relaxed by the time we went to order our entrees. I should mention, however, that we had a woman who appeared to be a manager stop by our tables to check in at a few points during the meal, which I appreciated.  As for the food itself, I got the Square Special, which is your standard eggs-meat-carbs brunch combo. I was easily able to substitute one of the specialty hotcakes (orange cranberry) for the standard buttermilk pancake, for a surcharge ($1.75, I think). Though my three pieces of bacon were thick-cut and cooked to a perfectly delicious crispy/chewy perfection, the rest of my meal was lackluster. My pancake was dry, as were my scrambled eggs (i.e. in the style of the powdered stuff). One friend got the Tot Stuff, of which I sampled a tot which was deliciously salty.   Overall, I was sadly underwhelmed by Square Cafe. Like other reviewers, I felt that while the price point wasn't dissimilar from other brunch spots in the area, the quality of my meal didn't match up to what I ended up paying. Additionally, though our waitress did a good job with our large group, the annoyance that accompanied our visit was disappointing. I absolutely understand that having such a large group in such a small space is difficult, but despite our offer to split into smaller groups in order to facilitate seating, we were faced with bad attitudes by more than one member of the staff. Of note--I, at least, wasn't aware until we got the check that they would not accept more than two credit cards per table (which, in the era of transaction fees and Venmo, is understandable for the merchant and workable for the customer). I don't anticipate that I will be returning to Square anytime soon.",

Most recently, my boyfriend and I were here for brunch on Saturday.  We had about a 30 minute wait (y'all know my feelings about waiting for food, but it wasn't that bad) and were eventually seated in a larger booth with another two-some at the opposite end.  It would have been nice to be asked if this seating arrangement was okay, but I would have agreed regardless so I guess that's a moot point.  Anyway..  I ordered the Brussels Sprout Hash and he got the Cornmeal Pancakes (with a side of bacon - can't be THAT healthy ALL the time).  The hash was delicious.  It was served over cheesy grits and had sauteed Brussels sprouts, mushrooms, and pancetta.  The grits weren't so cheesy that I couldn't actually taste the grits and the veggies were cooked so there was still some snap to them - perfect.  I just wish the Brussels sprouts were smaller and more flavorful.  These were the big honkin' ones that don't taste like much.  I hit a wall with a few forkfuls of grits left but I still managed to eat some pancakes.  They were delicious - hearty, flavorful, a little gritty (in a nice textural way), and surprisingly fluffy.  Also are gluten-free.  The coffee is good and served in thick mugs.  The servers are friendly and efficient.  The bacon vanilla shake will be mine next time.",

The service was good, we always had coffee and water. I got the Hopple Popple, which was really delicious. The cheese was on point, and the eggs, potatoes, peppers, ham and onions were really well seasoned. My boyfriend got the basic breakfast, and the homefries were really good -- and a tad bit spicy, which was great. I'd totally come here again!",

However, for my cafe choices, I did venture out and tried a different espresso drink each time. The raspberry has to be my absolute favorite, its sweet and loaded with caffeine.. JUST PERFECT.  The seating can be difficult since all three times we've came here that its always packed. We choose to sit at the bar stools just so we didn't have to wait too long. As we were eating, many people would come in, look at the crowd, and leave because they decided not to wait. To those people, i say NAY! Wait the 15-30 mins for a table, the food is absolutely worth it!",

As the reigning Pancake Queen (how did I get this title? I made it up!) I decided that I would do myself an injustice for not eating pancakes here.  Let me tell you, I was NOT disappointed.  Not in the least!  The Oatmeal Pancakes with peach compote, pecans, powdered sugar and whipped cream was just divine!  I've never had oatmeal pancakes and I think I'm in love!  They were incredible and since they're made with oats I'm just going to go ahead and say they were healthy (they probably weren't, oops).    We also decided to split the Omelet Ranchero.  It was packed with loads of cheesy flavor and a nice helping of salsa on top.  Served with potato's and we were in carb overload!  I almost wish we would have ordered a side of fruit instead of the wheat bread it came with just to redeem the meal into being slightly nutritional.  Whatever though, it was darn good!  The ambiance with bright walls, polka dots and fun modern artwork just matched the bright and cheery attitude of the wait staff.  It made me happy and most importantly, my tummy happy!",

We were sat right away at a nice sidewalk table.   We brought champagne, so were greeted with a pitcher of oj for mimosas. It was great, just way more oj than we needed (I am a \"heavy on the champagne\" type of mimosa drinker). It wasn't a big deal at all, I just felt bad for wasting.  The meals were both perfect. I ordered a vegan tofu scramble, that was served with plenty of roasted veggies and mixed greens. BF got the salmon crepes, and he was in love.

I couldn't take more than a few bites. I had some rye toast to tide me over. Tim had the special - Short Rib Benedict - a brioche bun topped with short rib, an egg, and hollandaise sauce. OH MY.

But even once my initial hunger was satiated, it was delicious.I mean, really crazy delicious. I got chicken crepes with mushrooms and I could have eaten a second...not because they are small, but because they are the type of excellent food that encourages me to overeat. My brother got salad and pancakes (he's weird like that) his wife also got the crepes and I think he felt left out. They were that good.   Super adorable interior and friendly service. And reasonable prices.  When I think of places I'd like to live if I move back to PA, Regent Square comes right to the top of the list and I have to give the square some kudos for factoring the neighborhood into consideration :)",

    "text": "I love this place and have visited frequently to try their different menus. The Square Cafe has a seasonal rotating menu that uses mostly local seasonal ingredients. It is only open for breakfast and lunch, closing daily at 3pm. They have an awesome coffee bar with great specialty drinks, but no alcohol. Bloody Mary and Mimosa-seekers must go elsewhere.   This place is very accommodating for different dietary needs like vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free. Menu items that accommodate special dietary needs are clearly labeled, and many dishes can altered to fit your diet. I'm a pescatarian (vegetarian + seafood)  and while this place has absolutely delicious smoked salmon incorporated into most seasonal menus, I usually order vegetarian because the options are so numerous and interesting. They always have great scramble options mixed up with delicious fresh vegetables and cheese, and dishes usually come with a side of toast or mixed greens. The mixed greens don't really thrill me, so I usually substitute rye toast with no issues.   My favorite item on the menu is the nutella crepes with carmelized apples. My boyfriend and I split an order of these every time we come here. The crepes are perfectly cooked and extra thin, and the apples just blow me away. Make sure you order CARMELIZED apples though. Once I forgot that crucial qualifier and ended up with raw apples (even though this is not an option on the menu). They were not nearly as good--not even close--but I ate them and didn't say anything since it was really my fault for ordering wrong.   My only complaint with the square cafe is the prices keep creeping up every season. What started off as a place where dishes range from $8-$12 has quickly crept up in price to a place that ranges from $10-$15. Every season when they add a new menu, the prices go up ever-so-slightly. For a place that is only open for breakfast and lunch and doesn't serve alcohol, these increases are a little annoying and I have been going here less and less often. I hope the prices stabilize a bit so I can continue to frequent this place, but I'm fast-approaching the tipping point. I want to give this place 4--heck, even 5--stars, but the constant price increases are a huge problem for me.",

Regarding the price of food, I did think that it could have been cheaper; however, I did feel satisfied by the food/drinks that were ordered even though it was around $40 for two people. The prime factor that runs up the tab is definitely the drinks (milkshakes are about $5 each, which is a tad expensive...they are very good though!).  Overall, I think everyone should give the Square Cafe a try--it's hard to go wrong here folks! (By the way, if it's nice out, SIT OUTSIDE! It's great!)",

I asked if we could have plain buttered pasta for our son and she asked in the kitchen and said no special requests. I then asked if they had any raw veggies or plain fruit and she said no. My chickpea sandwich was good but my mixed greens weren't edible. The lettuce was wilted and brown, who ever made up my plate obviously didn't care about the quality of the food.

Definitely want to come back here.

I had the Veggie Scramble, made up of fingerlings, squash, parsnips, and carrots and topped with an over-easy egg. It wasn't super flavorful on its own, but with a little added salt and pepper and a dash of ketchup, it was delicious.   The coffee, which isn't great but also isn't terrible, is served up in an adorable square mug that really encompasses what this place is about. It's cute and quirky, but you know you're going to get a good meal. Can't wait to go back",

I've gotten the Lox of Love before, and I have to say that the combination of the ingredients they put in made me a very happy customer. I also had their lavender green tea, which was heavenly and something I'd absolutely recommend.  One thing to note is that there is normally around a half hour wait for brunch on weekends, so definitely go early.",

    "text": "Square is one of my absolute favorite breakfast/brunch spots in the East End. I absolutely love the square coffee mugs, and I think the coffee tastes even better just because of these adorable mugs.   The atmosphere is cute, almost diner-esque, and they have an adorable litte bar when you can sit and order their signature lattes and a full breakfast/brunch/lunch if you like. They have a variety of table sizes considering the small size of the restaurant, and I have come here in groups of two, four, and six. There is plenty of room if you come early on a weekend morning.  I generally order their scramble special, as my favorite Hopple Popple is not on the menu year-round. They always have delicious things that they mix into scrambles on special such as avocado, house-made chorizo, brussel sprouts, etc. The veggie omelette is delicious as well, and my sister loves adding goat cheese to it to make it creamier and even more delicious.  I love coming to Square with my sisters when they come to visit. It's kind of our thing, and everyone loves it, even my picky eater sister. Though I'm not a sweet-in-the-morning person, my sister swears that the pancakes are out of this world.   The signature lattes/chais are great, and the barista can adjust any of them to your preference. It's always fun to try new things at Square! Plus, because their ingredients are so fresh, you don't leave feeling sick and stuffed.",

My friend and I shared the breakfast burrito and cinnamon roll pancakes. The breakfast burrito was excellent as the tortilla was seasoned with spices, which really made a difference. The burrito was filled with eggs, mushrooms, cheese, onions and came with sour cream and salsa. The cinamon roll pancakes were beautifully presented as they had a swirl pattern and drizzled with a cream cheese frosting. They also tasted amazing as well. The prices are very reasonable, too. A great place to grab brunch!",

    "text": "I was so excited about this place. The reviews seemed great and it had great vibes. We went on a Sunday and waited 30-40 minutes for a table. That's fine, seeing as we went at peak brunch hour. But once we say down we were pretty hungry. The first thing I noticed was that my spoon was dirty and had something white stuck to it. We wanted to order right away but after bringing us drink orders, our waiter left quickly and ignored our attempts to flag him down. We watched him take the order of the table next to us before managing to flag him down. We then waited for about 50 minutes for our 3 entrees to come out. The table next to us who put in their order right before us recieved and finished their food. During this time, our waiter was no where in sight. Our bottomless coffees and waters were not refilled. When we finally saw him again, we asked where our food was and he abruptly left again. He finally came back with our food without an explanation or apology for why we had been at this restaurant for almost 2 hours (counting the wait for the table and food) with only drinks. The food itself was fine. Definitely not worth the wait. For the price, I thought the portion was a little small. I got the chorizo scramble. The meat was good but the egg was dark and overcooked. My boyfriend had the meat mania scramble and he said that it had more green pepper than meat which was disappointing. My friend enjoyed her vegetable wrap. All in all, I don't think this place lived up to the hype - especially if you have things to do after brunch.",

Now let's talk about the food, delicious, prepared well, not greasy, and of quality. Scrumptious and fufiling!

We were looking for a place close to both of us that wasn't a chain - I finally remembered Square Cafe and was so glad I did!  While it was a Friday at breakfast time (8:30a) we were easily able to get an inside table.  Unfortunately it was a little too chilly to take advantage of the outside tables.  But I very much look forward to taking advantage of them soon!  Our waitress was awesome, the food was amazing.  The best part - they didn't mind that we sat there for a bit longer to chat.  My friend got a coffee - they even offered her a cup of it to go!  Anyways - get to Square Cafe.  It is SO good, so fun, and so worth it.",

The coffee options are great ranging for a diner as they offer more than just normal drip coffee. You can also get a coffee to take with you! The place can get a bit crowded at times so best to go during non peak or prepare for a wait. My last visit I got two eggs over medium (done well) to go along with breakfast meat and toast. The ambiance is family friendly and good for groups. The only part lacking is that it is a bit expensive for what you get.",

When I arrived I was told to have a seat at one of the small tables.   I was having a hard time deciding whether or not to go for breakfast or lunch but then decided to do sort of a mix. I ordered the chicken crepes with mushrooms and Asiago cheese. I learned that they promote other small businesses in some of their menu offerings and the cheese on my crepes was homemade. I got my food fairly quickly. Although I couldn't see the crepes for the cheese it was so good!! They have some new offerings on their spring menu including some vegetarian choices.   I was chatting at the next table with someone who had ordered the chicken salad in paninis. It came with French Fries. He told me it was delicious! The place wasn't overly crowded when I arrived and I saw they have two gender neutral bathrooms.  Expect to pay anywhere over $10.00 for your meal but when I compare it against some of the chain restaurants that  charge the same amount you get more bang for your buck here. The food is indeed filling but in case you have room then they serve milkshakes and smoothies. Kids' meals are a flat $6.50. They also do catering here.  Also along their walls they put up various artwork which is for sale. Online ordering is also available. Some of the local vendors they promote are Emerald Valley artisans, King's pearl cheese, and Nancy B's bakery. One final note which is most often overlooked on the menu. There is a sharing fee of $2.50. Please be aware of that when ordering. I am anxious to return sometime in the future to try out their breakfasts. I was told the Brussels sprouts hash is what they are noted for.",

Actually this would be a great place to break up with someone... very public.  There are a ton of vegetarian options including jackfruit, Brussels sprout hash, and soy sausage. I like the pancakes best. You can get any pancake as a single if you want to try a few or can't eat a stack.  Also, their espresso beverages and milkshakes are amazing! You should splurge on them if you can.",

    "text": "Square cafe is one of our favorite spots in the East End. It's an upbeat, clean, refreshing looking diner, with new takes on your grandaddy's style diner.   We don't get a chance to come here as often as we'd like as they are usually extremely busy and we don't normally have the time to wait too long. But today we had a Groupon(look to see if it's still available: $50 voucher for $32) and we had nothing else to do this morning.   We tried the ahi tuna bowl and a classic favorite of mine the breakfast burrito along with a couple specialty coffees.   The vibe here is so nice and friendly, it's such an enjoyable meal Everytime we come. Check it out while the Groupon is available!",

The first time I came I think I ordered one of their pancakes... but I came a second time today and ordered their Square Breakfast. I asked for scrambled eggs, breakfast sausage and a buttermilk pancake. Unlike other breakfast places, the food here isn't too greasy and heavy. Everything tastes clean and fresh. I would get their tiramisu shake if you can!   There's also outdoor seating which is really nice when the Pittsburgh weather clears up. I understand that when it gets busy, the service goes down a bit but both times that I've come, the service wasn't the best.",

I was here with my friend for brunch on memorial day. We had to wait for 20 minutes to get seated. Their menu includes variety of breakfast and lunch items, so we killed the 20 minutes to decide on our order.  We ordered the Brussels sprout hash and the day's special french toast. I was intrigued by the variety of latte flavors they offer and went for the coconut flavored coffee (Smoconut if I remember the name correctly). The coffee is so refreshing and wonderful start to my day. My friend who does not like coffee stole a few sips from my cup! Do try their coffee in the special mugs they have!   The hash is packed with natural vegetable flavors of Brussels sprout, mushroom and caramelized onion served on a bed of creamy grits. I did not even think of seasoning with salt and pepper. You cant stop eating with that rich flowing egg yolk. The grits are creamy, soft and cooked to perfection. French toast is good, regular taste that you get at any good breakfast place.   We will definitely visit again, but next time, we will order the unique items they offer like the hash which I don't get at other brunch places.",

Fast service, great pricing, and they bring out the ketchup and hot-sauce immediately after you ask for it.  Seriously, what more in life could you want?  The restaurant is bright and inviting.  Decor is nice, but the only thing that bothers me about this place is the fact that there are circle prints on the walls.  Doesn't seem fitting, right?  Whatever.

On my most recent visit, I rode my bike over from Shadyside, and instead of getting a food coma like I normally do after brunch, I was feeling great afterwards since my meal was not overloaded with grease like many brunch options. I tried the Smoked Salmon Omelet and also got to sample the Veggie Overload Omelet with mozzarella. Both were great! I also recommend the specialty lattes - they are delicious, especially the Snickerdoodle!  The atmosphere is cozy and very cute which its own unique flair. It is very popular for breakfast and lunch (so get there early on the weekends if you don't want to wait), but I can see how it would also be a great to come midday to study or read.

But for locals it's the only offering,  so I go.  Let me reiterate that the food is consistently good, so I don't mind paying a little more for a good bite.  The filet and sweet potato mash is by far the best thing on the menu for the price,  On the down side pancakes and crepes are generally a la carte, no side of any kind is served with them.. I find that annoying.     The atmosphere is my biggest problem with this place.  The dining room is very small and the foot traffic is a nightmare.  This might be really good new$ for the owners, but it is off putting for those who want a relaxing breakfast.  The seating is not handled with as much grace and poise as I have seen at other busy restraunts manage this blessing of a problem.  Loads of people are crammed into the doorway, there is not a designated waiting area.  You either feel like you are making others uncomfortable by placing your rear in their face as they eat their breakfast OR you are on the recieving end of that discomfort, it's a lose lose.  I am a young 20 something year old, but I have come to Square Cafe with senior relatives, it is certaintly not accomodating to their needs in terms of space or seating.     I would like to give a 2.5 star, which is earned solely by the consistently good food, however a half marking is not possible.  2 is too low, as you will most likely enjoy what is going into your mouth.",

    "text": "This is a hard review to write. I will start off with the fact that we're from Cleveland, so we only get to come to the Square Cafe a few times a year, but we have included it as our Sunday morning breakfast spot each time, so about 6 times in the past year. I've seen some changes in the food quality during that time, but maybe the past 3 times we've gone have just been off days for the cooks? I don't know. The previous visits, I could not say enough about the food, which is why we haven't given up on them. Our visit this past Sunday may have us trying out some new places on our next trip though. My boyfriend ordered the succotash hash, no egg since he tries to stay vegan as much as possible. I ordered the vegetable crepes. Our food came out, his hash was topped with eggs, we just scooted them off and he was left with a very small dish of Lima beans and corn with a few other vegetables mixed in. My crepes vegetables were barely heated. Raw onion is not appetizing at all. We left there and asked why?!? What happened to the place we visited a few months ago when we had yummy breakfast dishes and couldn't stop recommending it to friends?!  I think maybe we'll take a break for a bit and then try them again, so we're not going to break up with them just yet.",

He previously recommended the Brussel Sprout dish that I adored (and inhaled).    With the new Spring menu,  he suggested the Tot Mess - tater tots with vegan chilli,  peppers, egg, etc.  Matt did it again - I LOVED my breakfast!  It's truly the perfect bite if you enjoy a savory breakfast.  Chilli and tots AND eggs?  Yes, please!   My only recommendation would be to select a runny egg (over easy,  poached,  or sunny) instead of scrambled.  The yolk mixing with the chilli and tots would make this breakfast irresistible!   Thank you again to our server,  Matt, for a great time and meal.  I cannot wait to go back and try another Matt suggested meal :)",

There was a small wait time and it was crowded. So we opted to head straight for two empty seats at the counter. No wait time and quick service! They had outside sidewalk seating, normally I would have preferred to eat outside, but I was STARVING!  Besides being super cute and popular, the food is very good. They have a lot of healthier options, which I found refreshing. Also, they offer some really great typical items (like the breakfast burritos and pancakes). They have lattes, smoothies, and milkshakes as well. I ordered the Chorizo Benedict for my meal and I couldn't pass on trying a latte. They have the coolest mugs! Check out how they stack them next to all the coffee making machines at the counter... very cool.  I already know I'm coming back here, soon.",

We figured the food must be good with such a long line and almost left thinking the wait would be too long. The host told us the wait would be about 20 minutes and he was almost exact in his timing. So glad we waited!!   The place itself is very bright and cheery. Very colorful, interesting and locally sourced artwork. I knew I was in the right place when I saw the staff wearing T-shirts that said \"Love Each Other\" with unicorns and rainbow artwork.   Now on the the food - First of all it came out extraordinarily fast, cooked to perfection and prepared just the way I asked. I had eggs, homefries & Italian Chicken Sausage (which was amazing). For the table we shared the Lemon Blueberry Ricotta Pancakes, which were out of this world and the Brussel Sprout bowl which was superb!   Everything was amazing and the staff was excellent. Also, they serve a bottomless cup of Joe for $2.80 AND they will give you a to-go cup, which was greatly appreciated as we were making the long drive back to the Philadelphia area after brunch.  If you are looking for a delicious, reasonably priced meal in a beautiful, warm and accepting space, Square Cafe is your place. Can't wait to go back!",

Though I really wanted to go for the lemon berry ricotta pancakes, I knew I had a long day ahead of me and decided to go for the more robust waffle biscuits and Brussel sprouts scramble. My companions had a salad and chickpea burger with sweet potato fries.   Our food came quickly which was awesome. My scramble was two biscuits in waffle form with a Brussel sprout and carrot hash topped with pulled bacon, scrambled eggs and asiago cheese. A little salad was served on the side   The biscuits especially were awesome and very dense. The pulled bacon was tasty but a bit on the salty side. The eggs were perfectly scrambled and the Asiago was an awesome touch. The meal was PLENTY of food for the price and I wasn't able to finish about 1/4 of the dish. Probably wouldn't reheat well so I didn't bother taking it home but I totally would get it again. Everyone else enjoyed their meal and felt the portions were plentiful as well.   Service was good, my coffee mug never got chilled or even close to empty. Coffee was tasty. I'll be back -- especially to try the pancakes!",

I dry heave just thinking about it. Bacon not cooked very well the fat squishy and I opted for a pancake instead of home fries also just mediocre. I hate to be so harsh but that was my experience with the food the most upsetting part was for this \"meal\" I paid $10 bucks. Hubby did like his $12 dollar breakfast burrito, his only complant was that the actual burrito was bigger than items inside of it. It is also one of thoose places that krams you in like sardines.

I had their home fries, breakfast chicken quesadilla and the walnut pumpkin pancake. The pancake was amazing - not overly sweet but delicious and satisfying. The quesdilla could have used a little more cheese and hence was a little dry but it was quite hearty. My BF thought the home fries were the best he had ever had, I thought they were good too ;) I thought it was a great deal with the groupon savings.  The second time I went without a groupon and paid full price. This time it seemed a little pricey. I got the mint hot chocolate which was very yummy, but it wasn't nearly as hot as it should have been. I went more classic with the breakfast sandwich which was fine enough, but was a little disappointed that not of the entrees really came with home fries, which is usually standard at breakfast and brunch places. Together the rather basic sandwich, small bowl of cold home fries and hot chocolate was $20+. It was good, but I probably won't go again without a deal or groupon.  Waits on the weekends are quite long and its very busy. The second time we went on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving around 10 AM and were seated at the last empty table at the time.",

The place was packed, but the hostess was extremely professional and efficient in getting everyone seated in a timely manner.  It took only 15-20 minutes on a Sunday morning for us to get to our table. We had the corn beef bene, which was absolutely delicious. It was big chunks of corn beef over rye with braised leaks and poached eggs. It was a very unique spin on eggs Benedict and was perfectly balanced.  We also gluten free pancakes, which I was a bit skeptical of. I have tried many gluten free items before (bread, bagels, muffins) and have always been disappointed. However, these pancakes were by far the best gluten free items I've ever eaten (that classically should contain gluten). They had an amazing texture, which is incredibly hard to do without the use of flour.  I love the classic Pittsburgh spots (Pams, Deluca's), but this place is far better than both.",

I also got a side of fruit, which was OK, although the grapes might have been a little moldy. The coffee was great though.   Gf's breakfast burrito (not vegan) apparently was pretty bland, and because of the limited options, I can't give it 5 stars.   Still, for vegans, this is still one of the best places to go.

Nice selection of breakfast items from your sweet to savory and for reasonable prices though I feel like they have changed the menu recently so that there are less items. Anyway I don't get the name of the cafe but there are shapes (not just squares) painted on the ceiling in bold colors with local art work hanging so it is a comfortable atmosphere.   The service has been good - coffee is always filled (cups that the coffee come in are shaped interestingly cool) and the waitresses check in at reasonable times with a smile on their face. They are there to get you in and out with a full belly due to the volume of customers.  I've eaten quite a few of their scrambles and omlettes along with their home fries and toast. The combinations of the flavors work well and homefries don't need any additional seasoning unless ketchup. Pancakes are fluffy and sweet, love how there is a dallop of whipped butter and whip cream. I have yet to have the french toast but my boyfriend always orders them with strawberries.  This is a staple breakfast place for us.",

    "text": "You should know up front that I have a special attachment to the Square Cafe. I grew up in Regent Square, so I've been rooting for its success from the very beginning. Boy, am I happy to tell you that this place just Keeps Getting Better.  The crowds of people waiting to get a seat (sidewalk cafe al fresco style if it's warm) should not deter you. The staff is efficient, so get close to your neighbors in the teeny waiting area and just enjoy the local flavor. The good stuff is on its way sooner than you think!  I love that the walls are decorated with local artwork for sale, and the atmosphere just makes me happy. Very bright, clean and retro-modern.   Breakfast/Brunch: A resounding yes. Anything I've had has been delicious. While the menu has changed slightly over the years, I can recommend the side of potatoes (perfectly bite sized, crispy and salty) the tofu scramble that even meat eaters will enjoy and the breakfast burrito (ole!). Meals usually come with a slide of toasted ciabatta. Do yourself a favor and forget your no-carb diet, add a healthy smear of jelly, and ENJOY.  Lunch: I get the same thing every time for lunch, just because it's so good: chicken salad on a wrap with lettuce and tomato, with a side of fries. I almost don't want to write about it, because it will make me HUNGRY. I always promise myself that the next time I'll try something else, because it all looks so good, but I can't cant give up an opportunity for this sandwich. It's creamy and crunchy in all the right places, and the fries will knock your socks off. (The sweet potato fries leave something to be desired, however. Stick with the regular.)",

We stopped on a weekday around lunch to avoid the rush, and had a Groupon in hand. No issue at all using it, like some small businesses. My husband had a breakfast quesadilla of some sort that was fantastic. The tortilla was freshly made, eggs were light and fluffy and the sausage was perfectly seasoned. I'm a big breakfast fan. I had the hazelnut pancakes. They were good. But not as good as my husband's dish. There was plenty of seating inside and out. We finished brunch with a fresh smoothie, which was light and not sickeningly sweet. Can't wait to go back again!",

A $9 breakfast sandwich I could make at home and doesn't even come with homefries.  A $2.50 charge to share a plate.  Super long lines.  The home fries seem like they are frozen.  The breakfast egg rolls are delicious but the brussel spout salad was literally spoiled and we had to send it back after some doubt from the server.  Super expensive coffee.  The service is generally good however we once waited more than 20 minutes with a crying toddler for someone to take our payment.  The people are very friendly and they are kind to kiddos, and the sidewalk seating is great.  However, generally overpriced and overhyped with a feeling they are always trying to squeeze the consumer.  A request on the menu to pay cash since it's a \"small business\" however the food is marked up unbelievably.  The quality has gone down significantly since it opened.  Take your money instead to Coco Cafe or Moulin in Shadyside.",

When we arrived around 1PM, they quoted an hour long wait for a group of 5 and it only ended up being a 30-minute wait, which was good news.  Atmosphere and service were awesome and the menu was very vegetarian friendly which was perfect for the group I was with.  I really can't say enough about the service.  They were very attentive, and we were seated outside where I often think service can be a little slower and less attentive.    I ordered the oatmeal pancakes with the peach compote and was a little disappointed based on previous reviews.  Ridiculous, I know, but they were too much like dessert for me and there just wasn't enough oatmeal in the pancakes.  Having said that, they were tasty just not what I had anticipated.  I also sampled the tomato bisque and pesto and fresh mozzarella grilled cheese.  Both were good but just didn't live up to my high expectations.  Still, one of the better brunches in Pittsburgh and I'll go back again to try something else from the menu.",

Unfortunately, my experience here did not live up to those expectations. My meal was good and my guests enjoyed their meal as well. The staff was friendly and helpful. Perhaps some of my disappointment is with the menu which is what I would classify as too avant-garde for what I was looking for this particular morning. At breakfast, I prefer the traditional favorites, while this menu focuses on some really experimental flavors. For me, I would find this place more enjoyable at lunch rather than dinner.",

I went with a big group of my boyfriend's friends on New Year's Day after a night of partying, and they were open!  Everyone's food looked delicious.

I usually get their breakfast menu options because the few lunch options I have tried are the reason I can't give a full five stars. In my opinion the lunch options just don't match the tastes offered on the breakfast menu and aren't really inspired cooking. I will recommend trying their specials and it is good to remember that you can order their sweet specials as a half order to share since they are almost always too sweet to eat a full serving alone. The coffee and free Wi Fi is pretty nice too.  Sometimes the servers at the tables can be a little flakey, but you will also find really attentive servers too so I feel like you can't hold it against the whole staff when one of the servers is having an off day. The main thing about all of the staff is that they feel like real people, and you will never once confuse them for an automated restaurant-o-bot who just goes through the motions.",

The food is good and so is the service. When I take my 13 month old with me the staff are always friendly and accommodating (they will often bring some banana slices for him to munch on..no charge)  There are so many yummy choices on the menu it is often hard for me to decide. If I feel like eggs and something more savory I usually get the veggie overload omelet with feta cheese. It is so good and full of lots of veggies not just onions and green peppers...which I find at a lot of other restaurants. If I feel like something sweet I get the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes, light and almost crepe-like compared to the standard buttermilk. The food is fresh and satisfying, not extremely greasy or salty, more like how you would cook at home.  My only cons are that the seating can be tight when the restaurant gets crowded..especially on weekends. The tables are so close along the bench seating it can be hard to squeeze between them to get to the bench (and I am on the slim side) Also, the menu changes a bit with the season, so if you find favorites you might be sad to find them off the menu at times.",

The menu has a variety of breakfast and lunch dishes, with extensive availability of vegan and vegetarian dishes. Not to worry, there are items for meat eaters as well.  We tried two of the bowls, one vegan made with Jackfruit which was delicious.  The other bowl was a vegetarian dish intended to be served over oatmeal but our server suggested to have the fixings served over cheese grits.  Yum.

I appreciate their inventive and delicious items, one of my favorites is their Brussel sprout and bacon over cheesy grits bowl. Mm mmm! They have different specials every time and there is always a wait it seems. Their waitlist is kept by hand by the host so you have to show up to get on it. But worth the wait! In the warm months their outdoor patio is great to dine on as well.",

Had the ricotta pancakes, which were not as tender as ones we've had elsewhere. Also ordered the ancient grain bowl, which was not bad, although I had to remove about 1/3 of the avocado which was brown.",

Parking however is non existent in the crowded streets and neighborhood.  I would definitely go back again, how often depends on how much I would want to deal with that area of Pittsburgh again.

I had the delicious caprese scramble with amazing gluten free toast (from a local GF bakery), served with fresh green salad.  And my daughter had the gluten free pancakes which were so good you have to ask if they are gluten free.   Instead of berry compote they happily substituted fresh blueberries.  And wow - the fools gold drink was so tasty.  And they were able to make it with almond milk.  Our waitress Heather was friendly, attentive and so helpful.   She helped us chose the pancakes and fools gold based upon our dietary needs",

The only downside to Square Cafe is how confined it is. There's always a wait, which is no big deal, but it's very packed once you do get seated.   Their menu is filled with so many different options - sandwiches, breakfast bowls, crepes, vegan options - everything!!  It's well-priced. Nothing too expensive. Worth every penny though no matter what you order.   Love coming here and would absolutely recommend it to a friend!",

I thought the only way to get eggs like that was if I cooked them myself!  This bowl had quinoa as the base and was filled with grilled veggies including zucchini, mushrooms, peppers, broccoli and cauliflower. I can't wait to replicate this at home. It was so delicious!  I had the special Brussels sprout has, grits, and one egg overt easy. Delicious! Perfect! Our server was friendly and efficient. He kept our coffee filled and checked back after our food arrived to see if we needed anything. The check was delivered promptly. Another friend had the lemon ricotta pancakes and noted how light, airy and delicious they were.  Another friend the shorty rib crepe which she seemed to enjoy. We sat outside as it was a beautiful day. Will definitely check this place out again despite being a long ways from home!",

    "text": "** Extremely crowded / popular on weekends with waits around 45 minutes. Solid lemon berry ricotta pancakes but possibly lacking on savory foods... Wish there were more options that gave you both.   I came here after church for brunch on a Sunday, so naturally this place was packed. We were told the wait was around 25 min but maybe ended up being closer to 45. Since it's so busy, it definitely feels very crowded and people are rushing around and squeezing by each other just to get around. So if you are looking for a more chill place where you can sit for longer and relax, maybe this isn't the place.  I am typically more of a sweet breakfast person (although I usually like a combination of both) so I ordered the lemon berry ricotta cakes ($11, 3 pancakes). There was a very unique and subtle hint of lemon that really complimented the sweetness of the pancake, which was nice and moist. A light drizzle of syrup and I was digging in.  Though the first pancake was amazing, I do have to say that eating three of them definitely grows on you. I was also eyeing the square breakfast which has 2 eggs, a breakfast meat, and pancake since it gives a lot of variety which is what I like best. The only reason I didn't get it was I wanted to order something more unique considering I waited for so long, but it looked great from what I saw when other people ordered it.   My friends all got savory options such as the ranchero omlette which they didn't seem to think was anything special... Can't comment on it because I didn't have it but maybe they need to step up their savory game.",

I'm a sucker for anything pumpkin, so when I saw pumpkin praline latte on the menu I lost it (in a good way!) I was trying to be healthy, so I just got the yogurt bowl, but it was still one of the best yogurt(s?) I've had in a restaurant. It's plain greek yogurt, so I just asked for some honey. The granola won me over! My boyfriend got an omelette - don't remember which one, but he liked it as well. It may not be the cheapest place, but it's worth it for some tasty food! I came back and tried the french toast which was also good. They had switched to their spring menu, so pumpkin options were gone :( I had the salty chai latte iced, and it was SO good. Great combo of chai tea flavor and espresso. Highly recommend!",

I ordered the 'Square Breakfast' which is 2 eggs any way, choice of meat, and either a buttermilk pancake or home fries with toast. I ordered my eggs scrambled, with ham as the meat, with a pancake. They bring out ONE undercooked, sunny-side up egg, bacon, and the pancake. The server was gone before I could question my order, so I ate it anyway, since I was starving. It wasn't until I got home that I realized I only got one egg instead of the two promised on the menu, and 2/3 items were incorrect. For 9.50$, I was expecting way better service and at least the proper type and amount of items I paid for. I feel pretty cheated. Sadly disappointed.",

I also think the menus were their new fall menus as well. But they were nice about it, and I got the actual vegan fig pancakes instead. It was an inconvenience and they need to fix it.

Also, they do not split checks.  And you can only use two forms of payment per table.  So if you want to split it more ways than two, bring cash.  They didn't warn us until we checked out.",

    "text": "This is one of those reviews where I really wish yelp would allow us to give half stars. I would like to rate Square Cafe a 3.5, because there have been a few disappointments for me. I know a few people who LOVE Square Cafe, but I've been there at least 10 times and have only been \"wowed\" once (ordered Nutella crepes with strawberries on the recommendation of the server). Every other time was just \"good.\" Not great, not terrible, not \"meh,\" but a place you would go to if you were in Regent Square area and wanted a decent breakfast.  Okay, let me just break it down as clearly as possible: PROS:  1. Crepes (most breakfast items actually) 2.Vegetarian options/healthy options 3. Milkshakes 4. Unlimited coffee in really cool ceramic mugs 5. Decor and cleanliness 6. Service (Usually really good, besides the time I brought my mom who was moderately impatient and you could tell the server wasn't having any of that.... which is somewhat understandable.)  CONS:  1. Chickpea sandwich/burger thing- It was dry and tasteless and kind of looked like canned catfood. This is actually the lunch I ordered that made me stop going to Square regularly.  2. Breakfast potatoes- They are also dry and boring, and definitely not worth the calories. I don't know how so many people enjoy them.  3. The wait time- Prepare to wait at least 20 minutes for a table for two most weekend days. If you're a table of 3+, you could probably be asked to wait 45 minutes or more. You'll also probably be outside, or squashed into their tiny entryway that was definitely not meant for patrons to be waiting for their tables.  Overall, check it out. You'll probably like it. Don't order that sandwich.",

    "text": "Having been to Square a few times now (4 I believe), I think it's safe to say this has quickly become one of my go-to's for breakfast in the Burgh. With a fun, quirky atmosphere, friendly waitstaff, and straight-forward fixings, you really can't go wrong starting your morning off at Square.  ATMOSPHERE - 4/5 Polka dots, festive hues of red; green; blue; and orange, abstract flower art hanging on the walls, and funky/retro diner seating. In a word, Fun. Square is about sharing laughs and good times over a scrumptious meal, nothing of the decor of the place would lead one to think otherwise.  DRINKS - 5/5 With a beverage menu nearly as big as their actual food menu, you may need to ask for another minute when your waiter/waitress comes to take your drink order. My 2 cents, you can't go wrong with anything from their specialty latte menu? I've tried nearly everyone and enjoyed all so far. (Pro tip: if you want it to come in the special Square cup, you'll have to order a 12 oz)  FOOD - 4/5 Serving up modern twists on classic diner breakfast dishes, Square's locally sourced, beautifully garnished plates do not disappoint any hungry patron. I recommend their Pumpkin walnut pancakes or Monte Cristo if you're feeling a sweet tooth, otherwise their breakfast sandwich or one of their hashes will do you good. I'll be avoiding their breakfast burrito as my last one was, well, bland, and there are plenty of better sounding options to try next!  Bonus points for their unique idea of giving warm, fuzzy, blue blankets to patrons who sit outside on chilly mornings, was a nice little touch that I won't soon forget.",

I asked our server if this was a change in the item but he said it was just a mistake on their part. I knew they were busy so I knew it was an insignificant problem, but our server returned our bill taking off the tot mess because of the small hiccup. I genuinely appreciate this small act of kindness. Having a business care about their customers like this will undoubtedly make me want to return. Thanks Square Cafe!",

The interior is adorable, and its always busy, whether it is on a weekday morning at 8 AM or the weekend brunch crowd. Their coffee, something usually overlooked at these sorts of places, is awesome. So much better than what you get at Pamela's or Deluca's. And the food, OMG. Their Lemon Ricotta Pancakes are absolutely amazing. They are so different than anything that I have ever had. I crave them. Their cinnamon bun pancakes are also great.  One thing I LOVE about Square Cafe is that you can order individual pancakes so you can mix and match to get a breakfast instead of ordering one full order.  If you are in Pittsburgh for breakfast, you really should go. It is a treat!",

There's a chalkboard people draw on in the bathroom too, which is not super special or anything, I know, but it's the little things that make cafes like this fun.   There's a nice coffee bar to sit at if you're by yourself too.   I had the short rib omelette which was very good. The coffee is good too and they come in these cute \"square\" mugs.   Seating is indoor and outdoor, but if you're sitting outside there are some awkward moments when people are parallel parking next to you. Otherwise, it's fine.   As with any brunch place in a trendy neighborhood, be prepared for a wait on weekends! On weekdays, seating is plentiful, and they open early.",

    "text": "Square Cafe is a great concept: the menu was full of items made from fresh ingredients with unique combinations. The restaurant had a colorful decor and lively patrons. However, I was not super impressed with my brunch, I felt that something was always missing from my food.  One of the pros of the place was that all the food items had a home-style feel while being unique, which I liked. I got the breakfast burrito: chorizo, eggs, and veggies all wrapped up in a flour tortilla. Coming from Southern California, I was expecting one of those famous Mexican-inspired breakfast burritos you can find in tons of mom-and-pop restaurants, full of meat, cheese, etc. However, what I got was mostly eggs and a sprinkling of the other stuff, aka an omelet wrapped in a tortilla. In summary, the overpowering egg was under seasoned and lacked the Mexican spices I grew up loving. For the price, I did not feel that I got what I paid for.  We also got the Cinnabon-inspired pancake. This was amazing. It tasted like a cinnamon roll.  In terms of the service. I understand it was a busy day, but the lady who was taking people's names in line was extremely rude to my girlfriend. She (girlfriend) accidentally stood in the doorway and apologized after she was asked to move. Even after apologizing, she received an eye roll and scoff. I realize that should not influence the rating too much, but it really set the dining experience to an off-note. I prefer not to start my meals being angry.  My experience was not the greatest. Perhaps I ordered the wrong thing. I would love to give this place another shot because it has such great reviews and the menu items sound so promising.",

I PM'd Square on FB and asked to create my own meal. They said no problem but then I got there and looked at the menu and said I am having what I want and I will just be responsible to stay within my calorie limits for the day. I had the Latke Lox. Incredible!!!!  It is a potato pancake topped with smoked salmon, sliced tomato and two eggs then sprinkled with red onion, capers and more tomato. I kept my hollandaise on the side so I could control this delectable sauce.  This is my new favorite. I say this after almost every meal here. And life it too short not to have a Stormy Chai. So silky smooth and tasty. I only had a small. I miss my usual 20 oz but 12oz is better than 0. Now I enter everything I eat into MyFitnessPal. I needed to know how many ounces of salmon I had so I asked. I briefly explained that I was logging all my calories and greatly appreciated her help. She asked if I wanted to see all the ingredients from my Chai so I could accurately add it to my diary. How thoughtful of her. She did not have to do that but that is how Square employees roll. They go above and beyond every day for their customers. And let's not forget that they told me the day before I could create my own breakfast which for the record was going to be half an English muffin topped with sauteed spinach, smoked salmon and one egg. Hollandaise on the side and topped with diced red onions and tomatoes. How many restaurants will agree to that?  If you have not ever been to Square Cafe you must go. Don't miss this Pittsburgh gem.",

While waiting outside some guy pulled up and asked me why the long wait.  I showed him the menu. on our 8/18/14 visit, i had corned beef hash and eggs.  Whatever image you have of this in your head is wrong.  We are talking chunks of salty lean corned beef, mushrooms and shallots lightly sauteed in sweet butter with tiny potato halves.  All of this sits under two perfected pan cooked over easy eggs.  Add some perfect rye toast and a stunning pottery mug (I bought two) of coffee and you have an unique breakfast for less than what you'ld pay at Dennys.  It is my must visit any time i come to Pgh.",

Forgot to ask how long it would take but we figured we'd chance it and run across the street to check out the beer case at D's. We left just in time as when we got back to Square Cafe the woman came outside and called our name.  After looking over the menu the dining partner ordered the Square Breakfast with over easy eggs, chicken apple sausage, home fries and ciabatta. I ordered the spinach pancetta omelet. I was delicious stuffed with feta cheese. We liked Square Cafe because it was something different and special for a nice brunch.

    "text": "\"There was a little girl and she had a little curl right in the middle of her forehead. And when she was good she was very good indeed, and when she was bad she was horrid.\" This rhyme from my childhood always comes to mind when I think about Square Cafe. I've had wonderful food there, and I've had stuff that should never have been brought to a table.   I was there the first few years, and the food was awesome. Then it was terrible. Then the former partner (Sheree?) returned and took over the business and the quality went up - but over the next 12 months it dropped off again. At some point they hired a new chef (don't know her name but her beau was working the coffee bar) and everything was very good (Johnny Cakes were awesome) but apparently she's gone now too. They took my favorites off the menu (including Green Eggs and Ham, temporarily, because they said they couldn't make it in the winter - WTF? Basil grows in a flowerpot, man!) and started making blueberry pancakes with frozen blueberries. Who puts frozen blueberries in $11 pancakes?   When I moved to Regent Square 6 years ago I went 2-3 times a month, and I usually got an egg sandwich on ciabatta. Every time it was different. Sometimes it was dripping oil (I swear some cooks buttered the ciabatta and some didn't). Sometimes it was joy on a plate. Sometimes the bacon was hard as leather. Once when I got pancakes instead, I paid the extra $2.50 or whatever for banana and received a plate with 3 banana slices on it. No kidding. That's $0.83 per slice.  In spring 2010 I went for a weekday lunch with some friends. They got breakfast food, which seemed fine, but I ordered yogurt with granola. What I got was a dish of plain yogurt with about one tablespoon of oatmeal sprinkled on top. And for some reason it tasted like onion. This \"yogurt with granola\" was $8!   The coffee has always been good, as far as I can tell. But a friend of mine once noticed that he had been charged two different prices for his coffee on two consecutive days. Apparently the coffee with refills - even if you're never offered one or accept it - is $2.80 but if you don't get a refill it's $2.19? That's just weird.   Bottom line: Food quality is a crapshoot, but it's _always_ expensive. And that's just not worth the 2-block walk from my house.",

The food was incredible - I had the Square Protein breakfast with a Trail Mix pancake on the side - and the coffee was excellent as well. We had to wait around 20 minutes to get a table, but it was 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday, so a wait for good food is to be expected.  The ingredients are organic, the food is prepared well, and the presentation and service is excellent. You get what you pay for, and in this case, you get quality food. Then again, I don't mind paying for high quality items and service. The bottom line is that good food costs money.  I very much enjoyed the coffee and saw nothing wrong with it. Most people are used to drinking rotgut coffee, so perhaps the coffee at Square Cafe is just something foreign to them. It all depends on what you like I guess.  I will most definitely be back here for breakfast and lunch.",

If anyone is from the Pacific Northwest, you will feel a little bit closer to home when you see all the lumberjack types with beards and non-traditional families (and traditional ones) that fill the small restaurant. I don't know how they can have such a large menu when the dining area is so small. It's definitely worth the wait, though.   They have interesting and delicious ingredient combinations. The miss-matched dishes are cute, everyone is jammed in and having a great time and great food. The pumpkin walnut pancakes are delicious and so are the veggie omelets. Really, it all looked pretty amazing. Like I said, can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I use to live up the street from this place and was there on one of the first days it opened. I was pretty excited to find out that it was two women running the cafe and so excited that I could walk up the street to get breakfast on the weekends. Before this place opened you really had no where else to go for breakfast in Regent Square except across the street to the coffee shop.   My friends and I started to frequent the Square and found the wait was long, the service sometimes off  (unless our friend would wait on us) and to me the food was a bit over priced. But I kept hoping they would get some of this stuff together and thinking they just needed a couple more months and it will work out. Then I moved away.  Four years later, they still don't have it together! I was visiting Pittsburgh and met up with my friend  here. The line was out the door and when my friend went in to ask if we had to put our name in or what the deal was no one knew! Then we see 4 people come in and just jump right in front of us. After 15 minutes we saw no one around to take names or anything. You are suppose to put your name somewhere? But no one really knew! It was like we needed a secret password to just get in the door. If we guessed right perhaps we could get a seat?   It was so disorganized and reminded me of when they first opened. Perhaps its better to go during the week but seriously, how hard it is to have someone take people's name and greet them? The menu still seemed a bit over priced just for some basic items. We ended up going somewhere else.",

As I currently live in the Baltimore-Washington area, I thought the prices were reasonable and appreciated the breakfast menu moving beyond eggs and pancakes and other generic \"Eat and Park\" kinds of food (not that there is anything wrong with that). I had polenta cakes, sauteed butternut squash, and caramelized pears with a side of chicken sausage. Pretty good stuff! I thought the coffee was pretty good too for drip coffee, despite what some of the other reviewers have mentioned. We liked William our server, Bonnie the owner and the rest of the friendly staff who were very welcoming to a couple of out of towners. Thanks for a good meal before we hit the turnpike.",

On the show the restaurant looked great, the staff was excellent, it was family friendly and the food looked great, so I was looking forward to trying The Square Restaurant.    In reality the space is fine, the staff is great, it is very family friendly but the food isn't worth the hype.  We were greeted by a welcoming staff member and told where to sit.  Our waitress was  friendly and was at our table within a few minutes, if that.  I ordered  the Square Breakfast with coffee and orange juice and DH ordered  shrimp and grits with coffee.  Are beverages were brought to us, again, within minutes.  The coffee was served in big square mugs,  hot and had body  The orange juice was disappointing but the menu does not state it is fresh squeezed.  We received our selections within ten minutes.  My over easy eggs were medium well, the homefries were deep fried 1/2 inch potato squares, the ciabatta bread was very lightly toasted, not having any browning and the soy sausage consisted of two very dry sad 2 inch round patties.  My husband's grits were well cooked although not as creamy and buttery as they should have been with the shrimp unseasoned and to the side. This is  unlike the traditional dish when they are seasoned and served on top of buttery grits.  He was happy with the taste but they were not up to the standard shrimp and grits we've had in North Carolina for many years.    I'm very willing to pay the price for a good meal but in this case the meal price was far to high for what we were served.  The staff is friendly, the restaurant is very family friendly, the space is over the top noisy, at times making it difficult to have a conversation.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant unless you have young children and don't care that much about the food quality.  It's too bad as the staff is great and should be serving much better food for the service they give.",

My friend had the salmon crepes, which had smoked salmon, light cheese, herbs and oven-roasted tomatoes. This dish was outrageously tasty and if you're in the mood for a salmon brunch dish, I would highly recommend it. The pieces of salmon on top were a bit dry but, eaten with the sauce, it was delicious. The homefries were serviceable but plain - no onion, peppers, or discernible seasoning.

However, if you modify your order a bit, you can make it much better. Order it with two eggs, potatoes (home fries), ham, extra salsa, and ask for some hot sauce. Too bad this isn't the default!  The coffee here is pretty good, and comes with free refills. Make sure to tell them you don't want cream if you don't plan to use it, otherwise they'll bring out a huge cup of it and it'll just go to waste.  Big plus: they use NoWait, so you can add yourself to the wait list before you even arrive for Sunday brunch. If you don't use NoWait, plan to wait for thirty to forty five minutes! Breakfast on weekdays is much more manageable and you can basically just walk in and sit down. They open early which is a plus!  PS: the pancakes are pretty good here too.",

    "text": "So I used to think Coca Cafe was the greatest brunch that ever there was. However, I am delighted to be proven wrong by Square Cafe. First time there (on a Sunday) our wait was less than 20 minutes, which I'd call pretty good for Pittsburgh. Our waiter set us up immediately with coffee.  Let me just say - I am SHOCKED by how wonderful, and well-thought-out their menu is. As in, I cannot wait to go back and try every single item. I ordered the chicken and mushroom crepe, and it was perfect. My friend (from New Mexico) got the southwestern hash and had only the highest praise. My gluten free husband got an egg dish, and a side of gluten free fig pancakes, and rhapsodized about them.  Square has unique (nonalcoholic) coffee mixed drinks! They have crepes, eggs, benedicts, pancakes, TONS of vegan and gluten free options.  Honestly, do yourself a favor and get yourself there! So worth a trip!",

This isn't greasy diner breakfast food. It's art. Vegetarian? Vegan? Gluten-free? No problem, so is most of their menu. Daily specials often tempt you away from your original choices. Stand outs for me are the asparagus and goat cheese scramble (my stomach growled as I typed this), the square breakfast which I can get with soy chorizo(!), the breakfast burrito with homemade salsa, and don't even get me started on those pancakes. What a truly special restaurant. Only negative for me is location, I'd prefer not to get on the Parkway if I'm jonseing for breakfast.   Wait in line. It's worth it!",

    "text": "I love brunch.  As far as I'm concerned, if you're a brunch place, you're already starting ahead.  But I love weird brunch and my husband is more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy.  Enter Square Cafe, which has become our go to brunch place because I can get a tofu scramble and he can get all the meat and potatoes that his fat heart desires!  Square Cafe, as some have noted, is in a fairly small space, and gets crowded on weekends.  That being said, in the 10 or so times I've been here, I've never had to wait more than 30 minutes for a table.  Their specialty lattes and milkshakes are not to be missed.  I've dinged them one star for the food, which is typically quite good, but I've had a couple \"misses\" from their menu (as excited as I get for gluten free pancakes, these are not the best, fairly dry and leathery).  There are plenty of VERY good menu items, and they do rotate seasonally.  Right now, I'm all about the Cold Weather Crepes, which are full of Gruyere and butternut squash, or the brussel sprout hash, served over some gooey-amazing cheese grits.  Finally, as busy as they get, I've never had anything other than good service here, and typically it's excellent.  Every so often, the coffee bar gets backed up and you might get your food before that delicious fancy latte that you ordered.  That's not a big deal to me at all. If Maddie is your waitress, you'll be in great hands!",

If we were 20 minutes later I think we would have been waiting a while-which also helps with a positive review.  The place had a very friendly atmosphere, we had seats at the bar which kept things lively and ensured we had great service.  Husband is s coffee drinker and he had positive things to say. I think he also liked the square mug it came in (well....maybe that was more me than him-super fun and they sell them onsite).  He had the burrito, it was really quite good (but not outstanding for any particular reason). I had the eggs Benedict and they were quite delicious - would get them again. Also the menu is quite extensive-many options for all palettes.   We ended with a crepe with Nutella and bananas-great ending to a great meal!",

Green eggs with Ham has a very unique taste which both my boyfriend and I favor!  Their coffee is more than tasty which actually surprised us. Plus, bathroom is clean.  I will suggest to buy their groupon first and go with the coupon.  We bought the option of $13 for $20 value and we will probably go again.   Better go a little early since it's very popular and the line is long.  Wait was 20 mins for us three - we got there before ten and it was pouring !!  By the time we were out of it, the line got even longer. So better go early !!  Serve is nice :P",

Ive been wanting to try this place, but Bobby is not much of a brunch person so it's not very often we venture out before 4pm for a meal on the weekends.  We should have just sat outside and I would have given 5 stars if we would have, but we sat inside.  I have to deduct one star from my rating because although we were there not long before they were closing, the floors were absolutely filthy: dirt, footprints, used napkins, straw papers and food. All over.  I know they are busy throughout the day and might wait to sweep until it dies down, but there was literally so much crap around me I almost asked to be moved outdoors to eat.  There was only one other table seated inside besides us. It didn't bother Bobby though, so I sucked it up and we ordered our food that was nothing short of amazing.  I ordered the Tot mess with the vegetarian chili, scrambled eggs, sour cream and cheese all over tater tots.  It was a huge serving and it was everything I've ever hoped and dreamed of. Bobby ordered the Cinnabon pancakes....................... and they were even more amazing than they sound.  Our waitress was super friendly and took good care of us.  I ordered a Mallownut (toasted marshmallow and coconut!) latte on our way out and it was very good and very sweet.  Just how I like it.  I got the thumbs up to make a second, third and fourth visit to try some other things on their menu in the future so hopefully we will be back in time before it's too cold and we can eat outside on the adorable patio!",

    "text": "This is a nice little spot for a morning or afternoon bite. I had bought  groupon earlier that week and decided to take go on a sunny friday afternoon. It's really busy on Saturday and Sundays so I try to go during the weekdays.   My hubby called off on friday so I was lucky enough that he could join me. We arrived shortly before 2, found  a parking spot right in front. Lucky us! i was wearing my sweats and felt a little under dressed but i didn't let that bother me. My money is as green as the next persons. We walked into a onslaught of bright and bubbly colors. Oranges, blues, greens and my favorite color red. We walked to the bar where a barista greeted us and asked which seat we'd prefer to sit in. I liked the high back seats at the bar so we choose to sit there. The bar itself help a  lovely grey top that kind of neutralized all the bright colors and gave it a really retro feel.  When our menu came i ordered the veggie omelette and my hubby ordered the omelette that comes with fingerling potatoes and some greens. My omelette was ok, nothing special but i could definitely taste all the fresh veggies but i guess the omelette had no salt or was cooked in cooking spray because it lacked that good egg flavor that only butter or oil can bring out. My hubbys omelette on the other hand was very good. Those fingerling potatoes tasted sooooo good. They were soft and perfectly cooked and blended into the omelette. My side dish was ciabatta bread and home fries and he ordered extra wheat toast with his greens(salad). I was sad about my potatoes because they came out cold and lacked that crispy crunch you enjoy when they are fresh. His salad was really good and came with a homemade lemon and oil dressing which i loved. Lemon is a flavor my taste buds cannot resist.  After finishing our meals we noticed a list of espresso with some really interesting combinations. We settled on the unicorn which comes with lavender and vanilla. All i can say is mmh mmmh mmmmmmhhhh!! I'm not much of a coffee drinker but this drink tasted more like a hot chocolate than coffee. I enjoyed how smooth it was  and the barista lauren who waited on us divulged that she came up with the menu. I was very happy that she was the one who not only created my drink but served it up as well. The service was great, the atmosphere was really comfortable, I do however wish that my potatoes were fresher.",

The jackfruit was extremely salty to the point that it was inedible. It came with some kale and other misc veggies so there was no real base to offset all the salt. I also ordered the protein pancake that tasted like cardboard. I definitely regretted not going with a regular pancake.  Our waitress was so sweet and friendly, but naturally with so many people to manage, we felt neglected most of the time. It took forever to get served because the kitchen was backed up. Our table was squeezed next to another couple, so trying to have a conversation with another one going on 5 inches away was quite uncomfortable. If I ever come back, it's going to be for take-out.",

Pretty much anything you might want for brunch or lunch you can find here, and at a very reasonable price. The cafe is located in the Regent Square neighborhood right next to Frick Park.  Their menu is also very vegetarian friendly. My Mom got the chickpea and beat burger which was delicious and had a fun purple beet color. I got The Brussels sprouts bowl which was very flavorful and had an egg on top. Someone else got the granola and Greek yogurt bowl which was great for a light bunch.  All in all this is a fun cafe that will leave you satisfied and feeling pretty healthy about what you are! Quick and friendly service in my opinion as well.",

The service was pretty good and despite how busy the place was, food came out rather quickly. I had the Square Breakfast which was fine, good if you want an assortment of things. Someone had the Nutella Crepes which apparently a little bit of a letdown, the crepes were very thin so essentially it was banana and Nutella. Prices are reasonable. Overall worth a visit.",

    "text": "I came here on a Friday morning looking for breakfast because it seemed to be a well-praised location on Yelp. The place seemed to be decently occupied with Regent Square locals and the waitress was pretty friendly, checking up on us multiple times throughout the meal.  The interior decoration is a bit quirky. There's a diner vibe with the tables, chairs, and bar counter, but the whole place is pretty colorful. From the bowls to the spots of color all over the place, color was indeed all over the place. I appreciated the local art hanging from the walls.  I decided to order the protein breakfast ($10) with scrambled eggs, bacon and their protein cinnamon pancake. My boyfriend tried their sweety white omelet ($11) which came with a side of fruit as well. We also ordered a side of sweet potato fries ($5) and OJ ($2.50). When the food arrived, we were ready to dig in. The OJ was maybe a little more than a cup in volume? and it was priced at $2.50, and another $2.50 for a refill! Definitely not worth it. The fries were super thin and unsatisfying, small portion size as well. The omelet, pancake, and eggs were okay. Nothing too outstanding about them. My boyfriend seemed to appreciate their thicker cut bacon.  Overall, for the price that we paid, I expected better. Either better quality or greater quantity. It was only an average meal and I don't believe it's worth its price.",

Anyway... I equate this cafe to Pamela's but ~better~.  This cafe is fun! I love the cartoon-y menu and and funky mugs for coffee; they reflect the casual vibe and uniqueness. They have an extensive food and drink menu. I ordered the Square Breakfast while my friend ordered the Brussels Sprout Bowl. I highly recommend both!   * The Square Breakfast ($9.50): 2 eggs anyway you like, your choice of breakfast meat, and a single pancake (or home fries + toast). I love that they have so many breakfast meats beyond the basic 3 even offering tofu. I tried Uncle Charley's Hot Sausage, and I wish I ordered 2 more... Tasty and personally, not that spicy!  * Brussels Sprout Bowl ($13.00): Cheesy grits topped with sauteed shaved Brussels sprouts, braised leeks, bacon, mushrooms and 1 egg over easy  I'm coming back to get a pancake dish. They have a lemon berry ricotta, pumpkin walnut, and cinnamon bun pancake... doesn't that sound so good?",

All of their food is fresh and tastes amazing. Definitely not your typical diner. I love how there's something for everyone here, whether if you are vegan, vegetarian, gluten-free, or have any other dietary restrictions/allergies. The menu is really unique, and there are always interesting specials each day.   After running a 5k in the freezing cold rain, I decided that I wanted something hot to drink to warm me up. I got a new drink, called \"Golden Milk,\" which is hot milk with cinnamon, turmeric, and ginger. Perfect for a chilly day. It was great!!! I had it made with almond milk since I'm dairy free. (Square Cafe has soy and almond milk) The hot drinks are also put in cute square mugs! For breakfast, I got the savory oatmeal with a side of chorizo. The portions were perfect, enough to satisfy my post 5k hunger! ;) The savory oatmeal alone was yummy, but the chorizo knocked it out of the park. It had TONS of flavor.   If you want a 5-star breakfast, come to Square Cafe. Just be aware that there is a wait, but it seems to go by fast. The food is definitely worth the wait though. In addition to the excellent food though; they have gift cards, catering, take-out, and more!!",

My boyfriend enjoyed his Square breakfast but said that it lacked flavor. However, it does cover all of the breakfast bases if you're looking for eggs, meat, potatoes and bread.  My Sweet Potato pancake was actually not all the way cooked through. The edges were done but the center was still very creamy and not firm. I have had sweet potato pancakes before and know that they usually add quite a bit of moisture to baked foods but this pancake was just plain undercooked. My  Cheese grits were good though.",

    "text": "For me, this is a tough review.  We were seeking a step up from the traditional greasy spoon that permeates Pittsburgh, particularly for a joint that offers vegan options  and the Square Cafe came up as top choice.  It definitely has a nice balance of healthy fare and alternatives that are a healthier slant on traditional breakfast fare.  Ambiance is wonderful.  Really bright and cheery on a blustery snowy Pittsburgh day.  The coffee was rather strong, but good and I loved the mugs that they are served in.  I imagine they are locally made.  Service was fine.  Friendly.  My hesitation is that I think it's a bit pricy for what it is.  Breakfast burrito with meat is $12 and doesn't include any sides.  Granted I didn't finish it because it's huge, but a side of toast or potatoes would have been nice.  Also, unfortunately, the scrambled eggs that were a dominant part of the burrito didn't have any kind of seasoning so the overall taste was bland.  Amish Cheddar was the cheese, and I forgot that the Amish tend to be pretty bland so it didn't add anything to the dish.  I did sample the pancakes, and those were pretty awesome.   I'm not sure that I would return for breakfast, but I would be open to giving lunch a try.",

    "text": "So I never in a million years would of tried this place if it wasn't for a great groupon deal I found!  Went here on a Friday for brunch and it was amazing!  I tried the Bacon, eggs, and asparagus OH MY!! It was a very interesting combination which I ended up loving. First there was a bed of crunchy hash browns with a layer of bacon and asparagus covering them. I got it topped with 2 eggs over easy along with a side of wheat toast. Everything was cooked perfectly to my liking with decent portion sizes too.  Then my brunch buddy for the day opted for a special they were having which was a mushroom frittata with cheese along side fresh greens. The greens looked delicious and he was very happy with the meal. I didn't get a chance to taste it but the greens looked fresh but the frittata seemed a bit unappealing to look at. I was told it tasted fantastic and to me thats what matters.  The wait staff was very nice and informative on the menu and our food came out in a timely manor.  The decor was very interesting as well. There was a local artist showing off her oil paintings which was awesome they support the local art scene only part of that I didn't like was someone stopped at our table and started taking pictures behind me of the art work which was a bit uncomfortable since I was shoveling food in my mouth lol.  Like to try this neat delicious little spot again and explore the menu more",

    "text": "So, I've heard about this place and I've wanted to stop by.  However, every time I go past the restaurant, the line is out the door and down the street.  I just don't have that kind of patience anymore, especially when it's the type of neighborhood place where people don't have a problem lingering over ham and eggs for hours.  You know that type of place... \"Come sit down with your New York Times crossword puzzle and take as long as you need.\"  Good for generating neighborly camaraderie, but bad for folks who just want to eat good food and go!  Well, during a recent bank holiday (President's Day to be exact!), my daughter Muff and I had the chance to stop in and eat without waiting in a line.  Yippee!  Skippee!  (It didn't hurt that it was probably 1 degree outside at 8:00am).  We were seated quickly and I honestly couldn't make up my mind as to what to eat.  Muff quickly settled on the Pumpkin Walnut Pancakes and Chicken Apple Sausage.  I kept scanning the dining room to see what looked appealing in person.  Finally, I settled on the Crab & Spinach Crepes with a Fruit Cup.  As stated in previous posts, I'm a crabmeat fiend.  My only hesitation is that some people don't know the difference between a crepe and a pancake. (There's lesson here for self-taught chefs who don't know the basics.)  The last thing that I wanted to eat what a mile high \"pancakey crepe\" with crabmeat, mushrooms, spinach and parmesan cheese sauce.  Yuck!  This dish was not that.  It was delicious with real crabmeat and not that weird fake stuff.  Nothing was overwhelming and everything melded together nicely. The fruit cup was also a nice accompaniment to the crepes and  was also a wonderful \"dead of winter\" touch.  Someone actually took the time to cut fresh fruit. (I know that sounds crazy, but do you know how often fresh fruit comes straight from the can?)  Muff's pumpkin walnut pancakes and chicken apple sausage were also nicely comforting and delicious.  Square Cafe is a nice homey place where you can tell the owners and staff care about their food and their customers.  I guess that I'm just jealous that I don't have a similar place nearby that serves high quality ingredients in a relaxed atmosphere.    Hey Square Care owners, can you open a place near me?",

The French Toast so was so fresh, light an fluffy!  The bacon an potatoes were perfectly cooked. I can't wait to go back!  Awesome food, great service, super friendly staff!",

My $11 pesto and mozzarella omelette was okay tasting, but overcooked and rubbery. The $2.80 coffee was weak. At least my daughters' French toast was good. Still waiting to find a brunch place in Pittsburgh that serves excellent food.  Our server was very pleasant and the food was served in good time, despite a full house.  UPDATED REVIEW We have since been back to this restaurant on several occasions and my impression of it has definitely improved. Coffee has been consistently very good, pancakes are amazing, and the breakfast burrito I had there recently was fantastic. Not sure if they've upgraded their cooking, but we have been very pleased with their dishes on the whole. Still too cramped, but there's not much they can do about it as long as they are in the space.",

As I've tried it on several occasions, thought it was time for a review. I've generally liked my experiences here, but what I appreciate most is the family friendly, community vibe. They're also known for their support of fellow local businesses. I've tried their sweet and savory dishes. In the past, I've had the root medley, brussel sprout hash, breakfast burrito, pancakes, and seasonal coffees (have more pics than shown here). The lemon ricotta pancakes are what have stood out the most, and I'll definitely go back for those! They change up the hot bevies seasonally which is fun. I chose the standard square breakfast this last time, it comes with your choice of meat. The menu for my meal says \"and toast\", but I was charged extra for it. Not sure if I misinterpreted something. The dish was okay, and that's generally how I feel about their food. It's not been consistently good in each of the dishes I've tried. It's in the middle of the road cost wise, but that's because of the quality of their food and their local sources, which I understand. My last check did take me aback for a simple breakfast though. A fellow yelper pointed out the plate share fee, which I have never seen or heard of. With that said, I do like this place, for the cozy neighborhood vibe and friendly customer service. Great outdoor seating during warmer days. Place gets packed so plan ahead!",

    "text": "My family and I are always looking for new breakfast/brunch spots to try in Pittsburgh, and we were originally drawn to Square Cafe by the fact that its menu is extremely adaptable for those with dietary restrictions and is not entirely egg-heavy, despite being a breakfast/brunch restaurant. Within one visit, it definitely managed to establish itself as a frontrunner on our list of favorites.  Square Cafe has a wonderful selection of vegan and vegetarian options, and while the staff does ask that you are mindful of the demands that modifications on a dish makes on the kitchen, they are simultaneously extremely flexible and helpful in ensuring that your dish is safe for your dietary needs.     My mother and I arrived around 12:30 on a Sunday afternoon and were able to get a table outside (though we had said the first available table, inside or outside, would be fine) within ten minutes of arriving. We ordered two dishes currently under the features portion of the menu -- the Plant-chero Bowl (with rye toast substituted in for tortilla chips) and the Ancient Grain Bowl --, the fresh fruit bowl, and coffee. The food arrived quickly, even in spite of the busyness, and our waitress was extremely helpful and attentive. Our dishes were very flavorful and filling, and the fruit was super fresh. While the final price tag was a little steeper than we usually opt for when going out for breakfast, the quality of the food and the experience that we had absolutely justified every penny.   So happy we tried this place!",

As for portions, they are bordering on \"not enough.\" I've been here four times and all times, I wished I'd have ordered more.   Always busy, so be prepared to wait in line. All in all, the hype is more than impressive than the food. I'm giving it a three because it's funky and cool, but the food is just all right.",

Maybe not Daughter and I shared a lemon berry  ricotta pancake it was warm and a bit too crusty for my liking one pancake of average size was 4.50  Service was nice and friendly  Place has a cute vintage vibe Street parking no meters",

I always feel like breakfast is harder with her because she doesn't eat eggs, but the this place was amazing. She got a matcha latte that she loved (in a really cute mug), a plant-chero bowl that she loved, and we split the pancake of the day(Chocolate eclair!!!). I got the chorizo bowl and I could barely finish it but it was so good! We sliced it so much we ordered breakfast for my family to take home.

My family includes a vegan, someone with Celiac, and two omnivores who live for the diner scene. The Square Cafe has a diner feel with culinary options to suit anyone, especially people with allergies. I personally love ordering a vegan version of the veggie omelet. Instead of eggs, I get tofu and dry toast with jam. There are also demarcations for gluten-free, vegetarian, and vegan menu items. The chorizo bowl is also a fan favorite. Not into breakfast/brunch? There are some great lunch items on the menu for vegans as well including the house made grain burger with lemon tahini sauce. The bottomless coffee comes in Square mugs (yes, I own one) and you are \"entitled\" to a to go cup of coffee! They also have dairy free creamers that make that coffee so much sweeter! I also love the gender neutral restrooms, great t-Shirts and stickers, and incredible wait staff. This place will definitely be a family favorite for a long time to come!",

Looking at the menu, you will find items you never thought would go together but you should try them as you will be surprised.   They are vegetarian and vegan friendly and you can even sit outside and bring your canine friend.   I wish I had one of these places closer to me and didn't have to wait for my visits to my daughter for a treat here and it is a treat with some of the best french toast on the planet!  They are open for breakfast and lunch, only. It's always been crowded when we have been there and full of happy people conversing and giving  a good time. The service is always fast, friendly and good. Highly recommend!!",

In fact, one piece of the the strawberry even had a HUGE black spot; totally ruined my appetite. Also, the crepes itself was way undercooked, and when the food came to table it was COLD and the cheese was in huge chunks and not melt at all. I'm no crepes expert, so maybe this cold crepes with chunky cheese inside is some sort of authentic style? Nonetheless, the moldy strawberry is totally unacceptable.   (This review is for the food only, and service is okay. The waitress responded quickly and refunded this dish in the end)",

    "text": "The Square Cafe  3 words: Get.  HERE.  Now.  Upon entering this buzzing little space in the Greater Pittsburgh area, you are welcomed with a WAVE of friendly faces that are subsequently extremely well-trained, amazingly attentive and extraordinarally fantastic at their perceived responsibilities.  I sat at the counter to avoid a short wait, which according to Britt-A-N-Y (my server!), told me they have had lines around the corner and wait times that make me have memories of my own family restaurant that was open for 16 years.  Let me say this real quick:   Brittany,. You are excellent at your craft.  You were extremely attentive and knew when to walk away and knew when to check on me.  You provided a Fantastic Customer Service experience today and I hope the owner takes this review into consideration upon your next employee review for a hopeful raise in pay.  Subsequently, I hope that she reaches out to me.  I would love the opportunity to give her a more detailed description of your performance and my review of her establiahment. And THANK her for her comitment to the local community here.  I LOVE IT.  I also was a chef, a restauranteur and a manager for multiple Fortune 500 companies in the restaurant industry and would love to consult with her if she is interested in growing her business.  Continuing though...  Everyone, this place does not disappoint: I had the weekend Brunch Special:  Spinach Mushroom and Ricotta Scramble served with a simple dressed salad greens with lemon juice, salt and pepper as well as their Signature \"Lemon-Berry and Ricotta Pancake\" served with locally made Syrup all of which were accompanied by a MUG of their Strongest Roast with a Shot of Espresso \"in the dark\".  First, the Coffee:  The Barista that made my coffee was busy the entire time.  Constantly Grinding, Packing, Steaming, Frothing and Foaming her way to my perfect cup.  Ya'll they basically have Coffee-Steins... Enjoy.  Additionally, her section and area was constantly kept up with and she worked with a precision that really shows the level of commitment necessary for that position.  Well done.  Next was a taste of the Scramble.  This was perfectly prepared and light like a souffle.  The Spinach was perfectly wilted, the mushrooms could have had about 30 seconds less in the pan as they were a bit over, but the Panchetta...  The Panchetta was diced small in uniform bits that were just perfectly seared as to render the fat a little and still have it squish as you chew.  It was PERFECT!  Flawless execution on the proteins.  Whomever cooked that Scramble in the back pretty much nailed it.  I want to talk with the Kitchen Manager.  Props.    The chilled greens served with the scramble were lightly dressed with freshly squeezed lemon juice and a dash of salt and pepper as if seasoned by Chef Emeril Lagasse himself with a dusting of, \"BAM\" precision.  Now, on a completely different food-gasm level was their Lemon-Berry Ricotta Pancake.  Folks, when I sat down, the gentleman next to me heard me tell Brittany that I was visiting from another city as I am a Travelling Uber and Lyft Driver that does this nationally from State to State in True Vagabond fashion.  As soon as my coffee order was left in Brittany's very capable hands, the gentleman to my left told me I had to try this culinary delight.  I did.  I suggest that you do too.   Crispy exterior with a soft warm center that was served with steam still wofting off of it with a melting bit of creamy butter and a Whipped Cream Star on top.  Served with a local Syrup that had the perfect amount of sweetness added to the tart and delicious lemon-nuanced pancake!  I wish I could've had room for another.  Cleaned the plate.... Worth the wait!  Again I say unto you:  Get.  HERE.  Now.  They really nailed it... 5 stars.  Open 7a-3p every day.",

My friend's French toast, though appropriately custardy, didn't seem to be made with actual brioche bread which made it a little soggy. We shared a blueberry ricotta pancake which was delightful.

I preferred the prior set up much more. There are fewer seats and you now sit right in the highest traffic area of the servers. Also, the floors were terribly disgusting. I know it gets wet outside and lots of people are walking around, but this is a restaurant and people are eating and it needs to be kept clean throughout operating hours.   Also, I'm not sure if these are new floors or what but it is SO LOUD inside now. I could barely hear my server and she was right next to me.   I was a solo diner and mostly felt like an imposition- to the host, to the server, to everyone. It was clear I was an afterthought and was mostly just messing up their ability to seat more people at the bar bc I was solo.   The food is still delicious. I give the food a 5, but the service, renovations, cleanliness, etc. all need a lot of work. It's really a shame because this used to be a nice, friendly neighborhood spot. It didn't feel like that today. I noticed the owner wasn't there today and she usually is when I'm there so maybe that was the problem. I hope things turn around.",

The brussel sprout hash was too bitter for me and a bit overpowering to enjoy on its own; topped with bacon, caramelized onions and mushrooms over cheesy grits.  This was my daughter's favorite of the two.  The chorizo hash was much better (in my mind) with chorizo chunks sauteed with onions, peppers, mushrooms over a bed of crispy tater tots and topped with cheddar cheese and an over-easy egg.  Rich and delicious!  Coffee flowed freely with plenty of people, baby and dog watching to be had. ;-)",

Sometimes there is a bit of a wait but I've never waited longer than like 20 minutes for a table.   Their lattes are so good. You gotta get one of the cool ones in the groovy mugs, they're my favorite part.   It's also a super cute location. The staff is awesome and I've only had great great experiences there. Never head a bad word about it.",

When I took my boyfriend here for the first time, we went every weekend after that for 3 weeks!!!  My mom loves the brussel sprout dish, my dad and boyfriend love the breakfast burrito, and I personally love any and all grit dishes they put on the menu. I especially love that they put what's gluten free and vegan on the menu, because being gluten free, sometimes gluten can sneak its way into dishes that I normally wouldn't think would be of concern.  My advice when you go is to GO EARLY! The wait is never too long (the service is impeccable truly), however smelling that delicious food while you're waiting in like can be TORTURE. I also recommend to get a smoothie either with your dish or to go. They're too good to pass up!",

They have lots of Southern-inspired breakfast items (hey, the South does have the best breakfast in all America) like cheese grits, biscuits and gravy, and andouille sausage.  Their eggs have a nice flavorful yolk, and they're always cooked perfectly.  The coffee is fantastic, and the service is prompt and friendly.  For you veg-heads and health-conscious people out there, Square Cafe has a variety of delicious omelets and breakfast features like butternut squash hash. Their menu changes from time to time, which keeps ordering interesting.  I've also recently forayed into their lunch items with the wild mushroom gnocchi, which can only be described as sublime.    Square Cafe is pretty popular, so there can be a wait (5-15 minutes, usually).  Just grab a cafe au lait and chill out until your table is ready.  Then be prepared to have your culinary world rocked!",

These two changes make a big difference.  The new menu, while still trying a bit too hard, now has flavorful food.  I don't know whether they changed their coffee blend, or just their process, but it's now been drinkable several times running.  So I give you permission to eat here again.  Congratulations to Square Cafe for solving the coffee issue!  Two things anyone eating here should still be aware of:  First, the portions are too large, which is certainly not going to bother most people - but if you're coming with a group, or with kids, just keep it in mind.  Second, ordering a la carte or off-menu is very, very expensive, so think carefully before you ask for an omelette that's not on the menu.",

Both times there was a wait of about 15-20 minutes, but that is to be expected since the restaurant is not very large. On Saturday I ordered the crab and avocado omelet and on Sunday I ordered a breakfast sandwich on chibatta bread with bacon, smoked Gouda and eggs. Both meals were fabulous, but if I had to chose one I would say the omelet was superior. The sandwich was pretty straight forward, and if a place is known for breakfast, it is pretty hard to mess up. The omelet though was unlike any I have ever had. It was full of crab meat and topped with a creme fresh reduction. It was one of the best omelets I have ever had. Also both times I ordered an Iced Vanilla Chai tea with soy milk and it was really good. They have a huge drink menu though, filled with very interesting drinks that you don't see all the time. My brother in law ordered the Gingerbread Chai tea and said it was very tasty. All in all, I had a great meal both mornings and would recommend this place .",

I had the breakfast burrito with soy sausage, my wife had the breakfast sandwich, and my son had the chocolate chip pancakes. Everyone was impressed with the food. Now the service, I am sorry I didn't get her name, but the young lady that waited on us was above and beyond what a waiter or waitress should be. She should seriously teach a class on how to treat customers! She was quick, refilled our glasses before they were empty, spoke to my son like a person. I would go here again and again! VERY HAPPY WE FOUND THIS PLACE! Great job everyone!",

She took my pancakes away and never returned. My initial waitress didn't seem to notice that anything had happened. I never got replacement pancakes. Nobody came back to refill my iced tea, ever.

Got seated quickly, but our service was slow and inadequate. Server refused to give us bread options for our sides and rather enjoyed saying he was either out of that option or they didn't have it. No wheat, English muffins, or sourdough toast-Really?! Ran out of orange juice too. Coffee was mediocre. Waited 50 minutes for our food while watching our server blatantly ignore our table. Had to ask host twice for refills. Got up and tracked down our server to see where our food was-he ran to the kitchen and came out 10 minutes later with our food in tow. Food was warm but my salmon omelet was inedible...tough brown pieces of salmon inside. Potatoes looked to be out of a bag. Green eggs and ham basic and no taste of pesto as advertised. Server made no attempt at noticing us picking at our food and choose to continue to ignore us along with remedy the situation. Won't be back.  Prices are a bit over the top too. $4 for a side of potatoes?!?! $5 for one pancake?!?! Not worth it. Go down the street to the small bfast spot or even across the street to D's instead.",

Square Cafe is a refreshing change of course.  They have the breakfast staples, yet manage to execute them better.  Not greasy, always fresh, and always leave happy.  They do a lot of twists to make things more interesting.  My personal favorite are their takes on eggs Benedict.  Their summer menu had it made with beef short ribs and side of salad greens.  The fall version uses crab cakes with a side of salad greens.  It is a perfect breakfast, tasty, hardy, but not overwhelming.  Their crepes, pancakes, and anything they do with smoked salmon are also great.  They have brew a great cup of coffee as well.  Their breakfast prices are somewhat more than some other establishments, but its worth it.  We always leave feeling that we made a right choice for breakfast.",

We planned to meet at 11:30, thinking that the breakfast crowd would be winding down; yet before the crazy lunch time started. Not so...I arrived a little early (11:15), thinking I would get the table and have a cup of coffee only to find out that they will NOT seat you until your entire party has arrived. We were not seated until after Noon. That's a long time to stand in a very tiny entrance way. We ordered salads which were OK, and coffee. They refilled our coffee twice, and the waitress was nice, but she really wanted us to eat and get going, as the long wait line was still growing after 1pm. When we asked about desserts, she said that they had biscotti and a few cookie choices at the counter but weren't really offering any real desserts. We felt so rushed that we left without exchanging our gifts. This is not a cafe where you can sit and leisurely enjoy a cup of coffee with friends; but rather a \"wait, eat & run\" type of place...too bad!",

They seemed like regular pancakes to me with some cinnamon, cloves, etc.   The service here is very friendly though. Waitress was nice and recommended seasonal items to us. They use some kind of phone app to take orders which is pretty interesting. Since this place is a cafe they have free Wi-fi.

Also, the 4 stars is because the staff (while super nice!) they do tend to rush you through your meal - I get it, they are really busy - but if you want a long brunch, to catch up with friends - I would skip this place and go to EASE up the road.",

Allergy aware and may delicious and interesting options to try.  And the coffee! best coffee we had in the Burgh - brewed or specialty.  Had brewed regular there and got a latte to go!  What they are doing, they are doing well. Also square mugs??? Thought it would feel akward in  my hands, exact opposite.  Brought one home to the ATL and only wished I had brought more.",

    "text": "We had a large party and needed two highchairs, and even though Square Cafe doesn't take reservations they will make a \"note\" of your party's size and arrival time if you call a few days before hand, which we did and they were able to accommodate us. The hostess was great and worked with us to get us seated as soon as our whole party arrived.   Our waitress was friendly and made sure we understood the surcharge on eggs due to the current avian flu shortage. She refilled coffee and waters in a timely manner, and provided the toddler with us crayons and an activity place mat which was very much appreciated.   Everyone enjoyed their breakfasts and one member of our party really like that she could substitute the buttermilk pancake for a cinnamon swirl pancake with the square breakfast, for an additional charge. Also, the variety of sausage available almost made me change my order from bacon to the chicken apple sausage, oh well next time...   My sunny side up eggs and home fries hit the spot, and my husband DEVOURED his Say Uncle Hot Sausage Hash. Overall, everyone at the table was pleased with their meals.   We'll definitely be back, because I still need to try that chicken apple sausage.",

    "text": "I visited for brunch at 1pm today with a friend.  Although they don't accept reservations or use No Wait, they got us in surprisingly quickly (in 10 min., despite an estimate of 20-30 min.).  We were seated at the table closest to the door, but I found it quite warm, and didn't feel chilly at any point, despite the constant stream of customers.  Between us, we ordered the following: Sun dried tomato scramble with goat cheese and spinach (me), brussels sprout hash (my friend), side of bacon (split), and two 16 oz specialty drinks (regular cinnamon bun latte for me, decaf gold star (?) latte for my friend).  The food came out quite quickly--less than 10 min. after ordering, I believe--and our waitress was quite efficient, despite being one of only two working with a large crowd.  Generally, we were pleased with the quality of the food.  My one criticism was that the ingredients could have been more evenly distributed throughout the scramble--some pieces consisted only of egg, and all of the goat cheese was concentrated in one area.  Once I mixed up the ingredients, the flavors and textures combined, complementing one another nicely.  The addition of some hot sauce, salt, and pepper enhanced them even more.  The spring mix was served with my entree undressed, but I used the orange garnish to add some juice, which dressed it up nicely.  The bacon was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of crunch and give.  Finally, my latte was just sweet enough (not overly so), with a good milk:coffee ratio, rounding out the savoriness of the scramble and bacon.  Although I didn't sample my friend's dish or latte, she enjoyed them, as well.  As others have mentioned, I felt that the portions were on the smaller side, esp. given the price (our check came to $34).  Fortunately, I had a city dining card for this place ($10 discount), but even so, after tip, I paid close to $30.  For this reason, I'm tempted to knock off half a star.  However, because I liked the vibe, was pleased with the quality of the food and the service, and appreciate the fact that this place offers several healthy, vegetarian, and GF options, I'm awarding an even 4 stars.",

I had the Brussels sprout hash (caution: not vegetarian) and a single order of the pumpkin walnut pancake.  My hash was served over cheesy grits and had an over easy egg on top.  It was delicious.  The pancake was sweet but not too sweet.  But there was bad: We were forgotten about.  Which is fine, and understandable on a very busy Saturday morning.  But we were made to feel bad about being there, about being forgotten, about wanting more than one cup of $3.00 bottomless coffee, about one member of our party's food being left unmade, about not leaving.  It was such a disappointing experience.",

The fries were there and they were good.  As for the rest:  the tortilla was small and not grilled, there was no feta cheese, no sun-dried tomatoes, no squash, no peppers, and no onions, as far as I could tell.  There was mostly lettuce and a few pieces of zucchini. There was a faint flavor of cumin, but nothing in the wrap--like feta!!--that might have given it some moisture and possibly some taste. It was a very disappointing and tasteless dish. My husband also disliked his Veggie Wrap, but said it had a lot of zucchini but not much else.  $9.50 would have been reasonable for the wrap as advertised.  As served consisting of a tortilla, lettuce, and 2 or 3 thin slices of zucchini--not so much.   ( I thought of complaining at the time and I am sorry I did not.  We were meeting up with an old friend and were busy talking and catching up and it didn't seem to be appropriate to inject this issue into our get-together.)",

    "text": "As of today, I'm a big proponent of brunch. Before, I might have tagged along with friends to a cafe or a bar/restaurant for brunch, but I placed more weight on catching up on my sleep (rotating 12-hour shifts can do that, you know). You also would have never found me taking part in brunch alone.  After taking a 3-hour exam in the morning, I realized (well, my stomach and my glucose-deprived brain realized) that, with the exception of some iced coffee on my way to the testing center, I had been fasting for almost 16 hours (yikes!). (Note: if you're going to take an early morning exam, I don't recommend that you do what I did). I flopped down into my car and opened my Yelp app for some breakfast/brunch places close to where I live in Shadyside (I wasn't in the mood for a burger or salad). The first couple of places didn't pique my interest...then up came Square Cafe. This place had great reviews, the pictures looked legit, and wasn't top far away.  After I parked, I walked over to the cafe. By this time, it was around 11:30 AM. There were 4 groups of people eating outside in front of the cafe. I walked inside and was immediately greeted by an employee before I had the chance to breathe in the smell of coffee or listen to the chatter of the customers. Speaking of the customers, there was very little indoor seating left except for several open seats at the bar. I opted to sit there. Within a minute, the waitress brought me the menu and asked if I wanted coffee (of course I did).  What I like about their menu was that it wasn't too short or too long (like, Chinese-restaurant-long); it had a wide selection of breakfast and lunch dishes; it had quite a few gluten-, vegetarian-, and vegan-friendly options; and their prices were reasonable. I chose to get their vegetarian scramble with Swiss cheese and wheat toast. After around 10 minutes, I got my food. The scramble looked good and not too messy. The cheese seemed to have helped keep all the eggs and vegetables together. There was a side of hash browns, and four small pieces of buttered wheat toast with a side of strawberry jam.  The scramble itself was great! The egg was cooked just right, the vegetables were cooked but still crisp, and there was an even amount of cheese distributed throughout. It was maybe a tad salty...but I generally don't eat too many salty food, so I might have a lower threshold for saltiness. The hash browns were also great. They were cooked just right without any pieces being burnt or undercooked, and salty or bland. The buttered toast were good...but then again, who can mess up buttered toast? I finished most of my plate; I left several pieces of toast and some hash browns because it was a lot of food.  I am pretty impressed with the diverse clientele. There was a good mix of younger couples in their 20s having a brunch date, business people having a power lunch, and older people in their 60s reading the newspaper. I didn't feel out of place eating alone because the bar was almost full halfway through my meal. By the time I left around 12:30, a line was forming outside the entrance.  I will definitely come here again for breakfast, brunch, or lunch any day. It would be even better if they could serve Bloody Mary's and other cocktails...but I'm content with their selection of healthy shakes and smoothies that are made with vegan protein powder and whole fruits.",

They are friendly and efficient which makes the experience even better.   The food! Oh gosh, the food. I haven't had one dish I dislike! However, I HAVE to get a pancake with whatever I get. They are TOO good!! I love how the menu changes with the seasons so you always have different options. It is especially helpful since everyone seems to be a regular! The coffee is also delicious as well as the specialty coffee drinks.   I HIGHLY recommend going to Square Cafe at least once every weekend :)",

Not to mention that my fellow Yelper Meghan B. adores this place so I wanted to try it out. I'm so glad I did!  We went on a Friday afternoon and I was surprised by how packed it was. We ended up sitting outside just so we didn't have to wait. We didn't mind, though. The outdoor seating is pretty cute! Our server was prompt and friendly and understood that we were going to order a lot due to having a $40 towards food (we only paid $20 for it!).  I wanted to try something different, but after an awesome chest day at the gym, I wanted some meat and ordered a burger. It was awesome! Now, the patty did appear to be frozen, however the garlic toasted bun and beautifully positioned toppings totally made up for it. Nothing wrong with frozen patties, but I just expected it to be a little more gourmet. Not complaining. It was still very good considering the place isn't a burger joint. I had a side of fries that were crispy and delicious and cole slaw that wasn't too heavy.   We also ordered a Nutella/Strawberry crepe. It was my first time ever trying a crepe and I fell in love! I'm not really one for super sweet meals, so I don't think I would order this as a breakfast entree, but it totally hit the spot after my burger. We also split a Chunky Monkey pancake. Wow! Not too sweet, but just sweet enough. You really didn't even to use much syrup. It had bananas, chocolate chips, whipped cream and topped with coconut.   I have officially fallen in love with this place and can't wait to go back and introduce more people to this delicious goodness! It's a shame it's only open till three, but from the looks of it, they make enough during the morning and afternoons to close their cash registers comfortably.",

Additionally, we had only one set of silverware, and I waited for well over five minutes before I was able get someone on the wait staffs attention. I also ordered bacon. 3 bacon strips for $5. Didn't really seem worth it to me to be honest.   Overall, the wait staff wasn't very attentive (they were busy, but It should not have taken me as long as it did to flag someone down for silverware) and the bacon was disappointing.

    "text": "Review update! I returned twice in the past month (yes, I'm obsessed) and tried their crepes as a brunch item, rather than their strictly breakfast items. Their asparagus and Bavarian ham crepe is incredible! The asparagus was prepared just right and the flavors all together was a party in a mouth. The asiago cream sauce was to die for as well. I basically licked the plate clean. Same goes for the chicken and wild mushrooms crepe as well. The same sauce was served with this crepe and the flavors were wonderful. Have to say my favorite out of the two was definitely  the asparagus and Bavarian ham crepe. Service is always awesome! And I just had to purchase one of the awesome mugs, $18 may be a little pricey for one- but they are hand made and unique ! This place deserves nothing less than 5 stars:)!",

    "text": "In Philly, brunch is like a sport.  We do it well and I am a skilled athlete.  Gold medal Olympic skills son.  Perhaps brunch is not a sport on the other side of the state.  Maybe brunch in the burgh is just an exhibition game?  We went to the square cafe on a Sunday morn.  Brunch was in full swing at this tiny place.  We put our names in and took a quick walk around the block.  Back at the cafe, the place was still hopping.  We were a party of 3, difficult to seat when places are busy.  They sat another threesome at a large table and the waitress came over and asked if we wanted to share the table to reduce our wait time.  Sure.  No worries.  Even though we sat at the same table, we exchanged a few smiles with our table buddies and said nothing the rest of the time.  Kinda weird.  Anyways, the menu was full of options.  I had a hard time deciding, but went with a western omelet.  My friends went with nutella and banana crepes and a veggie omelet.    The staff was good.  The omelet was ok.  The potatoes that came with the omelet were so so.  They were kind of a downer actually.  There was a hitch with the crepes, but they were quickly fixed.  The waitress was really nice and attentive.  Odd because our table buddies complained about her to management.  Then again, they complained about everything in their lives, or at least when I chose to listen in, that was all I heard.  I was told this is one of few places to get an awesome brunch in Pittsburgh.  Perhaps because of that, I was a bit let down.  If back around these parts, I will probably look elsewhere.  Its just not a fair match for me.",

My boyfriend's egg sandwich with apple smoked chicken sausage was incredible - I never knew a breakfast sandwich could taste so good! My pumpkin pancakes came out undercooked the first time around, so they took them back and re-made them for me (and then they were delicious). Why only 4 stars instead of 5? The service wasn't great..our server was very nice, but slow. Apparently their computers went down while we were there (she didn't take our orders until at least 25 minutes after we got there). And when they re-did my pumpkin pancakes, they didn't come back out until everyone else had finished eating (so it took quite a while). Would I go back? Definitely!",

    "text": "Square Cafe is one of my favorite brunch spots. The menu is extensive, unique, and vegetarian-friendly, and they almost always have fun daily specials - this is not your typical pancake-and-eggs place. I dined there the last two weekends and some of the specials we ordered were deep-fried pierogies with cajun ranch and German chocolate pancakes with a mind-blowing coconut creme sauce. I personally love the brussel sprout hash, the vegetable crepes, and the bacon.  That being said, there is often a long wait to be seated on weekends (a testament to how good it is, make sure your whole party is present or else you'll wait longer) and the service is often spotty. There's one server (I don't know his name but he's been there for a while and has lots of tattoos) who is fantastic. However, this past weekend, we had another server and it was pretty terrible - she was basically MIA and could not answer any of our questions. The worst part is that I made a slight special request to my dish (asked for a certain sauce on the side, which I've done countless times) - my meal arrived without it, I asked for it again, there was lots of back and forth with significant delays, she said she'd place the order, only to return 15+ minutes later with no sauce and no apology. I asked for sour cream instead and had to wait another 5 minutes, by which point everyone else had long finished eating. Disappointing.",

    "text": "Nothing spectacular, although this was my first visit. This place specialized in vegan fare as well as carnivorous.   As I looked over the menu I was surprised to see vegan omelets, but the egg wasn't egg substitute, it was real egg. Kinda defeats the purpose of being vegan.   So as I searched the menu I found the obligatory vegan burger that everyone offers. This veggie patty was made with mushrooms, onions, peppers and black beans, seasoned to perfection with cilantro, curry, and cumin, served on a kaiser roll... Yawn! Been there, done that, and I bet it will fall apart when I lift it off the plate and drip out of my roll when I take the first bite. Yep I was right,  All over the plate, it's like a huge black bean mom gave birth to a bunch of black beans. Seriously if you insist on having a veggie burger on your menu, please just serve a Boca burger and top it however you like. I'm really tired of home made vegan burgers that leave an empty bun in your hand after first bite.   Next time I'll do the vegetable wrap, it looks more appetizing with mixed greens, sauteed zucchini, mushrooms, spinach, and feta with a sun dried tomato spread.   So I hope the menus for these so called vegan friendly restaurants start coming up with imaginative offerings other than black bean burgers on white rolls. BORING!",

    "text": "eeeeeee I'm sorry Square Cafe, but I'm taking a star away.  Don't hate me.  I still really like you.  I'm just downgrading from \"love\" to \"really like.\"  I have tried a few other food items besides the Hopple Popple, and none of them have been 5 star worthy brunches.  I just came in Saturday around 11 (and, delightfully, we barely waited for a table), and the menu was all different.  That was exciting.  I decided to try the Green Eggs and Ham - pesto scrambled eggs with ham.  It was all pretty good - eggs didn't have quite as strong of a pesto taste as I'd like (my boyfriend's mom observed that they tasted more like \"basil\" and less like \"pesto\").  But the ham was pretty tasty.    I tried my boyfriend's fried chicken and biscuits, and I was super not-impressed.  No.  Where to begin.  Chicken was boneless, and breaded in a coating similar to what you get when you get fish 'n' chips.  It was sort of like....a chicken finger....in fish breading.  I can't explain it any better.  But it was sort of bizarre in that way.  The gravy had a strange taste to me, a little too sweet perhaps?  And the biscuits were more crumbly, less flaky.  Also my boyfriend's mom got the sausage and ricotta frittata, and she said it was pretty good, but didn't have much sausage to go around.  I tried it too - the sausage was tasty, but definitely not plentiful.    The last few times I've been in, I've felt this way - like the food isn't quite as good as I remember it.  Still, service is great, atmosphere is adorbs, and I still just like being there.  I should also say that the one time I didn't have good service, the manager dealt with it FABULOUSLY, and was hugely responsive to me.  It gave me a great vibe about the place and encourages me to keep coming back and trying more brunch items.",

The wait staff is always super laid back and friendly as well and seem to go above and beyond to be real and chat......so ok, on with the food.  So SC may be a tad overpriced, but they serve a great brunch. The veggie omelet is always solid and always chock full of steamed veggies. They do a really great soy latte as well- served in these cool, square mugs.   Beware- the place gets packed during brunch! There is a coffee bar area where you can sit and wait, so I suggest bringing a laptop with you while you wait.",

Its a pretty standard brunch place with cute decor and crowded saturday mornings, with people meeting up to catch up from the week, but it also has a great menu selection, lots of seating, and the portions are on the larger side.  Only complaint I have is that coffee is a little pricey and I know some people like the little mugs they use, but I felt like mine was a little dirty :(.  So far I've only tried the breakfast foods, and all were quite tasty.  Service was also pretty good, even though it's always crowded at Square Cafe.

    "text": "I came for brunch on a recent Friday. I had the Brussel (sic) Sprout Hash; my companion had cornmeal pancakes and a side of sausage.  The hash was absolutely phenomenal. I normally experiment with different dishes, but if I return to Square Cafe, I will simply order it again. The sprouts were done as perfectly as I've ever had sprouts (tender, but with a little resistance left in them), the ham and onion provided a good counterpoint, and the ensemble was served over (quite good) grits and under a (nicely runny-yolked) egg.  All the flavors worked well together, and the portion was just right for a robust brunch.  My companion allowed me to sample her cornmeal pancakes, which I found to be a competent version of the offering; the berry preserves were excellent, and pairing the pancake with a bite of sausage is quite nice. The portion size was large -- we were unable finish them.  She also assured me that the coffee was top-notch; I did not partake.  I intend to return; if the hash is consistently this good, I may have found a new favorite brunch place.  ----  Quick update: returned this recent Friday, had the Brussels Sprout Hash again. Was not as good as the previous trip. Sprouts were hard (needed a little more time), and the yolk of the egg was barely runny (needed less time). Hoping this was an off day for the chef, and I didn't just get lucky the first time.  Update 2: returned (again) and had the hash (again), and it was prepared more correctly this time -- slightly softer sprouts and runny yolk very much in evidence.",

There was a wait for a table so we sat at the bar. Ten minutes after we placed our order a woman came up to the bar and complained that her food was taking a long time, the barista kindly explained that everyone's food was taking longer than usual and it will be out as soon as it's ready.  Fifteen minutes later a server came to us with two plates, but only one was correct. I told her that the dish in her other hand was not what I ordered, so she gave my friend her french toast with strawberries (which she loved). My server appeared out of nowhere and all ready knew the situation. She said that the food runner must have given us another customer's order and that my dish would take a little bit longer. I thanked her and told her it was no big deal and I didn't mind waiting. Five minutes later my asparagus and goat cheese scramble arrived, and it was well worth the wait. Although I am not a fan of sun dried tomatoes; next time I will see if they can make it without. Our server apologized profusely for the mistake. I'm a server as well, and I know these mistakes happen. It didn't bother me one bit. A few minutes later our server surprised us with 2 strawberry graham cracker milkshakes!! Although I am gluten intolerant (which she did not know), the gesture was greatly appreciated (and my friend was ok with taking mine home!).  The white bean hash is my favorite thing here! It is gluten free also! It has a ton of flavor and textures and eggs are always cooked perfectly. My friend said the pumpkin spiced latte was the best she has ever had.   This restaurant consistently serves quality meals with great flavor at a fair price. The servers and baristas are personable, friendly, and down to earth.

Also with the help of social deals like groupon it may get me back in the door sooner than later. So with my deal in tow I took \"Mai\" back to square cafe for breakfast. Out the door by 9:30am and we were on our way to run errands and enjoy the 80 degree weather.   I don't work Mondays bc I work weekends Repping so when everyone is back at work I get to enjoy low key, uncomplicated, minus the masses dining at this normally unavailable restaurant. FREEDOM!!   Today at Square Cafe I had a sublime breakfast with \"Mai\". I have been craving crepes for awhile and since I am avoiding sweets I decided on the Vegetable Crepes, Sauteed zucchini, mushrooms, onions, peppers, spinach, and sun-dried tomato spread topped with just the right amount of parmesan shavings.  The crepes were thin with the right blending of flavors from the light veggies, sundried tomato matched well adding the tang, acid, and fruity balance.   Sitting outside on a day like today is faultless and makes the stress of running around after a horrible weekend much easier to look forward to.",

It is located on the cute street of South Braddock in Regent Square and always has a huge crowd of people waiting outside. Get there early to get a seat as it is packed on the weekends.  We went on an early Sunday morning and were able to get a seat for two outside with no wait which I wasn't expecting but it was perfect!  I had the avocado bacon omelet which was amazing-stuffed with bacon and tomatoes and topped with fresh avocado.  We also tried the breakfast tacos but beware they are super spicy.  On a past visit I had the oatmeal pancakes and French toast which were simply delicious.  Great place for kids and you can sit outside with your dog.",

We arrived at 9:15 and the place was already packed but thankfully we only waited a few minutes before we were seated, and luckily no one needed to wait outside for a table in the below freezing temps.  The menu had some different offerings than the last time I was there so it was a nice chance to try something different.  I ordered the Brussels Sprouts Grits which were Sauteed Brussels sprouts, bacon, braised leeks and mushrooms served over cheesy grits with 1 egg over easy.  I also was craving something sweet so I ordered a piece of French toast on the side.  My friend ordered a breakfast sandwich with Amish cheddar and bacon.  I also ordered an almond milk latte.  Overall I enjoyed my trip to Square Cafe more than I did a few months ago.  Maybe they were having a \"off\" morning that morning.  The food was tasty and delivered quickly with friendly service.  I will definitely be returning again for breakfast.",

I blame myself because I should have gotten a breakfast item from the menu.  All of the tables around me ordered breakfast items and their dishes looked wonderful.  Our service was pretty average, and the atmosphere was fun.  I will have to go back and get something for breakfast one of these days for a second opinion!",

He brought our drinks out super quick and took our orders without us having to wait around for a ridiculous amount of time. We all really liked him. Also, Square cafe also has many options that are vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free which is definitely a plus.  What I didn't like was how ridiculously LONG the wait was here. If the food was AMAZING - I could understand the lines of adoring customers, but to be honest, the food is just okay. I feel like they nickel and dime you for additions to your meal like if you want sausage in a breakfast burrito that consists of eggs and cheese. My friend got one of the vegan options and didn't like it that much either. It was just okay... I've had better brunch/breakfast foods elsewhere. I also think that the prices are a little steep for what they're serving.   One thing that really turned me off about this restaurant is how everyone is a vegetarian or a vegan, but they want to make it KNOWN that they are. I don't mind if you don't eat meat or dairy products. Even my friend who was with me who is a vegetarian thought it was obnoxious. We felt like we were living in a real life skit of Portlandia. Someone actually got pissy that the restaurant didn't carry vegan butter. They followed up by saying, \"ugh, I don't get it, it's so easy to make.\" During this conversation this person mentioned MANY times that she was a vegan as if NOBODY within hearing distance didn't hear her the first 9 times she said it.   It was so lame. I hope this place doesn't turn into a pretentious place where people hate on you if you don't eat a gluten free diet.   I just have mixed feelings. There were things I liked and things I didn't. I probably wouldn't come back.",

The wait makes me want to bump this down to three stars, but I don't think I can because of the quality of the food and service. When I brunched here two weeks ago, they event put out blankets on all of the seats outside to keep the brunchers warm! But seriously, the people who work here are very nice. I've gotten the pumpkin pancakes (yyyyuuuuummmmm) and some sort of banana chocolate pancakes (double yum). And I love the cute coffee mugs they have for coffee and tea.

Also love their Chorizo Tostada and Salmon Crepes.It's also fun to sit outside and dog watch in the spring, summer, and fall. For Sundays if you can get there early before 9 (?) or very late in the day is best, though the early crowd generally equals quite a few screeching children (which is fine if that suits your needs - it's nice that it is so accommodating to families in the neighborhood). I like going closer to 1 on a Sunday (or just on weekdays) so I don't feel rushed to clear a table and can keep enjoying another mug of after breakfast coffee.",

Plates are moderately priced around $10-13 per plate, however the servings were a bit on the small side for some of our plates but i didn't feel ripped off.

The service was great and friendly and our food was almost very very good.  I had the Square Protein breakfast with eggs that were oozing that yolky goodness.  And my better half had an omelete with spinach and feta, she didn't speak much during the meal, so that's a plus.  LOL.

Service was lacking for the price and quality of the decor. Our server displayed what I can only describe as \"attitude\" when we politely asked for a substitution due to a dietary restriction. First she was silent for about 60 seconds and then simply said, \"Ummm NO - we don't do that.\" Well, thank you ma'am!  Also, while I appreciate the fact that they seem to have gone to lengths to put gluten-free options on the menu, unfortunately they were not the tastiest options. The gluten-free corn pancakes had a sour flavor that maple syrup didn't cover...avoid. Also, I thought the homefries my companion got with her omelette were some of the worst I've seen...they were...completely deep fried...more like tiny squares of french fries. In my experience, homefries are supposed to be made from boiled potatoes cut up and sauteed on the grill with onions, etc. and I would expect nothing less for a place that serves $12 omelettes.",

We usually only get over there when we are having brunch with the fam, despite the fact that it's only about 10 minutes away. This time I got the smoked salmon scramble. It has salmon, eggs and cream cheese and came with salad greens. The salmon scramble was amazing. The eggs were cooked so well and the little chunks of cream cheese made it so creamy. The BF got the square breakfast, which is really just a regular breakfast, albeit a really good regular breakfast. All seemed really pleased with their choices, but I think I ordered the best, to be honest. The veg scramble looked pretty dam good, but this place has a lot of really interesting choices and I like to experiment when I go there. They seem to have something for everyone with a menu full of gluten free, vegetarian and vegan options. They also have some new blended beverages now which could give Starbucks a run for their money. I got the salted caramel chia frozen drinky thing and it was reallllllly good. I was honestly kind of surprised. Now, I will say this place can be a little pricey, but when you consider what you get and the quality it all evens out. Our waitress this time was a little.... let's say surly... but that was a first, so I'm guessing she was just having an off day. I suggest going here with an open mind and trying something new and exciting. You will not regret it!",

    "text": "In the words of Arnold, \"I'll be backkkkk.\" No, really. As soon as I can.  This place nails service, food and vibe. You're probably looking for menu teasers, so I'll get down to it: order the lemon ricotta pancakes. Then, have your friend next to you order the pulled pork eggs benedict (piled on grit cakes and covered in country gravy and scallions) with a bed of field greens. Can you say \"splitsies\"? Why throw all your balls in the \"sweet\" or \"savory\" courts when you can have both, right?  Also, take note of their creative cappuccino menu with reasonable prices. One more thing, they allow you to order pancakes in single orders (big fan of restaurants that do this). My sister was all about her smoked salmon omelette (cream cheese and capers), if that sounds up your alley.   Big props to our server for handling our large group like a pro. His strong voice was the perfect match for our madhouse family.",

It heathy, delicious, and happy eating.  The workers are friendly, and so are the people who done.  Every month they feature a community artist work on their walls.  I have tried just about everything and to me it's all delicious!!  My absolute favorite right know... Since the menu changes every season... Is the Short Rib Benedict.  It comes with corn fritters topped with slow cook short ribs, caramelize onions two eggs over easy and hollandaise sauce served with fresh greens. Yummy!!!  I also love their Gluten Free Berry Pancakes serves with fresh berries and a drizzle of honey.  No syrup needed!  I recommend this place to all who want fresh, delicious options for breakfast and lunch!!!  You will enjoy!!",

    "text": "My partner's family was in town today so we met them at Square to get breakfast because it's one of the only spots in the city that has vegan and omni options. After waiting for almost an hour for a table, we watched the host quietly approach another large party that had gotten there after we had to let them know that their table was ready. They always call out people's names loudly, so this was definitely some shady BS. My partner immediately went to ask what was going on with our table, and the host said it was almost ready. We watched him grab a folded up table from outside and stick it on the end of two tables jammed up right in the middle of the restaurant. The group that had been seated before us got a nice corner booth. It's a small space and there were lots of big parties in there, so none of this would've been an issue if he hadn't skipped over us right in front of our faces. But it just felt gross that we were given such a garbage table after that. It's understandable that you want to hook up people who work there, family members, etc. but maybe don't make it so glaringly obvious that you're doing it.  I was the only vegan there and I usually always get the Peanut Butter Pancakes and Soy Sausage because they're the only vegan things I've had there that aren't disappointing. But they just changed the menu and had a Curry Tofu Scramble that looked good, so I ordered that. Surprise, it was really bland and definitely not a scramble. It was cubes of tofu that were completely flavorless in the center, mixed with some decent vegetables and the most boring side salad in the world. The days of \"it's just hard to make vegan food taste good\" and \"vegans will eat anything if it's vegan\" are over, so I'd like to suggest to Square that they give a little more of a shit when developing their veg recipes. Everyone else liked their food alright.  As everyone was close to finishing their food (we'd been there a little over 30 min including ordering and waiting for food), multiple servers came over to harass us about getting us boxes and taking our plates. One of them walked up to my partner's dad and asked \"are you done eating\" twice in a row. That's an insanely rude and awkward way to clear a plate. There was no \"is there anything else you need\" just a really uncomfortable attempt to get us out as fast as possible. Guess what the large party that was seated before us was doing? They were being left alone to finish their coffee and talk.   I've worked in the service industry for years and I absolutely cannot stand when people write negative reviews with little reason. When you go out to a popular brunch spot on a Sunday, you should always expect things to feel hectic and to have worse than usual service.  I've been on the other side of nightmare Sunday brunches, I get the anxiety, frustration and desire to turn tables as quickly as possible. But being bumped down the line for a table and then being unceremoniously ushered out the second we were done was pretty unreal. Definitely a crap enough experience to make me never go back there.",

    "text": "Square Cafe has been one of my favorite brunch spots for years. I don't live in the area anymore, so last Sunday I was pretty stoked when my friend asked if I wanted to get SC post-workout grub and a latte for the 1.5 hour drive home.  During my visit, I ordered the tandoori jackfruit bowl with two fried eggs, a cinnamon (bun) protein pancake, and the Smokin' Mocha to wash it all down. The bowl was loaded with huge chunks of jackfruit, diced sweet potatoes, sliced mushrooms, and scallions all tossed in smokey tandoori masala spices - which was perfect on it's own, but even better with the runny egg yolk from the two fried eggs I added. The cinnamon protein pancake was the size of the plate, fluffy, and topped with a generous smear of cream cheese glaze. The Smokin' Mocha (chocolate, spiced brown sugar, and cayenne pepper) was sweet and spicy and perfect to sip on while waiting outside on a cold day for a table. I love chili and chocolate together, so I was immediately sold on this before I even tasted it. The portions are always bigger than I remember. Our entire meal was under $40.  The wait for a table on a busy day is always estimated to be 20 minutes, but is never more than 15 (if that). Our service was great, too, of course. No matter how packed the house is each time I've visited, the staff keeps it together and never seems to miss a beat. The friendly fellow who waited on our table was prompt and a pleasure to have as our server.    The menu changes seasonally, so there is always new stuff to try each time I return (I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the lavender, white chocolate, coconut latte they had on the menu a few seasons ago makes a comeback). The atmosphere is pretty laid-back and the service is always good. I never get tired of eating here and appreciate that the menu caters to a lot of dietary preferences.",

I got that guilty feeling while eating it...

    "text": "My friend and I have been trying to come to Square Cafe for a year.  Last year, she made a reservation for my birthday, and when we called to verify, they said they couldn't guarantee us a seat.  Uh... what is the point of a reservation then?  We finally tried Square Cafe for the first time a few weeks ago.  I ordered a breakfast burrito, known as Uncle Charley's Hot Sausage Breakfast Burrito ($10.99), and my friend ordered the leek, asparagus, and cheese frittata ($9.29).  My breakfast burrito was good and tasted delicious, but the portion was very small for the price.  I ate the entire thing with no issues, and I weigh just over 100 pounds.  My friend's frittata wasn't very good, though, and the side of grits she ordered were just ok.  The food was good but not notable enough for me to be dying to come back.  Our server was a nice guy who explained the menu really well.  When he brought over the bill, we found out there was a pay it forward chain going through the restaurant.  We paid it forward in the server's tip, but it's cool that this place is into that kind of thing.  The ambiance is good!  A big problem:  It was really cold in the restaurant because despite having double doors, they propped the second set of doors open, which let all of the seventeen degree air into the space.  This was the difference between 3 and 4 stars for me.  I cannot enjoy a meal when I'm cold.  I really wanted Square Cafe to be the trendy cafe where I could regularly enjoy brunch, but in the end, it's just ok.  I would come back if someone suggested it, but I don't think I would come back here on my own.",

    "text": "Square Cafe is my standby when I have guests in town or when I want a special breakfast. Here's why:  Unique options: Square Cafe's menu changes seasonally, so there's always something new to try. There are classic dishes that stick around year after year too. My current favorite is the Short Rib Benedict (pictured). Before the Benedict, my favorite was the Breakfast Burrito.  Fair prices: You get what you pay for. Sure, breakfasts at Square are a few dollars more than some of the local diners nearby. But at Square you get golden-colored yolks, fresh greens, and local ingredients.  Great service: I've always had friendly and attentive servers. Plus, many servers have worked there for years so they are experts. It does get very busy on weekends, but I've learned to time my visit before or after the big brunch rush.  Coffee: Their coffee is \"bottomless,\" which means you can get a free hot or cold refill to go!",

If the weather had been a tad nicer, I would have insisted we sit outside as there is just enough room on the sidewalks to eat and for people to walk by.  Food came out quickly ( I had Cinnamon protein-packed pancakes) and I really enjoyed the vibe of the staff.  There was art on the wall available for purchase - I liked that a lot.

Like before 8 am early or you will be waiting.  The quaint interior has maybe 10 tables, but remember breakfast is quick, so turnover usually is fast.   2.  Listen to the server. There are always specials.  And the specials are always awesome. (as I post a picture of the brussel sprout hash ---menu item. Sorry :( ) 3.  Don't get overwhelmed with the menu.  It is slammed packed of breakfast-y goodness, sweet, savory, heavy, lite,  meat, vegan, you name it.  I ordered one pancake once (it wasn't on the menu) 4.  Take in the surroundings.  The tables are close, so you get the warm feeling of an overpacked living room on Christmas morning surrounded by your close and distant relatives.    From the mugs to the happy employees to piping hot coffee, Square is a great local joint.    Don't be a square and get there.  In the words of Huey Lewis \"It's hip to be Square.\"  I am done now.",

The place is bright-colored with limited seating outside.  The seating are also tight fit inside, but it's typical for downtown restaurant. I love all the flavor lattes they have and many unique brunch items on the menu.  Between the 4 of us, we ordered smoked salmon omelet, lemon ricotta pancakes, Brussels sprout hash, and chicken mushroom crepes.  I was IMPRESSED on how fast the food came out AND they were all very good!  We also tried the Banaoffee (banana flavor latte) and churro latte - both were yummy but on the sweet side.  I wish I live closer so I can try more things on their menu! On a side note - there are 2 unisex bathrooms - both with changing table AND a little bench for the kiddos to use to wash hands (or sit on the potty).  Very kid-friendly.  Love it.  :)",

Plus having a son who is allergic to basic breakfast staples (eggs, bananas, soy, dairy), it's nice to go to a restaurant with multiple vegan options that are kid friendly (my 14 month old ate vegan pancakes, sausage, & a fruit cup).   Parking is always hit or miss since it's street parking, but we lucked up this time and got a spot directly in front. The restaurant is very family friendly with CLEAN high chairs available for smaller children. The staff is always very friendly and accommodating. One of my favorite sports to eat breakfast.",

    "text": "Square is great!  I'm a vegetarian, so having the soy sausage, tofu, and meatless dishes available is wonderful.  I've never had a bad meal there.  I also love that they typically offer a fill up and to-go cup for your coffee before you leave.  I was recently there with my son, who loves it as well (very kid friendly), and I got one of their signature dishes - the Brussels sprouts over cheesy polenta, with a soft boiled egg on top, and some soy sausage as a replacement for ham.  OMG - best.breakfast.ever!  I ate the whole, HUGE, dish.  I will definitely be back for that.  I think the two big drawbacks to Square are these: 1.  A bit pricey.  This isn't your typical corner diner.  Even though we live close, we only go once in a while.  Its a great place to take guests from out-of-town, or to go for a special treat.  However, going on a weekly basis might break the budget a bit.  2.  Seating.  Most greasy spoons have horrible seating though, right?  Especially during peak times (Saturday and Sunday mornings).  People are practically sitting on top of each other, and wait staff has to do magic tricks in order to get orders to tables.  This is annoying, but its a popular place.  If you're looking for a quiet breakfast on a Sunday, Square is not for you.",

    "text": "UPDATE 3/17/17: Ate at Square for the first time today for the first time since I've had increased dietary restriction. Our waitress had great knowledge of the menu's specifics and was willing to make alterations for me if needed. My only complaint is that I asked for no onion in my scramble, and there were two tiny bits of onions in the scramble... I know I'm being picky here, but it could have been an issue for me if I did not see spot them and ate the onion. I know Square will read this review and take extra care in the future. Regardless, I was content with the meal I received and it made me and my body happy! Keep it up, Square Cafe.  Perhaps my favorite breakfast place in Pittsburgh, Square Cafe is a delicious, family friendly brunch and breakfast location. The menu is diverse, appealing to more traditional American grease breakfast fans, but also to the more health conscious and dietarily restricted. Square Cafe even manages to successfully craft dishes that fuse traditional breakfast items like eggs and bacon with less traditional items like brussel sprouts and braised leeks (try the Brussel Sprout Hash).  They usually have two special dishes at a time, and switch them up every few weeks. One tends to be an egg centered dish, and the other a griddle pastry dish. They once had a delicious \"Green Eggs and Ham\" special that featured basil pesto with eggs and ham. I had no idea that the two would mix so perfectly! If you vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, or have other dietary restrictions, fear not: the menu has items for you, and the staff is more than willing to accommodate your needs.   Waits can be long, but the surrounding area of Regent Square has pretty neighborhoods to explore on foot as you wait in queue, or feel free to get one of their assorted beverages in their signature clay mugs as you wait!",

The atmosphere was awesome, with brightly colored walls adorned with locally painted artwork. The square-shaped coffee cups also added to the unique experience - especially since their coffee was fantastic.   They don't poach or baste eggs, so my wife ordered scrambled egg whites, which were covered in grease. I ordered an omelet with ham, salsa, and their \"King's Pearl\" cheese, which we were told was similar to feta, but actually was more like ricotta. I'll be honest, I hate ricotta cheese, so I wasn't a fan of it. I understand that some people may like it, but it just wasn't for me. I can't blame them for that.   What I can blame the kitchen for though is that I asked twice for salsa on the side, because I didn't want my eggs smothered in it, and then we both asked for our toast well done, explaining that we like it really crispy. When the food came, the bread was barely toasted and the eggs were covered in salsa. It would have taken too long to ask for the bread to be toasted more, so we just ate it.   I hate giving low ratings, but we just weren't very happy with our breakfast. I don't like to be all negative, so I will say the waitress was very friendly, the coffee was great, and the inside atmosphere was awesome. Other than that, I can't justify going back.",

We were seated inside and someone was over right away to take our drink order.  My husband had a sugar free vanilla latte which he enjoyed very much.   He had the bacon avocado omlette and subbed mixed greens for the toast and hash browns.  He really enjoyed it and the bite that I had was delicious and chockfull of toppings.  He did think it was strange that the avocado was not incorporated during the cooking, but I prefered it that way since I don't like warm avocado.   I had the short rib eggs benedict.  This was absolutely out of this world.  The hollindaise actulaly tasted light which is difficult to do considering all of the delicious fat in it.  The short ribs were plentefully and were beautifully accompnied by perfectly cooked eggs.    Like I said can't wait to go back and try more of the menu, but it might be hard for me not to order that delicious eggs benedict again.",

Maybe because it's in Regent Square, an area that reminds me of the old nabe in Brooklyn.  Or maybe it's the coffee served in the square mugs.  Whatever the reason, I always look forward to a Square Cafe meal.  Last time I was there, I had the root vegetable hash and eggs.  Fantastic.  When I'm there, I always wonder what a Square Cafe dinner menu would look like.  But that's just me daydreaming.  I already know it would be great.  Love you Square Cafe!",

I have absurd food allergies, all with anaphylactic symptoms, so I carry my Epi-pen on me at all times as if it were a part of my body. At Square Cafe, I achieved what I would call the perfect dining out experience for breakfast. They are sensitive to dietary concerns, allergies, and intolerances and their menu is unique and offers up some delectable options for everyone. I devoured the goat cheese, sun dried tomato omelet scramble and sipped on an almond milk latte. Both were a True delight for my taste buds.   Pros: -Almond milk option for coffee -Delicious food and drinks -Blankets if you sit outside and get cold -Outdoor seating   Cons: -They charge extra $$ for almond milk, however, it is not posted on their menu or their blackboard above the barista bar anywhere. -Very tight indoor seating, cramped location -If you are going with a group, if your full party is not there, they will seat others before you even if you put in your name.",

I dont mean that in a bad way, as they sure know their target market.   That being said, it was OK. I had a Chorizo sort of frittata thing. Chorizo can generally make anything awesome, but the meal was fairly bland. Pumpkin pancakes were decent, though I can really make them just as good out of some mix at home.  This place was packed, though we were seated very quickly. The service was quite good.   You can take my review with a grain of sea salt, as I am a breakfast snob. Call the whambulance.",

    "text": "Over-rated.  I was in town for the weekend and wanted to have a nice vegan brunch before heading home so by the power of Yelp, I ended up at Square Cafe. I was honestly torn between Square Cafe and the hot dog joint across the street, and I should have had a hot dog.   As others have noted, there's a wait. But I'm patient. I was seated in about 20 minutes and got a cup of joe with almond milk really quickly. My fiance ordered a fancy coffee (something about a unicorn?) and that arrived a short time later. Maybe it was our seat location or maybe it was because I looked like someone who likes getting jostled around, but servers kept bumping into me the entire time we were seated. That was kind of a buzzkill.  For some reason, it was also a million degrees in the restaurant. I was super uncomfortable. Equally un-awesome was my meal. I ordered the tofu scramble. I counted 3 pieces of mushrooms in it. However, there were lots of undercooked Brussels sprouts. To add to my misery, our waitress keyed in the wrong order for my fiance, and my food was whisked away while they remade his meal. Then they brought back my lukewarm food and his side of flavorless home fries. I patiently waited to eat my meal until my fiance's food arrived, and was just underwhelmed by it. I slathered on some hot sauce, but that didn't even do much. He did like his white bean skillet, so that was the highlight of our dining experience.   Overall, I had a mediocre meal and wouldn't come back. There are other options for vegan brunch in the Burgh, and I'm guessing they have to be better? Right?",

(Greg Brady voice)   Square Cafe was on point in every regard. My colleague (the one and only Rachel C, pancake master) arrived around 930 and were quickly equipped with waters and appropriate hot beverages. My coffee (which I needed desperately) was refilled graciously and often. We ordered up the lovely oatmeal pancakes, tricking ourselves into thinking they were \"healthy.\" Maybe slightly moreso than say...Snickers Bar pancakes, but these bad boys were very decadent, topped with mucho butter and pecans and peaches. I mean, really? REALLY!  We also split the Ranchero Omelette for some protein, which was fluffy, full of cheese and flavorful. Only complaint was homemade salsa was a bit runny, and wet eggs ick me out. Still though, I persevered.   I loved it so much I hung out an hour after breakfast at a table outside sipping a half chai/half coffee at a sweet sunny spot.   Then I left FLYING. Whatever is in that coffee...works. Whew.

Most of the time they'll bring her over some water to drink - very nice.  The choices as far as food goes are great, and the coffee is (almost) always very good!  I'm a vegetarian, so it's really nice to have a place that is veggie-friendly with lots of choices (that's also very rare).  And the breakfast potatoes are AWESOME!  The only reason I give Square Cafe four stars instead of five is because of their prices.  They are pretty overpriced actually.  I almost always get the same thing (Veggie Overload Omelet - yum!), but it's painful to have to pay over $2 extra to add cheese to it... sigh... but I still do it.

    "text": "Quite frankly the worst Eggs Benedict I've had in my life. Eggs were fried instead of poached, hardly any hollandaise sauce, basically just a drizzle. And unbelievably it came with lettuce, soggy wet lettuce to be exact....for breakfast? Then the kicker was they charged me extra for home fries.  It had the potential to be one of the best because I was excited about the short rib, sadly was the opposite, won't be back here again I'm afraid.",

    "text": "So I've only been to Square Cafe once...and maybe I had a bad experience or just chose the wrong items, but I doubt I'm gonna be heading back ever again.  I am NOT snobby about my food...especially breakfast food (if you give me decently cooked bacon & eggs, I'm a happy camper), but this food was severely lacking.    I ordered the Fennel Sausage & Ricotta Frittata, which was clearly not cooked to order.  It was rubbery and lukewarm.  It looked like it was cooked the day before, sliced up into individual orders, and heated in a microwave.  The WORST part, however, was the \"side\" it came with....a pile of lettuce (described as \"mixed greens\" on the menu).  Seriously, just a pile of lettuce.  No dressing...no additional veggies...nothing but a pile of lettuce. A guy next to me ordered the \"Chickpea & Tofu Hash\", who seemed like the type of person that might enjoy eating a pile of nondescript lettuce...but no, he just pushed that crap to the edge of the plate (like a kid who's trying to fool his parents into thinking he ate some of his veggies).  I mean, c'mon!!! I just paid $9.50 for a slice of day old frittata and a pile of lettuce?!?!  My boyfriend had the the Leek, Pancetta, and Mozzarella Omelet, which was OK enough.  It at least came with homefries (and not the lettuce), but they looked like they were heated from a frozen bag...nothing special, and definitely not worth the $9.50 price.  The coffee and service were good (only reason why I give 2 stars).  Maybe we just ordered the wrong things.  Maybe if I were vegeterian/vegan, I'd love this place.  I just do not understand why people wait here for hours on the weekends to overpay for subpar breakfast food.  I'd much rather wait in line at Pamelas and pay less!!",

    "text": "We went at noon on a Monday and there was no wait (it was also 4 degrees or something). I've been here a few times before and I have always been pleased with what I have gotten.  Today, though, I wish I got what my husband ordered!  He got the Tahini Chickpea Burger with feta cheese and olive tapenade.  It was really delicious.  I think the patty was a little bland on its own, but the feta and olive tapenade really brought it all together.  My veggie overload omelette was pretty ordinary, but I always love the home fries.  They had this cayenne pepper saltiness that make them very crave worthy.  Good atmosphere, nice menu.  It's a great place to go when I happen to be in the area.",

    "text": "I ate here this past weekend for brunch with three other dining companions.  We arrived around 10:30 and the place was packed forcing us into a bit of a wait.  The restaurant is fairly quaint with vividly colored walls and a bar on one side.  For brunch I decided upon having the andouille sausage with jalapeno jam with a cup of coffee.  The coffee came out and was not that great but was in a very cool glazed pottery cup which they seemed to also be selling.  Thankfully the meal was much better than the coffee with a big piece of andouille sausage, two eggs over easy and grits with some jalapeno jam dabbled over the sausage and onto the plate.  The jalapeno jam was not what I was expecting as it did not have any spice that I could detect but it was still delicious with a somewhat sweet taste.  I ended up mixing all of my food together which gave it all a great taste.  I was also able to try the shrimp and crab omelet which had a nice remoulade but a bit too fishy of a taste for my liking.  The Brussels sprouts and bacon hash ordered by another dining companion looked very good and I am looking forward to coming back in order to try it.  The bottom line for me is that this place is great and I will definitely be back in the future.  It is a unique place which has some great food combinations that I have not seen elsewhere.",
