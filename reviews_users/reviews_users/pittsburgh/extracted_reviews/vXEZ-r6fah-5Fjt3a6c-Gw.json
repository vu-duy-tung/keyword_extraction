To me, the menu isn't all that great mainly because I come here just for the finale... aka the cheesecake! Lol.   However, recently I tried to Shrimp & Chicken Gumbo and omg, it's delicious! I also love the bread that they give you at the beginning. Overall it's an OK restaurant to come if you're around the SS area and/or craving cheesecake! :)",

They seem to use expeditors to deliver food, so it came out hot.  My Cuban sandwich was good.  It had the usual pork, ham, cheese and tasty pickle.  Had the sweet potato fries as the side that were your standard but good sweet potato fries.  The SkinnyLisious menu had some interesting choices.  The Shrimp taco looked good, and the person that ordered it, was not about to share.  They received a really nice vegetable salad that had a somewhat sweet flavored dressing that was really tasty.",

The Cheesecake Factory is one of my favorite food-places. I am dying to know the recipe of an appetizer \"Sweet Corn Tamale Cakes\". It is incredibly delicious. Sometimes I just get this dish and cheesecake on the dessert and I`m full.   This place is really busy on weekends. You should be able to wait a twenty or thirty minutes but it is worth it. The waiter stuff is very friendly and they are serving very fast.   I have never been dissapointed with the Cheesecake Factory and highly recommend this place:)",

    "text": "I came here last Wed. to get a 50% off slice of cheesecake, since they were running a promo for Nat'l Cheesecake Day.  I opted for takeout since I wanted to sit by the river to eat my cheesecake, and things were a bit hectic due to the promo.  I decided to try the new lemon meringue cheesecake, since I was in the mood for something on the lighter side.  Due to the crowd, it took about 5 min. for the cheesecake to come up, during which time I used the restroom (to the left of the take out counter).  Though I've never dined in in this location, the dining space was quite cavernous.  When my cheesecake came up, it was served to me in a bag.  I asked the woman serving me if a fork and napkins were had been included, and she said they were.  Despite this, when I sat down and removed the contents, no napkins were in the bag.  (This wasn't a huge deal, however, since I'm not a big napkin user--on the other hand, missing the fork would have necessitated having to go back.)  When I opened the box containing the cheesecake, it was slightly squished on one side due to how it had been loaded into the bag, and some of the meringue stuck to the side of the box.  Speaking of which, the meringue application wasn't nearly as polished as it looks in the official photo, and for a cheesecake inspired by lemon meringue pie, I was expecting it to have quite a bit more volume--as it were, it was a thin, flimsy foam.  The filling, on the other hand, was quite creamy and delicious, with lots of lemony flavor.  I appreciated the garnishes of candied lemon peel on the whipped cream that comes with the cheesecake and of mint leaves, which I ate and chewed on, respectively.  Overall, despite that its visual appeal left something to be desired, I enjoyed this piece of cheesecake, esp. for $4.25, and would recommend it.  In fact, I'd be willing to award 4 stars, but for the appearance of the slice and the lack of sufficient meringue.  3.5 stars.",

I always opt for the tomato basil pasta. I've had the meatloaf (great!), ahi(tuna) tar tare (fabulous!), Godiva cheesecake (descendant), cosmopolitan (strong!). If you and your dining guests are indecisive on where to eat... this is the place to go! Everything you can possibly think of if listed on the menu in some form.   The waiter we had this time around seemed new. He was very friendly, but needed more experience.   My only real complaint is the wait and the reservation guidelines. Basically, you have to reserve before 11am (if you're a large group), or wait in the main area for hours before getting a table after 7PM on a weekend. This is a major restaurant to go to in the Pittsburgh area apparently. If you go on a weekend, I would suggest getting there between 5:30 and 6:30 to avoid waiting forever.",

I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich and I figured that since I was going to take a hit between that and a slice of cheesecake, I should get a salad with balsamic vinaigrette as my side. The sandwich came out and it was the greasiest thing I have ever eaten. The bun tasted like it had been deep fried and then soaked in oil overnight - completely unnecessary. To my astonishment, my salad came out with a cream-based balsamic vinaigrette. There's just no reason to put cream in everything. That being said, the service was spectacular and my slice of coconut cheesecake was ridiculously good.   Overall - great service and cheesecake, insanely unhealthy food. Still a good place to go, but I would probably stick to dessert next time.",

I'm a big fan of the avocado eggroll app, so when we come here that's always a given. I've you've never had it, I really recommend it! It's one of the best things on their menu and the dipping sauce is delicious. I'm hungry just thinking about them!  I ordered the grilled fish tacos as my entree and they were pretty bland. There was no real flavorful sauce or even strong citrus flavor. They were fine, but I wouldn't order them again.   Overall, it's a decent place to sit outside for drinks and some cheesecake. The atmosphere is nice and it wasn't too loud.",

I work close to this location in South Side Works and really enjoy going here for lunch and cheesecake. However, I think their dinner entrees are a bit overpriced and underwhelming, and since the wait times can get long, I wouldn't personally get dinner from here.  Based on lunch and dinner, I would only rate this restaurant three stars. However, I think The Cheesecake Factory deserves four stars for the environment and desserts. I've enjoyed the majority of the cheesecakes that I've tried since first going here eight years ago, including -- Oreo Dream Extreme, Ultimate Red Velvet, Godiva, White Chocolate Raspberry, Adam's Peanut Butter Cup, Craig's Crazy Carrot Cake, etc. I highly recommend dropping by The Cheesecake Factory around 9-10pm on the weekend to eat cheesecake, have coffee or a drink, and hang out with friends.",

I usually end up going in pretty late, but they never make us feel rushed or like we're keeping them there late. Whether I sit at the bar or we grab a booth, service is pretty quick and friendly!  My favorite drink is the Strawberry Creamsicle that comes with a fresh strawberry on top [the menu doesn't tell you, but it has whipped cream on top too]. I still eat like I'm 5, so it's always nachos or chicken for me and occasionally steak. The food can be hit or miss, honestly. I've gotten some pretty dry chicken and once my friend sent back 2 different dishes. I really don't prefer to send things back, but I on one occasion I did send back my mid-rare steak that came out so well done that it was hard for me to chew (nbd). The manger comped it for me and was sincerely super nice!  If you read my other reviews you'll notice that I prefer the divey, down-home types of places.

    "text": "One does not simply walk into the Cheesecake Factory!   The reasons are twofold. First, the columns look like the eye of Sauron (see picture). Second, the wait for dinner is always at least 20 minutes. On a weekend night, expect to wait about 45 minutes to an hour.   Boy and I attempted to go to the CF on a Friday evening and were given an hour plus wait time. We decided to go to the Claddagh instead (but that's another review). We went back on Sunday evening, and it was still very crowded. We waited for about 20 minutes at the bar.  My biggest peeve with the Cheesecake Factory, however, is the menu. It's as thick as a Dickens novel! In social science, they call the weariness one gets from having too many choices \"analysis paralysis.\" I felt this in abundance.   Finally, I settled on a turkey burger with a side salad and my very lovely boyfriend chose the meatloaf.  We split an appetizer of nachos.   The nachos were ok, but they were quite bland despite it being topped with jalapenos. I enjoyed my turkey burger and salad, but my ever-so-handsome boyfriend didn't like his meatloaf much.  I think they snuck some mushrooms into it. I found it to be overly salty.   *Boy grew very upset and outwardly showed his displeasure at having mushrooms in his meatloaf. He hopped onto the table and screamed \"My PRECIOUS meatloaf!\" A waiter shortly stopped by to assuage the angry customer, but boy bit his finger off and took the ring he was wearing.  Using this one ring, boy was now free to move invisibly about the kitchen, removing every mushroom in sight. After he had completed this task, he destroyed the evil ring in a bubbling pot of artichoke dip.  Some eagles came and took us back to the South Side, having strangely been absent for the first two parts of our dining experience.*  Oh, we also shared some Snickers cheesecake. It wasn't anything to write home about.",

Their menu is super extensive and it's fantastic that they offer a \"Skinnylicious\" menu for people like me who don't want to eat a 3,000 calories meal followed by a 1,200 slice of cheesecake. Their wine by the glass list is laughable, but their full bar makes up for it. My favorite thing to eat is the Ahi Tuna Carpaccio (very sushi-like) and, of course, the cheesecake. Service is always really good (we typically sit at the bar) and fast and any special requests are respected without question (e.g. sauce on the side) or complaint. Despite being a massive restaurant, it is usually packed to the gills with diners, but they turn tables quickly enough that as long as you don't have a large party, wait times are kept to minimum. They will also validate your parking (2 hours) for any of the Southside Works garages. If Cheesecake Factory wants a 5th star, they need to bring back the White Chocolate Blueberry cheesecake (why they discontinued my favorite cheesecake in the first place is beyond me).",

Finished with some classic strawberry cheesecake which never disappoints. My only gripe about this company is that they use canned whipped cream. Like come on, make that shit fresh or buy something better than Ready Whip.",

The egg roll was surprisingly very delicious. I got their newest (?) cheesecake, the salted caramel cheesecake. It was on the sweet side, so if that's what you're going for I'd give it a try. Our server was more than happy to give us advice on our entrees. We came on a Friday during Valentines weekend for a friend's birthday. At first she forgot to sing happy birthday for our friend, but it worked out in the end. It was quite busy, but we got seated within 20-30 minutes. We had a party of 7, we sat in a 6 person booth and they added a seat to the end.  It took about 20 minutes for us to receive our main entrees. Thank you Stella for giving us great service .",

This location is situated smack dab in the middle of Southside Works and has a classy kinda feel to it. It's beautiful inside and I love how some of the seating is very intimate. The service here is always great which leads me to believe whoever is running this one knows what they are doing and they're employees are happy...it shows.   The food was soooo good. My order of chicken piccata had that burst of fresh lemon and caper sauce with a side of angel hair. The chicken was moist and tender and absorbed the light sauce well.  On a final note, get here early on a Saturday night because the wait is LONG. No reservations are accepted on the weekends. With that said, if you have good company to keep your attention, the wait is a non-issue :)",

    "text": "Wowza. Ok. So I came here with a reservation for 13 because we were celebrating a work milestone. Seriously, 13 people! I commend the Cheesecake Factory for being so open, welcoming, and accommodating to us. I could not even remember the last time that I came here. I believe it was about 2 or 3 years ago because we came after my friend picked out a wedding dress to celebrate. I am really surprised after this last visit that we don't come more often. Granted, the South Side area that it is in sometimes the parking can be annoying, so maybe that is it? I look forward to coming back here though!  We all looked over the menu before we got there. With this place the menu is about the size of a novel so you have to at least glance at it to get oriented to what you might want to eat.   Appetizers:  EGGROLL SAMPLER: A Variety of All of Our Eggrolls with Avocado, Tex Mex, Crispy Cuban and Firecracker Salmon.: YUM. I got to try the firecracker salmon and the avocado. The avocado was amazing. Seriously, and that dipping sauce, totally on point. This was a nice sampler and each of the eggrolls were cut into two so we got to try more than one of the rolls. I liked the sauces as much as I liked the eggrolls!  GUACAMOLE MADE-TO-ORDER:Ripe Avocado, Onion, Tomato, Chiles, Cilantro and Fresh Lime. Served with Tortilla Chips, Salsa and Sour Cream.: Wowza, this guacamole was hot! The jalapenos in the guacamole were spicy! I mean, I liked it but dang it had some fire. I liked that the plate came with a lot of chips. I hate it when you get guacamole or even salsa and you have to keep on asking for more chips in order for the table to finish the dish, small annoyance but still.   Entree:  CHICKEN BELLAGIO:Crispy Coated Chicken Breast over Basil Pasta and Parmesan Cream Sauce Topped with Prosciutto and Arugula Salad: OMG.YES.YES.YES. I wanted to go with another chicken dish but the waitress described it as, \"eh\" and the Chicken Bellagio, my second choice, she described as, \"favorite thing on the menu\". I had to then of course pick the Chicken Bellagio. I am so happy I did. First, the dinner portion was huge. The chicken came in two pounded out thin breasts so I just put one and half the pasta into a box right away so I wouldn't be tempted to eat it. This dish was banging. Seriously. The Parmesan cream sauce was delish and the basil pasta was not overwhelming at all. It was a very subtle flavor. The chicken was pounded thin and was a crisp perfection. I loved the salad that topped the dish. It added some live green to the dish that complemented everything really well. YUM. The only thing is, the prosciutto was in strips. I wish that it was cut up maybe just a little. It was hard to cut through, as prosciutto usually is so smaller pieces might have made the dish a bit easier to eat.  I did not eat any dessert because after the fresh bread at the table, the apps, and the dinner, I could not fit another thing into my belly.   I know that I am usually not the biggest fan of chain restaurants but  this was a great experience and the food was AWESOME. I look forward to my next trip to the Cheesecake Factory.",

Otherwise you can't enjoy the main entree as much! I ordered the Louisiana Chicken Pasta, which was not overly spicy. It could have benefited from a bit more spice, but that is my personal preference.   The only thing preventing me from coming here frequently is the price. Otherwise, I would!",

I only dyed a little because I had to save room for the delicious peppermint cheesecake that had candy canes crushed up on top! Yum! FYI everyone on Saturday they will not validate parking because the parking is 3 dollars on Saturday.. kinda annoying that I just spent $30.00 on dinner and you won't validate my 3.00 because it's Saturday.. but you would if it was Friday.

Cheesecake Factory!!!!!!!!!!!  You need to get your shit together in south side, please.  Get everyone on the same page there.  The rules change constantly.  We are there without incident on 7/28 on the patio with our dog.  We were courteous and sat away from other diners.  Then today we attempt this again and told NO dogs allowed on patio hmmmmm.  So we went and spent our money where we are appreciate, at the delicious and always fabulous Waffles Incaffeinated.  If anyone wants a great meal at south side Waterworks, Waffles Inc never fails and always makes you feel welcome.",

And thanks to recommendations given by yelpers, the mango key lime cheesecake didn't let me down. I love every food with mango in it. Even though I was told the cake here are too sweet for low sweet threshold Chinese people, this one I tried is bearable.  My friend ordered the toasted pear and blue cheese flat bread which looks like a mini pizza. The flavor of blue cheese was not that sharp and salty as I imagined, probably neutralized by sweet pears. The distinct flavors getting together is unique, and it really deserves a try.  Also I tried their salads, nothing special other than the beets, I love their purple color and the light sweet flavor.",

    "text": "I've been to this particular Cheesecake Factory maybe 5 or 6 times now.  I love this place regardless that it's a chain because it's one of the higher quality bang for the buck type of restaurants.  This one's a bit different in that it's a standalone building in what seems to be the centerpiece of Southside Works with a mini water fountain type plaza in the front.  We came on a Sunday around 3:30pm this time around and there wasn't really a wait at all.  Originally we were just going to have dessert but I'm not really one for sweets so I ended up getting my favorite dish which is the hibachi steak.    The Cheesecake Factory's menu is crazy and has a wide variety of things to choose from but as of late and for as often as we go I always seem to gravitate towards this same dish.  It looked a little different this time around as the steak although still sliced, wasn't scattered and was pretty much left as a whole.  The asparagus were smaller cut spears than previously which seemed to be about 2 or 3 whole spears tempura battered and fried.  The mashed potatoes seemed the same as before but with much more wasabi butter as usual which I did not mind at all.  The steak is sliced, with sprouts and mushrooms in a sugar and soy type of sauce.  Delicious!  Overall this is my favorite dish and while I've had many at many Cheesecake Factories all over the continent this is still my fall back menu item and I love it.  Everybody that has ever had a taste of my dish it pretty much became their favorite dish too OR they said it was amazing.    The service at this particular Cheesecake and pretty much all for that matter is always great.  The floor here much like many I've been to before as well seems slippery, greasy or whatever.  I don't know what it is but if you have deck shoes here it could be dangerous!    They pretty much all have the same decor and lighting, the foods basically all the same and so is the service.  Still as good as it gets for medium priced sit down chains and I'm looking forward to when they finally come up to Toronto in the near future.    Wifi would be nice considering people come from all over to eat here and the place is large.",

    "text": "For sophistication's sake, I want to give The Cheesecake Factory 3 stars, but let's be honest . . . I love this restaurant.   This location is great because when waiting 3+ hrs you can walk around REI or stare at shooting water in the southside works while you wait. There's a lot of great shops to meander around while trying to kill time. A con, however, is they still use the taser-looking bricks instead of texting you. (You guys should fix that.)   Inside decor. Lavish. Unique. Kind of gaudy. But I like it. Honestly, you look up and wonder if you're in the Sistine Chapel. Brilliant. Who paints that? And more importantly, you cannot help but wonder if your booth is housing a dinosaur egg or if youre eating under the menacing eye of Saruman (if you have no clue what I'm taking about, you cannot unsee it when you do.)   Both options are exciting.   A part of me truly judges the person who says they don't like The Cheesecake Factory. Why? Saying you don't like The Cheesecake Factory is like saying you don't like food - because the menu covers every discipline of food making. Honestly, the thing is an encyclopedia. If you are indecisive, you need to look at the menu and have a game plan before entering. Otherwise, you will be there all night just trying to decide. If you don't know what to get, I suggest one of two options (and really both if you're me).   1. Order the Crusted Chicken Romano. It may not be the most adventurous option, but I am willing to say it is the best. Delicious. Massive. Caloric.   2. Just keep eating the refillable bread baskets. They serve a wheat that is to die for. *Lifehack: when the bowl of butter comes out, grab two of those packets and place one behind each knee - otherwise you might as well try to spread a hardened slab of concrete on your bread.   If you can eat all your food, you may want to (scratch that), always order Cheesecake. They're all good and there are about 7,000 options. I love the raspberry white chocolate, and I usually order it to go.   Southside parking on the street is free at random times, so make sure you check the meters. If you don't mind walking a couple blocks, Sarah St. will save you from paying for parking if you are crazy about that like I am. If you're not, they have multiple parking garages in the area AND a valet (they used to even validate parking garage tickets, so look into that!).   Cheesecake Factory... quantity, quantity, good quality, and always an experience. Check. It. Out.",

I went with a friend here last Friday spur of the moment and she called ahead to see what the wait was. They told her over the phone there was no wait and when she showed up before me like 10-15 minutes later the wait was all of a sudden 40 minutes long. What. Thankfully, she knew someone and she was able to get a table quicker.  I got there when she was already seated and the crowd was out of control. It seems there's no rhyme or reason to the throng of people because everyone stands in a big huddle and sometimes blocks the entrance. Annoying. We had a nice man as our waiter and his customer service was fabulous. We weren't ignored and he was prompt in coming back to fill water and get our orders. I loved the bread that comes out while we waited for our food. We both ordered salads - for me a Luau salad and for my friend a Cobb. Who orders salads at Cheesecake Factory, right? Ha.  When they came out, it was like 2-3 portions on one plate. My salad has a variety of flavors and ingredients. It was really, really good. In the middle of the salad there were these two flat pieces of something crunchy. It tasted like it was coated with something sweet and sesame seeds. I took a few bites of it and scooped my salad with it. The customer service and food (enough for a good amount of leftovers!) was great! I don't prefer the crowd and wait times though.",

    "text": "I organized a \"post-holiday\" party for a group of my co-workers at the Cheesecake Factory. I had called to asked about reservations for a Sunday night at 6 PM. Unfortunately they weren't able to take reservations but said that during the afternoon, a wait time for a party of 10 was an hour and a half. I went down an hour early to put our name in and a manager came to tell me the wait time was an hour and a half still. Luckily for us the wait was only an hour and we were able to seat at 6 PM! While we waited, my friend and I sat at the bar and had drinks. I had a frozen passion fruit margarita and April had a peach Bellini. I wasn't a fan of my drink, but I liked April's! For dinner, I had the barbecue ranch chicken salad and chocolate chip cookie dough cheesecake. Both delicious! The gathering was a success and I appreciated the friendly hostesses, general manager and waitress that we had during our dinner!",

Find a friend and I bet you they have their go to cheesecake. My favorite is the turtle cheesecake hands down. Sometimes when I'm meeting friends here and I know I won't have room for the cheesecake I just take it to go. Also the avocado egg rolls are so good that I don't trust anyone that says otherwise. Me and my friends have a stare down over the last one. I also appreciate good service. Not once have I had a bad experience at The Cheesecake Factory and I appreciate it thar because it's just as much about the experience as it is the food.",

The service is impeccable as well as the food especially the nachos with the jalapenos on the side. However, we recently switched things up and got the four cheese pasta. Definitely not a fan. It was missing flavor and I could only count 1 cheese not 4 without including parmesan on the side. Besides that salted caramel cheesecake never falls to end the dinner fantastically. Will be returning soon. Just will not be getting the four cheese pasta. Highly recommend taking the cheesecake home because after a meal like this your stomach may not feel good. It is so worth it though.",

Yes, it's on south side, but if you plan on doing more then going to AE, Sur La Table or Houghbrah House there's not to much to do. There used to be tons of shops/ other restaurants right in the surrounding blocks but since then has seen a down turn.  It's quite a far walk to the \"real\" south side ( all the bars) but I suppose in the summer months you could make it happen. The food is the same food you'd get at any other location, good size, good taste for the price.  Since this is the only location in downtown Pittsburgh it does get quite busy, so put your name on the list and have a drink in the bar area while you wait! The high tops in the bar are first come first serve, so elbow your way into one! :)",

    "text": "Why does everyone hate on the Cheesecake Factory? I like privately owned, farm to table, tapas as much as the next food snob, but I like The Cheesecake Factory. And a lot of other (maybe not food snobs) do too. How do I know this? Try getting a table anytime and see how long the wait is. Try getting a table on a Friday/Saturday or even a seat at the bar OR even a seat in their waiting area and it'll take an hour (at least). So that's annoying, but you can also make reservations or do take out. And it's not like you weren't warned.   Anyway, I like the food. I've enjoyed most of the appetizers and entrees I've had. I've also had maybe 20 Oreo cheesecake slices in the last three years so hopefully that tells you something about the (Oreo) cheesecake. Occasionally someone I'm with doesn't like their food, but that's not typically what happens.  Besides the wait, the service occasionally leaves something to be desired. My last interaction was over the phone for take out and it was pretty good, except this awkward moment where I said \"can I have the Americana burger sub a veggie patty?\" And the lady on the other end goes \"do you just want the veggie burger?\" And in my head I was an a**hole and responded with 'No, that's why I asked for the Americana burger.' Externally, I realized she thought I might have missed the veggie option on the menu (or maybe they try to discourage substitutions) and responded with a proper \"No thanks, I would like the Americana burger with a veggie patty.\" And, if anyone is wondering- I've had the Americana burger with a veggie patty maybe four times now and have been satisfied with my choice of entree and restaurant each time.   The well drinks are also good, but keep in mind if you order a specialty cocktail it will have at least half the amount of alcohol you expect for twice the price.",

    "text": "Within the last few months I went twice while visiting Pittsburgh.  The first time I had the Miso Salmon, miso glazed salmon on a bed of brown rice with sugar snap peas.  Absolutely excellent...except that the dish contained only 5, maybe 6, snap peas.  I didn't get my veggie serving in on that meal.  The second time I had the Chicken Marsala over Bow Tie Pasta.  The pasta was gummy and hard...like they only cooked it part way in prep and hoped it would cook fully after  tossing it in the pan and putting it under the hot lights -- which it was because the top layer of pasta was hardened.  The flavor was good, but there was not enough sauce.  The sauce was overly greasy, too.   It came with four tender, pounded thin, chicken breast pieces, about the 4 or 5 inches in diameter.   I ate half of it, carefully saving a lot of mushrooms (button and shitake) because they gave the most flavor to the dish plus two of the four chicken pieces, so I could have some take home in my hotel.  However, when I opened the take home container the next night, I had only one chicken piece and, literally, one slice each of button and shitake.  WTF?  Where the heck did the rest of meal go to???    Because of this and the loud back room (steerage, I joked, to my companions) where  they seat the undesirables -- drunken parties, families with children, teen dates, and underdressed folk (which we were because we had just come from the airport on both occasions) I gave only two stars.  I would have given one if not for the awesome salmon (which I ordered rare and they actually obliged!)",

    "text": "The main reason I am giving this restaurant three out of five stars is because of their wait times. The wait times here are absolutely atrocious and they do NOT take reservations which I find absolutely ridiculous. It's their company policy that there is not wait times, however, this location is the only Cheesecake Factory in Pittsburgh and gets too much attention and they should start doing it. I like to take my 62 year old mother here and she does not want to wait over an hour to get a seat when on medication and with a bad hip. We came here once before a concert to to see the Transiberian Orchestra. They told us the wait would be 45 minutes and we waited 1 hour and 15 minutes and eventually left. The second time was today, after the failed to take my reservation I walk in and the place was packed like sardines. I didn't even bother asking how long of a wait, as it was probably over an hour. My moms birthday dinner was fast food now because this place (as well as it's surrounding restaurants) are all too busy. I don't know what it is about the south side, people just love this area.   I love the food here and that's the reason it's popular. Their chicken marsala is hands down the best dish I've ever had at any restaurant, beating out traditional, family owned restaurants and the works. The cheesecake as well is their mean thing, it's excellent and although severely overpriced they at least give you a huge slice. They've got a huge menu to pick from and their alcohol is also excellent with probably the best margarita's I've ever had.  If you want to eat here, I recommend going on a secluded business day when everyone is working. in the past, I used to get seated in 10-20 minutes, but in the past couple months the wait times have been unacceptable. I also don't trust how well their cooks and staff can keep up with so many people if they cook the food well enough, I mean this place gets stupidly busy.",

However, tonight was a bit disappointing.  My husband spent more than i would have on his dinner, a steak and it showed up on a small plate, with basil or something, that looked old. The steak itself had lots of fat on it he had to trim off himself, and the steak overall did not taste great.  This was after waiting about 5 minutes for our server to notice we were not eating because my husbands side dish had not arrived.  When she finally brought it over it was plain french fries! Are you kidding me?!  For $25.00!!!  What a joke.  They looked like frozen, out of a bag fries.  Secondly our service was pretty bad, we asked for straws, they were pretty much thrown at us, and so was the bottle of ketchup.  Wasn't the nice dining experience we were hoping for.",

The South Side location like all other Cheesecake Factories that I have been to are grand in the decor. I do like the architecture on both the exterior and interior. After arriving inside, the main hostess greets me with a smile and points to where I would order out. The line was long and I was about 10-15 minutes away from getting to the front. The woman at the cashier was friendly and professional and offered the free bread with my order (yes please!). After 20 minutes, I got my eggplant sandwich with fries and bread and went home. Everything was delicious though by the time I got back to eat the sandwich it was soggy and the fries were nothing to rave about. I did as I always do enjoy the bread. Cheesecake Factory is a good restaurant that does the job (perfect to bring family since they offer many options to cater to everyone's taste buds and large portions) though I am unlikely to seek it out for a great meal.",

However, my last experience there was disturbing and I experienced the worst service I've ever had in my entire life. First of all we were told it was a 40 min wait. That was fine, we waited. After we got seated, we were there for 2 1/2 hours!!! And all we ordered was dinner. No appetizers, no dessert, no cocktails (well my friend had one cocktail, that's it.)  Our waiter, Joe was not attentive to us at all. Im guessing its because we ordered water for our drinks and we are in our early 20's so he probably assumed we weren't going to tip well. (were all in the service industry and usually tip between 20-30%, little did he know). He tended to every single table around us and would look at us and then walk away. He looked at us and walked away more than 8 times, to the point when we finally got our food wrapped and he asked if we wanted dessert we said no because we didn't want to wait another hour and decided it would be faster to go to the dessert bar and get it ourselves. The only person that was attentive but not in a good way, was the bus boy who tried to take our plates 5 mintues after we started eating. By the time we left I was so annoyed that I dont care how good the food is I wont go back. The most disturbing part, however, to this whole expierence was I actually witnessed a bus boy drop clean silverware on the floor, pick it up, and put it back to be rolled up as if it were still clean. THAT'S DISGUSTING!!!! Im appalled that this is supposed to be a high class restaurant but yet has the worst service and is dirty.",

    "text": "I sooo wanted to dislike this place.  It just seemed kind of silly when I heard of people waiting two hours to eat at what I thought was essentially a TGIF.  I first ate here about ten years ago in Vegas and I remember not being terribly impressed.  And, this was at the time when I thought the ground round was formal dining.  That being the case I was sure I would be disappointed this time.  I had lunch here on Monday afternoon with a friend.  It was around 230 PM and it was on a Monday so they weren't that busy.  The space itself is very nice.  It's attached to Ross Park Mall and is very big with a large open air environment.  The booths are spacious and the place feels clean and has a lot of dark wood.  As soon as we entered we were greated with a big smile and a friendly host.  We were seated at a good booth and the server arrived promptly.  They had a fun selection of iced teas and I think I had the passion fruit iced tea, which was \"unsweetened\" but I didn't believe it needed any additional sugar.  I ordered a black bean soup that was the special.  It was about average and the consistency for me was a little too mushed.  The sour cream on top was a good amount without being overwhelming.  They had a huge menu which is always kind of scary because who can do so many things so well.  I ordered a \"navajo\" chicken sandwich.  The reason I wanted to try it is because the bun was native american fry bread.  My friend ordered a burrito.  The navajo sandwich was delicious.  The fry bread was light and airy and perfect for the sandwich, which was chicken breast and avocado mostly.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry.  The avocado was perfect.  I often order avocado and it's not ripe enough.  The fries were forgettable.  Lisa's burrito was as big as my head.  It was okay.  Definitely a very americanized burrito relying more on heavy sauces and cheese than distinctive ingredients.  I'm not a dessert person, but she ordered the oreo cheesecake (I think?).  It was good, but not as good as I would expect from the \"CHEESECAKE\" factory.  The service continued to be perfect.  I was really impressed with the staff here.  This place is definitely better than TG McFunsteres... But, probably still not worth a two hour wait.",

The Brunch menu isn't extensive but the food is freshly prepared and there are no lines to wait in because of the time of day-so it's relatively quiet.  It's nice not to have to hear the clinging and clanging of kitchen activity while eating.

It is $1/hour on the street.  I'm not sure how much it is in the parking garage.  We went on a January Saturday afternoon at about 1:00 PM, we were seated right away. Our waitress was attentive.  The selection of food available is incredible and the portions are generous.  I had the dynamite shrimp, lunch herb crusted salmon and the mango key lime cheesecake.  Hubby had the wings and the mushroom burger with a side salad.  We loved our food.  The dynamite shrimp was deep fried and the sauce came on the side.  I'm not sure what the dinner portion would have been for the herb crusted salmon but the lunch portion was pretty big already.  It came with about five skinny asparagus and mashed potatoes.  The cheesecake....YUM!  It was really good.  Based on the quality of the food and the selection, I would recommend The Cheesecake Factory.",

On the other hand the place is not too shabby for a group night out but they don't take reservations.",

    "text": "No complaints about the food, it was tasty and plentiful.  However, we had two major complaints about the service:  1) We specifically asked the hostess for the quietest possible table. She said \"sure\", and then proceeded to seat us right next to the server's station, where they were constantly banging and crashing plates and silverware around. Numerous times I had to plug my ear with a finger to block out the noise.  This in itself pretty much ruined the meal.    2) The server was waaaay too \"attentive\". He was artificially perky and chatty and was constantly interrupting us with \"how are things\" and \"don't forget to leave room for dessert\", etc etc.   We had been trying to have a serious conversation over lunch but actually gave up on that due to the waiters constant (and unnecessary) interruptions.   Between the deafening noise and the pushy server, we had a rather negative experience.  Update Feb 21st:  I sent CF a link to this review. The manager of the location sent us a $15 gift card and an apology for our experience. We went back and had a nice dining experience. Food was great, waiter was not pushy at all. Thanks, Cheesecake Factory!",

    "text": "I came here several years ago and had my only poor experience at a Cheesecake Factory.  I thought maybe it was just that I didn't order the proper items.  Over the years, I have learned what I like here and so as to properly rate, I ordered those items:  Buffalo Blasts Classic Burger with Cheese (plain)  First and foremost, the service was poor.  There are a bunch of \"Wanna Be\" GUPPIES that work at this place and they have that certain mentality where everything smells of roses.  This transferred from Host to Servers to Runners.  I am trying to understand why the Runners were so arrogant.  Have you ever seen a trash man get a snooty/snotty arrogance when he talks about his job?  Oh to see the day.    The server finally took our order after several minutes of waiting.  The buffalo blasts arrived and they were good.  Just as I remember them from every other Cheesecake Factore.  They are basically an empanada (or meat pie) filled with shredded chicken, cheese and some buffalo sauce.  There is some additional buffalo sauce on the side and some peppered blue cheese dressing brought along for dipping.  Yes, this was good.  It was the highlight of this meal.  Our cheeseburger arrived.  I don't know what they did, but the flavor was off; it tasted as though they had saturated the bun in mayonaise or butter and then put it on the grill and then put additional fat on the hamburger patty.  I ate it, but I was less than thrilled with what was in front of me.  I could have given this restaurant a 3 for the Buffalo Blasts alone, but the GUPPIES just ruined it for me.  I doubt they have ever lived in a True urban setting...pompous mules.",

Their food is reliable, and seems to be pretty consistent across all the franchises so you always know what to expect. I guess I'm just not a fan of the hype. This one is no different, but the location is cool.   For those of you who don't know, South Side Works is an up-and-coming area just outside of downtown Pittsburgh across the river from Oakland. If you want a good slice of cheesecake, go to Cheesecake Factory. But there are a few other restaurants around the neighborhood, so check those out before dessert.",

However, as far as chains go, and I lump them in with places like Red Lobster, Olive Garden, etc. I have to say they do decent job.  I had the stuffed mushrooms to start, they were covered in a cheese sauce that didn't need to be there.  My dinner was a piece of overcooked salmon, that I am still not really convinced that it was actually salmon.  The portions are huge, which seems to delight the typical Pittsburgher for some reason, though not me.  The wait staff was attentive, though I the wait for bar drinks took some time.  I didn't try the cheesecake but from what I hear it is good.  We had a table of 13, and didn't take reservations  which is a little frustrating.",

    "text": "Of the three Cheesecake Factory's I've been to, including Vegas, this one is my favorite.  Nestled in the heart of South Side Works it's a great place to stop while shopping, seeing a movie at the cinema across the street, a free outdoor evening concert in 'Town Square' out front, or for a special Sunday brunch.  Valet parking makes dropping by for just the restaurant convenient, though for a longer shopping excursion you might opt for the SSW garage within strolling distance on a nice day.  The interior is a tad more grandiose than the other two locations I've been to and its this scale that, IMHO, makes the venue seem a little less chaotic even when the cue is flowing out the doors.  My menu favorites: Avocado Eggroll appetizer, Grilled Shrimp & Bacon Club w/fries (I always wind up taking half of this home), and their absolutely divine Lemoncello Cream Torte.  Sorry, with Lemoncello Cream Torte on the menu who needs sex, er um, cheesecake, but if you must - the Banana Cream or Key Lime cheesecakes are sure to curl your toes. ;)",

    "text": "I visited here with my family, and thankfully the wait was not too long.  (I've visited the one in Columbus and the wait on a weekend is still 3 hours, years after it opened.)  We didn't think much of the atmosphere - it was quiet and very dark, almost to the point where you couldn't see what you were eating.  I ordered a pasta but requested no nuts on top, due to my allergies, which I made clear to the waitress.  Because the restaurant was so dark, I didn't realize right away that there were nuts on it, but when the waitress came around again, I had to send my food back.  This always leads to awkwardness - do your dining companions keep eating, or do they let their food get cold while you're waiting for a new dish?  The manager apologized but we were still charged for the meal.  We thought the least he could do would be to comp it, as the whole incident considerably disrupted our dinner and it was the fault of either the waitress or kitchen staff.  But we decided to not make a fuss.  We ordered cheesecake to go, as we were full.  Once I got home, I dug into my Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough cheesecake.  At the time (this was several years ago), the menu did not mention that the cookie dough contained walnuts.  There was no little asterisk, no caution from the waitress, nothing.  I probably should have asked, but normally chocolate chip cookie dough does not contain walnuts, and with food allergies on the rise I feel that a restaurant should warn its patrons.  I made a complaint on the website and received a $25 gift card.  I haven't been back since, not because I'm boycotting but more because I don't find anything particularly fabulous about the menu and the wait times can be ridiculous.  But I did want to warn anyone with food allergies to be very careful about what they order, and to double-check with your waiter/waitress to avoid any bad reactions.",

Great happy hour deals - a number of apps are $6 (happy hour is only in the bar area). We tried the Buffalo chicken bombs on my most recent trip this week and they were SO YUM - fried and served with blue cheese.   My only complaint in this area is the parking is a headache. Cheesecake Factory doesn't have a lot. Plenty of garages around, but just not ideal.",

I lived in the DC metro area for years so I've gone to the one in DC/Bethesda, MD, Rockville, MD, Columbia, MD and Baltimore.  The one closest to me now is on the South Side of Pittsburgh.  I've been there several times.  Yesterday's visit  was awful.  I took my 2 children after church.  I ordered kids pizza for my son.  The pizza came out with almost all of the pepperoni burnt.  I didn't send it back because he was very hungry so he just picked off the burnt pieces.  My lunch pasta da'vinci and my daughters's jambalaya pasta were awful.  They were not seasoned at all.  Her pasta was spicy but that was it; otherwise it was tasteless.  My pasta was also tasteless so I kept adding salt to improve the taste which barely helped.    I also went to the same restaurant in September and ordered my favorite shrimp scampi.  It was very bland but I had waited so long and I was hungry so I didn't send it back.  I assumed this was a one time thing which is why I decided to go back yesterday.  I was wrong.  For the price I paid for our meals, drinks and desserts, $80, I expected quality.  What I got was sub-par at best.  I don't know if all of the restaurants are going downhill or just this one.  After these two experiences, I am hesitant to return to any Cheesecake Factory.",

This was my first time at this particular location but it seems to me that these places are always a zoo, regardless of when you visit (on top of that they don't seem to use Open Table or No Wait).  I thought I might have been a bit childish in ordering the Mac n Cheese Burger, that has a fried ball of mac n cheese atop the usual lettuce, tomato, onion inclusions, but it was fantastic! If you're attempting to be good or at least feel less guilty about dessert as I was, the house salad side in lieu of French fries is truly worth opting for aside the burger.  I'm not sure how long the 30th anniversary edition cheesecake will be in stock, but check out the description and seriously consider it if chocolate cake and chocolate fudge paired with cheesecake appeals to you. Service was great, 2 soft drinks, 2 meals, 1 slice of cheesecake and 22% tip came to $67- well worth it!",

We had never ate at a Cheesecake Factory before so we decided to give it a try. We came on a Steelers Sunday as well so it wasn't incredibly busy. The wait for a table was roughly five minutes. The waitress seemed to have too many tables and was trying her best to keep up. We got our drinks and bread and ordered which took roughly 20 minutes to do all three of those things. An hour and fifteen minutes later our food finally came... The waitress checked in on us twice in that span and didn't apologize for our food taking so long. When the meals finally came out, the food was very well presented and very tasty. We got refills for our drinks after we had finished our meals. I enjoyed the Louisiana Chicken Pasta and would recommend that dish if you like a spicier meal. The mediocre service would shy me away, but the food was good enough to possibly give it one more shot.",

    "text": "I'm actually really disappointed with my recent visit to the Cheesecake Factory. I think that three stars is rather generous for the sloppy salad and slow service during the lunch hour. I ordered a French Country Salad with crasins instead of beets, while my lunch buddy decided to get the Caesar salad. After we placed our order, the server brought out bread; however, there was only one type of bread in the basket to our disappointment, but oh well no biggie at this point. We didn't see it sever until our food was brought out, which seemed to take quite awhile, but again, no big deal at this point. However, as soon as I went to dig into my salad I noticed that the bits of asparagus, nuts, and goat cheese were all under my lettuce mix. This was strange. I asked the server where my crasins were she said oh sorry I had the cook make you a new salad since we put them directly on the salad (I asked for them on the side because I wasn't sure what I was going to get, crasins or actual cranberries). So, I doubt I got a new salad and just had the crasins taken out, which was why all of my toppings were under the salad. Again, this wasn't a big deal until I noticed that I had a lot of wilted and mushy lettuce in my salad. I was really really disappointed because that's just plain gross. I had the blackish pieces that get all slimy and stick to the other leaves.   Overall, the service wasn't anything to write home about and the salad quality wasn't very good.",

Unfortunately, my most recent visit was really unpleasant, and I feel that the mediocre experiences I've had in the past are probably as good as it can get.    Our most recent visit was on a busy night, and the wait was about a half an hour. We were pleasantly surprised that we were seated in only about 20 minutes, but it was only down hill from there.  We ordered the grilled artichoke as an appetizer (which probably wasn't the strongest choice considering the other options), but it was inedible. I'm not a picky eater and I've never sent any dish back at a restaurant, so we didn't make a fuss, but we physically could not chew it.  When our waiter saw that we had hardly touched it and asked how it was, we just laughed and said it was inedible, but all he said was, \"hopefully your entrees are better.\"   My boyfriend ordered the spicy cashew chicken and I ordered the chicken piccata.  My chicken was okay.  It didn't have a whole lot of flavor, and it only had 3 little capers on it (which is my favorite part!), but the spicy cashew chicken was really bad.  The rice was actually floating in the amount of sauce that the chicken was drenched in.  My boyfriend could hardly eat any of it.  To make things worse, we never once had our waters filled during the entire meal even though my boyfriend's water was empty after only about 20 minutes.  In addition, our waiter was very difficult to track down to get our checks, and then it was a good while once again before he took our payment.    The only redeeming aspect of our meal was the dessert.  We ordered the red velvet cheesecake (in which we waited quite some time to order it and then have it brought to our table), but it was delicious! I will probably opt out of ever dining here again, but I might order the cheesecake for takeout.",

Been to the cheesecake factory before. I feel like the menu is way too big. I feel the food could be phenomenal but there is just way too much on the menu. We were seated immediately and were waited on promptly by our wonderful waitress. She was great the entire time we were there. I chose the herb encrusted salmon with the lemon sauce on the side. The fish was way overcooked but the asparagus and mashed potatoes were yummy. My niece chose fettuccine Alfredo and thought is was delightful. My sister chose the ahi tuna salad and raved about it. The hubby got the Cuban sandwich and liked it a lot noting a little greasy but good. My mom got the chicken salad sandwich and liked it other than the fact it was too much to eat. My dad got some sort of chicken and liked it (I am not sure what kind of chicken because he was at the opposite end of the table). Then dessert. You can't go to the cheesecake factory and not get dessert. Me and my mom got the strawberry classic. Light and tasty! The hubby chose tiramisu which he thoroughly enjoyed (it too was good, good flavor and a huge portion). My dad got chocolate cake which he devoured. My sister got the salted caramel pretzel, wow! It was heavier but man was it scrumptious! And the birthday girl chose the tuxedo which was chocolatey and good! All in all the food was just okay. The wait staff was terrific and the dessert is phenomenal!",

    "text": "AVOID!! AVOID!! AVOID!!  I have always enjoyed The Cheesecake Factory chain and have dined at several of their establishments along the East Coast.  Sadly, my experience at this particular establishment was by far the worst in my life.  My family had planned for weeks on eating at the Cheesecake Factory in South Side for my brothers college graduation dinner.  We called ahead and were told you could not make reservations.    Upon our arrival there were only a few groups waiting.  We were told it would be a 40 minute wait.  This was expected since we had a party of 8.  However, while waiting we noticed some groups seemed to have special treatment and had been allowed to make reservations.  We checked on the wait several times and were continuously told we were next.  They even went as far as to tell they were pushing tables together.  We watched as party after party who had arrived after us were seated.  Even large parties of 20, 12, and 9.    After an hour it was clear something was wrong.  My brother, who was supposed to be celebrating his graduation, questioned the hostess on the protocol of seating customers.  She assured we were next and that it was first come first serve.  He pointed out that everyone who had arrived after us has been given tables.  She said he was wrong and that we would be next.  2 minutes later she seated a party of 9 before us.  After waiting an hour and never being given a table.  Our entire party walked out unfed and angry.  It's a shame that loyal paying customers would be treated that way.  Grab a slice of cheesecake to go and head elsewhere for dinner.",

My dishes were always decent but I always ended up spending any from 20-30 dollars.   I ran into some slight problems though when attempting to buy cheesecake for my roommate. I don't eat cheesecake and when I ask the man... hmm I mean apathetic adolescent behind the counter which cheesecake he'd recommend he seemed a little annoyed by my question and without looking at me said he didn't like cheesecake. Fine whatever. Maybe they stashed him behind that particular counter so he wouldn't be tempted to nibble away at the confections. So I deferred to the girl next to him. Apparently she didnt like cheesecake either and had no opinions on the matter. The worker behind her same situation. Thanks for all the help. In the end i made the decision with the help of another patron.",

I like how there are many shops around it just incase you need to kill time and it is very convenient for the movie theater to be right across the street.   They have a big selection of food, desserts and drinks. And the portions are big so you get your money's worth. The only downside is that this location gets really crowded because a lot of people from the Southside, downtown and neighboring areas flock to this location. Usually, if you go to get a table anytime before 6:30 it won't be a bad/long wait.",

    "text": "If you like things overdone, then the Cheesecake Factory is for you.  The menu is HUGE.  The positive is that it offers tons of choices so even the pickiest eater can find something.  The downside is that it can be very difficult to choose unless you are in the mood for something in particular.   This location has a large seating area and also offers outdoor patio seating.  We went on a Thursday evening and were able to be seated right away.    Service was friendly and efficient.  She was attentive but not intrusive.     We tried the Buffalo Bites and the fried macaroni and cheese.  The Buffalo Bites were more than enough for a meal by themselves.  There were a lot of them there.  The flavor is spicy but not over the top.  One of my favorite items on the menu.  We also tried the macaroni and cheese balls.  They were tasty and although it doesn't seem like a lot (especially compared to the number of buffalo blasts) they are filling and worth ordering.  Entrees were pasta and the chicken bam bam.  Both portions were HUGE and enough to serve at least two or three people.  The positive on that was leftovers for two additional meals.  Both were flavorful and we would order both of them again.    Not that either of us had the room for it, but we both ordered cheesecake.  I went for the red velvet cheesecake and my husband ordered the cherry cheesecake.  Topped with a generous dash of whipped cream, the size of the pieces was substantial (as they should be for $7 a slice).  They were tasty and stood up well to being eaten several days later as part of our leftovers.  I was disappointed they discontinued the salted carmel pretzel drink, but other than that, this was a top notch visit to the Cheesecake Factory.",

    "text": "I feel a little silly rating this chain but here's my justification:  For some reason, I don't know why, but the Cheesecake Factory in King of Prussia was amazing, and I expected the same when I went to the one in South Side. I was horribly disappointed. Not only was the atmosphere a little different, the food wasn't as good as I had remembered.  I'm willing to pay a pretty penny for a nice meal but this was way overpriced for what they were serving you. The portion sizes at South Side weren't as generous either.   This place is a quintessential American restaurant so don't expect anything \"exotic\" or unique. You can pretty much get their food at a diner for half the cost.  There is one redeeming quality for the Cheesecake Factory - the cheesecake. Everything else on the menu you can skip, but if you want to lull yourself in a sugar coma the cheesecake here is your calling. While it is still overpriced for their cheesecake, splurging every once in a while didn't kill me.",

Bill + tip totaled around $130 for a group of four. We had a total of 5 or 6 drinks, shared a couple of appetizers, had our own meals, and shared cheesecake.

I guess eating alone is forbidden or at least frowned upon at this restaurant. The only good thing was the wait was reasonable. In about 15 minutes, I was seated.   I was seated at a sticky table. I asked the waiter if he could wipe it off. He was ok with that request. I doubt I can explain how much the rag he used to wipe off the table stunk. So why didn't I leave? I kept thinking, I used to love this place. I placed my drink order and my meal order - Thai Lettuce Wraps. They were out of the lettuce wraps. Ok, now what?  I ordered a side salad and hamburger sliders.   10 minutes, 15 minutes and I'm still waiting on my drink from the bar. Why am I still there?  My meal came and FINALLY my drink came. The salad, $5.99, was wilted lettuce, three paper thin slices of cucumber and two tomato wedges!!  The sliders came. There were four sliders. I ate two. The waiter returned with my bill. Wait, Cheesecake Factory- shouldn't he at least mention the cheesecake?  Nothing.   I paid, I finally did what I should have done an hour and a half ago - I left. I will never be back!

    "text": "We always go to Cheesecake Factory when in Pittsburgh. The hostess was very nice and sat us immediately. The server greeted us and we connected right away. He was very helpful and patient. The food was great except mine, Chicken Romano. It was uneventful. Additionally, the appetizer took forever (50 minutes) but it was worth it, absolutely delicious (Thai Lettuce Wrap). Luckily, the manager gave it to us for free and apologized profusely. We also had delicious fresh baked bread to entertain us while we waited. The atmosphere was lovely. We had a great time!",

The clean decor, almost unbelievably extensive menu, and well trained servers make it a potential destination for virtually every American. The service is good and the food is decent, with huge American portions. There is nothing to complain about but also nothing distinctive. Prices are on the high side given the quality, but not high enough to drive the customers away. It's much more acceptable for lunch than dinner.",

    "text": "Came on a Saturday night. The wait was absolutely insane. It was chaos when you walked in, couldn't figure out where the line was and no one else could either, we had to keep telling people. The wait was an hour to an hour and a half. We went to the bar while we waited and seats happened to open up at the bar thankfully! We all got drinks and hung out while we waited. The service at the bar was good at first but then they ignored us and the bar tenders were upset with each other and communication. They would yell at each other because one would give a receipt for another party and they didn't know who to give it to.   Luckily, we got a booth seat. The lighting was a little too dark, I couldn't see the difference between the onions, garlic, and mushrooms on my plate, which wasn't good for me because I don't like onions or big garlic chunks. Service was quick once we were seated and food came quickly. We ordered drinks and I got the Georgia peach. Delicious!! I could drink them all night. I ordered the combo of shrimp scampi and steak Diane. Both were delicious. I did ask for my steak medium and it was the most well done steak I've ever received. Still good taste, but for the price, I want my steak cooked correctly. This place is nice to come to for occasions. We all got our cheesecake to go. We got cookie dough cheesecake & the s'mores! Very good!",

    "text": "A must go to for anyone who loves cheesecake. Their menu is extensive, so everyone should be able to find something on the menu. My favorite appetizer to share is the eggroll sampler. The avocado egg roll is amazing and creamy. The salmon firecracker roll containers perfectly cooked salmon in a crispy wrapper. It also comes with the cuban egg roll, tex mex egg roll, and plenty of dipping sauces.   The Louisiana Chicken pasta was very heavy and ginormous, so I had leftovers. The pasta dish was fine, nothing special. Sometimes I just don't even get an entree to save room for cheesecake.   My favorite cheesecake is probably the Mango Key Lime Cheesecake. The crust is made with coconut macaroons, then there is the mango cheesecake, and on top is a smooth mango mousse. The cheesecake is a light and refreshing way to end the meal. It is not too sweet or artificial tasting. I have also had the cookie dough cheesecake, which is good but not out of this world.",

    "text": "Let me just say I get so annoyed when my SO suggests to go here because I spend a half hour just trying to read the menu- it is 21 pages. Literally the most frustrating thing about the Factory- even after you decide you immediately wonder if you should have scanned the menu one more time!   We started off with the crab/artichoke dip with soft baguette slices. It was good, but nowhere near the best crab dip we have had. To their credit it did have a very generous amount of crab!  I always have to have a side salad with my dinner; it's just mandatory for me! I decided on the tossed salad, though I really wanted the Greek salad. For only 6.95, this salad was huge! A bit more than your typical side salad but that's because it's way bigger. Although I would give it 5/5, it was unfortunate that I just couldn't eat it all because I still needed to eat my meal!  I got the Pasta Da Vinci for my entree; I love mushrooms and was excited to see a variety of different types of mushrooms in a pasta dish. The mushrooms were incredible, and the grilled chicken was cooked very well, but the sauce was very bland. It was okay, but nothing spectacular.  My SO enjoyed his dinner; he said the shrimp scampi was one of the best things he's ever eaten! The mashed potatoes were okay, but not very creamy, more lumpy and a bit dry. Some pieces of his steak were cooked perfectly, while others were a bit tough.  All-in-all, with Cheesecake Factory, I just wasn't blown away with the food, especially for the (dinner) price.",

    "text": "My first time in a Cheesecake Factory was last week, when we had our office holiday lunch there.  I was struck by how...well....HUGE the place was.  I felt like I was in Honey I Shrunk the Kids, if that movie took place in some kind of pseudo-Tuscan sculpture garden.  Seriously, the building is enormous, the ceilings are waaaaay up there, and the food....I felt dwarfed by that as well.  Our servers were super friendly, especially considering how challenging it can be to serve a party of twelve.  Everything came out quickly - surprisingly quickly - almost as if they predicted what we were going to order and had it waiting for us.  I'm assuming that isn't the case, and that all the food is just organized in such a way that any dish can be assembled in about 5 minutes.  I had some bites of various appetizers, including the Fried Calimari, the Hot Spinach and Cheese Dip, and the Warm Crab and Artichoke Dip (which is technically a \"small plate,\" not an appetizer).  I just realized how humorous it is that one of the dips is described as Hot, and the other as Warm.  They both tasted hot to me!  All the apps were okay - the dips were gooey (in a good way), the calimari was crispy.  Everything was a bit on the salty side, not surprisingly for a chain restaurant, but not unpleasantly so.  The Spinach dip was a little runny for my taste, but it tasted good!  For my entree, I got the Cuban sandwich.  It had all the classic ingredients: pork, ham, Swiss cheese, mustard, pickles.  It also had mayo on it, which I didn't really care for - I know they do that in some restaurants, but I don't really think of it as traditional. And they were pretty heavy-handed with it.  Other than that the sandwich was all right - again, pretty darn salty.  My boyfriend ate the other half later and he really enjoyed it.  I think in retrospect, I should've gone with a different choice.  For dessert, I had the Snickers cheesecake.  A good size slice, served unnecessarily with two huge scoops of whipped cream (seriously, what?  who needs all that?)  I really liked the cheesecake, but ended up taking half of it home, along with some of my coworker's pumpkin cheesecake which was also delicious.  the prices are affordable, the service is uber friendly, the cheesecake is tasty, and the food is pretty reliable.  I'm not big into chains so I don't think I'd be keen to return, especially since they do have a heavy hand with salt, and because the food here is, well, massively unhealthy.  I found the nutrition facts on another website and, well, it scared me.  I can see why some people would really like this place, since they have a huge variety of things and big portions. Nothing really wowed me, but it was a fine place to have a company lunch!",

    "text": "EDIT: I am lowering the score from 2* to 1* because while it's forgivable that the FOH staff spilled something on me and my party's clothing, it isn't okay that they simply don't bother to fix that problem going forward. The manager gave us two business cards after being splashed with buffalo sauce and said that if we mailed the receipts for dry cleaning with those cards it would be reimbursed. We sent in two receipts (my fiance and I) with bills totaling $22 but after 2 months have received nothing back. I have worked as a waiter for years and I get these things happen but it is incumbent on the management staff to resolve these issues and I think the poor job they did trying to fix the situation is indefensible.   Meh!  This place is just silly and expensive for the quality.   Quick thing about the restaurant: Why make waiters wear all white? EVERY server's uniform has visible stains. I have waited tables for years so I get how this happens all the time when you are bussing plates so have the waiters wear darker colors (or enforce uniform standards, there is no way all the waiters came in with clean clothes given the universal level of dirtiness). Also, a waiter dropped a thing of buffalo sauce on the floor near us which exploded on both me and one of the people I was with's white shirts, the restaurant offered to pay for dry cleaning, but I kinda think that there should be a comped desert or something as well. The dry cleaning (if effective) is an inconvenience for me which gets me back to where I was before I came in, I think that offering a dessert is something to make up for the inconvenience of making me and my dinner guest have to go to get our clothes dry cleaned. Perhaps I expect too much.  About the actual food: it's just not anything worth paying the price for. I had Bang Bang chicken and shrimp, it was labelled as spicy and I asked for it to be extra spicy, there was no spice at all.   My fiance had orange chicken. It was plain and less than one would expect from a basic chinese take-away.  The other person we were with ordered meatloaf, it was actually ok but the mashed potatoes were cool by the time it was run to our table.  I honestly think that the restaurant just has too many things on that menu to get all of the items right.  Positives: the iced tea was good (this matters a lot to me) as were the mojitos the ladies ordered. Two of our deserts were great (I guess this is really why people go here), the tiramisu cheesecake was still thawing when it was brought to us so it was a bit hard in the middle.",

Do chicken breast sandwiches need to look like the meat came from a chicken grown in Chernoble? Let's explore further, cheesecake without sugar? Makes sense for those who are diabetic. But let's really see who orders sugar free cheesecake. More than likely it's the people who devour the previously mentioned mac & cheese, then to ease that guilt, order the sugar free cheesecake, that has over 50 grams of fat because it's made with cream cheese and eggs., and served with a huge dollop of real whipped cream, which by the way contains SUGAR.               Ok, let me be fare, once in awhile this place can be good, like once every few months. I've eaten there and I used to be a big eater, and as a lover of food I was impressed by the portions. They are so big i could take most of the meal home and eat it for lunch and dinner the next day.  It's a bit expensive, but for what you get it's worth the extra spending.",

I love the cheesecake factory it was one of the very first \"nice\" restaurants i had been too. Well what I thought was nice at the time. The decor inside is great, nice clean tables with linens, yes that right linens! the MENU is EXTENSIVE. They have everything from Asian to American and all in between. The food is really good but not up-scale quality. Always nice plating presentation. I got the chicken pesto pasta dish (wish I could remember its name) none the less delicious. The cheesecake menu is elaborate and they always update the menu with specials added. The bill leaving with cheesecake dinner and app with complimentary bread was around 40.00, YES i said 40.00 for 2. Such a great date night dinner paired with a movie its sure to impress any ordinary lady. A little more about the interior is huge high ceilings with pillars and faux painting to make the insides look like old Tuscan themed buildings. the lighting is a blend between modern and fresco period and lights a set to dim. Each table has its own real lit candles. This is a great place for groups and family dinners birthdays etc. I usually don't fall into the trap of what I like to call COOKIE CUTTER restaurants but if I had to choose between the factory and any other place Ive ever went its in top 3! Plus there is so much on the menu to choose from your bound to satisfy any palette.",

I don't want all that food, nor do I want to PAY for all that food that I do not want...  Got some gift cards for Christmas, so off we went.  They've got a new (new to me, anyway) menu section of starters/small plates, separate from the appetizer menu, which I think is just PERFECT and completely removes my primary gripe with the restaurant!   I had their Vietnamese Tacos--bbq pork and crunchy, fresh and spicy cucumber/carrot slaw on steamed buns (3). DELICIOUS! The steamed buns were slightly sweet, so soft...it was a perfect combination for me. I think it was $6.95.  I had a similar sandwich at Emeril Lagasse's NOLA, and I have to say that this one was much tastier. I underestimated the portion on the small plate and also ordered a pear, arugula & Gorgonzola flatbread (maybe they call it a pizzette?). Was lovely, but I took most of it home and enjoyed it for lunch today.   Skipped the cheesecake and desserts. Just tryin to be good.   Service was great.  All in all, they've gotten themselves a new return customer by offering the choice of not getting 3 days' worth of meals on one plate. Yay!",

    "text": "(start rant) I don't like reviewing chain restaurants b/c well.... they're chains.  And the pro's / con's of a chain typically persist from restaurant to restaurant.  This review is no different.  Cheesecake Factory has decent food w/ large portions.  There's something for everyone on the menu.  Except those watching their figure.  If you've never seen their nutritional information before and aren't in the mood to cry, stop reading.  For everyone else, read on.  ********** Let's start with a chicken quesadilla for an appetizer to split!  Oh wait, that's 1270 calories?  With 38 grams of saturated fat?  and 2270 mg of sodium?  Hmm, let's skip that and grab our entrees.  I hear their Chicken Madeira is pretty tasty!  Oh hi there 1420 calories, 44 grams of saturated fat and over 2000 mg of sodium!  How about some pasta?  I hear their Bistro Shrimp pasta is legit!  Oh wait, it's 2290 calories and has 73 grams of saturated fat...  I guess I'll get some healthy seafood instead...  That miso salmon sounds good!  And so does the 1670 calories that come with it, along with its 39 grams of saturated fat and over a day's worth of sodium!  (note: none of these figures include any sides: add a mashed potatoes and you get an additional 560 calories)  I think I'll stick with a salad...  how about the grilled chicken tostada salad?  The chicken is grilled so it HAS to be healthy right?  If 1130 calories with 2150 mg of sodium is healthy, then I guess so...  (here's a note of comparison: two Big Macs actually has less calories and sodium than this salad.)  Add any slice of cheesecake and you have over a day's worth of calories and fat and sodium (all cheesecakes have at least 300 mg of sodium and some specialty desserts have over 1000 mg) **********  I don't mind calorie laden food, but I'd rather save my calories for tastier food elsewhere.  Yes restaurant food is typically bad for you, but if I'm dropping $20-$30 for dinner at a place and it's going to be bad for me, the food better be delicious, and taking reservations might be nice too.  Since Cheesecake Factory doesn't take reservations and the food isn't all that great, I feel no remorse whenever I pass by Cheesecake Factory in lieu of other restaurants. (end rant)  Okay Cheesecake Factory isn't the spawn of the devil as I had put it out to be, and it's not too bad for larger parties with picky eaters.  And it's not like I'm going to cry if I were to go back again and again, it just wouldn't be my first choice for dinner.... or second, or third, or fourth or fifth...  Sorry ladies; you better pick somewhere else to go for that girl's night out if you want that killer beach bod in time for summer.",

Sure, it's hard to believe that a restaurant with the word cheesecake in its name could in any way disappoint. But believe it.   This restaurant boasts of having 200 dishes on its menu. Points for variety? Nope, what this says to me is that instead of making a handful of dishes really well, they endeavor to make 200 mediocre ones. I've eaten here twice and sampled the entrees of my table-mates, so I'd say I've tried about 8 dishes. All were mediocre - neither great nor shitty. Think: the approximate quality of any decent hospital cafeteria food. At 3 times the cost. The desserts rank a bit better on the taste scale but not by much. The decor is gawd-awful.",

For National Cheesecake Day, the Cheesecake Factory was offering half-off a slice of cheesecake which was the only reason I went. There was a line to get to the hostess but she did a great job keeping everything in order. I only had to wait thirty minutes to get seated. Our waiter was very personable and knew about the new cheesecake flavor that came out that day. I was pleasantly surprised that we got complimentary bread. Of the two options, I liked the wheat better than the white. For my cheesecake, I chose the fresh strawberry cheesecake. It was not bad nor awesome. The cream part of the cheesecake was smooth but did not have the flavor of cream cheese. The graham cracker crust did not hold up well. I did not know that the fresh strawberry cheesecake cost slightly more than the other more elaborate cheesecake so I was slightly shocked when my bill came. The mediocre cheesecake did not make me want to come back here anytime soon.",

    "text": "Fine is one of my favorite words of ambivalence.  I use it frequently, probably more than I should.  \"How was your day?\" \"It was fine.\" Not good...not terrible, just...fine.  That is how I feel about The Cheesecake Factory.  In my opinion, there is nothing great about it, but it's certainly not the worst restaurant.  It's fine.  I went to The Cheesecake Factory at Southside Works last Thursday with a few girlfriends.  We decided to order a few drinks and share appetizers, nothing out of the ordinary.  The restaurant wasn't crowded, so we got a table right away.  (Which was good because some of us suffer from a very serious affliction called Hungergrump).  Once hungergrump sets in, the affected person cannot be held responsible for the change in mood.  It's abrupt and horrifying...the only cure is food....now.)  Anyway, we were seated, and  ordered drinks.   I am a big fan of bleu cheese stuffed olives, so I ordered the Well-Mannered Martini, a Ketel One vodka martini, straight-up & dirty with the bleu cheese olives.  My roommate had the same, my sister had a bloody mary, and another friend ordered a Lemon Drop martini.  We were all pretty happy with our drinks, and I'll tell you right now that the drinks were the best part of the meal.  Then, we ordered four appetizers to share.  The thing is we forgot that we were at The Cheesecake Factory and that the portions there are out of control.   I've been to CF many times, and every time I've had to take a doggy bag.  The portion sizes are BIG.  The prices correspond to the size of the dishes, but both are, I think, larger than necessary.  So very American.  We ordered white-bean hummus, Tex-Mex eggrolls, grilled chicken nachos, and buffalo blasts.  We loved the blasts and the hummus.  The hummus tasted fresh, although there was nothing particularly dazzling about the dish; grocery store hummus is just as good.  (Sidenote:  Sabre Supremely Spicy Hummus is awesome!)  Buffalo Blasts are fried pockets of buffalo chicken dip.  They are good, I get them frequently, but they are nothing special.  The eggrolls were fine; they came with an awesome teriyaki sauce.  Though the nachos were delicious, it was just too much food...we barely touched them.  I think when ordering for a group, it's better to have too much food rather than not enough, obviously.  We forgot, though, where we were.  And nachos do not reheat well.  After the meal of appetizers and vodka, my friends and I shared slice of Dulce de Leche Cheesecake.  It was really very delicious, especially after the spicy meal.  Cheesecake and coffee and some good buddies...man...when did my life become Golden Girls?  It was a nice evening.  The drinks were good, the food was fine, and the service was pretty good, too,  but, as I said, nothing out of the ordinary. The Cheesecake Factory 415 South 27th Street.

Everything was absolutely delicious from the Georgia Peach I ordered from the bar menu to the S'mores Cheesecake I had for dessert.

I live in Uniontown, so I love to travel to Pittsburgh every now and then for a wider variety of restaurants, shopping malls, and more. This place is to die for! I had a spicy chicken sandwich with fries, which was HUGE! Great size for the price! And of course, the main reason I go is the cheesecake. Oh my God. The Reese's Cheesecake is heaven. The building is gigantic, and beautiful. It has a nice patio, and a garden area to sit down in. Plus, all of the shops downtown make it a great, and busy spot! Which is the only downfall, it is way too busy! I waited an hour and a half just for my friend and I to eat here, but in the end, it was well worth it!",

    "text": "First, the downsides, and there are not many: the crowds and the wait: no reservations, no phone-ahead seating, no No-Wait app.  Be prepared to wait for a long time on a weekend night.  I understand the wait can be two hours, a lengthy of time I would never wait for a table anywhere.  My wife and I planned an early dinner, able to be seated within ten minutes of our Friday 6:00 p. m. arrival. By the time we left at a quarter to eight, the place was mobbed despite the bitter cold weather.   Some of the tables for two are very close to each other.  Hold out for a table or booth in the main room which looks out onto the street and which offers a view.  The restaurant is attractive, distinctive, and comfortable.  The seating in the main room is marvelous, nicely spaced.  The bill can escalate quickly, but if one is going to spend $100 on a grand night out, this is the place to do it.   The banquet my wife and I enjoyed included: a draft Samuel Adams seasonal brew, a glass of house wine, a large kale and quinoa salad, a delicious, good-sized appetizer consisting of zucchini fries, portobello mushrooms, and avocado, a large fish sandwich with cole slaw and onion rings, and a great burger with mushrooms, cheeses, and onions on a fresh sesame seed bun, one slice of cheesecake with strawberries, one slice of tiramisu cheesecake, and two types of bread (our favorite is the dark, seeded variety).  I know of no restaurant with as many choices of perfectly prepared foods than The Cheesecake Factory.  If you have difficulty deciding what to order, you will be confounded by page after page of the extensive menu.  Teamwork service ensures that the diner is well taken care of and our primary server, Grace, was sweet, friendly, attentive, and delightful.  Our trip to the restaurant was longer than a half hour and it was worth going out of the way to enjoy.  Bravo!",

The spicy chipotle chicken pasta is honey Glazed Chicken, Asparagus, Red and Yellow Peppers, Peas, Garlic and Onion in a Spicy Chipotle Parmesan Cream Sauce(this is what my mother always orders when dining here). The Louisiana chicken pasta is Parmesan Crusted Chicken Served Over Pasta with Mushrooms, Peppers and Onions in a Spicy New Orleans Sauce. The chicken madeira is Sauteed Chicken Breast Topped with Fresh Asparagus and Melted Mozzarella Cheese. Covered with Fresh Mushroom Madeira Sauce and Served with Mashed Potatoes. The godiva cheesecake is Layers of Flourless Godiva Chocolate Cake, Godiva Chocolate Cheesecake and Chocolate Mousse. It also comes with a godiva square. It always crowded and honestly there are better restaurants to eat at in the south side then this chain but it sure was nice being able to eat this food for free regularly!",

Still that slice is so decadent and rich!! It's worth every penny!!  Then onto the food, I think the menu is a BOOK!  Their main characters in this novel of a menu is GREAT FOOD.  I got me the twisted salted pretzel spiked milkshake, drizzled with caramel.  These meals are not everyday meals, but special occasions.  This place is well worth the money!!  Then I got chicken taco's, and the hubby got some yummy mexican dish with those delectable black beans.    Other times I've tried the portabella sandwich, that proved to be so tasty that I think I got it twice from there.  Cheesecake factory isn't just a restaurant, it's a experience.  There ambiance is superb, relaxing and just beautiful architecture.  This place has a upscale feel, in a laid back vibe.  I just LOVE IT~!!  Since this place is popular, and we have only a few scattered over Pittsburgh, there may be a wait time.  Especially on weekends.  Trust me, it's worth it!",

The menu is almost overwhelming, and they keep adding more and more items to it.  Actually they did recently just come out with a skinnylicious menu, so that might answer some negative complaints about their portions and nutrition.

My boyfriend and I always go with the intention of splitting appetizers, because that's enough food in itself to satiate us.  We ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps (which comes on a PLATTER - meaning its ENORMOUS), the Chicken Pot Sticker Dumplings, and Stuffed Mushrooms (from the \"small snacks\" menu, but even it being a \"small snack\" there were still 9 stuffed mushrooms).    Now I normally don't like to give a bad review of the place, based solely on the performance of the server.  I was once a server myself, for a good 12 years, and I know they are human, they have a butt load of sidework, and sometimes find themselves in the \"weeds\" when the crowd all rushes in at once.  I understand all of this and try not to let it effect the rest of my dining experience when we dine on a night like this.  However, when a server - or MULTIPLE servers on different occasions, are consistently rude and inattentive because we choose to ONLY order appetizers, is unacceptable.  And we have only experienced this attitude at the South Side location.   The moment we said we were \"just ordering a few appetizers\", her body language and facial expression could have spelled out a symphony of harmonious disappointment and irritation.  Little did she know how low-maintenance/high-tippers we normally are.  I ordered decaf coffee and a water, my boyfriend ordered a hot tea and a water - but never once, not even after she brought our appetizers, did we ever see a glass of water.  I guess decaf coffee is supposed to be a delicate complement to Chicken Pot Stickers.     Plus - THE RACKET!!!!  All of the servers and the bussers are extremely clumsy with taking away dishes, and re-setting tables.  I think we heard about 5 dishes crack the 45 minutes we were there. The entire night, my boyfriend and I had to keep asking each other to repeat ourselves, because of all the dishes and utensils clanking every single second we sat there.  Basically, in restaurant talk - the FOH might as well have not existed because it was as loud as the BOH or HOH (the kitchen for normal speaking folk).    I know this is a corporate juggernaut, and I do know what I should expect upon going in one.  This place is definitely sub-par of it's corporate standards.  I'll stick with McKnight Rd if we ever venture for quick apps again.",

The Cheesecake Factory has such a huge list on the menu, I feel like I could go here for a month and still not get the same food. The atmosphere is great for families, friends, dates  and just anyone! And also as a bread addict, I cannot skip mentioning about their wheat and sourdough bread. This place truly has the best bread.  Getting their organic coffee after a HUGE meal w their decadent Kahlua cheesecake is another great part too. I don't think any entree has disappointed me here. It's definitely my favorite franchise family restaurant. MUST GO!",

I was feeling a salad so i got the Carlton salad and it was pretty damn good. The tangerines on it were super juicy and tasty and there was no issue with the greens. The only problem was there was barely any chicken on it! For a 12.00 salad i expected a little bit more. But all in all was satisfied.  The cheesecake, ohhh the cheesecake. I got the red velvet cake cheesecake and it was to die for. Thw cake part was super moist and the rest was rich and creamy. I refused to waste one bite!  Our server was great, had a good sense of humor and was very attentitive.   We went at like 12:30 so there was no wait and everything came out fast.",

Good fresh HUGE salads and great cheesecake. Well, the salads are still huge, but that's about all I can say for the them. And the cheesecake? I wouldn't know. Suddenly, the flourless Godiva chocolate cheesecake is no longer gluten-free. What happened???!!!   I ordered the Santa Fe salad, which I've had before and enjoyed, and got something not even resembling what used to be. The chicken is either chicken lunchmeat or they now shaaaave it so thin it can't be found OR tasted. The cheese was skimpy, the corn was almost nonexistent....there was LOTS of lettuce...oh, and one tomato quarter. Why bother?   One of my dining companions ordered the Cobb salad. She had the same experience with skimpiness of ingredients. Where was the bleu cheese? She could barely identify any bacon pieces. There were TONS of hardboiled egg crumbles surrounding the plate, but nothing much else that should have been there....again, LOTS of lettuce. Oh, and the dressing was not discernible at all. After asking about the bleu cheese and dressing, the water brought over a small bowl of extra (?) bleu cheese and a small pitcher of dressing.   The restaurant was not crowded at all, the service was slow and spotty. All in all, the three of us wouldn't bother going back again. No loss.  Not only that, we each had to pay $5 to park????  And there's nothing at Southside Works anymore anyway.",

Our waiter (wish I had his name to give him a shout out) was probably the best I've had there, super on top of things and very friendly. Little things like asking if we had a preference for the type of bread that was brought to the table and also bringing me a to go cup of my drink without me even asking (the person I was with got a to go coffee, he didn't want me to feel left out!) were great.

My friends and I put our names on the waiting list around 7 and did not get seated until close to 9pm. We actually ended up getting a couple drinks at a bar close to the Cheesecake Factory and another at the Cheesecake Factory while we waited. I am definitely not complaining about this since it is typically this busy on Saturday nights in South Side.  The service, especially for how busy it was, was FANTASTIC! I wish I remembered our waitress' name, but she got us drinks (waters because, you know) and checked back multiple times for when we were ready to order. Typically you'd expect the service to be slow and hard to get when it's this busy, but we ordered and our food was out in probably 30 mins tops! I got the Chicken and Avacado Club Sandwich and it was deeeelicious! Everything was hot and crunchy - it was worth the wait! However, one of my friends ordered a cheesecake from the front counter before we left and that took almost 20 minutes or so to get, which I didn't really understand.  If you aren't in a rush, I'd say just stick out the wait because it is so worth it! They let you take the buzzers out of the restaurant, as long as you're in the restaurant 15-20 minutes before your buzzer should go off. It ended up being a nice dinner and I was definitely impressed with the service and food for how busy it was.",

    "text": "This place is the epitome of average.   First and foremost I will say what needs to be said, the fact that this place is not decorated like a factory on the inside is a HUGE marketing misstep. There is nothing remotely factory like in this place. This place should look industrial on the inside with exposed beams and things of that nature. Instead they went for some Italian-Grecian blend look that truly does not match anything. This matched with the menu that covers everything from Asian food to American classics, none of it makes sense.  Now let's discuss the menu. If you need page numbers on the menu, you're serving too much. The classic adage is that if you do not specialize in anything, it is because you aren't good at anything. And boy does that ring True here. Everything I have ever eaten here is average at best. It is always lacking in flavor and any sort of pizzazz. This past visit I got a cheese stuffed cheeseburger. Now I will profess as a longtime victim of lactose intolerance, I shouldn't have indulged, but I couldn't resist. The idea of this burger was salivating. And boy do I regret it. Not for the gut wrenching pain that I experienced, but for the fact that the burger tasted like absolutely nothing, with no spices and flavor. The pain was not even worth it. I have had a school cafeteria burger with more flavor.  Overall, this place is truly a glorified Applebees. They charge far too high prices so that you think you're eating at a fancy restaurant, but really you're just surrounded by dressed up teenage girls out for a \"night on the town.\"   Should you go out of your way to go to the Cheesecake Factory? No. Should you go here if there is no where else to go? Also no.",

We were quickly greeted by our servers who made us feel welcome and get us drinks and appetizers. This was my first time visiting any Cheesecake Factory and was so surprised and overwhelmed by their menu. They have so many dishes that sounded amazing and made it extremely hard to pick one. I decided to go with the Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta as I learned many of my group went with too. The dish was excellent and very tasty. It was not that spicy as I would have hoped for but it was still good. I was stuffed by the end of it as their dishes are pretty big but knew that I needed to try their cheesecake. I was looking for their seasonal peppermint one and was pretty disappointed to not see it on the menu so I went with my second choice, the tiramisu cheesecake, which was delicious and combined my favorite two desserts perfectly. I wish I could have gotten an espresso with a twist which would have complimented the dessert so well. Overall, it was a wonderful experience as the staff even sang for me. Their menu is a bit pricey especially if you want to get an app, a drink, and dessert as a couple of us did but it is worth it.",

I went with the vegan cob salad which was very good!  My boyfriend was able to get a pasta dish made vegan for him which he loved as well. The service has always been pretty good here despite them being busy all the time. Before I was vegan I use to get the cheesecake for dessert but now that i'm vegan i'm a little bummed I couldn't get one. Maybe one day they will have a vegan cheesecake (one can hope!). Free street parking. Waited 10 minutes to be seated. Did some window shopping at the local stores after dinner.",

Keep your expectations at bay this isn't Michelin star quality but it's consistent and that wins out most of the time. The menu is ridiculous and hard to follow along it resembles a phone book in thickness (if anyone even knows what a phone book still is) with non food items.   I recommend the factory chop salad.",

They now have smaller pasta portions in addition to their light caloric meals. Even their plating has improved. I usually order the Tex Mex egg rolls and they are plated much better now considering the price.   Then there is the cheesecake. Well, it's great. The options seem endless and I haven't had one I don't like yet. I recently just started eating cheesecake and this is actually where I had my first piece, the key lime pie one.   I'll keep coming back.",

I tend to come here at about 2 or 3pm on a weekend day. I won't waste my time by coming when it's crowded and waiting for an hour. At that point it's just not worth it.  I love the guacamole that they will prepare to taste, depending on how spicy you like it. I also enjoy the lunch salads, which are always huge. The only difference I have found between the lunch and dinner salads is the meat portion. Otherwise, they are exactly the same size.  As far as entrees go, I enjoy the Crusted Chicken Romano, the Pasta da Vinci, and the Miso and Herb Crusted Salmon. The Luau and Barbeque Chicken Salads are go to items for me as well.  To finish, if I'm not overly stuffed, I love the strawberry shortcake. It's loaded with strawberries and is perfect for sharing. I also really enjoy the Coconut Cream, Banana Cream, and Pina Colada cheesecakes. If you are a chocolate person, I would recommend the Godiva or Chocolate Mousse Cheesecakes.  As far as chains go, CF is a dependable choice. There is something for everyone, so it's great for a large group, especially when picky eaters are involved. I mean, who doesn't love cheesecake?",

As we sat there for 10 minutes, we saw 8 different groups come in and be seated immediately.  Some the same as us, groups of two.  A group of four and a group of three too.  All got seated before us as we stood there, 10 feet away.  We could see empty tables from where we're standing.  The hostess looked at us several times and simply ignored us.  I love the Cheesecake Factory and I was looking forward to it, but never again at this location.  We went across the street to the Hofbrauhaus House and enjoyed their wonderful food for the first time (they sat us immediately).  Horrible customer service.",

The food is never too die for but you get big portions and the staff is usually very friendly and attentive.  The 5 of us split two apps.. Chicken and mushroom lettuce wraps and avocado egg rolls. Both pretty tasty and it was a good amount to share between us and leave room for dinner.  We all liked our meals too, my aunt was disappointed in the white chicken chili bc they said it wasn't spicy and it was and they also said it came with a side of rice. Well the rice was about a tablespoon on her soup. So that was far from truthful.  Normally I like to try places that aren't chain restaurants, so when I read the menu here, which is almost TOO big, I sometimes get disappointed because it's almost like they try too hard to make different dishes. Hard to explain but I'm sure a lot of you feel the same.  Once again, I didn't leave room for dessert. I do however recommend their red velvet cheesecake from the last time I was there.  I also recommend the Cajun chicken littles and Cajun pasta with chicken asparagus peas and peppers.",

I'd never been to a Cheesecake Factory restaurant before yesterday and certainly had no complaints about this one.  This restaurant, in SouthSide Works' beautiful Town Square, couldn't have scored a better location.  I doubt they're ever hurting for business!  Your parking garage or valet ticket, by the way, can be validated here.  My opinion is that The Cheesecake Factory is a place for burgers and sandwiches and salads and the obvious--cheesecake!  That being said, we stuck to inexpensive menu items and were very happy with our food.  I just don't see \"The Cheesecake Factory\" as a place where I'm merrily going to drop over $20 for a lunch or dinner entree.  That's silly to me; there are numerous delicious nearby places where one can enjoy a more lavish meal.   My mother, brother, and my brother's fiancee all seemed to love their yummy-looking food, but my boyfriend's \"Sonoma Burger\" (from the \"Glamburgers\" section of the restaurant's massive menu) was particularly delicious.  Super-juicy, maybe a bit too greasy, and topped with thin red onions, oven-roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, arugula, herbed goat cheese, and mayo.  I haven't had a burger in years, but this one made me reconsider my burger-eating frequency.  I also loved my \"Factory Chopped Salad,\" loaded with ingredients.  My only issue--and shame on the chef!--was that the bitter hard avocado used was days away from being ripe, yuck.    Our server John was kind, helpful, and attentive.  Nice guy.  You know, it does bother me that--and it's no secret--The Cheesecake Factory generally serves super-unhealthy dishes.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FYahoo.com&s=f56fae19b401e3ddfaf38693804ff1fb8bbda0e858ba5f7cae73f384c0ea8de1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Yahoo.com</a> is my computer home page, and each time a \"Top 10 Unhealthy Restaurant ____\" article is featured, Cheesecake Factory menu items are all over the list.  Sort of bums me out, but then again the place IS called \"The Cheesecake Factory,\" which doesn't particularly conjure thoughts of healthful eating.  When dessert time rolled around yesterday we were stuffed and, thank goodness, avoided the featured red velvet cheesecake and its alternating layers of cheesecake and red velvet cake and cream cheese frosting glory.  It was very tempting though, as were basically all of the rich decadent cheesecakes this place has to offer.  A perfectly pleasant lunch experience in pretty SouthSide Works!",

I was there once at closing- the waitress (who was great) was a little slow with the check and I was admittedly slow giving it back, so by the time I got it back, they were officially closed.    I sat to calculate the tip and two guys come by to clean the table next to mine and remark loudly \"Man, where did the music go? Oh that's right, we're CLOSED!\"  That whole thing was completely unnecessary, and the worst is that the manager was there and said nothing.  I've worked in food service and retail, so I get it, but I have never shopped anywhere, eaten anywhere, or worked anywhere where people acted like that.    I complained to the manager about it today and he was very much apologetic, which I appreciated-hence the three stars instead of two.",

    "text": "We were excited to visit The Cheesecake Factory, neither one of us has ever been there.  Unfortunately, my wife has a severe allergy to ground black pepper, she has had this for 6 years now.  We have gone to hundreds of restaurants all over the country, without any issues, as long as we inform our server.    We informed our waitress of the allergy upon arrival; she comes back 5 minutes later and informs us that the manager said \"we don't have anything for you to eat here, except for maybe a house salad\".  We were totally appalled, normally if they don't have anything on the menu, or they were worried, the manager/owner would come over and make something off the menu.  So, needless to say, we left immediately.  One bright note, we walked around the corner and had a wonderful dinner at McCormormick and Schmicks Seafood.  They had no problem accommodating my wife's allergy.",

We had dinner for 7, including more cocktails, appetizers, entrees, and desserts to go.  Our total was about $300, before tip.  Unfortunately, the web site lists the menu but not the costs.   The table cosmos did not taste the same as those made in front of us at the bar.  The lemon drop and mojito were adequate.     TEX MEX EGGROLLS (Spicy Chicken, Corn, Black Beans, Peppers, Onions and Melted Cheese. Served with Avocado Cream and Salsa.) FRIED CALAMARI (Fried Light and Crisp. Served with Garlic Dip and Cocktail Sauce.) BEET AND AVOCADO SALAD (Glazed Beets, Avocado, Fresh Orange, Arugula, and Honey-Yogurt Sauce.) AHI TARTARE (Raw Tuna with Avocado and Soy-Ginger Sesame Sauce)  Appetizers were all tasty.  Ahi was tiny.    Entrees were good as well.  Listing calories for each dish on the menu is a nice touch, as is offering a menu limited to \"skinny\" choices.   Weather outside was warm.  Restaurant was warm.     Our server was energetic.  At least twice, while moving past us, she said:  \"How is everything?  Good?\"  That's 2 questions at once.  Are there other answer choices?",

The service was good but the restaurant felt a little dirty for a Saturday afternoon. The bread and water could have been filled faster. The food was fresh and quick and the portions, as always, are ginormous! I order off the lunch menu and still end up splitting the meal. The mandarin chicken salad is my go-to with dressing on the side. Always save room for cheesecake. This location is unique in that there is space to dock a boat on the river - great stop for lunch and to escape the sun while boating.",

Just like with the other locations, the quality of food is great and the staff is friendly. Their cheesecake is unbelievably delicious! I got a new flavor called Hazelnut that tasted just like Nutella. I really enjoyed the graham cracker crust, hazelnut pieces in the cheesecake and nutella spread ontop. Aside from the cheesecake, their food is also very good. My personal favorite is the chicken parm sandwich. Portion sizes are large so you usually have enough for leftovers, especially if you want to save room for dessert. While you're waiting they bring warm bread to your table, just don't fill up on its goodness. Overall a great place to go with friends or family.",

I'd definitely recommend going at this time-- the brunch menu is available until 2 pm on Saturdays and Sundays, which is an added bonus. I order the same thing almost every time-- the barbecue ranch chicken salad. Delicious and packed full of chicken, black beans, avocado, tomatoes, corn and crispy fried onions.",

    "text": "After years of talking about going here, I finally got to go for my birthday and it surpassed my expectations by a long shot. There was a group of us so I had to wait 3 hours for a table (on a Saturday) and I must say, it was well worth the wait. It's beautiful inside. I love the ceiling art and the low lighting at each table. It kind of reminded me of Greece though I have never been. It was very crowded but hosts were very sufficient in getting people through. They were more patient than I was because I kept bugging them about how much longer I had to wait and they politely told me an estimate each time.   When we finally got seated, we were asked right away what our drinks and appetizers would be. They were understanding of how long we had to wait and made quite an effort to make sure very little time was spent waiting. Our waitress also made me feel very special as she seemed excited to hear it was my birthday, though there were 10 other birthdays that night which I thought was so funny.   I pretty much blinked and our drinks and appetizers were already there. I had the crab and artichoke dip and the fried Mac n cheese. Wow. I should've just ordered the dip for my meal because I just couldn't get enough of it. The fried Mac and cheese came with a red sauce which I thought was very unique and flavorful. For my meal, I had the shrimp gumbo. That was also really good but by the time I got to it, I was already full on the appetizers so lucky for me, I had some to take home. For desert, I had a plain cheese cake with strawberries and i also didn't have room in my belly for that but everything I took home, tasted great the next day. Lastly, they have the best raspberry lemonade I've ever tasted and I have had a lot of lemonades.   I definitely wanted to go back as soon as I left because there were so many other great choices of food that I didn't get to try. My boyfriend didn't get to come but after he heard me talk about my experience, we decided that we're going to go there for his birthday too.   This is random but I wish they sold that crab and artichoke dip in a container. I don't think I want crab any other way now.",

The crispy lettuce and hot juicy chicken along with the crunchy carrots paired perfectly with all the delectable sauces. My favorite was definitely the green one.

For vegetarians, I recommend their Kale Falafel salad. For an appetizer the avocado egg rolls are honestly one of the tastiest things I've ever had. Also, once my friend had some kind of grilled cauliflower? something like that. It was so so good.   It's a BIT pricey for the quality of the food and the restaurant itself.   I think it's their color scheme with the dim lighting that bums me out-like the combo of the two. If they had a better color scheme I would like it more.",

The wait was nearly non-existent which shocked us since this location is always busy but after we ordered our food, the place started to get crazy busy. Yay for beating the dinner rush! The menu is massive and a bit overwhelming but we chose to do appetizers and a slice of cheesecake. I picked the fried macaroni and cheese balls which are served over marinara sauce. The hubby chose the buffalo blast which is buffalo chicken dip in fried wrappers. Both were soooo good and filling. For dessert, I chose the white chocolate raspberry truffle cheesecake and he had the caramel pecan turtle cheesecake. All our food was fantastic and our waiter was decent (hence just the 4 stars).",

    "text": "Not sure how I made it 27 years without ever going to a Cheesecake Factory, but I'm glad I finally had the CF experience!   My boyfriend and I ventured to this location while traveling in Pittsburgh, as it was within walking distance from our hotel & we had a gift card burning a hole in our pocket (wallet).   Walking in the CF, everything is just big- the ceilings are high, there are huge columns and entryways into the different areas- I swear, even the booths and tables seemed bigger than in other restaurants. Our server seated us in a booth in a room off the main area which was nice because it was a little quieter.   Honestly I was not prepared for the menu. It was like a book! We started off with drinks and the build your own lettuce wrap appetizer which came with three different sauces. I liked this a lot because it was kind of like a craft. For my entree I ordered a southwestern salad with tomatoes, avocado, black beans and corn with a cilantro lime dressing that had a lot of zest to it. Everything was great! Sadly, we saved no room for the iconic cheesecake.",

I absolutely love coming here but the downfall is I basically need somebody to Uber me home because I don't want to move after eating. There are so many different flavors of cheesecake but honestly my all time favorite has to be traditional cheesecake with strawberries. The key lime is a close second, and the white chocolate raspberry is third. The food is delicious as well but a little pricy. I got a wedge salad and it wasn't bad but I'd probably get something different next time, or simply pig out on dessert!",

The menu is very diverse, so no matter who you are, what you can or cannot eat, there will be an option. The drink menu, too, is one of the largest I've seen. They are also accommodating with any meal preferences (I.e dressing on the side, no meat, etc.). The waitstaff is friendly and prompt. The atmosphere is iconic with the dim lighting and Cheesecake Factory interior. In simple, when you go to the Cheesecake Factory, you know what you're going to get. The prices are a little bit higher than I would place the value, but the portions are large, and it's a great place to go with any size group. I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "As far as chain restaurants go, Cheesecake Factory is among the better choices you'll find. Yes, the menu is ridiculously large. Yes, the wait for a table is ridiculously long, but you're typically in for a decent meal...especially when you eventually find those one or two dishes that actually resonate with your own taste buds. Of course, that's not an easy task.  It's a good place to take people because they have something for every taste in their menu, but until you find some go-to choices, you could easily be disappointed, as my wife and I will tell you...it's hardly worth the hour or hour-and-a-half wait, but without the wait, it's a great place for a quick bite.  Also, even when you find your favorite dish, a great meal is never guaranteed. For me, the orange chicken is excellent, but it's a 50-50 toss-up whether or not they'll get my side right. I simply ask for STEAMED carrots, as I can't stand the oily vegetables the meal usually comes with, but I'm often served exactly the side I described disliking upon ordering. Generally, the wait staff that I have is nice about it, and immediately fixes it, but it's still frustrating that they get it wrong so often.  Known for their epic portions, and yummy cheesecake, neither are misleading reputations. Most meals, even in lunch portion, are so gluttonous that you'll likely be taking leftovers with you. Especially at the cost, you're not going to want to just waste your meal.  Aside from the few issues that I've mentioned, I've had way more positive meals and experiences at Cheesecake Factory than not. They do a surprisingly good job with almost every dish, and considering the numerous cooking styles the chefs are responsible for preparing, that's an impressive feat. It's generally a safe bet for a decent meal. Not to mention, I do like quite a few of their appetizers. The ahi carpaccio, although a little heavy on the sauces, is really good, as are the factory nachos and avocado eggrolls. My other favorite thing is the unsweetened iced green tea. I can drink that all day.   Regardless, you're probably only there for dessert anyway, and that's the one area that I've never been disappointed in. Best cheesecake ever? I wouldn't go anywhere near that far, but it's as rich and fulfilling as you'd expect, and should please the majority.",

    "text": "Holy menus Batman!! For those of you that have never tried the Cheesecake Factory, their menu is.....extensive. It's my personal belief that if your menu needs page numbers, you have too many things on the menu, but what do I know? The thing about CF is you have to remember their thing is cheesecake and they do that well. It's hard for me to say they do it any better than that, because really, I don't like cake, even ones made of cheese. As for the food, they have a ton of options and they are consistent. If you find something there you love, more than likely you will love it every time.  Like I usually get a pizza or this chicken BBQ salad which rocks! But is HUGE!   Because we had stopped by before going to the movies, we were eating rather light. Two of us got the pizza and salad lunch for about $13.00, which was really reasonable considering the pizza is a decent size, AND you get to choose from any pizza toppings you want; I chose the chicken BBQ. Mmmmmm! The salad was literally just greens and a couple tomato quarters...not as Mmmmmmm. The BF got the lunch size meatloaf, which was not really to his/our liking. It comes smothered in gravy and onions, and I am an anti-onion person. Everyone got desert- cheesecake, of course- and the best by far was the salted caramel. Coming in a close second was the raspberry lemon, which was very refreshing and, because it has a cake layer (or something, I can't really remember) it is one of the least bad for you, calorically speaking. The Hershey's chocolate was a dud. Just really chocolatey without any charm or pizazz.   My parting advice would be to check out the menu on line BEFORE going, to narrow down you options, so you don't go into menu shock when you get there (seriously, it's like 14 pages).",

I went in after and waited for the hostess to ask her about it. She sent out our server who explained it was a shift change, it was right before 5pm, so she didn't know they sat us. That's understandable but more organization and communication would have started our dinner off on a better foot. After that our server was efficient and attentive. The fried zucchini starter was very good but our entrees were okay (shrimp basket and chicken di pana). The cheesecake is delicious here.

The decor and vibe of the whole place was very sophisticated and pleasing to look at. We waited probably about 45 minutes just for our appetizers to come, and I got the fried mac and cheese bites. They were pretty good, but they were burnt. The bread they served was pretty stale. It felt like an eternity waiting for our main dish. My sister's boyfriend got the wrong meal several times, and my meal (which I believe was a penne four cheese pasta with chicken) was salty, the sauce was horrible and the chicken was pretty soggy. My brother got a burger that was meant to be medium rare and he got well done, as well. The staff treated us like little children. The cheesecake was pretty okay, but it was pretty much the same thing you could get from the grocery store. We got our bill reduced due to mistakes, and it somehow still came out to be about $300. Overall, very mediocre for such a high price.",

Yum!  I never have room for cheese cake after- so we order some to take home! It is a bit expensive, but worth it. The Godiva chocolate is phenom, so was the cookie dough slice.   Our servers have always been nice and accomodating, with good recommendations and give you plenty of space to check out the extensive menu. ( for real, the menu is huge). You are also served a bread basket while you wait to munch on appetizers.   The ONLY thing that stops me from 5 stars, is that I have been there when the wait takes forever for food, or once my party of 5 placed orders at once and one order did not come for minutes after the rest of ours came.   Overall, a fun place with options for even the most picky of eaters. And the cheesecake? You cant go wrong!",

    "text": "I am not a fan of huge chain restaurants. Taco Bell? Barf. McDonalds? Bleh. Olive Garden? Ick. Panera Bread? I can make this stuff myself. Chipotle? ...Well, I actually like Chipotle, but you get the point. Essentially, what you get at chain restaurants can be hit or miss. The food might be good one day but terrible the next; one establishment might be clean and presentable while another might be deplorable; customer service--if any--might be excellent one night but completely lacking another night. Although I try to keep an open mind, having experienced this myself, I walked into The Cheesecake Factory with fairly modest expectations.  I usually do not visit The Cheesecake Factory unless there is a special occasion, such as a once-in-a-year family gathering, a birthday party, or a baby shower. It just so happened that one of my colleagues was having a lunchtime baby shower and this was the venue. So, I drove from Shadyside to Southside, met a little traffic, and parked my car in one of the garages without too much trouble. I walked into the restaurant. As expected, the entrance is very large, expansive, and modernesque, almost like walking into a super high-end shopping mall or a mansion. Ahead was the host/hostess station. I introduced myself and stated that I was there for a baby shower until my colleague's name. They found her name and directed me through the labyrinth of a restaurant all the way to the back and around the corner.  Okay! Let's see if I get lost...  After I found my group and exchanged pleasantries, I sat down and waited a couple minutes for our waiter. I ordered a mojito and a glass of water for the time being. I received the mojito, which looked and tasted quite good, but he seemed to have misplaced or forgotten my water. I never got a chance to flag him down until he came back who knows how many minutes later to take our food orders. I ordered a pizza and salad combo while my colleagues ordered pasta, steak, salads, and sandwiches. The food took about 20 minutes to arrive, which wasn't too bad considering our group was composed of 10 or so people. I got my water (yay!) and my food. The margherita pizza I ordered was supposedly a personal size pizza and the house salad I got was drizzled with balsamic vinaigrette. Both tasted quite good, but were very large, which was the norm at The Cheesecake Factory. I ate my salad first before moving onto the pizza, of which I managed to eat two slices.  During our meal, several of us wanted to get boxes for their leftovers, but our waiter was nowhere to be found. We ended up having to wait until the very end of our meal when our waiter suddenly appeared to ask how our meal was and if we would like some dessert. Some of us ordered dessert while the rest of us requested boxes. The cheesecakes that came out looked divine; alas, I didn't order any because I had eaten and drunk too much. Finally, getting each of our bills didn't take too long. We boxed our food, washed up, and left the restaurant feeling much too stuffed.  Overall, the food and drinks were quite good. There was no hair or odd treasures to be found in the food, and no floaty things in our drinks. My only gripe is the outrageous portion sizes, even for lunch! One slice of cheesecake could feed a family of three or four! Only in America...  Service lacked somewhat, however. The waiter could have given us a bit more attention in addition to the typical ordering, delivery, and payment collection processes.  As I have stated in the beginning, I will not come to The Cheesecake Factory unless there was a special occasion. Supersize portions and flaky customer service are just not for me.",

I ordered over $100 worth of take out. Once I got the food home, I noticed that the avocados were missing from both of the chicken and avocado salads. I called the restaurant and spoke to Jason. To start, Jason voiced that they only add 2 ounces of avocados to a a salad that has avocados listed in the name.  He was rude and did not offer an apology for the error.  Jason then asked me to come back all the way from home to pick up my 2 ounces of avocados for each salad.  After I told him I was too far to return, he stated he would send me a gift card worth $20 for what he stated was for two slices of free cheesecake. He did not even care that I paid $15 for each salad and spent over $100 overall. He disregarded my cost and said he was only sending the card for the missing avocados. I told Jason his disregard was unprofessional and that I would write to corporate. He said to go ahead and started playing with the telephones buttons, pretending he was having phone issues, and hung up. Jason is not management material. Needless to say, I will not go back to this location as long as the restaurant is managed by a person who is clearly not cut out for management.",

    "text": "If I could give this Cheesecake Factory zero stars I would!  First the server loses our order, she said she can't read her own handwriting and has to retake our order.  The 2 appetizers we ordered took 45 minutes to come out.  I ordered an Apple martini, the server said they couldn't make one even though the bar looked to have every type of alcohol there is. So I ordered a margarita, it took so long to come out I  never ordered another one. The women's bathroom had a long line, so they had no TP in some of the stalls, no paper towels and the trash cans were overflowing with paper towels all over the floor.  We finally got our food, it was lukewarm, we didn't complain because we wanted to get out of there.  The server brings us our check and we noticed we were charged twice for one of our appetizers so she had to adjust our bill.  I'm.from Las Vegas, I'm in Pittsburgh visiting my fiance's family.  This CF reminds me of the tourist one at the Premium Outlet Mall that remains so busy the employees no longer give a damn about service.",

Easily enough for two meals, as all their food is. I hate breakfast potatoes so they offered me a side of tomatoes instead which, for me, was perfect. I would have liked a fruit salad option but I thought the tomatoes were a unique and satisfying accompaniment. We don't come often because my husband doesn't like their dinner but I've never disliked a meal here. The chicken and garlic noodles is my favorite lunch/dinner dish. Service is always standard. The cheesecake is pricey but worth the occasional splurge!",

    "text": "The Cheesecake Factory has good American food and is more upscale than your usual Applebee's or TGI Friday's. They have extensive food as well as drink menu - some of which are good and others not so much. The sandwiches and salads are tasty but I would stay away from their \"chinese\" food. My personal top orders are the Grande Burrito and Luau Salad. For appetizer, the Factory Nachos are the way to go. Warm, crunchy nachos with pulled chicken, salsa, sour cream, cheese, jalapenos, beans, guac and probably more. And of course their cheesecakes are very good - never had a bad one.  Getting a table there can be a long affair if you go during peak times so go during off hours if you can. The level of service is also directly correlated to how busy they are in my experience.   All in all, not a bad place if you're looking for a casual dining experience and some great cheesecake.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I am usually a big fan of the Cheesecake Factory. Despite the super crowded tables, I enjoy the food and the atmosphere. The service is never great, but that is something I have come to terms with. However, the Cheesecake Factory on the South Side had particularly TERRIBLE service when I went this weekend on Sunday night.   It wasn't terribly busy, and we were seated right away (party of two). After being seated, we were not approached for an entire ten minutes. We were beginning to think they forgot about us, but were glad when the waitress came. She took our drink orders (just water) and we asked for bread, and then we didn't see her for another ten minutes at least. When she came back, she brought two waters but no bread, claiming that there wasn't any ready despite all of the tables around us receiving bread continuously from their respective waiters/waitresses. She refused to take our orders when she dropped the drinks off, so we had to wait. She came back around five-ten minutes later, and without bread again. She finally took our orders. About ten minutes after that, she came back and asked what we ordered again, because she \"was confused\" and got things mixed up. At this time, we decided to ask another waitress for bread, who brought it out within two minutes. A little bit later, our waitress came back, still claimed no bread had been made (despite us having received some, but not from her), and asked us if we had seen a credit card or any receipts lying around or under our table. She insisted we look under our table. Apparently she had lost the credit card and receipt of one of the tables she was waiting on. When the food came out, it was perfect and we were very pleased with that. Throughout the entire meal, she did not refill out waters once, she brought us no bread, and when I asked her to box my food, she never brought it back. Overall she was the worst waitress I have ever had and I cannot believe that the Cheesecake Factory has her working there. She is a disgrace to the restaurant. I will probably not return because I am so infuriated with how we were treated. We asked to speak to a manager and were told that there was not a manager present. I will likely try calling to inform them.",

We got the cake to go and did not do sit down service. I got the chocolate tower truffle cake. It was incredible. It had a fudgy layer, then airy bread, then very light mousse. The lightness of the cake with the heavier fudge made it a great combination. It was pleasant for the palate, not too heavy or too sweet. I asked for extra whipped cream. It was great to have extra whipped cream because the cream was not sweet. It was also neutral and light, which helped with eating the heavier fudge part of the cake. It also lasted me 6 days to eat everyday. Loved it!!! Such a good deal!",

My waitress was a young girl (I feel bad I forgot her name) but she was sweet and fun to talk to. Great service.   I took myself to the Southside location recently after a long day of shopping and was sat right away. Restaurant is always clean, comfortable, has friendly staff members, and DELICIOUS!   I can only imagine how lame it sounds to say that the free bread appetizer is my favorite part every time I come in, but really it is. I always look forward to it.  I ordered the tomato basil pasta dish and it was phenomenal, just heated up the leftovers tonight for dinner and it tasted just as good. Of course, I also enjoyed some cheesecake for dessert (strawberry this time around), and I swear they have the best cheesecake on this earth. I have never been let down by the Cheesecake Factory and I know I'll be back many times in my life.   Use to be one of my favorite date night spots and their sirloin with mashed potatoes is some of the best steak I've had in a long time that was under $40. Keep it up Cheesecake Factory!",

    "text": "If you like excess, this is your place!   It got three stars because of stellar service; but overall, I just can't get behind this concept.    Let's start with the menu, which has over 100 options easy.   That's just too many.  Way too many.  It's 20 pages or so plus an insert.  It takes forever to read through, forever to decide, and I'm always wishing I'd ordered something else.     Then there are the portions.  This place is why Americans are fat.  And not even in a good way.   I ordered a barbecue ranch salad.  $14.95...fine cause it does have chicken and the menu description looked yummy.  But this salad was so ridiculously excessive that our whole table could have shared one for dinner and been full.  I ate a lot and barely made a dent...and let's be honest, dressed salad just isn't good the next day.   There is no reason to serve 8 pounds of salad.  Ever.   Cut it in half (maybe even 3rds) and charge me ten bucks.  And don't get me started on the skinnylicious menu...getting a few items to come it at under 600 calories isn't anything to brag about.     The cheesecakes are good; but again, sort of excessive.   25 options or so to choose from and no option for a smaller portion.    My fave is the dulce de leche, which is amazing.  I do love it and would go back for it, but I'd probably skip the meal.     If you decide to go to this location, David was an excellent server.   He took our large party antics in stride and offered up a great time.   He alone (and maybe the dulce cheesecake) could have rated 5 stars.",

The Cheesecake Factory just intensifies my dislike for restaurant chains.    Now, let me whine, cry and complain. It's way too dark in there, how the heck am I supposed to read the menu? Are there sketchy stuff in the food that you guys don't want me to see? Also, it took nearly an hour for my food to arrive. My eating companions literally left the restaurant to walk around and when they came back, I'm still there nibbling on bread and butter. The frustrating part is that the restaurant was not even that busy. I got to try the avocado eggrolls, which were so bland. The Bang-Bang Chicken and Shrimp dish, which was just a super sweet curry dish. It looks kind of gross, but tastes ok. The Spicy Chicken Chipotle Pasta was not even spicy at all, but was actually the most edible dish on the table.    Overall, the long wait really turned me off and the food was not that impressive. I recommend this place for the tasty cheesecakes, and ONLY the tasty cheesecakes.",

    "text": "The National Cheesecake Day deal was just too good to miss. I, being the sugar-addicted dessert aficionado that I am, had to visit not just once, but twice. If I lived closer I probably would have gone for all four meals during the two-day promotion.  Overall, the service was timely, professional, and attentive. The decor, atmosphere, and layout are that of a typical Cheesecake Factory: could be great for a date, but no one cares if you show up in a t-shirt and jeans. The quality of the food is great, but the prices are a little high for it to be more than the occasional treat (especially for a college student). The menu is very large, which can be a little overwhelming.  I stopped by on Friday afternoon around 2:30 pm with a friend. We were seated at a table outside within a few minutes. The complimentary bread was yummy; I prefer the honey wheat brown bread to the sourdough because it is softer. I ordered the roasted pear and blue cheese flatbread, and my friend got the avocado, zucchini, and portabella fries, which were served with two dips. These were considered \"small plates and snacks\" on the menu and cost $6.50 each. Without cheesecake, the portion sizes would not have filled me up. (But I guess that's the point, I've never gone to the Cheesecake Factory and not gotten cheesecake). I enjoyed my flatbread--it had a great, crunchy crust. The amount of toppings was perfect, although the flavor profile isn't one that I particularly cared for (just my tastebuds, though). My friend enjoyed her \"fries\" as well, especially the zucchini ones.   Then, of course, we ordered cheesecake. We split the new Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch and Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple. The Chocolate Hazelnut Crunch had a great, strong hazelnut flavor; however, I found myself missing the bitterness of the chocolate to balance out the sweetness. Adam's Peanut Butter Fudge Ripple was even sweeter, being loaded with candy bars and caramel. The plain cheesecake at the edge that didn't get the caramel swirl or candy bits was a relief.  I returned again on Saturday around 1 pm by myself. This time, I ordered the Tomato Mozzarella Toast, which was much more in line with my tastes. The crunchy bread was perfect, the tomatoes were sweet and juicy, and the pesto burst with flavor. Really delicious, if a little overpriced at $8.50.  After my sweetness overload from the previous day, I decided to go with the Tiramisu Cheesecake. The coffee provided the bitterness I was looking for; this one was not too sweet for my tastes. However, the cheesecake itself could have been richer.  So, bottom line: pretty good. If I'm going to be picky, food is pricey. Cheesecake flavors are cool, but I prefer richer cheesecakes that are more tangy than sweet. But they're good to satisfy my need for sugar. If it wasn't for the promotion, I wouldn't have visited, and I doubt I will soon if not for a special occasion.",

This location get super crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, Sunday brunch/lunch because it's super close to all the Universities and a magnet for families and groups.    The menu is your standard Italian and I personally like the service at this location over the North Hills Ross Park Mall version [home mall] where it's hit or miss. After you get past a possible wait it's smooth sailing, everybody pitches into the process from food running and clearing the table, refilling glasses and bringing bread. It's a machine. Awesome.  My favorite for this restaurant is the skinnylicious menu from drinks to salads and foods. I love the mix of asparagus as their go-to veggie and they even manage to sneak in a bunch of carbs in too whether some mashed potatoes [steak dish] or angel hair [shrimp-lemon with asparagus]. very good. PS: do chew your food and not engulf like I do... I completely understand how people can choke to death.  Of course get some cheesecake to go. We bought the Pecan Truffle [and a couple extra ingredients] goodness and the White chocolate Macadamian Nut. [Yum]. Just a hint - these do NOT work when you're sipping Apple Martinis. NO.

It's roughly the same price as an Applebee's or Olive Garden, but you get a much better experience for your money.  Consistent, freshly prepared dishes, with intense flavors and comically large portions.  Pleasant decor and atmosphere.  Very friendly and attentive staff.  Despite their name, it's a great place to come even if you don't like cheesecake.  It's got an endless menu with over 100 options, for every palette and preference.  Some companies are big, because they're big.  Other's are big, because they deserve to be.  Treat yourself to a Cadillac at Chevy prices.

Part of our table had some small pieces of food on it so I had to ask to have it re-cleaned. The waitress brought menus but then left to resume chatting with a group of other waitstaff.  We decided what we wanted - our waitress was still busy talking with her colleagues. We waived at her and got her attention.  Upon arriving she rather flippantly asked if we were really to order, because it took most people 20-30 minutes to decide what they wanted.  First, that's just nonsense.  Second, we were clearly ready or we would not have waived her over.  When our food arrived, one meal was given to the wrong person, so it had to be re-made.  It was an omelet and they rushed remaking it so the middle was not quite cooked all the way.  Amazingly just remaking an omelet took so long that it arrived as the rest of us were done eating.  My brunch sandwich arrived with brioche bread that was dry; most of the breakfast potatoes were so burned they were rolling around like inedible dice.  Neither the cook nor the serving staff noticed a thing.  No one came by to freshen coffee and the bill was not accurate.  Appreciated Manager Andy's efforts to make this right but they need to spend a lot more time training and monitoring employees.",

This is one of the few restaurants you will go to with a menu that shares shepherd's pie and sushi. I like their raspberry lemonade.",

    "text": "I love this place. I've been eating here for years, and have been a regular customer this summer. I've tried a variety of dishes: burgers, chicken tenders, buffalo chicken blasts, chicken romano, California cheesesteak... all delicious. The only one I didn't really care for was a pasta dish. I think it was a 3 cheese pasta. The chicken romano is my favorite and I've ordered it my last few visits. All of the dishes are a little pricey (chicken romano $17), but the portions are huge. I always have enough for lunch the next day.   Drinks are delicious as well, and I think the prices are comparable to other restaurants. About $10 per specialty drink (I recommend the Sangria and the Greorgia Peach). I don't drink much beer or wine, so I'm not sure about those.  Onto the cheesecake... the Hershey's cheesecake = omg. It's a chocolate lover's dream. I also like the 30th Anniversary cheesecake. And I've tried both of the peanut butter cheesecakes, the Oreo cheesecake, and the turtle cheesecake. All good, but not enough chocolate for me! Cheesecake is about $8 a slice. (Tip: take-out slices are smaller. So order a slice to eat there, and then box it up if you can't finish. Yeahhh maybe I'm greedy, but if I'm spending $8 on a slice, I want my money's worth!)  Overall, I spend about $50 each visit.  I'd say that service is pretty good here. This goes for all restaurants, people: if it's busy, service might be a little slower. That's the risk you take when you go out on a Saturday night. But I've been here multiple times and I can't say that the service has ever been terrible.  I agree with other reviews about the din. It can be hard to converse when it's busy. And they're right that the lighting is dim. But, like the Melting Pot, I think that's all part of the ambience.  There is outdoor seating in the summer, and I'm all about outdoor seating. But this summer, there have been bands playing in front of the restaurant, and the music was so loud that we couldn't converse. This is my one and only gripe with this restaurant. I'm guessing that the bands are booked by South Side Works or something and has nothing to do with the Cheesecake Factory. But I wish they'd stop! Other than that, I'm a big fan of this place.",

I ordered gf pasta tossed with veggies and pine nuts, enough for 3 portions. It was good and all of the vegetables were cooked nicely. The appetizer was tamale cakes topped with corn, avocado, and sour cream. They were tasty, but heavy and filling. For dessert I ordered the Godiva flour less cheesecake, the only gf cheesecake on the menu. It was great!  Drinks and wines are grossly over priced and the price is something like $10.89 or $7.50 ... Anything with cents in the price bugs me. There was only a 10 minute wait for a table and the ginormous bar was practically empty, and made out wait more comfortable.

The managers obviously take great steps to hire a friendly staff. Our waitress, Kim C., was so wonderful with us and really made our experience enjoyable.   I know I can always rely on quality food from the CF. The menu is very large and can be daunting if you don't know what you're in the mood for. I had a glass of red sangria and it was so delicious, the best part were the soaked apples in the bottom. For an entree, I ordered the Thai Lettuce Wraps and they were fabulous like always. It's a very filling meal and enough to share or to make into two meals, leaving you with leftovers.",

Sent the orders back. After a long wait they finally brough the replacements. One of the meals was completely undercooked (actually uncooked). To top things off one of our party has very strict dietary issues (which we made a point of letting them know when ordering) and cannot eat meat. His meal ended up having chicken in it!!!! How many strikes? 4!!!! Unreal. Waitress handled things correctly, unfortunately Management could not have been more cold and uncaring.

So the last two times I have gone to The Cheesecake Factory I went in and got cheesecake to go. I tried the Cookie Dough flavor and they aren't kidding-there was a lot of cookie dough. In fact there was very little cheesecake compared to cookie dough. It was clunky and I wasn't a huge fan. The second trip I got Key Lime cheesecake. It is amazing. It's definitely one of my top 2 favorites. It is tangy and has a little bit of zing to it. It is refreshing during the warmer weather. There is a huge list of flavored to try. I can't wait to try other flavors.",

The delicious fresh bread that comes out while you wait for your entree?  Honestly, I think it is all those things, but for me, it's the one page \"skinny\" menu with the low cal/low fat options.  These healthy creations are not only tasty, but the portions are nice, and you have several options.  The \"Skinnylicious\" menu ranges from salads, to fish, to pasta, to steak, to tacos.  And the list goes on.  So yeah, I go to the Cheesecake Factory and I'm not mad about it.    I'd be remiss if I didn't mention that they have an amazing assortment of cheesecake.  I don't usually partake, but often I'm talked into sharing a piece with a friend or a group, and I've had some damn good cheesecake here.  My favorite is Oreo or cookie dough.  Or dulce de leche.  Or mango.  Ok, so maybe I do partake in the cheesecake.  But cut me a break, I saved oh so many calories by ordering from the Skinnylicious menu!",
