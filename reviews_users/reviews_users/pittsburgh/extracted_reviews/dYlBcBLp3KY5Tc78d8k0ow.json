Only wish I could rate them on TripAdvisor as well. If you are near this place, you must EAT HERE! You won't be disappointed at all.

The waitress was standing there but did not greet us or acknowledge our presence. A fellow patron explained to us that you could sit wherever you wanted. We sat at the only available table and waited. After about five minutes we walked up to the bar area to realize that you placed your order at the counter. We placed our order and the waitress brought out our food. I ordered penne primavera, and the penne was overlooked. My husband ordered a sandwich plus a side of tots and a \"snack\" order of salsa from the \"snack\" portion of the menu. His sandwich and tots were decent, but the salsa was just a dish of salsa with no chips. He asked the waitress if he could have chips and she walked away. A man then came out with a small bowl of chips and told us that for future reference, you have to order chips separately but that he was giving them to us for free in case the menu was not clear. It felt a bit like an episode of curb your enthusiasm.  \"How can I eat salsa without chips\"?  At least give me a fork or spoon.  The waitress later came back to ask how the food was. I said that mine was ok and she walked away without asking any further question.",

My mouth is watering thinking about it now!   The place wasn't busy but my gosh do they do tons of take our orders. If I lived close by I would be ordering everyday! The staff is always so nice and helped us with ordering bc we couldn't make a decision and they even gave us a IC Light! It's the little things that mean so much now a days...  Also they pizzas are super good. We have the mushroom one and we have the guido. Both amazing. Takes longer to come out vs a sandwich but it's homemade so I can't be mad!!!

The wife & I finally made the trek across the city to Heidelberg to get our fix. What I can say is the food may possibly be even better.  We love the combination of BBQ sauce on our Mushroom pizza, song with the garlic butter crust. So scrumptious!!  Also it is during lent and Brick n Mortar was offering a lent menu, so of course I tried the catfish po'boy, and I'm so happy I did. The crunch on the fried catfish was awesome, accompanied with pickled cucumbers and onions on a warm pita, I'm drooling thinking about it a day later.  The best thing the wife likes,  is of course her loaded torts, which are like nachos but with pita chips and an array pickled veggies, corn salsa?, cheese and choose of meat. She loved eating them in because they were so nice and fresh & FAST!!!  Now there are only two tables, and probably 12 chairs around the outside of the room. Don't expect to have a 5 course dinner, but I will tell you this place should be in the running for best overall food in Pittsburgh, grab a quick bite or take out.  Don't be like me, and wait to go. Get yourself down to Heidelberg, and thank me later!!",

We really appreciated them making room for us to eat in the restaurant. The food was excellent. I personally had a pepperoni pizza. My friends had various wraps, salads and pasta. Highly recommend this to anyone who wants a delicious bite to eat. 12/10 would recommend. Thank you for your excellent service!",

They serve the burger with there own version of tortilla chips which were tasty. I recommend you get the corn salsa to go with it, very good!

Great flavor, fresh ingredients, and lots of options. Even free beer (granted it's only due to them not having a liquor license yet)!!  Very small interior, I see it as more of a take-out place, or small party sit-down. We went for dinner on Saturday and luckily snatched up a table for 4. We had sandwiches, chips and salsa, and pizza between the group. Everything was delicious.  If I was in this neighborhood, I'd eat here every day. I'd get all my pizzas here. I'd get my lunches to-go daily. I'd order extra and have a late night snack. I'd save some in my fridge and eat it for breakfast. It's just that good.",

The woman who answered the phone was very pleasant and informative, helping me with my selection. The food was ready in the amount of time she had stated. The inside of the restaurant was very small, with only a few tables and high tops and a small TV (with the Pens game on). I ordered the Sunshine Salad with Sweet Onion Vinaigrette and the Guido Sandwich. The salad dressing was probably the best part of the salad! I wished there had been a fruit component or a meat on it but the salad was good as it was. The sandwich? Delicious! A unique combination of Italian flavors that worked well together. The cinnamon and sugar \"Torts\" were a wonderful addition to the meal.  Will I try this place again? Absolutely. I originally had trouble narrowing down what I wanted as there were a variety of options - sandwiches, pizzas, burgers, hot dogs (WHAT!), salads, entrees..  I will be back!",

The salad was a great choice and getting the chance to try some local food!   The salad was delicious it came with bacon. Cheese, egg and I added some of their grilled chicken. The croutons are out of this world delicious. My daughter got a bacon wrapped hotdog and gave me the thumbs up with a smile so she enjoyed them. My husband landed on the Cuban sandwich.   They are expanding, and did I mention they gave us free alcohol! Talk about winning! The lady at the front was extremely patient and recommended things like sweet onion dressing I got! I may end up back here again before we leave! And apparently they deliver!!!",

The coleslaw is also quite good. Everything is just different enough to be interesting.  I look forward to coming sometime with the family. There is something for everyone.  The only downside is the cramped atmosphere with few tables and very narrow counter seating along the walls. There is barely enough room for your knees. I find the counter to be uncomfortable but usually end up sitting so that a party of one does not take up a table. Despite the less-than-ideal seating, I keep coming back.",

    "text": "Friendly people and simple recipes elevate this hidden gem of Heidelberg. Daily specials accompany an enthusiastic menu of sandwiches (served on pita or on ciabatta), burgers, dogs, pizzas, salads, and sides. Most orders come with a side of freshly seasoned pita chips, which are addicting enough to warrant an order on their own. Free flavored water and cheap glass bottles of pop add the extra effort of care from a restaurant that's already got a good thing going.  My favorites are the sandwiches on pita, or just about anything that has a sauce on it. A lot of the sauce-less sandwiches, though they have things like pickles or coleslaw, are still a bit dry especially when served on the thick and airy ciabatta. The portions are perfect and I've yet to show up and order something I didn't enjoy--though I'm a sucker for finding my favorites and sticking with them (Rastafarian, Flankenstein, Olympian, Fun Guy).  There isn't a lot of seating, but in the summer, there's a nice outdoor area. I haven't tried their food cart, but I'll be sure to check it out the next time I see them!",

Also, the cheesy breadsticks with the mortar sauce earned rave reviews from my gf. Minor issue is the tots were incredibly salty, but I got them with garlic aioli so that balanced it a bit.  The only reason I gave 4/5 is simply due to options. Yes, they have entrees like hot dogs, pizza, and pasta, but gf is vegan and we found incredibly limited options, though that is kinda typical. We were able to get her the bruschetta with pita, which she enjoyed, but it was one of only 2 or 3 things she could have.   Overall, really enjoyed this and would order again in a heartbeat. If they could expand vegan/vegetarian options that would be great but even if they don't, I'll eat here/order from here again!",

The burger was cooked perfectly and seasoned ok, but could use more salt/pepper. The pickled onions were tangy if you got one by itself, but like the pickles(pickled cucs), didn't bring much taste (maybe need more?). The chipotle catsup was amazing. It was so much better than regular catsup because of the mild (my wife would say medium) heat. I would put this on everything!  The brioche bun held up to the juicy burger right to the end.   This was an excellent burger and tots make everything better. Next time I'm out here, I'll def come back.   Burger, tots, water bottle plus 20% tip $17.30. Decent price for such good quality.

    "text": "Located on 50, or Washington Pike, or Railroad St, or whatever variation of \"the main road that goes through Heidelberg\" you'll find Brick N' Mortar, the...well...brick and mortar location of the Burgh Bites food truck.    When I stopped in yesterday, my girlfriend and I decided to split some items. Their Penne (with vodka sauce), the Sunshine salad, and falafel. Of note-the restaurant is BYOB so we brought our own bottle of Finger Lakes wine (shameless drop of my favorite wine area), but they do have one tap it seems of beer from their neighbor, Insurrection Brewing.   First food out was the falafel. 4 2 to 2.5\" disks of very tasty falafel. It was a little on the crumbly side, but whatever. That's what forks are for. Next came the salad and pasta. The vodka sauce was wonderful. Creamy with just a hint of that vodka flavor with noodles that were how I like them. The portion was also huge. We split our fair share but still brought some home. A great deal for the price. Salad wise it was just as large as the pasta, and we got two dressings to try - a mustard vinaigrette and their balsamic vinaigrette. I just went mustard while there, which was a wonderful addition I would get again and the balsamic is waiting for me to have with the remainder of salad for lunch.   I suppose my one limited gripe would be rather uncomfortable seats. It's not a large space, good for take out for sure, but if you do eat there you won't be leaning back much. I noticed they had a small outdoor seating area I'd love to try when it's not cool and rainy out, maybe once spring rolls back around!",

Most recently just ordered a couple of burgers for take out with my kid.  I ordered The Godfather but my kid ended up taking it so I had the Notorious PIG that he ordered.  Anyway, I really enjoyed the burger even thou I would not have originally ordered.  Surprised at how good and juicy the burger was with some chipotle braised pork shoulder, crispy bacon, cheddar jack cheese and truck pickles.   Some of the items on this menu are just a mouthful of flavor and the food is well prepared.  Now I am looking to try the Lent menu.",

I had the Olympian, which was a delicious Greek wrap! Their tortilla chips are the perfect combination of salty and a little bit sweet! Perfectly paired with the mango corn salsa! The friendly staff & delicious food makes me want to come back again!",
