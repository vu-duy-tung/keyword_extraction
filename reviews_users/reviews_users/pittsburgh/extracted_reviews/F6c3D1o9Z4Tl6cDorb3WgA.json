I've been here twice already and am so impressed. It is everything a True Pittsburgher loves about the Eat n Park salad bar, except more delicious options! They also serve burgers and grilled cheese, which I'm dying to try on another visit. They have several salad options you can select and have made for you or you can go custom and walk through the bar and select your toppings yourself. I haven't done the latter yet, but my husband has and has been very satisfied with it. The portions are HUGE. You get an extra deep bowl of all your salad fixings perfectly chopped and mixed together to ensure you don't get that end of the salad blues where all you have left is lettuce because you've eaten everything else off the top. They also serve french fries that are SO GOOD. They come in a bag and are more than enough to share.",

    "text": "I LOVE THIS PLACE!!  Just went for the first time today, and boy, I really enjoyed it.  My semi- niece suggested we go, she having been previously, and me willing to try anything once.  She'd mentioned the make-your-salad option as well as the burgers, sandwiches, and sides, so I figured I knew what to expect.  However, WRONG!!  I expected the usual serve yourself salad bar, and I thought maybe I'd try a burger instead...until I saw the salad set-up, and I knew I had to have one.  First, though, the place is small with quite limited seating.  I imagine that when the place is really busy, getting a table could be quite the cutthroat proposition!  Fortunately, it wasn't so bad on this Sunday afternoon after 1:30pm.  There was a line of maybe 8 people ahead of us, but it went surprisingly quickly.  So, the salad process...they pull out a clear plastic bowl about the size of a child's sand bucket, and you select your greens from half a dozen huge bins.  I went with regular iceberg, and they packed it into the sand pail.  While you pay an extra $2 for your protein, I went with chicken.  Then you get unlimited toppings--dozens of options--and I added on a lot of them!  Even some red quinoa and roasted beets.  So I'm eyeing this overflowing sand pail and thinking, if I even BEGIN to mix in the dressing, I'm gonna have salad spread from one end of the table to the other...And then another employee took my sand pail and asked if I wanted small, medium, or large bites, to which I replied \"????\".  Turns out they use these rocker blades to chop the salad to various bite sizes.  Being new to this, I want with medium to be on the safe side.  Then, wonder of wonders, they have you choose your dressing {of many}, ask if you want it light, medium or heavy, scrape your salad into a huge bowl, pour on the dressing and MIX IT UP FOR YOU, then put it back into your sand pail!  Now how cool is that!!  I think it's a great concept.  I also got a cup of potato soup, which was purely awesome!  They have Pepsi products rather than Coke, which always makes me sad, but I muddled through.  Although the place is way out of my way, I definitely will go back.",

    "text": "I came here a long time ago when they first opened and got a veggie burger. I asked them to cook it very well, almost overcooking it. But when I got it home to eat, it was an undercooked mush burger on a bun. It was absolutely terrible and got thrown away.  Thus, I got turned off from the whole place.  However, yesterday I met a friend for salads. My first thoughts were that it's ridiculously loud inside and the line for ordering gets really long, requiring anyone who wants to use the restroom to battle through those trying to order.  It seems like a poor set-up to me.  That said, I thoroughly enjoyed my salad. There are endless options and the salads are huge, making them very well worth their cost. In fact, I came again this afternoon for another salad. While there seems to be a little inconsistency with chop size and topping amounts, this can all be dealt with individually.  I will definitely be back for salads in the future, but would pass on the other items.  4/21 Update:  I've bumped my review down. I went today for my salad, which I haven't had in about a month. I immediately noticed the bowls were a good bit smaller than previously, but the price was every bit the same.  They pack the bowls so high with lettuce that any toppings I requested were falling off.  Last, they no longer allow me to get my cheese after the chopping. I like my cheese in larger chunk form so I can taste it, not obliterated in the small chop.  I don't really have a reason to go back.",

    "text": "There are many reasons why I choose to skip Hello Bistro but first let me start with some positive thoughts. I do like that you can design your own salad and it seems to be enough salad for two meals. That about sums up what I like about this restaurant.  On my last visit there seem to be a lot of people just sitting at the tables waiting for their orders. The tables were sticky and not clean at all. The noise level in this restaurant drives me insane. There are few restaurants like this in Pittsburgh that I choose to not eat in because of how loud they are and this one is the loudest. I suppose noise level is hard to control when the restaurant is a cement block that has metal table and metal seats. In fact the food is even served on metal trays, sort of reminds me of a prison.  As far as the quality of the food, there is a lot to be desired. The sauces are bland and the fries are very greasy. It is a real turn on to have fries served in a greasy paper bag.  With so many other choices around I do not see myself or my family eating at Hello Bistro again.",

Ok, bottom line is I love this place...however; I was a little disappointed in the amount of toppings they put on my salad. I had the build-your-own salad and sure, I could have asked them to put more of whatever I wanted, but they were super skimpy. My experiences in other locations came with bountiful salads full of all the fixins. I think if I'm paying $11 for a salad, you better load that thing full of all the roasted beets, quinoa, and cucumbers you can stuff in it!   A lady who appeared to be the manager was friendly and running hot food to tables. Nice touch to the usual stand-and-watch managers usually encountered.   I'll definitely go back so here's you're heads up to make sure you stop skimping on those toppings!",

This isn't our first time here and it's by far the \"smallest\" salads we've ever had (by small I mean toppings - always PLENTY of lettuce lol).  $24 for 2 chicken salads and 2 drinks. Decent enough.

It looks like (and is) seven small pieces of chicken.   Wow, what customer service! Is this how eat n park became the Pittsburgh icon that it is? Or maybe the manager with a died purple mohawk is not representative of an iconic company! How about hiring professionally looking and acting people for management positions. How about training management in customer service.   Speaking of hiring...the teenage girl that made my salad was twirling her ponytail over all of the toppings while several teenage boys watched her while their jeans were falling off their back sides. Maybe the purple mohawk manager could have asked the butt showing boys to sweep up all of the crap under the counters while the girl put her hair up under a ball cap or even a HAIR NET!

My husband has a shellfish allergy, and they do have shrimp on the toppings bar, so we notified them immediately.  Yet the cashier in no way notifies the person making the salad, so saying something is worthless   Not to mention dirty tables and trash everywhere.

I also ordered a side of homemade fries, and although they were a little greasy for me, the taste was delicious. We struggled to find seating though since it was crowded, and I would say it is not a very conducive atmosphere for anything more than a casual meet up. This is my first time here, and I definitely will be coming again. It's new around my area and I'm super happy they are here and spreading!",

    "text": "I tried this place again after previously giving up on them over a year ago, as I needed something quick while in that area.  I should have kept to original plan to avoid them.  I ordered a salad.  The salad maker takes a plastic bowl & asks what type of greens I wanted, so I pointed to one tub that had a mixture of Spring Mix & Iceberg (I prefer 100% Spring Mix, but they still don't offer that).  I told her to take some out so there'd be space for other things. And truth be told - there's a nice selection of some decent items to add in - it's just that they try to be so stingy with these things as though they were putting diamonds in there.  There is all manner of typical raw salad vegetables, cheeses, grilled vegetables, \"crunchies\" (as they called them), dressings (not stingy with that), and protein (the one add-in that costs extra).  I selected shrimp & the portion was an itty-bitty scoop that cost $3 - a very shrimpy portion of shrimp.  After it was all together, they offered to chop it.    The salad is fine.  I thought it's vastly over-priced, especially the shrimp add-in.",

    "text": "Hello Bistro is one of my favorite go to places. Only bad thing is I somehow keep moving away from one that's close, right after it opens! Boo! But the trip is worth it.   The best way to describe this is a salad bar and a burger place had a baby. You can order pre-arranged salads and burgers off the menu, or you can create your own salad with whatever toppings you choose. Kinda of like a subway for salads. I always get the Buffalo chicken salad, no blue cheese and extra buffalo sauce, and it is hands down my favorite buffalo chicken salad! It's so fresh and I love that they mix the dressing and buffalo sauce right in the salad before they serve you.   They also have amazing fresh cut fries that I suggest to anyone! Only other item I've had here is a turkey burger with their pineapple salsa on top(forget the exact name,sorry!) everything is always good!   Only thing I don't like is how small the seating space is. This place gets PACKED! and it becomes kinda cut throat to get a table since it's is self seating. Basically have to stalk out where you wanna sit and wait for the people to clear. Other than that, I love this place!",

    "text": "I love Hello Bistro!  Their salads are yummy with vastly different pre-created concoctions for those who have a hard time being creative in making their own salad.  The portions are HUGE. But not big enough to share because once you start eating it, you won't want to share, nor will you stop eating after being full. You will keep eating until it's all gone. At least, that been my case every-time I go.   Their $2 hand cut fries are a must! I almost want to say, they are my favorite fries next to in-n-out fries. Get some of their ranch dip and dip your fries. You will thank me ;)  Their burgers are really good too! Freshly made to order. So good!   For the calorie counters out there, there's a pdf nutrition guide online. Turns out one of my go-to salads is a gut bomb... Oh well... Thankfully there's about 3million different salads to make/choose from :)",

The staff seems pretty new, and disorganized. As far as the salads, my husband got the Cobb Salad and I made my own.. both were good. You have to prompt if you would like a little more of the toppings because it is A LOT of lettuce and very small toppings.. especially if you only ask for a few different ones. Overall, it's a good place to get a salad that you customize but don't go here if you're looking for the best salad you've ever had.",

    "text": "I have never been to Hello Bistro before, but had heard good things about the burgers and salads. We ended up trying the place on a Saturday night, as our other plans for dinner were going to be over an hour wait. So we skipped the wait times at the other restaurants at McCandless Crossing and found ourselves here.   They were somewhat busy for 8pm on a weekend evening- nothing extreme. But it seemed like the \"to go\" orders were the ones that were taking the most time. There were a lot of people sitting around in the dining area who were waiting with slips for their to-go orders. The line moved fairly quickly - but the girl who was working the register was rude and just so painfully adolescent. She was annoyed by us ordering our meals because one of her friends was in the line behind us. She was smiling and waving around us, trying to not be agitated by having to take our order to talk to her friend. She was not paying attention because of this and we had to tell her three times that we needed two cups for two separate drinks. Ok, a little annoying, but I can get over it. She was huffy and rolling her eyes even though we probably had a 5 minute interaction with her.   We waited about 15-20 minutes for our orders to be ready for dining in. We went to find a table - which was a chore as every single table was DISGUSTING. They were covered in sticky soda, dried ketchup and trays of other people's garbage from their meals was just sitting around all over the place. It was really gross. Fiance ended up cleaning our table AND the drink/straws/ketchup stand because it was so foul.   When our food finally arrived the teenage boy who gave it to us said what my order was, then gave it to me. He then said \"and this other thing\" when handing fiance his meal. Uhm ok. Again, I can get over it and will try not to hold the service overall to these teenagers who were running the place on this night. This teenage boy also was in charge of cleaning the tables and drink station - which he walked by the garbage, spills and dirty tables repeatedly. When we left the place he still had not come out to wipe anything down or throw anything away.   I went for the \"over easy\" burger and fiance had the pot roast sandwich. Both were actualy pretty good. My burger was actually really well seasoned, tasted good, and was hot; though it was a pre-made patty, not a handmade one.  The homemade ranch they offer at the condiment stand was also AMAZING. If we could have dipped our hands into it, we would have. We also got orders of their fresh cut fries, which were good - but would have been 1000X better if they would not have been cold.   Overall, not a bad enough experience to deter me from here, but I think I would like to try it on a weekday to see if there is a difference in service.",

    "text": "I've been waiting for Hello Bistro to open ever since I took it upon myself to investigate what was actually going into this savanna of a shopping complex. Finally the hour is upon us and they are open!   I knew that it was owned by Eat'n Park so obviously it was a given that it would be a place with sure-good food (word to the wise: my usual go-to place for a simple meal when I'm hungry is Eat'n Park). But from what I heard, this place was supposed to be more like a Panera with table-side service, and it was! Your meal is brought to you after you order at the front desk and they give you a number to put on your table.   It's bigger inside that it looks on the outside. The decor is super trendy in regards to it being somewhat more modern with a fun flair; they have a chalkboard in the middle of the seating area where you can write whatever you want.   They specialize in salads, burgers, and grilled sam'iches. My two times being there already, I would recommend the apple & cheddar grilled cheese or the rockin' moroccan caesar salmon salad. Also try their handmade pumpkin milkshake to get in the fall season!  They offer takeout as well, which is ideal for ordering ahead of time before going home after work. Since it is owned by Eat'n Park, you can expect to order some of it's originals like a superburger, Eat'n Park coffee for $1, their classic soups (like chicken noodle, potato, and chili), and of course smiley cookies!   I give this place a four star rating because all-in-all it's a great, simple little cafe-like place to get a good meal or take something on the go. The place itself is visually appealing and the food is very tasty. If you're looking for something trendy and \"hip,\" then this isn't the place for you. But if you want a good meal and a good atmosphere, stop in and say Hello! ;)",

Their lime vinaigrette is to die for. The only light option is light French which I think they need to do better on. However, the salad was delicious as always. Next time I want to try a burger.

With the variety of toppings/additions to choose from, there's something here for even the pickiest of eaters. It does get fairly busy, so the quality of service isn't the best, but it's not bad enough that I wouldn't come back. I just wish they'd pay more attention to the takeout counter rather than constantly standing with their backs to it. All in all though, it's reasonably priced and very convenient to stop at for a lunch break.   My ONLY real complaint with the place is the ranch dispenser. For the love of god, Hello Bistro, either refill or replace the dispenser! Every time I've come in the handle has been all wonky and you have to try extremely hard to get ranch to come out. It feels empty, but there's also definitely something wrong with the pump. I've gotten ranch in my hair and on my clothing on multiple occasions while trying to get some out--yuck! It doesn't look very nice either.   Fix the dispenser and everything will be good in my eyes.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Saturday afternoon with my wife and her parents for lunch.  We have been driving by Hello Bistro for a number of weeks and had been thinking about trying it but had never managed to stop in before.  Whenever we arrived in the restaurant the first thing that I noticed was how busy it was.  As a matter of a fact there was no open seating available which didn't really bother us since we were getting our meal to go.  Hello Bistro is the type of place where you grab a menu and proceed to a counter before ordering.  If you are getting one of the items off the menu you are sent away with a number.  You are also given the option of building your own salad and can proceed through the line (ala subway or chipotle) telling the people what you want.  On this afternoon I wasn't feeling like eating too healthy and so for my lunch I went with the broccaflower grilled cheese and then added on a side of French fries.  My wife and her parents all ordered salads and we stood around off to the side while waiting.  After about a 15 minute wait our food was ready and we collected it and headed out.  I unfortunately didn't get to eat my meal immediately and instead it took around 20 minutes for me to get to it.  At that point the fries still were pretty hot while my grilled cheese was luke warm.  I really enjoyed the flavor of my grilled cheese and liked the healthy chunks of broccoli and cauliflower throughout.  The bread for it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked but I will chalk that up to the delay I had before I ate it.  I also really enjoyed the fries here as they were seasoned nicely and crispy.  They came inside their own brown bag which was covered in grease stains whenever it was handed over to me.  My wife and her parents really ended up enjoying their salads as well and thought that they had good flavors and were large.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here again in the future.  I would really like to try something else the next time, maybe a salad, but everything that our party had was good.",

I made it through the line quickly and was on my way in about 10 minutes.  It was soooo loud in there.  High ceilings and cement floors don't help..but it was packed - a good sign.

    "text": "I had kept seeing this place around town and finally decided to stop in before a movie to check it out. I was a bit surprised when I walked in seeing the salad bar. I wasn't expecting that. For some reason I was under the impression this was more of a burger place. There is nothing wrong with a salad bar at all. Just saying that I wasn't expecting it and as I was looking for a burger, that's what I went after. Once I figured out where to place my order, I had to ask the waitress for a menu because there is just a chalk board with specials written on it. She seemed a little annoyed that I would ask and was not very friendly. I ended up getting a special anyway.  I ordered the En'P Superburger Combo for $7.49. Now I know this sounds crazy but at the moment I placed my order everything fell into place...En'P Superburger...Smiley Face...this is a spinoff of Eat n' Park!!! How did I not realize this earlier?!  I've had a Superburger before and it was decent. The fries weren't bad either. It was nice that they had a ranch dispenser with the condiments. My food came out hot and fairly quick. But it wasn't really what I was expecting or hoping for. I thought this was going to be a something new and different that I hadn't seen before. So needless to say, the experience was somewhat deflated. I'm not going to judge on that though.  The food was average just as it is at Eat n' Park. The service wasn't the best and I felt like an annoyance to the waitress when I asked for a menu.  On the plus side, they have a Boylan's Soda Machine which was excellent. I tried both the ginger ale and birch beer and greatly enjoyed both.  I probably would not go back for a burger but wouldn't mind trying the create your own salad.  That's what I find ironic about my experience. I did not expect a salad place and wanted a burger. Got a burger and walked away wanting a salad.",

In the morning I couldn't locate my wallet, realized it was missing, and I cancelled my debit/credit cards.  I called HB before the store opened at 9:30am to see if it was there or if it was turned in.  Well, they found my wallet in the parking lot while they were putting out trash!

Each time I've been here (and I've been here numerous times), it's been an odd experience. Perhaps I'm just hitting them at tough times, but most of the time, the wait for a salad is pretty lengthy, it appears chaotic and there's food all over the floor.  Knowing this, I started ordering online for pick up. The first time I did this, I arrived at the time my order was to be ready and ended up waiting fifteen minutes for my salad to be prepared. The next time, the restaurant was \"temporarily closed\" (I'm not sure why). Today, I tried pre-ordering online again and when I showed up at 11:10 (for an 11:00 pick up), the restaurant was closed due to major water issues. I'm hoping I'm not charged for the salad that was never made, but I've heard nothing from the restaurant.  I totally understand that emergencies happen and days can be unpredictably busy or abnormal, but as a customer, I'm not sure how many more times I'll keep trying. Like I said, I REALLY want to love this place and continue to visit, but too many strange occurrences have me looking elsewhere for lunch. Is this a management issue? Not sure, but something's going on.",

First, the free birthday meal.  That's what got me here in the first place.  While it seems that most people (at least when I stopped in) order salads, I went with the Superburger Combo (burger, fries, drink).  I was impressed with the salad layout, but for my birthday if the choice is a burger or a salad?  Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'll always go for the burger.  Especially when it's an EnP classic.  While there were a few customers ahead of me, the wait wasn't long to place my order or receive it.  I ordered mine to go (online ordering is available, though I didn't go that route).  Service was what I expected (quick), so no complaints there.  When my order was handed to me, it was packaged like an old school diner might deliver it.  Burger was wrapped separately, hand-cut fries placed in a separate bag, all placed in a brown bag for transport.   Here's where Hello Bistro wins points: the dispenser of EnP ranch (complete with little cups and lids to go) and the Boylan soda fountain.  Two things I've never seen or expected but earned Hello Bistro high marks.  I didn't think the menu was all that exciting but now that I've seen what they have to offer, I'm fairly certain I'll be back.",

    "text": "We used to love coming to Hello Bistro in McCandless after we've done our shopping in the area. However, today was the FINAL time we will come to this Hello Bistro. For the THIRD time a burger that my daughter ordered was bloody inside. They don't ask you at the register how you want your burger cooked, but if they want to serve bloody burgers then they better start asking. My daughter showed an employee behind the counter, who stated \"oh my! that's definitely not cooked completely\" and she tossed it in the trash. When she asked the kid cooking to make another he was hollering (very unprofessional) for everyone, including us, to hear in the restaurant that the burger was cooked. No it wasn't and we also have photo's to prove it!  When I asked for a manager, the girl refunded our money and asked if my daughter wanted another. Well, duh...we stopped here for dinner so yes, a fully cooked, not still mooing burger would be swell.  I then caught, who might be the shift manager who, of course, apologized but was in a hurry to leave and said she would talk to the employee when she returned. Three strikes you're out! We will not be returning to this Hello Bistro again.   This review also doesn't refer to the multiple times we've been in and either the ranch is out of order or the ketchup is empty. Today we experienced with a mooing burger, the diet pepsi was out of order.  Someone needs to get this place in order or else people will start going to the Bistro up the road in Pine. That's where we'll be going from now on or just shop out in the South Hills and go to the Bistro in USC. We have never had an issue at either one of these locations.",

The concept is pretty straight-forward, and the prices are the main attraction.  Considering there are usually 15-20 people working, you'd think the system would be a little more seamless, but something is always out of sorts. Orders get mixed up on the line, ingredients are missing, and I've generally dealt with some unpleasant employees.  The burgers are hit or miss, but the fries are right up my alley. And for nostalgia-sake it's nice to get the grilled cheese with tomato soup every now and again, and throw in a milkshake for good luck.  For a cheap lunch that keeps the wife happy, I can't go wrong. I'll be back, but hopefully the concept as a whole continues to improve.",

With a huge assortment of fresh ingredients, fruits and vegetables and no weight limit to what you can add, Hello Bistro is a salad lover's paradise.   Their proteins are decent in the salad, but you're not trying to get the most delicious chicken or the best salmon by coming here. It's healthy, well done, but rather bland in my opinion. The chicken specifically tends to lack flavor. I would say the same for the other proteins. Otherwise, you have tons of choices for fruits, veggies, crunchy additions and dressings!  I wouldn't recommend their burgers or other sandwiches simply because they're pretty much average. The same goes for the fries. It's great if a member of your party wants something other than salad, but it won't be as good as the salad will be.",

    "text": "As a very particular person, \"build your own\" really floats my boat at restaurants. I recently obtained a job in the North Hills, and a coworker suggested Hello Bistro for their build your own salad on my lunch break. I was in HEAVEN when I saw all of the salad options. I was able to pick the type of lettuce I preferred AND add as many toppings as I wanted. They carried every topping imaginable! There was not a single topping that I wished they had. I also LOVED the way they tossed and cut the salad. I hate when you get a salad and all of the toppings stay on the top or float to the bottom... Hello Bistro solved that problem by chopping the contents of your salad according to your preference (small, medium, or large pieces). They even ask if you want light, regular, or extra dressing to toss as well... talk about customization!   The biggest turnoff for me was the wait time. The line was not the problem; however, the fact that you have to wait for the workers to make the online/mobiles orders before yours is CRAZY. My friend and I had to wait 20 minutes before the worker was ready to make our salad, which wasted our entire lunch break! There should definitely be someone whose job is solely to manage online orders while another manages the in-store customers. In addition, it was a little pricey. My salad was about $12. It was a nice sized salad, so I wasn't too upset over the cost.   Overall, I loved Hello Bistro. I just feel that there are some logistics the company needs to work out to please their customers and make the business run more smoothly. The level of customization available was above par, but I would definitely mobile order next time.",

I never would've guessed that a place known for its MTO salad game would have such a great burger but I've had the \"over easy\" burger twice now and I've gotta give major respect to their burger game.  Every aspect of this bacon cheeseburger + egg burger was tasty, given love, and had a distinct flavor, including an amazing bun.  (I know, rite?)  Y'know that episode where Squidward finally eats his first Crabby Patty and starts happy-floating around the joint? -it's like that.  HA!    The fact that they even bring it out to you means, with $10, I have a real (MUCH BETTER) alternative to just getting something at the drive thru.    Well done, HB (uh, \"medium-well\" actually... heh). ... And now, back to my tasty deliciousness...",

Served to me luke warm.  Decent price though for the Superburger combo, which included the fries and drink for 7.99.  Dining area wasn't the cleanest place either; didn't see anyone paying any attention to dirty tables, floors, etc.  To top it all off, cashier wouldn't accept my coupon after I inserted my charge card.  I would think in this technological era we live in there should be a way to accept a coupon that is presented a few seconds too late.  Next time I'll pay a little more and go to the burger place next door for better quality/experience.",

I visited for a Sunday lunch and was overwhelmed by their salad topping and dressing options. I opted to try their Jamaican shrimp salad coated in a lime vinaigrette and it was fabulous! There was a copious amount of shrimp and I loved that you have the option to get it fine chopped. It comes in perfectly bite sized pieces with a thorough mix and tossed in dressing. My boyfriend ordered a burger and raves about his meal, especially the fries.   They also offer online ordering for a to-go option which I love. The inside was clean and crisp and had a nice ambiance. I can't wait to go back and try more concoctions!",

    "text": "From my one experience this place is very poorly managed. There were 7-8 employees working for even less customers while I was there. Everyone was doing seemingly whatever they felt like in a hap hazard way. There was no overarching production process so quality and accuracy were non existent. I ordered a cobb salad meal, a greek salad and a caprese grilled cheese. The cobb salad was made two times by accident, when they figured it out it probably went to waste. The second cobb salad was made with the stem still on the half of an avocado; not a nice touch. While I was waiting for my order, someone came back into the store complaining their order was wrong. (Made sense). The customer gave them back the salad. For some strange reason that salad was placed on the table where the good orders go. Someone found it and didn't know who it belonged to and began asking around. Another customer asked for the napkins off of my table, Which I thought was strange considering 90% of the tables were not occupied. I then realized 90% of the napkin holders didn't have napkins. With 8 people working and less customers in house, I think someone could stock the napkins. My cobb salad was okay, the fries were decent, the greek salad was made with blue cheese instead of the described feta (really?). Our caprese grilled cheese had a large inedible basil stem.  The workers need to be taught discipline. Also too many flies buzzing around. I doubt I'll go back, I was already leery prior.",
