The buffet contained a large variety of food, including sushi, Chinese food, traditional American food, and desserts. Most items were clearly labeled, but some were not. As we finished each course, the server promptly removed the used dishes from the table. She was pleasant and attentive throughout our visit. The restaurant was clean and well maintained. We visited on Saturday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised to see that each of our meals cost less than $7.00!",

I love their dumplings and general Tso. Great for work and pay by the pound take out whatever can fit in a box lol. I love going here with the family low price and they have free for all on desserts and ice cream. If you expect being immobile the remainder of the day its one of those meals that creep up and have u feeling fuller by the hour lol. If u wanna avoid paying by the sushi roll they are great as well...even have a hibachi station where you can pick ur own raw food and he will cook it for you on the spot....the ambiance is the best it used to be up scale sushi and hibachi joint so it still looks super fancy just without the ridiculous high prices! Great place......if your looking for date type of service try elsewhere.",

There's a decent selection of Asian items to choose from, along with a small sushi section + a stir-fry station.  There are cold salad items & cut fruit, as well as desserts, including scooped ice cream.  A bottom-less soft drink costs about $1.00. The restaurant is nice enough looking & the staff is quick to clear dirty plates & re-fill drinks. And there's plenty of parking as this mall has a lot of vacant stores now.  Whatever happens at this mall, I hope TJs is able to survive.",

One nice thing was that they also offered sushi on the buffet which I have not seen at other Chinese buffets that I've been to.   Very clean. Seated and able to proceed to the buffet immediately. Service was very friendly. Reasonable prices.   The food was good but not fantastic. Wonton soup was bland, egg rolls had minimal filling, chicken and broccoli was good so was the salt and pepper chicken. The chocolate pudding had an odd flavor and was a little runny. Fried buns were good.  Husband enjoyed the sushi which was fresh.   Overall, I think this is your standard Chinese buffet with the bonus that they have sushi too. I would return if in the area and very hungry for Chinese. Otherwise, I wouldn't go out of my way because I didn't think it was anything special.",

The sushi was tasty and so was everything else in the buffet. I even had dessert. It's probably a staple for anyone in the Tarentum area. I wish they had more locations. The staff was friendly and the facility was packed because I suppose others enjoyed the food too.",

A few Cali rolls to choose from (not that I'd trust raw fish here) and none of it was done well.   I know it's cheap for lunch @$6.79 but still not worth it in my eyes.",

There's really not much service involved but the lady came around to clean up our plates and fill up our water regularly. It's very nice looking on the inside also. The only thing I would stay away from would be the fish. There were lots of sharp bones and one jabbed me pretty good.",

    "text": "We have visited this restaurant twice and both times the food has been fantastic.  We eat at a lot of Chinese buffets, and I know that the quality can change over time, but at the moment this buffet is on the same level as Hokaiddo's in my opinion -- which is to say excellent.  The number of dishes is a little less than other Chinese buffets --- but I also like this aspect  because eating too many different things can upset the stomach.  Fortune Star used to be our favorite but at some point the quality of food seems to have changed and we stopped going there.  The dishes I really enjoyed are the dumplings (very fresh and tasty), the hot and sour soup, the sushi bar (very beautifully designed sushi pieces that are very fresh), and I must say I love their french fries!  The french fries are thick cut potatoes that are crispy and not over-salted.  The only bad thing I can say is that the staff seems to be under a little pressure.  The hostess (and I assume manager or possibly owner) barks out orders like a general and the staff doesn't seem to smile very much but they are very attentive.  The price is only $10 which is really hard for me to believe.  I've eaten at other Chinese buffets that only charge $9 or $10 and the quality is usually poor but NOT here.  The quality is excellent!",

I never saw anyone there to cook although I saw a kid patiently hoping that someone would show up. The shrimp chips were bendable instead of crisp. I asked staff about this and was assured that the chips had been put out today. I eventually ascertained that they had been sitting out since lunch. There were no scoops in the ice cream so people were using their own spoons. This caused there to be mixing of the flavors of ice cream. The more expensive sushi was eaten quickly by other customers and was not replaced while we were there. The Chinese food at the steam tables was bland and greasy.",

However, the restaurant could be cleaner, found a dead fly in one of our glasses of water, also some of the plates they put out for the buffet had large droplets of water on them; water in a plate stack= bacteria. Some of the food tastes a little strange, in my opinion, but nothing completely out of the ordinary. I noticed the sweet and sour chicken had a weird blueberry taste in either the sauce or the batter for the chicken they used, also the beef they serve is of a real low quality. One thing I will tell you to absolutely not to get is one of their desserts that looks like a rice crispy treat, but instead of rice crispies, it's different types of nuts. It's rock hard and has almost no flavor, you'll nearly chip a tooth attempting to eat it.  TJ Buffet gets a lot of volume and I noticed they put all of the other Chinese food in the food court out of business so they must be doing something right. Either that or the Mills mall is dying as of late; It could honestly be both. If you're hungry and at the Mall or in the Pittsburgh Mills area I'd recommend stopping by. It might be the only buffet-style restaurant in a 30 mile radius and it's definitely worth giving them a try if you've never eaten there before.",

    "text": "I've written about the TJ Buffet in North hills a number of times; this was my first visit to the Pittsburgh Mills location. I won't mince words; it was only because the North Hills location closed. There was nothing \"wrong\" with my Sunday dinner here. And I gave it 3 stars which Yelp describes as meaning \"A-OK.\"  Yet I feel it might need a bit of explanation. Why not 4 or 5 stars? Let me say this is a quite reasonable place to have dinner. The price is reasonable, it's clean, the servers are competent, the food is good. You will get your money's worth. However I am left short a bit as to reasons why I'd want to go back. Pittsburgh Mills is a LONG drive for people from metro Pittsburgh. WAY out Route 28 well past the Turnpike. And it's in an empty mall, so there's not much any other reason to go there. Shopping? Please. There's like 3 stores operating out of a million or so square feet of shopping space. The selection on the buffet isn't as extensive as TJ Buffet North Hills had, nor other alternatives such as Hokkaido buffet. There were a few types of sushi, \"hibachi\" to order, a selection of hot, cold and dessert foods, but not much unusual. Hot crayfish, some heavily breaded crab pieces, and some short Chinese style rib pieces were the only \"premium\" buffet items. Bottom line: Way better than spending $10 on fast food, but I'm sad that TJ North Hills, and its Japanese predecessor, and Misaki are all gone. Pittsburgh has a vacuum waiting to be filled by a better quality Asian/Sushi buffet.",
