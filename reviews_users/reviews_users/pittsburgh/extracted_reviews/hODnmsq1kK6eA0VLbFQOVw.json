    "text": "While visiting the area, we stopped here for what turned out to be a disappointing visit.    Despite seeing hit and miss yelp reviews, we visited as it was close to our hotel.  First off, parking is an issue at this restaurant.  We had to circle the restaurant several times and wound up waiting for a spot to open up, which it eventually did.    Upon entering the restaurant, we were \"greeted\" by a older hostess whose only greeting was an expressionless \"How many?\".  Upon getting her answer, she turned and started to walk away.  Should we follow her? Is she checking on what tables are available?  Well, she had menus in her hand, so we followed.  She deposited the menus on a table and walked away.  Not an auspicious start.  Our waiter was friendly and attentive however.  The bread that was served was warm, fresh, and quick.  My wife's salad start was good.  My lobster bisque however did not taste fresh and was a thicker than I've had in other places.  Not terrible, just not something that I would order again.    On to the main courses: My wife also enjoyed her Lasagna dish.  Unfortunately, my Veal Parmigiana was horrible.  There was something off with the veal that I can best describe as really stale breading on old meat.  My wife was not happy with me for the taste testing sanity check I inflicted on her.  I returned the entree after two bites.    To her credit, the restaurant manager came over and did all the right things.  She showed genuine concern in understanding what was wrong with the meal.  The item was taken off the bill, an offer to make something different was made, and a coupon to be used on a future visit was provided.  Bravo to her!  Unfortunately, our waiter must have been offended that we returned something as the previously attentive service grew decidedly frosty.    To summarize, our experience mirrors the reviews that you'll find on this restaurant.  Some folks love it, some pan it.  Our hit and miss experience during our visit backs this up.",

    "text": "My wife and I own and operate a business together. Our business relies heavily on uniform customer service. I've had customers walk in late, it's not fun. How you assess and treat them makes the difference between a positive review and a poor one. So when my wife and I stopped in an hour before close at Bravo Cucina Italiana, I expected sparse clientele, but expected good food and service none the less.We work long hours and barely get to celebrate the fruits of our accomplishments, but on the evening of our eighth anniversary, I'd hoped only for a quiet meal and not to be rushed. The hostess' demeanor was a perfect match for her dark, disheveled hair and makeup. She made it plain that she was not happy to have our patronage at that time. Her attitude and sour glances at check in and throughout dinner were enough to ruin any hope of a bit of peace at the end of our day. The shining jewel of the service was Tori our waitress. She held the balance between pressure from management and her obligation to treat us well, impeccably. I had a phenomenal gluten free pasta dish and my wife had her usual. Tori; thanks for the great service. The rest of you... so sorry to bother you at an inconvenient time.  Josh",

Good service. Clean. Good atmosphere.  Had lunch here today and had the chicken, spinach and bacon flatbread. Yum! Moist chicken and well baked.  Tasted as if they put their spinach dip on flatbread.  Outstandingly good stuff.  Had the fresh bread and sun dried tomato oil.  I could eat just that and I would be satisfied most of the time.

Chef Boyardee is better than the stuff that they try to pass off as \"Italian\". The service was really not great either-- the waitress was super sarcastic to the point of it being laughable, especially because she looked like a homeless person. Between that, and the cheesy plastic pillars and bad rococo art, you could not pay me to go back to this place.   I find it hard to believe that anyone in Pittsburgh would eat at a Bravo, especially because of the mecca of amazing Italian restaurants here. It is a sub-par chain that gives fine cuisine a bad name. Go to Bloomfield instead for a much more authentic experience!",

The food was \"average\" at best, service was a bit less than average and the table we were placed at was unstable and we all had to be very careful while cutting food or resting our arms on the table.

When we were leaving, we mentioned to the server that there was a major problem with the table and he said, Yes, it's been like that for a long time. Everyone has problems. Well my feeling is....fix the problem so that people can have an enjoyable dining experience at your restaurant. Our food was decent but it was not terrific.",

It's highly overpriced for the \"Italian\" cuisine they serve, yet, there always seems to be a two hour wait on the weekends. Every time I have eaten there, I always left with a light wallet and a mediocre taste in my mouth. I know I don't need to eat there, but I am a strong believer in second chances.

    "text": "This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had. If you like Bravo and don't want to deal with the hassle, go to the Robinson location one.  My fiancee and I arrived at 5:50pm and were quoted a 60-70 minute wait. Long time, but no problem. So an hour and 10 minutes go by. We noticed a couple of young high-schoolers walk in, hugging the hosts and talking to them. Then, five minutes later, were seated. They were not given a buzzer like everyone else. This happened a few different times while we waited. So, after waiting slightly AFTER our initial time, my fiancee asked the hosts how much longer it would be- \"just a few more minutes, lots of tables are opening up.\" We waited for another twenty minutes, while people who had been there after us continued to get seated. Finally, an hour and a half after we had been waiting another lady who was waiting for a seat gave us HER buzzer because she found a seat at the bar. So, the only reason we were actually seated 30 minutes AFTER our quoted time was because someone else gave us their buzzer. When we walked up to the host stand with the buzzer, they looked at us, rolled their eyes, and waited another two minutes to get menus and seat us.   So then we were seated and we told the waiter our ordeal, because he had asked us how long we were waiting. We weren't going to hold it against him, it wasn't his fault. However, when we asked him for cherry coke, he just told us they had coke, without offering to put grenadine in it for us...I know the bar carries grenadine, however he clearly didn't want to make an effort to put any in for us.   So then we get our bread, without plates. Our waiter said \"Wow, it's like eating at an Ethiopian restaurant where you have to eat from a communal bowl.\" Then he walked away. Seriously, I cannot make this stuff up.   After using a small drink napkin as a makeshift plate, our house salads came. One of them came with dressing on the side, rather than already mixed into the salad per usual, which is not what we ordered. He said, \"Oh, I don't know why this is different, guess you'll just have to put it on the salad yourself.\" Again, this is for real people.  Alas, the manager came over and said, \"Sorry to interrupt you, I'm not going to lie, our kitchen screwed up your order. The chef asked me to come over and tell you that they have to remake the food and that he was sorry. So, sorry it is taking so long for your food, we screwed it up, but it's being fixed and should be out here soon.\" He didn't seem sincere, he acted like it was a joke to him. Silly us thought that he might have been aware of our previous inconveniences and had come over to apologize. We were so dumbfounded by his clear lack of awareness that we didn't think he had the mental capacity to understand  anything else if we were to explain it to him. He walked away and we decided to observe him. He is clearly the type of manager that is more interested in being the \"cool manager\" and goofing off, laughing with the hosts, than walking around and checking on the guests.  We eventually got our food, two basic pasta dishes, and left after five minutes from receiving our food. We were so exhausted from the whole ordeal that  we decided that it wasn't worth being at this poorly run restaurant any longer.  After giving us our bill, our server said \"thanks for being patient, please come back again.\" Honestly? Because you were so accommodating? No thanks. We actually had a bet going as to whether or not the hosts would stop talking to one another for five seconds and leaning sloppily on the host stand to say \"have a good night\" as we left, but alas my fiancee won the bet - they didn't say a word. We left, noticing that the time now was 8:30 pm.  Throughout the whole night, the chef won best customer service for us because he at least recognized he screwed up...and he doesn't even work directly with guests obviously!  This is seriously the Bravo from hell.",

Thankfully Bravo! offers better ambiance and savory fare several steps above your neighborhood Applebee's. I had the Petit Fillet with Jumbo Shrimp and was happy with my choice. If you're in the Ponderosa/Sizzler state of mind, this isn't the place for you. If you want something nicer (and a wee bit pricier), Bravo! is where you want to go. Good for families/groups of 6+ as well. They're sprinkled throughout Steeler country, so find one near you.",

    "text": "I know it's a chain and perhaps this is almost the equivalent of writing a review of olive garden, but I have to admit after eating here a few times recently and feel the need to share my appreciation of this place. I'm really pleased with this small chain.  First, you should have the right expectations it's not Alla Famiglia (which I love), nor is it Alla Famiglia prices...  It's located conveniently right off of  Mcknight road in the chain food wonderland that is the North Hills.  That's another reason to share this review.  If you find yourself faced with the other wonderful chain dining options such as applebees, tgif, bob evans, chilis and the like you should give this place a try.  The restaurant itself is large and airy with very high ceilings and a large bar.  The kitchen is open and the staff is super friendly and professional.  There is plenty of outdoor seating.  Most recently I was here during the week for lunch and was dining with my sis', Heather...Mom and gf, Annie.  I arrived first and we were having a relatively early lunch due to an early afternoon meeting.  Our server was an adult who clearly did this as a profession and not just as a way to make a few bucks till college was over.   Annie arrived next then Mom and Sis' in short order.   The bread arrived and was served warm and fresh.  The olive oil mixture was okay and the server was happy to comply with Mom's request for butter.  I ordered the Hickory Wood Grilled salmon and started with the wedding soup.  THe wedding soup was very flavorful and served correctly piping hot with large meatballs inside.  The waitress complied with my request for the lemon caper butter sauce on the side and served me a perfectly cooked portion of salmon sprinkled with bread crumbs, very crispy potatoes and fresh green beans.  I do appreciate that much of what I'm eating is shipped in from elsewhere and I don't have a classically trained chef preparing it,  but I've paid 3x as much for meals that weren' t 1/2 as good.  Mom had the lasagne bolognese which was a huge portion of better than average lasagna with both a red and white sauce, easily enough for two or three meals for $10, Sis' had the frittata (italian omelette) and soup which she said was very good.  Annie had the margharita pizza which was pretty good pizza with a tangy sauce, crisp crust and sparse amount of cheese.  We were able to all enjoy a good meal with very friendly professional service and it cost me less than $60 for all four of us.  As chains go this is a good one and obviously, we yinzers appreciate it because of the six locations in the state of Pennsylvania, five are in the burgh'.",

Caprese salad was more of a balsamic vin tossed salad w tomatoes and mozz instead of your classic caprese. Mozz also wasn't the freshest. For an entree I had the chicken scallopini which was actually pretty tasty. Chicken was very fresh and the sauce was quite nice, alittle heavy though.   Overall my biggest complaint would be the price of our meal , for the price you pay on an entree it should come with a side and a larger portion. The atmosphere and decor was nice but my girlfriend and I felt the tablecloths were unnecessary in this casual \"olive gardensque\" restaurant and to top it off they were pre-stained with tomato sauce when we sat down.  A decent restaurant I would eat at if there was nothing else nearby of the same stature, but I would not go out of my way to make reservations in the future.",

But, let's begin: We were sat in a corner, waited 10 minutes ( I timed it) before our server even greeted us, then placed our order (they were out of what I wanted of course.) She brought us some bread and dipping sauce, which was the only good thing we had, and our drinks. We got our salads and she walked away, we had no silverware which was really cool.  After I had to find her to ask for it, we proceeded to eat the salad which has no dressing. Our sever, of course, was nowhere to be found so we flagged down another one who then had to \"ring in\" dressing. I mean seriously??! You couldn't just go and get a cup of dressing?!?! So we wait a few minutes for dressing... And then I had the entire core of the lettuce in my salad, a salad which was disgusting.  On to the \"amazing\" entrees, my mom's lasagna was burnt to a crisp and my \"grilled\" chicken pesto spaghettini was water logged and tasted like bland nothingness.   I'm now out of a drink and our server is still missing. When she finally makes an appearance, she sees my empty glass and asks me if I want more. (Sever 101: you don't ask, you just bring a fresh one or the pitcher. I know, I worked in a restaurant.) That took a good 5 minutes and she brings back a pitcher that had maybe 3-4 small sips of water in it. She finally asks how the food was and I said fine because I didn't even want to deal with it, but my mom said something. So the manager comes over.... It was seriously a fiasco. I will never ever go back. All in all the food sucked, the service was worse, and top it off their mints tasted like citrus mint bubblegum flavored chocolate. FOUL is an understatement. And now I'm just #HANGRY",

    "text": "Went out this evening with my BFF for some shopping and a meal. We had planned on The Cheesecake Factory, but when we called for a wait time, we were told 80 minutes with no call ahead seating. We decided to call Bravo! Since both of us had only been there once years before. We were told a wait time of 30 minutes and took my phone number to put us in the \"wait line\".   We got there about 15 minutes after making our reservation and the place was PACKED! Big groups were coming in at 6:30 and were being told 1 hour wait times. I was so grateful that I called ahead!    When we were seated (within the 30 minutes), our waiter Austin came by for our drink order almost IMMEDIATELY! He was fun and personable. He bent over bacward to be quick and attentive even though it was a packed house.    I got the Caprese salad, wich was DIVINE! The balsamic vinaigrette here is the perfect blend of sweet and tart. I also ordered the Pasta Diavlo with chicken that I could barely eat after indulging in the salad and Delicious bread and seasoned oil! My friend had the Pasta Woozie (a take on Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo). She said the pasta was cooked perfectly and the alfredo sauce had a perfect blend of cream, cheese, and garlic! Her only complaint was she only found 2 pieces of chicken.    All in all it was a FANTASTIC visit and a wonderful night. We will definitely be back, and next time eat at the bar to see Austin who was the best waiter I have had in a LONG TIME!",

    "text": "I was meeting a customer for dinner one night and she chose Bravo... so what could I do?  Say no.  Unfortunately not.    My experience was an interesting one here to say the least.  I have to say considering that I got there around 5pm, I was shocked at how many ladies were already at the bar quite intoxicated.  I had just got off work and did not want to go home since I was meeting the customer around 5:45 so I figured I would grab a glass of wine and wait.    Well, this wait certainly turned out to be me being entertained by this group of three drunk women who the bartender said had been sitting their boozing it up since 3pm.  Apparently with each drink, their desire to one up one another became more and more apparent to those of us sitting there.  I feel bad for these women... to feel the need to talk so loudly about how much money they are spending on an outfit, how they won't buy anything but certain brands... it was laughable and pathetic and disturbing that that is what their lives were about.  Flirting with the bartender, they also made inappropriate comments (he had one of those finger cup things since he got cut and did not want it exposed) which I have to say made me want to get a table ASAP.  I was not going to subject my customer to them with their comments.  I am pretty laid back but it was just downright inappropriate.  I had had enough at this point.  Paid for my wine and was taken to a table to wait.   I will say my server was great, the eggplant parm was yummy and the bread was good.  It was everything that I was subject to prior that was what ruined everything.  Someone should have cut the women off or asked them to tone it down (it was not my place to).  I am just glad that I did not have to subject my customer to it!",

    "text": "I received a gift card for Christmas to Bravo. It's always fun to eat for free, right?  I have been to Bravo's before, but it's been a while. I remember them being a little \"classy\" on the inside. And I was right. The Bravo on McKnight is very classy looking. A very Italian like theme for restaurants. Love the broken looking pillars and beams. But, the bar area compared to other Bravo's I have been to was pretty small. Would have liked to see some high top tables in there and happy hour specials. That's always a win for the \"high priced chains\".  The service...  The service, although a bit slow, was overall pretty good. Our server had a bit of help with food runners and doggy baggers. That's got to be the technical term for that guys job!   Onto the food...  The Spinach Artichoke dip was like eating a crunchy piece of cardboard dipped into watered down spinach. I wasn't a fan of that at all. Their apps were definitely their weak point. The bread and oil had a flavor that I loved. Should have stuck to break and skipped the app. Meals were delicious. I had a veggie pasta, add chicken. My date had Lobster ravioli. I was quite unimpressed with the size of his dish. We are talking 1/3 the portion for his meal that was more expensive than mine. Dessert was delish. We got the cheesecake. Normally I am not a fan of cheesecake. This had a caramelized top with some sort of sauce and a strawberry. Overall, decent, but probably a bit overpriced for what it is. If it weren't for the gift card, I'd probably go for more local, but that's just my preference I guess.",

The Della Casa salad is great as an entree with the wedding soup, or as a side salad to the Chicken Parmesan. Yesterday's meal seemed a little slow to reach the table when the manager came to apologize for the delay. She had seen my meal that was about to be delivered and didn't think the pasta looked up to their standard presentation. It took a few minutes longer, but I received a deliciously prepared and presented meal! Then she offered a free dessert to eat there or take home to make up for the delay! She went the extra distance, without my asking, and impressed us at the table. Thank you! Much appreciated.",

We would usually sit at the kitchen counter and take our time eating, usually 3 courses and a few other drinks in between. We hated to eat slow and take up a table. We also tip very well since we are there for a while. We arrived on Sun night and sat at the counter with our wine. We ordered drinks and then the manager came up and said that no bottles were allowed anymore. I asked if we could have the bottle we brought in and were told no. I can understand the new policy, even thought I will not go there anymore, but by not allowing us to have the bottle we brought in one last time was insulting. We left carrying our bottle like we did something wrong and we will not return. Very poor way of handling the situation. Many other good Italian restaurants to frequent.",

But last night (Thurs) a friend and I went for happy hour. We sat at the high top table in the bar area. There was another table of four next to us.   No one approached our table for at least 15 minutes. The folks at the other table were looking around trying to catch the attention of the waiter. They wanted a drink refill.  I don't know what this waiter's problem was, but he was certainly not \"waiting\" on anyone. Eventually he did come and plop down the menus..took our drink orders,,,never asked if I wanted anything in my martini...I could go on and on.   And my food was awful. Ordered the scallops marinara. The scallops were the smallest I have ever seen even for bay scallops. It was very spicy as well.   The only redeeming event was that the GM came over to ask about our experience. Once I complained, he went right over to talk to the waiter. I wish I could say that this helped. It didn't.",

It took our waiter 20 minutes to bring us stale bread that was clearly old.  I couldn't even cut through it with a knife. The waiter apologized and all, but the \"fresh\" bread wasn't that much better.  Then, my mom and I waited another 20 minutes for entrees which were salty and greasy.   We ordered the Chicken Milenese and Pepperoni & Meatball Manicotti.  The manicotti was ridiculously greasy - drowning in oil, ugh.  On top of it all, the filling was mad mushy.  My mom's chicken was straight up gross.  The oil had this nasty smell to it - I don't really know how to describe it.  They probably used old oil that's been sitting there, double ugh.  Plus, the chicken tasted super gamey.  The only thing edible on her dish was the herb linguine which was mediocre at best.    Bah, super disappointed.  If you're in the mood for Italian, I suggest driving the extra distance and goin' to the Cranberry location.",

I've come to bravo in the past but never paid much attention to the point of writing a review.   First off I was craving Olive Garden mostly for the soup salad and breadsticks but caved for Bravo because it was closer to my house. I ordered the pasta woozie which is what I usually get, chicken fettucine Alfredo with spinach. The waiter asked me what type of salad I wanted with my meal, this threw me off because I automatically assumed it came with a salad. Nope. You need to pay at least 5.99 extra for a salad. Strike 1. The meal does come with some pretty good bread and oil but when you're craving olive garden breadsticks there is nothing else that will fill that void.  Service was prompt and everyone was kind and attentive.   I hate comparing restaurants but I feel that bravo is just a watered down wanna be olive garden that falls short. I wish I would have driven the extra 2 miles for that unlimited salad and breadsticks with my fake italian meal. Oh well!",

When we visit Pittsburgh we like to dine at Bravo because the food is good but next time we will not be back because of the crappy service.    First of all my fiancee was told it would be a 45min wait  I use opentable for everything ( when it's available ) so we actually already had reservations but the lady was not listening to us and couldn't find our name in the system.  After the manager overheard her she looked & said Caitlyn the reservation is right here and I'll seat them right away. She gave us the biggest eye roll ever  ! So rude  We're seated right away by Sara who's apologized at least 5 x already and really it's ok thank you for making it right.  She brings 2 teas 1 lemonade and my vino, the teas were good nice and dark the lemonade was fresh, I guess the accidentally poured 2 glasses so I got 1 free I'm ok with that   Now Alex comes over I think he's the manager and he said he overhead the hostess being rude and apologized so he offered us any appetizer of our choice for free.  Very kind of him   We picked the chicken, bacon, spinach & cheese flat bread.  Omg am I glad we did because it was Delish  Nice and crunchy corners soft middle, bacon cooked to perfection  enough to feed 3 men and a little lady.    My Entree: very good fresh Brussel sprout & almond salad with a lemon vinaigrette.  Super fresh greens with tender chicken added   Italian wedding soup: it could have been warmer since it was freezing outside, carrots, little meatballs orzo and a yummy broth was all swimming around in my cute little soup bowl.  I can't complain to much it was yummy   The Bravo Spaghetti that was brought out to my brother in law looked very good, thin noodles a medium amount of meat sauce he said it was tasty a solid 7 !  My man had the Bolognese, again very tasty, nice portion size, the noodles cooked to perfection. A solid 9!   My son had the chicken Caesar salad he loved it nice fresh chicken and lettuce was fresh   So the food was great but the service sucked in the beginning,  however the management teamed up and took great care of us ! So Bravo to the management at Bravo  you did a great job but we might just visit a different location next time we're in Pittsburgh",

    "text": "Pretty much what you would expect from a large chain \"Italian\" restaurant.  Mostly \"americanized\" takes on Italian dishes (remember there is no alfredo sauce in Italy).  Started out with an order of the fried calamari.  Not very tender, and most likely frozen and not fresh/chef prepared.  Ordered the house salad to go along with the entree.  It was a chopped salad with tomato, bacon, cucumber in a house dressing of creamy Parmesan.  If you are looking for any health benefits in a salad, don't order this one.  You could barely see any lettuce through the heavy cream dressing.  And any lettuce that was there was iceberg, which was mostly white in color and covered up by the dressing.  I should have snapped a picture to better describe it.  Not very good at all.  Maybe it would be better with just oil & vinegar instead of the heavy house dressing.  Main course was from the new Imbriolo family recipe menu.  These consist of 4 spaghetti dishes.  They are all reasonably priced although once again not very authentic (Cacio e pepe would never have butter in it in Italy).  I ordered the spaghetti pomodoro and it was fairly tasty and as I said previously it was reasonably priced.  Drinks were also pretty reasonable.    House wine and cocktails both $7 and under.  Service was very good and attentive.  So overall, I would give it a 4 star for service & pricing and a 2 star for food quality & menu selections/choices, thus averaging into a 3 star overall.  I haven't been to Bravo in years.  It used to always be packed.  I realize this was a weeknight but it wasn't very crowded at all.  Seems like chains in this mode might be experiencing problems (Chil's, TGIF, Applebees, etc).  The menu has been slimmed down since the last time I visited and the new Imbriolo dishes are kind of underwhelming.  Still a decent value but probably not someplace I would seek out again as a destination for a special event or anything like that.",

The menu is Italian and limited, with a few simple meat and pasta choices, a couple of soup and salad offerings, and a limited but adequate wine list. Prices are kind of mid-level and service is usually prompt. The food is unremarkable, but up to the unchallenging standards of a corporate restaurant. Overall it's a safe choice if you're looking for basic, but not quite authentic, Italian food. With no authentic Italian competition in the suburbs, Bravo fills the void. I guess you could call that faint praise, but so what, at Bravo there is also little to criticize.",

    "text": "Went here about a week ago. I decided to get take out and ordered a chicken parm with a side salad and spaghetti. When I called in the order they told me about 40 minutes minimum. I went around and did some errands and then came back about 20-25 minutes after ordering. I went in and the lady behind the counter was nice and was friendly. The system for take out is not good at all. I walked in and the lady behind the counter had to get another person then that person came out and took my credit card. They took credit card and disappeared into back and then came out with food and receipt. The process from the time I walked in to the time I walked out was at least 10 minutes. The food was already ready when I came in so it sat there getting cold while they where getting the payment thru. They told me at least 40 minutes it was less than 25 if I would of come at the 40 minute mark it would of sat for 15 minutes getting ice cold and then the 10 minute ride home as well. Now for the food, I have too say the only good part of the meal was the salad. The chicken part was not good and I did not like the taste of it also it was ice cold besides. The spaghetti was cold and the sauce was not that good as well. I do not think I would ever go there for take out again as the system for take out needs a lot to be desired as well as they do not know how to estimate food prep time. I also noticed many negative reviews so I probably would not go back ever again. I do not recommend Bravo for take out at all.",

The simple pleasures of dining there are beyond great. I was always a fan of the simple and delectable oil and bread appetizer (which is complimentary) I recommend the salmon and vegetable entree' The salmon is obviously freshly made because it never had any sort of fishy taste (like some other salmon offerings at other restaurants) At Bravo!, It really is a great menu option. The prices are a bit high, so I wouldn't expect a bill under thirty dollars for one person. It's definitely worth it though for special occasions. For dessert, if you aren't full, they have Crem bru le! and cheesecake that outcompetes the Cheesecake Factory. The wait staff is also friendly.",

For starters, don't serve burnt, hard to chew bread. I'd rather wait five more minutes for a fresh loaf than be served ends of the unwanted bread. Next, the food was so underwhelming. I'm a novice foodie at best, but I honestly felt I couldn't have made a worse presentation. Lastly, why are chefs so loud? A constant \"WHOOP\" kept coming from the kitchen. If you're in a five star establishment and that's your signature - fine. But it's McKnight, and it's Bravo. Silence yourself. Diners, don't expect much!",

I ordered the Spicy bay scallop marinara entree. The scallops were tender and delicious, the sauce was a nice spicy tomato sauce but definitely not too spicy. Someone at the table let the staff know it was my birthday so they brought me a vanilla creme brule. They must have just taken it out of the cooler because it was cold in the center.

First off, when I went to use the restroom before eating, it smelled like a carnival outhouse. Completely disgusting. There was urine on the floor. If I hadn't been so starving at the time, I would have walked out. We asked for bread (during previous visits, it was brought out after beverages) and the waitress said, \"oh you want it now?\" Which rubbed me the wrong way. I ordered the Chicken Scallopini and asked for her to leave the Chicken off of it because i don't eat meat. She made a confused face and asked me if I wanted something instead, but I didn't know what options I had, so I just asked her to add extra mushrooms to it. When I got my dish, it looked... sad. There were two whole portobellas laying beside some twirled pasta. The portion seemed small compared to my friend's spaghetti. As I cut into the mushrooms, I saw that they were scalloped horizontally, almost paper thin. I have never in my life seem a mushroom cut that way. I had many bites that were just stem. The mushrooms were also extremely undercooked. It was hard enough to find something to eat because they don't have vegetarian options other than salad and eggplant parm. (I don't like eggplant). I didn't return the dish because I couldn't bare to be there anymore. I will never go here again. This place has awful service, dated recipes, high prices, and paper on their tables, on top of the table cloth. (Thought that seemed trashy).",

Once we told them about the bill they did fix it and gave use it to go. Overall it wasnt what I was expecting. Typically it is very good guess they had a off night",

Tom was the bartender who was personable, knowledgeable, attentive and overall just really gave us a feeling of being welcomed. I think how a service person makes you feel is very important and he made us feel like we were his best guests coming in for their big night out on the town. Food was sup yummy, I had the Shrimp Diavlo which I had GLUTEN FREE, the noodles were perfect and i enjoyed the dish like any non glutard. My boyfriend had the pizza which he said was one of the best pizzas he had. Luckily we both had enough to take home for left overs. The ambiance was warm and welcoming which I really appreciated. Never once did Tom act like we were a chore he was very excited to talk to us about wines offered by the glass along with different entrees. It's so nice to go to a chain like this and be treated so nicely. I have nothing but nice things to say about Bravo after this experience and the previous one I had a few months ago. Keep it up guys, you got a good thing going. Thank you everyone, compared to the \"higher end\" restaurants of Pittsburgh.. you guys got it going on thank you again SO much.",

The second time, the menu options and food quality went downhill- They didn't offer the lamb chops or polenta anymore, I even had reservations but was seated in a tight corner. I ordered a shrimp pasta and it wasn't anything to write home about. I don't quite understand why this restaurant gets so crowded when it's just run of the mill Italian food that you can get anywhere.",
