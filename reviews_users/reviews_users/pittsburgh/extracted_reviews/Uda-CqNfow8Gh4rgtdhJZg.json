I would definitely order again if I was only in the mood for wings.",

The chicken Caesar wrap wasn't that good either. The wrap itself was stale, and overall it was a sloppy runny mess. Everything was cold, and was generally on par with something cooked in the microwave 30 mins before it got to my door. Oh and let's not forget no cucumber sauce or marinara (or other dipping sauce for that matter) to dip the poppers and fried mushrooms in. Maybe this was an isolated incident, but with not a single redeeming thing about the entire order, I feel I cannot trust this place go try them again....",

The pizza sauce was barely there and had almost no flavor. They toppings used were as cheap as you could possibly get. I have never had a pizza the taste is so much like nothing. They also did not honor my request for no olives.  Disappointed, I decided to try the wings. When I open the box the wings were sitting in a third of an inch of oil. They were over saturated in oil and unpalatable.  I was excited to try a new place that had good reviews. I was shocked with how bad the food was. I will not be going there again.",

That said.... the food and prices are so good I couldn't even get mad enough to discontinue business.  The food is absolutely delicious! I love, love, LOVE their pizza. It's got some kind of spice going on that makes it different from every other pizza joint in Pittsburgh and keeps me coming back. The wings are pretty generous, the Cesar chicken wrap is delicious, and the hoagies never disappoint. But the French fries? They're the best. Greasey with real cheese, not cheese sauce, on top.

I will most definitely be ordering again & recommending this place.",

We usually get the White Pizza, hot pepper cheese balls, and another app (varies).  I think the White Pizza is amazing!  The flavors you get when biting into the first slice are out of this world!  I would take this pizza over any other any day.    I normally order on Yelp because it's easier.  Our first time ordering on Yelp took a very very long time.  I had to reach out to Yelp after an hour to figure out where our food was and the owner called me and apologized and our food showed up shortly after.  No real issues but they're not far from us so I didn't expect it to take as long as it did.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for something different to try.  I say get one of the gourmet pizzas because you can get a cheese & pepperoni pizza anywhere.  Great little find for us!",

We went for the chicken and spinach which also came with thinly sliced tomatoes and bacon. We also subbed white sauce since it seemed more apt for these toppings...  Great choice! Toppings weren't very heavy handed but we still found the flavors spot on. In regards to service, we found the staff to be very friendly when we walked in. When we asked for a few plates, the lady behind the counter neatly bagged us a few heavy duty plates and napkins. I actually only expected a few paper plates to be handed to me.  The only thing that could have been better was if the crust was just a bit more crisp.",

The wings are probably the best I've had of their type. They are pretty heavily breaded and fried (some like naked wings- these are not them!) and we got bourbon flavor and it was awesome.  The salads are always fresh with a good amount of toppings and dressing. I like the popcorn chicken salad.  My only reason for four stars and not five is the pizza. It's just not my favorite and for whatever reason seems to be undercooked. I like a doughy pizza, but this takes squishy to a new level. It TASTES okay, so if I order more I'd just ask for it to be well done.  The manager (owner maybe?) has delivered to our house on occasion, and he is the sweetest man with the best customer service. Glad a place like this delivers to my area!!",

Our zucchini planks and cheese balls arrived super crisp and hot just like if would have been dining in. Big thumbs up for figuring that out!",

The meat pizza is as you would expect, a carnivore's dream.  The taco pizza is topped with taco meat, cheddar cheese, followed by crushed tortilla chips, fresh  lettuce, and tomato.   The chips provide a texture change which I really like.  Small Pizza base price is under $10 so you can get a really good pizza at a great price.  Delivery is fast if you are in the area.",

That being said, this pizza had an excellent sauce with a subtle spice to it that really made it stand out. If I was ordering for a large group I'd go with this pizza place because I'm sure that it would please everyone.   Also got a wedgie, that uniquely Pittsburgh mix between a calzone and a hoagie, and it was delicious. Definitely one of the better wedgies I've ever had.  Lastly, the delivery man was exceptionally nice. I didn't believe it from the reviews (after all, how can all of these people be getting the same GrubHub/Yelp guy) but Tomatoes II sends their own delivery person out for those orders as well, and he really is the kindest delivery person ever.",
