I've had better Chinese fare and noodles at other places. They do have a Cuban menu if people are interested in that, although I can't really comment on how good the fare from that menu is.",

One thing that sucks is that a lot of food is wasted because they bring out pre-set foods to your table. They also serve Cuban food in the front if you're looking to spice up the variety.",

    "text": "I was about to get a free swipe into market when a friend called me and told me that they needed a third person to eat all you can eat hot pot.  All you can eat hot pot.  For $20 a person, with a minimum of three people at a table, you can have all you can eat hot pot (on the weekdays--I was told that it's $30 on weekends. Also you can eat 2 people at a table, but you'll be charged for the 3-person price.... I was told by my friends). We ordered a split of half spicy and half plain broth. They set up the single gas burner and came bearing a giant tray (at least 3 feet across), stacked with dishes for us to cook. (Which is how hot pot should work--eaters cook it themselves).   Among the dishes stacked on top of each other were: sliced beef, sliced lamb, tilapia fillets, shrimp with heads, napa cabbage, bok choy, tripe, 3 different kinds of fish balls, beef meatballs, fried tofu, bean thread, spam, cellophane noodles, mushroom sprouts, daikon, lotus root, and fake crab. All those were AYCE, except for the 10 shrimp.  Especially the lotus root, the ingredients were so uncommon it was a pleasant surprise that they served it. Also the beef and lamb were too fatty for me, but I liked the fish (which was probably frozen). All the vegetables looked and tasted fresh.  The spicy broth was delicious and not too spicy. On the side of the room, there was a small table with 5 different colorful sauces for customers to self serve. I liked the garlic oil sauce.   There were many waitresses, and around us were larger crowds of 12 people at each round table.  We were there for 2 hours. I'd come back again.",

    "text": "Unquestionably the best Chinese food in Pittsburgh, and the best Chinese food that I've had outside of Flushing, NY. Hunan Bar serves American Chinese, Hunan, and Sichuan style dishes (with at least 30 dishes from each cuisine). I ordered the Stir-Fry Pork Belly. It came with green peppers, scallions (cut in a way such that they absorbed the sauce and had a very pleasant flavor), deliciously sweet black beans, and 'hot spicy' red peppers. Both the flavor and spicy of the dish were outstanding. The dish also came with perfectly sticky steamed rice which absorbed the oil from the dish and added another filling yet tasty element to the meal.  In addition to the extensive menu, they have canned soy milk and jelly drinks. I suppose these are helpful in suppressing the spiciness of some of the dishes. (Some of the authentic dishes can probably be prepared very spicy).  Overall, the dishes were more expensive than the other Chinese restaurants in the area, but the quality is superior.  Also, the staff was helpful and friendly. I would rate Hunan Bar 4.5 stars if I could.",

It was not crispy and just loaded with a salty sauce that was overwhelming. I was not thrilled. I didn't even eat the entire dish! And if anyone knows me, that is a pretty big deal.

    "text": "This restaurant/bar is situated on Atwood, close to Forbes. It is a combination Cuban and Chinese food restaurant. I had been there before for the Cuban food, which is very good, if you like Cuban please see the reviews for Black Bean.   Walking into the establishment, you wouldn't think you were going to get an authentic gourmet meal. It is on the second floor of a building that reminds you of a shoddy college apartment interior. The carpet is of the indoor/outdoor variety. The tables and chairs are the kind you would find in a cafeteria. The flat screen TV blares the news or a game show and the lighting is fluorescent.   However, it is also packed with people speaking Mandarin (good sign). In fact the waitstaff mostly speak Mandarin as well (another good sign). There are Chinese food and Cuban food menus. On the Chinese food menus, you will find classic Sichuan dishes such as Ma Pow tofu and Chong Ching Chicken. There are also dishes that come from other types of Chinese cooking, such as normal Cantonese dishes (broccoli shrimp, cashew chicken) My wife and I had recently been to the Sichuan province (Cheng Du) and deeply enjoyed the food we had there. Usually \"Spicy\" at chinese restaurants just means a subtle kick, but anything labelled \"Spicy\" on the menu here is a SEA of fresh toasted red chilli peppers and sweet firey happiness.     A seafood hot pot (prepared in the kitchen) was ordered, it came out in a large bowl absolutely stuffed with vegetables and seafood, made in the non spicy fashion. The broth was homemade and did not taste as though it came from a packet, the seafood was fresh and well prepared. My wife ordered the Ma Pow Tofu. It came out in a pie dish floating in chili oil with freshly grated peppercorns, firm tofu, and mountains of ground pork.  The staff didn't speak great English, but we didn't have trouble communicating and the service was fast and friendly.  We've been to many Sichuan restaurants in the states and this was the most delicious and authentic Sichuan food we've had since visiting Sichuan.  Close your eyes and let your taste buds transport you to the best in asian cuisine.  I can't give it a 5 because once you open your eyes, you'll see that you're still in a run down undecorated dive, but atmosphere aside, the food is as good as you're going to find this side of the Atlantic.",

Spicy dishes are good in general. Veggies and some plain meat dishes can be a little too plain. Normal dishes deserve a 4 star. Fish, chicken, Gan Guo (Dry pot) are my favorites.  Their hot pot has a huge portion. I mean it is all-you-can-eat. But the starting portion is most likely enough for a person. They also have a wide selection of raw material, which is mostly very fresh. Recommended for large groups if budget is not a problem. Hot pot deserves a five.  Food here is a little over priced, but you can get special dishes generally not available in other restaurants in town. As its name indicates, they are specialized in Hunan cuisine, which is in many ways similar to the spicy Sichuan cuisine. But a wider selection of poultry, different ways of cooking fish and several special dishes makes it a unique place in Pitt. Can be a little crowded during weekends.",

Stick to one cuisine -- generally speaking when people try to dabble in different cuisines none of them are done extremely well.  Truth be told I was out on a quest for Mexican food I found on yelp.  But, both restaurants closed at 7pm and I was out looking at a few minutes after 7 so this place caught my eye.  I can't tell you how the cuban food tastes; but, I had something called the \"Hunan Fried Rice\" which is house special of sorts.  It was amazing.  It had eggs and bacon in it along with quite a bit of other flavors.  A bit of a language barrier -- I asked for no mushrooms and the waitress thought I was asking for no hot sauce.    But, they brought some on the side and just a little bit of it did the trick.  It was very very hot.  Point is I loved the place and glad I stopped in.  It was within my budget also.",

The English-speaking servers are nice and fast and it seems like they are in charge here. I haven't been here for a year so I don't know if the staff has changed. There is an older Chinese lady who can barely speak English but is very sweet. She kept trying to speak Mandarin to me (I can't speak Mandarin, unfortunately) and ordering was almost impossible... I can point at the item I want to order on the menu but how am I supposed to get the idea \"I want it not spicy\" across through body language? Haha. I feel a bit torn about this because as a server she is really not up to par but she needs a job (who doesn't?). A lot of patrons here actually speak Mandarin so she can do her job... just not for me.  Another problem is that one of the younger servers was a bit impatient with my Indian co-worker. My friend doesn't like soy sauce (he claims to have an allergic to soy sauce... of course you can ask if he's allergic to soy sauce how come he goes to a Chinese restaurant? haha). Anyway, he put the order in and specifically asked no soy sauce be added to his dish. The dish came back with soy sauce mixed in so my friend asked that the order be made correctly again. The waitstaff said \"well we are very busy we can't serve you anymore.\" My friend was mad and he ended up talking to the English-speaking server (the manager?). The dish with no soy sauce was finally served. I don't know - perhaps the restaurant was really busy at that time and thus the server did not want to deal with soy sauce issue.   Overall, service is hit or miss, just like many Chinese restaurants. Other than that, food is pretty good and inexpensive. Good for students on a budget.",

Every dish I've tried here always hits the spot. For a restaurant serving Hunan food, I'd say the spice level is very reasonable-very flavorful and hot but the spiciness never take over your palate. My boyfriend and I come here at least once or twice a week since it opened a while back and we've yet to taste anything subpar.",

Also, customers cannot choose the amount of tip because they will charge the tip automatically if you pay by card. Anyway, i don't like this restaurant, and i won't go to this restaurant anymore.",

There was a sign on the counter written in Chinese that if you pay cash, you get 5% off your bill. We paid cash but they didn't give us the discount.  We come here for their hotpot bowls most of the time. These bowls are huge and filling. Personally, it's too flavorful for me and it ends up hurting my throat half way through. I also try not drinking the water that they serve because I'm not sure if they filter it or not and they serve it at room temperature (I guess that I'm used to cold water). I had their other dishes such as the sweet and sour spare ribs and I did enjoy that.   Overall,  it's an okay restaurant and you need an acquired taste for their food which I like but wouldn't be able to eat it too often. But I would come back!",

But that definitely doesn't meet the quality that one would expect from a four-star restaurant.   First few strange things I noticed was the shabby furniture and environment, as well as the paper towels you're given instead of napkins. Not only that, the server was consistently trying to get me and my friend to finish our food and leave, and  has given us water that I questioned even came from the tap with its chemical flavor.  As for the food, I ordered one of the ma lat spicy bowls. It definitely had a rich brothy flavor with plenty of toppings. Though other then the amount of food that was in the bowl, the quality of the meat was old and dry and felt like it was hastily put together.  Also I fear for the men who attend the bathroom together using the urinals that are parked only 1ft away from each other without any divider. The hygiene in there is quite questionable.  Overall, I think if you are looking for Chinese food you certainly can find it here, but the quality of the environment, service, and food definitely do meet the standards of a four star restaurant.",

I went for their AYCE ($23/person) with a bunch of friends the other day with no expectations.   The sauce bar they have is limited - but contain the basics: garlic, sesame paste, sha cha paste (I think), soy sauce, vinegar, scallions, and cilantro, which is good enough for me.  The base of the soup had a decent spice level, and I'd say I have higher tolerance for spicy food than most. Personally, I think the flavor of it was better than Shabu Shabu a few blocks down and even comparable to the famous chain Mongolian hot pot, Little Sheep, going around.  The only negative is that they bring out a huge assortment of food and a lot of it goes untouched. The amount of food waste is ridiculous. Next time, lll probably send some back before starting.",

    "text": "We came here mostly because of the appetizing photos of the Chairman Mao's pork belly on Yelp. So that's what we got, along with water spinach and crispy tofu. We noticed that the dishes were pricier than usual, but realized when we got our food that it's because their portions are fairly large in comparison to other Chinese restaurants. Definitely way too much food for two and more appropriate for four (or even five) people. The pork belly was very good (fatty, of course, and therefore delicious) and came with bok choy. Honestly, this one dish should've been enough for the two of us for dinner (hungry but not starving), but it was our first time here so we didn't know portions would be large. The crispy tofu was alright; probably shouldn't have ordered it. The water spinach was a little different in color than usual but taste was standard. Warning: Some of the items on the menu that don't have the spicy sign (such as the crispy tofu) can still be a little spicy, as expected at a Szechuanese restaurant.   There were rolls of paper towels (instead of napkins?) placed on each table which I found a bit strange. They could also work on their interior more; it seems like all they did was put some photos on the walls and forgot about the rest of the restaurant.   The two ladies who served us were very friendly and the food is generous in portions and apparently authentic, so I can see how it has some pretty loyal customers.

So I told them about what I found.  Soon after, one guy who look manager came to me and aggressively asked back \"isn't that your hair?\".  I found it really astonishing that he should be so rude to customer. I didn't mean to cancel order or take out my dishes, etc. Just wanted to warn them so that it will never happen again for other customers.  On top of that, me and my friend's hairs are very long and dyed in bright color, which proves the hair in my food is not from us.  The manager kept being rude. He finally took my dishes off from the bill but took 15% tips without our permission.   I swear I never go back to this restaurant, ever again. Don't waste your time and money.",

I've tried several items that I haven't before, including the hot pot. That is an item worth mentioning, as it is perfect for a wintertime warmup. While a bit pricey, it can easily feed two, and the spiciness and broth will leave you feeling both full and hot.  In the summer, I enjoy coming here during the lunch hours for their smaller lunch items. While this menu is only a subset of their regular one, there are still way too many to choose from. We've taken a liking to some of the tofu dishes, such as with bean sauce or fish, as well as the pork belly. Very good deal for some of those, as they make them pretty authentic.",

The food here is authentic Chinese style and even better than some restaurants in China.  I love the fish here sooooo much! And you should gather more four people for dinner so that you can share several kinds of dishes at the same time. The price is about 15 bucks for a meal on average and that's a little bit expensive for a student without income. So I usually come here when I have something to celebrate or I want to eat fish so badly.",

But that's because this is REAL food. My mom teaches Chinese cooking. She grew up in Nanjing and Taipei. I've had the fortune of being treated to lots of good Chinese food through my whole life.  I was able to order beef stomach, pork tongue, and pork intestines ALL FROM ONCE PLACE. And it all tasted fantastic. Incredible!  The food here tastes  just as good as you would expect in ChongChing, Beijing, Flushing, Chicago, or LA. I have moved in all those cities and eaten around. No compromise because it is Pittsburgh. But also the serving sizes are definitely generous. They give rice without charge. The food comes fast. They don't accept American Express. This is legitimate GREAT tasting Chinese food.  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough. It is not so pretty. No gimmicks. Bare bones bathrooms. But that's authentic Chinese at its best.  So come here for wonderful Chinese food. Go somewhere else for alcohol.",

The amount they give you is huge and and it was super exciting seeing the massive plate brought in, and I really appreciated the big variety of meat, fish balls, and vegetables. They have a small table with sauces and ingredients you can mix together.   Price is pretty good for all you can eat hot pot! You don't choose, and instead they just bring out the entire huge platter out at once, so I would recommend coming with more friends if you want all you can eat. We didn't quite manage to finish which felt kind of bad since the leftover ingredients can't be packed away or anything.   Not the most clean and hip looking of places but food was great I'll definitely be back!",

The potatoes in the second dish were mediocre but the meat was definitely very juicy.   * Price vs. Worth: It was around $13 a dish and I would say it was a good price for it's worth. I hear a lot about their lunch specials which is around $10 and it sounds like a steal.   Will I come here again? - 100% yes.",

    "text": "OVERALL: tasty Sichuan food perfect for \"mala\" (numbing) spice lovers. Lunch specials are great value - especially the noodle dishes. One of the best restaurants in Pittsburgh for authentic Chinese food.  Hunan Bar is one of my favorite places to go for lunch specials. It's close to many college campuses including CMU, Pitt, and Duquesne, and in a convenient location. There is almost always no wait, and service has been reliably fast every time I've been there.   As for the food, Hunan is known to be one of the spicier Chinese restaurants in Pittsburgh. Many Chinese restaurants market themselves as having spicy food, but Hunan's food actually lives up to that expectation. If you're a fan of numbing spice, definitely come here.  Overall, the food is flavorful and has a very authentic flavor to it. Although I'm not a fan of Americanized Chinese food, the food from the non-traditional menu, such as moo goo gai pan, is pretty good. Some of my favorite dishes are the fuqi feipian (sliced beef, tripe, and beef tongue in chili oil), beef and chili pepper, green beans and minced pork, and mapo tofu. I also have to give kudos to Hunan Bar for their generous portions of noodles. I've had the dandan noodles here, and for a low price of a $6.99, they give you a huge bowl that's enough for two meals. Same goes for the zhajiang noodles. Leave it up to Hunan to keep you full for a long time!",

A couple next to me was doing hot pot and it looked amazing. I want to go back for hot pot next time.  I had a few Sichuan dishes which were very good and spiced well.  It's not my favorite Sichuan place in town but a great place to go for lunch when I'm at work.  The interior is a bit dingy but the service was excellent.",

I have also been here for the all you can eat hot pot and was definitely not disappointed and know for the future how much to prepare for; however, the spicy broth is very spicy so next time I think I'd stick with just the regular broth (I'm fairly good with spice as well and like my foods spicy). For my single hot pot bowl I've been getting the lamb hot pot (pictured) and I have been getting medium spice which has been consistent. The only thing with the hot pot bowls is that because there are a lot of ingredients there seems to be differing amounts each time, besides the meat which has been the same amount (I've gotten it 3 times and the amount of meat is consistent). But don't get me wrong it's more than enough to fill your stomach! The staff are all very friendly and are good at explaining the orders as well. For my go to hot pot bowl they're more than willing to switch out ingredients for me and not to mention you can also get different kinds of noodles if you do not like the glass noodles which it originally comes with. Interior is okay, not extravagant but not something I would complain over. I am definitely gonna be here a couple more times for my lamb hot pot before I leave Pittsburgh!",

It is a lightly fried chicken coated with spicy sauce and cooked along with red and green peppers. It is served with a bowl of steaming hot rice. The quantity and quality are good for the price. It is well cooked and well seasoned chicken. I was very hungry and was able to finish the lunch portion and also it is tasty which made it easier to finish the lunch portion.

However, I saw another table of 6 people do AYCE and there was so much wasted food. Hunan Bar really needs to re-do their AYCE and instead of bringing an entire spread out at once, customers should be given a menu with all hot pot items, so they can choose items and reorder as they go. That way small groups can do it and big groups won't waste so much food.  Ultimately, my boyfriend and I did the hot pot combo with half spicy and half white broth. Both broths were good and the ma la broth was flavorful, but a little more greasy than I'm used to. It came with a plate of sliced beef, plate of sliced lamb, 4 shrimp, enoki mushrooms, bok choy, cabbage, tofu, SPAM, and vermicelli. While it was decently filling, the spread was missing a lot of the traditional hot pot stuff I'm accustomed to - fish balls, meat balls, quail eggs, etc. The sauce options covered all the basics with shacha, garlic, chili, cilantro, scallions, soy sauce and vinegar.   The waitresses were nice, but service was pretty abysmal. I told my boyfriend if he saw any waitresses, to flag them down for more water because we might never see them again. I had to get up several times to find them and ask for things.   I've definitely had better AYCE hot pot in DC and NYC for the same ~$25 price. They also included a mandatory 15% service fee in the bill. The place was pretty packed though, so maybe stuff other than the hot pot is worth coming for.",

    "text": "Spicy food probably be my favorite thing on the world. Came here based on friend's recommendation. Food is pretty good as in Pittsburgh area. Wide range of choices. There are even more than ten special dishes written on the special board. My favorite dish is the ground pork sour bean with rice noodle. And the price is very reasonable compared to other Chinese restaurant in that area. The only thing made me disappointed is the service. The servers never smile, in fact, never smiled to customer. Will go back if really craving for spicy food.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Hunan Bar for a non-hot pot meal and, even knowing I loved this place coming in, it exceeded my expectations.    STEAMED FISH WITH CHOPPED CHILIS: The obligatory order here.  Or, at least it ought to be, as one of the signature dishes of Hunan region.  I wanted just the fish head, but in the absence of its availability, settled for a whole one.  The dish was cooked in much more chili oil than I would have liked--a bit excessive even compared to this dish's usual over-oiliness at typical Hunan places.  But, the result was transcendently tender flesh.  I do not remember the last time I had cooked fish that was textured so perfectly.  The taste of the chili topping was right on as well.  I enjoyed the hell out of this dish.  SWEET & SOUR PORK RIBS:  A favorite of mine, this dish was done magnificently here.  The pork was the perfect amount of chewy (an important texture for this dish cooked authentically), and the sauce was a magical, sweet, sticky elixir that I wanted to drown everything in.  White sesame seeds and scallions on top were icing on the cake.  I could eat this dish every day.  LAMB SOUP:  This was on special, and True to what the server told me, it was nothing but lamb and water, and it was absolutely delicious.  As a lamb lover, I really appreciated the deep flavor of the broth.  The amount of bone-on lamb included was generous too.  This tasted like the ideal of what I would want if I were making it in my home kitchen.  Food-wise, a perfect meal at Hunan Bar.  The only downside was the BAR part.  I came in expecting to order drinks for my birthday and was sorely disappointed.  They had bottled/canned beer and Sutter Home red wine in portion-sized plastic bottles, but that was it.  I couldn't even get a shot of vodka in some bubble tea or something.  Sad sauce.  The bottles behind the bar are apparently \"for show.\"  So, please come here for dinner.  Please definitely don't expect to get your drink on with it.  Order the scary spicy fish.  Man up and eat it.",
