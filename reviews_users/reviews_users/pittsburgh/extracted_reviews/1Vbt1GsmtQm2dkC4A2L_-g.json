The one sweaty guy we saw working as host/waiter/and perhaps also as cook was pleasant enough, but the walls were filthy and decor drab. Menu was a mix of basic \"Chinese\" dishes and some \"Indian\" plates like biryani chicken. Food was just ok - not super fresh and colorful - and I got sick with stomach distress, etc.",

    "text": "I just had my first Subba experience today as takeout, and I have to say, I'm impressed! Cheap and delicious. I got the Nepali chicken and veggie momo. The nepali dishes come with a gravy-style main (think indian curries), some amazing dal, and some veggies in a dry sauce. All of it was delicious! The guy asked me if I wanted it spicy or medium and I said somewhere in between. Be warned, they are generous on the heat. Maybe not for you if that's not your thing. But I happen to love it, so I was very pleased! The sauce for the momo set my mouth on fire, but it was delicious. The momo had a thick, chewy consistency to the dough, which is something I really love in a dumpling. The filling was moist and beautifully spiced. And I could eat a gallon bucket of that dal. The chicken appeared to be boneless thigh pieces, and the flavor was excellent. It was quite a bit of food and definitely made a pretty big lunch and dinner for me. At $15 for two full meals, I'm very pleased. All in all, this place is great. I can see how the service might be slower sometimes due to a very small staff, but it appears to be a small, family-owned place and everything else about it makes any potential wait worth it. I'd rather have a bit of a wait than see the prices go up if they hired more staff, but I'd love to see an awesome place like this grow and be successful in the area!",

The lamb and chicken Nepali dishes were both fantastic, although the lamb was the hands down favorite. Each came with 5-6 little side dishes that were all tasty additions - some chopped savory Nepali greens, pickled carrots, lentil soup, etc. Finished up with \"Indian flavored tea\" (aka chai) that was so creamy and rich.  The owner is just getting started and clearly knows Nepali cooking. I plan to come here often and everyone else should too.",

    "text": "This restaurant is definitely one to add to the rotation of favorites!  We started with the steamed vegetarian momos; they were delicious, plentiful (eight!), and served with a dipping sauce unlike any other I'd ever tried.  So good.  We also got an order of vegetable pakora, and those were really different from the sort you get at Indian restaurants--softer and almost creamy inside with lots of subtle flavors.  Yum!  After this mountain of food (we did not expect appetizers to be meal-sized, especially at such low prices) came our entree platters.  We ordered from the Nepali menu and got these wonderful trays of small dishes, each more delicious than the next.  I don't usually care about daal, but Subba's is amazing.  The chicken, the vegetables, the pickle-- everything on my tray was a treat.  The flavors were varied but complemented each other really well.  I stopped feeling hungry about five bites in, but the deliciousness kept tempting me back for more.  So worth the indulgence!  And all of this at really, really low prices.  I almost laughed when we got the check; so much cheaper than you'd expect for the quality and portion sizes.    They make their mango lassi with coconut; you need to try this.  The staff was so nice!  The place is clean and cute.  The kitchen, which you can see on your right as you enter was spotless.  Subba's Nepali menu isn't comparable to anything else in Pittsburgh right now.  This place is a gem.  Just go!",

They have a varied menu so the non-adventurous can enjoy fried rice or general tsos chicken. The real treats are the momos (veggie were better tasting and spicier than meat option) as well as the Nepalese plates. Parking is pretty easy. There were plenty of spots on either side of Cedar.   The only drawback was that we were a group of 13 people. Sometimes we had to grab the waiters attention for water or  to ask about something. As well, they forgot two plates of food but everything else came out quickly, hot and delicious! They were gracious about splitting checks and having some pay with cash, others with card.

I decided to eat here after hearing reading several decent reviews on the Allegheny City Central Facebook page..  The food here, in my opinion, was excellent.  I shared the pan-seared Momos as an appetizer, I had the Nepali Chicken, and my boyfriend had the General Tso's chicken (he wasn't feeling as adventurous).  Everything was well-seasoned, well prepared, and delicious.  The service we had was great, very friendly and informative about the food.    I will say that Subba did not have the best ambiance and it did take awhile to get our food - even though there were not many people inside.  I know this is a new place and hopefully they are still working out some of the kinks.  I think if this place could re-decorate a bit, maybe paint, lower the lights, have some candles, and promote itself as a BYOB - I think this could be a real hidden gem.  If you feel like trying something new I recommend giving Subba a try.",

Also, yes, the food is flavorful and sort of spicy to those who aren't used to spice, so be sure to ask before you order. (There's something for everyone here if you just ask.)

The owner was cook, server, and cleaner. And he couldn't have been more friendly.  We started with the dumplings. Delicious and plentiful, and the sauce had a real kick. I got the lamb platter for my main... it was filled with a colorful assortment of sides, and the spices and flavors were so diverse. Everything was tasty, and seemed quite fresh.  The decor needs some serious work, but nevertheless, it's an experience worth checking out. And the value is great... we left stuffed for only a few bucks.",

We walked in and stood at the door for about ten minutes, because although there were 3 tables of diners and a few people waiting for food, there were no employees to be found.  We were seated and then left alone to peruse the menu.  We ordered within ten minutes--I got the veggie nepali plate, the husband got sesame chicken, and we got veggie momos to share.  And then we waited.  And waited, and waited.  Two couples walked in and walked out while we waited, because the only employees at the restaurant were in the kitchen the whole time (?).  The momos came and they were AMAZING.  Flavorful, with a delicious spicy sauce.  The food came, and it was just okay.  Kinda lukewarm.  My plate was very similar to the thali plates I have had at various Indian places, but honestly, I liked them better at the other places.  I may go back for momos and to give this place a second chance--but I will DEFINITELY be calling it in, or bringing at least one bottle of wine, because start-to-finish we were there over two hours, and had been planning on a quick meal.

When we arrived, the owner (I think) was in the kitchen helping the chef.  I know this because a friendly family that dines there all the time, and the restaurant's only guests last night, told me so.  We took a seat and he came out shortly thereafter to greet us with a mile-wide grin.    I ordered the Lamb Nepali and my mumsie ordered the Chicken Nepali.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but what arrived was a series of small silver bowls with a variety of ingredients surrounding a bed of jasmine (I think) rice.  I threw everything onto the rice and hoped for the best.  I was not disappointed.  Nepali not your thing?  Subba also offers a Chinese menu so you can chow on General Tso's 'til your heart's content (and it did look delicious).  At $25 total for the two of us, it was a cheap date and the food was wonderful.  On the spicy side, so be forewarned, but a lovely departure from the casino buffet which we were tempted to drown ourselves in after losing our collective shirts at Rivers earlier that day.    Give Subba a try. The owner is so sweet and the food so delicious - truly a diamond in the rough.",

These are spicy. Very good but spicy. This was a nice touch of out of the ordinary but I don't need to go back. Unless they start serving that tea to go.",

He insisted on rounding the bill up to $10 so that it would meet their self-imposed minimum charge.

    "text": "Working in Allegheny Center Mall, there aren't a lot of great food options.  I was excited to learn about Subba and was eager to try it for the first time.  The first time I tried to eat here, the \"open\" sign was lit, but the door was locked.  I was glad I had only made a short walk from work rather than a special trip.  I later learned that sometimes they are there and \"open\" but for some reason don't have the door unlocked.  If you ever go and find this to be the case, give them a call and they will likely come down and unlock the door for you.  You enter a side door and have to go up a staircase to enter the restaurant.  Try not to be put off by the barren appearance of the stairs and the basic appearance of the restaurant.  The food is wonderful.  I had the chicken Nepali.  It comes with several sides and each was more deliciuos than the next.  There is a lot of food, so come hungry.  There were some pieces of chicken that were a bit tough, but with as tasty as everything else was, I overlooked it.  I also ordered the momo (dumplings).  They come with this incredibly tasty sauce that has a bit of a zing to it.    If you aren't adventerous enough to try the Nepalese cuisine, they also offer some traditional chinese options and even a few sushi rolls (although all but one was blocked off with tape on my menu).  Overall, a fun and different dining experience.  I recommend giving it a try.  Just make sure you call first to ensure the door is actually unlocked...",

    "text": "The neon flashing Open sign got my attention and called me into the doorway around the corner from East Ohio Street and the Park House. Subba overlooks the Park and is three blocks from Allegheny General Hospital. Stumbled on this second floor Northside no-frill bargain eatery. Pittsburgh has a Bhutanese refugee community and this restaurant is the result. Started with Momos- a dumpling that was very good. We also started with an appetizer Chicken Sadaka that was up spiced with chilis and was a stir fry of veggies and chicken. Great flavor- dry chicken- very good flavor. For the entree we had the Subba Special Combo. Again a blend of wonderful chili spiciness- the Bhutanese stir fry was over loaded with lamb, shrimp, beef, broccoli, cauliflower, onion, cabbage. I would have this again but not the combo- too many proteins in one dish for me. I would pick one. I want to return and try more dishes.They have a Nepalese menu that I would like to try. They also have Chinese and Indian sections of the menu. Subba is a rare find and should be tried. The steep staircase in not for all. The place is gritty right down to random decor and the mouse traps. Support our Pittsburgh immigrant community and eat here. All are welcome here. The flavors are great and the price is right.",

    "text": "I stopped by tonight at 5:15pm for dinner with CM after a visit to the Andy Warhol Museum.  A couple of quick tips on finding this place: first, be advised that the location pin on Yelp is a block west of the restaurant's actual location, which is on Cedar St. across from Rita's Italian Ice (the address on Yelp is correct).  Second, although the entrance was clearly marked (under the awning), signage indicating that the banquet room was upstairs was confusing (banquet room = dining room in this case).  Since this place fits the profile of my favorite type of ethnic restaurant (a little-known hole in the wall with great food), and since I'd never tried Nepali food before, I thought we were in for a treat.  Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.  CM and I started off by ordering the momo dumplings (chicken filled), which were okay but just your typical steamed dumpling with a spicy kick.  For our entrees, we ordered from the Nepali section of the menu, with me ordering the chicken and him ordering the fish.  The Nepali entrees are composed similarly to Indian dishes, consisting of a large dish of white rice with a protein in sauce, steamed saag (spinach), daal (lentil soup), a sauce, and a small dish of pickled vegetables, all served on the side (see photo).  We certainly got a lot for the money here, both for the app and entrees!  My principal complaint is that everything was quite a bit spicier than I'd like, since I wasn't asked to specify a spice level.  Both the dumplings and the chicken made my mouth and throat burn, and the amount of spice overpowered, rather than enhanced, the flavor.  I've been to S.E. Asia and have eaten my share of spicy food from this region both there and here, so I can only imagine how Pittsburghers with less tolerance for heat would react.  Worse still, our waiter (who I strongly suspect is the owner) wasn't conscientious about keeping my water glass filled.  When my water ran out, I tried taking a sip of the daal to calm the heat, but this exacerbated the problem, since even the daal was overly spiced (I've never noticed daal being spicy anywhere else).  I ended up just waiting a bit to allow the sensation to die down, which fortunately seemed to do the trick.  I'd strongly recommend ordering a mango lassi to help cool the heat.  Aside from the water filling issue, our waiter never returned to collect payment once he gave us the check.  CM and I ended up going to the front counter to pay our check, which I assume is what's expected, although this is unclear.  There was even a hiccup in paying the check, since the system wouldn't accept CM's Discover card despite signage indicating that Discover is accepted.  As the absolute final straw, the mukhwas consisted only of anise seed, with very few candies sprinkled throughout.  While I'm glad to have had the chance to sample Nepali cuisine, suffice it to say that I'm not in a rush to return, due to the overly spicy food and inattentive service.  Aside from these problems, the flavors of the food just weren't as distinctive--or as delicious--as I was hoping.  It's too bad that this is the only restaurant serving Nepali food in PGH, since I suspect that this place doesn't do it justice.",

We had the vegetable momos - that's what everyone said to get for the appetizer. Good advice. One appetizer is plenty for two people.  We had the Chicken Nepali and Pork Nepali main dishes. These are wonderful. Served on platters with various sides and sauces - along with a wonderful serving of rice to eat with. This is definitely spicy food, but my order was not overly salty, which I read previously.  We also took one reviewer's advice and ordered a side of aloo paratha, again another great suggestion. One serving is plenty for two people.  Dinner was great. More than enough food. Very reasonable prices. The waiter was very nice and helpful.   If you're not familiar with the location, it's in the North Side at the corner of East Ohio and Cedar, right around the corner from the Subway restaurant. As other reviewers note, the entrance door may not look like the right spot - but it's the door with the Subba sign above. And you will walk up the stairs to the restaurant. It's all fine.

It certainly was not crowded, and I wonder if it ever fills up. The menu is simple and easy to peruse, and we focused primarily on the Nepali stuff since that's what is supposedly unique here--not sure where else in Pittsburgh this can be found. The momo is a staple, which is a nice fusion of dumpling and curry flavor. More importantly for the Asian palate, the dumpling skin was great texture--not too soft but not too hard either. The thali (lamb, specifically) was tasty and had great variety. While the portion of actual meat was a tad small, the rest of the platter made up for it, with lots of herbs and spices in the sauce for flavor. Definitely reminded me of the Jackson Heights community in Queens, NY.",

As the six of us made our way across the very sticky floor, we kept the faith and we seated at our table by a friendly waiter. The menu is fairly simple and easy to read. our orders were taken quickly and easily. the food was very good, highlights were the chicken dumplings, naan and vegtable curry. An absolute standout was the porridge dessert. Do not miss this. All at our table enjoyed it immensely. The hot indian tea was also especially good.  Value for price can't  be beat, portions are generous. I have little patience for lack of cleanliness though, and this place rates very low. If you don't offer hand napkins in the bathroom, then you need the powerful hand dryers. What they had mounted on the wall was less powerful than a travel sized blow dryer.",

Deo Kumar Subba is a refugee from Bhutan by way of Nepal who perfected his technique in Kathmandu before coming to the US 5 years ago. He had worked as a cook at the Aisian buffet in the Rivers Casino until taking this recent plunge to have his own place. The food is wonderful and homemade from ingredients he finds in the Strip District. Try the Momo, Nepalese potstickers with a spicy sauce he makes himself. We especially like the Nepali options;the Sadako chicken and pork are excellent. Agree with the other reviewers that service, ambience, menu, etc. are a work in progress but would expect those to improve over time. The portions are generous with special touches like his hand cut veggies and everything is very reasonably priced. Would recommend a trip to the Northside to try the authentic cuisine of this unique restaurant.",

The exterior is unassuming.  You enter on the ground level and walk up a flight to the restaurant.  You are greeted by the chef and maitre de.  He is one and the same.  Decor is sparse but clean.  The music and incense speak to a traditional restaurant.  We only tried the Nepalese and IndoPak food.  Momos are the pork dumpings - they were very good.  We enjoyed a roast pork appetizer as well.  The chicken biryani had little flavor but at least the chicken was tender.  The Nepalese lamb curry was tasty as were the sides that came with it.  The beef stew was tasty but the beef was a bit tough.  The Naan was a potato version that was so-so.  The rice was greasy including the biryani and this was the disappointing part of the meal.  The most attractive part of the meal was the quick service and the price - dinner for three was $44 without a tip.  So in short, cheap but greasy.  I like places that try hard so I will be back.",

We tried both the chicken and vegetable momos (steamed dumplings); we liked them both although we all agreed that the chicken was tastier. Among us we also ordered chicken biryani, chicken curry, and a lamb and pork dish. All were good, as was the naan. We ordered primarily from the Nepali and. Indian selections. The portions are generous and the food was very inexpensive ($44 for everything). The service needs some work, so I recommend leaving sufficient time if you are going somewhere afterward. Entrees were brought out one at a time (well, one, then another one, then two), but since we were all sharing it did not matter as much. I will definitely go back.",

I'd never eaten Nepali cuisine before, so we enjoyed the veggie Momo's and Nepali chicken. I thought the seasoning and spice level was spot on, and you can't beat the price. As others have said, expect the decor to be plain and unimpressive, but it is clean and bright with lots of 2nd floor windows. I also enjoyed the lovely background folk/flute music. We will absolutely eat here again next time we have an event on the North Side.",

We tried to put in a reservation ahead of time for a party of seven, but there was confusion over the phone.  When we arrived, it was not busy.  Our food came out at different times - first person served was done eating before the last person got their food.  All meat in the dishes was overcooked, and possibly even re-heated.  Curried vegetables on the side had been frozen - the flavor was good, but the veg had obviously been microwaved as there were icy cold spots, and, it's impossible to miss the texture of potatoes that have been frozen.  Some of the sauces were pretty good (Nepali), others bland (Mongolian chicken, biryani, lo mein).  The momos and their curried dipping sauce were very good.  We'd like to see any restaurant succeed in our neighborhood.  We may try this place again in the future after they've had time to work out the kinks and find a way to provide consistent fresh food.",

The decor isn't anything exciting, but often times those are the best restaurants. It was also very clean feeling, despite the lack of ambiance, and the prices are extremely reasonable.   We went with a large group (9 of us) and split two orders of momos for the table.  Everyone enjoyed them and the dipping sauce was amazing.  The sauce was a tad on the spicy side, so keep that in mind if you're not a fan of spicy things. They look like a pot-sticker, but have a completely different flavor profile, which, having never eaten Nepalese food before, I really enjoyed.   Everyone ordered various Nepali plates.  My husband ordered the lamb, and I ordered the pork.  The plates come out with a variety of items to add to your rice, including the same spicy sauce that came with the momos, some lentils, vegetables, and a variety of other options.  I basically dumped everything onto my rice and went to town.  Man, was it delicious!  My only complaint was that my pork had a decent amount of gristle and fat that I had to eat around.   I would love to come back here often and try many of the other menu options.   Definitely recommend it and enjoyed the food immensely.",

    "text": "A Thursday night adventure at a fairly quiet Subba for our first taste of Nepalese cuisine involved the #4 MOMOS (chicken-filled) and #41 LAMB THALI, with a HOT N SOUR SOUP and MASALA CHAI.    The food was a delicious blend of East and South Asian flavors, with the meaty momos and their tangy curry dipping sauce being a favorite.  The momos were nicely filled and the wrappers not too thick, though the consistency seemed factory-, not handmade.  The dish could be improved if the accompanying sauce weren't served chilled, as it put a slight damper on the warm momos, but that could be personal preference.  The \"Nepalese food\" platters are a great choice for first-time diners looking to try a bit of everything.  I wasn't a big fan of the pickles or the dal, but everything else had great flavor.  The stir-fried veggies in particular were great--a mix of zucchini, carrots, cauliflower, potatoes, etc. covered in a delicious curry.  The saag curiously tasted like lettuce instead of spinach but was delicious nonetheless.  I suppose my biggest takeaway of the evening was that you can cover pretty much anything in curry and I'll like it.  The main lamb dish was a bit disappointing--the bowl was much more sauce than meat, and the chunks of lamb themselves were way chewy and overcooked.  They were also just noticeably low quality cuts of meat, with lots of grisselly bits.  Normally, I wouldn't be so picky, but for the amount that we received (only 5ish small pieces in the bowl), I would at least expected chunks of tender meat at least.  If I'm being honest though, the part of my meal I enjoyed the most was the chai--the small but wonderfully spiced and lightly sweet cup of milky, creamy goodness was the perfect kick-off to my dinner.  I tried to sip it slowly but its deliciousness did not leave self control as an option.  The hot and sour soup I ordered as a comforting side was great as well, with your typical thick, cornstarchy restaurant consistency and packed full of veggies and swirls of egg.  It was super salty, perhaps too much so for most, but I'm a salt fiend and didn't mind one bit.  Don't a grand ambiance at Subba--it's your typical, bare-boned Asian eatery, and our one server took care of the entire, sparsely populated, dining room, but the food does come out quickly and satisfies a curry craving.  Not sure it's a repeat for me, but worth a try for something off the beaten path in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "In a nutshell: Serves Chinese, Indian and Nepalese dishes, but get the Nepalese dishes. The entrance looks a bit sketchy and you have to go upstairs to get to the restaurant. Affordable, quality, good tasting food.  So it's a bit scary looking at the front door and even the steps going upstairs might make you want to turn around and go somewhere else. Don't. Especially if you're an adventurous eater like myself. I've never had Nepalese food before and I'm so glad there is a place that serves it right in my back yard. The Nepalese menu isn't that large, but it's enough to get a taste. Based on other reviews, we got the steamed veggie momos which were eight little dumplings. They're similar to other Asian dumplings, but the sauce makes them different. The sauce is quite special and I have no idea what it is, but it is spicy, citrusy and perhaps a little curry-like. As our entree, we got the Pork Nepali, which was delicious. It comes with a variety of little sides like curried vegetables and pickled vegetables. The rice - there is something special. Maybe they cook it in butter and garlic or something, but it was so delicious on its own. My only gripe is that perhaps the Pork Nepali was a bit too salty, including the sides. However, when eating with rice or naan, it balances it out a bit better. The service was incredibly fast and the prices were affordable.",

It looks a little sketchy from the outside but inside it is comfortable and nicely decorated.  It was a bit on the warm and stuffy side though when we were there, as the Spring temperatures had started to warm up but they hadn't turned on their AC or fans yet.    I had some of the momos (Nepalese dumplings) for an appetizer and the nepalese lamb for my entree and everything was delicious.  They don't let you specify your spice level, but it was fine for me since I found it to be perfectly spiced.  However, if you don't like spicy food this might not appeal to you, since it was a bit on the spicy side.  The Nepalese dishes are served \"Thali\" style which means they are composed by a variety of small dishes in little bowls on a larger plate.  Prices were very reasonable.  The server was very friendly and helpful, though toward the end when we were trying to pay he did disappear for a bit and we had to find him.  The place is BYOB and they brought a wine opener and glasses for us but we had to open our own bottle.  They were a little slow on clearing old dishes from the appetizers when bringing out entrees, but otherwise service was good.    I might give this 3 stars if this were just an Indian or Chinese restaurant, but given that this is the only Nepalese I know of in Pittsburgh it provides a more unique experience than you might find elsewhere.",

    "text": "This is the only Nepalese restaurant I've experienced in the 'Burgh, though I've been to a few elsewhere, and we tried this place with some friends from a major east coast city. Our first impression was that the menu was a little bit odd - they offer \"American chinese food,\" some Indian food, and a Nepalese menu. We were also a little surprised by the location - nearly walking right past the place. When we did get up to the restaurant, we noted that there were only two other occupied tables, and we were meant to seat ourselves.  We ordered mango lassis and \"indian tea\" to start, which were all delicious (and so reasonable - all were under $2). We all ordered off of the Nepalese and Indian menu, and everything we got was nicely spiced (including for our one friend, who hates spicy food, who requested an \"extra mild\" meal). The vegetarian momos were SO tasty, and compared very favorably with the best momos I've experienced in the past. Their dipping sauce is mildly spicy, but excellent! Even my spice-hating friend liked it.  I ordered the Nepalese vegetarian meal, which came with lots of rice, all kinds of pickles, greens, and vegetables. My only complaint was that I wish I had gotten more greens. Others ordered the Nepalese chicken dish. One member of our group was a bit upset to find out that the chicken was breaded (not listed on the menu, and he has celiac disease). However, this person had enough other food that it was not a big deal. One other gripe was that they were out of all parathas/naan, which I was really looking forward to.   The chicken curry and the Nepalese chicken were similarly spiced, and were delicious over rice. We had easily enough food for leftovers, and the price was incredibly low. Everyone was happy and very full after we ate. Paying, as others have mentioned, was a bit confusing, as it seems we were supposed to flag down our waiter to get the check, and then bring it back to him in the kitchen to pay. Not the best service, but the food, portions and price make up for it.  I'm looking forward to going back, and I'm excited to try many more Nepalese menu items.",

    "text": "I've enjoyed Subba since moving to the North Side several years ago. I especially enjoy bringing new friends who rave over how delicious it is.  But there is a MAJOR PROBLEM with a leak in the roof that is threatening this delicious restaurant and a SLUMLORD who has no intention of fixing it. To add to that, the owner of the Subway below Subba has no interest in helping Subba's owner make a case for fixing the roof - but it's likely only a matter of time before the water becomes a problem below as well.   Is there anything we can do to help this beloved restaurant?",

    "text": "SETTING: \"Hole in the wall\". Located on the second floor. Clean inside, no frills when it comes to decor. The focus is on the food.     FOOD: Full disclosure: first time having Nepali food, so to be fair I don't have anything to compare it to. But I will say that it does remind me of the \"typical\" indian cuisine in terms of spices, spiciness, and flavor. I had the Pan fry momo and Napali Chicken.    Pan fry momo appetizer was solid. Came with 8 fried dumplings (think potstickers) and a dipping sauce. I love potstickers, so this was just what I imagined it would taste like, with some indian-like spices infused into the meat filling inside. Definitely gave it an extra kick!  The Napali chicken came on a large plate full or rice, with the chicken itself in a small bowl simmering in a sauce, some \"gravy\"? (excuse my ignorance...I never had Napali food before!), and some tiny sides of veggies. Overall, it tasted good and all the flavors came together wonderfully. Although, I really was hoping there would be more chicken. There were maybe 4 pieces in that small bowl--it almost felt like it was a side dish and not actually part of the main entree. With the sauce (a savory, runny texture) that came with the chicken and all the sides, it was very easy to clean the plate and be satisfied.   SERVICE: I think the owner was the one who brought out the food, and he was a sweet gentleman. It always warms my heart when I see an honest person that may have immigrated to the states, working hard in a restaurant to share his country's culture with others. The place wasn't too busy, so the waits were not too long. You are not approached very often for water refills or other things, but I think they would be available if you ever needed something. Very low key.     IMPRESSIONS: If you cannot handle spicy, then you might want to rethink your visit. Or you can tell them to go mild on your dish. Everything was good and prices were fine, but the experience was not really too memorable, other than the fact this was my first time having Nepali food. Again, I really admire the owner's hard work, so hat's off to you, sir. Keep doing your thing!",

    "text": "Subbas's asian restaurant is unique and worth visiting if you are in the mood for authentic Nepalese food - an apparent marriage of Indian and Chinese cuisine - in a \"no-frills\" atmosphere. The selections we had were outstanding.  The menu is large and tries to hit on many Asian cuisines including sushi. I would never order sushi here - more on that below. We stuck to other Yelper's suggestions on what to eat.   Sadako chicken - sauteed (fried?) crispy chicken with spices, onion and cilantro, tart lemon. A great appetizer or even light entree.   Pan fried Momo - more traditional dumplings steamed then browned. Great spicy dipping sauce.   Nepalese chicken - braised in curry-like sauce with light al dente rice that looked like it had been lightly fried, and came with nice sides (daal - chickpeas/potatoes, saag - sauteed greens) two sauces and \"pickles.\" This dish was great, we shared everything which was enough for two. Prices are reasonable to cheap.   There is a downside. The ambiance needs major improvement. This is not a first date place or even a business lunch place. We were hoping the drab exterior was not representative of what was inside but the interior was very drab, a bit too warm for a summer day and smelled like incense. All the blinds were down - maybe the a/c was broken(?). There are several doors you have to open to enter the restaurant all of which were visibly dirty, filthy.  There was a door open to the kitchen right when you walk in and the kitchen looked dirty. The white walls appeared dirty. There was visible leak damage apparent on the ceiling and peeling plaster on the walls. The upside was that the tables were clean,  as well as the bathrooms and service was fine though a little help on the menu would be welcome. They did make the effort to put some chachkies around for decor.   I hope the owners read and take this criticism and make improvements to the space - very easy fixes - a fresh coat of paint, dont burn incense, and clean the doors! I really want to be supportive of good local restaurants and i dont need frills to be happy. There was literally no one in the place on a Saturday afternoon. I hope they can improve the space to bring in more customers.",

Everything was good, but you must get the Chicken Momo and the Masala Tea/Chai. The dumplings are some of the best we've had (and we lived and traveled in China too), and the chai is the wonderfully creamy, sweet chai that you can get at any roadside stand in India and only very rarely in the US. Our entrees were excellent as well - the Chicken Datsi was creamy and delicious and the Nepali Chicken was an excellent sampler of various salads and dishes. Go and enjoy!",

    "text": "This is as authentic as it can get for a Nepali Cuisine at least in Pittsburgh. As a fellow Nepali and an avid cook myself - I'm pretty confident about my taste bud when it comes to food. Although, this place serves Indian, Chinese and Japanese - I highly recommend anyone who visits this place to go with the Nepali Menu.  Although some of the items might share some resemblance with Chinese or the Indian Dish - this is far from the truth. The Nepali dish has a certain uniqueness when it comes to flavor.  My highly recommended items on the Nepali Menu would be the Momo(s) either the pan fried or the steamed. They're both home made including the wrapper and the sauce that comes with the Momo is very spicy. So, you might want to request the chef to decrease the amount of spice.  The Thali (Rice, Variety of vegetables, Lentils and meat curry of your choice) was very good. However, the amount of curry spice used were a little more than what I wanted.  Last but not the least - the price is super reasonable. I'm sure they will raise the price as it's popularity grows but at least for now try all you can.",

We came specifically for the Nepalese food as I had never tried it before. We tried the pork , lamb, samusas and chicken fried rice. The lamb was amazing, very juicy and flavorful . All the entrees came with curried vegetables and steamed rice. There were also Nepalese pickled veggies that my friend referred to as a \"warm condiment\".

We started off the the pan fried momos and chicken sadako. Both were amazing!!! The chicken sadako was especially well seasoned, with a very spicy sauce which was to die for. The momos were nicely pan fried without being oily. The sauce complements them really well!  For mains, we had the chicken and pork Nepali sets. Both amazing!! Presented beautifully, with all the curries and vegetable varieties complementing each other very nicely! We also ordered aloo paratha to go with our mains, which was perfect! Just like what you get in India!   We were extremely pleased with the food here. Service is fuss free, which is not a problem for us as we don't like to be bothered during meals.

    "text": "Subba was my first experience with Nepali food. From Google searches I expected it to be a cross between Chinese and Indian food, which was a pretty accurate assessment. First we had the Sadako chicken, which was crispy and flavorful pieces of chicken tossed with onions, herbs, and lemon. I chose it based on Yelp recommendations and did not regret it. Even after the entrees arrived we still worked to finish the dish. The Nepali entrees (one lamb, one chicken) came with a plate of rice, lentils, vegetables in a sauce, and two different pickled salads. It was delicious. I very much enjoyed my lamb, and my friend talked about his chicken for days after. The flavors and preparation are definitely similar to Indian dishes, but there is a distinct quality to the food. I would surely return if in town again.",

    "text": "First off, this little restaurant in the North Side looks super sketchy from the outside. The exterior of this place really needs a major face-lift to make it more appealing. After entering the front door, you have to hike up this narrow stairway to another door. Once entering the second door, then you reach the restaurant.   The restaurant itself is quite spacious with plenty of seats for large groups. The decorations are all over the place though. I became quite confused with the Bollywood music playing in the background and Chinese zodiac placemats under my silverware. Are they going for a fusion feel? Service was a bit lacking since there was only one guy there.   I am a huge fan of Nepali food and was super excited when I found out there is a Nepali restaurant in Pittsburgh. I had the chance to try three items on the menu: pan fry momo, sadako chicken and the Nepali pork dinner plate. The momos were crisp and oily. They're just fried dumplings, nothing special. The sadako chicken was the worst though. After looking over the pictures posted by other yelpers, I felt cheated! The sadako chicken that I got was pretty much a salad of chicken pieces, carrots, cabbage, white onions, white onions, white onions, white onions and more white onions. This is raw white onions I'm talking about--like 50% white onions. Such typical plate fillers, they could've been a little more creative.   For entree, I had the Nepali pork plate. The plate came with white rice and pork in curry sauce with a side of some brown sauce, mung bean soup, stir fried bok choy, deep fried vegetables and pickled vegetables. I thought there were too many unnecessary side dishes. I spent the majority of my dinning experience figuring out what I'm eating. I rather they have one solid, well-made Nepali dish so I can direct my attention on that. The pork in curry sauce was well cooked with a crispy edge. I liked that they fried the pork before throwing it into the curry sauce to prevent it from getting too mushy. Thumbs up for the pork texture! The curry was super spicy though so be careful if you have sensitive taste buds. Out of all the tiny side dishes, my favorite was the fried vegetables with chunks of sweet potatoes.   Overall the food here was just ok. The items are definitely hit or miss. I don't like how inconsistent the quality of their food is. Subba has potential, but it needs to step it up a notch. I recommend going here for the experience, but not a place I will go out of my way to check out again.",

If Nepali food isn't your cup of tea, they have chinese and indian food as well (I haven't had a chance to try those yet).  As other people have said the momo dumplings are worth trying (you get around 10-12 for $5) and you could probably make your meal out of just that.  The mango lassi might be the best lassi I've ever had.   The decor could use a little updating, but you're here for the food. Service was good and the food came out very quickly.  The place is also BYOB.  Subba is a hidden gem and worth checking out.",

If you are looking for what is good on the menu I would recommend...   1. The General Tsos Chicken: it's not overly sweet like a lot of take out seems to be.  2. The pork momos: the dipping sauce they come with is a perfect combination of tang and spice (you won't go wrong if you get the veggie momos instead)- fried or steamed 3. Chicken Lo Mein: perfect amount of sauce, its not drenched   There's nothing fancy about the inside but don't let that steer you away- the staff is always friendly and quick. It's close to PNC Park if you wanted to go somewhere a little less mainstream before a game!",

They do have menu items for the less adventurous eaters who enjoy Chinese (fried rice, lo mein, & general tso's) or Indian (curry & biryani), but if you enjoy Indian I HIGHLY suggest you try the Nepalese food - you won't regret it! My husband and I got takeout last night and ordered veg momo (full-flavored, spicy vegetarian pockets of heaven!) and the Lamb Nepali Food and the Vegetarian Nepali Food - also amazing - rice + veg in a wonderful brown sauce + (stewed lamb) + pickled veg + sauteed greens + daal + the most delicious firey sauce. This was our first time trying Nepalese food and we are in love! We couldn't stop raving about the food to each other as we were eating it. We will absolutely be back with friends and family!",

It's a little nondescript on the outside and I might have had trouble finding it if I wasn't with a friend who had been there before. It's not the fanciest place in the world and it's on the second level of the building, so you have to walk up a large flight of stairs that does NOT feel like its leading to a restaurant. The layout and decor might be difficult or intimidating for some people, but I promise it's worth it! Get up those stairs.  The menu seemed to be a mix of American-Chinese, Nepalese and Indian food. We started with the chicken momos, which were dumplings served with a very spicy dipping sauce. My friend and I both ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein while our other friend ordered a spicy curry pork dish. I can say hands down it was the best Lo Mein I've ever had in my life. The portions are huge and I'm embarrassed to admit that I still ate the whole thing. I couldn't help myself. Everyone loved their meals and we all cleaned our (very large) plates.  We chatted with the owner, asking for menu recommendations and he was very friendly! I'll definitely be going back here soon!",

The restaurant was mostly empty and it was just our large group and another (rather drunk cheerful and lively) large group. I think they had way more wine than us (quality not quantity)!  We ordered an array of appetizers, they were tasty. I liked the spicy vegetable mono, which was mentioned in several Yelp reviews I read prior to my arrival.   I ended up ordering the Lamb and Vegetable Nepali dish. The lamb and veggies came one one plate sitting in a generous base of some sauce. The other plate was white rice, nothing crazy about it (some reviews mentioned weird rice).  The meat was juicy and although there wasn't a ton of it, I was full.   The prices are pretty decent so I would just order a variety of dishes and experiment with something new, take the rest home.  Love that it's BYOB, I would return.",

    "text": "It's weird, for as many reviews as this place has, I had no idea it existed.  Probably for good reason.  It is kind of hidden in a well traveled area.  Most people think of East Ohio St. as just what is street level.  All good places, but start looking up.  With this place it is housed upstairs above a Subway and Boost Mobile.  You have to enter around the side of the building and go up some stairs.  Once upstairs it kind of feels like you may have entered an apartment building.  That is until you go down the corridor and enter the dining area.  While in the dining area it appears that a lot of their business is from people ordering take out, the constant flow of people stopping in to pick up their orders is wild.  Once we were seated we had menus in front of us and started to look it over.    The menu consists of many different Asian cuisines.  When we finally go to place our order we basically got the same thing.  We both ordered the Chicken Thali from the Nepali section of the menu.  Before we dug into that we decided to try two appetizers.  One was Vegetable Momo and the other was Vegetable Pakora.    The appetizers came out first.  The momo was nothing more than a vegetable stuffed dumpling.  Very tasty and they do easily fall apart, so be careful when eating this.  The pakora was wonderfully breaded and fried vegetables.  Both came with this spicy dipping sauce that gave a good kick.  While we were munching on these our main course came out.  The plates were wonderfully laid out, picture perfect.  Before I dug into the plate I decided to give each separate part a taste.  Each part had a distinct flavor.  Some spicy, some pickled, so cool to the palate.  I then decided that I would start mixing things, expand the flavors.  I started mixing with the rice and taking healthy bites.  The chicken was best left alone and eaten by itself.  Because of the spice I found myself having a runny nose and some watery eyes, but it was well worth it as the food hit a spot in me that I didn't know I had.  I felt satisfied eating this meal.  So very flavorful.",

At least the Nepali and Bhutanese food is; i've heard the Chinese food is only there by demand since the owners are Nepali refugees.   Oh, and it's BYOB, but no corkage fee.  We got the Chicken Momos to start and they were amazing.  The sauce had a hefty amount of spice, but I hardly overpowered the flavor in the sauce or in the momos themselves.  They were the star of the show!  My partner got the Chicken Thali, which comes ready for you to mix in with rice, and it was also amazing with just the right amount of spice.  The flavors were equisite! I got the Pork Datsi, which was a slow build on the spice for sure, but was still incredibly tasty in its flavor profile.  At the risk of repeating myself, it was also amazing.   The one blemish I give my meal is that the rice seemed to be a bit stale, but that was mitigated once I mixed it in with the Datsi.",

The rice was central to the platter with savory and sweet items filling the serving dishes in the periphery.

A man came before we rang and asked us to wait a minute. Several minutes go by and another man, who I presume is the owner opens the door. The phone's been ringing he says.  No worries. We're in and it's us. We look for the menu and wait. Another person comes in at this point and she's picking up an order. It turns out it was a larger order, so it's a while before the owner comes by to take our order. Momo, chicken biryani, and pork datsi. The owner is also the only one cooking the night we came. He had several orders for takeout arrive as we waited and another party came. The food still came out in a reasonable amount of time. Momos were delicious! We got the steam ones and they were cooked to standard, good amount of moisture. Hubs chicken biryani looked colorful and flavorful. I took a bite for taste. The pork datsi was hearty with potatoes and a cheesy like sauce. Those little red chilies are deceiving! I ate one whole and was really wishing I had more than water. Delicious nonetheless.  We waited a bit to pay. Again, even though there were two other men working, it was the owner leading some important tasks. Once he was able to step away from cooking, he changed hats to be the cashier.  All in all, it's a cool spot. I can see why you might order takeout rather than wait. Food is delicious and definitely had flavor unexpected for Pittsburgh.",

Just a little hole in the wall over on the Northside. We were the only two there at 1 in the afternoon.   We were greeted by a gentleman who was also the cook. He was a one man band that day, taking care of us our entire stay from the drinks to our ticket.  He made recommendations and happily answered any questions we had about the menu. We ordered an appetizer of the veggie momo and I got the lamb biryani as my main dish (lamb, curry rice, potatoes, veggies). The flavors did not disappoint. The food came out quickly and piping hot! Everything was cooked to perfection. I got a hefty serving for $10 and asked for a box to bring some home for later (there was no way I was saying goodbye to these flavors for the day).   I love that there is a combination of food at this place. Asian, Indian, Nepalis all in one restaurant. I want to go back and try the Nepalis food and more momos. Promise me you will check this place out!",

I went with my girlfriend on a weekend, they had 4 or 5 tables. The service was okay, and by that I mean it took our server 10 minutes to get us water. He was running around doing a lot of things but we felt ignored for a lot of the time we were there.   The momos are what sold this place for me! They were delicious, and it was a great portion size.   Wonton soup was seasoned pretty well. Hot and sour soup was okay, it's not something I would ever order again.   I ordered the chicken Nepali and it was good! I has never had Nepali food until I came to Subba. The dish was really fun to figure out what everything was and how it tasted. It felt super authentic and the spices were spot on!   You really get a bang for your buck at this place. A lot of food and great flavors all around! I'd like to come back and try their Chinese food.",

To start my husband and I had the momo dumplings--steamed and stuffed with vegetables and served with a fantastic, spicy dipping sauce--and the pakora, breaded and lightly fried veggies served with the same sauce. We would've been over the moon with just those two appetizers, but we also split the vegetarian Nepali platter, which had a bunch of different, great sauces & veggies to enjoy with rice. We shared a mango lassi, which is a delicious creamy/fruity drink that could almost be a dessert. BYOB with no corking charge was a great bonus. While I agree with other reviewers that the decor and ambiance are nothing special, the food is so incredible that it doesn't matter. We'll be back!",

I had the Nepalese lamb, which is a great choice served with a nice pile of rice and six sides/sauces and a little rice pudding-like dessert.  The building itself isn't as good as the food, so don't take a date or a business associate here. Think \"Pittsburgh dive bar aesthetic\" and you'll be fine. The entrance is a little creepy and immediately you have to walk up a flight of stairs. Cardboard makeshift repairs on the ceiling and a cracked window.

    "text": "Came in with my bestie for a quick meal before hitting up the Warhol late night. She had never had Bhutanese/Nepali food, but her Bhutanese colleague had told her that Subba is the best example of the cuisine in the city. I've been to India and have eaten many a momo in my time, but am less familiar with the broad spectrum of Bhutanese and Nepali food as a whole. So we were excited to try Subba.  As previous reviewers have stated, the restaurant is on the second floor of a fairly nondescript building and the decor is spartan. But the smell coming from the kitchen was out of this world! We were quickly seated and ordered--we had an order of steamed chicken momos, my bestie got the lamb Nepali platter, and I had the pork Nepali platter with a mango lassi. The momos were as good as any I ate in India, but SPICY--at first I thought the spice was coming from the tomato chutney served alongside, but the chicken inside the momos is richly spiced with turmeric, cilantro, onion, and hot chili. This is a flavor combination I truly love, but those who are squeamish on spice might want to pass these by or maybe try the veg momo. We gobbled ours up, and the delicious, not-too-sweet mango lassi took the edge off the heat.  The Nepali platters are a stunning amount of food--for between $10-$12 you get a large bowl of your chosen meat curry, rice, dry curried veg, curried greens, daal, green mango pickle, more tomato chutney, and a small cup of kheer (rice pudding). It is a LOT of food but we surprised ourselves and ate it all. The pork curry was richly spiced and flavored with clove and cardamom (I bit into a cardamom seed so you know it's good!), the veggies (cauliflower, broccoli, potato, squash, onion, and celery) were spicy and tender, the daal was AMAZING--it tasted almost peanutty, a flavor I haven't tasted in Indian daals--and the pickle was garlicky, not too salty, and amazing. The flavor profiles were slightly different, but it reminded me of the comforting home cooking I ate in Indian homes. Rustic, like the food your grandma would make if she were Bhutanese! The kheer was delicious but a little thick from being in the fridge. They do offer it on its own as a dessert, and I bet the consistency would be better.  Service was a little slow (only two people working the tables, and they spent a lot of time back in the kitchen) but the food couldn't be beat. I'll definitely come back for a big bowl of curry and more of those amazing momos. As Pittsburgh welcomes people from more and more places around the world, our food only gets better and better. I couldn't be happier.",

J had the vegetarian Nepalese platter. It was spiced with garam masala which gave it a warm character and slight heat factor. The veg mix was carrot, broccoli, onion and a potato or two in a thick gravy. A large plate of rice accompanied the bowl as did two additional sauces and a pickled side dish. My lunch mate ordered a lamb dish and this is where I'm knocking off stars. Half of the meat was clearly past prime and mixed with fresher meat. That's a problem. We brought it to the servers attention and nothing was done to correct this situation. All in all this is a nice addition to East Ohio. Even my carnivore buddy said he'd come back. He just might go vegetarian:)",

    "text": "I dined here as it was convenient to the hospital at which my wife was having a surgical procedure performed, and the restaurant received a favorable review just this week in Pittsburgh CityPaper.    I arrived at a couple of minutes after opening time of 11:00 a. m. and the place was not set up for business.  The gentleman who opened the door at the top of the stairs told me that he would turn the lights on, and he did so that I could proceed up the steps.  The restaurant is not modern or beautiful, but I like that it is spacious and that the tables and booths allow for the ability to speak without having to raise one's voice.  I was the only person dining for the time that I was there, about forty minutes.  The menu is red plastic and says \"Fine Foods\".  It is obviously a remnant from some other restaurant of long ago.   I like that one has a selection of Indian, Chinese, or Nepalese dishes.  I ordered egg roll (four pieces for $2.55, a very nice sized appetizer for one and ample for two), and chicken lo mein for $6.95.  The prices were fair for the portion sizes and the food was tasty.    The lo mein dish contained many pieces of succulent chicken, but it was spicy, something I have not encountered in this dish before, and which is not indicated in any way on the menu.  I would have preferred less spice.  What was greatly disappointing was the lack of attention I received.  The server/owner brought one glass of water that was mostly ice, and which was quickly emptied.  There was no refill, no quality check, and not a great deal of pleasantness.  The gentleman simply brought the dishes to the table, nothing more.  If this were my restaurant and it was relatively new, and with only one customer, I would certainly try to make the individual feel that he and his business were appreciated.  I received no sense of that.  The restaurant is open from 11 a. m. to 10:00 p. m. seven days a week.  It is not in an area in which I would feel safe after dark.  This is not a place I would go out of the way for, but it is fine for a good lunch when one is in the area.",

The momo - hand-made dumplings full of chicken (not scary processed something) that go to a whole new level with the spicy dipping sauce.  The Napali food is amazing. Some have lamented not enough meat, but Nepali food is not meat focused. It is an ensemble platter with multiple styles of vegetables, saute rice, daal (lentil soup - more protein) and a sauced meat dish.   Decor leaves to be desired, service can be slow, but if you want to leave your 'Merica behind and indulge in spicy yumminess - get yourself to Subba.",

I have had their napalese lamb multipal times and it's amazing, you get so many things to sample in one meal. The food is very colorful and has a verity of spices and fresh ingredients. The only sad thing I can say about this place is that every time my partner and I have come, we have been the only customers there. I wish the place was more widely known about.",

The Lamb Nepali entree was super flavorful and had multiple veggie sides with buttery jasmine rice.  Their mango lassi was a perfect pairing to cool off the spice -not too sweet or too yogurt tart.",

I have taken many friends here and everyone was always impressed.",

The momo (dumplings) are delicious; the vegetable biryani is delicious; the veggie Nepali dish is delicious. Raita and lassi are also great. The menu lists \"Indian tea,\" which is code for chai--it's great. Also for some reason the prices are from like 1995. It's nuts.  Service is extremely solicitous and sweet and friendly, from some very nice guys who also seem to work in the kitchen and don't speak especially strong English. Expect to wait a few minutes for them to come out and help you, but if you wave them over they're happy to help immediately.  My parents and I went to a few fancy well-known restaurants around Pittsburgh and our best meal by a wide margin was at the divey, homey, very inexpensive, crazily delicious Subba.",

    "text": "Subba Subba Subba Subba... Subba! (to the tune of the O'Jays 'For the Love of Money,' because Subba is like money. For your belly.) This place is delicious. The spice profile is fantastic, and the ingredients always seem fresh - which should be a given, but in Pittsburgh you never know...  I go here for the Nepali food (as that's their specialty), so really that's what I'm going to review. The momos are seriously addicting; so very good, and probably like nothing you've tried before. I mean, yes, they are Asian dumplings, but the flavor profile is not ordinary or \"regular.\" Also, the Nepali meals are fantastic, and come in large portions (easily split between two small people) which is a great deal for the price. Plus, the staff is lovely! But coincidentally, therein lies the one drawback... I've never seen more than two people working there at once, and while it is charming and quaint (and again, they are the nicest!) it can make for a bit of a wait. They are always apologetic, and trying their best, but I put this caveat in here for folks who are looking for a quick bite. Maybe it can be quick, but I've always waited longer than I would have expected to. Not excessive or ridiculous, just longer than one would guess for a small, no frills Asian joint. That being said - I think it's worth it! And will continue to wait if need be, because once you've had it, you will crave it - and no other type of food will suffice. Seriously, try this place.",

    "text": "Whatever you do, please do yourself a favor and order the Sadako Chicken. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauteed veggies had a nice amount of crunch that provided a lovely contrast.  It's definitely on the spicy end of the spectrum, but the heat was offset nicely by fresh cilantro, sliced tomatoes, and lemon wedges. Light, flavorful, and fresh. One of the best dishes I've had in quite some time.   Also enjoyed the vegetable momos. Pillowy pockets of dough stuffed with a potato filling that reminded me of an Indian samosa that was steamed instead of fried.  Very tasty.  Entree wise, we went with an order of Nepali Chicken and Nepali Lamb.  Both were excellent. The lamb was a bit too well done for my tastes but still had a great flavor. Both dishes were presented in a way that lent itself to a choose-your-own adventure dining experience. You get a plate of rice and several little side dishes that contain a variety of delicious vegetables, lentils, chutneys, sauces, and pickled goodies. So you're only limited by the depths of your own imagination.   Subba is quite unassuming when you walk by, but please don't let that scare you away. Once you walk up the steps, you'll be greeted by a wall of amazing smells and friendly people.  Restaurant was clean, prices were fair, and the food was truly top notch.  Can't wait to go back again!",

The entrance is non-descript - you would almost miss it if you weren't looking and one must climb 2 flights of stairs to get to the restaurant (note for people with mobility issues).  The space is large with basic decor and the staff was very efficient the night that we went.  They have a range of offerings from basic \"Americanized Chinese food\" to authenic Nepalese and other Asian dishes.  I ordered the shrimp lo mein and my boyfriend ordered the Mongolian Beef while our friends ordered the Lamb Biryani and the Hunan Chicken.  The prices are inexpensive and you get a lot of food for the money - enough to share.  Overall the food is good, and I would like to try the Nepalese food the next time I go.  Definitely recommend checking this place out.",

One of the best chicken dishes I have had in Pittsburgh. It consisted of well-seasoned semi-fried chicken with raw onions, garlic, cilantro and tomatoes cooked w/ lemon. Vegetable Momos - Again, amazing. Doughy skin stuffed w/ vegetable filling. The sauce that comes w/ it is unique and really tasty. I don't know what the sauce is made of, but it was a little bit sour and tangy. Pan-Fried Chicken Momos - Good but I preferred the vegetable ones. It comes w/ the same sauce. Nepali Chicken - This dinner set came w/ a bowl of chicken curry (dark meat chicken which was tender!), an extra small bowl of the curry sauce, fried potatoes and vegetables, pickled cabbage, ?pickled greens and a side of the same sauce that came w/ the momos. It also came w/ a plate of rice. Some people rave about the rice but I did not like it at all....it was too hard, and it tasted cooked but w/ an un-cooked texture. Kung Pao Chicken - I don't typically like kun pao chicken but my boyfriend ordered it and it looked good so I gave it a try. I liked that it wasn't overly breaded. Not my favorite but the boyfriend enjoyed it quite a bit.  Service is almost nonexistent but I let it slide b/c it was a family establishment and it sounded like they were busy in the kitchen.  I don't usually venture over to this part of Pittsburgh for food since it is a bit far from where I live, but I would definitely come back here.",

We waited for 20 minutes (no refill on our drinks) before the miserable server came back (I mean hostess aka waitress aka wtf) to tell us they were all out of the appetizer. What? It was certainly out when I ordered it. Anyway, no apology from her. I asked how the other appetizer was and she said \"yeah it's good\" so I ordered it instead. She almost walked away before I asked \"can we order our meals as well?\" With a nod, we both ordered the Nepali lamb. After another half-hour, she didn't come back. No refills, no apologies for the delay, literally the only table sitting there with no food. Give me a break! I was a server. I get it. It's not easy, but just a simple \"sorry for the delay, here's another drink\" would've alleviated my scorn at that point. Hire more help! The food we ordered likely wasn't made yet, but if it was, now it's going in the garbage. I will never recommend this place. Get a grip. Good service and average food=success. Zero service and invisible food with a waitress playing hide and go seek=failure. See you in my nightmares, Subba! I'll never get to try your delicious cuisine.",

The momo dumplings were the kind of chewy that I love, with a delicately spiced filling and a most amazing dipping sauce. The sauce was pretty spicy (I detected what I believe to be habanero, yum!) and it did overcome the aromatic quality of the momo, but it was soooo magical, I would be happy to put it on anything, all of the time! And I was in luck, because more came with the entrees! The Nepali vegetables and the Indian curry were the exact same dish - we didn't mind only because it was especially delicious; appropriately spicy (this time more like chili and/or cayenne), not heavy or oily and decidedly savory (not sweet like some Asian styles) with freshly cooked broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and potatoes.  One of the veggie dishes (not sure if it was the Nepali or the Indian - again they were the same dish), came on a thali style platter with homemade pickles (mild), a little mix of greens and garlic, an *extremely* tasty dal, plus my new favorite condiment. And rice, both entrees came with rice - nothing too remarkable about that, but the rice did seem to have been cooked in a broth, maybe with a little butter (I'm not a fan of that latter bit, but I feel that it indicates particular care in the preparation).   I really, really look forward to returning to Subba (wish it was closer to me).",
