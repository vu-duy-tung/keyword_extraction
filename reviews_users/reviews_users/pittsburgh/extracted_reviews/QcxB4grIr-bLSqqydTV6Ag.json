    "text": "I was in Millvale to do laundry at the 24 hour laundromat. Intended to eat at Pamela's but they were closed. I am very glad they were. I was greeted warmly by the owner/waiter/chef, and shown to a table. Drinks were promptly served. So many delicious sounding things on the menu made picking one thing difficult. My daughter and I decided on the Steel Workers Breakfast. It comes with 3 eggs your way, choice of meat, choice of potatoes, choice of bread and two pancakes. I chose over easy, sausage, home fries  and white toast. My daughter went with scrambled, ham, home fries and rye toast. The food was amazing. The best thing was the home fries. So crisp, yet soft, the bell peppers and onions gave them a wonderful flavor. Both my eggs and my daughters were cooked perfectly. She is very picky about her eggs and usually whines that they are over cooked. These were not. Everything really was above and beyond any breakfast I have had outside my grandmothers kitchen. The service was great as well. The only drawback is the wait time from placing order to the arrival of the food. This time delay is because nothing is precooked. However, for the quality of food I received I will go back over and over. Totally worth the wait. When the person in the kitchen has a passion for food and enjoys cooking quality food it shows. I highly recommend a trip to Millvale Diner very soon.",

The breakfast menu is extensive from eggs and bacon to a reuben omelet. Every comment about the food has been very positive. On the negative the service has not always been the best. On our most recent 2 visits there were new servers who did their best to provide us with a positive experience. We will be back.",

Shannon the waitress was totally stressed out because she said it was busy.........it was not, I'm a waitriess, I should know. She was awkward, and made me feel uncomfortable, not a pleasant experience.  The whole time we were there, empty tables were not cleared. The other waitress albeit young and most like inexpericenced asked us an another table if we saw someone take a tip off of another table, that was empty, but not cleared, and she should have cleared it as she walked by because I couldn't see hide nor hare of a bus boy. When I went to pay , this same waitress was flustered because she said the other waitress made her ring out customers at the register. Seriously? It's a small place! Oh and when I brought up my check, she actually said to me, \"Do I have time to take the drinks over to my table?\" I ignored her and just stood there.......they both verbalized comments that should have been kept to themselves.",

I had the special; gravy over biscuits (3), two eggs over medium and I also ordered toast in addition to the special. All I can say is yum! The eggs were perfectly cooked, the gravy was a rich white sauce with good quality sausage. The toast wasn't very toasted and not very warm, when I told the waitress this she immediately took care of it. The only thing off a little is it was after 1pm and they weren't serving lunch yet. When I asked when they started serving lunch I was told \"not until after 2pm.\" I'm not sure if that is all the time or just on Saturdays. I'm really glad the breakfast was so good.",

We decided to try this place, as it is right across the street. It was pretty empty, but worried me at first, but Pamela's has a big name and a lot of locations throughout the city, so it's easier for them to draw a crowd. We had a party of 8 and they seated us immediately.  Our server was great and even took orders for each of the 4 couples on separate checks. Yes,I know it's an inconvenience and yes, we should have all brought cash, but it happens! I've experienced some unnecessary eye rolls and attitude in the past and was very pleased when our server had the complete opposite reaction and didn't mind at all!   We had a mix of omelets, pancakes and some lunch appetizers. Everyone was really pleased with the portion size and the food. I definitely took half of my gigantic home. Plus, they serve breakfast all day which is #1 in my book!",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place, I really did. But they are just not great at customer service. You walk in & linger awkwardly until someone finally decides to notice you, then we sat at our table for about 20 minutes while no one even looked in our direction. When the waitress finally came over to take our drink order we told her we were ready to place our food order as well, she flat out told us no, you can't place your food order before I get you your drinks... Wait, what?? She literally refused to take our food order. Then, after insisting she MUST take only our drink order, she brings us over empty coffee cups and says \"your coffee will be several minutes.\"  So now, after not being allowed to give our food order, we still don't even have drinks. Once I'm given permission to order food, I order an omelet that comes with home fries & toast, I asked if they had rye, she said yes so I said \"ok, I'll have that.\" to which she responds \"just 1 rye?\" What kind of question is that?! Omg, the list of bizarre things this girl said/did just goes on & on. The food was decent (definitely NOT better Pamela's as some other reviewers have said) & definitely good quality & quantity for the price. But seriously, I cannot get over how poorly we were treated, not just by our server but the entire staff. They were all just warm bodies at best. It was like none of them had ever worked in a restaurant before, just totally clueless. And the food was not so amazing that one could overlook the extreme lack of good customer service. I would be willing at some point to give it one more shot in hopes that today was anomaly, but something tells me that's the standard.",

    "text": "This joint looked like something straight out of kitchen nightmares.  My friend and I were originally going to go to the really busy diner right across the street, but since they didn't take credit cards, we came to the Millvale Diner instead.   We walked in and the place looked like a ghost town. The decor was bare, the walls looked like an institution, there were a few tables scattered here and there, and the floor was not terribly clean.  Now the diner RIGHT ACROSS the street was slammed, so I was a tiny bit concerned about what I was getting into from the moment I walked in the door.  I asked the waitress to seat us somewhere cool since it was a 94 degree day, and the woman stuck us by the window.  After two minutes there, I asked if we could be moved away from the window as the heat was making me nauseous.  She moved us to a table closer to the kitchen.   She politely took our orders, informing me that to add blueberries to my pancakes it would cost an extra $1.50.  I shrugged, despite knowing that a pound of blueberries were only $2.99 last week when I bought them. I ordered a breakfast that consisted of two eggs (sunny side up), two pieces of bacon, two pancakes and home fries.  I saw the cook in the kitchen eating a bowl of cereal as I waited for my food.   I received my food about twenty minutes later, and my eggs were over-easy (not sunny side up), my bacon was over cooked and flavorless, my home fries had this disgusting reddish spice oil covering it.  The home fries also contained green peppers and onions.  I also had no pancakes. I waited a few minutes before asking for my pancakes.  When they finally arrived, they were crumbling apart, and I couldn't spread butter on them without them turning into butter/blueberry/flour paste.  What a joke.    Next time, I'll go to P&G right across the street. Never again.",

It's in a great location, especially being across the street from another diner that is extremely busy. It would be very easy to take advantage of that overflow if this guy would treat people with a little respect.

Just like before, we decided to come here after the line at Pamela's was too long. We thought maybe Millvale Diner would be better since the last time we visited they were still relatively new. We entered and there were about three tables of four and a few patrons at the diner bar. Our party of five was seated in the dining room, which still is very oddly decorated and bare. We were the ONLY people in this room. It was noon, peak dining hours on a Sunday. Across the street at Pamela's there was a line out the door and this place couldn't fill more than a handful of tables. Bad sign #1. The waitress immediately told us they were short-staffed, which seemed odd because there were definitely more than two servers and like I said, only a few tables of eaters. Bad sign #2. We sat for about 20 minutes and there was no sign of her. She never returned to ask about beverages or anything. We got up and left and returned to Pamela's to find the line much shorter and worth the wait. I don't know how this place is still open. \"Short staffed\" or not, the waitress at Millvale Diner could have at least gotten us some water or coffee straight away (or even just took our drink order!) to hold us over. We all agreed that if we had at least ordered or been given drinks we would have waited it out. Instead we were ignored for 20 minutes and they lost out on probably $50 + tip that they clearly needed.",

We walked down not knowing what to expect. Walked into the diner and a nice older gentleman greeted us with \"Welcome, we've been waiting for you all day, what's kept you?  Table one is all set for you.\"    We came in, sat down and the server brought us our menus and took our drink orders. It wasn't too long after that we had decided on what we want to eat. We ordered the Rodeo Burger and fries. The gentleman that greeted us went back and cooked our food, and it took a little longer than usual to prepare, but the gentleman, whom I assume is the owner told us that he makes all his burgers are prepared and cooked to order. He doesn't buy pre formed patties. That alone makes this place worth it. The food was outstanding, and very filling. The bill for what we got was pretty decently priced. When we come back to Millvale we WILL come here to eat again.",

The server was not very attentive - it took us 10 minutes to even get waters and coffees brought to the table, and another half hour or so for food to arrive.  The food was actually pretty solid when it did come - I had the Reuben omelet and enjoyed it, and my friends enjoyed their food as well.  We didn't even wait for our checks to walk to the register and cash out. The waitress had to look up all of our orders in the menu for prices, so it took almost 10 minutes for the 5 of us.  Maybe they were short-staffed from the holiday, but I'd avoid this diner unless you have some extra time (and patience) on your hands.",

    "text": "Bizarre hours and negative reviews had kept me from trying Millvale Diner, a start-up canteen that replaced Kayla's Cafe recently, but another Mr. Smalls concert left me with little choice for a fresh Yelp, so enter its doors I did.   Alabaster walls and traditional diner stools are essentially all one sees in terms of interiors, that and a man with an accent, a moustache, and a mission.  \"You keep it fresh, you can't go wrong,\" the man whose name I can't recall told me with a glint in his eye as I eagerly devoured a Mountain Man Burger, something he seemingly concocted with me, the warrior eater in mind.   Members and crew of several other bands including Affiance and Protest The Hero charged in shortly after I seated myself. We all ordered simultaneously, and within 5 minutes, food as on my plate and in takeout boxes for the musicians and roadies.   \"Do you have any help back there?\" I asked the middle-aged gentleman.   \"No. I do it all myself. You see, it's all about timing.\"  All I could do was stare.   From here on in, I shall refer to this man Burra Sahib.   And he had a challenge for me to complete...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmilehighcomics.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fbackissue.cgi%3Faction%3Dfullsize%26issue%3D78357032384%252073&s=803855771062c1583c4309fd5242b1128e09a7a716683eb1891c1dac895bd81c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">milehighcomics.com/cgi-b...</a>  \"You may use silverware, young man,\" Burra Sahib advised.   Two patties of hulking ground chuck, an over easy egg, raw red onion, onion rings, lettuce, tomato, American cheese, bacon, and mayonnaise were held together by a sesame seed bun and accompanied with exemplary battered fries. My teeth opened the morning godbeast with a gash that bled molten yellow yolk before I reached for weapons, realizing that my bare hands would not ensure victory.  The meat, cooked to a sublime medium-rare astonished with its freshness, savory beefiness, and soft texture, contrasting beautifully with the crunch of the vegetables and deep-fried, breaded halos, the bacon adding fat and brine. All told, this was a giant of a burger, one worthy of the heartiest carnivores.   <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DhzIWVFOLvLk&s=142eff45dfac620babc8763dfb78a66eb387beb962180dfd87d5c559a5239293\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=hzIW...</a>  Dessert was a humble cut of spongy, fudge-laden bake-sale variety chocolate cake garnished with a dollop of whipped cream and chocolate syrup.   Burra Sahib was pleased, cheering my win like a king would a gladiator.   \"Ah, a clean plate. I take it you didn't care for the burger,\" he joked.   I wished Sahib well, promised another visit, and headed off into the brisk air for...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D1iHRAnIA2Yw&s=6d36bb233143fff8b93ff534c0884e6b8285f64c7380d7062653be68b1163b30\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=1iHR...</a>",

Right across the street we were greeted and seated as soon as we walked in the door.  Our waiter couldn't have been more hospitable.  He even got me a can of Pepsi from the cooler in back even though they serve Coke in the fountain...top notch in my book!  Breakfast for me was 2 perfectly cooked over medium eggs, bacon, homefries and toast. The homefries were so good I could have made a meal of them.  My friend had the biggest western omelet I've ever seen.  It was so delicious she ate every last bite.  They have a nice selection of breakfast foods including a PB&J pancake and a pineapple upside down pancake.  The also serve lunch and dinner and are BYOB.  I can't wait to back to try more.  You definitely need to give this place a try.  It's not fancy but super friendly and the breakfast is great.",

The table was never cleaned, we are lucky we even got silverware. Apparently you're not allowed to order food at the same time as your drinks too. Drinks must be ordered first.

I ask how long the wait is and the waitress replies just you guys... Perfect!  I see another room I wasn't aware of so I go look in.... Three empty tables.  I told the employee that there were three open tables... She said really?  I thought there was just one.  So by your brilliant logic, you couldn't have sat us at the open table you knew about???  Then the group behind us is sat for no rhyme or reason (maybe an elderly person who couldn't stand or something)  We then get seated after making awkward eye contact with the woman behind the counter for a minute.  We get menus which had literally every possible item you could think of....  After waiting about 10 minutes for maybe a water or some coffee or something, someone comes up to us and asks if we've been helped her.  We had not and informed her of such.  She nods, says okay and walks away.  Other wait staff come by to fill coffee for others.... The original Mensa member who asked us if we had been helped then comes back and starts rearranging butter packets and salt on an adjacent table.    At this point of 20 minutes of zero service we got up and left... Like other tables had done before us.    Seriously avoid this place like the plague.  My guess is that you won't have to for long as they continue to alienate and ignore potential customers.",

I went with the steelworkers breakfast and was extremely please especially with the price of the food.  It was 3 eggs which I got over easy, with toast, home fries, bacon and two pancakes.  The pancakes were by far my favorite part.  They were crepe-like on one side and not too thick.  I didn't even need that much syrup.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  I enjoyed the seasoning on the home fries but I'm not big on home fries so I wasn't the biggest fan.   I would definitely come back here!",

There were a handful of small tables and a few barstools open and we were worried our group of 5 would have a long wait. Luckily, we were able to be seated immediately and they brought us into the back room which was larger with way more seating.   It seems like there was only one waitress at the time and she was the sweetest and extremely attentive. She did a great job with balancing so many tables and literally balancing cups of coffee / water. I started off with a water and tea and omg the tea came in the cutest little tea pot.   I ordered the eggs benedict. It was pretty good! I think I may prefer eggs benedict with a slice of ham over the pieces of bacon but i still enjoyed it. The eggs benedict came with homefries. I found that it was seasoned very well and i enjoyed those as well.  Overall, I think Millvale diner had great diner food and I am so happy we stopped in.",

    "text": "After literally running all over the city I had finally found time to grab a quick bite to eat.  With being in the Millvale area I decided to check out what was around.  I came upon Millvale Diner.    When I walked in here the place was dead.  Not a single customer in here.  I was kind of stoked because I thought that meant I would get quick, stellar service...well for the most part I was right.  The server on duty at the time was looking a little frazzled, maybe even a little worn out for the day.  I came in and sat at the counter and she greeted me and gave me a menu.  I placed a drink order and took my time to look over the menu.  I wan't in a hurry, and I didn't want to rush the server.  I finally did make a decision and thought that an appetizer would be a good way to go since I had plans for later that included a meal.  I opted for the Millvale Diner Potatoes.  The simple description made it seem like it would be a small enough meal that would hold me over.  With that decision I made my order.  The serve had a worried look on her face.  At first I wasn't sure what to make of it, but I found out why after overhearing a rather harsh phone conversation between her and the cook.  It seems that the cook decided to run an errand in the midst of the shift, basically leaving the server to car for everything going on at the place.  Eventually the cook did return, but not until after a decent wait...for an appetizer.  It was a good thing that the cook did return because not long after that conversation, other patrons started to show up.  Glad they got it sorted out, but you shouldn't stress out your server who is going above and beyond the call of duty for her post.  Anyway, back to the small meal, or at least I thought it was.  These things are the epitome of loaded fries.  For real.  Smoked bacon, tomatoes, onions, jalapeno peppers all cover the fries, then basically everything is covered with cheese and melted to lock it all together.  Sour cream comes on the side so you can dip, drip, or smear your amount you want onto each bite.  Remember when I had said I wanted something light since I had plans later?  Well this was basically a meal all by itself.  I was so full from this that I didn't want to think about food for a while.  Definitely something you get if you don't want to eat later in the day.  Cards accepted, television inside, ample seating, street/lot parking.  Bathrooms are a bit wonky, if it is not busy the back dining room is not in use.  In order to go to the bathroom you need to walk into this area, a bit odd when no one is dining in this area, but completely doable.",

I must add the food took a long time to arrive over 25 minutes for usually diner easy stuff  prices are average  would I return maybe...",

Food was ok, somewhat under-seasoned.  This seems like a smaller family owned business and I have seen the same one server both times when I visited.  Everyone was very nice and we didn't wait long at all for our food to come out.   We did not experience a wait on a Sunday morning and the food hit the spot.",

Got a bacon egg and cheese bagel, my boyfriend wanted hash browns and didn't get those because \"they ran out\". The bacon was probably thrown in the deep fryer as it was absolutely soaked in grease and was very hard to even chew. As soon as we got to our table we were told \"I'll be with you as soon as I can, I have a big table and we are short handed today\" ... okay. I hope the big tables food was good, because ours definitely wasn't this time. Time to find a new diner for breakfast.",

    "text": "The owner of this restaurant disregards the seriousness of food allergies and puts people's health at risk.   My friend and I stopped in today for a bite. She ordered a Greek salad, i ordered the western omelette. The Greek salad that came had iceberg lettuce, tomato, egg, gyro meat, feta cheese and croutons, which imo is more of a gyro salad than a Greek salad, but I digress.   The salad came with croutons. My friend has celiac disease and can't have even trace amounts of gluten found in bread found in croutons, which see didn't realize came on this salad. She asked the waitress to order a new salad because even picking the croutons off is risky.  The waitress took the salad to the kitchen and we could hear the conversation between her and the cook/owner. She explained to the guy the situation. I could hear the guy give her a hard time about it. First he asked if she requested no croutons. As if to blame the waitress for an oversight. She rightly said that we didn't request \"no croutons\" when it was first ordered, because we didn't. You don't usually request things that aren't expressly included, but I digress again. I couldn't make out the rest of what he said, but you could tell he was basically not trying to make us a new salad. Not even a minute goes by, and the guy comes out with a salad that has a lot more feta cheese than the last one, and seemingly no croutons.   My friend starts to dig in, and she finds a little goddam crouton in her salad. That dude, after specifically being asked to make a new salad, due to a food allergy, knocked off the croutons and sent the same damn salad back to my friend.  At this point, he was eating lunch in the dining room, so I asked him if he made a new salad or if he just took the croutons off. He fessed up and said he just took the croutons off. We both told him that was completely unacceptable! He began arguing with us, insisting that it was my friend's responsibility to ask about allergens and that we should have known that ALL salads always come with croutons. He told the waitress to take the salad and told my friend, \"No more salad for you!\"   At this point, I really lost my shit. I explained that I've never had a Greek salad with croutons, and that even if we should have done something different, it didn't change the fact that he knowingly and intentionally gave my friend food that would have made her very sick if she ate it.   I then demanded my check because i couldn't be in his presence for one more second. The waitress gave us the check and took the salad off, thankfully. I filled out my bill, tipped the waitress (still heated as hell) and left.   As I was sitting in my car I see the owner walking toward me out if the corner of my eye. I roll down the window, he gives me the bill and says, \"you signed the wrong copy.\"   REALLY DUDE!??? You're lucky I didn't walk out of your establishment entirely and without giving you a single solitary cent!!!  I signed the check while he literally carried on endlessly about how wrong it was of me not to sign the correct copy.   I told him to stop talking. Then I told him he was an asshole, and we parted ways with middle fingers in the air and a death stare that I'm pretty sure he lost.   Despite my delicious omelette, I for certain won't be returning to Millvale Diner.   The owner had ZERO concern for my friend's allergen request, despite the explicit nature of a request that I know was made very clear by the waitress when the salad was returned.   I get that people shrug their shoulders about food allergies, and think that people are making stuff up. That is an unfortunate mindset that really can harm people.",

Food was ok. Nothing special. Good location with small parking lot. I think if the interior of the place did not look like your in a hospital room, reduce the menu, replace the owner as chef, reopen under new management signs, offer specials, the place just might give the resturant across the street some competition. Otherwise, ????",

When I went to the restroom they had ONE table on the other side with 8 guests! Our food came our minutes later, inedible. Other guests entering after us waited just as long to be acknowledged and when they were they were told \"we can't take your order for 30 minutes\"....quite bizarre business model.
