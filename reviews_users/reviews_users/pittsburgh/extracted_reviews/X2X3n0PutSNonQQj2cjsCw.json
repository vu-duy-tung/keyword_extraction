    "text": "Came here to try out their pho. Also ordered an Vietnamese iced coffee to pair off with the food. The food itself wasn't bad. Broth was pretty consistent and tasted good. The pho itself came with a good amount of noodles and meats, too (Pho Dac Biet). Unfortunately, I could tell that the iced coffee was hastily prepared. The temperature consistency was just not there. When I initially started drinking it, I was surprised to find out that there was still an extremely warm layer of coffee at the bottom. Also, the service was rather slow. The slowest parts of service were the lag times I experienced while waiting to order and receiving my check afterwards (sat there for 20 minutes after I finished eating). I don't blame the waitress as she was the only one serving multiple tables at once, but the establishment really needs to take note that dinner hours tend to be much busier than the day. It'd probably be wise to hire at least one more person to help the poor solo waitress out.",

The setting is plain, but attractive with back lit, color changing wall panels.  The lunches are an especially good deal, with most dishes under $8.  So with all that good, what's the bad?  The service can be a little slow and there's nothing terribly distinctive about the place.  Everything was good, but nothing about the service, dishes, or decor is particularly memorable either.  That said, Squirrel Hill was in need of a quality Vietnamese pho house, and now thanks to Tan Lac Vien, they have  a worthy purveyor of fine pho!",

I also come from Southern California where there are entire counties bursting with Vietnamese immigrants opening restaurants. I came with my family and we ordered the bun, com, and pho. The bun and com had good flavor and the meats were seasoned well. However, the pho was disgusting. The broth was tasteless. It was like instant broth. Also, the noodles are completely wrong. They are way too thick. I came for pho, not some kind of wannabe udon. And why they advertise that they are also a Chinese, Japanese and Thai restaurant is beyond me. Clearly they could benefit from sticking to just one type of cuisine.",

    "text": "I've been to a few of the Vietnamese restaurants here in Pittsburgh and there is a consistent issue with the ethnic foods. The are usually lacking in flavor and that they don't provide the variety of ingredients (ie greens) that many ethnic Vietnamese dishes offer.   However, I had come here on two occasions with friends and was pleased on both ocassions. The first time I came I ordered the Bun Bo Nuong (rice vermicelli with grilled beef) the blend of sweet, salty and spicy from the nuoc mam (fish sauce) blended perfectly well with the ingredients in the bowl.   My next outing was a little more formal. We ordered the spring rolls w/ shrimp and the vegetarian papaya salad as appetizers and the were delicious. you couldn't even tell that the vegetarian ham was vegetarian at all with the texture and flavor. For my entree I ordered the Banh Hoi (woven rice vermicelli) with grilled beef. This came with rice paper that we would wrap in our own DIY spring roll. The assortment of greens that accompanied was great from cilantro, coriander, basil, and other fresh herbs. For desert we had vietnamese coffee and the sticky rice with durian. I'm we acquainted with durian and its smells, however the way that they made the dish, the smell is gone and instead you get the sweet taste of coconut and a hint of the tangy durian taste.   The waitress we had was very nice and informative that night and the owner even had a chance to come over and talk to us about the cuisines. It was a great dinner.  If this place sold Vietnamese sandwiches for lunch, I'd be here way more often. My next try is going to be the pho.",

The service was competent ,and the dishes were quickly brought to the table. It is reasonably priced ($10-12 for the pho).   The summer rolls were tasty and fresh. The soups were large, and we did not finish them. While the pho was good, the other soup (pork broth instead of beef broth as in the pho) with seafood was rather bland, which explains the 3 stars. The broth was simply not very tasty and the seafood did not add much to its flavor.   Still, I'll be back!",

    "text": "This place definitely fits into my ADD category of restaurants simply because each dish is really interesting and fun to eat. I don't have that much experience in the Vietnamese realm of food other than Pho,so this was a nice new experience for me me.  We came here for lunch and the special lady had told me that it can take a good amount (:25+) of time to get food here so we came here for lunch with that in mind. When we walked in we were promptly greeted and seated. The friendly staff had only us to attend to in this very small dining room so they were able to answer some of my questions in great detail which I can really appreciate.   For an appetizer we tried an order of the GOI CUON which is simply a fresh summer roll. What is a summer roll? well it is a neat little bundle of fresh veggies and shrimp, it said that it had pork belly in it but I wasn't tasting it which is fine with me for this tasty bundle. Itis wrapped in a rice paper wrapper that gives an appearance of being wrapped in an opaque plastic wrap that is edible. It had a really unique texture and combined with the veggies and shrimp it made for a great delivery device for an appetizer. This came with a large side of some sort of peanut based dipping sauce that I recommend trying, I think some people would be turned off by the sauces brown appearance but it is very good.  For our main dishes I tried something other than PHO, and it was definitely a neat little plate of stuff you can just mix together to your hearts content. It was almost like an adult happy meal for me. It was called COM TAM SUON BI OP LA, or you can call it CT2. I really enjoyed the runny egg that was also on the plate, and before you Pittsburghers get all excited about a runny egg, that I guess is common in a lot of asian dishes??? Who knew. I took a picture of it for yelp so you can take a look at it, it was all fresh and tasty but I thought what the special lady got was hands down one of the best noodle dishes I have had in a long time. It is called BUNG DAC VIET or the BV1. It was a very refreshing dish that I almost could stop sampling hers. Matter of fact after I horked down my dish I went to town on everything she didn't eat. This dish had noodles, salad, cucumber, shrimp, , tasted  like some mint and/or cilantro. But it was a great combo. Now one other thing was that these are pretty large dishes with fresh ingredients, so be prepared and have an appetite or be ready to bring some who with you.   It only took about 15 minutes to get our food so thats really good in my opinion for freshly prepared made to order food. And you may actually learn a thing or two or at least learn how to pronounce stuff on the menu.   Den kiem tra noi nay ra! That's vietnamese for, come check this place out!",

When we were seated (around 5:30), we were the only guests in the place. It was only my second go around with Vietnamese food, and since the menu had so many different types of dishes I'd never heard of I decided to trust her on her choices. Our waitress was extremely upbeat and friendly and was actually fantastic in her recommendations.  My buddy ordered a rice noodle dish with ham, sprouts, and other veggies that was light and tasty, esp when accompanied with the sauce. My dish was phenomenal with two big crepes filled with shrimp, sprouts, pork, and something else and was accompanied by a virtual field of greens, cucumbers, carrots, cilantro, and other healthy stuff! The dish was filling but not greasy which was a nice switch up from most Americanized asian food joints.  \rFor whatever reason I decided to get creme brulee at the end of my deal. What it lacked in texture, it made up for in creamy deliciousness. I was thoroughly pleased. I will definitely visit this place at non peak dining hours, because by the time we left tiny place was packed!",

The portions are huge, the options unlimited and everyone I was with was incredibly satisfied. I ordered the Pho Ga (chicken) and I could barely manage to eat half of it, it was massive (and only $10!). I love that you can add as many veggies (or as few) as you like - really altering the dishes to your preference right at the table.

I should have taken picture but unfortunately I only remember to complain but not save some evidence. They immediately took the bug away after seeing it. Guys, this place is not clean. Hope I will not get sick later tonight. Guys, honestly DO NOT GO. Again, DO NOT GO!!! ( alright they replace a new one to me. But if it not because I ask, they were trying to charge me with that one.  I mean at least they should apologize and not ask money for a replacement!!!)",

It has so much MSG that after the first spoon my tongue is numb. I am definitely going to have a massive headache tonight. I am used to $6.50 to $8.00 for a great bowl of pho. And that's in LA, where supposedly living cost is way more expensive than here in Pittsburgh. The lack of competition has driven the price up and quality down. I am thoroughly disappointed.  As for the service, I asked the waiter for a lime a few times which did not come.   I will not be coming here again.   And there it is the headache.",

(Yes, I know that Pad Thai is not Vietnamese, but she was adamant...)  The pho was good. The broth was hearty and well-seasoned, the chicken was tasty, and the noodles were tender. It came with fragrant fresh herbs. The portion was surprisingly large. I had enough left-overs for an entire second meal! I'm not an expert, but this pho hit the spot!  The broken rice was a disappointment. It was covered in some coating that did not look gluten-free. I hope it was gluten-free because I tried a little. It wasn't a big loss because it didn't taste good at all. We will not order this dish again.  Both my husband and my daughter enjoyed the Pad Thai, which contained a generous amount of chicken. Again, they give you an enormous portion that made a second meal for her as well!  Overall, we're looking forward to our next visit!",

This is a tiny place so I can imagine showing up and not getting a table.  The service was very good and the prices were ok for Squirrel Hill.  Maybe a little high for the cuisine.

    "text": "Stopped in for a very late lunch (4pm?) with my sister, and we both ordered Pho.  I got the Pho Tai Nam combo, which comes with rare and well-done eye round beef as well as flank.  The broth was very nice, we had a plethora of fresh accoutrements (jalapeno, thai basil, sprouts, lime wedges, etc.), and overall the Pho was quite tasty.  My only complaint is that I felt like it was light on the meat... I get at least 50% more beef in my Pho when I get the three-cut combo at Pho Van in the Strip.  We tried the sticky rice with durian dessert.  Durian is a southeast asian fruit that's kind of stinky in smell but has a rich nutty flavor in taste.  Some people find the smell fragrant, particularly if they've grown up having it routinely in Vietnamese cuisine, but I had a hard time getting used to the smell (to be fair, the waiter did warn us about this and had even offered to give us a sample before we ordered it...we only declined because we were in a rush).  Our service, however, was stellar.  We were constantly attended to, our waters were refilled almost instantaneously, and our server was super friendly and helpful.  He was particularly helpful towards the end of the meal when we were a bit rushed to avoid being late to our next event.  I definitely look forward to coming back here (it's a super convenient location if you live or work near CMU) to try some of the other dishes soon!",

Last night was different.  I called to inform them that my delivery order was incomplete.  First, they questioned whether I was telling the truth.  Then, I was told that they made the food and the delivery driver is to blame for not delivering the full order.  They told me that they were not responsible, that they would not deliver the item to my home (although I could pick it up), and they would not reimburse me.  When I challenged them, I was told that it was too bad, that they were busy, and was hung up on.   I get it -- you're busy.  But how much longer do you expect to be busy when you treat your customers this way?  I won't be returning and hope this makes others think twice, too.",

The radishes and carrots were not really pickled at all- it was lightly sweet, and was lacking the tangy crunch it's supposed to have.   The pepper tofu dish was something else- I do not recommend this dish. Just because you order vegetarian, doesn't mean that the food should be bland.

We called it \"Happy Mouth,\" because that's what you had when you left. I have been on a quest worthy of Shrek for 13 years. I found it.  Tan Lac Vien (translated as New Happy Place) is my new Happy Place. The meats are seasoned perfectly. Right combination of salt and sweet and vinegar and umami. The fish sauce is so appealing I can drink it.  Very nice sized portions, excellent balance of very fresh green herbs and lettuce. We are reeling in delight. They were out of beef, so we had pork. Good quality, not at all chewy. If they would have had beef, I think one of us would have Meg Ryan orgasmic-ed at the table.  We'll be back, multiple times, guaranteed. See you there!  Third time here. Green curry so salty it was inedible. I sent it back. Everything else here seasoned perfectly.",

First off pho and scallops are my 2 favorite foods and would not go back if my pho ga (chicken) was $3 not the $10 they charge.$12 for other pho makes this very high priced and I had to ask for peppers and got almost no basil ( first plate she brought was brown and looked days past serving. Almost no chicken (Shredded in strings I thought the forgot at first). Soup itself was good and noodles where soft so could have been better rating but 3 strikes here.  Waitress could not understand me but sweet. Got app wrong after pointing to menu for all selections. Not worth trying to straiten out so just paid for it. She took it away 2 spring rolls with 1 bite and never asked if I liked them.   To many other great place to go here.",

We had had a terrible experience before with the service and I'm pretty diligent and prompt about posting either rave or rough reviews.   The layout is a bit strange with a table segregated and close to the front door, but one deals with what they have the best they can.  Tasty vegetarian- friendly food. The veg Pho (Pho Chay) is delicious.  Service is either very slow and/or confused. We've waited for takeout 20 minutes longer than predicted only to walk home with someone else's order. We've dined in, only to have one of our meals arrive 15 minutes after the other, all while other tables are seated, served and have left. No apologies.   Good food, many times, requires a wait, that's understandable. I don't think this place is staffed appropriately. After 5 tries with some sort of service issue, I don't think the taste is enough to bring us back.",

The decor is minimalist but has glowing red lights - looks cool from the outside at night but strange once inside. The music was soft and pleasant, allowing easy conversation with your friends.   The vegetarian pho (pho chay) was good but not amazing, but hey, it's vegetarian and probably hard to make vegetable broth have a spectacular flavor. Mostly, it's great that I can suggest this place for decent food while satisfying my more carnivorous friends. My friend enjoyed his more meaty pho with the caveat that the amount of meat was much less than what you would except in California.  Also: 10% student discount with cash payment at writing time.",

The place could use an upgrade, however like most Squirrel Hill locations it's part of the restaurants character.    Service was fast and the prices on par with Pho in a Midwestern city. If I were passing by and in the mood for Pho, I'd stop again. I wouldn't make a special trip for the sole purpose of visiting Tan Lac Vien.",

    "text": "I was curious what the \"Pho-1-1\" was on Tan Lac, as I heard the musings of delicious Vietnamese food being told on yelp. I ventured out on a chilly friday night to the depths of squirrel hill, swallowed up by rows upon rows of charming old world decor houses and windy-hilly streets.  Tan Lac is situated near some other Asiatic cuisine houses, including the Green Pepper, which I am due to try out soon. Apparently, everyone else got the memo too, OR read my mind in one giant conspiracy...because there was a wait....after eight....I said \"isnt this great!\" all I wanted was a late plate with my mate for a date!  It turns out, there was a Post Gazette or something article a day before. After sitting on a cold windowsill throne of marble for the better part of forty some odd minutes, my cramped and cold buttocks was escorted to a table with my better looking partner in tow.   By now, our slavering appetites had guided our tongues towards selection, mouthing words of dishes while mentally consuming them with reckless abandon! The spring rolls-Devoured! Peanut sauce tangy sweet and spicy!  The pho arrives! Horns sound, peasants rejoice, banners of epicurean celebration abound! The broth is delicious and savory. After the initial sampling, I tinker with it as an alchemist, shiracha and duck sauce, carefully measured, tasting and musing over the balance of flavor. I was sated, filled, patting my stomach. My girlfriend, the same. Gluttons, we were not, but hungry, we were.   I would love to return and sample some more traditional vietnamese dishes. As for the four stars, it was very good, but lacked the distinction neccessary for five.",

They cooked up a mean vegetarian pho that was extremely flavorful, full of tofu and perfect once an appropriate amount of Sriracha sauce (which was brought out promptly, without me asking I might add) was added to the concoction.  The cheese wontons are also quite legit.  Do try them.    Service was fantastic as it was our first time.  Dining here is a very, very safe-bet if you're a fan of Chinese, Vietnamese or Thai.  Furthermore, we really appreciate their kitchen and wait staff serving us at 9:45 (15 minutes prior to close), and waiting for us before we were done.  They certainly did not have to do that, nor would I expect them to, but the fact that they did makes me want to recommend this place even more than I already would.",

I'm glad to say, Tan lac Vien doesn't take any shortcuts with their preparation.  The additions included a nice selection of the usual suspects, bean sprouts, cilantro, thai basil, and hot pepper, as well as culantro, which was an unexpected delight. Sriracha and Hoy Sin were also provided.  The service was fantastic, in no small part because the owner was working the front of the house, while her husband was in the kitchen. She seemed very nice and accommodating, and even though the menu indicates 'no substitutions' was glad to make changes when requested (to fit our dietary restrictions).   The restaurant itself is small, but don't be mistaken, there is additional seating available upstairs, (about another 30 seats).   Of the over 30 establishment's I've had Pho in, across five states, this was the best single bowl of Pho I've had.  I've only visited once (so far) but already I can't wait to go back.",

It is a bit of a hole in the wall, but that usually means the ownership is more concerned with quality and authenticity of food over decor. Not here apparently. The waitstaff was pleasant and attentive. I recommend looking elsewhere for Pho. Surely Pittsburgh has more to offer elsewhere.",

We've also tried their dry noodles and regular pho, both very good too. Portions here are very generous - we never need an appetizer to start, but would like to try some options some time.

    "text": "So overall, the food was awesome, I was just upset with their ability to keep things \"in stock.\"   I ordered hibachi steak and shrimp originally and the kind lady informed me they were out of steak. So I ordered the chicken and shrimp.   (Hibachi is known to come with the creamy shrimp sauce, and it said it did in the menu.)   Well, I receive my food and everything looks great, she then informs me they are out of creamy shrimp sauce...  I was so upset because that was the only reason I ordered the hibachi!  I was offered an alternative sauce that was good but not the same.   And I wasn't offered money off on my bill. That's what makes me upset overall.   Food still tasted great...I was just in a sour mood the whole time.",

The waitress who took our order was very knowledgeable not only about what was on the menu but also in knowing the names of the dish in Vietnamese.  I ordered a spring roll stuffed with ground pork and some Vietnamese spices with fish sauce which I found excellent and exotic tasting. For my entree I ordered crepes stuffed with bamboo shoots and some meat (I forget what kind). It was a decent dish but a bit too messy and difficult to eat. For dessert, I had the sticky rice with duri that I found out of this world. The duri, which was like a pudding with coconut, was excellent and not too sweet like typical desserts.  The service was excellent as the waitress was friendly and very thorough in describing the dishes not to mention providing recommendations, and the hostess was also very pleasant. My favorite dishes were the spring roll appetizer and the dessert. I'd like to come back to try their stews.",

The wait staff will recognize you and know your appetizer order if you come more then once a week ;-)  On a cold winter day the Pho will warm you right up. The broth is rich and tasty and the plate of veggies are super fresh.  The House special Bun vermicelli is my second favorite. A bowl of noodles but no broth, fresh veggies, spring roll, and choice of grilled protein all smothered in their house made fish sauce (which I've seen my boyfriend drink straight!) And then there's the Com Tam, broken rice dish...yum! The crispy spring rolls, fresh summer rolls, and steamed chicken dumplings are the best! And there's more than just Vietnamese food! They do a stellar all white meat General Tso's chicken, as well as Thai curry and Chinese noodle dishes. Oh and they have vegetarian and vegan options! Never had a bad meal and we'll keep going back for more!",

Pho broth to me should be aromatic.. the one here didn't have the herby, earthy aromas that pho usually has from the star anise, etc. It definitely wasn't plain, but just didn't feel it had any depth of flavor. According to my bf (viet guy) it was just added fish sauce.  The meatballs in my bowl were good, pho noodles were soft, and the portion was very generous. I liked the decor, the ambiance, quiet and good for conversation. A little steep in price for a bowl of pho (dac biet $13), so may or may not come back for a second try  Food: 2.5 Everything else about the dining experience: 4.5 Overall: 3",

Since it was such a cold day today, we were craving some pho and decided to give it another shot. Two and a half years ago I would've given it 2 stars but the food has gotten better and service was excellent. We had the crispy spring roll with seasoned pork, pork chops over broken rice and the pho special. They either have a new chef or changed their recipes because the food definitely tastes better than it did before. The pork chop and the fish sauce dipping sauce (nuco mam cham) was much more flavorful but I thought the pho was just average. My husband also occasionally stops by here to pick up some Vietnamese coffee to go and it's one of his favorites. The food's not the best we've ever had but I'm glad we have another go-to place for decent Vietnamese food since it's such a rarity in Pittsburgh.",

The bun bo hue was the biggest disappointment thou. I'm was looking for a restaurant that can make my all time favorite soup in each city that I go to. This one looked so good and the meats included were tasty and cooked correctly. BUT what was suppose to be a rich spicy heavenly broth...tasted more like a cube of chicken bouillon in hot water with some chili oil. Tasty, if you were looking for a spicy chicken noodle soup with pork stuff in it.   So sad. Oh well, my search will go on for a good Vietnamese restaurant I can adore.",

For my part, I welcomed her suggestion to visit, since it had been quite awhile since I'd last had pho.  We ordered cha gio (spring rolls) to split ($5), and we each ordered a lunch sized bowl of pho ga (chicken pho; $8).  The spring rolls came out within 5 min., and were quite good.  They were appropriately crispy on the outside, and flavorful and well-textured on the inside.  While they were great on their own, they came with an accompanying sauce that added some additional flavor and heat.  Both of us enjoyed them very much.  As for the pho, its broth was rich and savory, and stood quite well on its own, although I added some sriracha and hoisin to add some extra interest to the second half.  The proportion of noodles seemed about right, and the fresh herbs were a nice accompaniment that we both took advantage of.  It could just be my American palate, but the amount of chicken included seemed a bit stingy, though it was white meat.  Again, both of us enjoyed the pho, though both of us are far from being pho experts (this was her first time eating it and my second).  Overall, we were quite pleased with our experience at Tan La Vien.  The price seemed pretty reasonable, given the food quality and portion size, and we were able to get an additional 10% student discount, thanks to her (I no longer qualify, unfortunately). The setting and service were fine, as well, so no complaints there.  If you're hungry for a bowl of pho in SqHill, check this place out--it doesn't disappoint!",

The restaurant itself was pretty small, but has a nice feel to it when I first walked in. However, the waitress sat us at this table for two in this awkward narrow hallway near the entrance. Personally, I thought our waitress was kind of unfriendly and unprofessional.   I ordered \"Bun Bo Hue\". The portion was huge with a lot of meat. The broth was just right and the noodles weren't too soggy. The only downfall to this bowl of \"bun bo hue\" was that it lacked banana blossoms--a must have. Also, I thought it was a lot pricier comparing to all the other Vietnamese restaurants in Pittsburgh. It was good, but I don't think it is worth it for the price.  Overall, Tan Lac Vien lost a star for poor service, and another star for being overpriced.",

I got N5 (pho with beef, it's a soup), good portion size and fairly cheap price for dinner! $10  one spoonful, and said \"it's so good I could cry\" Then someone told the waitress that and she was like \"aww that's the best compliment anyone could ever give\" But seriously guys. It's so good. (Personally I despise cilantro, so none of that for me.) but yes. Their portions are huge but literally our whole table finished their bowls. I can't really describe the experience except for the fact that it was absolutely delicious and you all need to go",

    "text": "Yet another update for Tan Lac Vien, but only because my most recent visit was different enough from my last one to warrant another comment. It seems that they have their new menus in place now, which is a great replacement from what they had before. Lots of nice pictures which reinforce their relatively large selection in comparison to other Vietnamese places in the city.  I specifically ordered a grilled pork banh mi to go, which was not originally offered a while back. For $6, you get a fair-sized sandwich, probably smaller than what you'd find at Subway or Jimmy John's, but with a very different taste. All the standard ingredients of carrot, daikon, cucumber, cilantro, and jalepeno were included, along with the sauce that makes the sandwich taste distinctly Vietnamese. Adding to this medley of flavors was the perfectly grilled pork, which has been consistent across other dishes like the com tam and bun as well. There aren't that many banh mi places in Pittsburgh, but this is definitely a winner in my book.  The only small concern I could bring up is that there was a bit more sauce than is usually found in banh mi, so it was a bit messy with the sauce dripping out at the other end. But it wasn't overwhelming at all, so it's not a huge issue.",

If you answer yes to either of these questions, that means pho will solve your problems!   They've redone their menus to be more visual-- you're able to see all the different types of food. But of course I stuck with pho since question #2 was a yes. Big bowl of soup with hearty broth. This broth is probably one of the best in Pittsburgh-- tried the other places in the strip, and none live up to this. Generous portion of noodles, could have a bit more meat in it. Was way full after, barely had room for the bun I was splitting-- so we ended up taking that home.  For a CMU student... This might be a bit of a trek without a car-- but well worth it!

Visiting from NY, we took our daughter (who attends college here) and a few of her friends.  We had reservations for 7:30 but the people at the table they had intended for us were apparently lingering a LONG time.  So, while we had to wait close to 30 mins, the staff were very attentive, apologetic and nice; they managed to set up a special table for us and they also gave us complimentary desserts! The food here was very good - better than many places in NY - and it was casual but with a very warm ambience.  A few people had the soup (pho), which got good reviews, the steamed dumplings were excellent, and the bun that I had was very good.  It's refreshing (based on my experience in the Burgh) to find a place where you ask for the food spicy . . . and they actually make it spicy!  Good job.  The crepe dish was deep fried but very good and not overly greasy.  Interestingly, we had stopped by the evening before for take-out, and they said it would be an hour wait - seriously? for take-out??  A place like this would never survive in NYC, but hopefully it will here because it is a real gem! Just goes to show - if you serve great food and are good natured, people will be very forgiving of miscues.  I am sure we will be back!",

    "text": "Ambiance: Somewhat small space with only 5-6 tables, seats maybe 20 people. They place tries to take on a modern spin with decorative wall panels and bold colors but the yellow paint and plentiful scuffs on the walls kind of make this place feel a little run down. This was compounded by them seating us next to a door with chipped paint and a removed doorknob like a ghetto closet. It was not reassuring to see no vietnamese on the menu and our server didn't speak vietnamese. He was friendly but was also one-track minded and tunnel-visioned so it was hard to get his attention. Even when looking around, he failed to note when glasses were empty or when meals were close to being done (so he can prep a check).   Food: We started with summer rolls which were small but tasty, most places I go to serve 3 half-shrimp per roll instead of 2. The rice wrapper wasn't chewy though and the peanut sauce was savory with a slight kick. For the main, I had the pho special which was good but odd. Authentic pho is really just a simple beef broth which should be rich, savory, and salty with a pick-your-own-adventure of herbal components. While the broth here was savory, it was not quite concentrated enough to be called rich. The odd part is that they add anise, cinnamon, and other spices that unnecessarily complicate a normally humble dish, let the beef broth shine on its own! Portion-wise, the dish was fine although I grew up in San Diego where you can get pho for literally half the price they charge here. My wife had the grilled pork broken rice which was OK although the fish sauce was notably weak/dilute.  Raised by vietnam-born chinese parents in california and having visited vietnam, I can honestly say this is NOT authentic and over-priced. The food is fine and tasty but I'd recommend exploring other places first if you're looking for a True vietnamese experience.",

There were only 1 or 2 other tables for Sunday lunch around noon, and our party of 4 was seated quickly, but the place had definitely filled up by the time we left.  I ordered the PHO CHAY, while the rest of my table had the house special PHO DAC BIET, the PHO TAI, and the GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN.  I had wanted to try a couple of different things for my first visit using the lunch menu, since it was great that it was available even on a Sunday, but the options were pretty limited--no stir-fries that were Vietnamese style and not a lot of vegetarian options.  Oh well.  I was not in the least disappointed with my vegetarian pho.  It came with plenty of vegetables, and the broth tasted DELICIOUS and very naturally sweet.  I was super impressed with the depth of flavor that they were able to create in a vegetable broth.  In fact, I tried my fiance's beef/tripe broth and actually preferred mine.  We both enjoyed the hell out of our dishes and would definitely repeat.  Our friends, who weren't first-timers here, really liked their food as well.    Our table was provided a shared plate of the usual garnishes--basil, cilantro, sliced jalapenos, lime wedges, a heaping pile of mung bean sprouts, and culantro, which I've actually never tried before.  Perhaps the prices were a little steep for pho, as others have said, but the portions were so generous that all 3 of us who ordered pho all had significant leftovers.  We received our food fairly quickly, but service was a bit spotty throughout, which was the one subpar area of our experience.  Perhaps it was simply due to the arrival of the lunch rush, but our meal was checked on an excessive number of times in the first few minutes after we received our food, but we had trouble getting the check by the end, even after actively asking for it.  Our server also made it a point to tell us while we were ordering that they didn't have bubble tea--even though none of us mentioned it?  Um...okay?  She also failed to tell me that the tofu in my pho would be fried, which I'm not a fan of and had pointedly asked about.  \"It's soft and fluffy tofu,\" she had told me.  It wasn't.  It was firm, pressed, and fried.  Next.  I know I sound super picky, BUT inconsistent service will never dissuade me from a tasty meal.  I'll be making my rounds to try other Vietnamese joints in Pittsburgh, but I'll definitely be back, Tan Lac Vien.  In the meantime, the owners might want to consider updating their online menu--it's pretty different from the one I was shown in the restaurant, especially for the section for us Veggies.  Just a thought.",

It's very small with a dungeon feel. I felt like I was in a secret restaurant underground. It was small but that doesn't bother me. It's a nice little place. The guy who seated us was very nice and gave me literally a minute to look at the menu.  I was surprised how much they charged for pho. It's just broth noodles and meat, right? I was thinking, if I'm paying that much it better be the best pho I ever had!   Started off with the crispy spring rolls. It was fried perfectly! Golden brown and not burnt. And the dipping sauce was very tasty.  The pho came out momentarily. Big bowl, lots of noodles, and meat. For me, pho is all about the broth! Unfortunately, it lacked flavor. I was underwhelmed and while the broth looked yummy it lacked that broth-y star anise flavor that I was looking for. I lightly doctored up the soup to give it some flavor with some hoisin sauce. Not a fan of the rare beef cut because it had a slight \"dirt\" taste to it.   Although the pho lacked flavor, I wouldn't say it is bad. It's good but not the best I've ever had. I would definitely return and recommend it to people who are in the area.",

    "text": "I was apprehensive about trying this place out after seeing the ridiculous prices for pho. They charge $13 for the special (dac biet) while other places charge around $9-$10. Yes, those few dollars do matter to me. But let me tell you, those few dollars are so worth it because Tan Lac Vien has the best bowl of pho you'll find in Pittsburgh!  My husband and I came here on a whim on a bitter cold day, figuring pho would warm us up. What I really like about this place is that it has a rather large Vietnamese menu, not just pho, although I couldn't bring myself to try anything else when the weather outside was in the single digits. We ordered the veggie spring rolls, and pho for each of us. The spring rolls came out on a large plate atop a variety of veggies (lettuce, cucumber, carrot, cilantro and basil), which can be used to roll up your rolls in, despite it looking like garnish. I really like that they serve it up with these veggies because it reminds me of how my mom serves her spring rolls: with a plate of greens for wrapping. Taste-wise, they were good but I would much prefer the full flavor from the pork spring rolls. But for $5 for two pork spring rolls, that's a bit steep when you only get about 2-3 bites out of one. And for the star of the show, the pho was the closest to my mom's I've ever had. The portion was large, the broth was clear and aromatic, and it didn't make me super thirsty afterwards (=little to no MSG, yay!). The meat wasn't as plentiful as I would like but it was enough to fill me, so no complaints.  The space is rather small, and the layout is a bit strange with two tables in the front of the restaurant and more tables in the back. Service was very good as several waitresses came by to assist us, without ever repeating questions. It's like they all talked to each other and knew what was taken care of and what was not. Overall, I really enjoyed Tan Lac Vien and I would definitely like to come back to try the other menu items!",

But the daughter of the owner (I think), came out personally with an order of crispy spring rolls w pork and apologized for the mix up. She assured us that our veggie rolls were on their way, but she wanted to make sure we had something to eat. Who does that? Anyway, holy delicious. I'm so happy they accidentally goofed our order because those pork spring rolls were out of this world. So, in summary, go here. The food is killer, atmosphere is wonderful, and the staff is so nice.

It used to be an Italian restaurant.  The decor is hip and not over stated. The vibe is relaxed. We started with the summer rolls that were super fresh with shrimp and tofu inside. The chili sauce was tangy and delicious. The rolls were extremely fresh prepared with the finest ingredients. We then ordered the tofu lemongrass. The waitress told us it was her Mother's traditional recipe. I have had this dish where the tofu is sauteed and then the lemongrass is like a sauce that is poured on top. This dish, however, had the tofu marinated in the lemongrass and then cooked with the sauce on it... Sooo amazing! It made the tofu crispy on the outside with the lemongrass flavor just penetrating through each bite! Fantastic. I ordered the pho chicken. The best I have had in Pittsburgh happened today, with the amazing pho I was served. The broth is so rich with flavor, the rice noodles were ala dente and the plate of bean sprouts, fresh herbs, limes, and jalapenos were awesome! There were fresh herbs on the plate along with the Thai basil and cilantro that I didn't recognize. The waitress explained that these were herbs from Vietnam that were similar to cilantro but authentic to exactly how it would be served in her hometown. I was blown away at the flavor these herbs added! Just amazing! I can't wait to go back and take my mother in law, who lived in Hanoi for three years. If you love pho you must try this place Tan lac Vien.",

    "text": "Great Vietnamese food! My boyfriend stopped here for a quick lunch. We walked here from a distance, so we were thankful to be seated right away.  We ordered summer rolls, dumplings, and each got a bowl of pho. I ordered the vegan pho and my boyfriend got beef pho.  They actually have a separate vegan menu which is awesome! Sometimes pho can have broth that isn't vegan, but I was assured by the menu that my meal would definitely be vegan.  Of course we got all of the toppings and herbs for our pho as well. Everything was extremely fresh and delicious.  The service was quick and friendly. The restaurant was generally clean, but the floors were a little sticky.  Overall a solid choice for pho.",

The name apparently means \"Happy Place\", and the menu has a lovely greeting, wishing that this restaurant becomes a happy place for you :)  I really liked that the back of their menu has an entire vegan section! I think Vietnamese food is not one of my favorite cuisines: I tend to find it a little bland, maybe because I stick to vegetable dishes. Nevertheless, the food here was well presented and very fresh tasting  One low point, we were sort of forgotten about after our food was served. This was kind of a good thing, since my friend and I spent a while catching up before seeking someone to get the check, but if we had been in a hurry it would have been a problem",

Service was good and quick to get our food.  My brother in law's girlfriend ordered one of their Lettuce Wraps.  It was very interesting.  It was kind of a deconstructed lettuce wrap.  It was on a big plate and she had a full platter of things to put on it.  My wife and I said we have to try that next time that we come here.  Our rolls were good but they weren't best that we have had.  We have had better.  My Pho was really good.  It had everything that I love about Pho and it kept me warm and made me full.  I think this is a decent place for Pho and other Vietnamese dishes.  Very good prices and it's BYOB.  One of the best in the burgh I think.",

There's plenty of seating both down stairs and upstairs although they typically reserve upstairs for larger parties. The place is casual, good for dates or groups. Their menu has a good amount of options, offering noodle soups (6 or 7 pho options), noodles w/no broth, rice dishes, lettuce wraps, and vegan options.   The pho is tasty and a huge portion. I like the N1; it comes with all types of meat: rare beef, tendon, tripe, flank, and meatball. I recently tried the bun special: lemongrass marinated pork and grilled shrimp w/ vermicelli noodles, salad, and a crispy pork roll. I would order it again. It's flavorful and comes with so much! The food came out pretty quickly too. I look forward to trying other options there such as the banh hoi (vermicelli lettuce wraps)",

However, because this is Pittsburgh where there are literally only 3 other viable options, Tan Lac Vien would be considered in the middle of the pack for the reasons below.  Pros: - Restaurant is run by Vietnamese-speaking staff - Fresh veggies are fresh (sprouts, basil, jalepenos) - They have chrysanthemum tea  Cons: - Having to literally wait 30 minutes for food because they are so understaffed. I really felt sorry for the one waiter who had to seat guests, take orders, serve the food, deliver the checks, and clean tables. The owners need to enlist more help! - Broth doesn't have the beefy richness that I expect when eating pho - Space feels slightly stuffy  Don't get me wrong, I really love pho and will definitely come back. I just really hope they have more than one waiter next time.",

We walked in to Tan Lac Vien at about 2:20pm when they were about to close at 3 pm - oops! We were one of those customers - sorry!   I ordered the vegan pho but I didn't want tofu, I wanted chicken. The Waitress was more than able to accommodate that. My husband also got pho, but with egg noodles. My dad got one of those bowls with no broth and my step mom ordered fried rice.   The fried rice was hella good. I really liked the bean sprouts in it. My dads bowl was good, it had shrimp and I liked the crunchy texture of it. My pho was good, despite the broth which tasted sort of how a dirty sock smells :\\ I never tried the egg noddles before , but I really liked them in my husbands pho.  Oh!! We also ordered fried egg rolls and fresh spring rolls. I didn't try the fresh ones which are my favorite but I did love the fried ones.   They didn't have hot chili oil on the tables nor did they bring anything like that out with the order which was kind of a bummer. I did ask the waitress and she brought something similar like that out   Maybe we came at a bad time or maybe their broth just isn't their strong point. Maybe it was Payback for coming in before closing.   I don't visit Pittsburgh often, I may or may not be back.",

I wasn't on Yelp at that time, so I may have ordered something wrong. What a mistake!   But this time around, I was using the full potential of Yelp reviews. Given the high rating, I decided to give the place another try. For the appetizer, I tried the fried dumplings. For the main course, I got the Bun Vermicelli Honey Chicken. It is a bowl of Vermicelli noodles, topped with some delicious chicken pieces, some leafy veggies, and a dressing. It has a tangy flavor to it, which goes really well.   One star less because I wasn't very thrilled with their service. We were a group of 10, so it may have been hard to wait on us, but towards the end there weren't too many other diners. It took a long time to bring us the check, and then they messed up the billing.   Otherwise, the food was great. And the location is perfect, bang on Murray, where all the fun is. Definitely worth a shot.",

I would say the broth here is pretty average - there is a satisfactory amount of beefy flavor and the ginger and onion tastes can be appreciated in the broth. However, I think the broth could be a little heavier and less sweet.   I was also displeased with the freshness of the herbs that came with the pho. The sprouts weren't white and the basil leaves had some dark patches.    Nevertheless, they do make good quality pho here and I find that rather impressive considering the relative lack of Vietnamese restaurants in Pittsburgh.",

They feature a large variety of vegetarian/vegan entrees so I was not short on options. The vegan bun was one of the best dishes I've had at a Vietnamese restaurant! Yes, really! The portions were excellent plus, the vegetables tasted fresh and the seitan was delicious. You also get a vegetable spring roll which added a nice crunch to the dish. I loooved the vegan fish sauce (at least I'm hoping it was vegan). It added a little saltiness with some spice and actually tasted like the real deal! I was like a ravenous lion attacking my meal like it was a helpless gazelle (a.k.a. it was not a pretty sight).   Three major downfalls of Tan Lac Vien: service, cleanliness, and price. It took our waitress 10 minutes to \"set the table\" before we could get seated - and by set the table, I mean put down a napkin. She seemed to be the only waitress in the entire restaurant so service was very slow. When we asked for sauces or refills, she would just completely forget and never return. The restaurant itself is small and cramped, but the real issue is how dirty it is. Nothing gets your appetite going like dust and bugs, am I right? Lastly, although the prices are not completely unreasonable, they are a bit higher than all the other Vietnamese restaurants in the area.   Since the noodles were so good, I didn't have the heart to knock off more than one star for the pitfalls. What can I say, my brain is controlled by my stomach. No question - this is my new go-to Viet restaurant in Pittsburgh!",

They clearly have the process down for that.  Love that they provided an abundance of fresh herbs to season, really makes all the difference.  Will be back.  Had a formidable feast for for under 40, so I don't know what the reviews of this placing being overpriced was about.  The small plates were plenty of food to try and completely reasonable.

The restaurant seats roughly 30-40 and was mostly filled when we came for lunch on a Tuesday afternoon. While they are categorized as a Vietnamese establishment on Yelp, the restaurant menu also offers Chinese, Thai and Japanese - and one can definitely taste that the sauces from the various cuisines are mixed together across dishes, making for less authentic tasting dishes - which are all still very good.  My Vietnamese Bun Thit Nuong (BV1) while very good was a bit reminiscent of take-out Thai (perhaps they used sweet thai chili sauce instead of sambal oelek for spice).  The egg rolls were tasty and crispy; however they were heavy on the pork and had chunky mushroom bits, and were not authentically Vietnamese, though they might have been Vietnamese-inspired. The pho broth on the other hand was very well developed (I could tell they had not taken any shortcuts) - the same goes for the seafood hu tieu (N10) broth.  The food here was good and I am glad to see Vietnamese offerings done this way in Pittsburgh, and would not hesitate to come back.",

I haven't eaten at Tram's Kitchen recently enough to make a solid comparison, but I think this pho was probably on par with Tram's or [very slightly] worse.  The highlight of the meal was the Vietnamese coffee, which is brought to the table in a cup-sized percolator; and is very nicely balanced flavor-wise. Sweet, spicy, and rich without being overly so. I had some hot and some over ice and really enjoyed it both ways.  I, for one, welcome the noodle renaissance that we're going through in Squirell Hill.",

The summer rolls, on the other hand, were not so good (no cucumbers, no crunch or spice at all to them, and they did not taste so fresh). So minus one star for that.

The proportions are fairly large and the pho broth is very hearty and very filling! The prices are fair too.   As for the menu, I always get pho so I can't testify to any of the other items on the menu. Although, I have tried a bit of their spring rolls, which by the way, are more like Chinese fried egg rolls rather than in the sticky rice paper that you would ordinarily see.  One of the times I came here, I distinctly remember that my server was new and had very inadequate knowledge of the menu and basic etiquette, and it was actually pretty distracting. Otherwise, their service is okay. Nothing spectacular, but they get the job done.  For parking, it's all street parking since the restaurant is right on Murray ave., so just a fair warning if you are supposed to meet someone by a certain time.  Overall, I think it's good.

The inside of this place is actually quite small and sits maybe about 30 people or so in the main dining area when full.  There aren't too many decorations so to speak of with wooden tables, blank chairs, some up-lighting and then a TV that was showing portions of the menu but got \"stuck\" while we were there.  This last time that I was there my fiance and I ended up splitting an order of Goi Cuon which is a summer roll with shrimp and pork belly.  Then for my entree I had the con tam bo nuong bi op la which was the broken rice with beef, shredded pork and a fried egg while my fiance went with some shrimp pho.  The summer roll came out first with a sort of sweet and sour sauce and looked really good.  You could actually see the large shrimp through the fairly transparent roll.  It tasted really good too as it was nice and light and paired perfectly with the sweet and spicy sauce.  The only part of it that I didn't really care for was the pork belly but I didn't think that it really affected the flavor at all.  After we finished our appetizer the entrees were delivered.  While my meal was not exactly what I was expecting, it ended up being really good.  The beef was my favorite part of the dish and had some really good flavor.  I also enjoyed breaking the fried egg over the rice to give the rice some richness. My only complaint about our whole time here was the slowness in service.  The place was completely full and it took awhile for us to get both waited on and then for us to pay our bill.  The bottom line for me is that I will be back here again in the future.  While the service was slower than I would have liked, my fiance and I both enjoyed the food that we got.",

    "text": "Pho is my favorite food, and having lived in Pittsburgh for 3 years, Tan Lac Vien is my favorite place to go for pho. Prices aren't amazing, but they aren't exorbitant either. I usually just get the rare beef pho, although I have gotten it with tripe in the past too. I have never gotten anything besides pho at Tan Lac Vien for fear of terrible food regret, but when I went for my 24th birthday, one of my friends got one of the broken rice dishes and liked it a lot. I have also tried a couple of their spring rolls, and they are good too, although lacking the peanut sauce I'm used to from pho places in NJ and NY.   My roommate also likes to get the cheese wontons, but this is the point in the review where I have to mention that service at Tan Lac Vien seems to have gone downhill a bit in the past year or so. My roommate has complained about being told differing things about the cheese wontons either no longer being on the menu or temporarily being unavailable (as of now you can still get it), and a few times she ordered it and they didn't say anything, but then she had to wait exorbitant amounts of time for her takeout order. I've also noticed some changes when dining in. When I went before, the owner, a super friendly young woman, would often come and talk to me. She seemed eager to talk about the dishes on the menu and tell me about which ones were more traditional, and she was ultra accommodating in letting me try different sauces for the spring rolls. I haven't seen her in a while, and service at Tan Lac Vien seems to have gotten worse in recent times. The last time I went there, the server was very...brusque. No smiles, a very blunt/curt response to my question about whether they had bubble tea (it was on the menu but they don't have it). I didn't mind much, as she was prompt about refilling water and the food came out fast, but just a note.   TLDR: Best pho in Pittsburgh. Okay prices. Service has been better in the past but still gets the job done.",

Stay away from the dumplings as they are obviously previously frozen. Ours came cold in the middle.  We also split the chef's special crapes, which were fresh, unusual, but very tasty! They were surprisingly busy for a Monday, but we got seated quickly and the food did not take a long time at all. This place is BYOB. Wish would have known ahead of time.  Will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "I've been eating at Tan Lac Vien for quite some time now and I can say that I have never left disappointed.  The meals are delicious, flavorful, varied, unique, well-portioned fairly-priced, and have never left me questioning whether or not what I am eating is the meat it was advertised to be.  The ingredients are quality.  Now, despite how many times I've been here, I've never felt tempted to try the General Tso's. Why would I get the stereotypical American dish when there is so much more to choose from?  Well, one night, my dad, a friend and I came here and one of the waitresses recommended that the friend try the general tso's tofu.  My.God.  It is hands down the most delicious General Tso's I have ever tried! Fast forward to today, and I finally gave in.  I ordered the General Tso's with Chicken and Brocolli.. It was amazing!  The chicken was actually chicken, thick, cubed cuts of, if I could italicize, lightly breaded chicken breast chunks tossed in a homemade sauce that has a wonderful smoky flavor to it from what I imagine to be the chili peppers in it.  Needless to say, this was magnitudes of order better than any General Tso's I've had anywhere-- you know, that crap that is like an inch thick of breading with chicken by-products.  Anyway, to my list of favorites:   Com Tom Ga: Broken rice, chicken, veggies, an egg, and fish sauce Bun Ga: a noodle dish various seafood dishes  I can now add the General Tso's.  Also, the entire staff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Don't be afraid to go in and ask them for suggestions-- they are good a making them, and moreover, don't be afraid of asking how to eat certain things, because sometimes it can be confusing, and yes, there are intended ways of eating some of the dishes.",

It took a very long time to get our tea and appetizers.  And when the main dishes finally arrived, the waitstaff was very confused as to which dishes were what and in fact, some of them were incorrect.    Additionally, the timing was off (i.e. main dishes served at different times, and appetizers served with mains).  Having enjoyed several quality Vietnamese meals, the fact that the best dish on the table was a Chinese dish is problematic.  All of the main dishes in my party lacked flavor.  Finally, the establishment had an unappetizing odor, which detracted from our dining experience.  Our waitress did not even thank us at the end of the night, which really should just go without saying.",

One of them was pretty good and nice. The other one, is really rude! I asked for a small plate for sauce dipping. She stared at me and said very loudly: \"What?! You have one plate right there!\" I'm new to the city and I'm not sure how this restaurant is still open with this type of service. Later on, I heard another table appeared to be asking for something, and this waitress literally responded with: \"For what?!\" I was very shocked.   The iced water we asked for has definitely no ice and has room temperature.   I will not visit this place again.",

    "text": "Though I am Chinese, my parents were both born and raised in Vietnam, and only left because of the war. At home, I ate Vietnamese way more than Chinese food, and grew up in Boston, where the Vietnamese population is huge, and the bar for food is high. Moving to Pittsburgh, one of my first missions was to make sure I could get a good bowl of pho (fyi: \"pho\" sounds like \"fuh,\" not like \"foe\")--my grandmother always taught me that you can judge the caliber of a Vietnamese place by the quality of their pho broth.   The pho broth here was clear and sweet, in that rich savory way that bone broth that has been stewed for hours and hours should be, not the salty hit that you get with boullion/msg-based soups. The noodles were silky and the right amount of thickness. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  My mom, who was with me at the time, had a bowl of their bun bo hue (a little spicy, a lot delicious, for those of you out there who are a little more adventurous when it comes to Asian food), and gave it 4/5 stars when I asked her about flavor and authenticity. It came with the authentic herb pairing on the side (each different Vietnamese noodle soup has a specific combination of herbs that it should come with--pho herbs are different from bun bo hue herbs. Use them by shredding them into your soup while its still hot for the most authentic flavor). My mom really liked that they serve their soups piping hot because she hates lukewarm noodle soup more than anything else. Now that this place has passed my pho test, I'll definitely be coming back here for bun bo hue and other noodle soups in the future!  Definitely recommend.   (p.s. It's not a super fancy or large place, but I don't really trust any Vietnamese place that puts on airs anyway.)",

It's missing the feeling of a traditional Vietnamese restaurant.  Maybe because they try to serve Chinese food too.  Maybe because I feel crammed next to other diners in a small back room with 10 other tables.  Maybe because the dishes were skimpy on the meat.    One dinner here including 1 bun, 1 pho, 1 spring roll, 1 sprite, tax, and tip got us almost up to 40 dollars!  It does complete the nice array of Asian food restaurants in Squirrel Hill and it may be good for a Vietnamese food newbie because the waiters will explain what everything is.

    "text": "I went with a group of 5 and the servers were really nice and helpful. I appreciated the fact that they didn't give us any trouble when we wanted to split the check. They were also able to recommend some dishes when we asked. Three people got pho and said it was good but not anything mind-blowing. One person got fried rice and said it was ok. I got the vermicelli noodles (not in soup) with grilled shrimp, pork, and egg roll. It was also ok. (I didn't particularly like the basil flavor that was in the dish and the pork was a bit too fatty.) Everyone agreed they would give this place 3 1/2 stars, but Yelp doesn't do that.  To be honest, I was shocked at how expensive the dishes were. My dish was $13. It was a large bowl, but usually Vietnamese food isn't that pricey. The restaurant wasn't a particularly classy restaurant (at the time that I went, they had two buckets in the entryway catching what I suppose is water dripping from the ceiling). The menus were laminated and the napkins were just paper napkins. As someone coming from NYC and used to some pricey meals, I think the cost of a meal here is a bit high for the food that they're serving and the ambiance that they present. Hope that doesn't sound snobby, but I don't think it's worth going back.",

    "text": "I am so glad I finally tried this little Vietnemese restaurant in my neighborhood.  I loved the pho, the bun, and the summer rolls.  They also had a secret banh mi sandwich menu when I was last there though I think they added it to their main menu now.  The banh mi was also excellent and a great lunch option.  I went twice over a two month period and the girl recognized me and remembered what I ordered even though weeks had passed!  She was quite friendly and made it a welcoming experience.  The food is some of the best vietnemese I've had in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "This was the first time I ever tried vietnamese food and the food was amazing. I told the lady attending to me that we were first timers and she was patient with us and explained to us how a dish would be served. We tried their salad rolls with shrimp, salad and cheese wontons. The highlight of the meal were the salad rolls which came with fresh herbs and you get to prepare it urself using a rice paper which was really very interesting.  The serving size is also huge so it's great value for money.  the only problem with the restaurant is it's not really fancy and indeed the furniture looks even cheaper to sit on. I am a student and don't mind the ambience at all until my taste buds are satisfied. Would definitely recommend this to anyone.",

All of the ingredients were superb and fresh, and the vegetable broth was quite deliciously flavored. It really hit the spot on such a cold day.  Interior decor was pleasant, a bit modern but not tacky. The server we had was very helpful in selections and was very friendly. I'll definitely come back to try more of their menu items.",
