    "text": "My husband and I made reservations a week in advance and were looking forward to Muddy Waters. We arrived and were seated promptly at a tall top table across from the bar. While the restaurant is narrow, we weren't bothered by the size. We did notice the table to be slightly wobbly.   After receiving oysters to start, the small table was pretty full. My husband accidentally knocked his 3/4 full cocktail off the table. The hostess noticed and grabbed an extra napkin. She walked away - we assumed she was getting more napkins - but she didn't come back to us the rest of the evening. When a restaurant is considered $$$, it seems like someone in the staff would help clean a spilled drink and at least offer to get a new one. Neither happened. (We don't mind the expense of a new drink, mainly frustrated with lack of help cleaning)  The service was subpar. Our waiter checked in very periodically. I ordered a cocktail at first with plans to switch to wine and never ordered a glass, as the waiter did not come back in time.   We decided we will not be back. Not impressed with the pricing or lack of service. I will be the first to say the gumbo was great and oysters were good.",

I had the shrimp po boy... And New Orleans staple.  It was ok.  We had some cocktails... They were ok.   You getting my drift here.

For drinks my sister and I ordered the French 75 and the Sippin summer porch or something like that...sorry I had a few and cant remember, but it had fresh watermelon juice and rum and lime and St Germain in it and was the perfect summer drink, refreshing and not too sweet. For dinner we split the Seafood Gumbo and the Shrimp and Grits. The Gumbo was good until I tried the shrimp and grits and that was all I wanted to eat. Yes you have to peel the shrimp but this dish had such great flavors that it was worth getting youre hands a little messy, BTW they give you hand towelettes. The Grits are buttery and creamy and the andouille sausage was smoky and just a nice texture, there was some kind of brown Cajun gravy on top of the grits as well as some pickled coleslaw, I think. You cannot lose with this dish, it is rich and packed with great flavors and textures. I would like to go back to try other dishes, as everything they were bringing out of the kitchen looked great, For dessert we had the Beignets with a thick dark chocolate bourbon infused sauce. My sister went nuts for this but although I liked them, I would like to try something else the next time we go back. I am glad Pgh has upped theyre game with this unique resteraunt with great food and service.",

This restaurant takes you away from the Pittsburgh city life and gives you a comfortable southern vibe with the awesome ambiance and live music along with the best raw bar EVER! The service was awesome and the drinks and food couldn't have been better. We went here for my roommates 23rd bday and spent good times with good food and champagne.   We ordered the pimento dip, hush puppies, and foie Gras deviled eggs for appetizers. Usually you don't see deviled eggs on a menu but when I tell you these are the best deviled eggs you'll ever eat, take my word. A..ma...zing!!!!! For our entrees we ordered mac and cheese, alligator po boy, and lobster roll. Zero complaints, well done!",

YES!  Finally!  I've tried so many things on the menu - Oysters (of course), Fried Green Tomatoes, Oysters Rockefeller, Deviled Eggs, hushpuppies, salmon \"corndogs\", beignets and so much other yumminess.  Every time I visit - it seems like it gets better and better.  I've been lucky enough to do the \"chefs Platter\" - where you try 2 of every oyster available.  I've found that I am an \"east coast\" oyster fan more so than a west coast.  The next time I visited - knowing this - we were lucky to be there for happy hour.  While you can try east coast ($1) and west coast ($2) you must order 6/type.  So - naturally we got 6 of each.    They have a great drink selection as well.  I ordered the \"I mississippi you\" just cause i liked the name - turns out it was a GREAT drink too!  Has jalapeno in it - and was spicy perfection!  I recommend heading to Muddy Waters if you are a oyster fan.  They have quite a bit on the menu if you aren't - but it's an oyster bar!  That's what they are known for! Definitely a fantastic happy hour location!",

Would definitely recommend a reservation as this is a small space.   Since it was the Friday before Fat Tuesday we went all in with oysters, lobster roll, and their special that night a cajun crawfish boil. My husband, who has been to New Orleans said it was the most authentic food he's had in Pittsburgh. And, while I've never been to the Big Easy, I will say the oysters were the freshest I've ever had this far in-land.  Yeah Muddy Waters is the real deal, but definitely make a reservation. Also, our waiter was super nice and an excellent server.   Oh, this is not a place for small kids. There's no changing table in the bathroom, a new mom I'm always on the lookout for changing tables.",

Everything I ate here seemed like it was cooked in.... how do I say this.... \"Muddy Waters.\"  I went to New Orleans and I like seafood and saw some cool food on the menu. I tried a grilled oyster with butter and crumbs. It was cooked right melted in my mouth like butter but the flavor was not what I like.  I ordered the alligator gumbo to be daring and the flavoring was off and not what I  like.  I ordered the Louisiana lobster and crayfish roll. It tasted fishy and not to my liking.  I think everything was made well and my service was good but the flavorings were not to my liking even though I think it's supposed to taste that way.... just not for me I guess.",

Not just friendly but knowledgeable, professional and clearly vested in what they're doing. 2) Great drinks, excellent beer list 3) Phenomenal classic NO / southern food with a not too heretical contemporary twist. So f'ing good. The oysters are bomb, great selection, super fresh, reasonable prices. The wedge salad with smoked blue cheese is off the hook it's not even funny. The alligator and sausage gumbo, forget about it, you're done, put a fork in ya. The po boys looked amazing, huge and the cajun fries are real deal. Killer happy hour (I missed it by a few but they priced my first beer and app at HR price without even mentioning it), with a late night HR as well. I could go on and on, could eat here every night, there's something for everyone. Don't be shy, don't be a foo, check it out!",

We did a complete sample of the menu minue dessert. The cocktail I order was absolutely delicious. It was the horse and donkey and like the server said it was sweet and smokey. We indulged in a sample of the various oysters and they were so fresh. Definitely want to go back and try more.  As for as our course order we ordered, a cup of gumbo. The gator and sausage was so tasty, the soup itself was very flavorful and was perfect with the rice. The fried green tomatoes and sauce was amazing. The tomatoes are slices were perfect and the sauce they serve it with was yummy.  We split a whole fried fish which was snapper. The presentation alone was great. But the fish was fried to perfection and it was served over cheddar grits and greens. As a person who knows good grits and greens these were made to perfection. I would come back just to eat a bowl of greens.  Overall muddy waters is doing a fantastic job. I recommend this place for any occasion.",

Enter Muddy Waters.  I have never liked raw oysters - something about the texture does not agree with my palette. I was outvoted, and to the oyster bar we went. We walked in and were seated right away (which, for a rough morning, was satisfying to say the least). We had instant access to the Bloody Mary bar, which was fantastic and offered many options to create a drink that could serve as a meal.  The table ordered a dozen oysters, and I went ahead and dove in. While I didn't have an awful experience, I wouldn't eat an oyster again - still not for me. However, everyone in my group LOVED them - so much that they ordered more.  Now, for the meal. I'm convinced my shrimp po boy was sent from heaven to reassure me that there are still great things in the world. I also received enough food to feed me later on in the day, and I am typically a plate-cleaner. Great value for the price!  I will definitely be back to enjoy another po boy soon - though I should really try something new, it will be tough not to order the same thing (it was so good!)",

I would definitely get a drink from their list when visiting. If you're a whiskey drinker, they have a great selection.  We started out with hush puppies. Great remoulade that it comes with. That was the best thing we ate at Muddy Waters. I got the shrimp and oyster po boy. The shrimp was sub par, and there were few oysters on it. It wasn't bad, but it just wasn't great. My girlfriend got the lobster roll. By the time our food got to us, the bread was soggy from all the butter that they put on it. The lobster and crawfish itself were good, but the fact that the bread was unenjoyable, really puts a dent in that rating.  I will be back to try oysters, jambalaya, and gumbo, along with some other drinks. But the sandwiches were not top notch for me. I would still give it a try! Be sure to book reservation in advance.",

It's actually $1 for East Coast and $2 for West Coast from 4:30pm-6:30pm. Can't get much better than that! Note: you must order a minimum of six.   Upon entering the restaurant, you'll feel like you've transported to Louisiana. The music really sets the tone but so does the rustic feel of the decor. It was rustic, yet modern. The size is a bit small with a long bar to the left as soon as you walk in and a small dining area of tables in the back. You can even watch them shuck the oysters at the bar if you so choose, given those seats are available.   The service was quick. I mean, we did only just get the raw oysters. But the waiter was patient and attentive. We ordered 12 East Coast oysters and they were great. I particularly liked the unique sauce they served with it. It was like a peppery vinegar of some sort that complemented the oysters quite well; although I still preferred just lemon. They also bring out a basket with hot sauce and crackers to go along with the oysters. However, they didn't bring out cocktail sauce so that's something you have to ask for if that's a condiment you enjoy with your oysters.   Oysters are my absolute favorite and I'm so glad to see an oyster bar pop up in Pittsburgh. I will definitely be back for not only more oysters, but to try out other items from the menu!",

We ordered the East-West Coast chef's tasting oysters. These change regularly (daily?) and we were excited to try all of them. The oysters tasted fresh and delicious, and the sparkling wine we got paired beautifully with them. My favorites were the Pickering Pass, James River, and Wellfleet, but we generally enjoyed all of them.  We also split a cup of the chicken and sausage gumbo. The gumbo tasted so rich and smoky. People often talk about depth of flavor, and this gumbo had it. The sausage and the spice were quite nice also. I felt like the chicken could be a bit.. more moist(?), but overall, I loved this gumbo.  I also tried their deviled eggs. It definitely tasted smoky as described and was pretty delicious. A little more pickling in all the other ingredients than maybe I would have liked, but I still loved it.  Muddy Waters seems trendy in a good way; the service is friendly, already knowledgeable (surprising given how new this place is!), and attentive; the food seems great and there are soooo many other items I want to try (shrimp and grits!! lobster roll!!! mac & cheese!!!).  I have a feeling that I'm going to be a regular here. :D",

    "text": "This review is for their brunch and what a lovely brunch it was. There was an issue with our reservation when we arrived as we updated it with more people but the restaurant never got the update. I guess this was done through Facebook so I am not faulting the restaurant. Also they sent out 2 plates of beignets for our table to make up for it.  For starters they have many drink options including an amazing bloody Mary bar.  I don't like tomato juice but  was ready to order a bloody Mary just  for the awesome toppings from bacon to homemade pickles of every sort.  They have plenty of other fruity cocktails but they are a bit pricy.  The brunch menu has a lot to choose from. I don't eat seafood so I was a bit worried but they have a few entrees sans seafood including French toast. I went with the traditional eggs, toast, meat breakfast.  I choose scrambled eggs with bacon and a biscuit instead of toast. They also serve this with a  side of fruit and grits.  So glad I went with the biscuit as it was fantastic-served warm with butter.  Grits can be hit or miss and these were a hit-so cheesy and just the right consistency.  Our  server was great for the large party of 8 we had. My only issue was it is so small inside and loud.   They have a nice bar and I think that is where I would pick to sit next time.",

    "text": "East End resident.  Been going here since it first opened.   The Good:  The food here is excellent.  Not just the quality of the food but the imaginative menu selections.   My favorites are the Fried Green Tomatoes and the Lobster Roll.  The raw bar fare is always superb and fresh - always get the East-West oyster tasting and I'm never disappointed.   The cocktails are creative and delicious and they have a good selection of wines and craft beers.   The Bad:   Drink service is horrible.   Table service is not much better.   I suspect that this is due more to poor management than to the skills of the employees.    It seems that there is poor communication between kitchen and waitstaff and between waiters and bartenders.  Food is often brought out of sync with drinks.  Maybe they need more staff in the front of the house.     I would advise anyone going here to order a bottle of something when you order your cocktails because otherwise you are likely to find yourself for long stretches with food in front of you and nothing to drink.",

Each oyster was described to us, all tasting very fresh and distinct from the others based on geographic location. We had the bourbon pecan ice cream for dessert which was house made and amazing.

The restaurant is small and has a hip, industrial feel to it. We were seated at a small pub table next to the bar and started off with a couple of drinks. My husband got the Sazerac, which was kind of like a New Orleans take on a Manhattan. He loved it.    Everything on the menu sounded so good, we had a very difficult time choosing what to order!  We decided to order a bunch of small plates so that we could try a variety of things. My personal favorite was the grilled oysters.  We normally eat our oysters raw, but grilling them gave them such a wonderful smokey flavor -- soo good for something different! We also both really enjoyed the pastrami salmon crudo; it was a really unique combination of flavors. In a good way. Skillet cornbread and fried green tomatoes were also excellent. As was the service! We did not have to wait long for our food, and our server was on the ball. My only complaint is the price -- I do think it was a little overpriced for the amount of food you were given. But, its totally worth the splurge for a fun date night or special night out!",

We arrived at 12:30 PM on Saturday, giving us 30 minutes to take advantage of the happy hour specials-YES, happy hour specials on a Saturday!   We started with the Cajun Oyster Shooter-SPICY ($4 for HH) and a dozen of the featured west and east coat oysters (East coast were $1.50 each and West coast were $2 for HH). From the regular brunch menu we ordered the Fried Green Tomato appetizer which consisted of 5 large slices of tomato with a delicious pimento cheese spread, a great portion for sharing. For our entree we decided to split the lobster/craw fish roll and although I didn't want the fries at first I am so glad we did. The roll had so much lobster and craw fish, and although not the biggest sandwich it has so much meat and honestly was perfect to share for us. The fries were also delicious, well seasoned with Cajun spice and salt. Muddy Waters also offers $10 off bubbly and $20 off bottles of champagne. We opted for a bottle of bubbly from France and did a DIY mimosa.   Service was good, nothing amazing or worth mentioning. Our orders were correct and came out promptly, so hey no complaints here!",

I have been here for happy hour and brunch. Happy hour is great if you like specialty cocktails and oysters. Brunch was delicious both times I went, however, the last time I went, they were understaffed and service was extremely slow. We were waiting 30+ minutes in between someone checking on us. Other servers passed us by, without try to help as well. We finally got the check and then they never came back to get it! Luckily we had enough cash to cover the check, so we could leave. We got no acknowledgment as we walked out. I'm not counting this place out, since I have had good service before, but use caution if you go on a busy day.",

We went for happy hour. I thought the place would be packed on a Friday but it wasn't. The front of the restaurant is open and airy. We were seated in a high back booth in the back of the restaurant. Corrugated metal on the wall.   Oysters were delicious but we forgot to ask for horseradish...it comes with lemon and some type of red oil.  Ordered both east and west coast oysters to try...all delicious. Minimum order is 12 oysters.   Fried catfish was very thin and breaded with cornmeal so very dry...I didn't like it. Hush puppies were good...warm and soft. Chargrilled oysters were too salty and greasy for my taste...they had parm cheese on top. I'll stick to the raw oysters.  Fried green tomatoes were bland. They came with a really good vinegar cole slaw.  Weren't going to get dessert but so glad we did! Beignets and ice cream. Fluffy puffs of deliciousness.   Happy hour drinks: I got a boilermaker. Shot was Clyde Mays. Good and strong bourbon. Other drink specials are pickle back with a shot of liquor and a shot of pickle juice. There was a cocktail but our waiter didn't tell us what it was and I didn't have a chance to ask him.  There were some dishes we liked and dishes we didn't like but overall it was good food in a fun atmosphere and we will return.",

Pro tip 1: HH: M-F 4:30 PM-6:30 PM, Tues 9 PM-11 PM, Sat 11 AM-1 PM // $1 east coast oysters, $2 wet coast oysters!   Pro tip 2: Sat/Sun brunch, 10:30 AM-3 PM (20 ft long bloody mary jar?!?!?!)  I came with 2 others, and we quickly ordered: 1) Chef's Choice Dozen of East/West Tasting ($36) // Total of 12 oysters.  +1 I love how fresh it is!  +1 Cool story: they change their sauces (I think) every so often....they use fresh ingredients so that your drizzle on the oyster is fantastically paired.  2) Seafood Gumbo x2 ($24) //  +1 OH YESSS. What I've been looking for! It's not your typical red sauce soup base, more of a black bean soup feel.  +1 TONSA SEAFOOD! OH YASSSSS. Hella worth! +1 Rice AND french bread?! NOMNOM. Carb overloadddddd.  3) Fried shrimp po boy ($16) // +1 Fries are yummy!  +1 Sandwich is really big! Lotsa shrimp, that my friend had to take the other half back.  Overall, great spot for a lunch or definitely an intimate bar experience! It's pretty dark in here though, so you won't get nice photos. But, you'll get some tasty food! Solid spot in PA.",

We did have reservations for two but since we added a few more friends last minute we just risked it.  Luckily our friends got there at 430 when they opened and saved some seats for us at the bar.  Next time we will make sure to update our reservations.       We looked at their Happy Hour menu and first decided on some drinks and then we ordered Oysters.  There were dollar Oysters for their East Coast and two dollars each for their West Coast.  We ordered both which was about 24 all together.   We preferred the East coast oysters more.  We put some tabasco on it and we used their homemade vinaigrette with lemon juice to make the oyster just right.       It was a great time!  It was a nice warm day out and they had their window open from the street which made it really nice in there.  It was a very nice atmosphere to hang out in. Like I said it was busy.  The bartenders needed some help I think.  They did a good job but they seemed stressed and needed some more help back there.  We left around 530 and it started to die down a little.  It still was busy but when you stop here be sure to plan ahead and get a reservation!",

I got the lobster roll sandwich with fries. The sandwich was stuffed and overflowing with lobster and crawfish. I like that it wasn't heavily sauced like some lobster rolls, allowing you to really enjoy the taste of the lobster and crawfish. The fries were served a little off temperature...they weren't cold per say, but they also weren't really as warm as you'd expect fresh fries to be. Other diners in our group also had issue with their coffee being cold, but Muddy Waters staff were happy to give them a fresh cup that was much better.",

While $1 was a good deal, the $2 tasted so much better.  It's a difference you can tell, and definitely worth that extra $1.  I ordered the Bergamot Kiss - citrus, refreshing, foamy egg whites.  It was a soft and delicious drink.  We also ordered the duck & sausage gumbo and the chargrilled oysters.  The gumbo was great, and there were tons of meat in it.  The chargrilled oysters tasted soo clean and good.  We just came back from NOLA and this place brought us back \"a little bit\".  The food and drinks were on point, but NOLA is delicious, dirty NOLA... However, Muddy Waters Oyster Bar is a gem in Pittsburgh nonetheless.",

We made a reservation for 12:30, although when we arrived, the place was empty. I was a little hesitant when I saw how empty it was, but eventually around 1:15 more people stopped in.  My boyfriend did the Bloody Mary bar which I was really impressed with. They had loads of toppings and hot sauces to pick from. I got a cocktail with vodka and jalapeno, which was absolutely delicious. It was actually pretty spicy without being too difficult to drink.  We had our waiter choose fresh oysters for us to sample--great recommendations, friendly service and the oysters were awesome. As an entree, the fried chicken and biscuits were great. The chicken was very flavorful and not too greasy, but I did find the gravy to be very salty. My boyfriend's seafood gumbo was rich and hearty. We got beignets as dessert which were delicious, although hard to compare to Cafe du Monde's which we just had a few weeks ago!  Overall, it lost a star for me because the menu wasn't very large and the ambiance of the place was strange when there was no one there. We will be going back, but to try dinner next time as opposed to brunch again.",

    "text": "Stopped in here for dinner on New Year's Eve and I couldn't be more excited to have an oyster bar in the city!  We ordered the large seafood tower which was perfectly shared between Lee and I.  Fresh chunks of lobster meat, a variety of oysters from the raw bar, and head on/tail on cajun shrimp that I'm still raving about!   The sauces that come with the oysters are fantastic, my favorite was the aioli-esque one that was pinkish in color (helpful, I know).  I don't know what was in it but it was sooo good.  The one downside to the seafood tower was that we were seated at one of the high top tables along the wall and it was kind of hard to fit the tower, two plates, beverages, and condiments on the table.  I'd definitely request one of the booths or larger tables if you plan on ordering more than a few snacks.  I was hoping to see a seafood pasta, like a Spaghetti ai Frutti di Mare or seafood alfredo on the dinner menu, but no dice :(  So to round out our meal, we decided to share an order of Oysters Rockefeller which were rather good and served with crusty bread, and the beef tartare which was amazing.  For dessert we ordered the beignets.  Next time I'm here I definitely want to sit right at the raw bar, I love watching the manpower that goes into preparing the perfect plate of oysters.   I think my favorite thing about our meal was that I walked out the door feeling satisfied, not like I had overindulged or consumed anything terribly, uncomfortably filling.  It was a delicious, fresh & quick meal that I look forward to having again soon.  They even have $1 East Coast/$2 West Coast oyster happy hour Monday through Friday!",

    "text": "Oyster happy hour runs until 6:30, and if you're even curious I say \"Go for it!\" The value proposition is phenomenal-- $6/half-dozen of eastern shore oysters raised in the majestic land of wild horses, Chincoteague VA. Considering the labor intensive art of oyster shucking, it's a plum deal.  I appreciated the salty brine of the oysters and how they paired nicely with the supplied lemon wedge, red wine vinegar sauce that accompanied it. The two types of hot sauce were also used, but to a much lesser extent.  We sampled six charbroiled oysters in a delectable Parmesan-butter sauce. One yelped commented that s/he would have preferred the French bread accompanying it to have been toasted and buttered. I think that Muddy Waters nailed it by opting for simplicity. We used the bread to soak-up the butter and Parmesan that remained once we devoured the succulent, perfectly seasoned oysters.  Nice selection of top-shelf spirits--if that tickles your fancy. Happy hour includes deals on \"bottles of bubbles\" and boilermakers. Would like to see that deal extend past Clyde Mays, but that's not necessarily a high-priority. Add it to a wish-list with very, very little to speak of.  TVs above the bar featured a rare afternoon Pens game with the volume on mute. Nice to check a score, but not allowing it to be obtrusive or detract from the chill vibe. Great mural of the eastern shore and view of the oyster shucker from our vantage point.  We used yelp to make a reservation--as it was a busy Friday night and we wanted to partake in the specials. A few taps of the app and we were good to go. Couldn't possibly get easier or more convenient.  Will return to Muddy Waters to take a happy hour tasting tour of the emerald coast's oysters, or to sample their brunch offerings. I did not see much publicized about brunch aside from a chalkboard sign, but I am curious enough to consider it even with limited information.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch after a bad oyster experience downtown and was very pleased to find good fresh oysters in Pittsburgh! We got to sit outside in their restaurant front bar. No alcohol allowed outside yet but they are working on getting a license. Full bar it seemed otherwise. They have a dinner menu which they serve during lunch, a brunch menu for weekends, and a raw bar/shellfish menu.  Shared the east/west coast raw oyster chef sampler ($36 for 12), which had 6 oysters from VA, 3 from MD, and 3 from British Columbia. They were all delicious and fresh. The menu seems to change every day based on what they get shipped in. Unfortunately I can't splurge like this every day, but they have happy hour 4:30-6:30 M-F with $1 east coast oysters and $2 west coast oysters, so I can't wait to return for that.  Also got the chargrilled oysters (5 for $15), rich, delicious and garlicky. I personally prefer the raw oysters but these were well done. We also had a side of Cajun fries ($4) which were great.   The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is the service was super nice and friendly, but slow. In particular the kitchen, think we waited 45 minutes between getting our raw oysters and our hot food. Understandable as they just opened, and got a bunch of togo orders while we were sitting there. I'll be returning for sure and will upgrade to 5 stars as their kitchen fine tunes!",

    "text": "I have a small obsession with oysters which are difficult to find in Pittsburgh, so from the moment I heard Muddy Waters was opening, I couldn't wait to check it out! We secured a reservation and had dinner with two other couples last Friday and had a great experience. Although, I would definitely recommend making a reservation if you plan to go on the weekend or with a larger group. We didn't realize how small the restaurant is and you're literally sitting on top of other tables. For this reason, it's also extremely loud. They had music playing loudly and with the tables so close to one another everyone was shouting to talk. This may not be the case during the week, but on a busy Friday evening we struggled to talk to one another. But that is literally the only negative about our experience here, though. Everything else was great!   We started with ordering all of the oysters, of course. We tried the chefs tasting of both east and west coast oysters ($36 for 12), the char-grilled oysters and oysters rockefeller. They were all wonderful. We especially loved the char-grilled oysters with lemon and garlic. We also sampled the smoked deviled eggs and the hush puppies. Again, the whole table really enjoyed everything! Our server was extremely attentive, made recommendations and always checked in on us. Poor guy was losing his voice from talking over everyone, but he was a trooper!  For my entree, I had the shrimp and grits and it was delicious! Highly recommend this dish. Others in our group had the blackened salmon, the lobster roll and the gumbo - all were pleased with their meals!   I also loved the variety on the cocktail menu - great cocktails, champagne, wine and a solid beer selection. It's not often you can find somewhere that does everything well. The sparkling rose on the menu was wonderful and paired perfectly with the oysters.   I definitely will stop back to try their brunch or happy hour next!",

I am a fan of Blue Point Oysters, and during happy hour they are only $1! They also have a drink special I believe - we typically will get some champagne to enjoy with our oysters as well.   I love going with a small group, because I get to try everything! I love their cornbread and fried green tomatoes as apps. I like the po boy and lobster roll, but my favorite thing to get is whatever fresh fish special they have that day.  I keep coming back here because the food is fresh and delicious, the atmosphere is cool, and the servers are kind and knowledgeable.",

Our other dishes - wedge salad, cheddar grits, duck and sausage gumbo, and traditional lobster roll were all very good. My bottle of Proseco was $10 off and was lovely. We will be back!",

    "text": "Was glad to finally make it over here, as a good oyster isn't always easy to come by in Pittsburgh - although that has slowly been changing. Stopped here during Happy Hour to grab some cocktails on a weekday.  Started with a wonderful old fashioned (not on special) and also had a beer. East coast oysters were in special for $1, west coast for $2. I'm a west coast fan myself and found them to be better, as I usually do. Comes with a simple mignonette and a slice of lemon. Normal prices are $3/$4 respectively, so Happy Hour is a great deal.  We also ordered some hush puppies which were fantastic. Hot, flavorful, and a nice breading.  Bartender was friendly and was more than willing to offer recommendations. Sandwiches sounded great but was saving that for another day as I'll definitely be back.  With oysters on your bill I can see how it can get expensive here real quick if you're drinking, so be wary.",

    "text": "First, I will start off with a tip. This restaurant now takes reservations. I would highly recommend for a Friday or Saturday night to call the week of and make one. We tried walking in on a whim twice and the wait was almost an hour.  We went on a Thursday night with reservations but found it wasn't necessary for a week night because there were many open two tops (but rather be safe than sorry)!  The restaurant is surprisingly small on the inside. Cute but small. All two tops are on your right and bar on the left as you walk in down the aisle. The back has maybe 4 or 5 tables that could sit more then 4 but not more than 6 people.  Our waiter was super cool and laid back. Any waiter that goes over the menu with you is cool in my book. As recommended, we started out with the gator. It was a seasonal appetizer and we are happy we got to try it.  It literally looks like a hot pocket but filled with gator meat. It was very good (warm and tasteful). The appetizer was small. Between my husband and I, we had one and a half each.   As for the entrees, they have a descent sized selection of both raw and cooked meals. We got the platter for two which included shrimp, crab meat, and oysters.  It was fast and quick service, I think we received the entree after ordering in less then 15 minutes (but it is raw so not too much to do except presentation). It was all delicious and very fresh, however, it did not fill us up. So, we continued our venture with their boucherie platter. It says right on the menu its a cajun styled charcouterie board-YUMM. Now that filled us up! It was filled with smoked salmon, tuna, pickled vegetables. It was delicious.  Our bill was pricey but expected from a restaurant that serves fish.  I would definitely recommend!",

We ended up liking the bar a lot and opted not to take the table we originally reserved. The bar is full service and provides a great view of drink mixing and oyster shucking. The space was large enough to hold our platter of oysters and an entree for each of us. Although the seats were all occupied, we didn't feel crammed and liked that they offered hooks to hang our bags/ get them out of the way.   Food was delicious. We ordered the east/west oyster taster dozen, a po boy and a Louisiana lobster roll! Our only complaint was that the fries were saltier than we would have liked!

The bloody mary bar was clever. You get to pick whatever vodka you want (some with infused flavors) which was given to you in a mason jar, and you can add the mix with as many condiments (which included thickcut bacon, olives, peppers) as you want.  Lobster roll was mostly crawfish, so dont expect a lot of lobster. The cornbread was more on the sweet side, almost like a dessert version of zucchini bread. The truffle sauce for the hushpuppies was very good.   Assessment: Great meal for oyster lovers (a good deal especially if you come for the happy hour)  Recommendations: oysters, fried oyster or shrimp po-boys, grits, fried green tomatoes, bloody mary bar",

    "text": "This is my first Yelp review and it's long - sorry about that. Over the last decade I have used Yelp and its contributors countless times to influence my lunch / dinner choices as much as I've used anything else. My wife and I always promise each other to start writing Yelp reviews to 'give back' as it were. I swear to contribute more from here on out!   So, a little hung over from an oyster and beer binge last night, me and my coffee and my dog are going to have at it. The dog is stoked, trust me.  Muddy Waters Oyster Bar. Interestingly enough, (to me anyway - hey, it's ME time here!) much as this is my first Yelp review, last night was also my first experience with raw oysters. I eat pretty much everything and find delight in essentially all of it. Except goat cheese - a pox on goat cheese - if a smell were a taste, the smell of goats is the exact taste of their gnarly, funky chee.   Excuse me. Kind of went off the rails there.   Anyway, for some reason I never dipped my toes into the oyster scene until last night.   Boy howdy! I'm kicking myself for never trying them before. If you love the clean flavors & fresh smells of high quality sushi, shashimi, nigiri, etc., you'll probably love oysters. I think. Unless you have hang-ups on texture or something. Some folks can't eat certain things if the texture of is not to their liking. In any case, this is some good stuff, and I'm hooked. Don't forget to chew. Maybe do a little reading up before you go.  We started off at the stand up bar in the middle of a very tiny space. Solidly in the Top 5 most cramped restaurants I've ever been in. We kind of like that though when we're in the mood for it, which we were.  We had a 9pm reservation but it was 6 and we were hungry, so we walked in, cancelled our reservation, and posted up to wait for a spot at the real bar. We got lucky and landed a nice spot directly in front of the oyster shuckers and the TV for the Buccos game. I say lucky because we stood at the stand up bar only for about 5 minutes before our server (who stayed with us for the evening) let us know he just cashed someone out at the main bar and we should pounce when they get up. I'm glad we did, because this place being what it is, folks pretty much grew roots where they were. The takeaway here is, if you go (on a Friday anyway), you have 3 routes to take. 1) Get a reservation and get it at least a week in advance 2) prepare to stand at the stand up bar, or 3) prepare to watch the main bar like a hawk if you want to sit.   I'll try to be concise from here on out. Bullet points! Still wordy though...  - The staff was great. If you've never tried raw oysters, they will nursemaid you through the process and explain everything. It's similar to wine.  - It's a bit pricy. Which is fine with us (us = my wife and I). You get what you pay for, folks. These are fresh oysters and I'll pay whatever it takes to facilitate that kind of quality.  - It's slow. Which is fine with us again. Our favorite dining experiences are the long, slow, drawn out ones. Think more French service vs. standard US service. Don't expect the server to be breathing down your neck every 5 minutes. Take your time and enjoy the food and your company. Trust me, it's better that way.  - We never even ordered an entree. That will definitely happen next time though. Instead, we gnared with a righteous zest for 2 hours on small plates, apps, and oysters. And I regret nothing! Well, almost nothing. The exception to the rule last night was the deviled egg app. They looked amazing but in our opinion, were actually so-so at best. Seemed a little old or something. Maybe they were straight from one of the staff's backyard henhouses or something and we're just used to the swill that Big Egg forces on us dahn Giant Iggle. Whatever.  - It's loud. Again - groovy. If that bugs you though, be warned.  - It's small. I said that earlier but it bears repeating. If this bugs you, maybe skip out or go on a Tuesday or something. You will physically interact with servers and fellow diners, probably knock something over, and possibly make a friend or two.  - It's fresh. I didn't ask, but Shirley they are flying these things in daily.   - Champagne seems to be the drink of choice. They have something like 10 choices of champagne and almost everyone was busting up some bubbly. That said, they have a very, very solid cocktail, wine, and beer list as well. Kind of weird because I don't remember seeing anyone drinking champagne anywhere under any circumstance the one and only time we visited New Orleans. Maybe we were at the wrong places!   Okay that's it. Abrupt ending in 3, 2",

My husband & I shared the lobster Benedict & the hot lobster roll. They were both excellent, but the lobster Benedict is truly a stand out dish! Almost our entire party ordered it & everyone was blown away by it! And my lobster/crawfish roll was really good, but I did find the bun to be lacking slightly. We did order some hush puppies but sadly they never made it to  our table, but that was hardly even an issue after enjoying some extremely fresh & well shucked oysters. We honestly didn't even care that our app never showed up & our server took it off our bill no questions asked. We will DEFINITELY come back here for brunch & I will be telling friends about this place for sure!",

    "text": "I finally had a chance to try this place out after drooling over the pictures for the past few weeks. I grabbed a couple of my friends and we went to Muddy Waters for dinner this past Friday. I called earlier in the day to make a reservation (which I recommend). The place is on the smaller side but they did a great job making the most out of the space they have. Upon our arrival, we were promptly seated and the waiter came to take our drink orders soon after we were seated. For an appetizer, we got a dozen of oysters on the half shell. It was chefs choice so the oysters were both east coast and west coast (I apologize that I can't remember the names of them all). The oysters were so fresh and delicious. It was really neat to try different kind of oysters to see how different they tasted from one another. One of the west coast oysters had a cucumber melon finish. So good!! For dinner, I got the fried oyster Po boy. You can get your Po boy with shrimp, oysters, or mushrooms. It's topped with chili mayo, lettuce, tomato, and house made pickles. They are also served with Cajun fries. My Po boy was so good. It was fried perfectly and I really appreciated that there was not a lot of coating on the oysters so that you could still taste the oysters on the sandwich, as opposed to just breading. I already cannot wait to come back to this place. I would love to come back for both happy hour and for brunch. Overall, I definitely recommend Muddy Waters! Pittsburgh needed a Resturant like this! :)   P.s. An added bonus for me is that they played Muddy Water's music the whole time. It gave a nice relaxing \"down south\" feel to the place!",

They offer $1 raw oysters during happy hour but they also have a variety of other oysters at higher price points if you want to try out oysters from different regions.   They have a great cocktail menu that I believe changes from time to time. I highly recommend trying one of their cocktails. I usually get a Moscow mule here but my friends often explore the other custom drinks and specials. The bartenders are very friendly and the staff is great.   I am also a huge fan of Cajun food because I grew up in New Orleans. Honestly, most places this far north do not know what they're doing but this place does a good job. I highly recommend their seafood Gumbo. It's the best gumbo I've had outside of Louisiana hands down. I've also tried their cornbread mac and cheese which was surprisingly delicious.   This place is definitely a must if you like seafood and Cajun/Creole and a good cocktail. It's not quite the real deal, but they do a good job emulating some classic Bayou cooking.",

For some crazy reason East Liberty doesn't exist to me for food options, even though I am well aware it should be somewhat on the forefront of my lil squirrel brain. I can't say I was blown away though and was really expecting to be!  I got my tax return and was really feeling like blowing some money on a great meal. I took my boyfriend here and it was pretty fantastic. I ordered the lobster roll and he got shrimp and grits. My roll was simple and successful and my boyfriend's shrimp were delicate and delightful. I'm not sure why I wasn't fully blown out of the water by the meal, it really may just be my personal tastes. I loved the food but didn't think it was interesting/exciting enough for the price tag. But, again, that could just be me and my tastes. There is nothing wrong with simple, good cooking! I would definitely want to go back and try more of their menu!! The happy hour is pretty decent and I wish I could say I ordered oysters but we were not hungry enough to get multiple courses. Next time, it is happening!",

I reviewed the menu before we made our reservations just to make sure that I would want something. I saw wonderful photos of heir food on here and on Instagram and figured I would find something good. We made reservations for 8pm on a Saturday night.  The place is a lot smaller than you would expect. A LOT smaller. It's a very narrow inside. No matter where you sit there are other patrons and employees right on top of you. We got seated at a high top table on the right hand side of the restaurant. The table was extremely wobbly which made it difficult to feel comfortable having a drink at the table.   The server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. My fiancee ordered the big oyster sampler place which she housed like the oyster champ that she is. She also had a side of mac and cheese which she absolutely hated. I had the jumbo which I loved. The taste was awesome but the portion was very small compared to the price that I paid for it. The server didn't come around that much and didn't seem interested in coming back to check on things after the food was served.   We found this place to be completely overpriced and not worth it.  Since it's hard to find a good oyster spot in PGH we gave it a chance. We won't be",

The interior is nicely decorated, lots of industrial metals are used to create a clean, contemporary atmosphere. It is trendy, but not overly pretentious.  At the corner of the bar, there was a mountain of ice and a big selection of oysters. At the time I was there - 2 different West Coast species, and 4 different East Coast. I loved all but one of the East Coast. I do quite like oysters, but unfortunately am not enough of an expert to give an expert review. I'll just say that they were some of the best I've ever had.  As for drinks, there was a nice little cocktail selection, including a couple New Orleans classics like the French 75 and the Sazerac. I thought the champagne of the French 75 paired nicely with the oysters.  I'm looking forward to coming back to try some of the food from the kitchen! The po-boy looks especially exciting, and can also be made vegetarian.   Its always nice to be able to have a place to drop in and have a half-dozen oysters when I'm not super hungry.",

Definitely a fan of their ranch dressing. For dinner my mother and I both got po boys. Mine oyster, my mother's shrimp. Overall a quality sandwich. I liked how they hollowed out the bread to make it more manageable. My only complaint is that the sandwich had a lot going on. With the lettuce, tomato, dill pickle and chili mayo, the flavor of the oyster got s bit lost. Next time I'd probably get the mayo on the side. My wife had shrimp and grits.

The cocktails are meticulously constructed and elegantly garnished. The resulting flavor is on point.   Each menu item is obviously well considered. Today's special was grilled oysters in a Cajun butter sauce. Perfect! Cornbread with bacon in it? Why did it take us this long as a society to put bacon in cornbread? I also tried both the lime in the coconut oyster shooter, which was light summery and refreshing, and the red oyster shooter which was tangy and just a little spicy. Alligator bites? Yes please!

Parking is street so be sure to plan accordingly. The restaurant also takes reservations through Open Table; it does fill up on the weekends so definitely make sure you utilize that.   Staff was very friendly and attentive. There's no kids menu but they did have fried fish sticks, which my son enjoyed.",

The atmosphere, the staff, and of course the food! I have already been spreading the word about this place and I'm sure they'll have good reviews too! I wish I could eat here every single day. I got the gumbo, I was purely amazed at how much seafood this soup has!! Every single bite had some sort of seafood/fish/sausage/pork. I am getting hungry just thinking about it! My husband got the Jambalaya and he wasn't disappointed at all. My son got a big mixture of oysters and he wanted more (he's only 11!). My daughter just got Mac and cheese, but that was just the average food for kids. I can't wait to go back again! I want to try everything on the menu!",

The music has a really nice, New Orleans feel. The green tomatoes are really good. I didn't try the green slaw that came with it but my friend said it had a very strong vinegar taste and she loves vinegar which says something. I had a mimosa which wasn't string but the Fig N Thyme was really good and had the kick it needed. Very great customer service with multiple waiters. It really made a difference in our experience. Char boiled oysters were very tasty. I and my friends really enjoyed our experience. Would definitely come back.",

Definitely filling and worth your money, I'm a big fan of lamb so I love to taste the natural flavor of it; however, the overall flavors were a little bit lacking and on the blander side. They do have a bunch of sauces to compensate for that so it was still good. My friend had gotten some of the oysters and although I'm not a big fan of oysters I tried one and it tasted very fresh and clean compared to oysters I've tried in the past (which is the reason why I dislike them). Food was excellent, the interior fits the atmosphere of the food but was just a little too dark for me. Definitely would like to be back one more time!",

They have a relatively large assortment to choose from in their \"raw bar\" as well as a very interesting menu. I really enjoyed the catfish sticks and alligator nuggets. In addition, their lobster roll was excellent, as were the lamb sliders with pimento cheese. The only thing I've had there and haven't been a fan of was the Mac n cheese.

No--I'm in the heart of Pittsburgh's East Liberty (E'sliberty) neighborhood eating the best canon creole cooking I've had this far up north--but you could've fooled me. The atmosphere is great, big bar, raw bar, lots of two top tables and a few four top booths.   The menu includes apps, sandwiches, large plates, a few sharing plates and variety of seafood towers, raw oysters and cold shrimp and lobster.   I had a few raw oysters which came with a variety of toppings to enhance their taste. Next my wife and I split the fried green tomatoes app with pimento cheese and slaw toppings--and these were the best green tomatoes I've ever had (and we are big time green tomatoes fans).  Finally, I had a large bowl of seafood gumbo which was just perfect. A bit spicy as it should be, loaded with shrimp, blue crab, sausage, crawfish and okra! Topped with rice and baguette.   My wife ordered the hot chicken which came with collard greens, house pickles, cornbread and grits--it was delicious! Incredible southern cooking, average prices for what you're getting and a friendly staff.   We have to go back a few more times to try other menu items--this made our date night list.",

While the oysters were not the best I've ever had, a few things need to be accounted for. First this is Western PA. 350 miles from any ocean. Second, there is a large selection. Third the oysters were very far above average. And lastly, they were very reasonably priced.   I forgot the salumi plate! Also fantastic. Head cheese in PGH? Who would have thought...  Great drinks, although I could have used a bit more alcohol for my $10, very well and promptly prepared. Desserts were also very good. Definitely not the pre-packaged frozen fair that some other restaurants pass off as gourmet.  Bottom line? If you want to eat oysters in da 'burgh, this is your spot.",

The seafood was plentiful and of good quality, but it was overpowered by the smokiness of the roux. The BBQ Shrimp and Grits was buried in BBQ sauce and the shrimp was blackened before they drown it. It was hard to taste the cheesiness of the grits because they too were drown in BBQ sauce. Seafood and sausage were of good quality completely lost in the dish. Oysters were top notch, but run from $2 to $3 a piece. Service was meh, almost like they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. The guy shucking the oysters was friendlier than the waitress or the host. I've had much better meals in way worse places. Skip it.",

We don't get out east in Pittsburgh too often & have been wanting to try Muddy Waters since they opened a few years ago. We were hoping for good oysters, but - beyond that - weren't quite sure what to expect. We got there just in time (4:30) for Friday afternoon happy hour and were seated in a cozy booth. The place is one of those store-front kind of places: not too wide, but it goes way back. Very \"neighborhood bar\" kind of place - unpretentious & you feel welcome & right at home. You enter and walk past the raw bar on your way back to your table (or booth). Nautical theme with a great East Coast mural on the wall. The young-ish staff was friendly and attentive. (And they all wear black tee shirts proclaiming them as \"bad mother shuckers \"!) Our server, William, has been there since the place opened & helped guide us through the New Orleans-themed menu & the specials. We started by splitting a dozen big, fresh Delaware Bay oysters at the happy hour price of $1 each. Thoroughly enjoyable. We went on to shaved catfish (sort of like chicken tenders, only catfish), a combo shrimp & oyster poor boy, and a big wedge salad. (Loved the fresh, vinegary cole slaw that came as a side with the catfish!) They have a full bar, and offer a wide selection off beer by the can (nothing on draft - I enjoyed a couple of Vermont Magic Hat #9s served with Mason jar glasses). We had no room left for dessert, and departed the now-bustling dining room with 2 containers of left-overs and a to-go order of fresh, hot New Orleans-style beignets & chocolate sauce (recommendation: don't go home without them!) What a great dinner & overall experience! Long drive, but we'll be back with friends & family. Thanks, William!",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I recently stopped here for dinner and got seated at the full service oyster bar since there were no tables available in the restaurant.  To start, we got a tasty cheese appetizer which involves a soft cheese spread to put on pita-style spiced chips and home-made pickles.  For entrees, I got a lobster roll and my girlfriend got a shrimp po' boy.  Despite loving lobster, I generally shy away from getting lobster rolls because at most restaurants what you receive is a hotdog bun filled with mayo with a tiny bit of lobster.  The lobster roll here was probably the best lobster roll I've ever had because it was stuffed with well cooked lobster and craw-fish and not even an iota of mayo.  I only wish the bread was as good as the bread used to construct my girlfriends po' boy, but I know it's hard to break tradition with the split top bun for a lobster roll.  The cajun fries on the side were also delicious, and delectably spicy.  I don't indulge in raw oysters, but I was impressed with the variety of different oysters that they offered here to eat.  The service was good as well, and I'll likely be returning soon to have another lobster roll even though the meal overall was a bit on the expensive side.",

So this review might be a little dry  I went to Muddy Waters for oysters (it is an oyster bar!!).  They have a happy hour that starts at 4:30 (when they open) where oysters are $1 or $2.  You have to get at least 12.  Along with the oysters, we ordered the jalapeno hush puppies.  They were great.  Hot, right out the fryer with a tasty remoulade.  We also go the fried green tomatoes.  I am not sure what I thought about them.  Maybe it is because tomatoes are out of season or the \"salsa, chutney\" item had too much vinegar or I think served with the same remoulade **I think** as the hush puppies.   I would definitely go back and try them in season, but on that February night, just not hitting the spot.    The service was prompt and professional and our server timed our meal perfectly.",

Seriously, it's awesome here!   Happy Hour seems to offer a daily $1 oyster special & our group devoured several dozen. The gator bites and hush puppies were so tasty, we ordered 2nds. Their cornbread is STELLAR! Literally the very best I've ever tasted. Everything is exceptionally well flavored and has a little kick of tasty heat to it - just the way it's supposed to! Hubby & I also split an oyster Po'Boy (they're enormous, so splitting was easy). Personally I wish the oysters had spent a few seconds less in the fryer, but my guy was happy with it.   We attended a birthday bash with some great friends here so we had a comfy space reserved for our large party. Service both at the bar where we started and at our table was spot on all evening. These folks were all well prepped on the day's specials & didn't mind repeating when we couldn't remember the lengthy list of available delights.    Great spot to hang out for drinks & some really tasty food. We'll be back!!",

Now, I'm pretty mad at myself for not ordering oysters, but I got distracted by the Bloody Mary bar and the rest is history.  All seriousness, the Bloody Mary bar is the real deal.  It is probably my second favorite Bloody Mary bar in Pittsburgh (first is at Meat and Potatoes).  The selection of condiments for your drink are endless.  You could build your entire brunch around your drink.  And if I wasn't driving that day and didn't have other things to do I might have just done that.  For my main course I had the lobster Benedict.  It was good, nothing over the top, but I enjoyed it and would definitely order it again.  Our table was given a couple baskets of beignets so I indulged in one of those, too.  I almost had to roll myself out of the restaurant because I was very full after all the Bloody Mary options and my meal.    My only gripe is that the music was a bit too loud.  I was excited to catch up with my group of friends but could only hear those sitting directly next to me.  Seating is also tight so the wait staff is in competition with the guests to move around.    I'll come back and order oysters next time.",

You know what makes this even better? $10 off champagne bottles. Seriously, the deals keep coming! I could hit this up once a week just for that combo alone!  But the more you dive in, the better it gets! The heartier food is also fantastic. I've tried fried green tomatoes, oh so crispy fries and a really delicious bean salad side (that day's special) that was enough to fill me after oysters.  Absolutely make a reservation because it's small inside and gets packed on the weekends. I'm sure you could potentially scoot in at the bar, or those adorable seats at the window outside. Can't wait to get happy there again soon!",

My friend and I stopped in around 7 on a Wednesday night and there was plenty of seating. This might not be the case on weekends, as they serve brunch! We ended up sitting at the bar area. Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful when it came to deciding what to order.   My friend ordered the corn bread to start. I was really shocked to see how many pieces they brought out and they were thick pieces. I am not a huge fan of corn bread, but this corn bread was a total game changer in my book. They also don't mess around with the peach pecan butter-delish! She ordered the shrimp and grits as her meal. The shrimp were really large and had the head on still. I ordered the chargrilled oysters and I was not disappointed one bit. I may have been disappointed that I didn't order 2 orders of this, but now I know for next time!   Overall, everything was as fresh as it gets and the prices were what I expected. The only downside is parking, but we ended up parking in the garage by Whole Foods and it's free!",

    "text": "I have been dying to come to Muddy Waters since it first opened and can say that I was definitely not disappointed! A group of girlfriends and I had plans to come here for brunch on Saturday afternoon. Of course, we woke up to a huge snow storm that morning- but it didn't stop us from getting here for a Saturday funday!    Once we all battled the snowy streets of Pittsburgh, it was around 1:30 that we ended up getting here. The hostess informed us earlier that there was an oyster shucking class that afternoon, so we weren't able to reserve a table for our group. We ended up sitting at the bar which was fine, but I would have preferred a table- especially with a larger group. The atmosphere inside is super clean and cute! It reminded me of a restaurant that would be at the beach- which was super refreshing for a frigid January afternoon! The service here was quick and efficient- I have no complaints!   We started our lunch with plenty of cocktails and an order of the cornbread and various oysters for the table. The cornbread was served with an amazing sweet butter. This hit the spot for a cold day. The oysters were also phenomenal! We were seated right in front of the oyster bar- so it was fun to watch them prepare the oysters for us. They were served with a tasty vinegar to put on them to make them more flavorful. Their oyster menu had a lot of options & our waiter helped us choose some based on what we told him we liked, which was perfect since I personally don't know a lot about oysters. For my lunch, I ordered the bahn mi shrimp po boy with the cajun fries on the side. I could not stop eating this po boy- there was so many flavors with the perfect amount of spice! I look forward to coming back to Muddy Waters in the future!",

I almost didn't go to Muddy Waters after finding it on Google, reading the reviews and the jerks representing your restaurant who responded.  Grow up.  THAT BEING SAID...  It is a quite small oyster bar + restaurant in Pittsburgh.  Yes, you will pay more (ironically) than even Manhattan, but the oysters I had were quite high quality and the ambience is nice.  Plan on $50 min per person, and most of the oysters are $3 each, so not a bargain by any stretch.  The oyster po' boy is great, and the burger is also quite large and satisfying despite being around $14.  Waitstaff was friendly but not overly attentive, but for a leisurely meal doesn't matter!  I recommend for a special occasion, or just a nice evening splurge.  Weekends will be packed, so make reservations or go at non-peak times.  Their social media team needs to be fired.",

Today we had a lobster roll, sausage hash that was on special, wedge salad and the seafood tower. The wedge salad was overly acidic-it was sour. The waiter told the gm of my complaint and she was very accommodating offering to take it off the bill which I appreciated. He also messed up and brought the wrong dish which is a forgivable mistake but still a mistake when one person watches everyone else eat for 10 minutes or so. My problem with their food is that they try too hard. A lobster roll should be about the lobster-not overwhelmed with seasoning and toppings. Everything is a few ingredients over the top and just overwhelming in one direction. They have a good raw bar but don't deserve more than 3 stars for shipping and shucking fresh seafood. Their prices are nearly at Eddie V's level as well which is by far the best seafood in Pittsburgh-go there instead for your fix or stop in MW's for happy hour.",

Sat at the oyster bar and those guys were kicking out the trays of fantastic, fresh oysters. They really knew their stuff and spoke to the flavor characteristics of each type of oyster. We even had a couple oyster shooters. Fortunately, we have relatives in Pittsburgh, so we will make this a destination whenever we come to town. Thanks Justin and Nate!",

    "text": "This place is absolutely delicious. The gator bites, the Nashville Hot Chicken, and the jambalaya are the dishes we ordered. Just so those who don't live in Pittsburgh near East Liberty know, there is NO parking available besides street parking, and at the nearby target, but the street parking is almost always full during night hours.   The chicken feeds two people happily. It's pricey, but when you find out it's basically a huge southern happy meal of sides and chicken cooked to perfection, there's no room for complaining. The biscuit that comes with the dish is delicious.   The jambalaya is portioned very liberally and can feed you for dinner and for lunch the next day.  The gator bites were good, and the aioli served with it paired very well with the taste and texture, but they were a bit pricey.   We didn't try any oysters this evening, because the boyfriend does not like them, but I am sure I will come back another time for them.",

    "text": "We were extremely excited to try this place out given the high marks, but we must've come on an off night. The restaurant itself has a more casual feel with some personality in its decorations, but with the high price and quality of food and service, we were sorely disappointed.  The east coast tasting of oysters was okay. We also ordered the Louisiana Lobster Roll and Seafood Gumbo. Something must've happened in the kitchen because the lobster roll had absolutely no butter at all; it was a dry piece of lobster in a roll. The Seafood Gumbo also lacked flavor and didn't have much taste. The fries were okay, but didn't have any particularly special texture nor flavor and were slightly soggy.  Service was also a miss. The servers felt inexperienced and disorganized. Our waiter was not thorough in explaining the menu, and he was inattentive to our table. My husband had ordered a drink from the bar and no one went to pick it up. When the waiter was prompted to finally check in on the drink, he brought it over to us with nearly all of the ice melted, leaving the drink watered down. Honestly, it shouldn't have been served at all.  Unfortunately overall the level of service and quality of food here did not justify the cost for us.",

DELAWARE BAY: Tastes 'basic'. You'll know what I mean if you compare it to the others. It's $1 though! KUMIAI ($2 during HH): This one was pretty bomb, maybe West Coast tastes better than East Coast? Mmm, be sure to get a order of 6 of these. LOBSTER ROLL ($22): Wowweee! This was sooo buttery like dripping butter no me gusta. Also it wasn't very big so don't be convinced by pictures. Lobster and the fries were good but not as crispy as I'd like.  I don't have the biggest appetite but zamn we both ended up dishing out like $40 which is kinda a lot since it was happy hour and we're broke college students but it's ok it was kinda worth. Wasn't exactly full though. *nervous laugh* I'd maybe come back, but I believe there is another restaurant in the Strip that does oyster happy hour too.",

They also have happy hour from 11-1.  Most recently I went for normal happy hour which is 430-630. On Tuesday's there's also live music and a second happy hour from 9-11. Parking can be found on the street (digital meters) or nearby garages.  Happy hour was perfect. We were seated at the raw bar with a front row seat to the oyster beauties. They have $1 east coast and $2 west coast. Honestly the east coast were way better; meatier in my opinion. We splurged since I had a gift card from work and got bottles of bubbles since they were $10 off (you'll feel like a baller and not break the bank, do it).  After legit 3 dozen oysters, we paced ourselves the rest of the night with fried green tomatoes (huge slices, firm, perfectly fried), Mac n cheese (so cheesy), hush puppies (I wish I had some now) and the rosemary and roasted garlic cornbread with Abita root beer glaze and smoked sea salt butter (this was like a dessert and i legit wanted to keep eating the butter).  Can't wait to come back!",

Muddy Waters is selling bottles of wine to raise funds for The Tree of Life Synagogue. All proceeds go to the synagogue! How amazing is that?  We went in at 4:30PM for HAPPY HOUR. The oysters are sold at discounted costs (about $1+ cheaper). The menu is helpful in that there are \"Oyster Tasting Notes\" on the back.  [Atmosphere] Chill vibes. The bar has a cool marble countertop and minimalistic design. The wallpaper is very thematic. Light fixtures are artsy. Pops of blues liven up the place.  [Service] Then employees here are phenomenal. Friendly. Helpful. Patient. You can tell they care for their business. A big reason for the high rating is the service! Kieran was awesome! Cool dude with some sold recs.  [Food] The Hama Hama and Squalli Absch were really good. I personally liked the cleaner, sweeter taste of Hama Hama. Def try it out!",

    "text": "A few weekends ago, a friend of my boyfriend's was visiting from Maryland and we wanted to go out for a nice brunch. Maryland does have better seafood than Pittsburgh does, but we decided on going to Muddy Waters to see what their brunch specials had to offer. This was both of our first visits to this restaurant, so we were really looking forward to it.  We arrived later than most of our friends, but as soon as we sat down we looked over the menu and decided pretty quickly what we'd like to eat. It was a Sunday afternoon and the Steelers game was on, and I wasn't sure going into this that there would be a TV in the restaurant. To our surprise, the game was on! It was nice to be able to keep up on the game while enjoying our time here. I ordered the fried oyster po boy, and my boyfriend got the lamb po boy. I gave him a hard time about ordering lamb at a place predominantly known for seafood, but when it arrived I ate my words because it looked delicious. The lamb was juicy and there was so much piled on the sandwich that it was falling off and had to be eaten with a fork. The po boys were gigantic, and the side of fries was a decent portion size, too. Two of our friends at the table ordered the lobster eggs benedict, and that would have been my next choice if I wasn't feeling a po boy during this visit. All the pieces of lobster were huge and looked buttery and perfect. Everyone at the table with us seemed pretty happy with their meals.  Muddy Waters has quite a few specials during their happy hour on drinks and oysters, and I can't like and act like I'm a huge fan of raw oysters, but I do enjoy them cooked. I'd love to come back and enjoy a happy hour here. Also, I'm a big fan of bloody Marys, and the bloody Mary bar seems amazing here because there are tons of things you can add into them to jazz them up. The service here was great, and prices were fair for the portions and quality of the food. I'd recommend this place for brunch for sure and for anyone that really enjoys good seafood!",

With the raw bar they serve a watermelon sauce that is served in a eye dropper. Tasted great and makes a very interesting presentation. Can't wait to return and sample more of the menu and try some exciting sounding and great looking cocktails. Enjoy!",

As we walked into the restaurant, we can immediately see the whole shelf of liquor and the oyster bar on the left side. We seated close by the bar and able to see the oyster chef delicately open the oyster as order come in.   There are wide range of oyster to pick from. The server is very patient and take time to explain to us the different between them. Other than oyster, they do have other menu items to choose from.   I would said this is my first time been to an oyster bar and it is a good experience. I love the chill environment with some fresh oysters and delicious food.",

My friend made reservations on Wednesday night around 6pm - because we hit traffic, we made it to the restaurant around 6:20pm. The restaurant wasn't too crowded, so it wasn't a probably that we got there late. We got seated in a booth, which I preferred because I hate high top tables.   Our waiter (Alon) came to take our drink order, but went over the specials too fast. We ended up ordering a bottle of Pino Griot / they had half off bottles on Wednesdays.   Alon had a bad attitude with us. When we tried to order oysters, he wasn't helpful - we aren't familiar with how to order the various of types of oysters and was looking for some guidance- he didn't share any. He seemed irritated that we had questions about the menu. We ordered some East Coast and West Coast oysters- I enjoyed the East Coast ones better.   We also ordered a couple small places to share - we ordered the hush puppies and Mac n cheese. A few of the hush puppies were uncooked and gooey - they were nothing to write home about. The Mac n cheese was good, but it was a little too spicy for me.   My entree, I ordered the lobster and crawfish roll with a side of fries. The lobster roll was tiny for the price point of $22. I also had some very tough pieces of lobster that made me turn my stomach. The fries were okay, nothing to write home about.   I can understand the appeal of Muddy Waters  - I would tell you to try it yourself....And I would go back one day, but not for a while.",

The gumbo was incredibly seasoned and absolutely delicious. It's a little on the spicy side so beware when ordering this but I would definitely order it again. I also had the hushpuppies, which were good, however, I'm used to having hush puppies that have a little sweetness to it and these do not. They still had a great flavor to them and I love the pieces of corn throughout the hushpuppy. The sauce that it came with also complimented it well. I also had the pleasure of trying my friend's meal who had the banana fosters french toast. This isn't just your regular degular french toast! It was almost like a bread pudding with banana and bourbon flavor throughout. Absolutely delicious and the bacon that came as a side had a nice smoked flavor to it. No complaints here! I can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu.",

    "text": "FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!  Hands down one of the best restaurants I have been to in a very long time!  Our server Marley was so knowledgeable about oysters and their entire menu.  He took the time to explain the different offerings of Oysters to us.  His suggestions were so good that we decided to get a second tray of Oysters. The pineapple and vinegar sauces add so many different levels of flavors to the different oysters!   He suggestions for dinner (lobster roll, alligator po'boy) were delicious and cant leave out the cat fish sticks for an app. Service was attentive and quick but not overbearing and the atmosphere of the place makes you feel like you are not in Pittsburgh.  Every employee that we came in contact with were friendly and flashed a smile.  Cameron at the bar was also fantastic.  This place is a gem!!!  Thank you for the great time and we will be sure to be back!!!",

    "text": "My family and I checked out Muddy Waters on Father's Day per a recommendation from a coworker. The restaurant is definitely on the smaller side so it may be best to get a reservation if you plan to go. The main reason I checked this place out is for the Bloody Mary bar. While it was not the best I've ever seen, it had some interesting options such as raw oysters and pickled green tomatoes that I haven't seen anywhere else. Which is one thing I really look for in a Bloody Mary bar. Everyone can do a Bloody Mary bar but how can you make yours stand out from the rest.  As for the food, it wasn't out of this world but we definitely liked it. 3 of us got the breakfast biscuit and 1 of us got the special quiche. Overall I think they took something that was relatively basic and boring and made it a little better by putting their own spin on it. I'm not a huge biscuit fan but their biscuit was amazing. That topped with an egg and red onion marmalade how could it not be good!?   A coworker has told me that the lobster eggs benedict is also amazing so I will definitely be back to give that a try and also to give the lunch/dinner a try.",

    "text": "For a super hipster eatery, this place actually appealed to me! It really was perfect. I went during happy hour and it was da bomb.   Hubby and I went all out and ordered 24 East coast oysters, the hot chicken entree, the skillet cornbread and the beignets! Everything tasted amazing and the ambiance was relaxing and nice. It is a rather cramped interior with uncomfortable chairs but their Bayou menu makes up for it. The staff is very friendly too. Everyone was pretty attentive whether they were your waiter or not. The beignets came with this bourbon caramel sauce that I swear I got tipsy from, lol.   Usually, I would not give cramped, expensive popular places with no parking many stars, but I think the appeal of Muddy Waters was too much. I'm a sucker for New Orleans themed things and this one just really satisfied me. Well done. I will be back to try the rest of the menu.",

Muddy Waters offers a unique and hearty take on brunch and I loved every second of it. The lobster eggs benedict was my brunch pick and it was completely amazing. At $20, I hoped I was going to get my money's worth and I did. Lots of lobster pieces strewed around the biscuit, ham and poached eggs - my stomach was very happy.   My friend tried to the fried alligator and waffles to be a little adventurous. NOTE: This is more than enough food for two people. Alligator was piled high enough that people from other tables stared at the plate of food before us. It was a bit of a spectacle but that wasn't the best part. The best part was that the fried alligator was DELICIOUS. It's like a slightly more chewy and flavorful chicken! So maybe it didn't end up being super out of the box, but it was pretty delicious.  Also, service was really good! Our waiter was really friendly and happy to talk us through the menu.",

Saturday evening December 1 we had made reservations for 730 party of 5 when we arrived they had seated another party in our place so we went and sat at the bar, ordered drinks after a short while and many apologies from several workers we were told they could seat us at a booth until our table was ready also because of the mix-up would receive complimentary bottle of champagne it wasn't long before we got the best seats in the restaurant and given VIP treatment by the staff! Started out with Cajun oyster shooters, fried green tomatoes and hush puppies for apps all delicious followed up with several different types of oysters and gumbo finished with beignets!! I highly recommend this restaurant and give kudos to staff and chefs!!",

    "text": "Completely underwhelming. First, the good - the cocktails I had were well done with top shelf stuff. Really enjoyed the drinks. The atmosphere is the usual trite hipsterville stuff - nothing offensive, but nothing unique. Safe. The staff was efficient with a discernible lack of passion and/or personality. It seemed all business to me, but for some that's good enough. I tend to like a staff that is lively, effusive and possess a witty demeanor. During my visit it was all 'whatta you have? Gotcha. Here you are. Everything ok?'. Attempts to dive deeper in conversation didn't go anywhere. Whatever... So, the food. Ordered fried green tomatoes as everyone seems to and they were fine. Ordered a po boy and it was fine. My partner ordered seafood gumbo and it was...wait for it...fine. For $24 I want really good not ok.   So I get that I am actually not in NOLA so I should be less critical, but I think there should be more to a New Orleans themed restaurant than 1. Delta music on juke 2. indulgent use of salt... 3. remoulade. Perhaps I'm being too harsh, but with these prices and with the hard sell of an eating on the bayou experience I think they could deliver more than they do. I'm glad I went, but I don't think I'll go back. Frankly, for what my bill was -  I can get a RT ticket to New Orleans. That is not hyperbole. It really is not.",

    "text": "First impressions: My family (dad, mom, stepmom, two younger sisters and young cousin) came in on a Thursday night to celebrate my mom's new job. My mom made a reservation for 6:45, but we were able to be seated early (6:30) because we arrived early. My mom, sister, and I arrived first and were seated. We then were informed by the rest of our party that my cousin would be joining us as well, and the staff quickly accommodated the extra person. Awesome! We mentioned my mom's new job to the waiter and he brought my mom a glass of champagne on the house (I am underage, so I did not taste any drinks myself, but she said it was wonderful)!  Service: Our waiter was awesome! I'm sad I didn't get his name so I could give him the proper respect. He was very attentive, always quick with refills on water and other drinks, and overall very helpful and friendly. The entrees were a little slow coming out, but it was definitely worth the wait. Plus the restaurant was busy (yes, busy on a Thursday night!), so it's totally understandable. There was a minor problem. My mom wanted the Oyster Po Boy but asked for it with no bun. It came out with a bun, which is no big deal but just a slip up I thought I would mention.  Atmosphere: A little noisy because of the loud music, but not a huge issue.   Apps/Sides/Drinks:  - My dad got the Ain't Got No Thyme. He is not a fan of bourbon, but still enjoyed the drink a lot which speaks volumes.  - Pork Rinds: The table enjoyed them. I was not a fan, but that was because of personal preference rather than execution.  - Hush Puppies: These were excellent, and so was the sauce that came with them. Definitely would recommend.  - Cornbread: A little too sweet in my personal opinion, but still tasty. The bits of jalapeno were not overpowering if you're like me and are picky about spice, and they helped with the sweetness. The bread was nice and moist and served with plenty of butter.  - Grits: I was happy to find that these were plenty cheesy (lots of restaurants skimp on the cheese), but the texture was a little off. I wish they were creamier and not so lumpy. Still delicious though.  - Dirty Rice: My dad thought it was a bit mushy and bland. I didn't taste this, but my sister agreed with him.  - Parmesan Truffle Fries: Really tasty and good with any meal! Not really above and beyond your expectations for parm truffle fries, but still done very well.  - Duck and Sausage Gumbo: Everyone enjoyed this dish, and I found it interesting that it had a smokiness to it, which is not something I usually experience in gumbo.   Main Course:  - I ordered the lobster roll. The bun was very soft and fluffy and brought everything together. The lobster and crab was cooked nicely. I kinda wish more had been done with the dish though. It was tasty, but basic.  - Whole fried fish: My stepmom got this. The fish depends on the night and tonight it was some sort of bass. It was so good, she had the chef come out so she could thank him personally.   - Hot Chicken: This dish is very spicy, but also really tender. It can be hard to get tender chicken breast, so I was very happy with the outcome here.   - Oyster Po Boy: My mom really enjoyed it, despite the bread mishap. I tried one of the oysters and wasn't a huge fan. Seamed like more batter than oyster (although I'm not a huge oyster fan so I'm probably not the best person to judge).  Dessert:  - Beignets: A hard pass. I was really disappointed in these. The texture was awesome but there was NO sweetness at all in the dough. The only sweetness came from the powdered sugar. If there was no powdered sugar, you could probably serve them as yeast rolls. It came with a chocolate dipping sauce that just tasted like melted chocolate chips. If you want really good beignets, try Nola on the Square downtown.  - Chocolate Pecan pie: Pretty good, but the chocolate chunks in it were unnecessary.  Overall: Great service and great food. Avoid the desserts. Will definitely be back though!",

    "text": "Came here around 5 to get in on oyster happy hour specials on a weekday. This was part 2 of a quest for good seafood.   AMBIENCE A- Simple decor and small tables. It felt intimate, but not stifling. Clean counters and a small open seafood bar area. Nothing to write home about, but in my mind that's a good thing.   SERVICE B+ The guy was nice. He ended up carding (and then apologizing) my friend who is well past 21. Which was funny. But as the night progressed I started getting slightly more uncomfortable with each interaction with him. Maybe he was just really awkward, but he stopped looking at me and at one point directed all questions to my (male) friend. I thought I was imagining things until we left and my friend mentioned how awkward it was for him as well that I kept getting ignored. 'It seemed like a lifelong back of house guy really wanted to wait tables and is just not doing so hot yet.' Hopefully he's getting better at it!  DRINKS B Since I'm predictable I had the French 75. It was the flavor of a limocello. Cool it with the lemon juice!   APPETIZER A We went at such an early hour just to have $1 east coast and $2 west coasts. We had a few happy hour priced oysters and then branched out from there. The selection was ok. Was surprised that there were none from Long Island, but they were all quite fresh. They came with a mignonette sauce, so don't expect cocktail sauce!  MAIN COURSE A- I ended up having a bowl of gator gumbo and the sausage and pierogi plate. The gumbo was pretty good, but needed a bit more salt. The sausage and pierogi were fine. My friend got the gator po boy. I lost him for a few minutes while he inhaled it. It was apparently very good. His came with Cajun fries which tasted great but weren't very well-cooked.   DESSERT I ate too many oysters. I can't remember if there was a dessert menu.   Will be returning again for oysters. And if I can convince a few more friends to come, a seafood tower.",

Before sitting down - seated over 30 minutes late (had reservation) - while waiting for table, we were directed to standing bar waiting area. Given menus and told we could order food/drinks. No one came over for over 10 minutes (after walking up to misc. waiter to ask if we were supposed to order at main bar or if someone was coming...) - drinks didn't come until moments before sitting down  While sitting down - Couldn't hear waiter at table and had to ask him up speak up when talking about menu  - Had to ask a different waiter to get a second drink (main one disappeared) - Main waiter forgot to bring a drink my friend ordered at table - Mixed up items on the check  Honestly, I wasn't keeping track. This list is just what comes to mind the next day.    Food was great, props to the kitchen.",

    "text": "I've been looking forward to visiting Adam Kucenic's new place since the Post Gazette gave them a preview back in June of 2015. I have been waiting a long time to find a place for oysters au naturel this far away from the coasts--Muddy Waters Oyster Bar is here, and it was worth the wait.  Tonight I was looking for simplicity, and after Adam talked me through the four eastern offerings and the two westerners, I chose the full range with a chef's selection of 12. This gave me two of each, and ample number to share with my two other companions. Neither of them had ever sampled a raw bar, and this was a fine first experience. The oysters, served on ice, were just the right temperature. Not too cold to attenuate the flavors, but yet cool enough to help support a nice clean edge. The flavors were clear and bright, the subtle notes of limestone minerality, tangy brine, elemental flavors of the living ocean mixing and swirling with each other. All the liquors were clear and limpid with just the right weight on the tongue, supporting the firmer texture of the oyster itself. A well balanced range of flavors: assertive and sharp, comfortable and gentle, sweet and flavors of melon. Fortunately, no heavy cocktail sauce in evidence, just fresh lemon and a well crafted mignonette. Well done--these fellows had been well treated from oyster bed to bed of ice. Not easy to do, and not done without appropriate expense. Adam and his suppliers are to be complimented.   The only suggestion I would make would concern presentation--a bit more visual flair would be helpful. A touch of green, perhaps dill sprig, parsley, cilantro--a bit of contrast. And,with a more abstract arrangement--think of the flair of the best Neopolitan pizza makers--let's just not circle the shells on the perimeter.  Tonight I only sampled one more item from the menu, the pimento mac & cheese. A solid offering, set off with crumbs well browned and mixed with bits of bacon, Just a tad too long in the oven--a bit more flow to the cheese matrix would have made it a 10.  And, of course, there was the Abita Purple Haze. Would not have thought of a Pilsner with a touch of raspberries at first, but it worked! And, from NOLA--what's not to like!  A great evening! Congrats Adam! Will be back soon!",

So last evening my girlfriend and I walked over from her apartment to try it for the first time. I have been to New Orleans over a dozen times and am a wine and food lover and I looked forward hopefully to finding a place here in PIttsburgh. Sadly what I found was very disappointing. My girlfriend and I split the chargrilled oysters, fried green tomatoes and hush puppies as appetizers and then the Blackened redfish for dinner. Having eaten at the Acme Oyster House in NOLA many times the oysters were a sad representation of those, not very good and a terrible valued. The fried green tomatoes were okay and probably the best thing that we had though it was the remoulade sauce from the hush puppies that brought out the flavor not the sauce that accompanied them. The hush puppies were bland and seemed undercook, I have had better at Long John Silvers, and the Blackened Redfish which I had been looking forward to was under seasoned and had very little taste.   A small offering of wines that match nothing on the menu with small pours and large prices. Little ambiance, cavelike and noisy. I am sorry but I see no need to come back.",

I am not a fan of mussels (however my other family members were impressed with them) but had my share of the freshest prawns and lobster I have had in a very long time. Salmon was cooked to perfection but my favorites of the night were the sides and garnishes. Smoked Brussel sprouts, hush puppies ( don't think Red Lobster) , fried green tomatoes ( the best I have ever had), smoked deviled eggs, pickled green beans and homemade pickles. Can't forget the grilled bread that melts in your mouth either. Good selection of wine. Bartender knows what he is doing and is not stingy with his pours. My mom must have ordered 8 different unusual concoctions and he was able to deliver. Decor is cool with jazz music in the background. Parking is limited so allow yourself time to get there. Thank you Muddy Waters for an incredible dinner and really great service. We will be back soon!",

I made reservations to celebrate my birthday with friends last Saturday, or so I thought, upon arriving to my reservation, I was told that there was a mistake and my reservation was put in their system for NEXT Saturday. I made the reservation myself, and know that I clearly stated the purpose and the date of my visit. The staff, including the manager on site was not only unapologetic to me and the slew of friends that I brought to eat and drink in their ephemeral restaurant, they were downright rude to me, and others in my party who tried to figure out a reasonable solution. That being said, we walked next door to Livermore, and they were more than happy to accommodate my party, and we even invited a few more friends to join because the experience next door was so nice. At the end of the day, its all about service, and I will never step foot in this place again because of the rude, unapologetic, and immature behavior of the staff. The oysters could be made of pure gold, and this place will not survive with a staff like that.",

    "text": "We were pretty disappointed with Muddy Waters, after years of waiting for an oyster bar to open in our part of the country. The very slow service has already been addressed in older posts so I'll skip the part where we waited for 30 minutes for our drinks. My real problem is with the food. Oysters are oysters, and as long as you have a regular supplier anyone can put them on the menu and they will be good. I live in the neighborhood and saw that they get their seafood from the same distributor that most restaurants in the area do, so nothing exciting there - the oysters are fresh and there is a selection of about 6 split between East and West coasts. If you go for those alone, this place would be fine (as soon as they get the service thing under control). However, we ordered two really simple and classic entrees - BBQ shrimp and gumbo. They were both terrible. Even if you had no prior experience with these foods you would be unhappy with what we got. The shrimp were enormous, served whole. They were also so over-cooked I could have bounced them off the floor. Enough said. The gumbo: my understanding is that gumbo should be lots of fresh seafood, sausage and veggies in a rich roux-thickened meat stock over rice. The sauce was super dark and tasted of burnt flour, with little seasoning besides salt. There were about 4 very small chunks of sausage a few teeny tiny out-of-a-bag popcorn-type shrimp (again, rubberized) and a few overcooked vegetables, all swimming in a lake of the dark stuff. It did have good rice though. For the price of these things, it gave the appearance the that management is trying hard to make as much money as possible quickly, because what we got was not any where near what we paid for. I hope they turn things around and don't just count on people buying into the concept and not really caring about what they are served. One caveat is that I'm sure the fact that we made reservations for a busy Friday night and that they were clearly overwhelmed influenced what we found on our plate.",

The service was very attentive and knowledgeable. We went for brunch on a Sunday at about 2 PM. The place was very busy and a lot of people were getting up and down for the bloody mary bar which looked great and included a ton of items to add to your bloody mary. I had a Sazerac and my wife had a French 75, both superb. We had an assortment of east and west coast fresh oysters and they were great. My wife had the lobster eggs Benedict and loved it. She said the hollendaise was especially good. My son had the lobster and crawfish roll and cajun fries which were hand-cut fries with cajun spices. He ate it in about 3 seconds, I had the gumbo which was the best i've had since New Orleans. In fact, it was as good or better than anything I've in NOLA. For dessert we had the Biegnet which were spot on clones of those at Cafe Du Monde. All in all, it was a great meal. When we left my wife asked if I thought we could get reservations for dinner that night. That's high praise.",

Almost out of necessity, we started with the Chef's Oyster Sampler from the east coast. One of the things we love about this place is that their oyster selection always changes and we were very happy to see new additions as well as an expanded selection. As always, the oysters were delicious and a great start to the evening. We got cornbread and fries to start which were both superb, some of the best fries in the city in my opinion, while the bite from the jalapeno in the cornbread was delightful and delicious. For an entree, we split the fish of the day, which came whole (I must admit I've forgotten the name of it but our waiter said it was similar to Black Sea bass), that was absolutely superb with amazing greens and polenta. We rounded everything out with some fantastic beignets. Overall this was one of the best meals we have had in Pittsburgh and Muddy Waters has quickly become our favourite restaurant in the city. On top of the amazing food, the staff is amazing. Our waiter last night, Real, is incredible knowledgable and very friendly with impeccable timing on when he checks in and brings the food. Guaranteed to have a great experience if you sit in his section. So thank you Muddy Waters for another fabulous experience!",

Muddy Waters was busy on a Sunday evening but wasn't loud. Everyone at the table was happy with their orders. I ordered the po boy sandwich and got half shrimp and half oysters - one half was all shrimp and the other was all oysters. The po boy was tasty though could have used more kick and the order came with fries which were seasoned well though some were soft. My friends really loved their orders: gumbo, bbq shrimp grits and fried green tomatoes. Food seemed to come out a little slower than we had wanted however our waiter was kind and checked in on us periodically. I am so happy there is an oyster bar finally in Pittsburgh and Muddy Waters is priced reasonably that I will be back again. One thing we had thought of was that Muddy Waters should team up with the other businesses for valet as there is only street parking and nearby garages.",

The Chicken and Sausage gumbo has this dark roux which I've never had before and will want from now on.  Apparently, they literally cook the roux until it's burned, I guess?  The result is smoky, spicy, layered and awesome.  Chicken and sausage both tender, okra (which I'm not generally a fan of) cooked perfectly and not slimy.  The Lobster Roll WOW.  Large, unctuous chunks of lobster and crawfish dressed in a whole lot of butter - verging on a little too much, but it works - and really, really tasty cajun fries.  But the star of the meal was this unassuming little bowl of perfection they called cheddar grits.  If you like grits, you have to have them.  They're the best I've ever had - a perfect creamy consistency that made this Southern boy very, very happy.  Great beer list, cool upscale rustic room...I'll be back when I'm in Pgh next time, for sure.",

    "text": "Always fans of a raw bar, we looked forward with anticipation to try this new oyster restaurant. Unfortunately, we were left rather underwhelmed. A dozen oysters cost $36 which may be standard but significantly limits how many oysters one can reasonably order. This would be okay if the other food items were exceptional but sadly they were not. The food is more reminicent of mediocre bar food. I ordered the lobster roll. While the lobster was fine the bun it was served on was not properly toasted or buttered, felt like I was eating my lobster in sad little hot dog bun- kind of doughy. My husband order the oyster po boy- nothing special, not memorable- just seemed like a lot  of starch. The oysters were lost in it. We ordered the steak tartare- would describe as courser than we are used to- not so appealing. Ordered the pickled devilled eggs, these too seemed liked they were prepared in advanced, a bit disappointing, lacked a delicate hand. We normally gobble these up but we actually left one behind. Lastly, we ordered the mac n cheese- this was served in a skillet that was obviously placed in the oven, I suspect to make it toasty on top but the effect was to dry it out. Funny thing, we picked at it a bit and there was sufficent left over so we asked to have it packed up and accidentally let behind. My husband realized later and commented what does it matter, it wasn't very good, not sure we would have eaten. This is a sad commentary. I do hope soemone from the restaurant reads this, because we are happy to see new food places open  in our neighborhood but I do think that that once the novelty wears off they will need more substance to sustain. Our total bill was $120 which is a lot given the quality of the food.",

    "text": "I was between 3 and 4 stars for a review, but I decided to go back and try again in the hopes that I can bump it up.  First, the food was excellent.  We started with the hushpuppies and cornbread, and both were surprisingly light on the grease-factor and worth the price in terms of size and quality (6 large hushpuppies, and 4 good-sized squares of cornbread).  We had the lobster roll and fries and the seafood gumbo.  For me, the lobster roll was too garlic-buttery, but that's kind of how it's supposed to be.  It's one of the few in the city that goes the butter vs. mayo route, so if that's your thing, it's a substantial portion of seafood for the price (albeit the lobster is cut with crawfish).  The seafood gumbo was delicious.  A little heat, but a ton of seafood.  I had no problem at all paying $24 for something that hearty and generous.    We also had the cocktails, one sazerac and one Mardi Gras special drink.  The sazerac was ok...not common on drink menus around here, so I was happy that a creole/cajun restaurant was smart enough to at least try to include it.  The other drink was a funky combination of Purple Haze, mezcal, and flavored shrubs.  It was very heavy on the mezcal, which can be a pretty acquired taste, so I wish they had dealt a little more deftly with that flavor.  We had a reservation and still had to wait about 15 minutes, which would have been less irritating if they actually had somewhere to wait.  It's a pretty small place, so we had to sit at the bar, which unfortunately took seats from people just looking to sit at the bar and give business to the bartender for a bit.  The other complaint was that though our server was very personable, we were done with our cocktails mid-meal but he didn't offer us another cocktail until our plates had been cleared and we were finished.  We were wanting to have another drink, but at that point we were done with the food and felt kind of like he was trying to quickly turn over the table, which wouldn't be surprising given the limited seating.  He also didn't offer dessert, so I'm not even sure if they have a dessert menu there.  Not a big deal, but if you have a dessert menu, I'm usually a pretty easy sell.  Overall, great food, ok cocktails, but the experience seemed a little too rushed for us, whereas most restaurants at this price point tend to give you time to relax and enjoy it a little more.",

The oysters were good, and the ponzu and cucumber/lemon (or whatever it was) sauces on the side were interesting. I probably would have preferred regular ole cocktail sauce and horseradish, which I know they also offer (if you ask for it). The lobster roll, while stuffed to capacity, unfortunately, was so incredibly tasteless, and the lobster/crawfish was overcooked and chewy. I understand this was not a typical New England-style lobster roll, but I had expected it to at least taste like something, anything. The Cajun fries were pretty good though. Overall, I left unsatisfied, especially because I had chosen to dine here instead of at another restaurant nearby.",

Place was pretty calm and not packed but our waiter said that brunch for them is mainly busiest on Sunday's.   Our waiter was AWESOME. My friends both got the bottomless mimosas and I got the Bloody Mary bar. At no point did we have to ask for more mimosas he just kept them coming! And the Bloody Mary bar was second best I have experienced. First is definitely Meat and Potatoes.   Amongst us we got the shrimp and grits (head on shrimp), chicken and biscuit, and Lobster Benedict. Every single one was absolutely incredible. The ingredients were beyond fresh and the mix of flavors were very well executed.   I will definitely be back to try dinner!",

Quaint and comfy, yet still a modern feel.  Let's start with the service.  The people working here are stellar!!  Super friendly, engaging, willing to answer questions and just humor me at times.  Seriously, they are fantastic.  They have a great happy hour with discounts on food and beverages.  $10 off bottles and I believe $20 off Champagne (sign me up!).  Also beer and other specials on drinks.  The bar is fully stocked, but the focus is more on your whisky (whiskey).  A great list of specialty drinks lines the menu and the bartenders are easily able to deviate from that list and make the drink you want.    They have a pretty solid food menu with the focus being on seafood.  Oysters are the big seller here and what they are known for.  We decided to have the cornbread and some friend gator bites.  I think the cornbread was some of the tastiest I have ever had, except for maybe a visit to an establishment in New Orleans.  So delicious.  The gator bites are good as well, nice crunch and not overly chewy.  This is definitely a nice addition to East Liberty and a place I will likely visit again.  Give it a shot, you will not be disappointed!",

    "text": "I visited Muddy Waters Thurs. of the week before last for HH.  I'd been wanting to check it out for awhile, but wasn't sure which of my friends enjoy--or would be willing to try--oysters.  Given that Chelsea S. and I wanted to get together for HH, I suggested it.  Fortunately, she was game, so we headed over to check it out.  We ordered a half dozen each of two different types of Oysters--West Coast and East Coast.  At HH, oysters are discounted at $1 each for West Coast and $2 each for East Coast, but you have to order them by the half dozen to receive the discount.  Between the two of us, we polished off a dozen quite easily.  We started with the West Coast oysters, which were a variety from WA, and they were mild and creamy, as good West Coast oysters should be.  We then proceeded to the East Coast variety, which were from VA, and they were brinier and chewier, but still delicious.  I tried the one of each type unadorned, and both were definitely enjoyable in that form.  However, they were improved by the tangy and slightly spicy mignonette sauce that came with them, so I added a helping of this to all subsequent bivalves.  As a Cajun/Creole themed bar, Muddy Waters specializes in drinks with New Orleans roots.  Accordingly, I ordered a Ramos Gin Fizz and Chelsea ordered a French 75 ($10 each).  This was my first gin fizz, and I can definitely call myself a fan!  Due to the inclusion of beaten egg whites, it had a light, airy, and foamy head which gave way upon imbibing to a refreshingly tart liquid body.  It had a nice alcoholic kick which was muted by the lemon and foam, making for a well-balanced drink.  While I didn't try Chelsea's French 75, I could tell that she enjoyed it.  Although we didn't have a reservation, we were able to get seated without a problem at the oyster bar, where we were able to watch the employees shuck oysters.  Service from our waiter was cordial, which was also nice.  Overall, we very much enjoyed our HH experience at Muddy Waters, and would definitely return!",

I got a bloody mary and I was really impressed with the selection of hot sauces and garnishes at their bloody mary bar. The whole oysters,  shrimp,  bacon, and stuffed cherry peppers where especially delicious!   For my entree I ordered the lobster Benedict and it was insanely delicious. I really liked the biscuit,  ham,  and huge pieces of lobster. The crawfish hollandaise was delicious and the exact right consistency(I could have used a bit more, but that's more of a gluttonous desire) and the egg was perfectly poached.   My husband ordered the gumbo and our guest ordered the special which was a fried oyster omelet with chiccharon and a side of andouille sausage. When my husband heard chiccharon he requested a side if the kitchen could accommodate, and they brought out a small fry basket full of them. It was nice to see a kitchen willing to accommodate crazy requests and at a reasonable price.   Everything was delicious and fresh. We loved it and can't wait to head back there for a happy hour at some point.",

Their charred oysters are palatable and the hot fried chicken is juicy but needs proper seasoning to be edible. The collard greens are salty and the grits are grainy. Maybe I'm a New Yorker with a sense of flavor but I would love to see small businesses thrive, please do better. HOWEVER, They do have the best sweet potato cornbread in the Burgh, texture and taste is delicious. Don't touch the CB.",

For our first visit, we had hush puppies and the oyster appetizer, which was awesome.  We went for our second time last night and were officially sold. We tested out four different raw oyster options and the fried green tomatoes. I got the shrimp and grits and he got the seafood gumbo. All amazing!  Not only is the food great, but so is the service/atmosphere. Our server, Nia, really made our dinner memorable and sealed the deal for us. We were originally seated next to a boisterous group of guys that were being pretty loud, and without even having to ask, she offered to move use to a better location. She was super helpful in explaining the oyster options to us, and gave us a ton of great information on their happy hours and brunch options! It was cool to learn how the oysters are brought into the restaurant, and that they have their own oyster farm in Virginia. She also recommended their delicious sour beer collaboration with cellar works.  Anyway, we love it! Great food, great team, great place :) Thank you!",

But I saw almost every tables ordered one to share so shouldn't be disappointing to more experienced tastebuds.  Tonight we had a group dinner of five. Thursday evening not too busy and we've got seated quickly. I've tried the gator jumbo with a spring salad this time. Jumbo is tasty with very substantial chunks of meat. Spring salad is heavy on creamy dressing, so if you're looking for a light salad maybe gets the dressing on the side.  I also tried their banana pudding once. It was very impressive. Not your ordinary pudding but more like a cake. Dense, moist, and you can taste the real banana. A must have if you love banana.",

A friend and I decided to order the cornbread and gator bites along with Mexican got chocolate spiked with tequila.   The cornbread came out in two large wedges. The cornbread wasn't so sweet but also wasn't soggy. It had a good flake however, the butter that came with it was a little underwhelming for me. The dish had a good taste however, was not worth $9 and did not taste as good as it looked on the menu.   The gator bites were tasty, fried to perfection and the alligator inside was moist and tender. The Mexican hot chocolate was not good. I was able to drink it however, the tequila overpowered every other flavor.",

Our waiter was super friendly and attentive. I ordered a Mimosa (3/5 standard OJ Mimosa but it was straight up juice), while my other 2 friends ordered from the DIY Bloody Mary Bar (5/5 menu says the price starts at $8- the price depends on what type of vodka you ask for and there are a lot of great toppings to choose from including raw oysters, shrimp, bacon etc.) We also ordered a couple of Oyster Shooters (5/5 standard but delicious).  For my entree, I decided to order 2 things off of the 'Pre-Gamers' in order to try more things. I ordered the Fried Boudin Balls (3/5 the pork sausage balls came apart very easily and I didn't love the flavors), and the Gator & Sausage Gumbo (4/5 tasty gumbo, especially the alligator meat and a decent portion for $9). My friends ordered the Seafood Gumbo (4/5 honestly if you want to try the gumbo but not order the entree portion I suggest ordering the appetizer gumbo. Pretty much the same thing except the entree has more seafood/different kinds of seafood), and my other friend ordered the Louisiana Lobster Roll (4/5 both the meat and the roll were way too buttery but otherwise delicious).  NOTE: my friends and I wanted to order the raw oyster with uni on top but apparently this was a 'special/seasonal oyster' that they offered a while ago/don't offer it anymore.",

Maybe it was the Don Wayne talking (a \"tiki\" style drink? uhm yes PLEASE), but the oysters tasted fresh and were so easy to eat one after the other. Before we knew it, the tasting platter we got, which included a selection of east coast and west coast oysters, was gone. To be honest, my palate is not refined enough to tell a difference between the two coastal oysters. We were still a bit hungry afterwards so we ended up ordering from the Happy Hour menu and got a dozen more of the east coast oysters (**Side note: during Happy Hour, east coast oysters are $1 each and west coast oysters are $2 BUT you have to order them in batches of 6, so either half a dozen, dozen, etc). A woman sitting next to us at the bar ordered some fries which smelled HEAVENLY, so of course we had to get some with the Cajun spice. No regrets. What topped off this whole experience was that we got an entire beignet dessert from the table behind us since they were too full to finish and didn't want it to go to waste. Well, to the kind couple that sent us that delicious plate of beignets, it did not go to waste. I will definitely come back again when I am craving oysters.",

Bar good selection. Service average speed. No one is rushing you here. We talked for several hours. Went with my daughter and her husband. Excellent experience over. Prices are average for oysters about $1.50 per.  I don't comment much on menu, you can look this up for most restaurants and make up your mind everybody's taste are different . If a restaurant does not post their menu online this is not a good sign.",

I ordered 3 dozens of featured, a soft crab sandwich (), blackened salmon (), fried alligator, smoked boudin, and a cold lobster tail.  Service is 5 stars. Food is 4.5 and it's super fresh. I like the fried food especially because it's really light. Almost like tempura kind of lightness.  It's muddy good to drop by if you are in Pittsburg!",

    "text": "I had my New Years Eve dinner at Muddy Waters with two friends. I really enjoyed the casual, upbeat atmosphere from the instant I walked in the door. There were mounted alligator heads on the walls (fake I hope) and a long bar to illustrate that this is truly an \"oyster bar\".  My dining companions and I settled into a booth and ordered the hush puppies to start. They were some of the biggest hush puppies I have ever had! And very flavorful, arriving to our table hot and steaming with a creamy sauce for dipping.  For dinner I had the Louisiana Lobster Roll which was incredibly impressive. The roll was about the size of a hot dog bun (one of excellent quality) and it was stuffed with lobster--completely stuffed! Absolutely no filler to be found, and the meat was completely drenched in butter. I was not at all disappointed.  My boyfriend ordered the shrimp po' boy, and the bite I was able to steal was flavorful and the shrimp was very fresh. I would've liked a bit more slaw or something to cut through the rich sauce, but that's just me.   I will definitely be visiting Muddy Waters again, but next time I'll try some oysters!",

If you yearn for a little taste of the bayou, and love a relaxed atmosphere with good service, this place is your thing.  We did it all - oyster platters x 2, hush puppies, foie gras deviled eggs (MUST HAVE), po' boy, shrimp and grits, you name it, they got it. It was yummy.  Nice drink list - their Sazerac was pretty tasty, and it had better be; It's NOLA's official cocktail. Service was very attentive, and all of the staff were friendly and knowledgeable about their menu. Music was a tad louder than I'd like, but that's probably just me as I turn into my own grandfather... overall, a great place for good friends and family to sit down, relax, and chow down on some really fun Louisiana staples. Laissez les bons temps rouler!!",

They had a huge area to make your own and everything and I mean everything was there including any pickle you could think of. Also was bacon, shrimp and oysters. For food I got 4 oysters two from the west coast and 2 from the east. I am a osyster novice so was suprised it wasnt served with horseraidish but with a house sauce and in a drop bottle the spicer version. It wasnt bad and all the oysters were yummy. I also got the New England lobster roll which was filled with lobster and crawfish covered with butter, also the cajun fries. Fries were a suprise hit very tasty and really makes the meal.",

    "text": "If you are looking for oysters in the Burgh, look no further than Muddy Waters.  Especially if you want to indulge in several varieties.  Now coming here during their happy hour can help keep your bill light, however if you are like me, one dozen oysters just aren't enough, so even at the great price they can add up quick!  The happy hour is awesome though.  Select West and East Coast varieties ranging from 1-2 dollars.  The west coast ones will run a tad higher at the $2.00 price tag but the sweetness of the oysters make them so, so worth the extra buck.  The east coast varieties tended to be more briny but all is good and they pack a delicious flavor.    We've been here a few times now, but showing up during the happy hour is the best time to come.  We have also had several of their craft cocktails which are quite good.  The beer list is limited but sufficient and Happy Hour deals on champagne.  We have tried other items off the menu but it's the oysters that keeps us coming back for more.",

    "text": "After discovering my love for oysters and Cajun food in the Big Easy I knew I needed to try this place out. I've had oysters at a few other places in the city and they just don't compare to the ones you get in Nola. So I had given up on ordering oysters in Pittsburgh until I heard about Muddy Waters. I was very excited to try this place out and it lived up to all the hype! If you are looking for oysters in Pittsburgh, you MUST come to Muddy Waters...best in the city for sure!   My boyfriend and I made a reservation and arrived early so we sat at the bar and ordered some drinks. The drinks (Lavender Bees Knees and New Fashioned) were great as was the service at the bar so when our table was ready we opted to just stay and eat at the bar. I def recommend making a reservation though because it's not very big. They also had live jazz music which was pretty cool.  We ordered the chargrilled oysters and they were so delicious we had to get another order! I wanted to order everything on the menu but had to control myself. So after the oysters, we went with the fried green tomatoes which in my opinion was a no brained because not many restaurants have them. Oh and did I mention they come with pimento cheese?! Pimento cheese is also hard to come by and a favorite of mine...tomatoes were absolutely delicious and crisp to perfection. A very filing small plate too. After that we ordered the sausage and gator gumbo and corn bread. The gumbo was amazing, very tasty. I'd say prob the best gumbo you're gonna get in the city. Cornbread was also good but I was not amazed by it. It was a little dry, but I'm a cornbread lover so it was a must try and I'd prob get it again. We did not get dessert and I regret it because the beignets looked amazing.  All in all, everything from the food, drinks, atmosphere, service was wonderful and a great experience. I did not get to try everything I wanted so I will absolutely be back!",

I have been to a few oysters bars and the quality of this place is up there, reason for 4* is because of the price. I guess happy hour with $2-$3/oyster is more reasonable than the regular menu price.  We had the mixed appetizer with 4 oysters, half crab salad, 3 cocktail shrimp, and a lobster tail for $37. Also we tried the pork rinds ($4), which is also very good and crunchy, great with beers . Main course I had the 14 oz NY strip. The seasoning is a little salty for my taste but the steak was tender and juicy even though i ordered well done. Overall i would come back try out some other item on the menu. The food is good enough and the service was very friendly.",

The drinks were tasty but lightly poured so no worries if you order a couple. I had the smoke break and the New fashioned. If you like boozy the New fashioned is your best bet. The fried green tomatoes were perfect just the right amount of cornmeal breading. The hush puppies were also good. The smoked Lamb ribs were a tossup. The flavor profile was amazing but they can be a little fatty. The seafood gumbo was good but lacked real spice. There was a minor upset at the beginning regarding seating... The hostess worked it out but asked that we leave the table by 630. We got there at 5 so it seems odd they would leave that table empty for 90 minutes? Place gets really noisy as it fills up so be prepared for that. I would do it again but it would fall behind some other eatieries locally.",

Very clean, meaty, and sweet taste.   The bahn mi po boy was excellent, with shrimp that were cooked just right and a creamy but not overpowering pate. The cleverest part is the Thai basil, which adds a unique flavor and aroma.  The seafood gumbo was recommended by our waiter, and I'm glad I listened to him. The shrimp, crayfish, catfish, and sausage had good flavor and excellent texture, and the brown gumbo base was perfect for dipping the provided baguette.  Certainly one of the better meals I've had in Pittsburgh, and a great value if you're craving oysters.",

The place looked different and interesting with oyster bar. I was afraid to try oyesters since I didn't know if I am allergic to that or not. Next time, I am going to try oysters and update my review.",

Unlike wine, every oyster tastes distinct even after a dozen down, unlike red wine where 3 glasses and you don't know whether you're drinking moonshine or what! Only reason I don't give 5 stars is because the shucking was improper, my wife got shells twice in her share.",

    "text": "I've been back twice now since my first experience, both times for brunch.  The first time was in early December for my dad's birthday and the second time was this past Saturday with my girlfriends.  The seating situation has improved and I was able to get reservations, though neither time it was very busy to the point where I actually needed them.  Their brunch menu is nice because it has the breakfast items and then the sandwiches and a few other more lunch-type dishes.  I have tried their poutine fries, sweet potato cornbread, bbq pork benedict (winter special, maybe?), lobster benedict, chicken and biscuits, bahn mi shrimp poboy, plus a couple of oysters.  Everything has been delicious.  They have a large bloody mary bar set up in the middle of the restaurant and you can choose what type of infused vodka you want as the base - which is an awesome touch.  Our service was much better the second time, but the third time was just OK.  Our server was very nice, but we sat at the oyster bar (as they weren't accepting reservations or putting together larger tables due to an oyster class coming in at 2pm) and I think the people behind the counter/hostess were annoyed.  All in all, though, far better experiences than when I came here for dinner a year ago.  Definitely check it out.",

After coming here, I can definitely see what the hype is all about.  My boyfriend is a big fan of Cajun/ creole food, so I figured I would take him out for dinner here. Mmm we both LOVE it! I've driven on highland so often but I've never noticed this place being here, it is kind of hidden. The atmosphere here is great and intimate. Perfect for a date night! I would say it is a pretty small place, so I would definitely recommend a reservation in advance. We came here without one and did not get seating, but we don't mind sitting at the bar :)  It is pretty cool watching the staff making the oysters.  For food, we ordered hush puppies, lobster roll, and seafood gumbo. AMAAZING! We pretty much cleared the plates in less than ten minutes. I love the little kicks to the seafood gumbo. It is probably my favorite. The lobster roll is so fresh, also the fries that came with it is so well seasoned. The hush puppies is so flavorful, we are def big fans of these.  The price is a little higher than my normal going out dinner. (Broke graduate student.. ya know?) However, after trying their food, I would say without a doubt worth every penny. I would def come here again, maybe for a special occasion.",

They have a nice variety of oysters from both the west and east coasts. Outstanding selection of whiskeys.   My fiancee had the lobster and crawfish sandwich. It was served on a buttered pretzel bun. It had a flavorful Cajun seasoning.   I was torn between a few options but decided on the shrimp and grits. I think anything on the menu would have been fantastic. They grits were super flavorful in a Cajun broth yet still a little creamy. The jumbo shrimp were perfectly cooked. They were white and tender with a little bit of clearness that you see in raw shrimp. The grits had peppers, caramelized onions, pork bits, green onions, and a couple of raw tomato slices on top. Great balance of textures with the softness of the caramelized veggies, the creaminess of the grits, the snap of the shrimp, and the crispness of the raw tomatoes.  We shared the beignets with chocolate sauce for dessert. I'd recommend those too even if you're not a huge dessert fan. During the night, they had a live performance from a small three person group. They created a fun atmosphere with their bluesy yet upbeat music.",

And they're definitely better than your run-of-the-mill deviled eggs. The sweet pickles were a nice addition.  Would I go back? : Without a doubt.

    "text": "*HIGHLY RECOMMEND*  Who would've thought that Pittsburgh can have such FRESH oysters?!!!! My friends and I went during their happy hour time, which is basically most weekday from 4pm-6pm. Oysters were ONLY $1 or $2 depending on where it's from (East coast, West cost, the bay, etc). Everyday there will only be a certain selection of oysters to pick from, so you can go a different day and get to try new ones. Forewarning, you must order oyster in a set of 6 and that set of six must be from the same area and coast cannot be mixed. But, that was no problem because they were worth!!! And it was fairly cheap!   Oysters: We basically tried all the different kinds of oysters that were available that day. I cannot recall all the names but the Delaware Bay was my favorite. The lemon and the vinegar provided gave the oysters a bit of a kick, but it was good even without the condiments. It was so so fresh and smooth! It melted in my mouth.   Fried Green Tomatoes: I've never had fried green tomatoes but they were good. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. The sauce reminds me of spicy mayo.  Pork Rinds: I've never had pork rinds before either. It was more dense than I though but the seasoning was very flavorful. Very crunchy but at times it keeps sticking to my teeth.   **VERDICT:  Would I go back again? YESSSSSSSS, just for the oysters.",

It doesnt have the firm texture and more toward salty taste. So if that is something you like then I recommend to get it. Chargrilled oysters is also just okay.  Cocktails on HH is $6 which is a good deal. Maybe I should have read the description more carefully when I saw hurricane and I thought it would be similar to hurricane drink in NOLA, but it was completely different. It was good but a little bit water down in my opinion.  I would go back again for happy hours.",

I recommend following them on Instagram to hear about specials and ticketed events in advance. We've enjoyed a pig roast, crawfish boils, and several varieties of premium oysters they've made available. Service is always friendly and attentive (they're great about food allergies) and the atmosphere is super relaxing. It's our go-to spot whenever we have out of town guests. Takeout is also a breeze, and we frequently call in an order of their delicious jambalaya with chicken and shrimp after a long day at work.   Recently we've been coming here for brunch, and I really like the variety of options they offer. Brunch is Saturday and Sunday and there's a great Bloody Mary bar, brunch punch, and many Louisiana-style takes on breakfast dishes as well as favorites from their standard menu. In short, Muddy Waters is an all-around fantastic restaurant, and I know I'll be a devoted fan as long as they're a part of the Pittsburgh restaurant scene.",

I had the Louisiana lobster roll and my friend had the Nashville hot chicken. The lobster roll was delicious and buttery, but I honestly would have preferred it to just be lobster and not combined with crawfish. My friend enjoyed her hot chicken and it was a huge serving! Overall, enjoyed my food and would want to come back to try brunch!",

The chargrilled oysters were SO GOOD. you must order them!! The raw oysters were delicious as well....  cool clean space and great service. I will def be back so I can try the rest of the menu!",

    "text": "Very cool little bar! Was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and wanting to try this place after walking by and getting a whiff of the enticing aroma of oysters on the half shell. We decided to head in for brunch on Saturday and were very happy that we did! At just after noon, the place was hopping but we were able to find seats at the bar. Brunch happy hour included oysters for as cheap as $1 each, which we were thrilled to see! Menu also included a variety of fun cocktails, craft beers, and wines. They also boast a good variety of apps and entrees, many with a Cajun/New Orleans twist.   We decided that the sweet potato cornbread would be a good balance to our 18 $1 each oysters, and ended up being right. The oysters were very nice quality for the price, and the sweet potato cornbread was served with a sweet maple drizzle and savory whipped butter that we couldn't get enough of. Service was attentive given how busy the place was and we were impressed with the hard work of the staff. Would definitely recommend the place for anyone into seafood or Cajun fare, or looking for a fun place to go with friends or a date (especially during happy hour, given the affordability!).",

We got the oyster sampler and I have to say the west coast oysters don't have that strong if a taste and it is more delicate. The east coast oysters are bigger and stronger in flavor. I also liked the cooked oysters. They were seasoned really well. I would recommend those if you do not eat raw food.   I made a reservation so there was no wait either. I would definitely come back here whenever people want to try oysters!",

I stopped in here on a Saturday night around 5:30 and was lucky enough to score three seats at the bar, but they were packed and I would definitely recommend usually making a reservation!   I can't say enough about the food or the service. We had two wonderful bartenders who were extremely friendly and kept our glasses of bubbly flowing all night as we worked our way through the menu. We tried the east/west oyster platter, the Bloody Mary oyster shooter, hush puppies and shrimp cocktail. I can't say enough good things about the oysters and the hush puppies. It truly transported you to a beach town, even on a cold rainy night in Pittsburgh.   I cannot wait to go back and explore more of the meal options. However, I'd want to sit at the bar again for another wonderful experience!",

Every bite can be a delicious combo of flavors enhancing the fresh, well-shucked oysters (no shells in these bites!).  We also had some hush puppies that made you want to slap yo grandma!  Yummmm!

If you are a fan of Smokey drinks then this is for you.  It was pretty close to closing time so there were not a lot of people there so service was quick.

We had the chargrilled oysters, which hold their own against the best we've had in NOLA, the succotash, watermelon salad - which came with these absolutely divine little balls of fried goat cheese, and the birthday boy indulged in some fried gator which he pronounced to be out of this world. I'm not a big jambalaya person but it was well spiced like everything else and quite good - not too hot and very flavorful. You can't go wrong here!",

There's even a Double Happy Hour Tuesday nights!!  Anyway we had been here before but this time I decided to review. The Bloody Mary bar is pretty great. Pro tip: start at the end, it's where the oysters, shrimp and bacon are.   We had two dozen oysters (the West Coast Hendersons were fantastic), a Low Country Hash, and a Seafood Gumbo no rice.  The Seafood Gumbo is completely loaded with 10 ounces of seafood. It included crawfish, oysters, shrimp and lobster. It's a dark gumbo, almost mahogany, and very flavorful. I thought it was super legit that they would do it without rice and while the price wasn't cheap, it was fair considering the amount of seafood.   But if you need oysters, just come here. Make it easy on yourself. Can't beat dollar oysters.",

We started with the rosemary cornbread and a couple of east coast oysters. The cornbread was a 10/10, served warm with slabs of butter within. The oysters were good too - definitely fresh.  For our mains, we had the seafood gumbo and the oyster Po Boy. Both were decent but nothing the shout about. The Po Boy was a regular Sandwich with tomatoes, iceberg lettuce, mayo and oysters - there could have been more filling in the sandwich. The fries that came with it were way too salty - make sure you tell them less or no salt if you want to be able to finish them. The gumbo was decent with a decent amount of seafood, but not the best you will have, and the portion could have been slightly more generous for a main. The food didn't feel or taste like it was \"made with love.\" Even the ambience and waitstaff were a little cold - not as friendly as I would have liked.   Overall, it was a decent experience, but the only thing we would go back for would be the cornbread and oysters. Service was quick. We were in and out in less than an hour.",

My most disappointing food item has been the catfish. I normally LOVE catfish and couldn't even eat more than one small piece. It was dry, chewy, and smelled a little too fishy for my taste. I know I was *literally* eating fish, but the smell was a tad too pungent for me to be comfortable. Even the sauce that came with the catfish didn't make it better for me.  My favorite food item from Muddy Waters doesn't even come from the sea. Their corn bread is the best corn bread I've ever had and it comes with equally wonderful apple butter. The corn bread is made with sweet potato and is perfectly moist and flavorful. I could eat it for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I wish everything at Muddy Waters was as good as the cornbread, but it isn't. I guess the pimento cheese is also good, but pretty basic pimento cheese dip.  Happy hour is also pretty limited. If you like oysters they are always discounted and have been good during happy hour. The drink specials are not very *special*, but they do have $10 off bubbly deals that make it possible to purchase a decent bottle of sparkling rose for $26.  Overall, you could probably have a good dinner or brunch at Muddy Waters, but it's nothing special. Service is generally good, food has been hit or miss, and I've usually spent more than I've expected- even during their happy hour.",

    "text": "I have two great things to say about this place. Food and service.   Service...number one: my parents and I popped in here on a Saturday afternoon and I totally did not realize they were closing between lunch/dinner. That didn't stop them from serving us! They did explain that kitchen (hot food) was closed, but raw bar and drinks open. Thanks!!!! (Felt like kind of a jerk once I realized we were in the break time.)   We ordered the chef's east/west sampler and three cocktails. The server fully detailed the types of oysters displayed (beautifully) and their tastes, regions of origin. Very informally informative.   French 75, some bourbon and a Bloody Mary gave those oysters a real pop.   The atmosphere is totally chill and makes it perfect to relax, imbibe and have some great conversation.   Music selection was on point! Made my pops pretty happy!  I checked out the Happy Hour menu and it looks fantastic!! $1 and $2 oysters and drink specials. Other items off the raw bar look great too, but it's going to take me a lot to steer from those salty oysters. CAN'T WAIT to return.",

Its hard to find fresh tasting seafood and oysters, but muddy waters does it well.   We sat at the oyster bar and ordered oysters. 12 to start. I enjoyed them but wanted something different. I ordered the alligator po boy while my boyfriend ordered 100 more plates of oysters and chatted away with the guy shucking them.   I enjoyed the alligator po boy, but I didn't care for the season on it (too salty)  $170 later (IN OYSTERS.. my boyfriend is a tiny guy but he cant EAT) we were on our way. After chatting away with the oyster shucker and waiter, we were invited to their superbowl party. (how cool)  Still love this place! The guy shucking oysters explained they are brought in daily on a plane... now that is FRESH!",

    "text": "Raw oysters: Out of the east coast ones, Irish point and permaquid are bigger and have a more metallic taste. Permaquid also has a strong smell. They are also more salty. The rest of the east coast oysters are less salty and have more of an earthy flavor. I really liked the one called James river. The oysters from the west coast are smaller in size and sweeter. We tried Hama Hama. It was pretty good.   Cooked oysters: we tried the chargrilled oyster. You get 6 of them on a plate with bread and lemon. It was quite delicious.   Appetizer: we tried an appetizer called, as far as I can recall, halushka. It wasn't listed on the menu but suggested by them. It was a pasta like dish made out of egg dumplings, Brussels sprouts and pork. It wasn't the best thing I've ever had but it was filling and ok.  Wine: we tried a Portuguese white wine suggested by our server and it was pretty smooth.  Service: this place was pretty crowded for a Tuesday evening. Service wasn't slow. We were in fact given sufficient attention and checked upon regularly and asked about the food. Service was good. Ambience was nice. Music was upbeat and they also have live music. However space is less and we felt a little cramped. Good experience overall",

We came here on Christmas Eve and they had happy hour specials. One of the offerings was $1 oysters with a minimum order of 6. I am not a big oyster eater but YOLO so I ordered them. You can't not order oysters at a restaurant that's known for its oysters lol they were pretty fresh and big. Not as salty or strong tasting. We paired it with their $10 off special of a bottle of bubbly. We got the Italian prosecco. For my entree I got the banana foster french toast sans bacon. It was a nice size portion and very flavorful. I liked the bread they used for the French toast. They also have a Bloody Mary bar during brunch. I don't really like bloody Mary's but it seems like a good deal for $10.",

    "text": "Yum!  I love oysters and was spoiled living along the coast for a long time, so I've always been kind of iffy about eating them in Pittsburgh.  Muddy Waters is the place though.  They have a decent selection that you can mix and match and you can watch them shuck right next to the bar.   If you aren't a fan of raw oysters, they have several cooked varieties.  I recommend the grilled oysters that are dressed with a butter sauce and served with a warm hunk of baguette.  More filling that you would think and very delicious.   I usually pair those with their succotash dish to make a complete meal.  The veggies are varied and cooked to perfection and then topped with a perfect egg.   They have a happy hour too, so if you happen to like the items they feature (raw oysters, bubbly, etc.) you can save a few bucks.    Three minor gripes bring the score down a star.  First, the wine selection is on the pricey side and the pours are pretty light.  Second, the pimento cheese is just a travesty.  I LOVE pimento cheese and was so excited to see it on the menu.  I ordered it with the fried green tomatoes (which were a little underdone and greasy).  It's not traditional pimento cheese, but rather some sort of Cajun-Creole take.  Whatever it was, it did not work for me at all.   Finally, I am on a crusade to rid the world of backless barstools.  I hate them.  Despise them.  Loathe them and  everything about their posture killing uncomfortableness.   Muddy Waters has a whole line of them.",

The gumbo is spicy with a lot of jalapeno peppers.  The Fried Shrimp Po Boy was very good.  Plenty of shrimp that was cooked well, nice and tender.  The topping of chili mayo added a lot of spiciness and some heat.  Enjoyed the pickle too.  Po Boy sandwiches can be so different and this is a pretty good rendition of a Po Boy.  Tasty Cajun Fries came with the Po Boy.",

    "text": "It's about time that Pittsburgh has a rockin' raw bar, and Muddy Waters does not disappoint. The ManBeast and I went to Muddy Waters for the first time last night to celebrate our first wedding anniversary. We managed to enjoy the last 30 minutes of their happy hour (which runs 4:30-6:30) -- $1 East Coast oysters (a featured oyster, presumably rotates), $2 West Coast oysters, $4 Cajun oyster shooters, $10 off bottles of bubbly, $20 off bottles of Champagne.  We happily took advantage and ordered 1/2 dozen East (James River), 1/2 dozen West (hama hama), a bottle of Prosecco, and two shooters.  OYSTERS: You either like oysters and you don't. The oysters are served with lemon and mignonette, with a trio of hot sauces if you're into that. Both the ManBeast and I preferred the James River -- large and sweet.  Neither one of us loved the mignonette, but I did enjoy the house-made bangin' pimento hot sauce. Nummy!  HAPPY HOUR: Awesome deals. Seriously. We both enjoyed the shooters, which tasted like a mini-Bloody Mary with a salty, gooey surprise in the bottom (an oyster, obvs). Made with red pepper vodka and a Cajun spiced rim.   DRINKS: We both tried a house special. I had the vieux carre, the ManBeast a Sazerac. Both drinks were delish and well-made.   STARTERS: We sampled the pork rinds (served with a delicious creole remoulade), deviled eggs, and pimento cheese.  Pork rinds?  Hard to go wrong.  The dipping sauce was particularly delish.  The deviled eggs were my favourite -- foie gras filling topped with smoked roe. Absolutely fabulous, and a terrific portion size for two people (4 whole, stuffed eggs, served with house-made pickled veggies).  My homemade Charleston pimento cheese is better than theirs, so I'd take a pass on that next time.  DINNER: The ManBeast was coming down with a cold, so we wound up getting a to-go po' boy. I opted for the gator with fried green tomatoes on the server's recommendation. Overall, I wouldn't get that again. The greens were FAR too bitter for my taste buds and turned me off from the entire sandwich, which I couldn't eat. The gator itself was quite good, though. Two of the fried green tomato slices were rock-hard in the center.   Normally, I would subtract a star for the disappointing sandwich, but the overall vibe of the place was so great, it compensates for this.  OVERALL: Awesome vibe. Can't wait to go back to hear the live music (although where the heck does the band play?! the place is tiny!) and sample some other offerings. Lively, although the PA music (heavily featuring Hendrix, which rocked) drowned out our ability to talk at a couple points.",

They had some cool Austin City Limits type music on the sound system, but two nights a week they do have live music in house for a two hour session.  My husband ordered a Jack's hard cider to drink, while I ordered an apple flavored drink named 'Don't you lie to me.' Both drinks were light and refreshing. We started with the cornbread which came with apple flavored butterjam. The two together were a burst of flavors and were delicious.  My husband ordered the hush puppies that were perfectly cooked, light and flavorful, while I ordered the chargrilled oysters. The oysters were more flavorful as they cooled down just a bit. I ordered an iceberg wedge, but did not care for their version of it.  For entrees, my husband got red beans, sausage and rice and I had the lobster roll with Cajun fries. It was the first time I've ever had lobster so I wish there wasn't any crawfish in there to muddle the flavor. The taste was mellow and pleasant and I got practically the entire thing to go since we were both stuffed.  The server was very professional and accommodating. All the employees were very nice. I would definitely like to visit again.",

    "text": "This is the first Oyster Bar we'd heard of in the Pittsburgh area after moving from Philly where we had lots of options, so my hubby and I have been really excited to try it. The reviews made use a little nervous that it might be overcrowded, over-priced, and noisy like some other place we've been recently (Yes, Industry, I'm still complaining about you!). I'm so glad we went anyway.   We went on a Friday night and had made reservations for 9pm, but ended up getting there shortly after 8:30pm. They were already rockin' but the host set us up immediately at the Oyster bar so we weren't standing around. Within minutes (and still early for our reservation), our waiter cleared off a table and seated us.   We forgot our waiter's name but he was wonderful. He was super knowledgeable about each oyster offering and the rest of the menu. We got the east-west sampler (6 of each for $38) which came quickly and was perfect. Our drinks were exactly as strong as we wanted them to be on a Friday evening and delicious. I got the \"I Mississippi You\" and the jalapeno off-set the blackberry perfectly. My husband loved his \"Clyde May's Sour\" as well.   Being hungry and the oyster lovers that we are, we then ordered the Chargrilled Oysters (another half-dozen). Buttery, garlicky, perfectly grilled, with just enough flavor that it added to the oysters without over-powering them. The hush puppies...oh my God. Perfectly fried, super flavorful, and I could have sucked down that sauce with a straw.   I chose the seafood gumbo for my entree. Now I've had the pleasure of spending time in New Orleans and have found myself disappointed by any northern recreations of food. Muddy Waters, however, did not miss the mark. Instead of giving me a bowl of rice with a little sauce and shrimp as most places do, I had a bowl full of shrimp, oysters, lobster, and okra in an amazing sauce. My husband went for the burger which he devoured before having a chance to tell me it was delicious.   Overall, the experience was fantastic and we can't wait to go back.",

The collards were too salty to eat even though they came highly recommended. The chargrilled oysters were probably the highlight of the evening. Cooked and seasoned perfectly.",

We got a mix of the east coast ($1) and west coast ($2) oysters, and they were both great. I think I would stick with the cheaper east coast oysters during future visits because they were equally as good as the west coast oysters.  We also ordered the seafood gumbo and cajun fries, but the waiter completely forgot about both of them. I told him and he soon brought the seafood gumbo, which was delicious especially on a cold day in Pittsburgh. But, he still forgot the cajun fries... and we were quite full, so I didn't even bother mentioning it again.  Besides my poor experience with the service, the food was amazing.  --  taste / 4 aesthetics / 4 vibe / 4 service / 1 price for quality / 4 OVERALL / 3.4",

We went with the well vodka for 8$ but they have cool house infused vodkas for 10$!  My boyfriend had the chicken and donut sandwich and destroyed it. He said it was the perfect amount of food for brunch! I had the shrimp po boy sandwich which was twice the size of the chicken and donut! I probably ate a third at brunch and the rest for post brunch meal and dinner   The atmosphere was pretty cool and the service was great! I recommend making a reservation for brunch because the seating is limited!",

We both started with the bloody mary bar, Titos for me, Old Bay vodka for him. We had a lot of fun building our bloody marys and we both ended up with pretty loaded glasses. So you know that is a sign of a good BM bar. I liked the pickled options, it was a nice addition to the saltiness of the drink. And their blood mary mix was sooo good!!   For an appetizer we got the fried green tomatoes that were cooked perfectly! The pimento cheese spread sealed the deal! Such a crunchy, savory bite!   I had the lobster roll because it was prepared just the way I like, with tons of butter. Lobster rolls made with mayo bases are for the birds! It was one of the best lobster rolls I've ever had. Perfect balance of everything and the lobster chunks were HUGE!!   Hubby got the fried shrimp po boy and loved it so much. The shrimp was \"fried\" perfectly. Not covered in a ton of breading, but still had amazing flavor.   We can't wait to go back for dinner sometime! Our only complaint and thing we'll do different is not having our waitress. She was pretty disengaged and didn't even explain the blood mary bar to us, or seem like she liked us. Can't win 'em all! :)",

For dinner I went with a nightly special that was recommended by my bartender. I am very glad I took his reco, it was my first time having grilled octopus as an entree. It came with 2 huge tentacles, dirty cheesy grits and okra. I cleaned my plate, it was incredible. The dirty cheesy grits had sausage, chicken livers and cheddar cheese. They had a nice beer selection as well as an interesting cocktail menu. I will definitely be back to try some of their Po Boys when I am back in town.",

Our waiter (I can't remember his name unfortunately) was really laid back, made good recommendations, and was attentive. The drinks were delicious. I went with a group of six and every person liked their drinks. I ordered one of their cocktails, again I can't remember the name, but it was so good. Our group ordered a bunch of appetizers including the cornbread, hush puppies, catfish, fried oysters, brussel sprouts, etc. and nothing bad could be said. I ordered the hot chicken, sampled the shrimp po' boy, the gumbo, and the shrimp and grits. It all was delicious. The hot chicken comes with sliced white bread just how my grandmother serves it (nice touch), and the sides were mouth watering.   I can honestly say that I was skeptical about this place based on the outward appearance, but I was pleasantly surprised. If I'm ever back in Pittsburgh I'll definitely have to come back.",

    "text": "AW SHUCKS, I could eat a whole bucket of oysters but this college student is on a budget so I might have to put that on hold till I enter the real world and start making some money to afford it all...  My friend and I came for Happy Hour on Wednesday around 4:30pm (when HH starts). We were seated right away and it didn't seem too busy yet at this time. The space seems a lot smaller than I thought but I think it's just a more narrow space than most restaurants. It's a bit dim inside but there is this one row of seating right at the back where a window of natural lighting shines in from the top so we were seated there. Also, the music can get a little bit too loud and I think if it were the weekend it'll get pretty crowded. Probably a good place to come after a work day to just chill with coworkers or friends.  For the Happy Hour Oysters, you have to order in batches of 6. The first batch of 12 that we ordered were both from the East Coast - half Delaware Bay and half Half Moon. The Delaware Bay oysters are still $1 for HH but the rest of the east coast oysters raised to $2 I believe (as well as the west coast oysters). The Delaware Bay tasted clean and a little more bland than the other types of oysters we tried. I think that you would need the mignonette or some hot sauce to give the Delaware Bay more flavor. But for the Half Moon, the bit of the saltiness that it already had didn't call for any additional toppings. We weren't satisfied with eating just 6 oysters each, so we ordered 6 more but this time from the West Coast - KUMIAI. I would say this was the best one out of the three types we tried. It had the perfect amount of flavoring and balance of taste. And it was a little more \"plump,\" as the menu described.   In addition to the oysters, we ordered the Louisiana Lobster Roll Sandwich, which came with cajun fries. This was my first time having a lobster roll... To my surprise the sandwich was a lot more buttery than I was expecting? Like the bread seemed drenched with butter... I think it would've been better to my liking if it wasn't all overwhelming with butter but the lobster tasted yummy:) The fries that came with the sandwich were quite soggy... didn't taste freshly made. Also I don't think the cajun seasoning was on them because it just tasted like regular fries.. hmm.. we didn't bother telling them but might want to check on that the next time.   Overall, I had a good experience and would come back for the oysters!",

    "text": "Pros: At $8, the Bloody Mary bar was a steal. There's a nice variety on the menu, although once you add raw oysters (or another appetizer) + a drink + plus an entree, the price is easily more than $30 per person, which is more than I want to spend on lunch. The grilled oysters my friend's friend had looked delicious. My partner appreciated that the fruit salad that came with his chicken sandwich had actual fresh fruit and berries rather than merely cantaloup and honeydew.  Cons: The strawberry vinaigrette on the pecan salad was an unnatural shade of washed-out pink (perhaps a personal quirk of mine). The music was too loud for easy conversation. The waitress disappeared while we eating, making drink refills difficult, and she then tried to clear my plate before I was finished with the fixings on my Bloody Mary.  Verdict: We'll come back, but only for special occasions or with guests.",

The fried green tomatoes were well cooked but the star was the pimento cheese spread. The oysters tasted fresh, clean, and the sampler offered a great variety of flavors from sweet and delicate to more brackish and meaty. It also included 3 mignonettes. The jalapeno one was excellent.   I had the Louisiana lobster roll and fries. Unbelievably delicious. The rest of the table got po boys and were very happy.

    "text": "I love it here. Seriously. I love the place, I love the food, I love the staff, I love the drinks (except for the hurricane, too sweet). This is a great place to come for happy hour or for dinner. Parking is on the street which can be sometimes annoying but it has not ever been a huge problem. Even on the Yelp app you can make a reservation, which I would say to do just because the place is not huge. I like to sit at the booths in the back but there are spaces at the bar and high top tables. I just prefer a seat that is comfortable and a little more intimate.   I love Cajun and Creole food. Anything that has a bit of spice and seafood is good in my book. And oysters are my all time favorite. I could eat those little morsels every day of the week.  I came for a tasting party once and then for happy hour. So I am trying to write about both of my experiences with the food. Honestly, they were both great so...its hard not to like the menu, people, service, and ambiance.   Oysters: JAMES RIVER: Cherrystone Aqua Farms (Chincoteague, VA). These are my favorite of all of the oysters that I have tried. Not briny at all. Very smooth, plump, and full of flavor. I am not a fan of the briny oysters so this one was a great choice.   CHARGRILLED OYSTERS: Garlic Butter, Parmesan, Chili Flakes. Yum. A little bit of spice and a little bit of cheese. These went down really well. I thought that maybe the cheese made the oyster a little salty, but overall delish.   OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER:Greens, Bacon, Parmesan, Absinthe. Really good dish too. The bacon was cut into bigger chunks than I would have liked and because of that it was extra crunchy and more noticeable. I would have liked to have it mix a bit more with the dish, but it was still really good.   Appetizers:  BLACK TRUFFLE HUSH PUPPIES:Mushroom Duexelle, Black Truffle, Fresh Herbs, Black Garlic Remoulade. These are AMAZING. Seriously. I cannot talk about how great these were. The taste was so unlike any other hush puppy I had ever had. I would get these all day long. The black garlic remoulade was also something interesting and delicious.   Main Course:  SEAFOOD GUMBO: Lobster, Shrimp, Crawfish, Oysters,Rice, Andouille Sausage, Okra. Just get this. It was delicious. I loved the mixture of the seafood with the taste of the gumbo. I have never had that much seafood in my gumbo and I am a changed person because of it! Yummy!  PO BOY: Your choice of Fried Shrimp or Oysters, Iceberg, Tomato, Pickle,Chili Mayo. I tried both the fried shrimp and the fried oyster po boy. Both were great. I enjoyed the Oyster one a bit more but that is only because I love oysters. I thought it was fried to perfection and the oysters were still plump and juicy on the inside.   LOUISIANA LOBSTER ROLL: Maine Lobster & Crawfish, Garlic Butter, Lemon, Split Top Roll. This was awesome. Really, really good. Not a lot of filler in this. I would say that I did add a little bit of the hot sauce to give it more of a kick. But other than that I would get this again for sure.   Drinks:  DON'T YOU LIE TO ME: Vodka, Green Apple, Lemon, Vanilla Beans. Go straight to this drink. Do not pass it up. I would bathe in this drink if appropriate! It is just so refreshing and great!  Go to Muddy Waters!! Take your family and friends. It is totally worth it! Splurge and go have some fun!",

I'm a person who, when trying new oysters, doesn't use cocktail sauce or vinegar. The quality was fantastic and we were told the oysters are shipped in directly from the source (opposed to a third party or middle man). You can sit outside at the bar top which is nice on a hot summer day. Louisiana po boy with gator was off the hook, also recommended by our server. Very non pretentious, laid back place.",

    "text": "Being a native New Englander, I am not one to mess around with my seafood.  If it ain't fresh, I won't eat it.  Sadly that means I don't eat much seafood in the Steel City.    Then I heard about Muddy Waters and how their oysters are brought in fresh from East and West Coasts.  I was intrigued.  I figured these were either going to be delicious or they're going to be a fishy tasting mess... Thank goodness for delicious!  When you arrive, the staff will educate you about the difference between East Coast (briny) and West Coast (silky) oysters.  You can have them raw (YES) or char-grilled.  As they say - they're \"bad ass mother shuckers\" - and they're not kidding!  Slurp down some oysters plain, with hot sauce, or with their pickling liquid they serve with it (it's incredible).  Looking for something more than oysters?  Try their Hot Chicken with creamy collard greens and cheese grits or the BBQ shrimp and grits (yes, whole shrimp).  For an app try the cornbread with apple butter (you'll thank me later).  Whatever fills your belly, wash it down with a DELICIOUS adult beverage.  Try all of their specialty drinks - I am working my way down the list (responsively) and they are tasty.  Whether it's freshly muddled berries or shaken with egg whites (it sounds weird, but trust me it's good), they don't mess around with their beverage!  Next time I'm craving a killer cocktail or the taste of home, I'll be heading to Muddy Waters.  Oysters here I come!",

We started with some appetizers and chose the deviled eggs the were accompanied by some spicy pickles and green beans. They were amazing and one of our favorite items if the night. We also ordered the pimento cheese appetizer which was a bit spicy but uniquely delicious.  For our entrees we chose the lobster roll with Cajun fries and the whole snapper with veggie hash. The lobster roll had not only lobster, but also shrimp and crawfish. The seafood was very tasty, but the roll was hard and chewy and got tossed to the side. The whole snapper was presented beautifully on the plate with the veggie hash. The hash was very good but I felt the fish needed a bit more flavor. After carefully removing the inedible parts and bones, I mixed the fish with the hash and some Crystal hot sauce and it was quite enjoyable. However, I probably wouldn't order it again as it was a bit of work and there are too many other items I would want to try first.   Our server was very friendly and we chatted throughout the evening about good food locations all over the country. Our server was helpful and efficient from beginning to end.  In summary, this was a good meal but not quite the level of New Orleans cuisine we are accustomed to. But this is probably as close as we can get right now in the Burg, so we will take it!",

If you've ever been to New Orleans, Lake Charles or even Shreveport Louisiana for that matter you won't like the food you will love the food at Muddy Waters.  The chef has a very good take on the coastal influence of Louisiana cuisine. Fresh oysters, po boys, gumbo and lots yummy strong drinks.  We had the pork rind appetizer that was a good blend of salty zesty and just plain guilty fun. We also enjoyed a shrimp Po boy in Cajun fries just enough heat to let it linger and makes you want to drink all the water in your glass. Do not miss the Two ton Feather so smooth it could be dangerous. Will be returning for that awesome looking gumbo and steak.",

My wife order lobster benedict and we got lobster roll in stead. The waitress (a girl with brown hair and tattoo) did not apologize at all. She just simply took away the food with a cold face and said she will ask the kitchen to fix it. When she brought the food back out, it was correct even though my steak became medium-cooked.  Still recommend to go here but avoid that waitress!",

    "text": "My dining experience at Muddy Waters was just what the doctor ordered. I had a wonderful relaxing time slowly going through an approximately 3 course meal with my boyfriend. We went here on a Friday night at 5:45pm (we had a reservation). When we arrived it wasn't packed; however, I believe most of the people dining throughout the night had reservations. I could not wait to dine here, because I had experienced a taste of the place at a yelp event in 2016.   We explored the happy hour by ordering two Don Waynes (a happy hour cocktail) which has ginger and was very delicious. We started with Oyster's Rockefeller which remind me of an escargot dish. They are cooked oysters with tons of fixings and a slight kick. Then we had the raw oysters. First we tried the James River oysters which were a dollar a piece. Then we tried the Emerald Cove oysters which were 2 bucks a piece. I preferred the James River; however, the Emerald Cove are very creamy.   My boyfriend had the Gator Sausage Gumbo. This had a pretty nice kick and the gator was melt away tender!. He also had the Oyster PO-boy which was a very large sandwich that came with fries. My man raved about the fries and claims they are the best he has ever tried.   I had the Shrimp and grits which was spicier than my ideal preference but delicious nonetheless. The grits were very creamy and helped cut the cajun flavors of the sauce. The shrimp were really jumbo jumbo full prawns. This meal is super messy and definitely not good for a first date. The prawns are not cleaned, they have a face and everything, so most of your time is spent trying to get to the meat.   This whole dining experience plus tip was around $116. So I would consider this place pretty pricey but definitely a good treat on occasions.",

Everyone loved the hush puppies we ordered.  We also got chargrilled oysters with butter and garlic but I actually liked the fresh oysters better, I thought the grill taste over powered them.  For dinner I had fried chicken, it was unlike any chicken I've ever had. They dip it in hot sauce and then batter and fry it, it had so much flavor.  It came with cheddar grits, collard greens and a biscuit.  It was all really good.  My friend had the gator bites, I wouldn't get those, nothing special.  The other 2 people got lobster rolls and they had a ton of meat in them, they both said they were really good.  Got beignets for dessert, how could fried dough not be good.  I didn't love the chocolate sauce it came with, too bitter.  Would definitely go again!",

We ordered oysters and lobster, and both were so tasty and fresh. I ordered some type of lobster that came in a jar and there is a remoulade sauce that was out-of-this-world-to-die-for. Honestly, I could have just eaten it with a spoon. My husband particularly enjoyed one type of oyster from Maine, which I think was called the Bayloon oyster(? that's probably wrong, though),  which are only available one month out of the year. They were enormous and extremely fresh. My husband thought they were the best tasting oysters he ever had. We also met the owners at one point, who were very friendly.   The most challenging part about eating here was, (besides knowing when to stop eating), was finding parking. In fact, this is the main reason we missed out on brunch (it ended at 2pm).

    "text": "Fantastic! A gem!  When we walked in, we notice a nice bourbon selection. Upon further review, they had Pappy Van Winkle 20 year at $75 for an ounce. A great price especially compared to Butcher and the Rye at about $250 an ounce.  Our waiter, Kieran, was awesome as was the bartender behind the bar. We ordered the East and West Coast oysters which were excellent and described perfectly on the menu. We also had the Jambalaya for 2 which was awesome and had perfect heat to the dish. The Jambalaya was also a perfect portion for the both of us. We had beignets for dessert. 5 pieces and delicious. After our shots of Pappy and excellent Manhattans made by Kieran plus a special extra, we had an excellent evening of food, drink, service and atmosphere. I have been to New Orleans on numerous occasions and Muddy Waters  is the best New Orleans style restaurant in Pittsburgh hands down. Great prices! Fantastic!  Thank you Muddy Waters for making a birthday celebration so special. (They didn't know it was my birthday)  We will definitely be back!!",

    "text": "Came here on a Sunday for Brunch twice, and I am a fan!  If you like oysters, this is the place for you.  My first time I came I ordered a nice spread of oysters from the East and West coast... I'm a fan of the oysters with more brine (keepin' it salty).  I personally felt the more expensive the oyster the better it tasted.  The cheaper oysters didn't taste bad though!  I've also had the chargrilled oysters and they have a nice garlic and butter taste.... Mmmmm Mmmm!  The first reason I gave it a 4/5 was because my bread wasn't toasted/chargrilled with butter for the chargrilled oysters like the photos on Yelp.  I think that would have actually added value because we just had a chunk of French bread.  The oysters were delicious though.  I ordered the country breakfast (traditional style): Eggs (your way), Grits, Meat (Bacon/Sausage/etc), Bread (biscuits/toast/etc).  It was tasty.  Their grits are super cheesy and buttery - yes, yes, yes!  They were almost like my mom used to make them back in the day.  My husband ordered the fried chicken and biscuits, and that was pretty tasty too.   If you like a good Bloody Mary Bar I believe that is their signature cocktail for brunch. They even have a mix of infusions to change up the base vodka flavor (and you can try it with tequila).  I am not a fan of them unless I have a hangover (don't judge! I've been good lately).  I noticed a lot of other tables ordered them so it must be decent.  The second reason I gave it a 4/5 is their mimosas are just \"ok\".  I'd give the mimosa a 3 out of 5. I prefer my mimosa to have a glass of champagne and a splash of orange juice to still be able to taste the fizz of the champagne. It shouldn't be opaque dark orange.  They're personally put too much orange juice for me (the ratio of orange juice to champagne just didn't hit the spot) and I don't believe the orange juice was fresh squeezed.  Just to make sure I wasn't crazy I went down the street to another bar and had a fresh squeeze orange juice mimosa and almost squealed with delight.  Anywho... Back to Muddy Waters Oyster Bar... They measure the champagne in a beaker first and then put the orange juice in.  Next time, I'm going to ask for a glass of champagne and ask for a shot of OJ instead.  I hope they improve the process because I love brunch and a good mimosa is a part of it.  The venue is a bit small, so definitely make reservations... Since you can do it online, why wouldn't you?  We made reservations in route just to make sure we were going to get a seat, but we ended up eating at the bar to get a view of the TV to watch football.  I'm going to have to come back for Happy Hour!",

Others who for oysters (some are $1 ea during happy hour!) said they were awesome. I got the burger... Oh my god. It had 2 parties, bacon, a fried green tomato, a fried egg, pickles, spicy mayo, and who knows what else on some kind of bangin bun (challah maybe?). SO GOOD. Cocktails were also good. No beers on tap and no happy hour drink specials were not so good. It was obvious that the staff was new- getting a drink was a major challenge at times.  We'll be back, hopefully to report equally delicious food and better service.",

Caught off guard (who requires brunch reservations in Pittsburgh?) my sister and I replied no. The host informed us that they were booked but we could try to get a seat at the bar. Holding out hope, my sister and I only had to wait about 10 minutes for a couple to leave the bar to grab seats. So glad we were not swayed by the host's pessimistic outlook and decided to wait it out.   Everything on the menu looked great but I chose the shrimp and grits and my sister chose the bananas foster French toast. The shrimp and grits was delicious-3 huge whole prawns in a delicious BBQ sauce with rich grits and andouille. I tried my sisters French toast which was great-not overly sweet.   I will definitely be back to try the dinner menu but perhaps give them some time to work out the service kinks. The kitchen was on point with turning out great food in a timely fashion-the servers and hosts just need to catch up.",

The oysters I assume tasted how oysters should we had some of the east coast varieties on the happy hour menu and they tasted like \"ocean\" but since it was my first time having oysters I won't make that my key critique. I was however quite disappointed in the seafood gumbo. The price met the size of the plate but the taste hardly touched the Cajun experience I was looking for and I suspect, if you're looking for spice, you'll be sorely disappointed. I will say, however, that there is a pretty good amount of meat and all of it was pretty tasty. My friend had the BBQ shrimp and grits which were also \"okay\" but be prepared for what \"head on shell on\" really means, unless you're ready to eat it that way, some prep comes with the meal. Wait staff was reasonably attentive and did a nice job describing the oyster varieties but the overall service experience was nothing special. Depending on your expectations this place really might not be worth the price.",

When I spoke to the waiter he told me he'd speak to the manager but nothing came of it. I closed my bill and left and do not recommend that anyone eats here.",

My favorites : west coast oysters, shrimp cocktail , lobster roll, shargrilled oysters , BBQ shrimp and grits  and of course pecan pie as a dessert ( it's awesome!) and Rye Marple Fizz cocktail ( best ever!)",
