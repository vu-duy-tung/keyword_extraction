General Tso's Chicken had so many hot peppers in it that it wasn't edible..I love hot food but this was really overwhelming.  The Szechuan Shrimp was equally as hot on another order and tonight I played it safe and ordered Shrimp Chop Suey..mostly broccoli on the veggie part and the sauce was watery like soup..Don't think I'll be ordering takeout from there anymore!  On the upside their Sushi is exceptionally good according to my Sushi loving husband. Guess he will be dining alone if he wants Chinese takeout!",

The owners definitely paid attention to the small details from the cute tea cups to the nice placemats.  As for the food, everything that we ordered was delicious.  I really enjoyed the Shanghai bok choy that was lightly sauteed.  As the previous Yelper said, the food was not too greasy.  Also, the flavors fit the taste of my parents, who are originally from Hong Kong and Canton, China.  I would recommend this place to friends and family.  Unfortunately, I live in Boston, so I cannot come as often as I would like.  However, when I do come back, this will be a place I will request to go out for dinner, whenever I come home to visit my parents.  I hope this place does well, as it just opened up.  The owners are very nice people!    Give this place a try!",

The General Tsos is very good, the Hunan chicken was also good, though a by salty. However, I must say that I am not impressed by their new staff. I was very pleased to see that the restaurant was 3/4 full (the busiest I've seen it).  We walked in and the hostess asked if we wanted a table or booth. I requested a booth. We walked to the back (past an empty booth and one that was empty and just needed cleaned) and the hostess turned around and told us that there were no empty booths and we had to sit at a table. I looked to the other side of the restaurant to see at least one more empty booth. She couldn't have missed them, how could she have said that with a straight face?! Was she just trying to get her friend tips by seating us in her section? I just wanted to eat in peace, so didn't challenge her. Our waitress was polite, but inattentive. She disappeared and when she was around she was so quiet that neither of us could hear a word that she was saying.  The staff has typically been great, but the new additions don't do this place justice.  Seriously, don't tell your customers that there are no empty booths when it is very obviously not True. We aren't stupid.",

Sadly, the place has lost quality, quantity, and friendliness... Three attributes that used to make this place my family's favorite dining spot. We would go three times a week some weeks. They used to give enormous portions of everything. Something must have happened because suddenly we would go and we'd get these tiny plates. I used to enjoy their Triple Delight. Then they got extremely stingy with their portions. I would spend over 20 dollars on my meal and leave still hungry. I would tell myself that I am still getting quality food. Then their chicken became more and more fatty and gummy. Then I would go because my family became close to the wait staff and owners. Now I rarely see the owners and all of the waitresses we liked are either gone already or are leaving soon. The current wait staff doesn't know the menu and can't understand English. Plus they have a tendency of being downright rude.   My family has already jumped ship and we've started giving other places our business.",

My husband ordered the bride and groom platter and he loved it. I ordered the shrimp pad thai and received a huge portion at a decent price. They give you a ton of good sized shrimp in the pad thai too-not the small itty bitty ones you often see. The Rice Inn offers Chinese, Japanese, and Thai.

    "text": "I have a simple litmus test for Chinese restaurants, and it comes as a result of my 30 years of experience of eating at Chinese restaurants all over the U.S. (mainly California) and in mainland China.  My test?  \"Kung Pao Chicken.\"  It's always the first thing I try at a Chinese restaurant, because I have experienced Kung Pao Nirvana, and I have had way too many disappointments.  A disappointing Kung Pao experience usually leads to \"no second chance\" from me because there are choices one can make.  When I saw the \"grand opening\" signs for Rice Inn at the old Pizza Hut location next to Walmart in Bethel Park, I didn't want to get my hopes up.  I actually waited until I saw a couple of Yelp and Urbanspoon reviews before I decided to get my dining partner to join me for a meal there.  (you can't be too careful these days...)  My first impression was, \"HEY, they've actually dressed up this old Pizza Hut pretty well!\"  They even managed to do something with those weird trapezoid Pizza Hut windows that we all know and love.  The place was simply decorated, and was very inviting to the first-time guest.  (maybe the odd familiarity added to that?)  Comfortable seating, low noise level, attentive hostess (who turned out to be the manager) and an eager young waiter all made us feel good about our choice to try Rice Inn from the very start.  The first thing we noticed on the menu were the letters \"BYOB.\"  We immediately sent our young accomplice to the nearby Giant Eagle to procure some bottles for us.  I simply love the whole BYOB concept, especially when there is no \"corkage\" fee.  Upon opening the menu, I was impressed with the depth that it contained, and since I had read that this new restaurant had good sushi, I ordered the \"Baked Alaska Roll\" as an appetizer.  I am unable to resist any roll that has smoked salmon on it, and this one did not disappoint.  It was expertly prepared, very well presented, and the ingredients seemed fresh and tasted delicious.  The only bad part was that it was cut into 8 pieces and there were 3 of us, so I had to graciously (and reluctantly) deny myself a third piece!  This was an odd roll, because as the name implied, it was served warm.  But I really, really liked it, and so did my compatriots. (who got 3 pieces, unlike me...)  I was feeling great about this place almost immediately because we got to watch the sushi chef prepare our roll, and we got to drink exactly the beer that we wanted (Yakima Glory) instead of settling for the usual run-of-the-mill Chinese restaurant offering.  We decided to try a nice cross-section from the menu to find out where the strengths and weakness might be.  We ordered a seafood soup for two, an order of Kung Pao chicken with fried rice (only 75 cents to upgrade from the steamed rice) and an order of Pad Thai, of which we are huge fans.  In a word, the Kung Pao chicken was \"perfect.\"  This is the dish that always lights me up when it is done correctly, and the kitchen at RICE INN nailed this one.  Tender, perfectly cooked chicken, crispy texture in the vegetables and nuts, and a sauce that was exactly what I was hoping for.  A++ and the best I've had in the South Hills of Pittsburgh.  The seafood soup got a B minus.  Everything was in there as advertised, and nothing in the soup was overdone or tough.  Obviously the kitchen used fresh ingredients.  But personally, I thought that the soup itself was somewhat lacking in seasoning and overall seafood taste.  This may be a personal taste thing, but I wasn't that excited about the soup.  My friends, however, enjoyed it more than I.  As for the Pad Thai, it was not what I was expecting.  I have had a lot of GREAT Pad Thai lately because this is one of the major strengths of one of my favorite restaurants located a few miles up the road on 88.  This Pad Thai needed to go back to the drawing board, in my opinion.  The shrimp was tender enough, and the rice noodles were just about right, but the seasoning of this dish just didn't do justice to the Pad Thai tradition.  After offering some feedback to our young and enthusiastic waiter, \"Morgan,\" I wouldn't be surprised if the chef made some adjustments on this particular menu offering.  It's hard to do EVERYTHING well, and since this place has only been in business for a month, I'll expect some improvements on this one.  My overall impression could be summed up in these words:  \"Do you have any TO-GO menus?\"  I will definitely be coming back to RICE INN to explore the menu further and find out what other offerings on the menu are \"in their wheelhouse.\"  It will not surprise me to find out that they do a lot of things well, based on this first visit.  I'd also like to make mention of the fact that the hostess who turned out to be the manager listened to the feedback we gave our young waiter on the food we were served, and she unhesitatingly removed the cost of the Pad Thai from our bill without any suggestion from us.  I really respect this desire to please!",

Tables all around us that were seated after us received their food and we still sat waiting.  This happened a couple months ago and we just left.  We tried it again tonight hoping to give them another chance and the service was no better.  What irritated me the most is when my husband called the manager over she didn't really seem to care",

Steak (real steak, slightly rare in the middle), chicken, and shrimp. Perfectly cooked vegetables (pea pods, baby corn, broccoli, carrots, water chestnuts, cabbage).  And their cheese filled wontons(crab Rangoon)..amazing!  The amazing chicken, general tsos, and sesame chicken all blow Sesame Inn out of the water.  And its not as pricy.   We used to have to drive all the way out to bean curd in McMurray for decent Chinese. So happy we have rice inn now. (Plus our favorite bean curd waiter works here too!)  They get to know their regulars and anticipate your order. Love their servers!  EDITING TO ADD: the Pad Thai is addictive!! I've ordered it the past 3 times and keep going back for it. New favorite. :).",

    "text": "We moved to Bethel Park from the SF Bay area and have been feverishly searching for good authentic Chinese takeout.  We would normally have this a couple times a month, as everyone in our family LOVES Chinese food.  After trying a few other places that were a little further drive we landed at Rice Inn.  It is a short drive from our home, but the pricing is VERY expensive and the food was just OK.   The walnut prawns are drowned in  honey sauce making them all sorts of soggy and not appetizing.  Today, we had takeout and when we placed the order on the phone, the girl read it back correctly.  After I got home and unpacked dinner I realized that we were missing chicken fried rice and that we had ordered 2 \"orders\" of egg rolls and only had 2 egg rolls (which hardly qualifies as an order-BTW each egg roll is $2.25 LOL!)  When we called to question our order they said that they didn't add the fried rice, nor did they charge us for it but they offered to deliver an order complimentary since they had screwed up.  Our order for veggie dish, noodle dish, shrimp, chicken dish, pot stickers was over $70 too.  When the delivery lady came she wanted $10, we explained what happened and she said she needed $10 in order to give us the rice.  I asked her what she was going to do with it and she said take it back to the restaurant . . . to reuse in someone else's dish??? IDK, but makes you wonder.  Anyway, needless to say not going back to Rice Inn for the overpriced mediocre food.  Back to the drawing board!",

One of my favorite things about Rice Inn is that they deliver locally, and the food doesn't have that \"been sitting in the car for half an hour\" taste. It tastes as fresh as if it was right from the kitchen even when delivered. They are also BYOB so you could bring a six-pack or a bottle of wine to the restaurant. The crab rangoons are also a staple. One thing to consider if you've never eaten here are the portions - they are gigantic. Myself, my wife, and both my parents recently ate from one portion of General Tso's chicken and were all satisfied!",

The waitress recommended it as sashimi (no rice) instead of sushi (on rice), so I went with her suggestion. It came in a cute little cucumber cup!  The Thai dishes could definitely be spicier. I asked for very spicy Mussaman curry--a 7 out of 10, and requested extra spice on the side. She said it's incorporated in the dish, so there wasn't an option for the spice to be on the side. It came out as a huge portion with red pepper flakes, but there was absolutely no spice in this chicken curry ):  It might have scored it a 2/10 on the spice scale. On the bright side, It had plenty of flavor from the curry sauce, the green beans, potatoes, onions, and pineapples.  Brown rice was an extra 50 cents, which is cheap compared to the +$2 markup at other restaurants.   I was looking for dinner in the area, and I found Rice Inn through Yelp. It's a little out of the way for me, so I might not get a chance to come back-- but I'd recommend this place to others.",

We had a curry dish and a noodle dish and both were super bland, for the $40 it cost for 2 dishes I didn't feel it was worth it. Curries are usually full of flavor, this just lacked any real taste. The noodles were dry and bland and everything seemed steamed without any seasoning. Little disappointing.",

After a bunch or arguing back and forth and her refusing to take my plate back, my grandmother agreed to take my food and I took her chicken lomein. When I got home after lunch, I ended up having a allergic reaction and my throat swelled. This tells me they cross contaminated. I will NEVER go back to this restaurant. Terrible customer service.",

    "text": "\"No, that couldn't be,\" I said to myself earlier in the year when I noticed that the Bethel Park Pizza Hut had been converted into... an Asian restaurant? That would mean...sushi in Bethel Park???   2 nights ago on dreaded Black Friday, Kay and I were driving along cozy Library Road aimlessly when I suddenly remembered that relatively recent development and charged forward.   Like Bigfoot, Kay didn't believe it existed.  \"It used to be a Pizza Hut?\" she asked with the tone of a skeptical police officer interrogating a UFO eyewitness.   \"Yes! Keep going! It's there! It's there! I know I saw it! I read reviews on Yelp,\" I replied.  \"What's the name again?\" she inquired.   \"Rice Inn.\"  \"Ricin? Eeeeww. That's a poison!\"  \"Oh, stop.\"  \"Well, they at least better be open or else...it's a date with The Redhead,\" Kay coldly promised.   Sure enough at 8PM on a weekend, Rice Inn's doors were unlocked. The interiors are sparse but tasteful with vibrant, upside down glasses housing the light bulbs. Bourdain's new CNN program was running on a flatscreen telly near a sushi bar.   A complimentary serving of Edamame was the precursor to our supper. Salted and bulbous, I'd never had these soybeans served to me in this manner before. At first I ate them whole! That is until I realized that I had better tasting results when I popped open each pod to get at the nutty, wholesome beans within.   I officially began my journey into the inexplicable with a pair of Uni or Sushi with Sea Urchin for the novices among thee. The quivering, ornately presented cylinders of seaweed, rice, and a paste-like roe were bedecked with fanned cucumber. When placed whole in my mouth, what I tasted amidst each opulent morsel's inherently sensual texture were the faint whispers of caviar, foie gras, oyster, and thus...the ocean. This wasn't an appetizer; this was a seduction. The glob of wasabi remained untouched, but the flower of shaved, pickled ginger (I've a soft spot for it) I ate only after I finished the sushi.   6 swelling, humongous fried pork dumplings came next. Abundant with ground meat filling and golden brown on the outside, had I not shared them with Kay, I could have made them my entree. The balls of savory minced pig stayed within each potsticker, which required knife, fork, and at least two bites to consume wholly. In all seriousness, Rice Inn's dumplings are the largest specimen of this perennial Chinese favorite I've ever experienced, and they alone make a trek to the far South Hills worthwhile.   Based solely on its fanciful, poetic name, I chose a main dish that fell under the Thai heading. Dancing Seafood Supreme was composed of jumbo shrimp, sea scallops, crabmeat, tomatoes, onion, peppers, carrot, basil, and \"chef's special spicy Thai chili sauce\" as stated in the pamphlet I took home. The sauce was only warmly spicy and never overthrew the majesty that was the pleasingly plump and abundant bits of crustacean and mollusk. The tatty and tart tomato pieces were a welcome surprise and fleetingly fooled me into thinking I was eating an Italian stew made with the day's fresh catch.   After barely finishing each of our big-hearted portions, we bade our trusty server Celine along with the rest of the buoyant staff farewell and headed back home without having bought a single damn thing on this damnably consumerist holiday other than a wondrous Asian supper at a family-owned establishment.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I was surprised to know that this restaurant even existed, like I'm such a huge fan of Asian cuisine to where I was shocked I hadn't heard of this place especially seeings as how close it is to me. We took a visit down to Rice Inn and upon entering we were greeted by a friendly Asian waitress (no surprise there) and she sat us down and almost immediately asked what we wanted to drink. Now it seems they have a thing with tea seeings as how she brought a cast iron pot over and started by pouring us mugs of it (upon request of course as she asked if we would like tea) and I will say it was quite good. Our first thoughts were on the decor, it was quite dated but oddly nostalgic. The reason for this come to find was that the place was built inside of an old Pizza Hut that closed down about 5-6 years ago. As for our waitress she spoke English but her accent at times was a bit hard to grasp and did happen to cause a misunderstanding about our leftovers being boxed. But nonetheless she was very attentive and respondent. After placing our orders the food was shockingly on the table in under 3 minutes! Albeit the place was a ghost town as there were about 4-5 other customers in the entire building, but still fast nonetheless. My sushi was pretty good although I didn't fancy the chewy salmon in my salmon roll. The California roll was about as good as a California roll can be so that was nice. The fantastic roll was oddly warm on top but I found I kind of liked it as it added some depth to the mouthfeel. And the ginger salad on the side did not look very visually appealing but tasted decent, I would go for the wanton soup as a side if I ever went again though (I most likely will). And as for the person I was with they got the sesame chicken with white rice and wanton soup as a side. They said that the rice was perfect but the chicken had an odd texture and it was much too sweat. They gave the wanton soup rave reviews however. I also ordered a takeout of orange chicken with white rice for one of my family members and they even said it was getting hard to eat it near the end seeings as how sweet it was, they compared it to panda expresses orange chicken saying it's about 5x sweeter and not nearly as good. I would recommend sticking to Japanese food if you plan a visit. Overall my experience was a good one and I recommend it to any hardcore fish fans in the area. 3/5",

With that said, it was packaged adorably. There were these little tins for mixing the wasabi and soy, and they send the food with an ice pack to ensure quality. They take pride in their product clearly, also, the girls who handled my take out were very friendly and helpful. We will be back for sure! You should try this place!!!!",

I was heading to Pleasant Hills but remembered this place in Bethel Park, I just didn't feel like driving all the way over there.    Rice Inn was clean. We were greeted as we walked in the door.  We were greeted with a smile.  We were seated and given the lunch menu's.  I ordered the General Tso's chicken with fried rice and wonton soup.  My lunch mate ordered Sweet n sour shrimp, fried rice and egg roll.  The soup and egg roll came first.  The soup was excellent.  The best I had ever had.  They give 2 wontons and the broth, mixed with cabbage.  I highly rated this a 10.  The egg roll was good.  Wasn't greasy.  The lunch dishes were served after we finished the soup and egg roll.  They waited for a while for us to eat it.  General Tso's was really saucy, the chicken was crisp and was on the sweet side.  I never had anything like this before.  It was different from other places, but it was good.  I rated that a 10 also.  However, I think they could give a little bit more rice with the meal.  It was 7.00 for Lunch and my partner paid 8.00.  The sweet n sour shrimp was good also as it was served with the sauce on the meat, with peppers, onions and pineapple.  I didn't try it but it did look spectacular. He also said it was really good.    the prices for dinner are on the high side.  I don't think I will be going there for dinner.  We will just keep it short and sweet with lunch.    Give it a try if you haven't tried the place.  We really did enjoy it and I was full when I left.  Not stuffed but just right.",

Saturated.  My General Tso's Chicken was okay, not bad at all, but didn't really taste like I expected.  It was sweet, not at all spicy, and tasted like a few spices or ingredients were missing.  So, again, this place is not bad, it's not not real good, and I know of better choices.",

I hadn't been here in a really long time, so I decided to stop in today for lunch.  Formerly a Pizza Hut, it is now an Asian restaurant with Chinese, Sushi, and Thai.  I always get the Thai lunch special, and always the same one, Green Curry Vegetables.  You get a choice of soup or an eggroll, and I always get the veggie egg roll.  I like the green curry, and the purple eggplants that are in it are my favorite part of the dish.  It also has green beans, carrots, broccoli, a few jalapenos, and fresh basil.  Is it the best I have ever had?  No, not even close, but it is fine for what it is, and the staff here are always very friendly.  And lunch is just under $10.",

And so many different types of sushi. The rice inn roll, mango roll, and eel roll are 3 of my favorites. Also pictured below! The service is always so friendly, and the prices aren't bad, especially for lunch. I'll be sad when I move out of this neighborhood and no longer have sushi less than a mile from me! Can't wait for my next trip or call in order to rice inn!",

I was hesitant to try Rice Inn because I already had a go to Chinese place, but many friends liked it and I was craving Pad Thai and they had a lunch special that included Pad Thai. I threw caution to the wind and went for it one afternoon for lunch. I ordered both Pad Thai with chicken and a Szechuan Chicken with steamed rice so my dining partner and I could try a little each.   The portion size was really generous on both. The Pad Thai was a little more saucy than I'm used to and was a different color than I'm accustomed, but it was pretty good and satisfied a craving. The meat was very good. Thinly sliced chicken breast was cooked perfectly. The dish had a pleasant spice level, too. I could have used a little more bean sprouts in the dish, but the snow peas were an interesting addition.   The Szechuan chicken was also good. Again, great quality meat- no gristle and mystery pieces here! I should have asked about the vegetables that were included because this one had a lot of bell pepper which I don't really care for. That's not their fault, I forgot to ask. There were bamboo shoots and carrots, too. All in all, a good dish.   I'd definitely go back to try a few other things. They have sushi and a few other Thai offerings, mostly curries.   The place is a converted Pizza Hut building, and nothing fancy, but it was clean, bustling like you'd hope at lunch time, and very pleasant staff. Easy parking with a parking lot surrounding the building.",

Regarding the building, they did a wonderful job transforming this old pizza hut. All the tables have been refinished with stone design on top. They have a floor plan consisting of tables and booths, which are all spaced out nicely so that you are not on top of the person next to you. They also have actual place settings on each table which is a nice touch.   Now on to the food. Simply put,it was delicious. I'm very picky when it comes to sushi, but this truly hit the spot. My favorite is salmon nigiri, and there's did not disappoint.   The service was wonderful.

The service was very quick; we probably weren't waiting more than 10 minutes for our rolls, even though the restaurant was starting to get busy for dinner on a Friday night. I was expecting the fantastic roll, which was considered spicy, to only by seasoned with spicy mayo as many \"spicy\" rolls are, but the crunchy tuna was actually spiced inside the roll with a little more kick. It was *fantastic.* The rainbow roll was also delicious, with fish and avocado on the top of the roll, as opposed to all the fish inside the roll as some other restaurants make.  Overall, it was priced about the same as what you would expect from most sushi joints, ~$12 for a higher-end roll and ~$4 for nigiri. The waitress was friendly, and for the quick service and good sushi, I would wager we will be back soon!",

    "text": "We had to go into Bethel Park last night and came here to yelp to find a restaurant. When we saw Rice Inn and saw it had not only sushi and sashimi, but it also serves traditional chinese  and Thai foods also.. After reading some of the reviews, we knew we had to try it and the reviews were right on the money. We ordered 3 different rolls,  the Philadelphia roll, the Chicken Tempura Roll and the Sweet Potato Tempura roll, along with a side order of Chicken Egg rolls..We were quite surprised at how quickly the egg rollscame out and they were actually good sized and very tasty. While still eating them, our rolls came out and almost looked too nice to eat. I say almost, because we love sushi and couldn't wait to try it, besed on all the reviews. We were NOT disappointed one iota, as these rolls were fresh and their tastes were quite different and distinct. We ended up taking home almost half the pieces of the rolls, as this meal was rather filling for the 2 of us. As we Now have to go to Bethel Park regularly, we WILL be back and soon, as we are looking forward to trying their chinese and Thai dishes too.",

    "text": "If there is one word that describes Rice Inn (412.835.2800), a converted Pizza Hut, it is casual, casual, casual.  The tone is set by the young hostess, who was dressed for the beach: a hooded sweatshirt, seersucker shorts, and flat canvas shoes.  If one is seeking ambiance, this is not the place, though it is reasonably attractive and comfortable, and the tables and booths allow plenty of space to relax.  Diners may bring their own alcohol and there appears to be no corkage fee for wine.    The restaurant became extremely loud as the evening went on as some of the diners overindulged in wine.  The restaurant is in its first few weeks of operation, and it shows.  Our harried, but pleasant young female server forgot our request for water and hot tea.  After fifteen minutes, we received water after asking a second time. She was apologetic.  Later in the meal, a refill was provided without our having to ask.  We did not receive the tea.  My wife ordered a sushi platter with salad and miso soup with seaweed.  The good-sized salad with iceberg lettuce, carrots, and tasty ginger dressing arrived twenty minutes after the dinner order was placed, the soup a few minutes later. The sushi was brought to the table several minutes before my hot items. There were eighteen pieces in this large platter of sushi, which she enjoyed, a bargain for $10.95.  I ordered chicken egg roll ($1.95), chow fun noodles with pork (a flat, wide egg noodle) (yes, very unhealthful: a splurge), $9.00, and tofu (bean curd) with mixed vegetables: broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, snow peas ($8.95). The egg roll came within a few minutes of ordering, but  it was a vegetable roll, not the chicken variety I had ordered.  Instead of asking me whether I wanted the vegetable roll, the server instructed me to eat it and that she would order the chicken roll.  I did as she directed and consumed both.  Neither was particularly tasty and both were served lukewarm, at best.  Both of the entrees were a good portion, tasty, and served in delicious sauces: not too oily, but the tofu dish was drowning in the sauce, causing it to be soggy. Both dishes were the proper temperature: steaming hot.  Neither of the large platters was brought with any serving utensil.  Although the take-out menu shows an American Express icon in the section where accepted credit cards are listed, the server told me that the restaurant does not accept it.  I understand the husband and wife owners, Mr. and Mrs. Ho, are lovely people, but they were apparently not present on this evening.  No owner or manager was overseeing the dining room and no one other than the server checked on us.  In most respects, I compare Rice Inn unfavorably to my favorite Asian restaurant in the area, Red Tea House in the Virginia Manor Shops in Mount Lebanon.  Red Tea House is somewhat more expensive and the portions are somewhat smaller, but it consistently offers great service and artistically-presented cuisine, ambiance, and top-notch management, which oversees the dining room and makes every guest feel welcome. Water and tea are not ever forgotten at Red Tea House because these items are brought when the server first approaches the customer, along with delicious crisp noodles (alas, also unhealthful.)  For value, convenience, and reasonably good food, I am likely to return to Rice Inn on occasion, but it is not at the top of my list.  The restaurant also offers Thai cuisine, including the famous Pad Thai.  It maintains no website and does not advertise.",
