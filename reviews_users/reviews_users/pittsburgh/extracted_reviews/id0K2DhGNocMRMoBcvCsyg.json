We started with kra tong thong, \"Herbed minced chicken, sweet corn, carrot in pastry crispy shells.\" (Also has peas.) These were wonderful little morsels in a phyllo-like mini-cup that don't overfill you before your main meal. I had grapow kai krop, \"Stir-fried, crispy-chunk chicken, green beans, carrot and bell pepper in spicy basil sauce.\" This is a spicy dish and the heat level option on the spicy food is 1-3. I love HOT, so I ordered 3, expecting a \"Pittsburgh hot,\" which is not very hot at all. This was nicely spicy -- enough to give a little burn (to me, at least) but not so much that all you tasted was HOT! This was very, very good and another dish I would order again, if it weren't for the 20 other dishes on the menu I want to try. My husband got spicy fried rice, \"Stir-fried spicy garlic sauce with egg, mixed with steamed jasmine rice, carrot, bell pepper, onion and basil. Delicious. About a 7-8 on the typical scale of heat in Pittsburgh. I also had the homemade purple lemonade, which was slightly floral (lavender maybe?) and not at all sweet. Put some gin in it and you've got a great cocktail! Speaking of which, the place is BYOB with a corkage fee and has take-out menus. We will definitely go back and take friends along in the near future.",

    "text": "The new kid on the block in Pittsburgh Thai is certainly the best. This is a sleek and cozy new Thai restaurant specializing in central Thailand styles with excellent skill at balancing seasoning and spice as well as featuring more seafood options than you may be used to.  *updated*  My first visit we got crispy rolls and larb which were both excellent, particularly the larb (a seasoned ground beef over chopped salad). The entree was the very satisfying crab curry which was a sweet and spicy yellow curry full of generous amounts of lump crab. The flavors were spot on and intriguing and absolutely balanced between the sweet of coconut milk, salty crab bits, and spice. Wouldn't worry about getting over seasoned here... which is important because these guys know how to balance heat and flavor expertly, something I don't get many other places.   Our second visit (review update) we got crispy rolls again and this time shared and pad Thai. While we eyed a gorgeous plate of red snapper come out to our neighboring table (and will be trying next time!!!), the pad Thai was in no way disappointing. Opting for a very clean flavor True to the noodle, protein, and peanut without lots of citrus or rooty tones like basically every pad Thai I've had in pgh, this was truly refreshing. Sauce was was just enough to keep noodle sticky but not wet the dish and packed full of spice and savoriness.   Staff and service and cleanliness all top notch.  FYI seating is limited so either don't bring more than 4-6 without calling ahead or do take out.  Help this new place flourish! An instant shadyside classic on Ellsworth!",

    "text": "I went here a few weeks after it opened, so things may have changed since I came. I went with two other friends on a Friday night, so naturally it was pretty busy, and we were told it was a 45 minute wait. The servers were all pretty personable and friendly, but the wait was just too long for me. If I had to wait the same amount of time in the future, I'd probably not eat here. We ended up going to the nearby liquor store and getting a few ciders and drinking it while waiting since we were both bored and hungry.  So here's the thing: the reason why the wait time is so long is because a lot of the parties are there with groups and are socializing over bottles of wine. Even though they finish their food, they are just chatting and drinking the wine, which ends up taking quite a while. So that's one thing to look out for.  I got the pad thai, which tasted great! I have no complaints about the quality of the food, which was high. It was just too small for big boys like me. I finished it in around five minutes after waiting a little over and hour, partially because I was so hungry.   The atmosphere was good, the place looks like a house and has a nail salon on the top but overall a nice feel if you're with friends.",

The door was difficult to open (felt locked to me but push hard) and I was a bit confused as to whether they closed in the afternoons or not, but someone let us in and we were seated straightaway. I appreciated the light, airy exterior and high ceilings, so different from most Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh. They're BYOB as well, so don't forget the six pack or bottle of wine ;-)  We began perusing the menu and settled on an appetizer consisting of minced, cooked chicken and vegetables in little pastry shells as well as some crispy spring rolls. Both were incredible, and I'm definitely planning on sampling more of their unique appetizers in the future. My friend had the red curry with chicken and I had the pumpkin curry. Both were ordered at a medium spice level (you can specify mild, medium, or hot) and each was on the milder side of medium but very tasty. I can easily say this was the best pumpkin curry I've had anywhere, and I'll definitely try other curries on the menu going forward. My friend's dish was wonderful as well, but I preferred the flavor profile of mine. Overall I really enjoyed the service, atmosphere, and food at Senyai Thai Kitchen, and I'm so pleased there's such an exciting new Thai option in Pittsburgh.",

I also see the creativity in the titles of the dishes.  The food is good, but there is something that it needs to take it to that next level if they want to compete with the many other Thai restaurants in the area.  I can't quite put my finger on what that thing is.  The location is great and so is the atmosphere.  I like that they added a deck outside to enjoy the fresh air.  I may be back at some point soon.",

There are only ~6 tables inside - not sure if I can bring a group, but it was great for date night.  Came in on a Tuesday evening and were seated immediately. Service was great - they are very attentive and answered my questions about the menu.  We ordered the Senyai summer roll for an appetizer - it was very lettuce heavy but the peanut sauce was delicious. I had the Pad Prik Pao and my companion had the Si-Ew. I loved my dish - the tofu was perfect, it was actually crisp on the outside and had a firm bite throughout. As a vegetarian, I eat a lot of chewy, soggy tofu, and this was so refreshing!  Medium spice was perfect for me.  My partner's Si-Ew was ordered with Mild spice (he's very spice sensitive). It had almost no spice, and he even called it bland. Either they accidentally gave him no spice or the mild is just very, very mild.  The highlight for me (after the tofu) was the mango with sticky rice! This is my absolute favorite dessert and they did it really nicely. I love the toasted sesame seeds on top - you don't always see that.  Price-wise I found it reasonable, and there are plenty of other veg-friendly things on the menu. Definitely will be back!",

Located in a house on Ellsworth, Senyai has a lot of light and a light decor.   The chairs and tables have an Ikea-esque feel to them, but they are comfortable enough.  The service was good and they were most accommodating when we walked in sans reservation.     I got the Pad Medmamuang, which is Crispy chicken, cashew nuts, onion, carrot and  bell pepper in a roasted chili sauce.  It was just spicy enough and plenty of food.   Next time, I will remember to BYOB - $5 corkage for wine (on the high side, but whatever) and $1 for beer.     We will be back for sure!",

The staff were all very pleasant with everyone of them helping each other and smiling the whole time. I sat near the back of the restaurant towards the kitchen and took a few peaks of the kitchen work space. The kitchen was just as clean as the seating area, which is always a good sign. I loved seeing one of the cooks in the back preparing food by hand very meticulously.   I ordered the Senyai Pad Kee Mao with a spice level 3(hottest level on menu). The food was incredible, very spicy, but without overwhelming or affecting the flavor of the dish at all.    I have had quite a few Thai places in the city (6 others, I think) and this is by far my favorite experience I have had hands down!  These people know how far customer service, cleanliness, and passion in their establishment and food can take them, and I expect them to be around for a very long time! I will be back, frequently.",

This place has a low key location, hidden from the busy parts on Ellsworth and is closer to the walking bridge near Spar Street.  It's interior decor is gorgeous.  Plus the service is very friendly and enthusiastic about their menu.  Now for the food... hands down one of the best Thai experiences I've had in the Burgh! We tried the Chicken Satay for appetizers, Pumpkin Curry and Senyai Moo Sup for our main entrees, plus one of the special warm desserts, taro custard (shaped in a cute little heart with toasted sesame seeds sprinkled on top)!    I've always had an issue with Thai restaurants being heavy handed with their seasonings, but this place got it right!   This is definitely going to be a regular place we dine at and I totally recommend it :).",

If you're going to charge this much, at least add a bit more noodles! That being said, there were 5 large very fresh shrimp (slightly  overcooked) which elevated the quality of the dish. Overall, good tasting pad thai but I won't be coming back unless they lower the price or make the portion bigger",

    "text": "Decided to come here while I was in Pittsburgh based on the pictures and reviews on Yelp. This place is fairly small and is decorated very modernly.   Upon our arrival, we were not greeted at all. I had to get the host's attention and was told that we must finish our meal within an hour as they have some reservations coming. This did not bother me, it was understandable as the place is so small and we had no reservations. What kind of annoyed me was that after we sat down, they did not give us menus right away.  When we did finally receive the menus, we had them for not even one minute and the waiter came to rush us in a very harsh tone. She was very rude, unprofessional and made our meal feel very uncomfortable.   We ordered the golden mushroom as appetizer. My sister got the wide noodles with chicken and I tried to order the papaya salad on the menu. The waiter rudely told me that they did not have papaya and the substitute was the mango salad. That was fine with me as I also love mangos. I asked for my order to be made with the highest spicy level and the waiter kept doubting my order (very annoying). The orders came out pretty quickly. The golden mushroom was fried enoki mushroom. I love enoki and thought that this would taste good. However, as the mushroom is so skinny, when it is fried, it just tasted like fried dough and barely tasted like mushroom. My sister's noodle was okay, nothing extraordinary and would taste the same at any other Thai restaurant. I did like my mango salad because it tasted fishy and authentic. The mangos were crunchy so it gave a nice texture. The portion of the salad was however very small.   During our meal, another waiter came by to check on us and he was extremely friendly and nice. Our waiter did not come to check on us and she just looked like she was pissed the entire time.   We finished our food within 30 mins and wanted to try out their desserts. However, as it did not feel like a pleasant experience, we decided to go get desserts at another place down the street instead.   Overall, below par restaurant experience because of the service.",

I made the mistake of asking for it a little spicier than I normally do with Thai but it was so delicious I didn't even want to take the time to send it back. My mistake, after all. The place is small so I imagine reservations on busier nights would be strongly encouraged (we went on a Tuesday night and were seated right away).

Our waitress her name was Audrey I believe was super sweet and knowledgeable about the menu choices. We got green curry and red curry with Thai Iced tea. Everything was the way we wanted it to be.

They gave us some hot sauce and crushed chili in bottles on the side because they didn't have any hot chili oil.   The panang came with a side of rice and had lots of vegetables in it. The kee mao also had lots of veggies. We wished there were more noodles in the dish, but it was still pretty good.  I feel like the place is kind of pricey for the amount of food you get, especially in comparison to places like noodlehead. It was still pretty good and I enjoyed my experience here.",

They advertise using organic chicken on their menu and after talking to their staff it seems the veggies are all organic too! They've told me all of their ingredients are great quality (my husband also once saw them carrying bags from Whole Foods into the kitchen). Their crab fried rice is one of my favorite dishes (it has real crab).   I love that I can order amazingly delicious food that's also great quality. I don't feel guilty ordering take out when we order from here. I'm gluten free and have never gotten sick either. Can't say enough good things about this place.",

    "text": "I stopped over here for lunch and was seated right away by the window. Both the dinner and lunch menu were on my table. My waitress was very friendly and helpful although she had a little bit of trouble understanding me. The decor is exceptional with all types of artwork from Thailand on the walls.  I knew that I wanted to order the eggplant stir-fried which comes with carrots, bell pepper, basil in a brown sauce. You get your choice of meat -chicken, pork, or tofu. If you want shrimp that is $2.00 extra.  She asked me how spicy I wanted it and I always go with mild. With your meal you get a small crispy roll with sauce. This place is BOYB and they have a corkage fee. Take out is also available.  They have one gender neutral restroom.  Shortly afterwards, I got my spring roll first which was indeed delicious. Shortly after that I got my main course with a heaping mound of white rice. If you want another type of rice you can get that for a slight upcharge. There was only one other person in the room and she was enjoying Pad Thai which i understand is their signature dish. She absolutely loved it and my meal was outstanding! The brown sauce provided just enough taste needed to make my lunch enjoyable.  For my beverage I opted for the unsweetened green tea since I learned the Thai tea they add milk to it and it is already sweetened. I learned that cold drinks are non-refillable.  Again be aware of that if you want more.   Having read about their desserts I decided to opt for one. I had the custard with sweet sticky rice. I loved how they warmed the rice to make it seem like I was eating both something warm and cold at the same time.  This is a charming Thai restaurant if you want to enjoy a Thai meal. The menu suggests no substitutions so that you can enjoy the Thai experience. Located on Ellsworth Ave near the bus way, you can find 2 hour street parking on Alder St nearby if you come during the day. Prices are reasonable and even the water glass I used had a unique design to it. Truly a great addition to the Shadyside area.",

My main course was the Pad See Ew. It wasn't the best I've had in Pittsburgh but still tasted pretty good. The portion size was nice, enough for me to save some for lunch the next day. The proportion of noodle to greens to tofu was better than some of the other Pad See Ew dishes that I've had in the past.   The service was fast and easy, for takeout. When I arrived, the decor was very inviting and I'd like to go back and dine-in. Overall, a good experience that will make me come back to Senyai as my local Thai restaurant!",

My first choice was a pork belly curry, served with rice. The pork belly was melt in your mouth tender and the curry was perfectly spicy. Spice scale out of 3, I went with the 3 and it turned out to be a satisfying but not overwhelming heat. Just enough to start to sweat but not overwhelming to cover the rest of the dish.   Second choice was green curry, my go to, and what I use to compare Thai restaurants. The dish was remarkable, the vegetables were clearly never frozen and super fresh. The protein cooked nicely, and fair amounts of both. Again, a 3 on the heat was spot on.   It's a small restaurant and very nicely decorated inside with a clean modern feel. The staff were great both times, very attentive, and humbly gracious of our raving in restaurant reviews. I'm dreaming of the next time I get to have Senyai Thai Kitchen.",

    "text": "Senyai Thai has really incredibly tasty food with a range of flavors, textures and freshness that are welcome, especially on hot summer days. The interior is modern and well laid out, though as a girl with big hips I did wish they had some chairs without arms or a bench seat available. Everything was brightly lit and clean, and the servers were super friendly. While I know that butterfly pea blossom tea isn't specifically Thai, the color appeal of purple lemonade (which changes to fuchsia or blue based on acidity) was a delight. Their tofu with ginger and basil was delicious and not greasy at all, and not afraid of a bit of spice (ordered a level 3, so there were pepper seeds and flakes in there). I'm thrilled to get to try this place, and look forward to coming back another time.",

There are many veg and gf options on the menu that are clearly labeled which is awesome. I got the Kee Mao with tofu and ordered it with max spice (level 3). The noodles were so yummy as were the fresh vegetables--the only problem was that the spice was pushing my limits and I had gulp down some water every few bites. I was a bit shocked because I usually am a level 9 or 10 at most Thai places but now I know to get a level 2 here next time!! Overall a great experience and I can't wait to be back.",

After trying to call to ask about the menu, I was put on \"hold,\" aka the phone was put on the desk, for over 25 minutes. Enough time for me to drive to the restaurant and ask in person. When I arrived, the phone was still off the hook and unable to receive any new calls.  No apologies or anything, just \"I just got here, I didn't do that.\" I was able to get my questions answered and put in a takeaway order. After waiting nearly 45 minutes for my food (quoted 20-25 minutes), I was able to bring the food home for dinner.  The Si Ew and Red Curry were pretty good. Good enough that we will be coming back to try some of the other menu items. Nice to have a clear menu with what is Gluten Free, Vegan, etc. for those of us with food allergies & preferences. I'm hoping the next experience will be better and will update if that's True.",

However, the peanut sauce was amazing. I also had the crispy tofu appetizer, which was okay.   For my dinner, I had the pad kee mao with shrimp and calamari (spicy level 3/3) and it was not that great. For $20, the portion could have been bigger and the food could have tasted SO much better. In total with my family members' meals and our appetizers, our bill was $100!!!!! That's ridiculous. I've had way better Thai food at other restaurants that's probably around $30-$50.   I can't say that I would recommend this place; it's not worth dropping all kinds of money for lackluster food. I probably won't go back since there's many other Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh that have better food.",

I sat inside to see the interesting ceiling. Its clean and had fresh flowers on each table.  I ordered the shrimp volcano dish which had a sweet and hot chili sauce. It was delicious. I should have asked for more heat.  I decided to try their thai dessert of sweet sticky rice and mango. The sweet sticky rice was delicious but at first bite the mango didn't seem to go. After another bit of the two it made more taste sense.  This is a very nice place with nice people and interesting food. I'd eat here again.",

Nothing beats eating yummy food in a nice environment. The hung lay curry had so much flavor! I had 1 for spicy level and it was perfect, not too spicy but it had a nice kick. It's a bit pricey for lunch though. Also since it's in an older house, it was a bit chilly sitting on hard chairs without padding. We stayed a while after we paid and didn't feel rushed to leave. We had a great time here and would definitely come back.",

    "text": "Wow I was impressed by Senyai Thai Kitchen.  My wife and I were planning on visiting another Thai restaurant but we ended up deciding to go with this one.  For one this restaurant is on one of our favorite streets that has a few of our favorite restaurants so we knew this had to be a good place!  Also we saw that they got a lot of good reviews on Yelp so we were expecting something good and it really was! First of all this is BYOB with a corkage fee of $5 for wine and $1 for beer.  Lunch is served between 11am and 2pm Monday through Saturday.  When you walk in it's bright inside and a nice  modern atmosphere.  It was inviting and a little small but not too small.  We got good seats along the window.  Our waitress was nice and gave us time to figure out what we wanted to order.  She went over the specials for the day and did a good job.       We started off with their Shrimp and Pork dumpling for an appetizer.  I thought they were delicious.  My wife is the bigger dumpling fan in our family but I really enjoyed them too.       For my dinner I ordered the Senyai Moo Sup with Chicken.  You can ask for hot, medium, or mild.  We both asked for medium but our waitress brought out the hot one if we wanted to add to it.  My wife did use the extra heat but I didn't need to.  About fifteen minutes after we ordered our dinner came out.  It looked really good and it was delicious.  I was really hungry so I cleaned my plate.  I ate slow so that I could savor it and so that I wouldn't finish my food and just watch my wife eat hers.  The flavor was great, the wide noodles were yummy, and overall a great dish.  My only complaint is for the price of the food I would expect a little more on the plate.  I was still a little hungry after and that was on top of splitting the appetizer with my wife.  Still this Is a great Thai place to visit if you haven't yet and I really do want to come back for more!",

We also chose Senyai because we were in the mood for Asian cuisine, and because it was BYOB. As a result of our changing plans, we had not made a reservation. Senyai is a smaller restaurant and it was a Friday night, so we weren't surprised when the hostess told us we had to wait for a party to finish their meal before we could take their table. However, the wait staff actually shoehorned a table into a little nook between the kitchen and dining room for us so that we could be seated sooner.  This gesture and service helped make my experience at Senyai an excellent one. Sure, the space we were in was cramped. In order to leave my seat I had to push the entire table away from me. Both spent and chilling wine bottles had to be put on the floor. The kitchen staff probably heard most of our conversations. But, it felt like an intimate/private dining experience with my friends, and we were extremely appreciative to be seated nearly immediately.   The service for the rest of the meal was excellent, too--unfortunately I do not remember my waitress' name. The food was delicious, as well. I ordered the panang curry with pork, and got it at a 3/3 on the spicy scale, which was very spicy, but not overwhelmingly so.  If I had a complaint, it's that relative to the prices, the serving sizes are on the smaller size. With tip and a $5 corkage fee, two entrees cost $43.  Overall, I had a great meal and experience at Senyai and would definitely dine there again.",

The servers were very prompt and professional and the food was delicious. I had the Tom Yum soup (appetizer size) and the Pad Thai, and my friend got the full entree size Tom Yum. The flavors of both Tom Yums were excellent, and the appetizer size Tom Yum had quite a kick (a level 2 on their 1-3 spice scale) but I preferred the flavors of the full size Tom Yum which had shrimp and an excellent lemon seafood flavor. The Pad Thai was very well done and the portion size was very large for the price, which I liked. Definitely the best Tom Yum I have had in Pittsburgh, and one of the better Pad Thais. The only complaint I could find would be that the music was quite loud and they had the same song on repeat for 45 minutes, not a big deal but slightly irritating.",

What they brought out for soup: a Tom Yum, and then when we said we ordered a Tom Kha the waitress wanted to tell us we were wrong so we just ordered another Tom Kha. What we thought of the food:  Tom Kha - Good flavor, but had cabbage in it, which was a little different than an authentic Tom Kha.  Tom Yum - Had good flavor as well.  Lemongrass Salad - Wasn't worth it. There wasn't much going on. I would pass on this one. Red Curry - Needed more curry flavor. Just tasted like coconut. I would pass on this too.  We had to pay for the extra Tom Kha. Anyway, seems like the only thing we enjoyed here was the Tom Kha and the Tom Yum. Spicy also isn't very spicy here. I probably won't be back.",

As soon as I walked in I had a feeling that this was going to be an amazing experience - and I was more than pleasantly surprised. Just the smell that permeated the restaurant and the ambiance of the decor make you realize that whoever runs this establishment has good taste, is clean and organized, and gives a lot of attention to detail and the subtle nuances of all the pleasures life has to offer.  One of my closest friends (who is also a really good cook) invited me here out of the blue and introduced this place to me as one of her favorite places. We shared an entree and a couple beverages which I will expound on here :  Green curry - best curry ever, creamy and rich in flavor with well balanced spices and a good variety of vegetables (which they let us pick) cooked to perfection.   Green Thai Tea - this refreshing beverage uses high quality matcha and coconut milk and gives you a clean energy throughout the day.  Blue Lemongrass - this is my friends favorite tea ever and I could see why - it has a very unique flavor and is very comforting.  This restaurant uses high quality, fresh ingredients and offers their meals at VERY reasonable prices - I highly suggest going here and ordering some of the menu. You will NOT be disappointed. I plan to invite my vegan and gluten free friends here also since they have a lot of these options on their menu.",

We started with a thai iced tea, and a thai green iced tea.  Both were awesome.  It was my first-find for the green option.  I really liked it!  It had a very unique flavor, and I am glad I ventured off of my normal thai tea choice to try it.   I tried their Tom Kha soup...and it was the best i've ever had.  I've been having dreams about it ever since.  I need to go back!   For dinner, we tried the Pumpkin Curry and the Kee Mao (we chose chicken as the protein).  Both were fantastic.  They had just the right level of heat, and an abundance of flavor.  Delicious!  The only thing I can critique is that in my personal opinion, I would have liked a bit more protein in the curry, and found it just a tad bit small portion-wise for the price compared to the other dinner we received.  This again, though, is my personal opinion.  However, it did have an abundance of delicious chunks of pumpkin in it.  So, maybe that is why it was a little less on the meat?  Either way, though, the flavor was unbelievable!  I would get it over, and over, and over again.    I can't wait to make my way down to that area again to try some of the other things.  I found many visits worth of choices I would like to try!",

My only complaint would be that the Seafood Delight appetizer only had two pieces of shrimp which made it difficult for everyone to have a taste.  My family and I ordered the crab fried rice, duck curry and shrimp pad thai. The crab fried rice was my favorite with lots of large crab chunks throughout the dish. The shrimp pad thai was good but nothing surprising and the duck curry was really flavorful.  The service was great but it does get busy so definitely make reservations ahead of time for dinner. Great for a date night or even just dinner with friends.",

Ordered crispy tofu bites and fresh rolls for our appetizer and shared a Kee Mao Tofu for our main. The fresh rolls were delicious, lots of vermicelli, and I really liked the sauce. The Kee Mao and tofu bites were also delicious but pretty oily. Too much oil on both, it left a residue on my lips. It was a shame because this was one of the most unique and delicious Kee Mao's I've ever had. Many kinds of vegetables when the standard usually just has cabbage or bok choy. It also had an almost grilled, smoked flavor.  I was very happy to see vegan curries and will absolutely come back and try one. Our waiter was more than lovely as well. Overall, very good experience.",

The inside seating is intimate and the outdoor deck seating is great as Senyai is conveniently located on Ellsworth Ave.   Crab ragoons and the dumplings are great starters and both come with great sauces for dipping. I've often enjoyed the crab fried rice which provides plenty of lump crab meat. I wanted to try a new noodle dish my last visit and the waitress recommended the si-ew which was a nice change from an always solid pad thai. The noodles and brown sauce were amazing and there was a ton of chicken and vegetables. I ordered a one spice level and additional of the house spice on the side.   I've also ordered from Senyai a number of times for take out as it is a quick walk and the food again is always delicious and holds up through delivery. It's a great place to frequent or go on a date.",

    "text": "The absolute most delicious Thai food I have ever had the chance to taste in my life! There's really no other way to describe the dishes at Senyai. The reputation precedes itself for sure and perfectly displays what it is to have authentic Thai. I was recommended this place by a co-worker and had learned that the co-owner (Gary) was also a co-worker (what a coincidence!) So after reading as well as hearing multiple positive reviews, I decided to make a reservation and head in.  Situated in a quaint and cozy neighborhood, Senyai had a welcoming feel to it. The decor was modern and lively, and the sensual scents of fried rice, noodles and fresh herbs graced my nose as soon as I entered. We were able to snag a seat for two right by the window right before the dinner rush, so reservations are a strong suggestion.   I started with the spring rolls, which tasted as if they were prepared by only a top-skilled chef with crisp carrots, spring mix and cool cucumbers. The peanut dipping sauce was an excellent compliment and the portion size of 8 was more than worth the price. I also recommend the Thai herb wings, absolutely cooked to perfection. I followed with the crab fried rice on a plate that was big enough to feed 3! Huge chunks of hot, steamy crab filled the soft but sticky fried rice. It was absolutely amazing! My fiancee ordered the Si-Ew with chicken and loved every bit of it there and the next day. BYOB was only a few bucks which made our experience even that much more enjoyable.  Senyai definitely lived up to the hype and I reminisce the tastes of it almost everyday. I want to thank Gary, his wife and their team for a superb dining experience. We can't wait to stop back.",

They also have a patio but it was closed when we went because bad weather was expected. We ordered the summer veggie rolls served with a delicious peanut sauce, my wife had the pumpkin curry dish which she absolutely loved, and I had the pad Thai special with shrimp and chicken. It is BYOB, but being out of towners, We didn't bring anything but the corkage fee is very reasonable: one dollar per beer and five dollars per bottle of wine. The prices for entrees were also fair. The only thing preventing this from review from being a full five stars was that the shrimp was rubbery and overcooked. Otherwise we really enjoyed this place and would definitely come back when passing through Pittsburgh again.",

    "text": "We stopped here the other night.  This was our second visit, and after recovering from a turkey hangover we were excited to come back.  When we arrived there was a larger table in the front of the place but they soon left and we were alone to enjoy our meals.  For an appetizer we ordered their summer rolls, and asked for a carousel of Thai chili sauce.  We were presented with the sauce and a ground up spice.  I began mixing up my sauce then I dumped a lot too much dry spice on my prepared sauce.  I thought it would be ok so I ate my rolls as normal.  Tasty and fresh, though a tad on the smaller side VS other places.  So after eating we waited to be served our meals.  Here is where the Thai spice lurched with angry might from my mouth to my burning stomach.  In essence I ate a tablespoon of ground spicy chili.  Pain swelled as I watered my burning mouth.  Water doesn't work well but I didn't see a glass of milk or freezing bowl of ice cream so I did my best.  Our entrees were served and I requested Thai hot.  I don't regret this, it was nice and flavorful even though Satan himself was flaming the bonfire in my mouth.   I carried on and enjoyed my Kee Mao with tofu.  The tofu was really good as was the noodles, not choppy and not stuck together, BONUS!  But the portion size seemed more suitable to lunch than dinner with a price tag to match.  If the prices or portions could be adjusted accordingly this may be in contention for one of the best Thai restaurants in the Burgh.  The atmosphere is very nice and modern, so this could also be driving the premium.  Enjoy and be cautious of the killer carousel and a heavy hand!",

Perfect for rainy or cold days when your feeling run down.  As with most items on their menu, You can choose the degree of spiciness your pallet will allow.  Parking in the area is hard to find, which is why i only gave them 4 stars, however they do have delivery, for a hefty fee. Portions are small for the pricing, but the food is delicious.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely incredible. I thought I had already written my review a long time ago about how great this place is. I have tried every thai place in Pittsburgh, and although is a little bit more on the pricier end. . . it is worth it.   I live close and come here either for lunch or dinner or take-out at least once a week. I never get tired of thai food but that's just me.   Their green curry is absolutely incredible. I have yet to find a green curry that has as much flavor as this one. Their eggplant in the green curry and all the vegetables for that matter are done perfectly. I get the green curry with tofu, although I have had the chicken as well.   If I want to switch it up I get the pad thai or I highly recommend their pad thai special. I think it was that much of a hit that they are making it a permanent item. It is a glass noodle pad thai with chicken and shrimp. I highly recommend that as well. If you are in the mood I also tired their eggplant stir-fry when I wanted to really switch it up because I just could not get enough eggplant and it was very good.   In regards to the appetizer menu, I have officially tired them all and you can not go wrong. My personal preference are the crab ragoon, or spring rolls.   This place is BYOB, but take a short little walk to the wine and spirits right up the street and then come here to enjoy that wine with some wonderful thai food.   Senyai, you will always get a 10/10 in my book.",

I got the crab fried rice and my friend got the crab curry (which I had before). It was delicious. Senyai is one of my favorite places for Thai food in Pittsburgh.

The crab rangoons were perfect! The filling was delicious and I could actually taste crab. The spring rolls were nice and fresh! For dinner, I had the senyai tom yum. The broth was nice and flavorful. A medium heat of 2 was not spicy at all. My friend had the red curry with chicken and enjoyed it as well. My only complaint was that I wish there had been more broth. Overall, an excellent place to grab thai food in the shadyside area. For the amount of food given, prices are on the higher end, but still worth it!",

They have a really nice outdoor patio.   We had the Tom Yum soup and chicken satay to start. The chicken was delicious and done well.   We both had curries for our main: red and pumpkin. I loveeeee pumpkin curry and I must say this might be one of my favorite places to get it in the city. The flavor is great. I really appreciate how they have smaller pieces of squash and chicken so I can get a little with each bite!   Their spice levels are hot! I'm not someone who likes things super spicy.. I typically get a lower number. Our waitress said the curry can get pretty hot at baseline so I went for no added spice and I think it still had a kick!  Oh -- and the service was great!  Only managed a picture of the chicken satay because I was too exited to eat the curry!",

I hope that's the reason for the below par meal. I ordered shrimp green curry with brown rice.  Got charged for brown rice but was given white. Since I was already at my next meeting, had to deal. The shrimp were over cooked and the veggies were sparse. No broccoli as listed on the online menus and mostly cheap red peppers. For $16.50... a crappy deal. Spice level of 3 ( the hottest) was a 6/10.  Green Curry sauce was watered down compared to last time.   And my entree was five overcooked shrimp, five pieces of small eggplant, some green beans and peppers and lots of liquid. I hope it was just the college rush but will return to Banana Leaf or Thai Cottage for lunch at work. I loved it the first time so I hope it was a fluke.",

We enjoyed dinner here with orders of the Pad Medmamuang and Pad Thai, both of which were quite delicious, and one order of the sticky rice mango which was fantastic.   Unfortunately I don't have much experience with Thai food so my descriptions are somewhat lacking, but if you're looking for all-around solid and decent grub this place should be able to more than provide.   Again, really enjoyed the dessert! Warm and chewy and sweet and well balanced flavor. Yum.",

The noodles weren't all identically wide which makes them seem more authentic to me. If I went again, I'd get medium spice. I tried one of my friend's crab rangoons, which was made with real (not imitation) crab and came with a sweet and sour type dipping sauce. They were light and crispy, with a savory but not too heavy filling. You definitely get what you pay for, and I had enough pad Thai left over for a whole extra meal.",

Can't ask for much more than that for a casual evening out!   The food was overall quite good. My biggest complaint was that I ordered a dish with the maximum spice level and our waitress acted shocked that anyone would do that. When it arrived, it was extremely mild. I'm wondering if it was a kitchen error. No biggie, though, because it was still tasty.   Overall I would recommend Senyai for a nice little evening out.",

We didn't think it could get any better but when the Custard with Sticky Rice and Taro Custard came out we were blown away. They were incredible. We had ordered a Pumkin with Coconut dessert as well, but sadly they were sold out. I guess we will have to come back :).

    "text": "I've driven past this place several times while doing my laundry at the laundromat down the road. On one laundry day, having not eating breakfast and it was already mid-afternoon, I was feeling pretty peckish. After dumping my clothes in the dryers, I walked to this restaurant. (FYI, there is no lot parking for the restaurant; there is only street parking). The dining area is very small, having maybe 8-10 tables. The decor was also very nice. I could tell they had recently renovated because everything looked new and spotless. I thought this would be a good place to have an intimate meal with someone...although the tables were pretty close to one another.  There were two waitresses, and I was greeted and seated promptly. As an appetizer, I ordered one of the specials that were written on the outdoor sign - the Thai dumplings - and got the Senyai Pad Kee Mao (spice level 2/3). For my drink, I got my usual water along with the Thai iced tea.  I hadn't known that Thai iced tea comprised of brewed tea, spices, sugar, and condensed milk. When it came out, I was wondering why it looked thick, creamy...and orange. I took a sip of it and... SUGAR BOMB! Ick! I'm not a fan of sugary or creamy drinks, and this was both. Although it was good for cleansing my palate of the spice of my main dish, I couldn't finish it.  The Thai dumplings were pretty good. Good filling to dough ratio. It was a little bland, though, even with the soy sauce dip.  Despite the mediocre beginning, the Pad Kee Mao was very good. Spice level was perfect; the portion was great for lunch; and there was a good balance of each ingredient. Unlike the first two things I got, I did finish this dish.  Overall, they had good service; tasty and filling main dish; and nice, upscale decor. For the first two mediocre items, I deducted a star (and a half), so I'm giving this restaurant 3.5 stars (not 4). Because this was my only visit, I'll probably come back again to check out some of their other items.",

However, I didn't like the environment of the restaurant, as it was basically built inside an ordinary house and the price is way too high to justify, especially when their competitor Noodlehead (which also serves thai food) about two blocks away tastes just as good, has more choices on the menu , and is costs about 3-4 times less than this place. Only reason you should come is if you don't want to wait in line for an hour for noodlehead or you don't like the fact that Noodlehead is cash only, but I'd still recommend going to noodlehead instead.",

Here's why:   The first visit, we showed up on a Saturday without a reservation. They let us sit outside on their beautiful patio, with the understanding that we would have to be done by a certain time for a larger party to come in. No problem! The service was always quick and kind.   We ordered the fresh rolls, which come with a delicious peanut sauce. I had the green curry with chicken- their curry sauce is amazing- smooth yet spicy with plenty of veggies and generous amounts of chicken. My husband ordered the crab curry, and pronounced it to be his new favorite dish at a Thai restaurant. It is BYOB, so we enjoyed our wine as the sun sank behind us. Ellsworth is a fairly quiet street, so it was a pleasant place to dine. The owner was even enjoying a meal and glass of wine beside us! He very kindly asked about our meals and our made sure we approved of everything. We absolutely did and went back twice in a month to prove it!   Overall a lovely place, and I look forward to many more delicious meals.",

I ended up paying $24 with tip for my crab curry, which I think is pricey for a lunch meal. Service was decent - there was one waitress who was also the hostess, she wasn't super enthusiastic but got the job done. Otherwise, I would give this place a try. They have some very vegetable focused dishes which I appreciate. Might be a good idea to make a reservation for dinner or on a weekend as the place is small.",

    "text": "Senyai is a super cute little restaurant in Shadyside that my boyfriend and I decided to try last night when we both had a craving for Thai but didn't want to go to Noodlehead (again). The restaurant itself is beautiful and so clean. They recommend reservations because the restaurant is so small but we were seated very quickly at a table by the window. We ordered the Crab Rangoons which were delicious, I probably wouldn't get them again though because they taste just like every other crab Rangoon I've ever eaten. For dinner I got the Grapow Kai Crop Chef's Special and he got the Pad Medmamuang and both were INCREDIBLE! We both like spicy food so we both picked spicy level 2 on a scale of 0-3. It was the perfect level of spice. The portion sizes are bigger than they seem. I highly recommend Senyai Thai and we'll be back again soon!  PS. It's also BYOB!!! $5 corking fee for wine, $1 for beer.",

I love how it's in a house - definitely a different but welcome change since we don't have too many restaurants like that in the DMV area.   The inside was small and cozy and I really liked the interior decor, but they unfortunately didn't have room for the four of us inside at the time. Instead of telling us we had to wait, they gave us the option of sitting outside. The weather was perfect and we've been stuck in a car for 7+ hours, so we took it. We were then left to the most lovely garden area, where the staff promptly set up our table. The lady even spent a few minutes trying to position our table so it wouldn't wobble. Our servers was always attentive and nice, and it made me happy to see that they seemed to enjoy their jobs and take pride in the restaurant. Also, the bathroom is super clean. Excellent ambiance, perfect for a date or just hanging out with a few friends.  In terms of food, the portion sizes was just right. The drinks were perfectly sweet. All entrees we ordered were flavorful, seasoned right, and cooked properly - especially surprised with the calamari. It was nice to eat one and not get rubber. My favorite were the two soups we ordered. My friend got Tom Yum, which was hearty and warmed my cold soul up. And I've always been indifferent with Tom Kha until I had Senyai's..and now I'm afraid I'll never have good Tom Kha ever again. Guess I have to come back here next time I'm in Pitt oh nooooo  In short, it was a stinkin' cute restaurant with awesome food and just as awesome service. Even hours later, my heart is still so warm from seeing the staff smile so much. Can't wait until I come back.",

We were told that 3 was habanero hot, so we ordered everything at a 2 and it definitely lacked some heat! We started with Tom yum soup with tofu that was delicious. We ordered the summer rolls which I highly recommend. We also ordered the dumplings which we were told were a fan favorite but they never came. And the kale salad with tomatoes, avacado and apple cider vinaigrette was pushed but fell short.  For dinner, we had the panang Chicken and prik king stir fry with veggies. Both were good. Then it was suggested that we order the crab curry and the Mama kee mao. Crab curry was good but it could have used some veggies since it only came with kale. The Mama kee mao came with shrimp and squid, but the squid was a little rubbery. The noodles were ok, but remind you of cup of noodles Raman.   $5 corkage fee for wine and $1 corkage fee for beer.",

Couldn't resist getting the grapow kai krop (still delicious!), but also tried their pad si-ew and green curry this time.  Pad si-ew very nice but not amazing.  Green curry was a grand slam!  Perfectly balanced and light, full of delicious veggies.  The eggplant in particular (an Asian variety--not sure which type) was so tasty I that would be perfectly happy with just a bowl of their rice, eggplant and green curry.  As before, staff were lovely people and very professional.  To call them a neighborhood gem is a disservice.  Well worth a trip to Shadyside from anywhere in Pittsburgh.  Additional note:  Hard to imagine an easier online ordering experience.  For the sake of not coming off as a shill, I won't mention their platform by name, but IT. JUST. WORKS. and I wish most other local restaurants used it.  Doesn't require an app or an account.  Ordered and paid from my phone riding the P1 bus home from work and it couldn't have been simpler.",
