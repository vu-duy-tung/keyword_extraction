Parmesan pork is amazing (just personal taste :) ).  I have been to several other churrascarias (one in Brazil too) and I would say that it is really comparable.  The only thing it might be room for improvement is to bring a larger variety of meats (to justify also the fairly high price compared to other places with larger variety).",

At some point, they paraded a cow through the room and people just bit it.  He was a dignified cow, with the stoic demeanor of an old John Wayne.  I watched as he was slowly eaten away to a skeleton.  A bitter tear slid down my cheek as I lamented my bovine friend.  I turned the red/green thingy to red to give him a moment of silence...then turned it back to green and ate some different type of meat.  I left when they walked the live turkey through the room.  Uh, but yeah, this place is a pretty good experience in general, the staff is good, the food is delicious.  There can be a moment of sticker shock when the bill comes, but this place works best as an informal special event type of place.  All in all, a pretty fun experience.",

Service was very friendly and outgoing, even when I went with a large group, and the meat was always succulent and juicy.  I'm surprised that people are complaining about the price.  I can tell you that at other churrascarias around the country you can expect to pay 40-75% more for the same meal.  And I feel that the Green Forest just seems to have a better atmosphere and better tasting meet than chains such as Fogo de Chao.  I can only hope to compare my experiences there with churrascarias in Brazil if/when I go for business travel.",

    "text": "Green Forest is a Brazilian churrascaria - a rodizio restaurant. The idea is a fixed price menu for as much meat as you can eat. They bring out flank steak, top sirloin, bacon wrapped filet mignon, pork loin, chicken, chicken hearts, Brazilian sausage, beef rib, and other meat and cut it and put it on your plate.   They also have a warm buffet with rice, beans, fish, and pasta. Their cold buffet has shrimp, salad, mussels, clams, ahi tuna, artichoke hearts, cheese, salami type meats, and a bunch of other food. It's not a vegetarian friendly place.  I think this restaurant has some 5 star qualities, and some 2 star qualities. The restaurant's atmosphere isn't great: they no longer have a liquor license, it's in an office park, the ceiling tiles aren't immaculate. But the meat is excellent - and there's really nowhere else you can get this much meat and have it be so good. Bring a big stomach, and your wallet. It's not cheap ($26.95 + drinks, tax, and tip), but it's fun to do once a year.",

    "text": "My first time at this type of Brazilian restaurant, but i am sure that it will not be my last. As previous posts indicate, it will really cater to meat lovers, and those with large appetites. As many have stated, it is rather pricey, but really not bad if you eat a lot, and especially for the quality of food. Desserts and drinks are not included, but it is BYOB. Many different beef, some sausage, chicken and a few lamb. The lamb was excellent, and the parmesian beef (tenderloin, I think) was suprising tasty and tender. Their salad bar is underrated, I think, as most come for the meat. It has nice olives (including red olives), seafood salads, some tuna and salmon sashimi, cured meats (I think decent prosciutto, salami, and sopressata) among others. The black beans were also good - very smoky flavor. I have now been here twice, and my second visit was better than the first. The meats were all cooked medium rare (with some a little more on the rare side), while at my first visit a few were well done. The parmesan steak was wonderful both times - the parmesan flavor really comes through, much more than one would think. The flank steak was very tender, and the filet had a great crust on it. My piece was half crust, and it was awesome. The leg of lamb had quite a gamey flavor/grass fed flavor - which I love. The lamb chop was also great.",

This is not really a place you would patronize on a regular basis, but definitely the place to go when you find yourself experiencing that deep, inchoate desire to indulge your carnivorous cravings. An excellent destination for lapsed vegetarians to get back in touch with their authentic self.  Green Forest serves a wonderful variety of grilled meats and has a very nice buffet with good quality seafood and sides. You need to bring your own wine (or beer). And you do want to plan for a leisurely meal; all that meat is heavy going, so give yourself a chance to sample your way through the full rotation. Including the grilled pineapple. Yum. At the end, if you still have room or inclination, do check out their dessert offerings. A sherbet goes down quite nicely at that point.  The service has always been great; nice people and with a sense of humor.",

My expectations lowered further when I saw that the restaurant was \"out by Monroeville\" (actually Penn Hills). My heart sank as we pulled up to a semi-abandoned 5-6 story corporate buildings tucked behind a tattered 1960's strip center. My only hope was that the YELP reviews I had read would be True (nearly 5 star average). The inside of the restaurant was nothing special but pleasant enough (corporate cafeteria circa 1990) and clean. Let me just cut to the chase and say that the quality of the food was fabulous. I did not do the \"meat\" version of the menu but had the hot food and \"salad bar\" option. Everything I had was super fresh and of high quality: traditional Brazilian bean stew with melt-in-your-mouth chunks of meat, a seafood stew, shrimp cocktail, a cheese and bread bar, and much more! The cuts of meat that were brought over for my tablemates looked lean and delicious (parmesan filet mignon, lamb, skirt steaks, top sirloin in madeira sauce, rib eye). But beyond the remarkable food was the service. The lovely host and our server deserve 6 out of 5 stars. They explained everything, checked in just the right amount of times, and answered all our questions and filled our requests with speed, accuracy, and graciousness. I can't recommend this place enough!",

Regardless of that both the bar and buffet are impressive.  I started off by going up to the cold bar which had a wonderful selection of different foods.  It contained everything from savory meats and fresh Parmesan cheese to crab legs and even some sushi and sashimi.  Honestly, I could have been happy with just eating from the buffet the whole night but the best was yet to come.  If you have ever been to a  Brazilian steakhouse before then you know the ridiculous selection of meats that they have.  Everything that they brought out seemed to be cooked perfectly with my favorites being the skirt steak and the Parmesan encrusted filet.  The meat servers were also very much on the ball and new meats were arriving at the table almost every minute that I had my card turned to green.  Overall it was probably the best experience I have had here and I have never had one that was not pleasurable.  The bottom line is that this is the only Brazilian steakhouse in Pittsburgh which is ok because it is a good one and I will definitely be back in the future.  Don't expect to get off cheap when eating here but it is still well worth the price for all of the wonderful cuts of meat that they have.",

    "text": "Decided to check this joint out when they launched a group deal.  Never had been to a Churrascaria and it was on my list, so why not?  Went for an early dinner and the dinning room was about 1/4 full.  Not sure how this translates into food quality (read turnover time), but all of the meats were great.  The two lamb preparations had a perfect level of salty, crispy, crunchy char that left me craving more and overeating until I felt like the blueberry girl from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.  I second others' comments in that the cold salad bar is definitely worth skipping.  Nothing I ran across impressed and it just stole away precious real estate from more meat.  Two things lowered this to a 3-star review.  1.)  The price.  While I enjoyed dinning here with the substantial discount, I could never bring myself to pay $40+ for this meal in the future.  2.)  The dessert.  Our waiter brought around a dessert tray with a variety of items and asked which one we would want.  The combination of how they asked, the tone of their voice, and the way they presented the option made it sound like it was included in the meal...  well they managed to fool an entire table of 6 otherwise.  ~$10 for an extremely bland piece of cheesecake left me feeling cheated and deflated after what was a fantastic foray into meat gluttony.  Pay attention to the fine print, open up your wallet, and its definitely an experience worth trying ONCE.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I have been here 7 times in 18 months. The first 3 times were amazing but it has been on a steady decline for months now. Two visits ago myself and family didn't have the best experience with undercooked and under flavored meat. Last visit prior to last night we had the same problem with old portions in the cold bar and no standard pallet cleansers to go with the meal. Last night we decided to go and give it another shot. It was the most disappointing experience we've had regarding food quality in a long time. While the waitress service was relatively good, the food was TERRIBLE. I can usually handle a medium to medium rare steak as long as it's seasoned right. Even after requesting it be more medium than rare, they still produced undercooked and extremely under seasoned meat. At one point, blood was sprayed on the shirt as the meat was being cut.   Other parts of the experience: 1. Old Italian meats on the boards, to a point of being crusted around the edges.  2. It took 30 minutes before we saw the first filet cut come around (and it was nearly rare). Quite upsetting. Not nearly as upsetting as the undercooked pork loin that came out though.   3. We saw 5 meat selections for the first 30 minutes including only shot at the picahna (supposed to be the specialty). Out of these other 4, chicken wings, sausage, beef rib, sirloin. Only one steak regularly came through, and it was the lowest quality. While the selection picked up after that the quality stayed the same.  4.  Previous visits also included grilled pineapple, but again, it seems to have disappeared off the selection list.   I thought maybe this was just a bad night, but when I consider the last three visits I have to believe that this place has dropped its standards it once lived up to. It was mine and my daughter's favorite place to eat but she was also not happy with the quality last night.   I hate to say it, but we won't be back. We have never had a bad experience at Texas de Brazil, so we will drive the extra distance to go there from now on.    This place should be better, because it HAS been better.",

Customer Service: Awesome  The price is a little steep, but you are really getting a lot for the price. This is a great little gem, and I can't wait to go back. Also this is a great place for a large party, we went in with 12-15 people (with a res of course) and they were super accommodating, everyone was very impressed with the great service. It was also a bit more fun than a regular restaurant for a large party.  Just remember, this is a meat marathon, not a sprint.",

If you think you're going get one similar anywhere else, you're not.  Try it here.  Every meat you can imagine - I prefer rare, must hubby prefers well.  We are both more than satisfied.  The grill masters have perfected the spices and you will more than satisfy your carnivorous cravings.  When the place isn't packed, which is not so often of late, the carvers will cater to your favorites - otherwise it's a constant circuit of various offerings, great variety.  My husband always goes to the hot bar...  black beans (fabulous), white rice, potatoes, soup and fish...  he's a meat-and-potatoes guy.  'Nuff said.  Now for my favorite:  the cold bar.  Marinated portabella mushrooms, asparagus, seafood salad, sushi, lox, crab legs, shrimp, seaweed salad, oysters, feta salad, olives, beets.  There is also a bread station with an enormous block of parmasean cheese.  The meat is wonderful, but this area keeps my attention - these are the things I don't often get and are what really makes this one of my favorite places!  Carrot cake?  Mile high and loaded with pistachios - we always split.  Galliano?  Finally tried it one evening - great after meal instead of dessert.    Like I said - this is our \"treat\" restaurant.  We have not been disappointed in the several years we have been patrons - you won't be either!",

    "text": "Maybe I was taken a bit off-guard when I was first introduced to the concept of a Brazilian steakhouse. I'm an Asian kid from Queens, so sue me. At best, I've had Korean barbeque (the marinate they use for that stuff is godly) and the basic cuts they have at your local outback steakhouse(I don't profess to be a fine dining guru).  Imagine my surprise, and my blissful joy when I learned of the never-ending carousel of meats that is Green Forest Churrascaria.  So first thing's first: THE MEATS, Green Forest Churrascaria is nothing without its meats. Sure they have a decent selection of side dishes and anti-pastis to pair with their never ending grind of quality meats. But it does not compare with the variety of cuts, filet Mignons, top sirloins, and tenderloins that their waiters sprint to and from the kitchen with. My experience here was top-notch, as I took the (very wise) advice of my friend to fast the entire day before my meal. I decided to run through the entire merry go-round of meats before I went for any seconds.   My personal advice? If you're a quality meats kind of guy, you'll stay away from some of the lower cuts, (especially anything wrapped with bacon. I know you're going to complain but hear me out first). SAVE SPACE for the quality, I'm talking about the filet-mignon and the pork ribs. These cuts have that melt-off-the-bone quality that I imagine high-class establishments would have (If I'd ever been to one). Most of the steaks they serve are packed full of rich savory flavor, and have no need of any kind of sauce or cheese. Let your personal taste dictate your preference. My recommendation is to space out your nonstop meat binges with sprinkles of cinnamon pineapple slices and the occasional green to keep your palate oiled, and your gut going strong.  If I were not a lowly college senior, I'd dine in Brazillean cutlet heaven every night. But the sad truth is that I live on a budget. So naturally, price is my biggest complaint about this establishment. But given the amount of meat you receive, and the lack of limitations to the cuts that you'll eat here, I don't think any of you will gripe too much over the cost. For the Pittsburgh local who loves his/her meats, give it a shot. I guarantee you wont regret it.",

Green Forest is a Brazilian restaurant that cooks meats the same way and is the closest thing to Argentinean asado. You wont need to add any sauces or spices to their meats.  I no longer eat red meat but my husband does, he's been to Argentina and he loves a good churrasco or asado so imagine how exited he gets when we get to go to Green Forest.  As for me, I've been a pescatarian for six years. Their salad bar is FANTASTIC. **Vegetarians, or vegans: they have everything and anything you can think of. **  I'm sure you already read somewhere here about the red and green coasters (or wood pieces) they have on each table to let the servers know if you're ready for more meat.  Don't forget to try their succulent deserts, their flan is my favorite.",

    "text": "Im not much of a carnivore but my hubby of course loves meat. I decided to try this place after a neighbor suggested it. They have a small buffet that consist of brazilian style side dishes along with some italian and asian favorites.  The interior has a calm intimate setting with plenty of seating enough for a party if you needed it to be. The server greets you immediately and if you're a new comer as we were they inform you of what Churrascaria is and they bring out these tasty appetizers for your table even though you have a whole buffet and delicious meats waiting for you.   We ordered a brazillian beer called Xingu which is dark like a lager but smooth like a light beer. We loved it! the appetizers were like a fried banana, some kind of potato and even their version of what i would call cheese sticks only it was bread with melted mozzarella cheese inside. great!!  So they give you this wooden coaster that has a red and green side to it to inform them that you want them to bring meat to the table. Green for go; Red for stop. whatever you do don't leave the green side up cause that means they will keep bringing meat stick after stick. The best part is that there are over 20 different varieties of delectable juicy meats to choose from. Prime rib, bacon wrapped filet mignon and chicken and turkey for the non red meat eaters.  The salad bar was still my favorite because of all the exotic treats they had. Everything that i'd want in a salad they had it. Even sushi, mussles, ray oysters, crab legs, breads with olive and fresh olives, garlic and plenty of other fine toppings. Home made dressing and even hot sides like rice, scallop potatoes, seafood melody and 2 kinds of soup. It was amazing the choices they had and i would honestly suggest staring for a few days before going here. it's about $40 a person without drinks so whenever you go make sure you get your moneys worth!!",

    "text": "I had a rough time deciding how to review Green Forest. It has some amazing pros... but some pretty terrible cons at the same time. Let's just say that Green Forest is lucky that a Fogo de Chao hasn't opened in Pittsburgh. Otherwise, I'm pretty sure Green Forest would be out of business.  The hubby and I dined at Green Forest for the first time on Friday night with a large party. First impressions were a little rough. The restaurant is located in an office complex-type building. While trying to figure out where we were going, I felt like we were headed for either the dentist or to apply for a home loan.  The interior was even worse than the exterior. It was dark and dreary, circa 1994. The bar was very dated, and an adjacent \"living room\" area was cluttered with firewood and random stuff. Unfortunately, I had to go to the bathroom a couple of times over the four hours that we drank and dined there. The bathrooms were located down a creepy, medical-style corridor and were in terrible shape for a restaurant that charges $40 per plate.   The salad bar area seemed a little arbitrary to me. I would have enjoyed more options for a lettuce salad and traditional sides (say, potatoes or pasta) as opposed to the assorted offerings of soup, sides, cheese, sushi, pasta salads, etc. I tried a strange side that looked deliciously cheesy and saucy... until I realized that fish was part of the concoction, too. I was also challenged by the fact that there were only tiny bowls at the salad bar as opposed to full sized plates. It really limited the amount of things that I was able to get at one time.  However, despite being disappointed by the salad bar, I was not disappointed by the meat! Wow, the meat was incredible!! This was the one area of the restaurant that I thought was better than its Fogo de Chao competition. Most of the Green Forest meats were cooked rare or medium rare, which I absolutely love. However, a friend of ours barely ate any of the beef options because they were practically mooing, as I like to say. Of course, the major disadvantage of cooking the meat so rare is alienating some of the customers.  Finally, customer service was excellent compared to most restaurants, but not as amazing for a Brazilian restaurant. I don't think there were enough employees walking the meats around, and I only saw a few of my favorite cuts a couple times. I was also never so overwhelmed by meat that I had to turn my card over to \"No.\" And yes, being overwhelmed is a great feeling in a Brazilian restaurant!  My recommendation to customers would be to check out this restaurant if you've never eaten at a Brazilian place before. My recommendation to the owners would be to upgrade the decor to take them from a 3 star to a 4 star establishment.",

I've been there several times; I'd go back any time someone else was paying. And maybe if I was paying, once a year. The meats are cooked well and they have a nice assortment; the accompanying salad/seafood bar is also pretty high quality.",

    "text": "I haven't been to this establishment since 2010 and a friend of mine wanted to celebrate his birthday here so we went! First of all it is pricy around $44.50 per person if you get the full salad bar, hot plates, and meat. They do though have other options and a bar menu which I didn't really look over. They did have a nice drink/ wine selection that was a bit to over priced for me but my guest did enjoy 2 of there signature drinks which was a Caipirinha for 9 bucks a pop. The ambiance was nice it was very quite and mellow with interesting decor.  Now as for the food it was excellent except for a few things but that was personal preference to taste. As for salads they had a sea weed salad, mixed green salad, and caesar salad. I had some of the Caesar salad which was good and a ton of seafood. I even tried there octopus which I never had and it was delicious. The hot bar had some kind of fish stew which was ok and a few other things I really wasn't interested in. They also had a little side table with meats and salamis along with a decent cheese selection which was to die for. I love garlic and they had these whole roasted fatal if cloves marinated in some Rosemary marinade that I swear I could of ate the whole bowl!  As for the grilled meats you flip a little coaster red means stop and green means bring on the meat! Some of the meats were fantastic but some were not for me which came back to my taste. They were cooked perfectly and they did ask how you wanted stuff cooked too. Over all I loved the experience I would come here again but probably tweak the menu to my liking probably just stick with the salad bar since I'm a seafood lover. My biggest downfall was they DO NOT label all the foods and I didn't know what I was eating half the time and had to guess. Wish they would label stuff",

I've been to a Churrascaria before and the salad bar selection was very limited and the meats have been horribly overcooked. Not so here! The cold bar had dried meats, cheeses, cold salads and fish. Everything I tried was delicious.   The meats were fantastic, as well. They were perfectly cooked and tasted amazing. Some were parmesean crusted, another marinated in some sort of pesto. Even the chicken, which often is horribly overcooked, was amazing. We had lamb, beef, turkey wrapped in bacon, and chicken.   The service deserves a mention. The host let us try a taste of wine before committing to a whole bottle of it. We missed the chicken so the gentleman went into the kitchen and returned in about 5 minutes with a skewer of it.   It's a bit pricey, but about the same as I've seen other at similar restaurants. For all you can eat, I think it was a fair price. We have family coming to town later this month and we absolutely plan to take them here!",

    "text": "After years of being guilty of \"judging a book by its cover,\" I finally caved and gave Green Forest a try. I thought, \"there's absolutely no way a Brazilian churrascaria in an old business park in Monroeville is going to be good!\" Well, I was completely wrong.  Yeah, the small business park vibe, old building, and outdated decor paints an odd picture, but the food more than makes up for how far the first impression may set you back. The staff is wonderful, attentive, and very, VERY nice. In fact, once we told our server that one of the girls in our group was pregnant, they took extra care to make sure they brought her the fully-cooked pieces of meat (even going so far as to bring around a smaller table-side skillet to finish cooking her pieces while serving the rest of us.   As for the food...we didn't really keep count on our first visit, but we counted EIGHTEEN different meat offerings the second time around: rotisserie chicken, ribeye, Brazilian sausage, top sirloin, flank, sirloin with chimichurri, picanha, parmesan filet mignon, thick-cut bacon, pork tenderloin, leg of lamb, turkey wrapped in bacon, lamb chops, bacon-wrapped filet, beef rib, baby back ribs, beef tenderloin, and filet topped with a mushroom wine sauce. Our previous trip also included a garlic-infused sirloin that was incredible. Overall, the meats - while salty in their own right - don't hit the overwhelming sodium levels that you get at some churrascarias. I ate nearly every cut of meat (most two or three times, actually), and left there feeling full, but not bloated and miserable. Of course, part of that may have come down to the fact that we got there right when the restaurant opened both times. In both cases, we barely had enough time to explore the salad bar before the meat began making its rounds, which means we didn't fill up on the salad bar items. In fact, both times, I never even took a second look at the salad bar because the meat came around so fast and so frequently that all other items were quickly forgotten.  When thinking about the sides and desserts, I wasn't in love with their pao de queijo, but that doesn't mean it's not good. (also, meant that I didn't fill up on bread!). Also, the fried yuca and bananas are quite yummy. You'll need to ask for those items, though, as they don't automatically bring them out to you. Dessert isn't included in the price, and while decent and made in-house, I wouldn't recommend the tiramisu unless you really enjoy a liquor flavor. I found it quite strong in my serving. Perhaps a heavy hand, perhaps the norm...either way, I'd recommend having an extra cut of meat or two instead!  Now, while the salad bar and I didn't spend much time getting to know each other, I can say that Green Forest does put out a commendable assortment of offerings. You standard beans and rice, hearts of palm, cheeses and charcuterie are on display, as well as some sushi, lobster mashed potatoes, soups and salads, etc. I have no complaints about the salad bar, but let's be real here: If you're at a churrascuria, you're there to eat meat, and that's truly where Green Forest shines.  It's an unpretentious environment, with phenomenal service, excellent food, and reasonable prices. As people who live in the city, I can tell you that we are willing to drive the sometimes-torturous \"short\" distance to Green Forest instead of the 5-minute drive to Texas de Brazil any day of the week. It's definitely worth it! Enjoy!",

    "text": "Went by last night for dinner with my son.  I had not been there in YEARS!    Let's talk about the good stuff first:    - the MEAT is magnificent, especially the beef tenderloin.  I did not go there for chicken, sausage or turkey, so I stuck with beef and lamb.   Each variety was done perfectly and spiced just right.     - the SERVICE was excellent.  The waitstaff kept our drink glasses filled and regularly offered \"fresh\" plates.   The meat servers were friendly and helpful in explaining the various cuts.     The mediocre:  - the BUFFET seemed tired and less-than-fresh.  Maybe it was because it was a Thursday night.  That's a possible reason but not an excuse.  We were paying $42 per person last night just like someone would on a weekend.   The food bowls were half-full, at best.  The lettuce was wilted.  The sushi tasted FAR too cold, which led us to believe that it had not been fresh that evening.  The vegetables were soft.  The shrimp was rubbery.  Not much in the way of salad condiments, either.   You would think that the owners would load up tons of great, fresh (and relatively inexpensive)  food on the buffet as a way for us to take up space in our stomachs.  The more we eat from the buffet, the less we consume of the expensive meat.  Oh well...  The poor:  - the DECOR isn't just dated, it's non-existent.  It feels like a cafeteria with the lights turned down low.  The chairs are institutional.  The tables are bare (but painted, I assume, in some kind of festive Brazilian folk style).  You're unable to get any sense of intimacy.  Nor does it feel \"classy.\"   If they can't afford to go contemporary upscale, then go for Brazilian rustic.   - the DESSERT was awful.  Just plain awful.   My son ordered a piece of chocolate cake that came as dry and hard as drywall.   The icing had a thin layer of film on it that hinted to us that it'd been in the frig too long.       Ultimately, in spite of the great meat, we were disappointed.   I might have been LESS turned off had we not been charged $42/person plus the cost of drinks and dessert.  With taxes and tip -- and no alcohol, mind you -- I dropped $120 last night on this dinner.   I don't mind paying that kind of money for dinner for two, but I expect -- and get -- more for it.",

We moved here from cleveland, and there is a Brazilian steak house there that we absolutely loved, it was the perfect spot for a special occasion dinner. So since we found this place we decided we would give it a shot. When we parked and got in the place, it was extremely busy, as most places on valentine's day, but we were greeted within 30 seconds and told we could take a seat at a waiting table or the bar or on the couch while the tables cleared out. We were 10 minutes early for our reservation so this was fine. Within five minutes we were lead to our table and another waitress came over to show us how it worked, the drink menus, and to tell us about the salad bar. As soon as we got our plates, the meat started coming in. It was terrific. I tried every kind except for the lamb because I'm not a big fan. The staff was wonderful and informative and although it was busy, never once did I feel like we were waiting. My favorite part was that refills were consistent (we just had pepsi), and even when our cards were flipped to red, if a waiter noticed we didn't try the meet yet, he would still offer. The waitress who checked up on us and brought us drinks was just terrific. She was a sweet young lady that was so attentive and kind. She even took our picture for us. I will definitely be returning, and would recommend it to anyone!",

Overall a great meal and a ton of food, you won't leave with an empty stomach that's for sure.",

    "text": "We're a family of four who have been to this restaurant twice now. The food is consistently good... some items are better than others, but everything is tasty. We go more for the experience than just the food. It is expensive, so your idea of value will depend on how much you eat. Recently we took my parents for a fun meal, so there were six of us, at $40 each. Not exactly pocket change. There was a family of three, parents and a young child, at a nearby table. The child was watching cartoons on an iPad with the volume high. I am the first to admit that it's frustrating for parents who want a nice dinner out and have to deal with a child at the same time. I get it, I do. Mine are 11 and 13 now. But I also wasn't in the mood to pay $40 per person for a special dinner and have to listen to the Looney Tunes at the same time. We asked management to please ask the parents to turn it down or use headphones. Instead of doing that, they moved the six of us to a back room, much farther from the buffet (which was not ideal for my father who is disabled). In order to have a non-cartoon accompanied meal, all six of us had to move our plates and glasses to another table. I was mortified that we had to do this and that I had to ask my parents to move shortly after we'd started our meal. If we'd gone to McDonalds I wouldn't have blinked an eye at the cartoons. But at a nice restaurant and for what we paid, I don't think it was professional of them to ask us to move. Asking the parents to turn it down wouldn't have been out of line or asking the much smaller group to move to the back. We couldn't have been the only customers not thrilled with the cartoons. We will not be returning.",

Yes  This is a past experience review. Around 7:30PM, the restaurant was not crowded and there were still available many sits there. The hostess was very friendly and nice and directed us to the table without any waiting time. The parking lot is shared with the other stores of the mall, but because it was night and most of the commerce around was closed, so we can say that was a \"private\" parking lot. The dining room was an excite place, really remembering a churrascaria on Rio de Janeiro. It made me feel home sick (what is good). The waitress was very nice and friendly and was always checking our table to see if we needed something more. Because this is a Brazilian barbeque place, my wife and I went there looking to eat a rodizio. Overall, the experience was fantastic! Because they know how to cut the meat on a Brazilian style and they offer Brazilian goodies to consume there too like Guarana or Brazilian coffee. After the dinner, I talked with the owners and found that they are Brazilians. So, if you are really looking for a place to have a real Brazilian barbeque experience around Pittsburgh, PA, this is the place. I'm still trying to find a good excuse to travel again to the city and eat there again!",

Our dinner included unlimited meats, the cold bar (salads, charcuterie, cold sides, breads), hot sides (lobster mashed potatoes, garlic-y shrimp and more I didn't get to).  All of the meats are amazing. All of them. We kept our cards green for a while so we didn't miss anything. But even when they were red, the guys still stopped by if something was a less circulated item (like the filet with Madeira mushroom sauce). Everyone that works there is wonderful. Our drinks were refilled before they were half empty.  We ate too much. Like way too much. But we weren't rushed. The options were delicious. And we'll be back next time we're in town.",

    "text": "The Green Forest Brazilian Restaurant is a great special occasion choice. It is an all you can eat style with a variety of fabulous food. I believe they have over 16 or 17 meat selections alone. They also have a hot and cold buffet, which is an expansive area in addition to the meats served table side. Our gang referred to the service as \"swords of meat\".   The cold bar consists of many salads shrimp cocktail, oysters on the half shell, sushi and sashimi. The Portabella salad was delicious as well as the grilled asparagus.   On the hot buffet they have Lobster mashed potatoes and Paella.  \\ For dessert we enjoyed the coconut flan and passion fruit mousse (when tried together was the perfect combination of sweet & tart) which were both good. There were many other options too. Please be aware that desserts may NOT be included in your special, so please check. They also have a well stocked bar. If you have a big appetite especially for meat, this is the certainly the place to go.  Check out their website for specials. I have also seen GROUPON specials from time to time too. On Tuesdays and Thursdays they have an early bird special from 4 - 6 PM: $37 instead of $42.50.  Service was attentive and pleasant. Also be aware that this restaurant is not visible from the main road (Rodi Rd), but it sits up in an office complex, conveniently located right off the parkway east, Penn Hills exit.",

Green Forest is kind of hidden in the ground floor of an office building, but it made for easy parking.  Wait staff was excellent and very attentive. Had some lobster mashed potatoes, meat, and cheeses to start then got into the meats. They had a large variety of cuts of steak, lamb, chicken, and turkey. The parmesan-crusted sirloin was my favorite. The meats, even the parmesan-crusted ones, were all very moist and tender.  The restaurant facility is fairly plain but nicely kept. The only thing I can really ding the restaurant on is the restrooms, which appeared to be shared with other tenants in the building. They were OK but definitely weren't as clean as I would have liked, especially for a (high-priced) eatery.  This is a good celebration-type restaurant. I can't afford to eat here very often, but it's a nice option when you want to splurge.",

    "text": "Maybe I've been held hostage by Pittsburgh for too long (best major city I've been in - the food... not so much), but I've come to have a much higher regard for Green Forest. I've gone another half dozen or so times since the initial review due to the relative lack of good dining options in the city, and there's definitely a few really good points about it.  Food: The blandness of the grilled foods I spoke of in first review is highly variable, and I think I initially caught them on a bad night. If I were to estimate, I'd say that out of five random visits, one would be bland, three good, and one too salty. This odd diversity is distributed among the different cuts of meat offered, with the most variable being the leg of lamb, which has had entirely different flavors on different occasions.  And you know what? That's not a bad thing, given that I prefer to haunt restaurants I like rather than test a whole bunch of mediocre ones. I also appreciate the occasional change in salad bar offerings. I would say that on any given night, 85% of the offerings are fairly good-tasting, and that's enough, given that every dish being delicious to everyone is not a reasonable expectation.  Atmosphere: Actually, about as variable as the food. During busy nights, it's absolutely festive, with birthday cheer for all ages, young couples in the midst of impressing each other, and stout men in some form of informal meat eating contest. During slow times, it's quiet, though never quite gets to being truly intimate - probably because the number of servers dancing around the tables doesn't really allow it. Not really a problem, though.  Service: Very, very friendly, and generally very prompt.  Price: It stings. I'm still not convinced that it can't be done for cheaper, especially being in an unassuming outlying office building. This is where a star comes off, leaving the establishment at a four for me. I think if my red meat tastes ran beef rather than lamb, it'd probably remain at a five.  Is it possible that I'm starting to suffer some kind of strange Stockholm Syndrome from the dearth of restaurants to my tastes in Pittsburgh? Perhaps, but that doesn't change the fact that Green Forest has become one of only three restaurants in Pittsburgh that I visit on rotation. It's among the best that the Pittsburgh area has to offer.",

    "text": "We have been going to Green Forest yearly for 6 years now and they never disappoint. Never. Even though the price seems steep, when I think about all of the food we get there and what normal restaurants charge for a basic steak dinner... I would rather go to Green Forest hands down.   Not only do they have superb service but the food is plentiful, high quality and interesting. The large array of meats they present is vast and the spices and styles they infuse are just as numerous. It also seems endless because they are constantly rolling out new carts or spits of sizzling, freshly cooked meats that make your mouth water.    When you are overloaded with meat and need a break, there is the cold foods bar, hot sides bar and  the cheese/bread bar I always hit up. The cold bar has some of the best oysters, sushi and seafood salads I have ever had. Hot foods are more of a filler with rice,  potatoes and more...so as a small girl I ignore those. Cheese/Bread has at least 6 different high quality cheeses and the bread assortment is great and homemade.   Favorites for our last visit was the filet mignon with mushroom cabernet sauce, prime rib, parmesan encrusted filet, chimichurri top sirloin and the sushi. All time favorite is the sword fish with passion fruit sauce. Sushi there as mangos, strawberries and so many other abnormal but delicious accents that you will have to pace yourself.   They are more of a dinner place during the week and they have odd opening hours on the weekend but it gets busy after 7pm. Make sure you get a reservation and eat a lot of food the day before to streach your stomach...as my husband akways says. :)",

It's definitely a meat eaters paradise, but for don't be discouraged if meat isn't your thing, because there are plenty of other options as well.  It's the same concept as Texas de Brazil, only it's locally owned and it's less pricey.  You'll pay about $45 per person, but it's all you can eat and the food is very high quality, especially the meat dishes.  I did try 1 or 2, and they were very good.  My husband took advantage of just about everything they came around with, and he certainly was satisfied.  I will say, the buffet portion probably wouldn't satisfy everybody- it's not your typical \"buffet food\", but there certainly is a variety to choose from.    Our service was very good and she was very nice.  I mean, what else can I say?  That about sums it up.. we went for the food, but the good service was a bonus.  The location is a little odd, and is easy to miss if you aren't looking for it.  It's not a place you'll stop at because you see if from the road or drive by it multiple times.  It's located up on the hill away from the mail road, on the bottom floor of an office building.  I have driven Rodi Road hundreds of times, and I never even knew it was there.  I thought my gps had taken us to the wrong place, until we pulled into the parking lot.  So keep an eye out when you're driving there!",

The side dishes are not great - the cheese biscuits were rock hard and cold and the plantains were greasy - but you don't really need them at all. The seafood and salad bar is insane! It has raw, cooked, pickled, and fresh veg; sushi, shrimp, and lobster smashed potatoes; meats and cheeses; cold and warm salads; hot bar with soup, rice and beans, potatoes, etc. - generally, everything you need to accompany the symphony of meats.  Come hungry and ready to pace yourself, as every single meat I tasted -- from the sausages to the ribs to the steaks to the chops to the straight up slab bacon -- was 100% perfectly cooked and flavorful through and through. The servers were fast and courteous and made sure to stop by our table with each item that came out of the kitchen.  The wine list is small but curated and cocktails are strong. The dessert cart is everything you'd want for a post-meat coma: fruit tarts, chocolate mousse, flans and brulees, and usually a giant slice of some decadent cake.  Overall, Green Forest Churrascaria is worth every penny of what some would consider to be a pricey meal; however, I challenge you to compose this sort of extravagant meal on you own. Can't be done.",

We were seated and then our friendly server informed us how the restaurant worked.  It was a buffet of appetizers and sides and then you were to flip a card from red to green to have the servers bring you different selections of meat.    I started with the sides.  I skipped the salads although they looked tasty carbs were calling my name.  I choose to start with some sushi, cheese, lobster mashed potatoes and shrimp cocktail.  The sushi roll I had was topped with what appeared to be Frenches Onion straws and it was excellent.  Great flavor and perhaps not traditional (although I am not a sushi expert) it was the best I have ever had.  What was also wonderful was the lobster mashed potato.  When I scooped a spoonful onto my plate I was surprised to find and entire section of claw meat.  They definitely did not skimp on the lobster.    When we flipped to green and began getting our meat it was all very good.  My favorite was the filet.  I had it with bacon wrapped around it but I was more interested in the flier which was tender melt in your mouth.  Some things to keep in mind for next time....The meat was very salty.  I kind of got sick of it after a few rounds.  The potatoes although filled with lobster were also very saltily.  I am a big fan of salt but on the meat it was just too much.  Also the meat was always medium or close to rare a few times.  If you do not eat anything but well done this might not be the place for you.  I was just selective and tried to ask for an end piece but a few times I could not eat what they cut because it was just too red for me.",

    "text": "I have been to a few Brazilian Steakhouses in my time, but I have to say that the overall best experience that I have ever had at one was here at the Green Forest.   Is it a bit out of date looking? Is it in an obscure business park that you wouldn't know would house this place? The answers are both yes.  But the thing that is amazing about this place... Service, food taste, choices, and overall general experience.  What you lack in aesthetics, is made up for in great meat, friendly and helpful staff (they made sure they cooked meats well done on a separate little grill for our pregnant friend), and a generally great time. We counted at least 13 different meat options, there were probably more.  I think we actually ate 13.  The salad and hot bar has so much to choose from too.  And they have additional sides that you can get too (can you say cheesy bread balls and even French fries... Yes, fries... But I love all fries).  Only thing not included in the price is the beer and liquor, and desserts.  Seriously, the service here was amazing. I definitely recommend checking it out!!!",

We have another Brazilian steakhouse called Texas de Brazil and while they serve decent food and have a bigger space, Green Forest has the superior quality food and service. I've brought dates, family, friends I even had my birthday dinner here before that's how much I like it. Literally everything they serve is delicious I can't decide what to recommend but one of my favorites was the bacon wrapped fillet. To. Die. For! Be prepared to spend a little money but it's worth it without question.",

    "text": "I came here with my old roommate for his birthday.  I figured we'd try something different than what is typically found around the city and he definitely likes to try the fancier things.  As my fiance is not a huge fan of meats, this was a great excuse to go with him.  This is my first and only Brazilian steakhouse experience, and it'll be very hard to top!  The restaurant is pretty easy to get to.  It's about a half a mile off the parkway and you can actually see the building as you get off the exit.  This steakhouse is an all you can eat one where someone walks around with skewers of meat to place on your plate.  They had 18 different varieties and we got to eat about 10 different kinds of meat.  It was wonderful, the amount given to you is just enough to keep you wanting more.  My favorite was a garlic steak and a Parmesan filet mignon.  Some of the meat can be a little rare depending on what cut you get.  They also have a  separate cold buffet portion  which includes cheeses, bread, sushi and shrimp, and some other specialty cold dishes. There is so much food lined up on the buffet it's hard to get to sample all of it in one visit.  The sushi was much better than expected, and I tried some various vegetable prepared dishes and they were wonderful as well.   Make sure you come hungry when you visit!  There is so much great food to try and don't be afraid you won't get enough steak.  The staff did a wonderful job consistently offering more meats so that your plate was never with it for long.  My roommate got a couple drinks for dinner as well and they were very reasonably priced.  Overall just a really cool experience and I have yet to see anything like this in the Pittsburgh area.  Would highly recommend this for a special occasion!",

We had the green buttons on go for the better part of the first hour we were there.  I only ate meat.  A few in my party ventured up to the seafood part of the restaurant.  Off the top of my head I ate: bacon wrapped turkey, rotisserie bacon, other bacon, prok, rotisserie chicken, sirloin, bacon wrapped filet, Parmesan filet, beef short ribs, siracchia chicken, ribeye, and a few other kinds of steak that had a special marinade that I can't remember but were tasty.  At the top of my list were the Parmesan filet, bacon wrapped turkey, and short ribs.  Totally full of flavor.  Most beef was cooked around medium or lower.  Some a little salty more than others.  We paid approximately 45.00 per person.  We ate solid for 75 minutes.  Meal and service was fantastic.  Dessert is not included.  I wouldn't come here weekly but when you do visit, it is quite worthwhile.  Keep up the good work.",

Once inside, I was still worried as the decor is somewhat dated...and that's when you truly realize the old adage is True - you can't judge a book by its cover.  This place is a phenomenal churrascaria!  Over twenty varieties of meats, served gaucho-style with a certified, rock-star cold bar including sushi, various cold cuts and cheeses, salads, and more!  This place is certainly on par or better than ANY major Brazilian steakhouse I've ever been to in ANY major city around the US.   Come hungry and leave happy...with a belly full of meat. Truly delicious...just bring your appetite, take your time, and enjoy the variety.  Flavorful and plentiful food with super friendly service...sim, por favor!!",

    "text": "My wonderful, loving boyfriend decided to surprise me during Pittsburgh's Restaurant Week with reservations to Green Forest last night (Thursday evening).  Such a supportive move knowing I started a very strict diet at the beginning of the week!!!  In any case, our experience here was great.  It wasn't very busy despite being Restaurant Week and a Thursday evening, but with the location, I'm not sure how packed it gets.  It's a strange location for such a place, but I am always a fan of restaurants that are off the beaten path (they're the best!).  We were promptly seated and everyone serving us was extremely friendly and polite.  The two men serving the meats were cordial and appropriate without being overbearing or too formal and our waiter took great care of us.  I decided to not get the meats because I figured I would have more than enough options with the three food bars.  The cold food bar included a lot of different salad mixes, sushi and other raw fish, plus vegetables. Everything I tried was really good.  The side bar had cured meats and cheeses. All were excellent.  The hot foods bar included rice and beans, a seafood in coconut, some type of chicken? dish and soup.  I only tried the seafood in coconut sauce and it was amazing.  It had was loaded with tender, fresh seafood in a Thai-style sauce making it more of a soup/stew.  I could have eaten that as my meal alone.  Bobby ended up ordering the full-service menu that included the meats ($35 for the week) and he had some REALLY good stuff.  Rotisserie chicken, parmesan filet, filet in a creamy mushroom sauce, top sirloin, skirt steak, some type of garlic roasted beef were some of his favorites and that didn't even include the things he didn't try like the lamb.  Everything looked really great and the servers remembered he preferred his meat more well done, so they made sure to circle back around to him for the end pieces.  I tried a couple small bites and everything was extremely flavorful and cooked perfectly.  My favorite, though, was the grilled pineapple!!  I do have one complaint, however...and that is that it was absolutely freezing inside the restaurant.  To the point where both of our hands were frozen and my nose was running.  And there is nothing I hate more than sitting in a cold restaurant.  We will have to make another trip here on a planned cheat day when I can really go to town with all the food goodness.  I just hope the heat it is warmer next time.  Very good little hidden spot. 5 stars!",

We were a party of 3, with reservations for mid afternoon. We were seated quickly, and were greeted by a well picked over and sad salad bar. Many items were missing and not replenished, including the very important chimichurri sauce. Oh well. We'll just focus on the meats. We were seated in a room with a number of large parties. Over and over again, the servers brought skewers to the large parties and skipped our table entirely. We did not receive many of the selections, and the ones we did receive were the cold bits at the end of the skewers. When we asked a server for assistance, we were told they were understaffed and doing their best. Yikes. It's Fathers Day. In a restaurant that is all about grilled meat. At a cost close to $50 per person. Unbelievable. I don't understand why restaurants do not staff up for holidays, and why they accept reservations they cannot handle. We have been fans of Green Forest, but today was so off the charts bad, it will be a long time before we return. To be honest, we have had bad experiences on Mother's Day and Fathers Day at many Pittsburgh restaurants. It's a racket and we're done.",

The oysters were very sub par and it had a \"cheap buffet\" vibe. I would say only 4 out of the 18 meats were memorable. The chatecurie board that's supposedly included in the price is actually just apart of the buffet and is just a couple different meats and cheeses. The cheeses that were included were hard and dried up. It was definitely a different experience but not nearly worth the almost $200 we spent.",

To begin the meal, we enjoyed the buffet area, which has some hot items, a charcuterie area, a seafood and salad bar. There were these grilled egg plant slices that were incredible. We both enjoyed a glass of red wine with our meal (14 Hands Merlot and a Brazilian Cab Franc) which paired nicely with the endless amounts of red meat. The staff does an excellent job at ensuring each cut they bring to your table is the correct temperature. All of the steaks we enjoyed were seasoned very well and had their own unique flavor profiles. The pace at which the meat is brought to you is consistent, you aren't really ever just sitting there waiting for food to come around. The Pao de Queijo (Brazilian cheese bread) is plentiful and delicious as well. We also had tiramisu for dessert, which was yummy. Overall this is an experience that warrants the price. Good food is important, but the service at this establishment is what really creates the experience. If you are looking for a unique dining experience, this is definitely a restaurant I would recommend!",

    "text": "Went here based on the generally very good reviews. We normally go to Texas de Brazil and wanted to compare the two. It's in a very strange location (an awkwardly located office park/complex) and kind of looks like a doctors office on the outside, and could be difficult to find at night.  First, Green Forest get 5 stars for service and friendliness. I cannot stress enough how great the entire staff was. Texas de Brazil's service is always very so-so and sometimes downright bad. Service is where Green Forest shines!  Since you're coming here for the meat, let's talk about that... The selection and variety at Green Forest is awesome and they are cooked extremely well. I always feel that Texas de Brazil is extremely salty and over seasoned and this isn't the case here. GF wins in this category.  The biggest disappointment at Green Forest were the sides. While not bad, they just weren't great and Texas de Brazil does it better. After pouring through yelp reviews and seeing all the pictures and reviews about lobster mashed potatoes, lobster rice, sushi, seafood salads etc, Green Forest had none of these items on our recent visit and instead had mediocre things such as plain rice, plain mashed potatoes, mushy over cooked shrimp and a few other items. Don't get me wrong, they were ok, but didn't come close to living up to our expectations. At more than $100 for dinner for two, the sides should be much more impressive (maybe they are on some nights?)  Overall, Green Forest is very good and the service is the best I've had at ANY restaurant and that goes a long way with me. Priced similarly to Texas de Brazil, perhaps we caught them on an off night, but If they would step it up on the sides Green Forest would be a real home run.",

But like a geode, it's this lovely, expensive gem of a place that's totally worth the price of admission.  Why?  ...because THEY HAVE THE MEATS!!  Cow, pig, chicken, turkey, lamb, shrimp and lobster.  I see your Arby's commercials and I raise you unlimited rashers of slow-cooked tastiness fit for a king - if that king was a sharp-toothed T-Rex.  My first trip was the \"amateur\" side, but even that was impressive, with piles of lobster claws in (very little) rice, colossal shrimp, prosciutto, sopresetta and a full salad bar.  Next was the non-stop meat round and it was awesome.  Steaks, roasts, sausage, some phenomenal lamb chops, lots of items wrapped in bacon...  Funniest thing heard all day:  \"Sir, would you like some rotisserie thick-cut bacon, fresh out of the flames?\"  Why yes, yes I would!  #omnomnom  Service was excellent, food was awesome and the Only thing i would avoid is the bitter-tart passion fruit mousse (yecch!), which obliterated the nice meat mojo I had going at the end.  Other than that (and the whole nondescript thing), my meal was great as it was the last two times I was here.",

    "text": "By my count we now have three Brazilian steakhouse style restaurants in Pittsburgh, but this one is the OG. You're probably familiar with the general idea, but in case you're not, this is an all you can eat establishment. You pay a hefty but reasonable sum of money to sit down and then fresh cuts of meat brought directly to your table, somewhere in the vicinity of eighteen different varieties. And they keep coming until you tell them to stop. It's a fantastic concept. There's a salad bar with high quality side dishes available so you have something besides meat, and unlimited bread and other warm sides are included in your meal and brought to the table. You won't leave hungry.  I've never had any complaints about the service here, but your main server is just here to clear plates and bring drinks. You might want to consider a reservation with a large party or on the weekends. A standard selection of beer, wine, and spirits is available. The decor may be a little dated, but I promise you won't care. Remember, it's the OG.  I have yet to try the newest Brazilian steakhouse in Pittsburgh, but of the other two, this one is my favorite. The other one utilizes a cooking method with their meats involving rock salt to bring out the juiciness and flavor of the meats. I suppose it's effective in that regard, but the meat still comes out a little salty for my tastes. To my knowledge, Green Forest does not do this, and I prefer it that way. This is definitely a solid meal, and great for groups or special occasion dining.",

The meat had good flavor and a wide selection of red meat was offered. They skillfully offered an array of cooking levels (well done to med rare). I only recall 1 chicken and 1 pork dish being offered, but that's fine...I preferred the reds. I especially enjoyed their Brazillian preparations; the Brazillian style sausage really surprised me. I was expecting regular old sausage and suspected they were simply affixing a Brazillian label to add appeal, but it really did taste different; not something I had ever had before. - The buffet area was equally as impressive. I really enjoyed being able to sample the traditional dishes like Tabouleh and Brazillian black beans. Seafood (shrimp, mussels, clams) quality was very good...hard to find good seafood. Liked the Charcuterie addition. - Loved the waitstaff & service here. Kind, attentive, thoughtful. - The only non-positive aspect that comes to mind was the atmosphere. The decor and layout were fine, food was well displayed, but there weren't many people there. Normally that is a plus for me, but the lack of people caused them to only light one room and gave a somewhat empty feel to the place. Our reservations were for 6 pm on a Friday, so maybe it was the early crowd. - This is a restaurant you want to be hungry for and to try everything you need to exercise patience  If you havent been, you need to go!",

The fact that this is an independent restaurant makes me respect it more.   I personally think the meat at Green Forest is the best tasting compared to Fogo or Texas de Brazil. There's overall better cuts of meat and better flavor. I found that the other establishments I've been to, the meat has either been too salty or too cooked (chewy and burnt). One thing to note is shared appetizers such as fried plantains and cheese bread are not included and must be ordered separately. The cheese bread was not good, but still edible. It tasted like the bread might've been made with 95% tapioca and just a little bit of cheese. They did not serve plantains but did have fried bananas which definitely satisfied my need for some sweetness during my meal.   The dining room is a little dated in my opinion. The decor could definitely use an update. However, this minor setback did not scare away the customers. The dining room was still packed and lively, filled with many happy families and friends.   I would recommend this place if you are in the area. It's a little difficult to find because it is nestled on top of a hill. However, the service and quality of the meat is great! I left this restaurant satisfied.",

All of the restaurant staff were really talkative and we had a nice chat with everyone there. The place is small and intimate but I would choose this place over places like Fogo de Chao and Texas de Brazil, any day. It's just a totally different atmosphere and I loved it.   All of the cuts of meat were so good. They even had crispy pork belly, which was awesome! Most places don't serve different kinds of pork belly, in my experience. They also brought around fresh pieces of garlic bread the same way that they serve the meats and it was AWESOME. Everything was really good and I was told that they usually have sushi and sashimi which is what would make this place really stand out from other similar Brazilian steakhouses, but unfortunately they didn't have it. They only had smoked salmon and oysters out that night, but they were still really good. Their cold bar is probably smaller than others but everything was delicious and super fresh. My favorite was their corn...   All in all, I would definitely come here again, given the chance. Brazilian steakhouses are pretty pricey, so definitely come hungry and/or for a special occasion, but Green Forest is definitely a solid choice.",

The buffet seemed like it had a better selection of items then TDB. All on that was good. The meat selection I thought tasted better then TDB. The lamb was my favorite. Only a few things were off from what I expect. The thing about this restaurant that would really get me to return was the service. There were so many people who were checking in on us. Like it seemed every few minutes. Over all I liked the experience and if you care about the food and being treated well... come here. If you care about looks you will want TDB.",

This is owned by a Brazilian family that tries their hardest to give their patrons a True Churrascaria experience.   I was very impressed with everything - from their awesome, friendly servers to their food.  Food ---- I was all in.   The salad bar has some killing, ultra large oysters.   These oysters were terrific.   I was totally shocked how good and tasty they were.   I ate at least 10 - I came here for meat, but they were that good.  I also had about a dozen extra large shrimp, yummy.    The salad bar has warm food and I tried it all, it was okay, but I really was focused on the seafood.     The meats - I could not keep up.   I think there was 17 rounds.   Which means 17 different meats.   I focused on the Pecanha, Filet Mignon, Bacon wrapped Turkey and Pork Belly.  I am not sure if Pecanha and Rump Roast are the same, they differentiate here, both are excellent.   What I like with this place is that I can special order the cut, unlike some of the chain Churrascaria's which try to limit the higher end cuts from circulation on the floor.  Excellent service, excellent family run business, excellent meat!!!!   It is worth at least a visit.......",

This is the first Churrascaria I went too and it makes me want to try multiple other Brazilian steakhouses.  The first time I was there I assumed there was a dress code, but there wasn't. This does not mean you can come in sweat pants, good advice is to dress slightly better than normal. Or just ask your best mate... his advice is better than mine. Talking about your best mate you should tag him along as this place is way more enjoyable with over 4 people.   The food is pristine, there is usually around 16-20 fancy cuts going in rotation. An there wasn't a food that was carted around that i didn't like. my favorite being the Hanger steak with garlic, and the Brazilian sausage. The meat is 10/10 but it does't carry the restaurant single handedly as the fried bananas and salad bar are on the T.  I remember the servers being very nice also.

I think because this is a smaller restaurant, they don't have as much turnover so the circulating steaks are way too tough and over cooked. I always ask for rare pieces, but the best they could do was medium rare. I also found all the steaks consistently lacking in the garlic taste that I expect from Brazilian BBQ. They really need to work on seasoning and cooking their meats properly.   The salad bar was also lacking in a variety of fresh greens. Unless they significantly drop their prices, I can't see why anybody would choose to come here. I encourage people to review the photos for this restaurant and gauge the doneness and dryness of the meat. Trust your eyes. Avoid coming here.",

    "text": "I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses so this concept was not new to me. You get a card that's green on one side and red on another. Green means go and red means stop. Waiters walk around with meat and whichever color you have exposed let's them know whether you want more or not.   I came to Green Forest during restaurant week hoping this would be one of my better experiences with Brazilian steakhouses. Unfortunately, I don't think they brought out everything since the meal was discounted. I read on other reviews all the seafood they usually have but unfortunately for me, there was none when I visited. What a bummer! The buffet selection was just meh and I didn't really enjoy any of it. The only thing I enjoyed was the meat, which I found everything to be well seasoned and perfectly prepared. However, there's only so much meat I can have in one sitting; I like to have more variety with my meals.   I doubt I will return to Green Forest even if their buffet is better. The price is a little steep at regular price and I know I would never get my money's worth.",

    "text": "18 different kinds of meat carved table side?  How can you go wrong?! I had only been to a Churrascaria once before, so I don't have the experience with the style that some other reviewers must have.  I have to say, I was impressed. You start your meal with a buffet style area that has everything from sushi to rice, pasta, cheeses, soup, etc.  A lot of good options.  But a word to the wise - don't eat too much of the \"buffet\" area because you don't want to be too full for the meat! There are coasters in front of each diner, and as long as you have it flipped up to green, they will keep bringing you meat.  And meat.  And then some more meat.  About 10 meats in, I was puzzled about what other options could even exist and then they continued to bring more meat!  My favorites were the lamb, the bacon wrapped turkey and the flank steak.  All excellently flavored and juicy.  I wished I would have brought a note pad and kept track of what I was eating because it was honestly hard to remember what everything was.  They also had an amazing grilled pineapple.  I think I had more refills on that than I did any of the types of meat.  It was grilled with cinnamon sugar and was such a perfect treat.  (my mouth is watering right now thinking of it) I went with a Meet up group and can't wait to try it again with my fiance.  Yum!",

I have been to many churrascaria and though I can't say that this is anywhere near the level of Fogo de Chao in Miami it is definitely good if you are in the mood for meat!  The husband and I were exhausted from all of the unpacking and both wanted meat!  We knew that meant a trip to Green Forest.  The salad bar has a decent selection and the hot foods even had a risotto of sorts with mushrooms that was good enough for me to go back for seconds.  The meats are delicious and they will bring you out the doneness that you prefer in my case rare to medium rare.  I tend to stick to the beef and the lamb, I tend to find the poultry overcooked and I don't eat anything that has been covered in Parmesan cheese (personal preference).  This time I also ordered a passion fruit caiprinha which was out of this world delicious.  These are too easy to drink and I made sure I only ordered the one.   Randomly the staff sang us happy birthday, because the waitress thought she overheard us talking about our birthday (we were talking about the wedding), but it was hilarious because the two of us didn't know what was going on!  Overall the service was great the food and drinks were top notch and we will return when in the mood for a meat orgy.  The price is not low but it is reasonable for the quality and quantity of food!",

    "text": "We went here after searching for good restaurants on Yelp near our hotel. Parking is easy, but the restaurant is located in an industrial area; a bit disconcerting given the type of fare offered.  First impressions: well, the menu taped to the window had a very large scary beetle-thing stuck between it and the glass window. And there were little dead tiny moths stuck to the tape. I was a bit alarmed (because the beetle is so obvious when you walk up that the staff not noticing it was scary), but since we were there with no other options, we went inside.  The other reviews about the decor were spot-on: a bit plain, but the lighting was nice.   My husband really enjoyed the meats. He probably tried about 12 of them. The hot salad bar was not for me; I don't eat meat so nothing in there really appealed to me, and although I did try the whitefish in curry sauce, it was inedible IMO.  Now, the fresh salad bar was very good. Not excellent, mind you, but very good, especially considering the type of food I'd been eating on this trip for the last few days. Other reviewers talked about the freshness of the salad bar, and I would agree with them that this restaurant needs a little more patronage so that the fresh stuff gets eaten quickly and more fresh stuff brought in. I definitely had the impression that some of the food was set out, brought back in and refrigerated, set out again, etc. In CA, we have random health inspections that rate restaurants on these issues, but unfortunately, PA doesn't seem to have these inspections posted. I imagine if this restaurant were in CA, the health grade on it would be a B.   However, despite these concerns, we did still enjoy a very nice meal. The owner came over and talked with us and was super friendly and I could tell how much of her heart was invested in her restaurant.   If you have been to Texas de Brazil, do not expect this restaurant to come close to the quality of that restaurant. If Texas de Brazil is a 10, this place is a 7.5 or an 8. But they did an admirable job for the area, and I would probably come back if we are ever in the area again. The place was pretty empty last night, but it's been raining and it was later in the evening. I would love to see this place have a ton of patronage; I think that would improve the quality and feel of the place.",

They grill a huge variety of meat including beef ribs, rib-eye, sausage, pork sirloin, garlic bread (my gf is a HUGE fan of it), etc. The meat is well-cooked and comes in big pieces as you order from the waiters who walks around tables holding a stick with grilled meat on it, and they will slice the amount you desire for you. I was unfortunate because they did not have beef *baby ribs* on that day, but the beef ribs are really flavorful, tender and juicy. They also have a small all-you-can-eat salad bar serving white shrimp, smoked salmon, portabella, sushi, tuna, etc. The hot food includes coconut fish (not so sure). The desserts come with extra charges. This place is located next to an exit of the freeway. Not very easy to find.",

They have a full bar. We found this out by taking our own beer and wine this weekend.

The decor is a bit cheesy but it is located inside of an office building in Penn Hills so it's not going to look amazing.  The salad/seafood bar has AUCE oysters, shrimp, cheeses, salad, bread, and much more.  Attempt to resist the urge to fill up on those goodies because you need to try all of the meats.  They give you either a small piece of wood or coaster with a green and red side.  When you have it on green an employee will visit you and give you a piece of meat.  From sausage to prime their meats are great quality and delicious.  Remember to turn it red side up if you do not want any as a lot of their employees do not speak English very well and since they have so many tables to visit they will give you meat and bolt.

Yes, perhaps being located in an office building and having a slightly dated interior throws some people off, but I'm not one of those.

Great cold buffet to start....seafood, vegetables, Italian cold cuts, cheeses, ...I'd be happy just eating from this there are so many options.   As far as the meats, for me the highlights were the steaks. In the future I'd pass on the pork, turkey, and chicken. Probably the majority of the filet options as well. The one notable exception being the filet in mushroom wine sauce.   Lamb chops were also good.  But that flank steak? Whewwwww. Yeah, make sure you get some of that. The tenderloin, skirt, ribeye and other steaks cuts were all also very tasty. They were so much more flavorful than the filet I don't know why I would ever eat filet again.  Yes, it's pricey, but for an occasional indulgence or special occasion this place will definitely be in my future.   Enjoy.",

From all the varied and interesting selections in the salad bar, to the roaming meat servers. Grilled slab cut bacon, prime rib , beef and pork ribs, bacon wrapped filet,  rotisserie chicken, top sirloin, salmon (lots of salmon on salad bar too), beef tenderloin, etc.  We ran out of room before we could try everything. What a night! What a taste Fest!  Can't wait to return! (And I'm a picky bitch of an eater!!)",

Somewhat more low-key than the Churrascaria at Station Square with more seafood on the cold bar and at about the same price.   Allergy friendly with great service.",

    "text": "Green Forest is your traditional Churrascaria experience, on a smaller scale. The buffet offers a rotating variety of salads and cold dishes (a minor sushi offering, ussually just one or two simple rolls, crabs legs, shrimp cocktail, etc). Of course the real reason to go is the meat!   The selection varies slightly but has the usual mainstays, bacon wrapped turkey, flank or hanger Steak, (with or without garlic), lamb chops, leg of lamb, rib eye, skirt steak, top sirlon... These are brought to the table as long as you keep your placecard on the green side, often faster than I could keep up. (Not a complaint).   The waitstaff was attentive and knowledgeable. They responded well to special requests (we like our meat more on the rare side. They prepared a new top sirloin for us especially).   The only downside is that the deserts are nothing to write home about... then again, by the time desert comes around, at a place like this, who has room?",

    "text": "I took my boyfriend here for his birthday as he is a big fan of Brazilian steakhouses and all the meat!  We made reservations for a Friday night on open table but it seemed to get more crowded later in the evening-after 7:30.  The service could not have been better from being seated quickly to our waiter explaining everything (my first time at a Brazilian steakhouse) to the meat runners-loved their outfits.  The beer prices are very reasonable and I got a draft Blue Moon for only $3.50.  My date tried the Brazilian  beer Xingu which was very dark in color but tasted like a lager.  Up first was the cold buffet which had a lot of seafood from shrimp to sushi as well as many kinds of salad including cesar, potato and pasta. . I enjoyed the meats cheese and bread spread.  I opted not to get the meat or hot bar included and that option was $22.50-very pricey for a salad bar and for $20 more you get the hot buffet with potatoes, rice etc and unlimited meat. The amount and variety of meat options is pretty amazing from a chicken leg to prime rib.  The meat is served medium rare but they will happily cook the meat to how you like it. The place was clean and the food all seemed very fresh. I highly recommend for a special occasion.",

    "text": "My husband and I moved to Pittsburgh from Miami, FL a few months ago and I have really been missing latin influenced foods. Most of my review will focus on the latin aspect of this restaurant.   This is a very tradional type Churrascaria and reminded me of home. All of the meat was delicious and I definitely recommend going on a very empty stomach!  What I loved: White rice and beans - YUM!!! The beans were amazing, cooked with pork and so flavorful! Pan de Bono - Was part of the plate they placed on your table with various breads. This is basically a very fluffy roll with cheese cooked into the dough. Definitely the first place I have found in Pittsburgh that has it and it was amazing!! Fried yucca - Almost cried when I saw this sitting on our table! Yucca is a root vegetable, almost like a potato. Holy cow, first time I've had it since I moved here and it was cooked perfectly.  The service here was great. All the guys with the meat were friendly and came to the table one after another, so be sure to pace yourself!  The bill came to $102. We had: two prefix meals, one diet coke and one mojito. Pretty pricey, especially because I don't eat a lot, but it was right on par for the cost of any other Churrascaria I have been to!",

    "text": "I went to Green Forest for the first time in ten years. Amusingly, the last time I ate here was for High School Spanish Club. Grasp that concept. SPANISH club took us to a Brazilian (Portuguese-speaking) restaurant. Well done, Penn Hills.   At any rate, my latest visit was very pleasant. Sister and I went with a large group of people. We ordered drinks at the bar (which is a new addition to this restaurant). The  white sangria is some of the best I've ever had. Decent wine list, most of which are from South America. Don't try to order anything complicated, because the bartenders aren't that practiced yet, e.g. they had no idea what brandy was.   Now for the food. They have a prix fixe menu set (in 2012) at $42. This includes everything save dessert and drinks. Green Forest has a large cold bar with seafood, salad, vegetables, and cold cuts. A warning to those who do not like olives (like myself), they are mixed with many of the cold dishes (salad, potatoes, etc.). There is also a hot bar, which serves daily selections such as cooked rice and seasonal fish.  The Churrascaria (\"barbecue\" in Portuguese) dining experience is one everyone must try. At Green Forest, they give you a beer-mat type flipper. One side is red and the other is green.  When the green side is up, attentive waiters will flood to the tableside with many meat selections. My favorites were the filet mignon with parmesan and the leg of lamb. There are a little under twenty different selections of meats and all of them are very tasty.    A note; you CAN tell them how well-done you would like your selection. The waiter will simply give you a specific cut off the spit.   Once you are full, or simply want to take a break, flip over the bar mat to the red side and the steak parade will stop. As long as you want it to, that is!  Overall, staff is extremely friendly and attentive. Drinks and desserts are very expensive, so your bill can add up quickly if you don't stick to the prix fixe.",

The \"salad bar\" left something to be desired) but for a steakhouse, where the focus is on the steak, this place does it right. Meat coming from every direction it seemed at times. We counted 15 different types at 25+ instances of being offered (and our card was on red at times...) and 8 were phenomenal, 5 we'd definitely have again, and only 2 weren't to our liking. Take away - try EVERYTHING. Worth it :)",

If you've never been to a Churrascaria, it is a buffet where the \"meat runners\" come right to your table with meat on a skewer and slice off pieces right onto your plate. The steaks are so delicious you end up eating until you are about to burst. There are about 7 different types of steaks, and also chicken, turkey, sausage, lamb, etc. It is very expensive but worth going, especially if you can eat a lot. But any drinks, even a soda, cost extra. And dessert is extra as well, but I have never been able to eat dessert after all the steaks anyway! There is also a small regular buffet with some seafood and vegetables. But don't fill up on this, save room for all the meat! They don't open until 4pm.",
