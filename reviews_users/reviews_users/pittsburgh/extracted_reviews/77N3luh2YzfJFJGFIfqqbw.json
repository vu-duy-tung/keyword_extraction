    "text": "I went to Duke's Upper Deck Cafe recently and overall really enjoyed my visit.  I went there to watch an Elite 8 game, and felt a little out of place as I was the only person in the bar that didn't seem to know everyone who was there.  However, that quickly went away because the regulars and bar staff were extremely friendly and made the entire game more enjoyable (I was cheering for my alma-matter from outta state and they all encouraged me to enjoy the game and not worry about bothering them if I was loud).    The drinks were very fairly priced and feature a full bar and some great craft beer options. The food was just OK.  I ordered the wings, which were very good in a unique way.  The sauce is a mix of ranch and buffalo sauce and the wings come submerged in it. Initially this threw me for a loop but after trying them I can see why people love them, messy but delicious. I also ordered the pita pizza, i would not recommend this as it just wasn't very good.    I am looking forward to returning to Duke's this summer when I can sit outside and enjoy some craft beer and those delicious wings.",

Look for the bald guy with the raspy voice and make friends...he'll hook you up.  He's also totally into the development of other Pittsburgh businesses and he hosts events for local startups.  Ask him for a tour of the old Eat n Park next door...I believe his intention is still to turn it into an incubator of sorts.  Fortunately, the bar is close enough to the waterfront that it's just far enough out of the ghetto...the crowd is certainly decent.  Definitely have some beers on the porch in the summer...especially in the rain (lower level is covered).  Very relaxing atmosphere.  I wish my company was located in the area so we could frequent Dukes more steadily (we're on the north side).  Still worth the drive to feel at home, have a good bite and some cold beers.",

They have a great selection of beer but I think where they really shine is in the food department.    My favorite sandwich there is the Pinkerton and it's often hard to get anything else every time I go.  Pierogi Pizza is pretty good as well as there gigantic sampler platter that a party of 4 could eat together!  Dukes is also an awesome place to watch sporting events with their see it from any angle TV selections all around the bar.  Soups of the days are awesome (Potato soup yes please) and they have a excellent happy hour special that will save you a few dollars.    I've always been treated with a welcoming vibe from the staff and I don't have any complaints.",

My suggestion for those who are leery to try dukes after reading other ridiculous reviews is just order what they have on special that night... Everything is good so you can't go wrong and it will most likely come out faster and hotter being that it's on special.  If not I could suggest other delicious things to eat but I don't feel like typing out the entire menu... They often switch the beers out so there is always a constant flow of different and unique craft beers on tap... They can also print you out a list of beers and their percentage so you know what you are in for! (Lol) Anyhow I love this place, the owners, and the staff! I highly suggest it to everyone who likes good beer and good food!",

    "text": "I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH, a lot of locals were telling me that this was a good place to catch a game, drink some brews and get great food. Most of that is True, but the bad has mostly outweighed the good.  They have an excellent new tap system. Last time I went, they had Thirsty Dog Leghumpper on draft, and it was perfect. The system really elevates already awesome beer. Plus, the selection is awesome.   It is a sports-themed bar, so you can expect drunk locals, loud TV's and plenty of yelling. I'm sort of into that, so it doesn't bother me, although I do think their staff is not well equipped enough to work among the chaos. Service is often slow, and they give the waitresses ZERO training in the beers that they offer. This is not a good place for trying something new, as they can't tell you a thing about it.   The biggest downfall of Duke's, though, is the food. I've had three different, but equally simple, dishes there; A Burger, a Cheesesteak and Chicken Tenders. The first was flavorless and cold. The second was passable, but nothing special. And the last were absolutely awful. Honestly, the batter and size of the chicken made me so ill, I had to call it an early night. I ate two of the 7 tenders (SEVEN!) and had to quit.  Their fries are very good. And so are the wings.  I'd say Duke's is a good place to drink, but that's about it.",

The potato skins used a really cheap artificial cheese that was not very appealing.  I tasted a slice of pizza, which is definitely the best thing they offer.  The crust was delicious and homemade.  If you are going to order something, I would go with the pizza.  We also ordered the chicken wings which were pretty good, also.

The Tomlin Chicken sandwich served without modifications is a chicken sandwich with mushrooms, onions, sweet peppers, pepper jack cheese, lettuce, & tomato on a roll. Served with mild and wild wing sauces. Choice of fries or chips.   I requested that the onions & mushrooms be kept off of the sandwich. And that the wild wing sauce be held. Wild is too spicy for me these days. The sandwich comes with both mild and wild sauces. I also requested for Swiss cheese instead of pepper jack. And that the sandwich come with chips.  I asked for a side of honey mustard and ketchup.  Since I ordered from home and my husband brought it back, I didn't check the order before it left the restaurant.   What came home & I got was a chicken sandwich with Swiss cheese and red peppers. With French fries. And hot sauce and a mystery sauce. I'm not sure what the mystery sauce is. It's got a kick to it but kind of tastes like dressing. It's not honey mustard. The hot sauce isn't very tasty. I don't know what it is. But it's salty & bland. No ketchup.  However the chicken sandwich with just cheese and peppers is very tasty. So despite it not being what I had anticipated and previously ordered at the restaurant, it's really good so I'm still giving 4 stars.",

    "text": "Duke's is one of Homestead's best.  Located on 8th Avenue near the base of the Homestead Bridge, Dukes features an outdoor patio and  rooftop seating in addition to their indoor bar and dining area.   Duke's features about 50 excellent beers on tap ranging from local brews to West Coast favorites.    The menu should have something for everyone - burgers, pizza, sandwiches, delicious appetizers.  On my most recent visit, I dined here for lunch with my parents and my mom and I both gave into the \"favorite\" on the menu, \"The Pinkerton\".  This was a nice flip on the Philly Cheese steak.  Served on a delicious roll with shaved steak, peppers and mayo, you will not leave hungry.  My dad had the prime rib wrap and didn't leave a crumb on his plate.  The highlight of this visit was our waitress, Jamie.  The table next to us was throwing a hissy fit for almost no reason and then left without paying their bill.  Jamie handled it calmly with grace and then continued to serve our table with a smile and a good sense of humor.  In fact, the entire staff at Dukes is great.  The chef came out to try and deal with the unruly folks and he never broke a sweat and didn't let them get under his skin.  Very impressive and makes me want to come back again, soon!",

    "text": "2 strikes. Enjoy the fact that there are other options in the area like Dukes but our last couple visits have been very disappointing.   Hate to do it but I need to leave a review in hopes the manager can get things right. One of the main issues is that the kitchen is overcooking the hell out of the food I've ordered the past 2 visits.   I can deal with a long wait which is understandable when there is a game on but having to wait for something that comes out missing something and overcooked can be frustrating especially given the cost.   Last visit was a burger. I gave up and refused the offer for another. Bartenders were super cool about it and even offered me free drink tokens which I decided to redeem today.   I felt bad just ordering free beer so I ordered a sandwich. It was the roast beef and turkey club which was described specifically on the menu as medium rare which sounded pretty good to me. The roast beef was beyond that. I would say extra well done. Obviously one of the chefs is struggling but I'm not totally sure that the beef was cooked in house. I'm not a chef but know when to pull a roast beef out of the cooker to achieve the proper temp. Anyway I decided not to say anything since the sandwich was still pretty edible and because of my girlfriend being embarrassed of me complaining.   Decent beer selection. Waitress was very pleasant and attentive. Bar staff not so much this visit. We were ignored until I grabbed a table in the back. Neither of us weren't very happy about this. Possibly a no standing policy since there was only one empty chair at the bar? At least say something/acknowledge the customer that has been standing clearly in your view for 10 min obviously waiting for a drink.",

    "text": "Solid Pittsburgh Bar/Eatery.   Brendan and I have lived near Homestead for going on 3 years and only visited Duke's for the first time this past week. Sacrilegious, I know! First of all, I love the lay out of it. There's a shuffle board in the space between Eighth & Hays and Duke's and you can sit there as well. There are windows, but it's completely covered, making it the perfect spot to hang when it's raining. The upper deck is awesome, of course- who doesn't love a good spot to sit outdoors? Although we could have had dinner near the bar, it was really loud there, so we were thankful there was some additional seating in the back of the restaurant. It was quiet and more spacious there, which was nice. I wasn't too hungry, so I only had french onion soup and a side salad to eat. Brendan ordered a burger and fries and his mom ordered the potato skin appetizer. Everyone liked their food. The burger was pretty big and Brendan really enjoyed it. The fries were not fresh cut, but they were still very good. What I was the most impressed with was their beer selection. They had so many great beers on tap. I chose a wheat beer from Gristhouse and was not disappointed. Overall, we had a great time and look forward to returning!",

There was a lengthy beer list and lots of seating spread throughout the inside and outside of the building.

I was going to get a burger until I saw on the back of the menu that they do prime rib on Saturday evenings. For $19 you got a large cut of meat, which was pretty tasty, a large side salad, and I chose a loaded baked potato for the side. They were a little chintzy with the sides. The prime rib came with no horseradish sauce or au jus. I asked for a horseradish sauce, which they had, but the container was so small I had to ask for another. It was a similar situation with the large side salad. It was pretty big, and required at least a second side of dressing. The food was all pretty good, with the prime rib taking the lead and the baked potato bringing up the rear. As always, the beer selection was pretty solid and I really enjoyed my East End Brewery Monkey Boy.",

The flavor is packed and the quality of how it is cooked and was presented to me was stellar! I also ordered the mozzarella cheese sticks and they were more like logs! This is worth it if you are truly a foodie and fan of the cheese sticks.   For my main course, I ordered two things as I wanted to try both! The first thing I ordered was a turkey burger. It was not as appealing as the written description but it was edible. Next, I ordered the jerk chicken salad and I was impressed. The salad was fresh and yummy. The chicken was tasty as it was a jerk seasoned blackened piece of chicken. So it is very safe for people who are not wanting the spice as it is not spicy.   The long islands were delicious and for the price of ten bucks a mug- I was really happy enjoying all I had to eat!",

    "text": "Duke's has good food and good beer, making it a solid choice in my book. I was happy to find somewhere so close to home with such a big menu for days when I need a restaurant that my whole family can enjoy; Duke's had chicken entrees, salads, burgers, sandwiches, and lots of snack options that satisfied everyone in my party.  I ordered the chicken salad and loved how crisp and delicious the fries were, and the seasoning on the chicken was delicious. On an earlier visit, I ordered wings, which were also good.  We dined in around 9pm on a Friday and were able to snag a table in the quieter back room without any wait. Our waitress was friendly and personable, and made our table feel well cared-for. Food came out quickly, and everyone in my party gave their dishes positive reviews.",

They had a huge list of draft beers but it was super hard to read them on the tiny register paper they give you to read (might just be me). They did have an awesome Arsenal Amber Cider!!! Delish. I think it was $8 in a short mixed drink glass but that's a sipping drink - high alcohol context.  The indoor patio area had seating but it was easy to see why no one was in there.  It had a slight musty odor.  Probably will be better once their able to open it up.",

    "text": "I had no idea this place existed and I've been going to the Waterfront since High School. I went on a work outing with my colleagues so that's how I found out about Duke's.   Their beer list is truly extensive and for a group that loves beer, it definitely hit the spot for us. There was something for everyone. I had a Titos and soda, they did not underwhelm in the alcohol department :). During lunch in the middle of the week makes it easy for a bigger group to come there but I imagine it gets more filled up as the night goes on.   Their food was great! I ordered the French onion soup, which is my absolute favorite soup to be had and it was just right. Not too salty or overdone and loads of cheese which made it even better. I also ordered a Cajun chicken salad. I ordered the fries on the side, however. There could've been more lettuce in the salad but it all tasted great. Lots of chicken and good spice. The fries were super crispy and delicious. The only two negatives I found weren't with me but my co-workers. One ordered a burger and she said it was not seasoned enough but everyone has different pallets when it comes to seasoning. And my other co-worker ordered steamed veggies as his side and it was A LOT of undercooked red onions, mushrooms and some zucchini. It was just a very weird plate but I ended up putting them on my salad because I love warm veggies on a cold salad.   If you're looking for a decent place for lunch that's inexpensive, then definitely try here!",

    "text": "Today we went to one of our favorite watering holes, Dukes Upper Deck in Homestead. During nice weather you can sit out on a top deck and enjoy the sunshine or starry night. There is even a covered outside eating area.  The place fills up quickly on a Friday night. We have had to leave on a couple occasions due to lack of seating. :(  They have 48 beers on tap! A Nitrous system. For a beer lover, you can taste different brews at a fair price. They also have a happy hour that makes that special brew selection even better!  The food is wonderful. They do something with their fries that make them crunchie on the outside, but soft inside. They are very addictive. When you get to the bottom of the plate you wish you had more.  Their sandwiches are truly delicious! Their hamburgers are not premade boxed kind. The Reuben is full of corned beef and sauerkraut. The portions are hungry man size. The Pinkerton.... oh my! 2 can enjoy one sandwich, or take home half for lunch the next day. The works burger....even bigger and full of fixins! The prices are great for an enjoyable meal. There are many different choices on the menu to choose from.  The bartender is so very nice. The waitresses friendly and helpful.  Try it! You won't be dissappointed.",

There is a small off street parking lot and then the normal street parking. We went on a Sunday which we never do and the service was disappointing, granted everyone was very friendly however they were out of a few beer selections I wanted to order and then they were out of provolone sticks....really how can you be out of those! Haha. There is no manager on duty that day either which is very odd being that it is a restaurant.... will come back, sadly just not on a Sunday.",

Draft list was excellent- so many unique beers on tap that I had never tried before! Settled on a Mexican hot chocolate stout that was delicious.  Menu was very meat heavy so as a vegetarian, I was pretty limited. Everyone at my table loved the French onion soup. I got the deluxe veggie riverboat, which was a solid sandwich. The side salad was definitely a lot larger than a normal side salad and pretty fresh. My partner got the Reuben which looked good, and definitely stole a lot of his onion rings.  Nice place for a quick bite in homestead! Our service was just attentive enough, and no one minded that we hung around a while after we finished.",

The servers are all very friendly and gave me suggestions on what to get since it was my first time eating there. The list of draft beers is huge! The Hand of the Queen barleywine was a nice choice. The food was good, nothing super special or extravagant, but still good. I had a meatball riverboat. If you've ever had the meatball tostini sub at Primanti Bro, the meatball riverboat tastes exactly the same. I would definitely make this a go-to for some late night grub again.",

    "text": "Overall Duke's Upper Deck was a nice atmosphere and seemed like an after work hang out for the locals of all ages mid 20s and up.  PARKING - Duke's has a small parking lot for maybe 15ish cars but since it was full, we had to find parking on the very steep hill with limited spaces available. Heels and hills are still not a favorite combination of mine. I am still not sure about parking rules in PA since I'm from TX but we didn't get towed so I guess that's good.    BEER - My husband raved about the beer selection and he wasn't off. This place has one of the largest draft beer selections of all the places I've been to so far. The happy hour prices can't be beat either!  FOOD - The hubby and I shared onion rings which were pretty good. I like to think I am not a picky person but my French Dip was not a favorite. The meat was overcooked, bland, and dry. The as jus sauce was decent but could not make up for the thing that was missing. I would have to add horseradish or something if I every ordered it again. The fries were amazing! I ate half my husbands plate ]:). My husband had the bleu burger which came out Well done even though he ordered medium but overall he was satisfied with his meal.    SERVICE - We sat at the downstairs bar area and although it was busy, it was not chaotic enough receive the lackluster service that we did. It seems like the wait staff was working 3-4 tables in our area and some tables on the upper deck of the interior building. Our waters ran out multiple times, my husband was able to finish a beer long before another one was ordered, and we maybe saw her about 2 or 3 times during the whole meal. I can't give the place more stars because of the service experience but I would go back on a slower night or during weekend lunch to give it another chance.",
