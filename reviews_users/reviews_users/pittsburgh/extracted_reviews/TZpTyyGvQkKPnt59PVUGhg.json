    "text": "Amazing Food - local, fresh, delicious. Definitely try the burgers, pierogi, bluefish pate, and any dessert. You can also order from the Legume menu in the bar if the Legume kitchen is open. The people are amazing - service is totally down to earth and not uppity at all. It can sometimes be tricky to get a seat, since there are no reservations - just first come, first served - but it's so worth it! If you haven't been yet - GO NOW! They open at 4 pm so it's great for happy hours that transition into dinners. Will is an AMAZING bar manager, and will always make you something you enjoy even if it's not on the menu - although the menu options are always superb. If you haven't been back in awhile, get back there now!",

They sell out like crazy and we were lucky to get the last piece. I've read positive reviews so the expectation's already there but when I tasted it. I knew all the raving about that burger is True. Other items on the menu were ok but next time I would just get the burger and skip those.",

The place was packed wall to wall. It was good to see people getting out to enjoy some great food and support their communities. The servers donated all of their cash tips to a designated non-profit in the area. Amizade was the non-profit selection last night. Amizade helps connect people throughout the world with community projects to enhance education, health, fair trade, and other services. Overall if you enjoy a fine craft beer selection with a menu infused with fresh options daily, then Butterjoint is a great spot to try.",

    "text": "It is sad for me to give Butterjoint only three stars because just two months ago this would have been a five star review. Unfortunately, the hamburgers are no longer living up to the standards that originally were established. Butterjoint had been our \"go to\" place for burgers - delicious food, easy access and consistent. No more. The past three times have not been good and each time for the exact same reasons. The \"extra fancy\" burger is meant to come with bacon. Last night, two of the four had no bacon and two had just one piece of bacon. The toppings used to consist of (for example) fried or sauteed onion rings or kimchi, always paired with cheese and a variety of other distinctive options. Now, all we get are a few semi-pickled cucumbers with uninspired cheese. And the fries that were always crispy, abundant and very easy to share have been under cooked and very stingy. The meat is still good, but for the price - and even for less - there are much better burgers within walking distance. Our inference is that there is an effort being made to cut costs - if so, it really shows and has turned us off completely. If not, then this calls for new kitchen help to assure consistency of quality and variety in the burger toppings offered on the daily special.",

There's a good selection of drafts not to scoffed at thanks to their generous happy hour pricing. The small plates all looked pretty good, the swiss raclette with gherkins I got was awesome and exactly what I wanted.   I need to try a burger next time because the one that went by me looked like a perfect late night snack during their late night happy hour.  Glad this place exists.",

The ambiance is really nice. Laid back but refined, not quiet but not loud. Our server was genuine and hilarious, plus he had great recommendations. The cocktail menu is mostly classic cocktails, but I ended up going with a concoction of rum, applejack, and spices that was wintery deliciousness. My friend said all of the (many) classic cocktails he got were perfect.  For food we had the daikon fries, salad du jour, pickle platter, and burgers. Everything was really good, but the standout was the AMAZING pickles! The burger was cooked rare as requested and the meat was definitely top notch, but it was a little too salty for me, and I wasn't a huge fan of the accompanying fries with a pretty bland aioli. One of my friends did the one-plate supper of the night, which was stroganoff with meatballs--and the meatballs were seriously to die for. Who says that about meatballs?  Butterjoint made me want to kick myself for not getting to Legume sooner, so I'll definitely have to sample the full menu next time!",

They have a great cocktail culture that stems from having two amazing bartenders behind the bar. The vibe of the restaurant was a mix of younger trendy professionals and students. The food, drinks and vibe were amazing but what really stood out for me was the excellent service! I ordered a bourbon drink knowing I don't like bourbon (wanted to try something new) and they took it off my bill even though it was completely my fault and I was willing to pay for it. They also were kind enough to help us find our way home since we were visiting from Canada and didn't have access to internet. Highly recommend this place!",

My drinking companion and I were able to get seated without a problem, which is nice because it usually seems to be packed.  We didn't order any food, since he just came from dinner elsewhere, and I'd had dinner earlier.  I ordered the house white blend, and it was \"citrusy and refreshing,\" as our waiter put it.  My drinking companion ordered a cocktail with tequila, fortified wine, and orange bitters, which I took a sip of, and it was quite refreshing, as well.  Service was excellent, as I've come to expect in establishments such as Legume, and our server was great at explaining the various drinks and suggesting them based on our tastes.  The atmosphere was laid back and classy, and quiet enough to actually converse with my drinking companion--much better than the average Oakland bar.  The only downside is that the drinks are a bit pricy, but the happy hour discount helps, and hey, you're paying for quality.  To be honest, I don't feel that I can fairly rate this place until I order some of the cocktails or food, hence why I'm going with my default \"I liked it\" 4-star rating.  I'm sure I'll be back, though, given how close I live!",

If you don't get there before 5, you'll be standing.  The decor gives off a speak-easy vibe, and the bartenders and wait staff match, with hipster staches and clothes.  Parking can be a pain, but is free on the street after 6.  If you work in Oakland and plan to head to Butterjoint, I advise leaving your car where it's at and walk.  The full Legume menu is available at Butterjoint.  I've never ordered food here, as I prefer to concentrate on beer.  My friends and coworkers have raved about the food, though, esp the burger.

I'm so glad that we did!! It is a small space on the opposite side of Legume with a separate entrance. There are a few tables in the front and back and bar seating. It was pretty busy when we were there but we were able to get a high table at the front.   We ordered a few different cocktails from the somewhat limited menu. The Black Manhattan was delicious, even though it was on the rocks and I usually order my Manhattans straight up. I also tried my boyfriend's Sazerac, which was also very good. The bartenders here know what they are doing! Bar Marco is still my bar of choice, but this one is up there with the recent openings of great cocktail bars in the city. There is a small selection of snacks, appetizers, and burgers as well. The service was attentive without being pushy, and we were left to enjoy our drinks with ample time between orders.  The background music and general noise level never overpowered our conversation, so it is a great bar to enjoy a few drinks with friends. Also, the lack of televisions is wonderful and adds to the relaxed vibe as it encourages patrons to focus on each other and their delicious drinks. I will definitely come back the next time I am in Oakland!",

If you can't offer fried chicken livers and then make it delicious, something is wrong. Unseasoned, greasy, poor fry. Blue fish crostini were ok, but the toasted baguette slices with olive oil had no finesse. Cold, crumbly. Cocktail was bourbon, rum, aperol and bitters I think. Good, but a little unbalanced with too much orange and not enough bourbon kick. Atmosphere was nice, busy and warm. Too bad about the iffy cooking.",

    "text": "Butterjoint has the space and atmosphere of a dive.  Which is great, right?  Well, in a word, no.  Butterjoint is not the dive that you love but rather the dive that you never want to go back to.  It has a reputation for making good cocktails, or so I've been told, and I can only imagine that reputation is used to mask a food menu that is uninspired in both design and execution.  I have eaten here twice, once with friends and the other time with my girlfriend.  I would not recommend this place to anyone.  Ambiance: See above, I know of hole-in-the-walls just south of Washington Square Park in New York that have more ambiance in the limited curb appeal than this cramped and hot space.  Service: The service was fantastic the first time I went but I accredit this to the fact that my friends knew the people that worked here.  The second time, without that built-in relationship and rapport, my girlfriend and I were consistently ignored throughout the entire meal.  We were not greeted at the door.  We were not shown to a table.  It took ten minutes before anyone noticed that no server was taking our table, during which time our soon-to-be waitress gave a great big bear hug to, wait for it, someone that she knew.  No silverware was given with our meal.  The list goes on.  The bottom line is that quality of service is not measured by how you treat the regulars but how you perform on a consistent basis with any random customer.  Butterjoint would do well to learn and observe this maxim.  Food: I've eaten better burgers at the chain restaurant Five Guys.  The perogies might as well have been Mrs. Ts from the freezer.  And the fries, I don't know how they tasted because they were cold and not worth even trying.  Burgers are an everyman type of food that is genuinely hard to make bad.  Butterjoint is impressive in that respect since it managed to do that very thing.  Price: Unreasonable cost for a burger that tastes like this.  I'd rather go to Five Guys to save money and have a much better burger.  The reputation for good cocktails: I can't speak on it since I ordered a beer; not a cocktail.  Given the aforementioned comments, I have to believe there are other trendy spots in Pittsburgh to quench my alcoholic thirst than this place.    In summary, if you're hungry look elsewhere.  If you have a craving for a cocktail, I'm sure you can find a place that combines an inviting and comfortable ambiance with tasty concoctions.",

We were in town for a few days and I was craving a good burger something awful so what do I do? I pull up my trusty Yelp app. My hubby makes fun of me for my dependence on Yelp, but he was thanking me yesterday.   The menu is very small, mostly consisting of burgers and pierogi. I ordered the burger with Gruyere and caramelized onions and my hubby got the same. First, I tried the fries, which I had with the aioli. How awesome. They were flavorful and fresh and everything that tries should be. Impressed and hopeful, I moved on to the burger. Holy Burgervana, Batman! That burger was good! The patty was clearly freshly ground on-site, the meat-fat ratio was perfect! And the flavor...oh, the flavor! It was well-seasoned, but not overly so as to take away from the flavor of the beef itself.   While eating a good meal, I hum. When eating a really good meal, I tend to rock from side to side. I did both last night.",

Anyways, the server with the long hair was quite rude with the way he responded when we were trying to get a plate. He said with a long and demeaning tone \"what do you want?\" Seriously?  Ugh, I told you I was splitting a dish, you could at least bring an extra plate if you aren't going to cut my burger in half like you usually do.

What made it even better is the waiter took our drink order while we waited, and then served us where we stood.  This was great for two reasons, first, the bar was crowded and it was tough to get any room, and the second was it was already on our bill when we sat down and didn't have to worry about closing any tabs.  Overall I thought the level of service was excellent considering it was crowded.    I had a burger, and in my mind it was the best burger in town.  I had it with the cave aged Gruyere and some lettuce and tomato.  Man it was so good.  My wife went with a couple small plates, the beef tartare and the pate, she raved over both of them.  However, I will never ever order anything but the burgers here.  It looked like they made their mayo in house, I didn't put it on my burger, but did dip my fries in it.  Was a little over garlic'ed for my taste, so beware there, I was happy I didn't put it on my burger.    Overall, great cocktails, amazing burger, great service.  Definitely coming back.",

Don't let anyone tell you otherwise. And if they do they're wrong. They have a pastry chef make the brioche buns. The meat is perfectly cooked and seasoned. The aioli is absurd. The toppings are fresh. The bacon is wonderfully complementary. I wish they'd let me order a sunny side up egg on top of the burger, but that's me picking nits. It's a small dining area, but it doesn't matter. If you want the best burger experience in Pittsburgh, this is where you go. You could get lesser burgers elsewhere for less money, and in fact, I'd prefer you did. More for me.",

We opened the place at 4:30, securing a coveted seat at the bar and were promptly welcomed and watered by a bartender. Happy Hour prices are a steal - $5 wines, house, but pretty good by house wine standards. Our group sampled a few of the small plates which left us all wanting more.  On the burger, \"The burger was like meat-butter. Caramelized onions paired with gruyere melted to make a French onion soup kinda-burger, which was melt in your mouth good.\"    On the pierogis, \"A comforting mix of cheese and potato fluff. Filling and delicious with greens, onions and kielbasa creating a salty crunch.\"  On the tartare, \"A dippy egg laden masterpiece - the perfect combination of salty and savory.\"  Learned that several of my favorite menu items are seasonal, making Butterjoint a regular on my 'must-visit' list.",

Their beer selection, while a tad small, is quite mighty.  They have a wide array of cocktails and spirits to choose from.  If you can swing it, try to go during happy hour when they have $4 craft beers and $7 cocktail of the day (I know some wines are on sale, too, but I'm not a wine drinker, so I didn't pay that close attention as to what their HH pricing was).   In addition to drinks, they have some of the tastiest burgers in the city.  You really don't need anything crazy on these burgers--just some cheese and light toppings--they are so juicy and delicious all on their own!   My only qualm is that I wish it were a tad larger--that way more people could enjoy this location at a time.  The small, quaint, atmosphere is delightful, though.   If you find yourself reading this review prior to your arrival, check the NO WAIT app and \"get in line\" for a table.  You can drastically reduce your at-the-restaurant wait times with this app.",

I could start a whole Schweaty Balls type commentary on them, they were that good.  It's no surprise, considering Butterjoint is connected with Legume, the equally as amazing restaurant next door. The bar is pretty much the same as it was before. Still dark, romantic and cozy, but with an expanded drink and appetizer menu. Brilliant move on their part because they'll attract people to the bar casually, then suck them in for the promise of delicious food next door!  For my drink I went with my old favorite, the Papa Dobe, which had Mt. Gay Eclipse Rum, Maraschino Liqueur, grapefruit and lime. I just can't get away from a drink with grapefruit. It's so refreshing, and this certainly did the trick. I also enjoy these well made cocktails because, although it's quite small, it's strong and meant to be sipped. Rather than a mixed drink thrown together at an average run of the mill bar that you suck down in five seconds because there's no liquor in it. No thanks.  We also ordered up the pierogie appetizer. Also, accompanied by homemade sauerkraut, which is the perfect blend of sweet and sour. The pierogies are made in house as well, and were crispy, but not burnt, filled with a potato and cheese blend that combined the best of two fine ingredients.  See, they hook you in. Because it made me think... \"Rachel, you must head back to Legume, stat!\" It did the trick simple as that, all it took were some tasty balls!",

    "text": "Very disappointed. I went expecting a great bar food experience on a high end scale. The prices were higher but I figured it must be worth it. I got the \"fancy burger\" but was surprised with the low quality. Sure, the beef was grass fed and local but it didn't stand a quality check. The bun was charred and ruined the taste of the entire burger. The single beer battered onion ring only covered the outer ring of the burger and the cheese clumped off with every bite. I asked for medium well and received welllll done. I've had better $9 burgers at cheap bars with more flavor than the one here. Just because they stamp \"fancy\" on the bun doesn't make it fancy. Ended up spending $46 for two mediocre hamburgers, a beer, and $6 tip. Insane! However, despite the disappointment with the fancy burger and poor patty mixture, the fries were crispy. *yay* They did not have a light lager menu but their bar seemed to be upscale. The service was great as well. They truly did do a great job waiting on us. However, that doesn't really make up for the meal and it'd have to be a place you become accustomed to i suppose.",

Since it's connected to a nice restaurant (Legume), it has a little bit more of an upscale feel, but it's still relaxed (and it's always pretty loud). Get there early if you want a seat during the weekend or other popular times- it's small and fills up fast. This time, I got the hearty salad, which was great (though a little small for $14) and the fries. They change their menu up pretty regularly but I've been back a bunch of times and everything I've gotten has been great!",

    "text": "SETTING: Connected to Legume, a small and cozy bar with table seating for small parties (2-4 people). Casual atmosphere, no frills.   FOOD: Burgers. That is all.   I've been to Burgatory a good amount of times, and yes, I like their burgers. BUT Butterjoint's burgers are a notch above in quality. Medium rare and juicy goodness with every bite. Oh. My. Goodness. And this is just the regular burgers. They have burgers of the day too. Comes with crispy fries on the side. I want to say these are some of the best quality burgers I've had.  SERVICE: Waiting staff is average. I think they may have only 1-2 waiters at a time, and sometimes when things get busy, it may take a while for get noticed. They are polite, however, and try to help when they can--they are just busy. This really isn't a restaurant type of setting and more of a bar with seating around it, so I suppose the wait staff reflects that atmosphere.  IMPRESSIONS: Definitely my go to spot when I need a good burger close by to where I live. Pricing is very reasonable and comparable to other burger joints like Burgatory, My advice is to go on off times for a casual early dinner (4pm) or later dinner (9pm) bite since seating is pretty limited. Let me know when you ever have a tough week, I'll meet you here for burgers and drinks. It's the perfect pick me up!",

    "text": "My friend and fellow Yelper Carly K and I are always looking for fun places to grab appetizers and drinks and selected Butterjoint as our destination this week! I was a little confused as I walked into the restaurant when no one greeted me and was taken aback when another party barged in ahead of me, taking a table. Thankfully, there was still one table left after they were seated, so in my confusion of how seating worked (well, I'm still confused actually), my friend and I didn't get stuck fighting for seats at the bar.  As we arrived toward the end of happy hour, we started with a carafe of the house white. I was delightfully surprised by the wine. My reaction to most white wines is *meh* but this Portuguese white was absolutely delicious. I was excited when the carafe also gave us each two full glasses. We shared the tallow fries, which were flavorful and crispy, and then I tried the pierogies with sauerkraut on the side. Though the sauerkraut seemed a bit tough (undercooked?), the pierogies were perfectly warm, golden, and fried.  Even though we went to Butterjoint on the Monday night of Christmas week, the bar area was absolutely packed by 7pm, and the restaurant felt a bit claustrophobic due to the warm temperature. Though I really enjoyed the food, I wouldn't have enjoyed staying in the hectic environment much longer!",

Came here for a friend's birthday last month and I was highly impressed. The whole evening prior to our visit my group was raving about the burgers here and I couldn't imagine that they would be as life changing they made them out to be, but said nothing to deter the groups enthusiasm. On perhaps the biggest restaurant whim in my life, I went along with the group and decided to order one just so I could see what all the fuss was about. I got the fancy burger du jour (grilled ramps and ramp aioli) done medium.  IT WAS THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER CONSUMED. EVER.  (My other top two faves came from Wingharts in Market Square and BRGR in East Liberty).  So juicy, so moist, so delicious. Perfectly cooked. The meat pretty much melts as you bite into it; it was like a symphony of flavors in my mouth.  I would highly recommed trying it out to anyone who is a burger nut.   Oh, and the cocktails were delish too.",

That ended up being ok, because our experience there was pretty good.   When we arrived there was a wait, but they have a tasteful beer selection and it was still happy hour. Eric was our server; he was very professional and friendly. No issues with the service at all!   For an appetizer we ordered the pickled radishes. We wanted something that wouldn't fill us up too much before dinner. This was a very simple appetizer with some amazing, bold flavors. The radishes were lacto-fermented and served with a perfectly contrasting creamy chili mayo.   We ordered the pierogies which were served with caramelized onions, sauerkraut (our choice), and sour cream. A good chunk of the menu is taken up by pierogi options which was surprising to me at the time, but then I finally put it together given the strong Polish roots in Pittsburgh. These pierogies had a nice chew to them and all the components worked nicely together. Would I order it again though? No. I was curious to see if there was something I was missing out on. Don't get me wrong, who wouldn't like potato and cheese stuffed dough? I just have a feeling there were stronger, more interesting menu items that should have been had.   The other item we ordered was the hamburger with Goot Essa cheddar. This was prepared well-- and you can tell that it is ground in house. Really good flavor.   I'm giving Butterjoint 4/5 stars, but I have a feeling if I chose more adventurous menu items it could have easily been 5 stars. As far as food that I had on my recent trip in Pittsburgh, it definitely was at the top and if in town again I would definitely go back. Little side notes: atmosphere was hip and who ever was playing the music was playing some excellent tunes.",

The bread is grilled just enough, and the patty is deliciously juicy (along with the cheese on top). In addition, the thin fries go super well with the burger. Definitely worthwhile.",

We didn't have plans one night so figured we would go check out Butterjoint and see what it's all about.  Well, it's all about the yummy in my opinion!   Upon entering, we were told seating was first come, first served so we grabbed a two top by the windows.  Within seconds, we were greeted by a friendly server who took our drink order... And came back with drinks quickly.  I was on fence as to what I wanted to order and he informed us that we could also order from the Legume menu. I wanted to see it, and he got us one super quickly.  My husband ordered from the Butterjoint menu - the corn fritter soup and the fancy burger... Both were fabulous. I love the tallow fries that come with the burger. Yum!  I ordered the mixed greens salad and beef tenderloin.  It was perfectly medium like I wanted and it melted in my mouth, like butter.  So good. I have to have it again.  For dessert, we had the inauthentic pavlova (I think that was the name)... Authentic or inauthentic, it was amazing.   The service was awesome, the food was fabulous, and the environment was chill. I highly recommend it... You won't be disappointed :)",

    "text": "I found this place on yelp looking for good restaurants in the area.  It looked interesting, as the images showed that they carved the word \"fancy\" into their burgers.  So I checked it out.  The restaurant  was small, with a bar and only a few tables, and the menu was equally small.  But each item was unique.  The bartender, Austin, had a great personality and started plenty of topics for conversation.  I had an order of pierogies and an extra fancy burger that came with a side of fries.  The pierogies were some of the best I had ever had. They were thick, packed with potatoes, and had a generous portion of caramelized onions on top.  The fries were small, but fried to perfection, and they came with an aioli to dip in.  Finally, there was the extra fancy burger.  It was grilled to a perfect medium well.  It had a smooth and creamy buttercup cheese.  It had delicious sauteed mushrooms and onions.  The bacon was perfect.  And the aioli was amazing, capping off what was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had.  All in all, Butterjoint was a fantastic dining experience, and one that you should define fly check out if you are in Oakland, PA.",

Although neighborhood felt a little dead when we came here late on a Thursday night, we were pleasantly happy to be embraced by the ambiance and a kitchen that was open late.   Everything on the menu looked delicious, but everyone told me that I could not go wrong with the burgers here, so I obliged and did not regret it one bit! The burgers are juicy, flavorful with a nice bun to meat ratio. I know that sounds a little particular, but I know you know what I'm talking about.  And how about those pirogies?  Excellent as well. I was surprised by the generous portions and just how filling it was, complimented by the kielbasa. Just about everything you could ever want from a late night, quality bite!   Also, they had great deals on house wines. How can you really go wrong?  The answer: You can't.",

They only have around 7 tables total and a lot of first come/first serve bar and window counter space.   We got in at 6:30 pm on a Monday night and they weren't too busy.   It could actually be twice the size and still fill every table.   I had the Extra Fancy burger of the day with bacon and fries.  It was excellent.  Once of the best burgers that I have had. However the fries were almost cold.  I told the waitress when she came back to check on us and she simply offered to let the kitchen know for future customers.  She offered nothing to make it right.  I was a little shocked.  I would have taken another order of hot fries. Especially since the burger was $17.   My friend got the tartare.  He said it was very good, but it was the first time he had had it, so he had nothing to compare it to.  I don't like tartare, so I didn't try it.    Overall, it was very good. I would definitely come back.  I really wanted to give it 5 stars, but the whole french fry thing kind of ticked me off. The waitress was very attentive and nice otherwise.  I guess they don't care if you don't like the quality of any of their food product.  They have so many people who will fill the seats, they don't care about how hot the fries are or if you care or not.",

Why in the world would you ask someone what they wanted before they had a menu.  She was fully aware that I couldn't have seen a menu yet as she mentioned that they change daily and had yet to be printed.    The goat merguez that I settled on was delicious.  The pierogis were quite good but the potato filling could have been slightly smoother.  In fairness, they were competing against my grandmother.  The server was inattentive, cavalier, and as such, inhospitable.  Here's hoping this is a temporary job for her.  The hospitality industry is not where she can excel.

The hearty salads are also delicious and very filling. The atmosphere is cozy - you just feel \"at home\" here.

    "text": "This has been on my list to try ever since I visited Legume last year. Many friends have also said Butterjoint has their favorite burger. Finally got a chance to visit and it did not disappoint.   Butterjoint is mostly a bar with a few larger tables and a rather small food menu. I would say burgers and pierogis are the stars of the food menu (which I ordered both), although there are some small plates and desserts too. We got the hamburger with cheddar cheese and caramelized onions and the pierogis with kielbasa and sauteed greens. The burger was good, but the caramelized onions made it better and the fries were the bomb. Could've used more fries! The pierogis were perfectly cheesy and doughy, with the perfect level of crispness on the outside. Again, the caramelized onions made it better. Sauteed greens were just kale and they were a hair too salty for me, still tasty though. The kielbasa was a nice touch and you could taste the quality meat. I also ordered the pickle back shot (as recommended by a friend who regulars here). Now, I've never had a pickle back shot and neither do I know if most bars will serve it, but Butterjoint has it for $5. It's just a shot of whiskey and then a shot of pickle juice. If you like pickles (and whiskey, separately), the shot is delicious.   Overall, the food was pretty good and the service was excellent. The space is small, though. We lucked out and came across only two empty seats at the bar.   Quick note: I overheard one of the employees talking to some other patrons that they plan on opening another restaurant across the street? If this is True, I'm excited to see what else they come up with!",

It's small and cozy, so luckily we got there before the majority of people and had a great spot at the bar.   Happy hour specials included $4 drafts (which was what I had) and specials on wine and one liquor drink. Bonus points for the fact that they had several local brews on tap! I enjoyed a Grist House summer saison. The bartender was very friendly and gave great service.  I've also heard they do a beautiful job with their happy hour fundraisers - awesome to see them supporting great local nonprofit agencies!

The site clearly states first come first serve or use Nowait but doesn't specify they can't accommodate a reservation for more than 4 on there.   Here on a Tuesday currently and I've been waiting for 45 minutes for only 3. Silly wait times but the drinks are crafted well. Will update on food.  Still waiting at 50 minutes. They took two groups before us that were checked in well after us.  So food was ok. Bland burger. Really nothing to write home about. I expected more from a place like this and a burger priced at $20. Basic beef burger with blue cheese, pickles and bacon. The burger was cooked rare like I like it but the outside didn't have a good sear so it was really mushy.  Want a good burger? Hit up SMOKE in Lawrenceville on Tuesday's!!!!! Nice sear on the outside and soft middle!",

Was unaware you can order anything off of Legume's menu (sister restaurant attached to the left of Butterjoint) until our bartender handed us both menus. Startedwith the pierogies. They serve you four topped with caramelized onions and sour cream. Pierogies are made in-house and you can really tell. The dough was thick and the filling was rich and creamy with lumps of potatoes. They were mouthwatering! Excited to try them next time with an added side. My friend built his own *grass-fed* burger and he too was blown away. Said it's the best burger he's had in Pittsburgh to date. Served with delicious French fries. I ordered the Grilled Escarole salad off of Legume's menu. It was on the smaller side but the flavor was remarkable, with house made croutons, pickled turnips, shaved parmesan, hold the bacon. So delicious, very excited to try more menu items in the future. The draft beer list was also seamless. So many options from local craft breweries including Full Pint, Spoonwood, Grist House, Draai Laag, Arsenal, etc. We were seated at the bar and admired the bar tenders brewing up some elaborate cocktails as well.   Restaurant is pretty small. When you walk through the doors the bar is adjacent to the left wall, with just a few tables around the perimeter. Ambience is really cozy, somewhat romantic. Cannot wait to get back and try some more items.",

My fries were ordered well done, they were not when they came. They only gave us about 10 fries on each plate, very stingy. The person I came with had requested NO onions with the burger, the burger came out with onions. My soda wasn't refilled the entire meal. Even with all of these problems, the server was not apologetic and almost seemed annoyed to be serving us. We asked for a different side other than fries bc they were so greasy, but they don't have any other options. We asked for something as simple as ranch dressing, they don't have ranch. Just an amazing culmination of let downs one after the next. To top it off there is zero parking outside, so good luck!  The burger was mediocre at best.",

I would say that our food was okay, but it didn't really meet my expectations. We shared some pierogis with sauerkraut, which were tasty enough, but just barely whet our appetite. My fancy burger involved sausage and sauerkraut, and it was decent. My date made his own burger, and he mentioned that the meat was not as hot temperature-wise as he wanted. At the end, we had a delicious panna cotta dessert with raspberry sauce and a shortbread cookie.   As my date brought up, I think the reason we were underwhelmed is because it's hard to compare our burgers here to ones we thought were equally good at Stack'd or Purgatory for a fraction of the price (especially Stack'd $3 burger deal).",

    "text": "We went to Butterjoint for our last dinner in Pittsburgh and it was so solid. We arrived around 5:15 on a Saturday and had no problem getting a table, but the space is small and filled up fairly quickly. We started with the pierogies which were delicious - almost as good as my grandmom's! The beer list was great and I enjoyed a couple Flying Fish Red Fish pints - this beer paired perfectly with the food.   Next up was the super fancy burger, which had gruyere, tomato, pickles and bacon. I requested the aioli on the side - it had flavors of curry and other spices and was a great dip for the fries. Service was on point and I really liked the vibes overall. My only disappointment was that I was looking forward to trying the sauerkraut balls but was told that the menu is seasonal so they are only offered in colder temps. No worries - I'll be seeking this place out on a future visit for sure!",

All the burgers at our table came out medium to medium well despite having been ordered medium rare. Sure the burger was good and a very nice consistency, but if it is a feature of your menu then you should be able to send it out of the kitchen at temp.   Our smoked bluefish spread, described as pate on the menu, was good but little more than a simple smoked fish spread found in upscale grocery stores. The accompanying 4 small crostini and 3 small partial pickle slices were meager for a $12 appetizer.   The atmosphere is somewhat cramped for a table of five. The service was a bit aloof and forgot a soft drink twice.   There are too many other places in Pittsburgh at this price point that serve more interesting, tasty, and creative food for me to return. I will probably skip Legume too, having read their menu and seeing the entrees our friends ordered that came from their menu.",

The drink specials are pretty great and the service is top notch.  For starters, we had the fries.  Nothing special here but they went well with my IPA.  The goat cheese and pepper jelly crustini made for a nice flavor / texture combination.  I washed this down with the beer.  For dinner, I elected to order off the Legume menu.  I had the Artic Char which I ordered medium rare.  It arrived as I like it.  The veggies that came with it were also fresh and grand.  Great Fish on a cold Pittsburgh day.  I also sampled the sweet potato ravioli.  These were quite enjoyable as well.  Nice texture.  Good sauce.",

The burger was soft but didn't fall apart, full of flavor but not too heavy. The cocktails are FANTASTIC. They have a bigger cocktail menu than a lot of restaurants and I was impressed with every one that I tasted. I recommend the Lydia, Beefeater with lime, blueberry aigre-doux and benedictine. It's tart and bitter with a lingering sweetness, perfect summer beverage. The only thing that I didn't care for was that they only have tallow fries. I wish they had vegetarian fries, because what is a burger without fries? The greens were a fine substitute, I suppose.",

On my most recent visit, I had a Spanish coffee, beef burger with the fixings of the tempeh version (miso mayo and kimchi) and the cardamom pot de creme. I didn't taste too much cardamom in the pot de creme, but it was the perfect consistency and sweetness. The black walnut cake and honey tea cake also sounded wonderful.   The burgers are huge and quite good here, but I don't think they're quite worth the $14-20 you could easily end up spending with the toppings. I definitely prefer Butterjoint for the seasonally changing cocktails and desserts.",

Upon walking in the bartender immediately and intensely told us to leave and that last call was over. I was confused and embarrassed, aside from going there all the time online it said they were open till 12. She said they recently changed their hours. The hours are not updated when you google the restaurant, and it seems like terrible business practice to kick out 3 potential patrons 45 minutes before closing while there is still a crowd with food and drinks. This time change, gruff staff, and hour prior to closing last call instead of letting people enjoy a casual drink has really taken away what I've always enjoyed about the place.",

I had the Imperial Daiquiri which had a fine blend of Two Indies rum , cherry and lime. We also got the bread pudding for dessert, which was absolutely delicious!!!

    "text": "5 for the great service, super friendly and easy to talk to bartenders, and cocktail bar ambience. I really felt comfortable coming in and sitting at the bar by myself. They had great drinks at a standard craft cocktail price, maybe a little cheaper. Really enjoyed my experience here, which is why this place gets 4 stars.   2.5 let me be clear, the food was good. It's just not worth $17 for what you get for the fancy burger. It was cooked well, seasoned well, and tasted like good quality meat. The portions were perfect. The biggest problem is that even though the meat was quality, was it really worth that much? Particularly because the toppings on it were lacking. The topping was mostly aioli and minimal cheese, a few tiny bits of onion straws, and I of there was anything else couldn't tell. if there was anything else on the burger.  It was pretty plain (maybe a bit salty) to me. The fries and the garlic aioli saved the dish though  Debatable if I'd give the food another shot, but will definitely, 100%, be back for drinks.",

    "text": "Butterjoint is best for a quick bite or a drink, with the logic behind that probably being that you'll go next door to the jointly-owned Legume if you want a more elaborate meal. I suppose it's more casual than the Legume, but not by much. The lighting is dim and it's upscale and contemporary. The space is small but I don't think I've ever waited (long) for seating, albeit sometimes at the bar. I've never had any issues with service.  The menu is small, and basically only includes appetizers, small shareable plates, and higher end burgers. I had the Fancy Burger last time and split a side of garlic scapes. Both were great, as usual. I believe you can also order off the Legume menu, but only during select times. Someone can correct me if I'm off with that.  Even if you're eating elsewhere, this is still one of the better bars you'll find nearby. They always have some great drafts and diverse cocktails. There's a wine list that I assume might be decent and they have happy hour specials. I like the Sazerac myself which I don't always find everywhere. There's a few non-alcoholic offerings as well.  Maybe I'm splitting hairs, but this is one of those times  when I wish I could do a half-star, because I'd go to 4.5. It's a great spot either way, but it just leaves me wanting a little bit more. I suppose Legume is the answer to that.",

    "text": "Decided to give butterjoint a try after having it come highly recommended. The place is right next to legume and there is easy street parking available. My husband and I both ordered the fancy burger medium. When we got the burgers they seemed over cooked and thus dry which was disappointing. In addition, the toppings included in the fancy burger are scare which some aoli, cheese and a tomato. I couldn't even tell if there was a tomato in the burger or not, it was really lacking fresh ingredients and was way too heavy for me. That combined with the over cooked meat was not the best combination. The fries are decent but nothing to write home about. Overall I wouldn't mind giving this place another try and maybe ordering something different or making sure they get the burger cooked properly. For the price point of a $17 burger though I was expecting more.",

It had fried onions, gruyere, and a basil pesto aioli. The fries and aioli were perfect as well.The only thing was I think they attempted to stamp fancy on my bun and it did not come out that well. Overall, a great place to grab a burger in the North Oakland area! Menu is small but good!",

Four of us squeezed into the little cubby by the front of the bar, where we enjoyed a couple of beers and tried to talk over the loud music. The food menu is short but quality: our table got one hamburger, one cheeseburger, and two orders of pierogis, one \"baller\" with sausage, sauerkraut, and greens, and the other with just the sausage and greens. The hamburgers were widely agreed to be some of the best ever tasted, and my friend kept going on about the greens. Portions are generous. We paid $20+ per person, including tip.",

    "text": "Butterjoint is the cool, hip, and more casual side of Legume. The menu is a little simpler (pro tip- you can order off the legume menu if you want). I came on a weeknight and had to wait for about 15 mins to be seated. It's not a huge space so it gets full fast, but they served us drinks as we waited so that was nice.   I had the fancy burger and it was delicious. It came branded \"fancy,\" which I just thought was so cool.   The cocktails are also delicious and many are made with local spirits. I had a coconut fruity concoction made with Maggie's Rum Farm rum and it was great.   Two small critiques, the drinks are pretty pricey, especially for Oakland. I think my cocktail was $12 or $14. Also, they were a little scattered on the wait list and didn't take our name initially. In a small popular space, it's important to be on top of this. People get cranky as they wait and especially if they get \"cut\" in the line.   Overall I had a nice time and I'd recommend Butterjoint for a low key dinner or drinks spot.",

The kielbasa is so flavorful, it was unreal.  The fancy burger we got this time around was pretty good, not as good as the others I've had. Don't get me wrong, it's still a fantastic tasting burger, but just the toppings didn't wow me. There was too much of the same texture; flavorful still. The tallow fries and garlic aioli, my favs.   Best pierogies I've had in Pittsburgh. And honestly this is one of the very few places that I think is worth the price. I don't come here often because of it, but it's definitely a worthy treat.",

    "text": "A friend recommended this place to me years ago, and I finally tried it for the first time after all this time being in Oakland. And what a pleasant surprise! I 100% trust the person that recommended it, but to be honest, I didn't think a place like this existed in Oakland...  Via the Yelp app, I added our party of 2 to the waitlist. Also, to my surprise, there were about four parties ahead of us with a wait time of about 35 minutes. So this place must be good, right? We arrived earlier than scheduled, checked in, and they allowed us to start a tab at the bar while we waited. The space is pretty tight. There are about 4-6 tables along the wall as soon as you walk in, a bar, and then about 6 tables at the back of the slender space. We had to continue to move out the way of the servers and other patrons as we stood waiting with our drinks. I ordered the New York Sour which features bourbon and it was excellent. I drank it a little too quickly it was good lol. My friend ordered the Doctor Bird featuring rum which I later tried. Both $12 drinks.   One thing was for sure, the fries had to be good. The number of fry cones that passed us was crazy. And the chocolate truffle cake, a few of those had passed us as well. Finally, we were seated. Our server was awesome, totally chill and positive despite the busyness.   I ordered the Tallow Fries with aioli sauce. Fun fact: aioli sauce is a combination of olive oil and garlic sauce. I never knew that until yesterday. We also ordered the Pork Pate which I thought was interesting. Not something I would normally try so I was happy to dive into something different. As previously mentioned, I tried the Doctor Bird which was delicious but I still liked my New York Sour much better. My friend and I both ordered burgers. I would have liked my burger a little more done for 'well done' nonetheless the flavor was still great. Fresh lettuce and buttercup cheese to accompany it. And more fries with aioli! I might have become slightly obsessed yesterday.   To end the night, I ordered the Chocolate Truffle Cake because I had seen it too many times not to and my friend ordered the Root Beer Float. The cake is super rich and moist. You can't eat it too quickly and the whipped cream is super helpful with this. You also might want to share it; I didn't but you know there's always next time.   Overall, this place is super chill with a degree of upscale-ness. I can't wait to bring more friends here especially for happy hour. This was a last-minute adventure (sometimes the best kind), but next time I will be sure to plan ahead and get us on that waitlist sooner! 10/10 recommend.",

It was unique and flavorful.  Service was adequate, but not impressive. It's also extremely loud in the bar area, so be prepared to scream across the table at your date if you plan on having a conversation. Getting a table is also a little awkward because there isn't an obvious host stand. We just stood around the bar until one of the bartenders seated us.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were looking for a new place to check out on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving. After searching yelp, we decided to check out Butterjoint, as we both had never been and heard really great things! They do not take reservations for Butterjoint, but you can check the No Wait App to see what the seating is like. For those of you that do not know, Butterjoint is directly next to Legume, and offers a more casual dining experience in comparison to Legume. However, you can order food from Legume to eat at Butterjoint. They have a nice happy hour here- I took advantage of the $4 craft beer special. We waited at the bar for a few minutes before a table was free. Seating is limited here, as it's a pretty small place, so keep that in mind. We were seated in the back of the restaurant, surrounded by unique art and dimly lit lighting, which I really enjoyed. We went with the fried pickles as our appetizer. We really enjoyed them and the sun-dried tomato sauce they were served with. The batter was delicious and they weren't too greasy, which is a problem I find often when ordering fried pickles. For our meals, I went with the pierogies with grilled escarole $14 and Brendan went with the fancy burger (American Cheese, Sour Dill Relish, Crispy Onions, and Whole Grain Mustard Aioli) $17. The portion sizes are smaller here. It's plenty for a single serving, but not enough to take home leftovers. The pierogies were really good and the grilled escarole was a nice touch. I normally don't love homemade pierogies as they can be too thick, but these were perfect. The filling was delicious and they gave me plenty of carmelized onions on top, which I loved. Brendan is also super picky with pierogies and he liked them as well. The fancy burger was awesome as well. Super flavorful, juicy, fresh, and hilarious with the \"fancy\" label stamped right on the top burger bun. Overall, we had a really delicious meal at Butterjoint. I do think this place is a little pricey, but I also think the quality of the food matches the price. I would love to come back for happy hour or dinner again.",

Service was great, and the atmosphere was wonderful, but there were some major problems with the food. As a vegetarian, the options here are subpar at best. They offer grilled escarole as a veg replacement for their house \"tallow fries\" (which sound delicious!), but the escarole is absolutely disgusting. There is literally no noticeable seasoning, and it's completely carbonized on one end, yet slimy and weirdly wet on the other. No amount of salt and pepper could make this palatable. If they just stopped cooking their fries in animal fat, they wouldn't have to offer this nasty substitution.  The tempeh burger was really delicious, though the patty could use a slightly finer grind. Dessert (apple-pear crumble) was also tasty but served lukewarm.  All in all a beautiful place to get a drink and a meat-based meal, but not for vegetarians!",

    "text": "Butterjoint is Legume's bar area.  It's basically a bar and a handful of tables that are first come first serve, although when I've been there and it was super crowded, they did offer to take a name to wait for a table.  It's on the small side so on a Saturday evening by 6pm, it's really crowded and only gets worse.  This makes it a little awkward to get a seat/table.  However, the ambience (when not ridiculously crowded) is great.  More casual than Legume.  The food, as would be expected being part of Legume, is excellent.  It's a basic menu of a few snacks/appetizers, burgers and pierogies, although you can order from the Legume menu if you want.  I have had the frites, the raclette and the burger.  All three are amazing.  Hands down, probably the best burger I've had in Pittsburgh.  My overall feeling is that if you can go at a non peak time, it's a great pick.  If it's a super busy time, you may feel overwhelmed from the crowd but if you don't have to wait too long, it's worth it.  Again, it's still a bar so it's not meant to be quite a restaurant, but I enjoy going there when I want some great food and drinks in a casual setting.",

    "text": "This was my second time at Butterjoint. The first time I stopped in was several months ago around 10 on a Friday night. This time around it was a Thursday night at 5:30. Butterjoint is located in one of the last  areas you'd probably think of if you were rattling off a list of areas/neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, North Oakland.  I can remember the first time going here and thinking it was a bit closer to the Carnegie Museums, but don't be fooled...it's a bit further away. I like this place because it has a warm and cozy feel. Their menu includes a wide array of specialty cocktails, beers, wines, and food. I honestly don't think the cocktails are pricey as they are right up there with bars of the same caliber (Acacia, Butcher in the Rye, and Livermore). A $12 cocktail used to be more of a once in a while kinda thing, but it's becoming more common lately, especially as newer, more unique places open in the city. On my most recent stop here, I managed to take advantage of a happy hour special (there were several). I can't recall the exact name/brand of the wine, but they were featuring a red and white for $5 a glass until 6:30. I arrived closer to 5:45 and sat at a high-top near the front window. The place was pretty packed with what I would assume were either early dinner guests or those also taking advantage of the specials, but by 6:30 the crowd has dispersed and openings were available at the bar.",

The bartenders and waitstaff have a great rapport with the locals and I like that you can order from both the bar menu and the Legume menu.  Only two things prevent this place from getting the full 5 stars: 1. Why \"butterjoint\" instead of the bar at Legume? Why the need to brand it as a new restaurant? 2. Very limited vegetarian options and virtually nonexistent vegan options. Tallow fries really don't taste that much better, and they're not worth the extra beef fat, in my opinion.  Still, a fantastic place. Gets crowded on the weekends and during happy hour so get there early!",

The platter had pickled turnips, green tomatoes, sauerkraut, spicy kimchi, and pickles.  Amazing!! Super yummy. The tallow fries were so tasty that we ended up ordering another order. There is a bar menu but you can also order from Legume's menu.  I ended up getting the scallops with the lentils! They were perfect.

We started with a couple of orders of pierogies.  I felt they were simply ok, and a bit overpriced for what they were.  I also found it to be misleading that the menu offers kielbasea, but you are served a piece of saussage.  Then, time for the main course - the burgers!  While I ordered my burger to be cooked medium rare, it came out medium well at best.  The bun was toasted lightly, which did add to the burger, but the total amount of bread was just too much.  I felt the flavor of the meat was lacking, and since it was so overdone, it was a bit dry.  The service was adequate, but not superb.  We were served fairly quickly after ordering, which is always nice.  I will say, the one element of the evening that did not disappoint was dessert.  I ordered the chocolate trouffle cake, and must say that it was quite delicious.  It was rich, moist, and chocoloatey - the perfect elements of a dessert.  If you want to try Butterjoint, I suggest visiting BRGR first to get your burger, and then finishing the night with the chocolate trouffle cake.  I was told this is the one dessert that is ALWAYS on the menu.",

The thing that really drew me to this place was the tallow appetizers. However when I went they were not serving that. It was a Friday happy hour and the whole reason I went was taken off of the menu. However I understand that sometimes ingredients run out and whatever excuse they may have had for its absence I will accept. Furthermore decent happy hour drink specials helped alleviate the problem. What i could not accept is that I had the single worst service of my life. This is sort of a hipster joint and I have never met a man that had more apathy to his job quality. I was at a table with five people and we saw so little of him it was comical. As this was a small bar and really not busy it was inexcusable.  After waiting for 20 minutes we finally asked him if would could order food at which point he said yes and then simply walked away for another 15 minutes before taking our order. The only thing worse than this mans service was his ridiculous mutton chops. I really hope this is not a typical experience at this place as decent food and drink specials could make this a very nice bar if the service was even remotely respectful.",

I think this may be my preferred place to sit because watching the bartenders mix up all of the creative cocktails is pretty entertaining.   My friend and I both had the burger which is made completely in house from high quality, local beef; they break down whole sides of beef to make their own master burger blend. I can say with complete conviction that the burger coming out of that kitchen is the best burger I've had anywhere in Pittsburgh. It was cooked edge to edge to a perfect medium rare (that's what the kitchen recommends), perfectly seasoned, and served on a white bun that holds up to the juiciness without being super bready.  Pair that with some shoestring fries cooked in tallow (rendered beef fat), a great beer, and you have a burger and fries meal that can't be beat.   I'm sure everything else on their limited menu is just as good as the burger and I can't wait to come back and try it all.",

After mulling both Butterjoint and Legume's menus for a bit, we decided to get the Goat Cheese Crostini (with an awesome house made pepper jam), the Vermont Raclette with Pickles (more or less a slab of melted cheese in a skillet with more crostini), and the Bread Pudding (my personal weakness and it didn't disappoint).  Service was great, and I just heard that Legume/BJ are offering lunch, so I'll definitely be going back.",

The reviews were pretty good and this was the only place that was serving food past 11pm.   Immediately walking in, we were greeted by the bartender. The service was all around good, which makes a world of a difference. My wife and I both orders the \"Fancy burger of the day\". The burger had bacon cured in house, locally grounded beef, and different toppings which I wish I could remember all of them. All I remember is that the burger was good.   I thought I would be upset because the menu was small, but after thinking about it, a small menu gives them a better chance at perfecting their foods. My assumption was correct. That was one of the best burgers I've had in a long time. That and a beer, my night was set!    The environment made for a nice chill bar with great people enjoying the night. Check it out!",

We were seated at a little table in the corner, and while we were waiting, servers continually came around refilling our drinks. I especially appreciated this as I was drinking iced tea.  My friends enjoyed dirty martinis and glasses of Grenache. They looked delicious, and my friends said they really enjoyed the drinks. To start, we shared the risotto balls. Yum! They were dough-y and gooey, and really delicious. We heard that the burgers are absolutely amazing, so we came to Butterjoint in the mood for burgers. We weren't disappointed.   I had a burger with American cheese and caramelized onions, and because they grind their meat fresh every day, I went ahead and ordered my burger cooked medium. It was really flavorful and melted in my mouth. It had just the right amount of red/pink for my taste, and the onions added an additional layer of flavor. The fries were yummy as well. They are the small, crispy, real potato-y kind. I was a fan.  Because we were all stuffed at this point, we said no to dessert. I would love to come back again and try dessert, or stop over to Legume and enjoy that menu as well.",

I met up with a group of friends seated in the back corner, and the server came over reasonably quickly to take my drink order.  I ordered a Ninth Ward (on special for $7) and it was fantastic.    However, we were having great difficulty hearing each other over the rather loud music, and the lack of anything soft in the room made being the noise that much more intolerable.  A friend asked our server if there was anything she could do, and her answer (no joke) was \"Well this IS a bar.\"  I definitely would come back here for the delicious cocktails, but if you're trying to attract people who aren't ordering PBR, let them chat and enjoy their drinks.  Butterjoint needs to work a bit harder on allowing the atmosphere to match the high-quality pours.",

The cocktails on the menu were fantastic (I had a strawberry cobbler and my friend had a peated martini...both delicious) but what really stood out were the drinks the bartender improvised based on my suggestions. I mentioned I wanted something with gin or silver tequila, not too bitter or sweet, and very clean-tasting and he came up with a cocktail that was both beautiful to look at and tasted even better. I had never had a drink with chartreuse before and he was dead-on with the suggestion/made sure I liked the taste & smell before mixing the drink. The decor is nice and dark and the food I saw looked spectacular (although I'll have to go back to heat). It's a bit expensive for me to be a regular drinking spot but, if you want a quality cocktail, this place delivers.  Update: I visited on a second occasion and tried the desserts which may give the drinks a run for their money. I'm not sure whether I loved my peach pound cake or Astoria cocktail more, although I want to give my bartender, Will, kudos again (had him both times) for another awesome suggestion.",

Hubby finished his with a smile, but noted it was not the best he had ever had. Mine was a little under done (ordered Medium well, was closer to medium), but tasty, very juicy. The big digs were the fries-- absolutely perfect, crispy, salty, a favorite-- and the kimchi. My husband gets kimchi wherever they have it and this was the best he had ever had, comparing it to the real deal from Korea. Very spicy, though, be prepared. He loves heat and it made him sweat. I ordered the house red wine, which was lovely. Ambiance was good, however the seats by the window were a little cold and the tables a little too small for comfort. Wait staff was kind and attentive. If I could give points, 4.2/5, would only add a bit more spice to the burger and aioli and cook the burger a bit longer.",

The wait was no big deal and we passed the time be having a few drinks.   After we found ourselves a table about thirty minutes later we ordered a wide array of the available bar food. Butterjoint sort of does twists on local cuisine favorites.  we ordered: Fried pickles, perogies and kielbasa, fried sauerkraut balls, pickled turnips, and the kimchi. Everything was superb, but the fried sauerkraut balls really stood out, a great spin on a Pittsburgh-style dish.  Drinks were sort of pricey, but well worth it. Food was a little more than the average bar fare prices, but again the quality was excellent. For two of us to eat and have a few drinks our tab ran somewhere around $70.  Great find. Will be back.",

The food was wonderful. Butterjoint has one of the best burgers in Pittsburgh, made with grass fed and finished local beef.

I am truly lucky to have a place like this a block from my apartment.  That said, there are a couple of reasons why this place gets 3 stars.  1) It's WAY too small.  I don't know a good time you can go and get a seat right away, but I have only been there once when that happened and it was in the middle of a blizzard. 2) The drinks are entirely too expensive.  Happy hour is OK, but I think $10 -$12 for a mixed drink is a bit much.   I get they are trying to be upscale, but I don't understand why there are so few bar choices between \"college dive bar\" and \"overpriced gastropub\" in Oakland.  Of course that's not Butterjoint's fault, but whatever.  Generally, I avoid the place as much as possible because just thinking about having to deal with the shoulder-to-shoulder overcrowded bar gives me social anxiety.",

It's because the finest bars aren't too fancy to put pierogies on a menu with artisinal cocktails, and the finest bar patrons aren't too preoccupied with with propriety to pair a Sazerac with sauerkraut. Even if there's going to be an inevitable, peculiar aftertaste about an hour later.  I stopped in yesterday for happy hour, to drink, eat, and read last week's New Yorker. Nobody commented on the me reading the magazine or the other guy across the bar reading his book. This puts Butterjoint in the sweet spot of Pittsburgh bars for me, a place where I casually can do my thing and nobody raises a ruckus. It's not too refined that it's uncooth to read at the bar, not to divey that a guy sitting next to me would derisively inquire \"what're you reading, smartypants?\"   When I arrived at 6pm, the bar was filled but for one seat. I took that one. By 7pm, things had cleared out as happy hour ended. You may want to consider your time of arrival if you are coming with a small group. It seemed like a number of people sat at the bar while waiting for their table next door at Legume.  The burger here is magnificent. It's compact, but dense and weighty, filling but not bloating. You could try the daily Fancy Burger, but know the essential is a strong offering. The default burger even without cheese is a flavorful, ideally sized sandwich for accompanying a drink or two.   Order it medium rare, I say. The shape and density of the patty means temperature more easily controlled and done-ness more even throughout, meaning you get a better low-temp burger experience here than you might elsewhere around town.",

A well curated draft list, good service, delightful ambiance, and cast-of-characters crowd provide for an ideal venue for a second date or nightcap. The Fries + Aioli were simple yet addictive; in fact, the full Legume menu is available 'til 9:00.  A return trip is surely in order (read: burger), but expect to pay for the refinement.",

The food menu is pretty limited, which is expected since it's a bar and there's a full restaurant next door.  We tried the perogies and some of the pate.  Both were good, but again, nothing astounding.  Although, now I see that we could have also ordered from the legume menu...  We had some cocktails and would definitely come back to try some of the others.  Overall, I'm mainly won over by the location, which is walking distance for me, and the fact that it wasn't too crowded at about 5:30pm.",

    "text": "This is formerly Legume Bar, and my friends and I have been frequenting after it opened 3 years ago since we live in the building above.  We've seen them go thru countless rounds of bartenders, menus, and decor changes, and we all unanimously agree it is perfect the way it is right now.  This is the bar we all wanted to live above. It is one long bar right when you walk in, made of dark wood, and the liquor is beautiful.  We come down for the best burgers in Pittsburgh every week.  When I say best burger, I mean it.  The meat is fresh ground 80/20 lean and fat. At medium rare, this thing sings to the red meat gods. So tender and juicy, never frozen, on artisan perfect buns with enough strength to hold the contents.  This is better than tessaros, better than eleven (big lean patty). In a different league compared to burgatory, brgr. The only burger that rivals it is Father's Office in Santa Monica / Culver City.  Do yourself a favor and come here.  Bar staff is like family, IPAs of all types always. on tap. I will dearly miss Butterjoint when I leave this city.",

It gives the distinct feeling that they do care for their craft and want to make you happy.  Then there's the food -- almost always worth ordering and locally sourced.  Sometimes a BIT on the salty side, but hey....time for more drinks.  The ambiance is great (although the temp gets a bit high typically) and cozy.    Parking available right across the street in the garage.",

I'm not one to lightly order a rare burger- but the quality of the beef at Butterjoint is second to none in the city. Cave aged Gruyere, onion jam, and an awesome bun all helped, but the beef was never secondary.  Tessaro's is a better bet if you have a large party looking for burgers.",

    "text": "This place is like a fancy Oakland speakeasy- which is cool considering the other, cheap and dirty options in the neighborhood.  I think it would be a great place for a HH spot for professionals.  The only downside is that this place is small and gets packed quickly.  I'm not a huge fan of standing up around a bar before 9pm -don't ask- so this place lost a few cool points.  I'm glad I wasn't feeling hungry for this exact reason.  If anyone is interested, I did recognize a few Pitt faculty and staff members there.  Just a heads up if you're trying to avoid your professors and advisors :)  Otherwise, a seemingly great selection of libations.  They had Mad Elf (a hot commodity in my book)! I'm sure I'll be back-my friends love it.",

I had the fancy burger of the week which had pimento cheese and fried onions and even though it had all that fancy stuff on it, I could still taste the quality, juiciness and flavor of the meat. The service and drinks were great too. Highly recommend!",
