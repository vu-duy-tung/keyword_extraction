They are a small restaurant with  only about ten tables, so you may have to wait, but it is totally worth the wait. If you mind waiting, avoid coming between 5-7 on wee knights. It is better in the warmer months, as they have a patio for relaxing with food and drinks. However, any issue with waiting is made up for with the amazing food. Carry out service is available, for beer and their whole menu. The dough is amazing, and you can tell that it is fresh made. Overall, an amazing experience. Nothing by here tastes mass produced,  and that is hard to find.",

On the other hand, if you have a young family and are looking for a laid back, family-friendly atmosphere to dine, go elsewhere.  My husband, toddler, and I a went there recently for dinner.  When we requested a high chair, the waitress/hostess looked at us with disdain and told us, \"there's probably one outside.\"  My husband went in search for it and found it was being used by someone else.  He then had to search for a staff member to ask for another; he was informed the restaurant only had one.  We could have a booster seat if we wanted it.  He then had to search for another staff member to request a booster seat.  After ten minutes of this kind of neglectful treatment by the wait staff, we left.  While I understand not all restaurants are family friendly, the undeniable lack of concern for patrons' needs was disappointing.  I can't comment on the food or beer selection as we didn't stay to enjoy any of it.  We will never eat at this restaurant again, with or without our child.",

We observed a lot of frustrated looking customers either trying to order or trying to pay. I only noticed one person handling the whole restaurant. It's not a big place, but she was completely overwhelmed. We left without getting a table after 15 minutes. There were several tables available.

The cost of the extras on the deep dish were pricy. The service was excellent. I debated on the number of stars I should give on this review. I went middle of the road.

I've had a lot worse but it was not up to par that is for sure.  To many screaming kids.  I wanted a good beer and pizza but got a headache.  On a Friday night as well.  I counted almost 1/3 of the tables had small children. (Talking 2 or 3 years old). Maybe that was bad luck on us but either way.  Not cool.  I would bring my kids there, at least. Or that young.  Most of the tables are not suited for small children.  They are high and have stools.  A little small and tight because it may have to many tables.  I really want to like this place but as a first impression.  They failed...",

We witnessed another waitress sitting on a table while taking a customers order, sorry but, tables are for glasses, not @sses. Also ordered 4 different types of wings the sauces were all basically the same. Also you must pay .75 per celery and .75 per ranch or blue cheese with your wings. Unprofessional, overpriced and just not good. It's a shame that sub par food and service is the new normal.",

    "text": "Waited for quite a while to be waited on. Probably 10-15 minutes. She took a drink order and had to ask to please take entire order as I didn't want to wait again. Ordered a $9.99 buffalo chicken sandwich. Says it comes with fries and cheese on it. I asked for no cheese but instead of cheese substitute out a little lettuce instead. After a wait the sandwich comes out and is handed to me and the person leaves immediately. Never asked if there was anything else I needed. Typically when the runner delivers the food they ask that. It would have been helpful as the sandwich didn't have any lettuce like I asked. I waited 10 minutes and my server never came back. It seemed obvious that something wasn't right because I sat with food and didn't eat any. I finally asked the server working with the folks beside me to please get lettuce for me. Seems like a petty thing perhaps, but it's how I ordered the food.  Then when I get my bill the sandwich rang up at $11.38?? Not sure what that's about. I removed cheese and asked for lettuce. So if you up charge that's fine but it seems an odd amount, $1.39??? Didn't notice this until my card had already been swiped.  I'm not sure I'll return which is too bad. Perhaps the other location is better. I went primarily for the beer selection. The sandwich wasn't bad once I finally got what I wanted, too bad it took so long for service and waiting for someone else to correct the error.",

My kids got fries and chicken tenders, which were also good, considering it's a pizza place. My favorite part was their speciality Epic aged Stout; left over from craft beer week. It was delicious! So the reason I gave it only three stars: The pizza I got was on the expensive side; which is good for the quality they clearly put in it, but at the end of the day, I was not overly impressed with the flavor. Until I added BBQ sauce. For a few dollars more, I feel BJ's stands out a bit more for me; even if it is a chain...",

The beer selection was little light on IPAs. The waitress forgot our appetizer order and they brought the wings and pizza at the same time. We ordered Porky's Revenge pizza - basically meat lovers. It was supposed to be thin crust and it ended up being an undercooked doughy mess. The last straw was the waitress completely gave us and the couple we were with the wrong items on our tabs. One and done.",

    "text": "Ended up here on a Saturday night as the dinner spot we had wanted to go to had a super long wait.   I have never been here before and didn't even know this place existed even thought I've been in the shopping plaza on Route 8 where it sits many times. Caliente is at the end of a shopping plaza in a small brick building. I wasn't sure what to expect, but Fiance always drove by it and wanted to give it a go.   Caliente is seat yourself and there are only a few tables inside the small space, but it wasn't overly crowded at all. We sat down right away and the hostess and waitress were both super friendly and very attentive. We didn't have to wait for menus or water. Its a standard American bar food type of place - they have wings, burgers, good beer selection, sandwiches and award winning pizzas. There are also \"rolls\" on the menu with super tasty flavors like jalapeno, cheddar bacon, buffalo chicken, and pizza. I think I would head back for those alone. They looked really good.   We started with their standard medium hot wings -they were really good - not greasy, super hot and fresh, crispy and not battered. They were even thrown on the grill at some point as well and had some spots of tasty char on them. The wing sauce was good - flavorful and not overly spicy and the homemade blue cheese was good also.   Fiance went with the Hawaiian pizza and I had the bacon cheeseburger. My burger was really GOOD. Super juicy, cooked perfectly and not greasy. Their fries were also really good - whole, real potatoes and crispy. The pizza was also VERY good. The crust was chewy in the best possible way and also crispy on the bottom. The Hawaiian came with pineapple, ham AND bacon for added fun and calories. It was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. The food here is very reminiscent of Gateway Grill in Monroeville - really good burgers, fries, and pizzas. So, if you have been there and liked it, you will like it here for sure!   One thing I will note is the volume of the radio/stereo system in this place - it was being turned SUPER high to the point that we had to shout at each other to talk and then it would be shut off completely, or turned down very low. It was a little annoying as it fluctuated throughout our whole meal, but nothing to stop me from coming back.   This is a solid place for a dinner out if you are in the area and dont want the usual chains that sit all over Route 8. Definitely better and worth the trip!",

Had to go to the bar for refills, check,box etc.   I addition the prices are quite high for a pizza place that serves your food on paper plates with plastic ware.    If your a beer drinker  pay attention to the smoke and mirror routine they pull with the glassware most of the beers are served in. $6.5 or $7 for an average abc beer in a snifter or tulip glass.    This place e needs to make up its mind if it a restaurant or a take out pizza place.  It would be way more efficient if you had the customer order all drinks and food at the bar and have a runner bring it to their table.   Won't be going back",

The food during the week is always awful, 90% of the time (even on weekends) something is wrong or not delivered. I've had wings delivered pink and uncooked as well as inconsistent food ingredients. My husband and I have complained and have given many chances for things to be fixed but it seems to fall on deaf ears. Is it too much to ask to get food delivered exactly how I order and pay for?!

Having said this, they should tell you that there is a delivery fee tacked on to the bill when you order delivery.  I don't think it's unreasonable to charge a delivery fee, but they should tell you this when you place an order because most pizza places in the area do not charge to deliver.",

    "text": "Decided to give this place a try on friends recommendation and were glad we did.  We stopped in at dinner time on a busy Friday which may have been our mistake as it was extremely busy.  We got the only two top table which was next to the beer cooler and a bit cramped.  This is a small place and very popular.   They have a good craft beer draft list and our first beers came very quickly.  Had the Parm-garlic fries as an appetizer which were fresh and tasty. Had to have a pizza and went with the traditional white. Another good choice. Crust is thick and doughy if that is what you like.  You are able to create your own craft six pack to go from a good variety of craft choices.   Would stop here again but try to avoid busy times if possible.",
