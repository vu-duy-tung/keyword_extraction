I discovered this after I asked if she was ok. Her friends then proceeded to come outside and yell at me.  I did call the police.  I can't believe this is the kind of thing that you allow and your security guards are involved.  After seeing this behavior you all should be shit down.

So with that said you have to be understanding you're clearly not going to be waiting on in the first 30 seconds. However, whenever you do get served it's always exceptional service. Everyone is always so nice and professional. I have yet to have a bad experience here.   There is a room with a different theme and it's executed perfectly. It draws different age groups every weekend which just shows anyone can have a good time there.   The food is always perfect they have a wide variety and if you do have a problem the management staff is always so nice to help fix or change anything.   The live band is always so great and it keeps things fun. They have a dj after a certain time so you're guaranteed to find something you like about this place.   The outside areas is always nice they have lit fire pits and couches to relax.   Will recommend this place to anyone!",

Other than that the drinks are extremely overpriced and you usually have to wait in a long line to get in at night. Felicia is always super attentive and extremely friendly. She can wait on three people at the same time but still make you feel like you are the only one at the bar she is taking care of. She is super efficient and has bartending down to a science, that others need to take notes on. Sharon is also the most loving and friendliest person. Whether you have a headache, need to freshen up after dancing in the 90s room, or just need someone to talk to she has you covered. If it wasn't for Felicia and Sharon I most likely would not go to tequila cowboy.",

    "text": "I understand that yesterday was an exceptional day because of the Pens parade...but knowing as such, every restaurant in town should have been prepared!  Tequila Cowboy was NOT! I was laughing after we first sat down that I had noticed the servers were intentionally not making eye contact with people as they passed, so that nobody would try to get their attention.  When the server did finally make it over to our table, she informed us that the manager screwed up and only scheduled 2 servers for that shift?!?!?    So for the remainder of this review, go off the premise that yes, this manager who created the schedule should be fired immediately!   The server was nice enough for how busy they were, and we put in our food order with the drinks the first time she came over, since it had taken a while to get her there in the first place...Now keep in mind, we ordered 2 chicken quesadillas, a hot dog, and chicken fingers...nothing complicated AT ALL. So there we sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...and sat...we watched other tables come in and get their food, which looked more complicated than ours, eat, and leave...we sat...and sat...and sat...after an hour and a half, I went and found our server who told me it might be another 20 minutes?!?!?  20 minutes is all it should have taken for this order in the first place!  Then as the 2 hour mark approached, out came 3 of the 4 meals...missing was my quesadilla, because all I wanted in mine was the chicken and cheese...I know I know, VERY complicated. The server went in the back, where I assume she yelled at the cook to get my food out there, where I again assume his response was something like, \"Fine!  I'm not even gonna cook it then!\"  Because when she brought out my quesadilla, after the first bite I realize the chicken is COLD...not just cool...COLD...and the cheese wasn't even melted AT ALL!!!  Literally, it was cold chicken and shredded cheese inside a shell?!?!?  At this point, I ask the server to send the manager over...He comes over to tell us about the parade...yes, we know about the parade, we were there...bottom line is you were not prepared while you should have been!  I'm guessing by his attitude that he was the idiot who made the schedule, and is the one who should be fired himself.  He tried to give some BS answer that even if he had 2 or 3 more cooks scheduled that it wouldn't have made any difference...which was quite laughable!  Needless to say, I did not pay for this quesadilla though!  This would not have happened at Burgatory or any of the other restaurants that know how to properly schedule their employees!  I guess we found out the reason why we were able to find a table right away at this place!  Next time, just wait a little bit longer for a table at a better restaurant!",

A security guard came up to me & informed me I needed to put my vape away (not being used, just on the table). The only upside was that I didn't have to pay a cover.

    "text": "Don't get me wrong, I love a packed nightclub but this place is just ridiculous! It has three parts (90's, Karaoke, and Country) plus a mechanical bull. This place has lines that wrap all the way around the building, it's stiflingly hot, and it takes FOREVER to get to the bathroom (there is only one bathroom for all three parts of the bar and it's all the way in the back of the place. The dance floors are always super sticky and wet with the occasional glass or bottle on the ground.   If you want to ride the bull you get first preference if you have a wad of cash for the operator or if you are a pretty girl wearing something short. It's definitely not first come first served which I have seen make a TON of people mad.   Many of the bartenders seem to be fresh out of highschool and don't really know what they're doing which gets to be very frustrating for people waiting in line to get to the bar then to be met with people who underpour and often don't even know how to make shots is a major turnoff.   If you're looking for a massive collection of jerky guys and sweatily being hit on, this place would be for you. I only go here if my group drags me because it just really isn't fun.",

As far as I could tell there were three bartenders working, so it seemed easier to just head to the bar for quick service. Myself, my friend, and her mother were bypassed by two of the bartenders a few times (we were surrounded by young dudes, I get it, that's where the bulk of their tips come from I guess). When we did finally order drinks, the one bartender told us the total and waited for us to pay her right away. I would have kept it open probably. I won't lie, it felt rude. But this review is as high as it is because a bartender who introduced herself as Carly approached us to see how we were doing a few moments later. She was AWESOME. Explained cocktail lists to us, made us cool drinks to try and take pictures of...I'm sure we were kind of a pain taking up her time, but she never seemed rushed or annoyed. So friendly and personable. The service world could use more Carlys. Next time I'm in Pittsburg, I'll be back. Can't review on food as we did not eat. The cocktails were very tasty and the beer was cold.",

Drinks are extremely pricey as to be expected in the North Shore. It is packed on game days and weekends. It draws a very random crowd, and there's nothing wrong with that, but this bars entire scene is just not really my style. I'll stop in if my friends want to but other than that, I prefer other spots in the city.   Oh, but their Bloody Mary is actually the best I've ever had.

I enjoyed the atmosphere and the overall chaos of karaoke section, mechanical bull, multiple dance stages, multiple bars.   I was disappointed by the amount of alcohol the place either ran out of or didn't carry. I was told that they ran out of tequila? I'm like, but the name is tequila cowboy. I mean either the bartender is lying or they can't figure out how to stock.   There was definitely a lack of hustle behind the bars it took about 15-20 minutes to get a drink everytime. I had an appetizer of loaded fries and it was everything I could have wanted.   Music was great. Definitely catering to the 90's crowd.  Saw quite a few people getting throw out. Guess they can't keep the place under control with security.  Likely to come back just not gonna spend money on drinks",

    "text": "Pittsburgh's nightlife hasn't been the same since the closure of the numerous clubs in Station Square, which is now a parking lot. Whim had memories. If you went to Whim and couldn't find something you liked, you just needed stay indoors but with that void comes great opportunity. Nashville based Tequila Cowboy saw that opportunity and immediately seized it.   Walking into the establishment, I was immediately aware that Pittsburgh didn't have anything like Tequila Cowboy. It reminded me of the many Texas clubs I've encountered while briefly living there a few years ago.  What makes Tequila Cowboy special is the fact that it's several bars in one. The main bar features a mechanical bull , which is loads of fun and no worries about dying because you're surrounded by a sea of foam. Then if you keep walking you'll enter WannaB's;  this karaoke bar is a great time and you'll soon learn that if you don't know how to sing you're good and if you don't know a country song just pick what you do know and the DJ will kindly play it. The staff here is so friendly that they'll have you coming back even if they don't have free samples in tow. Although, they didn't offer any food you could buy I did try the boneless chicken bites, which smelled spicier than they appeared (thank goodness) and me and my girlfriends devoured them.  After you get tired of the mechanical bull, the live band, the karaoke at WannaB's and the dance floor do indulge in their crazy long selection of drafts on tap. I loved the fact that Tequila Cowboys included local craft brews even though I preferred Angry Orchard. I was glad to have options. Not one staff member made me feel out of place and I was shocked on my way out and noticed that their patio has a fire pit, which will definitely come in handy on cool Pittsburgh days. It's one of three nightlife places that has a fire pit which is a huge bonus.  After enjoying the live music, the guitars on the ceiling, the awesome drinks, the dancing and the mechanic bull, I will definitely be checking out Tequila Cowboy again. I have a bone to master that mechanical bull even if the staff is managing it! Pittsburgh needed a great dance floor and Tequila Cowboy saw it and seized it.",

The place was packed (as it always is) and we navigated our way through all the bars until we found a vacant table. There really is no seating system, you kind of wander around until you find an empty table. A little bit of a cluster.  I ordered the Jolly Roger, which was a sub with pierogies, kielbasa, and mustard. It was large and good. Other people in my party ordered the chili dog (monstrous and good), and the chicken fingers, which weren't that impressive. Lots of drink options. I ordered an Iron City pounder and it wasn't exactly cold... so that stunk. But, our service was on point considering the waitress had a full and large section to cover. She was great.   It's just a very cool atmosphere, like I said a country novelty type place. I know the line at night to get in is around the building. One of the hot night life spots for 20 something year olds. But, for a 6pm spot to grab a bite to eat before a game and drink some brews... it was fine.",

The bar is setup very well for the types of crowds that it attracts. There were a lot of people in this bar and there was plenty of space on the dance for. The 90s bar is pretty cool but a lot of people cram on there because the outside bar is connected to it. If you can get through there and hit the larger inside bar you'll be set. They have at least 3 bars that you can buy drinks and food, so you can get a drink pretty quickly. They have tables if you want to sit down and just try to relax. A bit hit is the bull you can ride. I think it's based on donations and it's pretty fun. The line isn't usually too long. I think over all it's a good bar to visit on game day or Saturday night !",

Long line to get in on Friday/Saturday night, over priced drinks, long bathroom lines, shoulder to shoulder in every room you go, and long wait for drinks.  Typically, the floor is so sticky your shoes stick to the floor. I've gotten food here while watching the steelers play, nothing impressive, just your typical bar food. The only good things about tequila cowboy is the outdoor bar & the wide selection of music. Depending on what room you're in, you'll hear anything from country to rock to 90s favorites or pop hits. What I hate most is there is only 1 bathroom and it's in the far back left corner making it difficult to get to from outside or the front bar with a limited number or stalls, long long line and always out of TP! Seriously ladies, bring your own in your purse. I personally only come here if I am with a group who won't go anywhere else bc of the lines, bathroom situation and drink prices. In my opinion, you're better off going somewhere else in the north shore.  Fun bar to try a few times, but not to be a regular.",

We went for drinks before the Pirates game and then met some friends there after, later that night. Before it was modestly busy for the downtown area and we were able to get a seat at the bar immediately. I was also able to ride on the mechanical bull immediately. ;)  Prices were cheap, it was super touristy and they have all kinds of local beers. Loved it especially the nightlife crowd. It does get packed, but it's huge indoors and there's a karaoke bar, a tequila bar, and multiple dance floors. It does get packed, but there are enough bartenders at hand to get to everyone!  As a non-local it was exactly what I was looking for, for a mini-vacay.   Go to Tequila Cowboy for the country jams, booze, and good times.",

It's definitely a mixed age group (I've seen people 21-50), and it's always a fun vibe. One time I came they had a DJ, and another they had a live band. I love that they have two separate rooms (one with country music, and one is a karaoke bar.) It's definitely fun to walk around, drink, and dance with your friends. The staff is always super nice, and the guys at the door are always so welcoming! (Thanks Victor!!!)",

The place was packed at 10pm on a Friday night and it seemed like all the guys were wearing plaid. It's definitely popular. Plenty of people were dancing, taking shots, and having a good time.The concept is interesting, but the execution isn't quite there. Operationally, Tequila Cowboy has a long way to go.   I'm know I'm not the type of clientele that Tequila Cowboy seeks to draw - I much prefer cocktail bars and having a little bit of space. With that said, I end up in the rowdier night life type bar sometimes and this was definitely one of the worst experiences. It was almost impossible to get around between rooms because it was so packed and the lack of clear paths between the kitchen and the bars made it almost impossible for the staff to deliver their food. The flow of traffic could have been designed better for sure and there aren't clear exit signs for when you want to leave.   Also, maybe it's a Pittsburgh thing but I was so disappointed to see so many plastic cups. Even the dive bars I've been to (albeit in Portland) used proper glassware.",

    "text": "I want to start off by saying that Tequila Cowboy is not my typical scene, in which I prefer a more laid back setting if I'm going to go to a bar. However, Tequila Cowboy satisfies the absence of dance clubs in Pittsburgh and as such, it draws a HUGE crowd to the North Shore. It's nice seeing people gather there even when there aren't any games or events at the stadiums. With that said, it is incredibly difficult to get a drink and it's tough getting around the several themed rooms they have. From what I could tell, they have a country room, a karaoke bar, and a 90s themed music room. There are people everywhere you turn. So I get it, large crowds are expected at dance clubs but like other Yelpers pointed out, it makes it incredibly difficult to find the bathroom since they only have ONE! For a space this large and so intricately laid out, you'd think they'd have a bathroom in each themed space. FYI, the bathroom is in the karaoke bar.   This isn't my scene so I personally won't be returning often, but I can see how Tequila Cowboy would be a great place for a night out for some folks.",

I met some friends who recommended this place to watch the College League Playoff Games.   Now this is not the place to watch football games (or better yet to listen to the games).   There are multiple bars in the location.  While watching the game, it felt like 1000 Santa Clauses walked in.  Apparently there was a Santa Claus Bar Hop going on.   What made this even more amusing was that Tequila Cowboy has a mechanical bull.   The thought of seeing drunk Santa Clauses on a Mechanical Bull was great comedy.  The overall experience was one of fun on a Saturday afternoon.   Drinks were good and Santa Clauses were fun to watch.     They appear to have live bands that will play and is probably why the place gets really crowded at night.   We were early enough to not feel the crowd.     Pro's - Huge - Good drink selection - We could watch the game (not hear it) - Had a great atmosphere / good time  - Live Music  Con's - Gets crowded - I kept getting lost finding / returning from the restroom (the place is like a maze)  All in all - I will visit again but probably during the day.",

I thought it might just be a much a mixers and little tequila, but there was a decent amount of alcohol in them (we took an Uber back to the Air bnb and took the best nap).

It's a scene for twenty-somethings with a very college bar/club vibe. I've also seen a few bachelorette parties and others with a young, wild side enjoying their time here.   I've found you get more bang for you buck in your drink when you go during less busy hours - my drinks have been insanely watered down on weekend nights and definitely not worth the price.   Tequila Cowboy is definitely what you make it - if you go in with a bad attitude, you're not going to have a good time.

Every time we come we make it a point to try a new restaurant in the city and every time we come tequila cowboy has been packed. That being said we got to the city earlier this year and ate at tequila cowboy.    It was around 430-5pm and it was not very busy. The inside looked nice and there was 3 separate bar areas which I thought was cool especially for the night life. There's a nice big stage, a bull riding area, and their very own tequila bar slightly elevated above the stage so you could see everything.   When we walked in there was not host/hostess at the front to greet or seat us so just stood around for a few minutes before just seating ourselves. (Still unsure how that all works) after we sat we were greeted by our server and everything was fine. We ordered he dirty kettle chips as an app for the table and Man was I impressed!!! A full plate of perfectly cooked homemade kettle chips smothered in a queso sauce, bbq sauce, cheddar and jack cheeses, chives and a hearty portion of delicious pulled pork. By far one of the best appetizers I have in a long time. For dinner I ordered the Memphis burger. Cooked perfectly at medium rare this burger was topped with onion straws, cheddar cheese, and pulled pork with a nice bbq sauce. Other dishes ordered was the pulled pork sandwich, a spicy chicken sandwich ( so hot the person who ordered it was almost sweating) and the giant order of Mac and cheese. There was no complaints about any of the food and the service (after we sat ourselves) was fine.  All in all this place seems like it makes a nice spot for some drinking with friends, live music and some good bar food. I would give it 5 stars but the whole 5 minutes of uncertainty when you walk in took a star from me. Atleast have a sign that says \"welcome please seat yourself\" or have the bar tenders pay more attention and when they see people standing at the door clearly confused help them out.",

The service was quick and the deals were nice (5 dollar apps and 2 dollars of drafts & more). We had the nachos and the boneless wings to start. Both were good, the wing portion was small. For our meals she had the cheeseburger and I had the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. My sandwich was SO large and tasty. Much more spicy than I've ever had, but that's a good thing because I really enjoy spice. We will be back for the food! (Not just the party at night)",

    "text": "Tequila Cowboy is a popular stop for any night out in the North Side. Between the many different themed rooms, live performances, infamous mechanical bull, and country vibe, TC attracts quite the crowd. Their drinks are a little more on the expensive side, but the bar goers usually consists of individuals already out of college.  On another note, Tequila Cowboy also offers quite a nice happy hour. The deals are incredible with$5 appetizers and $7 huge margaritas. The food was decent, and the margaritas tasted great. Unfortunately, they're a little strong and VERY sugary. They would make anybody feel ill. The deal was good though, and the wait staff were excellent.  In the end, I would recommend TC to a friend. I would like to check out their happy hour again to explore the drink menu. It's always an enjoyable time, but I would definitely send a warning about the margaritas!",

The management was very reassuring that things are changing there and that some of the past employees (hotheaded bouncers and rude bathroom attendant) were no longer working there because of the poor customer service they were providing.  Still only giving this place 4/5 stars because the price of drinks is still a bit outrageous.  I did order an appetizer and it was extremely good and presented very well.",

They a selection of appetizers, burgers, tacos, salads, melts, tostadas, and so much more. They have a great variety for such an interesting place.   We started with the pretzels and queso. They were okay - the pretzels were a little hard and burnt. However, the queso was good.   I had the steak salad for my entree. All Pittsburgh salads gotta come with fries.. right? The steak was cooked well and I didn't get any fatty pieces. However, I asked for no onions and they gave me onions anyways. Overall, I enjoyed the salad though and would definitely get it again!

No cover but drinks are pricey and usually weak. A beer is $5. The floor is always sticky! The restrooms are often a mess and not always taken care of. The place gets so packed on the weekends so be prepared for a crowd. If you want food I'd go somewhere else. It's prob the last place I'd eat. I'd recommend for a 21st birthday for sure.

    "text": "I have been to Tequila Cowboy several times, and I enjoyed the experience! Last night was a night that entirely shifted my perception of this establishment. I'm patiently waiting in line just like everyone else. I have my ID in my hand ready to give to the bouncer. I am a 22-year-old biracial woman from MD. The bouncer somehow immediately begins questioning my age after he attempts to break my REAL ID. He was a meathead so naturally he could bend anyone's ID with his bare hands. My REAL ID does not break despite his efforts. I tried to reassure him of my age and told him I did not appreciate him trying to break my real ID that I paid $50 for at the MVA and obviously need to drive around. I was slightly annoyed as anyone would be. Here I am, a college graduate with her own apartment, and I'm still being questioned about my age. I told the bouncer I had every right to be there just like everyone else. He then proceeded to tell me I had an \"attitude\" and I wouldn't be allowed in with my \"fake\" ID. He became very aggressive and angry when he spoke to me saying I shouldn't be talking to him any kind of way. All I could think of was what way was I supposed to be talking to someone that was rudely trying to tell me my age and destroy my property in front of me.   I ask him to speak with the manager politely. Before the manager even approaches me, he speaks with the bouncer. He fails to really listen or hear me out when I tell him what happened. I explained I was there for a friend's birthday, which I unfortunately missed, and that I had been there several times before. I asked him what more I had to do to prove my age. The bouncer then grabs a MD ID from a woman in the crowd. He doesn't bend her ID nearly as hard as he bent mine so he deems mine fake. What's worse?! He tells me people like me are a \"problem\" so I can't be allowed in. The manager then explains that people have been using fake MD IDs to get in and they questioned the line in the middle of my ID. Disclaimer: If this bar has been letting MD IDs in without the line down the center, then those IDs are fake. MD recently added the line down the center to make it easy to identify real IDs from fake IDs. Anyways, I am told to leave.   I proceed to find a police officer to verify my age. The officer took my ID and confirms that I am 22 years old. He walks over to the bouncer and lets him know that I am 22 years old and I have every right to get in that bar. The bouncer told the police officer that he still wouldn't be letting me in because I had an \"attitude.\" All I could think then was this was what being a black woman with curly hair and asserting yourself to a pompous asshole gets you in this life. The police officer kindly apologized and told me they wouldn't be letting me in. He even agreed that other women they were letting in looked younger than me, but said the business had the right to deny me service. I thanked the police officer, but I couldn't believe what I heard. This business discriminated against me.   As I'm leaving and on the phone explaining to my friend how I wouldn't make it to her birthday, I see a young woman intoxicated beyond all recognition being brought out of the bar by 4 men yet I'm the PROBLEM! All I can say is that Tequila Cowboy needs to train their bouncers to not carry biased notions about people and to respect their patrons and their patrons' property. They also need a class on how to tell a fake ID from a real ID. What happened to me last night was unacceptable and unethical on their part! I would not suggest going to this bar! My whole perception of this place changed last night! I most likely will never be returning and I will definitely be sharing this story with my friends and family. I am well connected with restaurant owners and bartenders here in Pittsburgh as well so I'm going to be sure to tell this story to my contacts. Unethical business here! I have never been treated the way I was treated last night at Tequila Cowboy by any bar in Pittsburgh. Based on the Yelp and Facebook reviews, the bouncers are violent and aggressive and management is piss poor. My experience can be added to the long list of individuals that were mistreated and abused by the staff at this bar.",

After waiting 15 minutes for a waitress I realized that I would have to walk back and forth to the bar for my food and drink orders. The drinks were good but if you go on a Sunday, expect a limited game day food menu. The soft pretzels were delicious. The burger and wings that we ordered were pretty basic. Again, this was the game day menu so I can't judge the menu as a whole. The restrooms were very clean and the attendant was very friendly. For some reason the floors were super sticky up by the tequila bar. I am definitely going to give this place a second shot because I understand growing pains and new staff. Plus I'd like to try their complete menu.",

This is about the 3rd time here and it keeps getting worse due to the service and lack of management. I'm sure at night with the concerts and other events they are more properly staffed and equipped to focus more on customer service. However, we were so disappointed on Sunday that we left without getting serviced and went down to Southern Tier. There are too many options on the north shore now to have to put up with bad service.",

When we asked the server if they had bottles she had no idea. One plus was I left my ray bans there and when I came back from my lunch across the street, the bartender had them for me.

We asked for a tequila list, and they don't have one, and there are only two bottles visible at the main bar even though it's called \"Tequila Cowboy.\" We were told that there's a tequila bar on the weekends, if we wanted tequila. So, we drank whiskey. My fiancee had to go to a table & grab silverware, plates, napkins and salt & pepper, because they didn't bring us any with our food at the bar. The food was decent, and there really aren't any qualms with the kitchen. Stick to partying here on the weekends. That's probably more in their wheelhouse.",

    "text": "Came in on a Sunday with my husband to watch the Steelers game. The floor is disgustingly sticky (some frat houses have cleaner floors) and the air is stale. My husband grabbed a beer on the way in at a cash-only tub and thank goodness he did - we waited for a bartender to acknowledge us at the bar to get another beer, a shot and a soda. Then we went to one of the bars in the backside (of the front bar). Waited a bit for another round of drinks. I was finally able to grab a barstool, no fault of TC - it was busy.   I wanted to grab some food so I tried to get the attention of one of three bartenders, two of which were BS'ing together and twirling their hair.  The menu on game day is normal - you can't expect a ton of options on one of the busiest days. I paid $11 for their cheese/bacon FF. The portion was extremely small and it looked as if it sat for some time under a heat lamp.    My husband ordered another beer and, granted the bartender did warn us the bar was slanted and if the bottle got wet, it might slip - but she did not give him a cocktail napkin to prevent the condensation to collect on the bottom and it slid right into my lap. I'm 5 months pregnant, didn't have a drop of alcohol but smelled like a brewery.   Also, they need to make sure to monitor the intoxication level of patrons. There were a few fights which were broken up quickly and the individuals taken to the back. There were also a lot of individuals that could hardly stand straight. I'm also a certified bartender with the proper training to pick out the drunks and prevent them from becoming a problem either in the establishment or on the street, they need to pay better attention to the safety of everyone and the liability of the bar.   Definitely a place to go crazy, have fun and get in trouble. I doubt I'll back, pregnant or not.",

    "text": "This is a nightlife type of bar. It's a fantastic addition to the North Shore. It's a huge space with multiple bars and rooms. If you go there looking for a nice place to eat, with great service, you might be disappointed. If you go for the drinks and entertainment, you won't regret it. I went Friday night and had a blast. The country singers were awesome and I didn't even have to pay cover to see them perform! That's unheard of these days. I hope that continues but as long as they keep the place clean/semi-classy, I'll keep going.",

We were told that you had to get a server's attention to put in an order.  Food was mediocre and for a place called Tequila Cowboy, they have a limited  selection of tequila.  The only reason they were busy b cause of concert.",

    "text": "Three of us walked in on a Friday night around 5:30. No one was at the hostess stand, we stood around for a few minutes and then went up to the bar to ask if we could just sit where ever. But no one at the bar even came up to us, so we just sat down outside. It took about 15 minutes for a waitress to come over. Service was slow the whole night, my friends got their food and I had to wait about 10-15 mins for my bowl of chili. My friend of chips and dip, and I got a lot more tortilla chips with my chili than he did his chips and dip. The chili was decent. My other friend asked for sour cream and never got it. Overall, the service needs to be improved, perhaps more servers? and the food was what you would expect.",

    "text": "Bouncers let me in and then while my group was singing karaoke bouncers came up to us and asked for our IDs again. Bouncers and the \"manager\" stated that my ID was fake and if I was unable to provide a 2nd photo ID I would have to leave. I didn't have a 2nd form but many other cards, including two credit cards and my health insurance card, with my name on it. They said that the \"font on my ID was too small and it was obviously a fake\". This was all from an overheard conversation that a friend I were having in the bathroom which lead to employee to report us. I allowed the bouncer to walk me out but it was a member of our party's birthday and the group asked to talk to the bouncer again.  After they looked at my ID again they stated that \"it was a DMV error and I should have it reprinted\". They quickly backtracked on their story and allowed me back in... all without an apology. I have been to Tequila Cowboy most of my weekends, but vow to never return and will inform all of my friends and family about the rude staff and policies. I understand that laws are strict but I have never been treated so unfairly or rudely by the staff of a bar before.",

We each tried two different flavor margaritas (my favorite was the mango) that were larger than my head, they were absolutely delicious and very cheap considering! Also had some nachos that hit the spot, definitely coming back soon.  Great addition to the bar scene in Pittsburgh!!",

    "text": "My acquaintance and I decided to give Tequila Cowboy a try on Friday, and we could not have had a better night!  We were met at the door by Chad, and he was extremely helpful.  He showed us around the place and got us a seat right at the bar.  The bartenders were quick to get us drinks, and they were made to perfection.  We ordered some food and our burgers were cooked just right.  At one point in the night, my acquaintance misplaced her ring that was passed down in her family for three generations.  Luckily, I found Chad and he let his staff know to look for a ring.  One of the bartenders found it where we were sitting, and it was returned in no time.  What a relief!  We enjoyed the rest of our night dancing and enjoying the vibrant atmosphere.    I would recommend this place to people of all ages.  All of the staff were kind and efficient.  I had a great time, and I will definitely be visiting again soon.",
