This is one of my favorite fast food restaurants (although I only classify chipotle as fast food because of their quick service,their food is fresh and delicious).  I recently used the online ordering for carry out and it was very easy and saved time by not having to wait in line since I was in a rush. The manager, Amanda, was very friendly and helpful.  I love this restaurant and I would recommend this place to everyone!",

I ordered chips and guacamole to share with my co-worker and a burrito bowl for myself. The chips and guac were very tasty! The guac was good, and the chips were perfectly light, crispy, and salty. However, my burrito bowl was disappointing. There was way too much rice, sour cream, and cheese and too little chicken, salsa, and lettuce.",

I was highly upset wbout this because it seems like the person was saying that because we were all Volunteers and not Paid or in uniforms that we didnt deserve it... in an area that is made up of mostly volunteer firefighters that kind of upset me... I'm not sure if I will be returning or not.",

While crowded the staff kept the line moving and quickly assembled out order. We found the staff friendly and efficient and was eating after a 5-minute wait. The food was good and typical of other Chipolte's, they get you in and get you out quick, and that's what I wanted. When busy the staff seems to let the trash cans over fill and fails to promptly clean tables. During our visit the trash cans were full and their were messy tables throughout the dining area. I will visit this Chipolte again when I am in the area hoping that the messy state of the restaurant was a one time event.",

I love the Subway-esque watch your food while it's being made thing and getting to pick how much of each ingredient gets put in your food. I eat both the bowls and burritos, lately preferring a vegetable bowl with guacamole (guac is free on veggi bowls and burritos!) and a side of chips. Everything is super fresh and I get a delicious meal for around $10.  A go-to place for a quick, cheap, yummy meal.",

The guacamole was way too salty and the red onion was in huge chunks, also the chicken was defintely on the burnt crunchy and not very good side. This location also has no chips almost every time I go. I find this location to be the absolute most unacceptable chipotle to date. You need to clean up, have a much better trained staff and then maybe I would consider coming back to your location. Other than that stick to literally any other chipotle they are 100 times better than this one. here is my personal message to management. You are pathetic in the way you run this chipotle.",

    "text": "My wife and I have been to Chipotle locations all over the region. As other reviewers have noted, the Chipotle location in West Mifflin is similar to the other Chipotle restaurants in the sense that it looks like a Chipotle restaurant and the menu items are the same. When it comes to the things that matter such as customer service, cleanliness, and taste, the West Mifflin location is severely lacking.   I visit this location when I must as it's closest to my home and work. I've been using the timer on my phone to calculate their average rate of production; 3.5 minutes. Yes, on average, this Chipotle location rings one customer order through the register every 3 1/2 minutes. If you've ever been to the Chipotle in Peters Twp. or Greensburg (which are equally busy), you've noticed that there's hardly ever a line. When a line does build up, the team of employees works together to get the customers taken care of. At the location in West Mifflin, employees are conversing with one another, texting, smoking refreshing cigarettes in back, or just clowining around in the grill area. On the rare occasion that an employee of the West Mifflin location does acknowledge your presence as a customer, the encounter typically won't be positive. Completely unacceptable and utterly frustrating.   The food at the West Mifflin Chipotle location is either absurdly salty or completely bland. Other Chipotle locations seem to be able to maintain consistency. Not West Mifflin. In addition, the steak is typically undercooked and full of gristle with the consistency of bubble gum. Now and then the chicken will be a little on the undercooked side as well. Portion sizes are laughable compared to other Chipotle locations. The iced tea is nearly always empty. Guacamole, sour cream, salsa, and various meats are usually nearly out or completely gone.   Tables, seating areas, and the fountain drink area are usually covered in food, napkins, plasticware, and strawpapers. I typically take a newspaper in with me and lay it down as a table cloth of sorts over top of remanants of the meals left behind by previous customers. Garbage cans are consistently full if not overflowing. Floors are perpetually dirty and somewhat sticky.  I was recently at another Chipotle location in the region that I often drive 30 minutes out of my way to frequent. The manager at the store, who makes it a point to know repeat customers by name, introduced me to some visiting Chipotle brass and explained that I was a frequent flyer there. The big manager thanked me and asked me and asked if I had any input that could be relayed to the home office in terms of improvement. I told him that each and every Chipotle that I visit is top notch with the exception of one: West Mifflin. When I said that, he smiled, giggled under his breath, and said \"Yeeeaaah. THAT one...\"  If you can make it to any Chipotle location other than West Mifflin, do yourself a favor and do so. If West Mifflin has been your only Chipotle experience, please don't judge the whole chain based on one incompetent location.",

It's spice so if that's not your thing then they also have chicken steak or carnitas(pulled pork). Also the corn salsa adds a great contrast to the spice.   Did I mention it's the only Mexican place in the area other then Taco Bell which I feel doesn't really count.",

Only to stand there, without explanation, while online orders were completed for what felt like a long time (more than a few minutes, think closer to 10). I feel like this is not the best way to go about fulfilling those orders when the restaurant is clearly packed. I also would like to thank whomever for the giant piece of grayish green avocado (I hope) in our guacamole. Not very appetizing.

We were there recently and the line was out of the door and around the building- no problem we waited 25 min- there was plenty of food and the employees were very friendly and just kept working, they stayed calm, the back kitchen was working hard to keep the food fresh and bins full. I state all of this to show the glaring difference at the west mifflin chipotle....  Every time I go to the west mifflin chipotle there is utter chaos... There could be 2 or 20 people in line and the staff is screaming at each other, yelling out for no actual reason, making noise, texting WITH GLOVES ON, running out of food, bumping into each other, never cleaning the place. I was there recently and the girl that was heating the tortillas was so rude to a customer I couldn't believe it. He asked for a burrito and she said oh you want a burger? I guess I could fashion you a burger... He repeated his burrito request and the girl kept going on and on- the MANAGER then jumped in and was laughing and adding to it- the kid was visibly uncomfortable.  Finally another employee told them to knock it off.   I downloaded the chipotle app for this location alone, to hopefully avoid being inside for longer than I have to... I am also afraid to use said app at the west mifflin chipotle for fear the idiots behind the counter won't know what to do.   One star for this location 4 stars for Greensburg, Robinson, and all other locations I'm sure...",

(I.e. \"I asked for fajita veggies...\" Or \"double chicken, remember?\" Or my own \"could I have more lettuce than that?\" when she put about eight shreds on my bowl.)  Even the food lacks. The chips are usually more chewy than crispy, the chicken tastes...different, and the steak chunks were so big my husband had to go get a knife and cup up the pieces.  It's just not worth it.

    "text": "I am not very happy with this particular Chipotle. I've been to this location a handful of times since it is very close to my home. I have tried to order online twice now and both times have been a disaster, especially because I have had two small children with me and the whole point is NOT to wait and be able to go in and get out quickly. The first time I ordered online they completely lost my order and had to go make it when I got there. The manager apologized and even threw in two drinks free of charge for me. That was fine and I was okay with that. The second time, today, though was not cool at all. I was to pick up my order at 11:15. I got there at 11:20 and they apparently hadn't even started on the order. I could have honestly got in line and ordered 20 burritos by the time the girl in the back finished my order. I think she was having a mental breakdown in the back. I understand everyone has bad days but she was running around barely doing anything, dropping several gloves on the floor, and doing everything so so slow. It was frustrating to me to say the least. My children were less than patient because it was past their lunch time. No one apologized or tried to make it right. I got my food at 11:35!! It was 20 minutes PAST the order pick up time and 15 minutes with my small children waiting. You guys need to get it together. I enjoy Chipotle, but this location needs better management and better trained employees. I'm not planning on returning to this place anytime soon and I highly discourage anyone to use their online ordering, especially at this location.",

Tonight there were so many employees on hand we couldn't count. That's not so bad except they were running out of staples like chicken, mild salsa, beans and rice... One worker pulled the empty bean tub and upon returning with a new one stopped to notice how filthy the work station was. No matter, he set the bean tub in its place and kept right on. Then, when I watched as our chicken was cut up, I noticed this work station was dirty too. Nobody cares to clean their work station as they go.  While our food was being prepared, the line backed up at the register because the cashier was standing in the back on his phone. The line workers we're calling for 'Patrick' several times while people's food was getting cold. Seriously? Onto the dining room. Tables were a mess and needed wiped off. Notice the common theme of nobody cleaning. The soda station had straw papers and napkins laying all around and looked like nobody services this area all day and into the evening.  Bottom line, we ate our dinner, but there were too many employees on hand who were bumping into each other out of complete disorganization.",

When they gave us such a small serving of rice, I asked for a side to make my meal more filling...the employee proceeded to fill a salsa cup with rice...

There are usually only two people on the line (including the cashier) and the rest of the employees are just loitering in the back. The line backs up, even at low volume times, and you will wait 20 minutes no matter when you go. Even if there are sufficient employees working the line, it's slow, because they move in a lackadaisical manner with no sense of urgency or concern for moving people through the line. It's the worst near closing time because all of the employees are doing their clean up jobs and side work and there is only one person serving the clientele. If reviews were based on food alone, this chipotle would probably earn 4 stars, which is the only reason I return. This needs a new manager and an entirely new staff.",

    "text": "I am confused by the masses of people who religiously go to chipotle. Today was my first visit and most definitely my last visit.  I brought my daughter for dinner around 7:30 on a Sunday. When we walked in there was no line so we went straight to the counter. My first impression was that it isexpensive. $7 dollars for three tacos and it doesn't even come with chips? At that point I normally would of left, but my daughter had a coupon for a free kids meal from her book club, so I figured it would even out the bill.   I was surprised by the lacking menu with only four items to choose from, (Burrito, burrito bowl, tacos, salad). Even worse was the slim pickings of toppings to fill the items on the lacking menu. No raw ingredients like peppers, olives, or onions. As a vegetarian, that left me with few options. Imagine Moe's, but now with way less to choose from, and tastes horrible. I decided to go with the soft tacos filled with beans, rice, lettuce and salsa. (What they call \"salsa\" is really just very dry pico de gallo.) My daughter got the \"build your own taco\" meal, which came with fruit. We also got an order of chips and queso.  When we sat down, my daughter opened her fruit, which was covered in mold. (By the way, it was a clemintine in a dressing cup, not peeled. Why they wasted a plastic container for an unpeeled orange is beyond me.) I took it back up to the counter and was given a small bag of chips instead. Both hers and mine chips were stale. So stale that they didnt even crunch or break, they were chewy. I took the chips back three times to exchange before just asking if I could return them. At that point they ended up refunding me back to my bank card. They didnt even seem to be phased and said the chips go stale often. Along with the stale chips and moldy fruit, nothing else was good either. The tacos were way too dry and tasted strange. My daughter also thought her meal tasted bad too, without me saying anything about mine. We ended up throwing everything away and going to Wendy's.  On top of it all the restuarant was filthy! Every single table in the place was dirty, and they were far from busy. The floor was so sticky that my flip flops were getting stuck to it. I'm not sure who out there loves chipotle, but it surely is not me.",

I'm not sure if they're using different seasonings or no seasonings at all. But the every time I come here, and get the SAME thing it taste different!!

Line was long we were okay just chatting and enjoying some time together. When we go up to order it went down hill quick! The guy who takes your order was so rude and gross. He was picking chicken up with his hands. There were utensils available but he did not use them. I spoke up when it was time for mine. I asked him not use his hands. He got smart with me and said I have gloves on. I told him I didn't care that I just watched him touch unsanitary handles. He seriously rolled his eyes and grabbed a little plastic container that they use for there salsa. He threw it away after he was done against the wall where the trash was looked at me and said next. I was like whoa wait he wouldn't  acknowledge me. I moved on the next area where the girl there was just as nasty. She used her hands to put cheese on my bowl. I guess it's just their thing there. But for real I watched them touch a pen, the register and the cooler with the same gloves they touch my food. Perhaps I'm just picky or whatever but I'm not going back. They are dirty in there. Not to mention slow as hell. Half of the workers look high. I'll stick to my own chicken bowls.",

Since the country is in the middle of a romaine lettuce E. coli crisis , not a leaf of lettuce to be found!  I guess they don't think to use a little spring mix, or even chopped ice berg to substitute.  I got my usual burrito bowl. Black beans, fajitas (they were so overlooked that they were no longer green and white but brown and mushy! ). The rice, which I don't get, was stuck together and so starchy- not the usual glistening looking rice that I have come to want!  One spoon of chicken, and well even with all four salsas...and a smidge of sour cream...the bowl was pathetically half full (no lettuce remember). I am kicking myself that the shock of it all prevented me from taking a picture to show you!  This is what happens to chain restaurants, they decline, decline, decline!  Even the fresh salsa was flavorless...maybe the cilantro was on e coli watch as well??  Did I mention the place was just overall dirty?  The tables, the floors....oh my!  You Chipotle at this location will never get another dime from this gal. Thanks but no thanks!  If you told me my first one star review would be for one of my go to places for the longest time, I wouldn't even believe you!!  YUCK!",

Some days, it's not so good. One thing they never can get consistent here is the vinaigrette dressing. Most of the time, I find that it doesn't meet the same quality that I would get at other Chipotle locations. There have been numerous times where the rice hasn't been cooked correctly, and when the rice isn't cooked correctly, it just ruins the whole meal.   I know it has nothing to do with this location specifically but Chipotle needs to bring back the Chorizo. The flavors complimented the other ingredients perfectly! Sacrificing the Chorizo in order to introduce the Queso was definitely a bad move! The queso texture is too grainy and is not up to Chipotle quality.",

Today the burrito \"artist\" for lack of a better title, when asked to not put the last remaining bit of old soggy fajita on my burrito when they were handing her fresh, she ignored me and piled it high, then from there grabbed one more from the new, creating a monstrosity. I said \"please start fresh I don't want that\" and she said \"that's protocol\" then when I persisted she threw it out. Meanwhile the line is getting longer and making me and my family look like the cause, there was no line when we showed up. So onto the \"replacement burrito, now I receive next to no rice before she hands it off to the next person, and I was grateful for a new person to help me resurrect this lifeless burrito. So I go through getting all the normal. We get our booth and everything's sweet until I bite into mine and find that I forgot the sour cream, no big deal that's my bad. I head back up to the register to request a side of sour cream, she was off to the side and didn't hear it was me that asked for it. Went to hand it nicely to the lady cashing out. \"Not for me\" the lady said, I said \"it's for me\" and she practically tossed it to me when I went to get it from her.... it's sad the treatment you can receive for simple being hungry. I did nothing anyone else wouldn't have done.  So now I've figured my family once a week eats here through the hit or miss quality of the food. That's easily over 1,000 a year to a burrito joint. Please fix this Chipotle we love you!",

    "text": "This Chipotle is not a Chipotle.  Upon entering I couldn't decide if I'd just missed a giant food fight or if the cleaning crew had gone on strike for a month. It was up for debate since the floor was littered with trash and the tables were covered with food remains. I was shocked. Secretly, I convinced myself it was just a product of a dinner rush.   There was only a short line, yet it was barely moving. The longer-than-usual wait, allowed me to make further observations of the chain. It was hard not to notice the dirty 'white' walls, grimy from grubby hands rubbing against them. The windows hadn't been washed. The trash was overflowing. There was an employee that appeared to be in charge of cleaning, but was only walking around looking dazed and confused. He did have a spray bottle in one hand and a towel in the other. I really wanted to explain how the 'trigger' on the spray bottle worked. But my growling stomach convinced me to stay in line.  When it was my turn to order, I was met by a less than enthusiastic girl. She never cracked a smile and was moving like a sloth. Either she possessed no personality or was stoned. It was actually the main topic of discussion during our meal. The rest of the crew (4 young females) were a touch better... but slow and inefficient. Two of the girls served no purpose on the assembly line whatsoever. The 'burrito wrapper' mutilated one member of my parties burrito and the 'cash register' girl apologized for the 'meat and rice' girl's attitude toward the woman in front of me. So I apparently missed some drama while I was drooling over the thought of my steak bowl.  My party of four crammed into a booth and devoured our food. The general consensus was the food wasn't as fresh as usual or consistent with other Chipotle experiences. Personally I think it was just the ambiance throwing everything off. The place was so dirty I decided to wash my hands before we left. BIG mistake!! The women's restroom was the filthiest I've ever seen. I'll spare you the details... but keep in mind, I was returning from a 13 hour road-trip from North Carolina... so I'd seen my fair share of disgusting restrooms already that day.  I love Chipotle. I eat there often. But this particular location is just a revolting mockery of one of the best fast-food chains I've come to know. It breaks my heart to admit this but my desire for a burrito bowl has diminished greatly since eating here. Hopefully in time I can recover. This restaurant is not the delicious, quick, and clean dining place that the Chipotle brand represents. I have higher expectations at a Taco Bell.   Shame on you Chipotle on Clairton Boulevard, shame on you!",

    "text": "I roll joints bigger than the fucking burrito they just dished out to me. It's poorly wrapped, the chicken fucking sucks, and they charged me for a fucking water cup. The workers are all gross and seem to have joy in fucking people's day up by giving everyone that steps through those doors the worst meal possible. I honestly hope this place blows up along with the fucking fat asses that work there. This chipotle sucked so bad that it inspired me to redownload yelp just to shit on this place. I literally couldn't have had a worse experience here, so if you do dare to ever come here make sure you bring someone you fucking hate.",
