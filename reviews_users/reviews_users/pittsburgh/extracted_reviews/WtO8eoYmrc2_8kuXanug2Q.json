    "text": "Well this visit started off good. I was seated right away, no wait. Was given a good beer selection of some PA Craft beers. Ordered the traditional deep dish pizza, but with no onions. Now after we ordered, it just went downhill from there. Was never asked if I wanted another beer, the waitress just gave me more water. My pizza still had onions in it. Which I stated right off the bat, that I didn't blame the girl who took my order. I know cooks can't read. I was one for many years. Mistakes happen, and the manger took care of it and took the item off my bill. NO complaints, still ate the food and it was good. Just not a fan of onions on my pizza.   Now onto the bill, the server continues to tell me that she was sorry for the mistake and declares she told the cooks not to add onions. I already said it was taking care of and there's no worries. She goes on to say that the next day was her birthday, and if I felt like leaving all my money as a tip, it wouldn't go unnoticed. I took this as a joke as I had told her earlier I worked in the industry. When I hand over the gift card I had on hand, she comes back and again repeats herself, tells me that cash as a tip is preferred as she doesn't have to claim it at the end of the night. And again if I felt like leaving her all my money, she would just be so freaking happy. Let me explain one thing and hopefully I am very clear on it. No server, and I mean NO server anywhere, should ever ask a guest or customer for a tip, yet alone, do it twice! So out of kindness, which I shouldn't have left anything by this point. I left a nice tip for the cost of what food I did  have to pay for.  Bottom line, the food was good for the price, but the service from this one person as I don't know how the rest of the servers are. Was just horrible.",

    "text": "I really don't know why I bother with chain restaurants anymore.  Now that my palate has matured and I no longer think chicken fingers and french fries are gourmet cuisine, I really can't find anything to eat in a place like this.    My husband and I were running errands at the Waterfront, and we needed to find a place for lunch.  We decided on Uno because pizza sounded good to us.  My husband is a meat lover, so I agreed to let him order us a meat-covered pizza.  To counteract this a little, I ordered a tomato mozzarella salad, so we'd at least have some vegetables in the mix.    When the salad arrived, it did NOT look like the picture.  The menu description is thus: \"chopped lettuce, roma tomatoes with basil and garlic, buffalo mozzarella, drizzled with balsamic syrup.\"  This description is accompanied by a bright, colorful picture of a salad with bright green lettuce, bright red tomatoes, and a delicate \"drizzling\" of balsamic syrup.  It looks light and yummy.  What we got, however, was soggy yellow and white iceberg lettuce, COMPLETELY DRENCHED in dressing, a total of four tiny pieces of tomato, and some cheese.  It was DISGUSTING.  There was so much dressing dripping off of this dish, it was more like a soup than a salad.  I suspect that the lettuce was so wilted and brown, they figured they could disguise it by completely soaking it in dressing.  Not only was it disgusting, but it cost us about $10.  $10 for complete inedible slop.    The \"numero uno\" pizza we got was nothing to write home about either.  It was ok... very mediocre.  The crust tasted like it was undercooked, and the sauce tasted like plain tomato sauce with no seasoning whatsoever.  I have been to Chicago many times, had real Chicago deep dish many times, and this just doesn't even come close to the real thing.    The ONLY positive I give this restaurant is they have the kiosk in the front where you can look up the calorie count of the food right there.  It would be better if they'd actually print it on the menu, but they are still doing better than most restaurants in this effort.  They are making strides, too, with their whole grain crust options.  I'm sure there's still a lot of room for improvement, however.  If you're listening, Uno, please work on providing your customers with healthier food - not just healthy options like salads, but work on making the main dishes you serve better for your customers (low-fat cheese, low-sugar sauce, less sodium, etc.).   Their hearts will applaud you.    And lastly, why does every chain restaurant have to decorate with old signs?  Is there some sort of chain restaurant decorating requirement I don't know about?  It's baffling.",

First, the crust tastes like a biscuit, and biscuits belong nowhere near or on a pizza. I will give UNOs a thumbs up on it's flatbread, it's better pizza than some pizzerias In the area. When I look over uno's menu almost nothing excites me, this place is a dud. Guess what? Chicagoans don't know how to eat hot dogs either!",

The mixture of ingredients just sliding down your chin as it bubbles out of your mouth. That being said, I really don't understand why people go to Pizzeria Uno. This chain has done to the deep dish pizza what McDonald's has done to hamburgers, Pizza Hut has done to pan pizza, Dominoes has done to hand tossed pizza, and Taco Bell has done to Tex-Mex; it has made it almost unpalatable. On our menu:  French onion Chicken bites Pizza with pepperoni, hamburger, and romano  Looking past the fact that the service was not the best or the fact that the food came out undercooked and tepid in temperature, the food just was not good. Don't get me wrong, this is not the worst pizza I have ever eaten, but this chain is a perfect example of what happens when something becomes so prescribed, overhandled, and overthought that it no longer resembles the original piece of art that tasted so good.   I really never want to return.",

    "text": "I am glad that Western Pennsylvania has one remaining outlet for the great Chicago-style deep dish pizza offered by Uno, its pioneer.  Dining here brought back memories of an excellent meal I enjoyed in Chicago last month at Uno subsidiary, Pizzeria Due.  The restaurant is attractive and comfortable, and the outdoor seating by the river a delight.  The tables outside, though, are too close and if all are occupied, one can hear every word of what is said at neighboring tables.  The spinach and chicken pizza, appetizers of zucchini chips and spinach and artichoke dip were all delicious, but the zucchini was extremely salty.  Our server was pleasant and attentive, performing many quality checks.  $20.99 is a lot to pay for a pizza, but the deep dish pies are hearty and plenty for two people. $7.75 for a small glass of house wine is excessive.  The $4.99 tariff for the single serving appetizers was fair for the quality and the portion sizes.  The weak link was the young lady who seated us.  She was glum, unfriendly, and without a smile.  Instead of saying \"Enjoy your meal\" when seating customers, she says, \"There you are.\"  How a customer is greeted can set the tone for a meal and this is an important facet of the front of the house operation. At The Cheesecake Factory, the host staff is trained to engage the customer in pleasant conversation while leading the guest to the table. The individual at Uno got us off to a poor start.  A nice touch would be for a manager to provide a quality check and make the diner feel welcome.",

The pizza came and the crust was very dry and not much flavor to it. When we were presented with our check we noticed a charge of $1.99 that we didn't know what it was for.  When we asked what the charge was for they charged us for the games that we played on the console that they gave us while waiting for our dinner. I have never heard of anything like it. I wonder how many people used the games and were charged the fee and paid it without noticing it on the bill considering it was hidden discreetly in the middle of the bill. Then when we were ready to pay the bill with cash. We couldn't get our server to come and take payment. Was very disappointed. It will probably be awhile before I go back if ever.",

We looked over the menu and they have so many great choices. Pizza, pasta, appetizers, seafood, burgers, salads and sandwiches.   After ordering two mango lemonades that were wayyyyy over sweetened we ordered our food. We both are going gluten free which is tough but UNO's gave us a nice selection of dishes to choose from. Plus! They make a thin crust gluten free pizza which taste great. My hubby ordered the mediterrean thin crust because he loves kalamata olives and I ordered the Guac-alicious burger with a Caesar side salad. My salad came out pretty quick which was nice but it had a little too much dressing on it. I didn't complain, it still tasted great.  I'm not into red meat so I tried to order a black bean burger or get chicken instead of beef, but the ran out of black bean and they couldn't get the chicken so i just ordered it anyway. The burger was piled really high with all the toppings including guacamole and it was very creamy but i couldn't get over the taste of the burger because it just didn't have any flavor. Very saddening. I ended up just eating the veggies and discarding the meat. I snacked on some of my hubbies pizza even though it was only a small amount.   We came here twice in one week. The second time we ordered the 9-grain deep dish with mushrooms, parmesan and a garlic white sauce. Was this pizza amazing or what?? I will probably always eat this pizza whenever I come.   Only down side is slow service. It took 20 minutes for our pizza to come out and my hubbies was a little over cooked. He got the numero uno which was ok but mine had way more flavor!!",

The deep dish personal pepperoni pizza wasn't very good -- the sauce tasted bland, the crust tasted oily and a bit overcooked or stale, and there wasn't much flavor to the cheese. I haven't been feeling well and thought it might just be me, but my husband tried it and said the same thing. He also said his chicken parmesan sauce tasted bland.  I feel bad -- it was a little like looking at an old Taylor Swift album you used to love five years ago, except now you realize the songs were sappy and she looked completely different. I used to love Uno, but it's not at all what I remembered it to be.",

    "text": "We woke up late and missed the breakfast hours of our favorite place. We needed to go to the Waterfront for errands so we decided to have lunch there. It was around 11:30 and the restaurant was mostly empty. They say is in the back near the doorway to the kitchen. We were waiting and waiting for our waitress to come. During that time we realized that there was a child's birthday party 2 tables away. There were 3 tables of young boys and a table of parents. They were mostly well behaved but they were LOUD!!  Our waitress finally came and took our orders. While we were waiting for food there was a waitress standing right inside the kitchen door complaining about her day job. She went on and on about how bad it was and how she was looking for a new job. So in one ear I had a complaining waitress and birthday party in the other.  We were about to get up and leave when our food came. I had the Wedge Salad. It was ok but not something I would order again. My husband's salad, Italian Chopped, was better. It had a brightness that my salad lacked. IF I ever went back, and that's a BIG IF, I would order that salad. I had the personal size Chicago pizza. It had huge chunks of tomatoes, sausage, and cheese. For something that took so long to get it should have been hot. It was room temperature. I only ate half. My husband got the ziti with sausage. It was salty. I managed one bite and was done. My husband has a higher tolerance for salt so he was able to eat it. What we came away with from this experience is to leave. Don't try to stay when the experience is that bad. We were throughly disappointed.",

Like so many before it, UNOs is making me leave hungry. It was a salad with Walnuts, Goat Cheese, and Blueberries, and while it was good, there was absolutely no value in this meal. One of these days I will learn to stop eating at big chain restaurants, kind of like not shopping at big box stores.   It's a nice atmosphere and generally crowded and loud. Some would call it fun and I think it is. But, sometimes it's worth a little extra to get what you really want and need in a meal. That's what adds value.   In the future these places will be relegated to the last ditch effort when nothing else is available. Only in a pinch.",

Sure, it isn't a world class dining establishment, but it is decent considering it is a chain.  You should know that going into any chain, really.  It was basically exactly what I expected in terms of food quality and price.  We were greeted immediately upon entering, and while the hostess went to grab menus, another server asked us if we were taken care of.  Service at our table was very attentive and water and other beverages were promptly refilled.  I ordered soup and two appetizers instead of an entree or pizza and the server made sure to ask me about the order in which I would prefer receiving my food.    My fiance ordered a deep dish pizza and we know they take longer to make than other food items.  It was quicker than we thought it would be and he really enjoyed it.  I had the potato skin appetizer.  It reminds me of a \"baked potato pizza\" that I used to enjoy at a local place back in Buffalo.  It was delicious, especially with the addition of a little bit of hot sauce.  Overall, it doesn't even come close to visiting an Uno's in Chicago, but then again, when does a copy every live up to the original?  It won't be a regular location in our  dining rotation, but it is good to know that when we have a craving for deep dish, Uno will do the trick and cost a lot less than a trip to Chicago.",

I've had servers forget it, Ive had servers blame the kitchen, \"oh, so-and-so's working, they always forget the special crust.\"  Every time... There's a problem. Every time. And it's not like I go on the weekends when it's super busy. Usually a late weekday lunch around 2 PM. Today, the server brought me the pizza and announced it as \"tomato and cheese with the nine grain crust.\" I took a few bites and noticed it was probably not the nine grain crust. So when she came to check on me, I asked her if it was, and she looked at it and said she wasn't sure. She went back into the kitchen and came out with an unbaked nine grain crust to show me because the cook had said that whoever made the crusts didn't make them correctly.  So that's all they had to work with that day. Ridiculous!  And the pay at the table kiosk: why am I doing your job for you? Their loyalty cards don't work at the kiosks.  Half the time, gift cards don't work at the kiosks... So why would the server even offer it?  The Manager did come over and apologize for the crust, but by that point I was so irritated because the server had to take my credit card and the loyalty card because the kiosk didn't work and I was ready to leave.",

    "text": "Deep-Dish vs. Thin Crust: A needless ideological war. Both are valid and are equally delectable when done correctly. Having gotten that out into the sphere of discussion in the hopes of diffusing the silly, stylistic hostilities, I'll have to admit to not eating much in the way of deep-dish pizzas in my time simply due to a lack of exposure. Face it, kids. We're in Pittsburgh and not Chi-Town. That's not a slight against Pittsburgh's doughy pies, which have a right to exist and do so respectably and deliciously. Nonetheless, I could use more deep-dish dining experience.   Ever since feasting (beasting?) on a deep-dish, torte-like masterpiece at Juliano's in McKees Rocks a few years ago, I'd been craving that manner of pizza. A segment on a Food Network program about Chicago's famed Uno further billowed the flames. A trip to the Waterfront for shopping purposes led us to One! A singular sensation! Cue the dancers!  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMOhpkxi-lOc&s=72c9ac5630bd52227ed820070c103084b9cd3c43da760e46b6914a63bcceb238\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=MOhp...</a>  I don't do musicals.   Maranda, our gracious waitress, brought to us an oven-demon of our own conception.  We doubled up on the goat cheese and added sausage to a pizza  within a pan that resembled a circular fortress of cast iron. Maranda would make the first cut, a mozzarella/romano blend would stretch like protoplasm, forming gossamer strands of milky, lardy, lusty desire.   The sausage came in juicy, deformed gobs. The sauce was chunky, gory, and malevolently robust like a dark, vampiric lord. The crust, which had a taste and mouthfeel somewhere betwixt an animal cracker and Brioche, was scrumptious enough to eat by itself. No chain pizzeria, despite its admirable pedigree and historical weight, has a right to be serving up such brilliant, compelling evil.   If these pies are pre-made or processed or whatnot, then Uno's is being guided by unseen forces that are not to be tampered with by foolish mortals.   Eschewing Uno's other warm, ice cream-topped desserts, one of which involves a large peanut butter cup (!), I decided to stick with a classic in the Uno Deep Dish Sundae. Akin to the late Gullifty's Killer Kookie For Two, an oversized chocolate chip cookie is baked to order in a seasoned, blackened pan and is garnished with the usual creamery accoutrements in hot chocolate sauce and vanilla. The key to chocolate chip cookies I've found is salt, and it propelled the igneous, decadence-studded devil disc into anti-cosmic orbit. The ice cream and whipped cream kept the colossal cookie from being overly indulgent by cutting the sweetness and richness down a few meters. These types of sundaes are commonplace (Uno's offers up a brownie version as well, of course), but they are so only because they are magnificent when made properly, and Uno's is almost definitive.   My deducted star is not due to prejudice against chains but for the avocado eggrolls we had as an appetizer. We didn't need 'em. Maranda said they'll be taken off the menu soon, and it was easy to taste why as they were lifeless packets of sour, hot guacamole. Dismissed. No, a crisp, fresh, tasty, already ranch-dressed (just enough I might add) salad, the pizza (which we didn't finish, taking the remainder home), and a shared dessert were plenty of dinner for Kay and I.   If this is a taste of The Windy City, then I'm runnin' late for the next train. So long...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DMkwYL2BKdfI&s=45e5a6211946dd27ab79e02ff6c00612f762a70665c821d174b184d54c81f905\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=MkwY...</a>  P.S. Hardly tacky, I rather fancied the decor and lively, fun, cordial, happy-hour climate of Uno's. The service was honestly superlative to boot, and aside from the appetizer, everything was impeccably prepared. Fast food this wasn't. Give your snobbery and regional biases (what is a 'real pizza' anyway?) the night off and enjoy yourself here.",

    "text": "For an upscale chain, Uno actually left a decent impression on me. It's certainly much better than say Applebees. The prices are a bit high, although they seem to have all sorts of different daily or late night specials all the time. For our part, we came here because we got a random $10 gift card in the mail.  The menu was pretty extensive, and it was difficult to narrow down our choices to anything. In the end we chose to go with their nominal Numero Uno deep dish pizza, along with the Chicken Spinocolli pasta. Our waitress tried to ask us to order more, though she wasn't overly pushy. The food was pretty good. I was surprised at how filling the deep dish pizza was, despite its deceivingly small size. The individual portion was definitely enough for one. The pasta came with a stuffed chicken breast full of cheese, sauce, and vegetables. All the while I was eating it, I felt guilty for my arteries but enjoyed it so much.  I'd probably deduct a star because of the lack of service we got after the food arrived. Our waitress checked on us once, but it was quite a while between us finishing and her bringing over the check. It was near closing time so there weren't as many people around, but she was nowhere to be seen. Maybe it was just a bad night.  I will probably make a note to try the steak and/or flat breads next time. But overall an okay place.",

After searching for a reasonably priced place that both my 5 year old & her friends, as well as my friends & family, could enjoy themselves we decided on Unos. We had the entire patio to ourselves & our server Melissa could not have been more on point, attending to all of our needs whenever they arose. The kids had a blast making their own pizzas & sundaes & the adults enjoyed the fact that they could go in & catch a few minutes of the steelers game at the bar. I was able to sit back & actually enjoy the party instead of running around serving food & cleaning up. Overall, I cannot say enough good things about Uno & our fantastic server Melissa. Thank you all for making my daughters 5th birthday a total success!!!",

We went there for the first time for some deep dish pizza and were expecting a Chicago deep dish pizza experience but oh boy, little did we know what we were in for!   So after watching a nice movie we went there for dinner and added a deep pan pizza with our favorite toppings! What we got was shameful! Our pizza was out fairly quickly to our surprise but just after taking one looking at it we could tell that it was made some time earlier that morning!!!!!! The pan was not even hot or mildly warm! We called the waiter right away and told him that the pizza was ice cold and the least we expect is freshly made food! He wasn't too happy that had to do extra work but he took the pizza back into the kitchen for a new one.   You guys will not believe what we got after that!!! Some 20mins later we were served the same pizza which was BURNT!!! I kid you not literally BURNT ( ALL THE TOPPINGS WERE CHARRED) we could not believe our eyes and the people running that place! Firstly the chef did that on purpose cuz only a blind person would serve someone that!! I guess he got offended that his customers asked for fresh food cuz that's an offense at this place! Secondly the waiter had some balls to serve us that black charred pizza!!! I mean was he blindfolded too!!! My husband and I looked at the pizza and we asked for the cheque! Glad they did not make us pay for that s***!! I guess the waiter did feel a little embarrassed at the end but god only knows how that place is still running! We left that place hungry and ended up getting McDonalds! So watch out for this place!",

It did come with sweet potato fries and delicious onion rings.  I ordered the nine grain Farmers Market individual deep dish pizza. It was dry which detracted significantly from a good flavor. I've been to the other UNO pizzeria in the area and I loved my pizza but I had a normal crust so maybe that was a factor.   Overall, service was good. Food okay.",

I just chalked that up to our group being so large. The margarita was okay, it wasn't worth the money in my opinion. The food came out in a timely manner and my flatbread was made just right. Hot and crisp with a generous amount of toppings. I'd like to try other things on the menu. Everyone at our table seemed to enjoy what they got and no one had any complaints.",

The kids menu has an make your own pizza option, which is always a fun activity for them. They also have a choice of a personal pizza(not a make your own), Mac and cheese, tiny Dino chx nuggets, kids sliders, and hot dog, and more. They also had a good choice of sides for them as well. Fries, grapes, broccoli, a side salad, and rice.    The lunch menu is what we ordered from today, which is a must when you go for lunch. They have a pick 2 menu with 3 pick options. $6.99 you can get a choice of endless soup bar with 4 different soups, and a choice of salads. $7.99 you get a choice of endless soup bar and either a pizza of the day or sandwich or a salad. And the 8.99 choices(I didn't make it that far on the menu for choices), I think it was a choice of salad and a choice of either pizza or pasta dish?     The kids personal pizza was about 8 inches and filling. The Mac and cheese was also big and had a side of a breadstick. Both choices were good portion sizes to fill my lil ones bellies.     The honey crisp chicken salad was a dinner size(it was big), with lettuce, tomato, red bell pep, onion, cheddar cheese, little crisps, and crispy chicken tenders, topped with a honey mustard dressing. It was a big portion and very delish. The 2nd choice was a personal deep dish pizza. Very good.    The soup bar today had minestrone, clam chowder, broccoli and cheddar, and tomato. All the soups at the bar were served warm and very tasteful. And the fact that they had tobasco at the bar, won my heart. The second lunch choice was a flat bread prosciutto and arugula. The flat bread was brushed with a garlic and oil, with mozzarella, then the prosciutto and arugula, red bell peppers and topped with a balsamic glaze! It was the regular dinner size and so yum for half the cost!     The amount of food they serve you for the lunch specials is beyond my understanding. I just don't know how they do it. The food was very good and the service was very good as well. This is a definite return choice for lunch again soon. Very pleased!",

The roasted eggplant, spinach, and feta flatbread also tasted fresh, which surprised me considering the short wait of 5 minutes or so. The entire dish was layered with thick slices of tomato, and I liked actually being able to taste the eggplant. The pesto sauce was prominent without overpowering the other elements of the dish. Well worth the $12 Pick and Choose price IMO. I did find a curly, black, and fine strand of hair at the side of the salad plate, so a small star off for that.  I had a coupon for a free dessert,  so I asked for the mini chocolate peanut butter cup. It was good but not memorable. I liked that there were mini chocolate chip with the peanut butter though. I'm not sure if the outer chocolate was intended to be rock hard or if the cold ice cream on it had simply hardened it, but it was extremely difficult to cut through with a mere spoon. For a free dessert, it satisfied me though.   The server, Christy B, was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal as well!",

My only encounter with my beloved Uno was when my mother came home with a take out box that she ordered for lunch that day.  I would scarf down the thick wedges of pizza and greedily pick off the loose toppings from the box. The cold 4 hour old pizza has since plagued my mind.  I desperately tried to find an Uno but found that the nearest one had closed down. CLOSED DOWN. My dreams were crushed, my psyche disturbed. I had become a changed person. I wanted more. I needed more. My mother stopped coming home with Uno take out boxes. I stopped eating pizza. I hated the flimsy crusts that were just cheap variants from my beloved Uno, I despised the New york style that you could so easily fold. Feh, I would resign from eating pizza till I had my precious. My precious, my Uno deep dish.   It wasn't until that fated day when I drove past an Uno. The neon lights called out to me, it was like seeing heaven for the first time. I stumbled into the Uno. Dazed, the smell was like nothing I had ever experienced on this green Earth.  There was nothing I could compare it too. I sat down and ordered the Numero Uno with a side of fries.  \"No not personal...Regular.\" I wanted the entire thing, not just a wedge of a dream. I wanted the whole thing.   It came out, steaming. Bubbling. Oozing. Fresh. So fresh. I took a bite - the cheese was perfectly melted. And then another - the dough was so thick and tasteful. And then another - ooh that sausage... Until there was nothing left.   I had achieved my dream. But I will be back for more. I will be back..for my precious.   But the fries were mediocre.",

Only complaint, the bar was loud and when they did blended drinks you had to pause your conversation because the blenders were so loud. Good news, only happened twice!  The four of us decided to order two pizzas, the Pepperoni and the Farmers Market. I also ordered a Caesar salad because I needed more vegetables in my life.    The salad. It was a big salad that I shared with my boyfriend. The croutons were huge and very crunchy. The Caesar dressing was not creamy, it was vinegar based and had a little bit of a \"bite\" to it as Chris kept on saying. I thought the bite had more to do with the vinegar than anything spicy, but who am I to say.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy and they even added tomatoes like I requested.   The main dishes came out about 10 minutes later. I do not know what I was expecting but the pizzas were not as large as I was imagining. Two of the larger pizzas looked like personal pizzas to me. But!!!! I was soon to see that even if they are a bit smaller they were filled to perfection.   The Farmers Market pizza had caramelized onions, spinach, SUN DRIED AMAZING TOMATOES, regular tomatoes, eggplant, pesto as a sauce, and a blend of cheeses. The crust was perfection being so crisp and light that I stole Chris' extra from his plate. The sun dried tomatoes were great adding just enough sweetness to the pizza that I went looking for the slices with the most on them. It was a really really good pizza. We even ended up taking slices home with us! My eyes deceived me at first with the size!   Then our friends told us that we had to try the cookie pizza. Cookie pizza? What sorcery is this? Matt, the one who suggested it said that we would not be disappointed. This cookie came out in a really large, bigger than our pizzas, dish. It had three scoops of icecream on it with a pile of whipped cream. WARM, right out of the oven, fresh cookie pizza. Oh sweet heavens, it was good. I am glad that I had enough room in my stomach to pile in that sweet goodness.   Chicago Pizza, I would absolutly try again.",

And this location has the same look and feel as the old pizza hut before it went take out.   So this is the old style pizza hut.   Very family orientated dining style. You can sit here for hours. And so we did. We had a heap of use in a long table.  I ordered one of the small pizzas which were buy 1 get one free. Disappointed in the selection of that. Seeing other choices... I regretted going on the cheap.   Prices are moderate. 12 for a little pizza... but with all the dough, you get full. Can't say I walked away hungary. Nor did I finish my second mini pizza.   I want to come back and get that spanich fetta looking pizza!",

    "text": "My friend and I have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. For a Thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. There were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. We ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken, hamburger and pepperoni (for him) while the other side had just pepperoni (for me). I was expecting the pizza to be bland and warm but it was surprisingly hot and savory. I even tried a slice of my friend's pizza and the hamburger and chicken were moist, not dried out. This wasn't bad for a first visit so I will definitely be back in the future to try more menu items. I'm only giving Uno 4 stars because the waitress brought us a plate that still had old food stuck to it. Hello! The plate was yellow! How could she not have seen that?!",

We arrived at 5:30 thinking it was plenty of time since the event started at 6 and mickey and minnie were supposed to come out at 6:30. Nope. We still waited an hour for a table. Everyone that was seated was done with their food but they didn't want to get up until the characters came out. Perhaps in the future you should have a waiting area for the folks that are finished?  Second complaint the seating. There seemed to be no rhyme or reason to the hostesses seating people. Yes they had a list but I'm fairly confident they stopped using it. I saw several families get seated that came in after us. I started to think that they lost the list and then whoever complained they just seated them. I tested my theory and well...i was right. All i did was ask the hostess where my name was on the list. She didn't even ask my name and immediately seated my family and I. Wow! Very disorganized and inefficient way to run a restaurant event.  When we did get seated, ordered and ate, the pizza was pretty good. We got the farmers choice i believe it was called. It had eggplant and tomatoes on it. It was tasty.  If my daughter didn't have such a good time with the music and watching other kids I would have left here pretty mad. In the end we were there for 2 hours and we didn't even wait in line for mickey and minnie. I really truly hope the hostesses don't run the seating situation like that daily. You won't see me back here for an event. Zero stars for efficiency during an event and three stars for the pizza.",

However, it is nowhere near what you will get if you go to the Uno's in Chicago or a similar place in the city.  My favorite thing about the deep dish pizza in Chicago is how fresh the dough and ingredients are.  At the Uno's in Pittsburgh however you don't really get that.  The dough did not taste house made and the sauce tasted like it was canned.  The pizza also fell apart very easily.  For someone who loves True Chicago deep dish, this place was a major disappointment.",

DISCLAIMER:  This is NOT full-on, proper, Chicago-deep-dish pizza.  I have been to the original in Chicago, as well as to Lou Malnati's, Gino's East, and Giordano's, many times, over the years.  If you want real Chicago pie, you will be disappointed with Uno's \"deep dish\" product.  That said, it's still really good in its own right.  It is pricey, but it is pretty thick and will fill you up, so you will not eat as much as you think (so is it really expensive?).  Service is pretty good, the restaurant is large and accommodates big families and groups well.  The side-salads are fresh and good.  They have lots of easy parking.  So overall, it's good, and fit's Yelp's description of 3-stars:  \"A-OK.\"",

When we walked in,  the hostess greeted us with a smile and a friendly \"hello\", asking us how many, getting a name and letting us know it would be about 10 minutes.   We were sat at a table within 10 minutes and our server,  Amy,  appeared within a minute with a smile, introducing herself, asking us how we were, and taking our drink orders. Our drinks (water, iced tea, and a lemonade) were brought back promptly and we ordered an appetizer.   As we studied the huge menu, we flipped back and forth through the pages & finally decided on two entrees each,  which would be narrowed down to one each as Amy answered our questions about each.  Immediately after we ordered our entrees, Amy came over with 'bad news'.... that they were out of the appetizer we had ordered.... No biggie to us,  as we understand! She brought over a menu so we could pick a different app & took the order promptly. They came out quickly and were delicious!  (Oh!  We ended up getting the Zucchini)   Our food came out in a timely manner. Amy brought us refills,  a ramekin of ranch, and a box (because looking at my meal,  I knew I was going to need it). We enjoyed every bite of our meals. Amy checked on us a couple of times, ensuring things were wonderful.   The prices for what we got were great. The food was fantastic. The service was wonderful! We will certainly go back next time we are at the Waterfront and we will ask for Amy's section, in hopes that she will be there!",

However, don't be fooled, they serve up much more than pizza and sometimes, it's nice to have that variety when you're coming with a large party and when not everyone wants pizza.   I like the versatility here with the varied menu. Sometimes, I don't even come here for the pizza. While the pizza is definitely the star of the show, their steak is also pretty tasty as are the sandwiches.   The food is enjoyable but the main reason why this is a go-to for me and my friends is because the service is usually very quick here. There rarely is a wait and the wait staff get us in and out right in time to make it to a movie. With food being rather consistent, it's hard to go anywhere else and chance the long wait times.",
