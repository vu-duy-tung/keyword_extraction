I will never be ordering from them again, which is a shame since they are so close to me. I immediately called Pizza Parma which gladly delivered to me. I recommend ordering from Pizza Parma since they have similar menu items, they post accurate hours, and they don't hang up on you! Seriously? Why answer the phone?",

I ordered the Milano special pizza, which had pepperoni, bacon, sausage, bell peppers, mushrooms, olives, tomatoes, etc, and the popcorn chicken. The order itself arrived within thirty minutes which was great. Although the pizza tasted decent, the crust was not crispy at all, the slices were pretty floppy. They also skimped on the toppings a bit. I was hoping for a more loaded pizza. I'm not watching my weight--I can handle it. As far as the popcorn chicken goes, it was too salty, even with the honey Dijon dipping sauce. Probably not ordering from here again.",

But my friend had a half finished piece of Greco just sitting there on the table waiting for me to finish it. It was as if the pizza told me to pick it up and keep nibbling and nibbling .

The order from the eatstreet app (1 medium pizza, half cheese half pepperoni) was not what we got. We got full pepperoni, and the receipt from Perfectta did not match the receipt from eatstreet, which has never happened to me before. It also meant that the person who didn't want pepperoni had to pick it all off. We would have complained and asked for a plain small to compensate but we didn't have an extra hour to wait.   The pizza was cold (unsurprisingly - I called in and was told the driver had taken over 15 minutes in transit because Polish Hill is apparently not close to Shadyside...? I can walk to Pizza Perfectta in a half hour.) and the flavor was merely okay. Will not order again.",

I had noticed this pizza place before and had wanted to try it but never really had the chance before today.  Inside it looked like your normal pizzeria with a counter to order from, a pop cooler, a display dessert case and a pinball machine which was sadly not on. The temperature inside was pleasant as the air conditioner was set to 66 which was a good change from the stickiness outside.  We were greeted almost immediately on entering and I ordered a plain slice.  A few minutes later we were on our way with my slice of pizza.  I was happy to feel that the box was actually hot and so the slice was properly warmed.  Upon opening it I was also pleased to see that the slice was pretty large.  The pizza itself ended up being really solid.  On it there was a good covering of good tasting cheese which did not fall off the pizza when eating.  The crust was crispy and of medium thickness which meant the slice wasn't floppy.  Finally my favorite part was the sauce which had some good flavor to it.  As a matter of a fact you could see the spices when looking at it closely.  The bottom line for me is that I would eat here again in the future.  I liked the pizza that I had here and may even order a whole one in the future.",

They also have a traditional pizza place menu with salads, hoagies, breadsticks, pastas, and munchies. The cheesesticks are great when you're craving something cheesy and salty, and their grilled chicken salad with fries and ranch dressing is dependable as well.   One great thing about this place is that you can stop in and grab a slice or two if you're in a hurry. This place is right along my way home from the bus from work, so I'm always tempted to stop here.  If you're looking for a great place to grab an inexpensive pizza, check out Pizza Perfectta!",

They are very generous with toppings, which taste wonderful, and the general cheese-sauce-toppings ratio of the pizza is very even. However, my favorite part of the pizza is the sauce. I believe that a good, flavorful sauce can make even the most basic pizza sing. The sauce that Pizza Perfectta used for their pizza had enough of a kick so that it brought out the cheese and other flavors of my pizza (mushrooms, onions, and sausage).  When I ordered my pizza from them, they were ridiculously fast about getting it ready and it only took 15 minutes for me to wait to get my pizza from them. I'm sure with delivery it might take longer for your food to be ready but if you pick up your pizza from them instead, it's super quick! Pizza Perfectta is definitely my favorite pizza place in Shadyside and I am so lucky to live close by!!",

    "text": "Early last week, with an 18 pound ham in tow (the company I work for gives them out each December as 'tokens of esteem'), I wasn't about to bus it home. Kay, my chauffeur, my savior, my girlfriend rescued me from a rainy, strenuous trip from Lawrenceville to Beechview. But...what to do for dinner?  Pizza: The god in the machine of dinnertime difficulties.   I'd been hearing and reading positive anecdotes regarding this satellite of the local Pizza Milano franchise for the past year, so after plugging the name of the business into the GPS, we were on our way to gilded, bohemian Shadyside.   After tearing into the medium-sized pizza we requested, we found that it was very similar to other Pittsburgh pies in that it was rather doughy and held much cheese as well as a citrusy sauce, but where it protruded slightly amongst the throngs was the crust itself.  Imagine an oven-blackened sourdough bread topped with mozzarella, crushed, stewed tomatoes, bacon, and olives. Imagine further, pure baked ecstasy.   Also bought, shared, and gobbled was a nonpareil tuna melt hoagie that was heavy on the herbed (uncanned?) tuna salad and cheese which formed strings when the sandwich was pulled from our mouths following each blissful bite.   To my taste nodules and breadbasket, there are superior pizza parlors to be found in our amazing city, but Pizza Perfectta is admirable enough to manage a spot in the top 20% with little effort.   P.S. The service was generous, genial, and wonderful. Just as we paid our tab, Kay squealed in joy after noticing that PP also sells Otis Spunkmeyer cookies.  Even though we insisted on paying for them, the gent who took our order gladly gave us a few for free to take home.   P.P.S. Seating is limited to stools and a counter that surrounds the storefront's window, making for fun people-watching...on a stormy, wet evening. Hipsters are a tougher bunch than I thought. Yeesh!",

I paid the $2.29 extra for a pepperoni topping. Fair amount of cheese & pepperoni on the entire pizza. Crust isn't too crunchy, nor too soft. I got the garlic parm and buffalo sauce ($1 each) for my wings - they put all the wings in garlic parm and gave me a side of buffalo sauce. I'm not sure how that made sense. Also, no ranch or dipping sauce even though it was requested.   Overall, an okay to decent pizza place that delivers. *$1 delivery fee*",

    "text": "Pizza Perfectta bailed my pregnant friend, her husband, and I out a few weeks ago when we were all HANGRY on a Friday night.  Their online ordering system was easy to follow, and we quickly placed an order for a large pepperoni pizza ($12.59 special) for pick-up.  We were quoted a wait time of 15 minutes.  We picked up the pizza at exactly fifteen minutes.  It clearly had been sitting for a bit because it was already cold by the time we got home.  The pizza was just OK.  There was plenty of pepperoni but practically no cheese.  The crust was decent, but it just wasn't a memorable pizza.  The biggest issue here is that there is no close by street parking so it is a big pain to pick up food here.  We probably won't return since parking is such an issue.",

    "text": "They claimed on their website that they have \"the best wings in town\". As a seeker of good wings, let me tell you about my adventure with this place.   Everything started fine with our order of 24 wings with three separate sauces for 3 eaters. The wings arrived exactly an hour later with the exact number of wings promised and a side of celery. Here's the catch...THERE WAS NO SAUCE! My party of three decided to just tough it out and eat the wings plain. They were, I kid you not, so bland that I wasn't sure what I was eating. They literally just threw the wings in the fryer and delivered it to us. So once we realized how unbearable the plain wings were, we called and complained about the sauce. About 40 minutes later, the sauce arrived. At this point, the wings got cold and our hunger turned into an unbearable rage. We tried BBQ, Garlic Parmesan and Spicy. The sauces were just average. The spicy sauce was so weak that I should've just settled with a bottle of sirracha.   The deliver guy gave us a cannoli as an apology....ONE CANNOLI....3 eaters! You get the point. But this gives me the chance to tell you how terrible the cannoli was. The outer shell was soggy and the filling made me gag a little. It looked nice, but didn't taste that great.   So after 1 hour and 40 minutes, 24 wings, 3 sauces and a cannoli... we have 3 very unhappy customers. The wings were the most mediocre wings I have ever tasted. I will NOT order here again for the wings NOR will I recommend it to the fellow wings connoisseurs out there. Final verdict: MOST MEDIOCRE wings in town!",

The Buffalo fries are great as well- and if you top it with cheese you also get the aluminum container. We all know food tastes better when its reheated in the oven.  The Chicken Ranchero Pizza is great, but I feel pretty guilty about eating it, so I just order regular pizza with random toppings that I'm in the mood for. My other favorite item is the Cheesy Breadsticks.  Consistent, delicious quality with reliable delivery=5 stars. I've walked by the store itself- it's a takeout place.",

After ordering pizza at home twice that week (we DID NOT feel like cooking), I decided to go with a grilled chicken salad. Meh. I'm not saying it was bad, but it wasn't really that great either. I thought they could have dressed it up some more. It was loaded with (too much) cheese and it melted due to the fries being warm, making the top of the salad kind of gross. Underneath the melted cheese was the lettuce, tomatoes, onions and cucumber. I guess this is all standard for a salad, but it really just didn't impress me. Plus, I thought the chicken tasted pre-cooked which should be a big no-no for restaurants. One perk, however, was the size as it was pretty big! However, for $8.00, I felt it was a little steep.   I also had a slice of pizza (I can't resist pizza) and it was comparable to any other pizza shop.   Service is very good, though! I placed the order and the employee I spoke with was very friendly. They had it delivered in time as well.   I'm not complaining because it was a free lunch, but I would never order myself.",

Overall, I found their pies typical of PGH pizza in style, and slightly above average in quality, hence the 4 star rating (my average rating, as well as the PGH Yelp citywide average, is 3.5).  Jason F. describes the elements of the pizza well, so I won't reiterate them.  I will mention that there was a generous amount of cheese, and the sauce:cheese ratio was on point.  I don't recall the crust being particularly crisp (my personal sticking point when it comes to pizza); however, on the other hand, I don't recall it being floppy or insubstantial, either.  In terms of overall quality, Pizza Perfectta's pies are a cut above those of nearby Pizza Parma, and they offer similar conveniences (acceptance of credit cards; delivery).  Given that I don't order food for delivery, I'll stop by in person the next time I'm in the vicinity of Shadyside/East Liberty.",

Well done, a good flavorful sauce, and just the right amount of crust. While they have good pizza, I usually find myself sticking to the hoagies, which are some of the best in town. They're loaded well and toasted to perfection. I highly recommend the steak and mushroom, as well as the chicken parm. Very filling, and the whole ones often serve for two meals for me. The wings I've had were good, too. Nice and meaty, and just the right amount of sloppy.   Prices are on par with most Pittsburgh pizza shops, and I'd highly recommend checking out the online coupons on their site. Pizza Perfectta is fast, delicious, and a great value.

PLUS it was $4.99!! I expected a healthy portion for that price. I will not be ordering from this location again.",

Not to mention you could tell he was getting frustrated because he kept having to re ask the questions I already told him. Here's a thought, maybe someone that speaks better english should answer the phone? I ordered 12 wings, asked for them crispy because I absolutely hate gummy wings and a mini pizza with mushrooms. The wings were gross, completely gummy, even though I stressed when I ordered to please make sure they were crispy. The pizza was completely mediocre at best, definitely nothing special and definitely not that good either. Lastly, when I called they said delivery would be 30-40 mins... I waited over an hour and 15 mins to receive my food. Definitely will not ever buy from this place again, spend your money somewhere else.",

This should be my go-to pizza destination but I'd rather pay a delivery charge than eat their pizza. The sauce is way too sweet (like, Papa Johns sweet) and there isn't enough cheese. There are too many decent pizza delivery places around to settle for this. The only thing I enjoy about Pizza Perfectta is that their sign hilariously claims, \"Excitingly flavored!\" Personally, I wasn't having an orgasm over my mediocre pizza. Maybe if they wouldn't have tempted me with such language I would be less pissed off at them. Two stars only because they let me borrow some paper cups when I moved into my apartment and hadn't unpacked my kitchen stuff yet. Without them I may have had to travel half a block north and grab some from a different restaurant. Thanks, Pizza Perfectta.  Oh, and here's a little Italian lesson for you: it's \"perfetta,\" not \"perfectta.\"",

Coming from the NY/NJ area which is pizza and Italian food heaven, you can say I'm picky when it comes to my pizza and I often find it difficult to find good pizza outside of the area where I live, but Pizza Perfectta totally delivers with great taste every time.  The sandwiches and side orders I've tried have all been great as well.

One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than True NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.  The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites: Fiori's Pizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch) Pizza Perfectta Aiello's (Murray Street) Beto's  Save for Beto's, I thought they were all delicious.  Wish I had a chance to try Mineo's.  A Pittsburgh native friend of mine calls this his favorite but they were closed July 5th when I went by their place on Murray... I'll try them next time I'm in the 'burgh.  Pizza Perfectta has a few stools and a counter but really it is a take-out place.",
