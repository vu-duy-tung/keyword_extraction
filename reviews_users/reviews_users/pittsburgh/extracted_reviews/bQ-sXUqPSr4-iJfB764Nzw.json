I had a burger which also had no flavor, apart from grease. Cooked as requested, but when it's a pre-made burger, that's really all that's left to mess up.   When the bill came, I found that we had also been charged for fries, which had presumably been included with the burger. NOPE. If I'm paying $16 for a burger and fries, I'd like to be somewhat impressed. This was just incredibly disappointing. We won't be returning.",

We decided to wait at the bar until our table was ready and sat there for 10+ minutes before anyone noticed.  Our food was OK, just a typical chain restaurant burger, certainly not worth of the accolades they claim to have received.

But instead, Marcus turned the tables and took out meals  away stating it was Christmas and because we complained we should get nothing for complaining. Thankfully, he left our children with their meals. My husband and I sat at the table while our kids ate. The incident was totally bizarre. Marcus should NOT have a job in service management. He was an angry, arrogant, somewhat unstable person. THIS WAS RECOGNIZED BY SEVERAL TABLES DINING NEAR US. Because of this, I will never eat here again.

Ordered an appetizer which took 30 minutes to get. Same problem with the entree.  Our waitress took our order and brought our check which was awkward as she never really waited on us. We flagged down other waiters for water and everything else we needed (napkins, silverware and missing items we ordered). No one ever cleared empty plates and glasses during our entire stay.

    "text": "I went here twice because it was in the hotel I was staying in (Westin). I was pretty excited that I had a great bar in the hotel so as to avoid having to drive or walk far.   It's a nice looking restaurant/bar. I sat at the bar so I don't know what the rest of the place looks like. The service here was really good. I didn't have a single problem.   First night I ordered the bacon and cheddar burger with a pretzel bun. I was skeptical of the bun thinking it was some sort of gimmick, but it was really good! The burger, I ordered it medium rare, came out rare, but I'd rather go that way than the other. The only big problem with this burger is that the onion rings I ordered to go on top of it were red onions. Red onions are not sweet, they are very bland and in turn really bring the taste of the burger way down. I like the sweetness of white/yellow onions. These were not that. I couldn't even eat them, they were gross.   The second night I was there I ordered the same thing because it really was a great burger. I asked this time if they could make my burger actually medium rare since it was so rare last time. The bartender recommended I order it medium and then it would come out medium rare (you'd think), but it actually came out medium. Uh. They brought me my new burger out and it was fine, but I was irked by the insistence of the person who brought it to immediately cut into it (which I don't, I eat it as a whole burger) to see if it was okay. That was not okay, the burger was.   I then ordered a dessert that I waffled on. I really wanted the pop tart but then waiter told me it was really small. I then ordered my other choice, the red velvet birthday cake. They should REALLY have a disclaimer that their cake is NOT made in-house. If I want boxed cake I don't need to pay $6 a slice, I can walk to the grocery store and get a whole cake for that. I don't go to restaurants to have boxed dessert, I just don't. This and the onion rings were why it gets this many stars.   The service is excellent, the bartender that waited on me both times was very nice and the food could be great with a few modifications. I won't be back, but it was an okay place to have dinner a couple of times.",

This year I chose Bill's Bar & Burger because the price was affordable for the most people (Only $25.40 for a full Thanksgiving dinner with side dishes, dessert, soft drinks, tea, coffee, and tax and gratuity included!), the food was all home-made in house, and the restaurant is centrally located. Tiffany Welsh, the Special Events Manager, was a joy to work with and answered all of my questions in a timely manner. The day of the event, the staff provided my group with excellent service, and the turkey dinner, side dishes, and pumpkin pie were the best I've had in any restaurant on Thanksgiving day!   It's a lot of extra work to write separate checks for such a large group, but Bill's Bar & Burger went above and beyond the call of duty to accommodate my people. We all got our food and drinks really quickly, and the food was delicious. And you could tell everything was home made with quality ingredients.  After dinner, we enjoyed spending time in the lounge area near the bar where there is a sofa and comfy chairs for customers to relax and hang out while enjoying after-dinner drinks and conversation. It was a really fun event, and Bill's Bar & Burger really hit it out of the park! They took care of my group with top notch customer service AND really delicious food! THANK YOU FOR A GREAT TIME! We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I need to write this review while it is still fresh in my mind, otherwise I am sure I will let something out.  I recently stayed downtown and due to the fact that the hotel I was staying at didn't have a restaurant in it I needed to find food elsewhere.  Yes, I know this is part of a hotel itself, but I did not stay at the Westin.  I was looking for a place that had later hours due to the fact that I was going to have a late dinner.  This place fit that bill on that fact alone, but I probably should have looked elsewhere.    When I had shown up I had all intentions to sit at the bar to dine, but once I entered I decided differently.  After a rather sad sports day in the city the bar was lined with some long faces and drunken attitudes.  After the host had a lengthy conversation with a coworker I was finally noticed at the host stand.  When I told the host that it was only me and he suggested that I sit at the bar, I deferred that notion and requested a table.  Once seated at the table, it wasn't any better.  Those drunken attitudes seem to have spread out through the restaurant.  To say the noise level was loud is close to an exaggeration.  If I had to hear the drunk lady tell her daughter and son-in-law how much she was ready for a baby any longer I may have offered to help that process along just to get her to shut up.  Once I had a chance to look over the menu I was a little confused.  Everything is priced extra.  That is unless you get the platter deal.  The burger by itself is not on the cheap, ranging from $8-$11.  The sides start at $3 and range up to $6.  So if you were to go on the complete cheap side of things here, your meal before anything else is already at $11.  They do say that you can make your burger a platter, but it is basically the same pricing.  I went with Big Bill's Deluxe Platter.  At $13, it is probably the best value.  The burger patty is bigger, but that didn't make up for the lack of spices.  There was no taste to this thing at all.  And let's touch on the grease issue.  Or should I say let the grease issue touch on you.  There was so much burger grease that the bottom half of the bun was saturated and nearly inedible.  The fries, cold.  However the fries did have a decent seasoning on them.  I really need to touch on the customer service before I end this review.  My server, or maybe I should say order taker because he did not serve a single item to me, was so scarce for me that he might as well had been a ghost.  After my order was taken he only came back to give me my check.  The guy that actually served my food was the most pleasant person I had an interaction with the whole time here.  After finishing my food and drink, I waited for twenty minutes.  In those twenty minutes I watched my \"server\" whiz by multiple times.  I even attempted to wave him down so I could get my check and go.  I'm not sure how he missed me on all those occasions, especially when he stopped at the table next to me to hand them their checks.  People seated after me were already gone and here I still sat.  Finally I received my check and was eager to pay and leave.  I will never stop back here again, this visit has left a less than desired taste in my mouth, figuratively and literally.",

We ordered the turkey burger and it was full of what looked like strings, when we asked what they were I was told it was mushrooms.  I am a foodie so I initially wondered if it was saffron, nope... Looked up all kinds of mushrooms to figure out what this was and I cannot find anything that looks like this. :-(   The sweet potato fries were great!!  If you come here, please don't get the turkey burger..",

Salad was good. Burger was one of the better ones that I had. Food price for these items seemed reasonable to me given their quality.   However, I was disappointed in the cherry pop tart. It was $9.  Given that price, I would have expected a desert with premium ingredients. Instead, the ice cream that came with it seemed to be of lower grade and I would have expected real cherry filling - not some synthetic goo.   Overall, it was a good restaurant to go to in a pinch but it cannot compete on the level and experience of Burgatory.",

The girlfriend ordered one of their cocktails and it took forever. The guy couldn't find the ingredients or tools needed to make the drink. This wasn't a rare obscure drink, it was one of their advertised drinks on the black board above the bar. To top it off, he was coughing the entire time he was making the drinks. Just truly gross.   As for my drink, I asked what type of beer the Troegs is and he didn't know. He poured way too much beer and it was a mess to even pick up the mug. This experience was so bad we actually had to laugh about it.",

    "text": "Although I usually look for locally owned, mom and pop kind of establishments when I choose a place for dinning, I was very intrigued to try Bill's Bar & Burger that is on CNN's list of the top 10 best burgers in America.  The place just recently opened in the Westin Convention Center replacing the Original Fish Market, which closed last November.   First off, the place is huge!  I made the mistake of thinking that I could enter it from the outside. I ended up walking the length of the Westin entering the hotel on the east side only to have to walk the entire length of the hotel again to find the entrance. Do yourself a favor if you come here and simply enter the hotel off of the main entrance on Tenth Street. The entrance to the restaurant is right there on your right. Inside you get the feeling of spaciousness. I was left to wonder if they will ever fill all of these seats.  In addition to traditional seated dining, there is a full bar with an impressive beer list and, I suppose as a reminiscence to its predecessor, an eight seat sushi bar.   I passed on the sushi in favor of its namesake; a burger and took a seat at the bar. The bartender, Becky, pleasantly greeted me, offered me a menu and gave me a moment to look it over. Wanting to try something unique I went with the Fat Cat Burger and included fries and an ice tea with it. It took only 10 minutes for my burger to arrive. It was two greasy patties with melted American cheese topped with a mound of caramelized onions and butter served on a toasted English muffin. The fries came in a wire basket. Wake up arteries!!!   No doubt the burger was yummy. Greasy as all getup but what would you expect? The fries were average at best with most of them being \"fry fragments\" (if you know what I mean), hardly worth $4.00. The entire bill for a burger, fries and ice tea before tip came to $18.14.   The service was exceptional, the atmosphere was pleasant and clean but in agreement with Maurice W. and Dave M. who provided previous reviews here, $18.00 for a greasy burger, fries and a drink is way overpriced for the Pittsburgh market. Especially when you consider all of the options in the Cultural District which offer quality meals for less. I say, bring back the Original Fish Market.",

    "text": "Wah!  This is my second time visiting. The first time I arrived for happy hour the week prior. The bar service was so slow. I had to give the bartender the evil eye before I could get a drink after staring at the two bartenders for 15 minutes. I had a mojito since it was a happy hour special (still $8), but it was good. A little more lime-juicy than a normal mojito, but I liked it.   The next time- I came for lunch with co-workers on a Wednesday (I figured I would give it another shot). My one co worker made a reservation for us at 12pm. I was impressed that we were seated right away considering the crowd, and that we were a few minutes late.   The interior of the restaurant is nice- It's also a lot bigger than it looks from the outside.  We were seated, and our drink orders were taken quickly. Our water arrived after 15 minutes, and my mojito arrived after 25 minutes. The manager brought my mojito to me, and advised it was on her for the delay. I thought it was a nice gesture- until I tasted the mojito. Too much simple syrup was added, it was horrible and very hard to drink. Not at all like the one I had last time. Couldn't taste any lime at all. I didn't complain any further as it was free. I opted to try their sushi for lunch. The California roll was decent, and made with real crab. The spicy tuna roll had too much sauce and not enough tuna for my taste. My friend tried one of the tuna rolls, and liked it.   My co workers each had burgers and fries. First off, one of the burgers never showed. The one co worker was so hungry after waiting 40 minutes for the food, she started eating hers. She said the burger just tasted like patties from a box (they also looked liked patties from a box). After the second burger arrived, the same manager gave it to the other co worker for free.   To top it all off, my receipt should have showed the sushi since my mojito was free. There was an additional charge of $1.00 for pepper jack cheese that one of my co workers actually got on their burger. At this point, I'm so annoyed I deducted the $1 from the tip.   The waitstaff was very friendly- I feel bad only giving two stars. I'm so disappointed since the restaurant is located in the building I work in downtown. I probably won't be back.",

We had a party of 7 and no one single person received their food at the same time. The orders arrived over a span of 45min. We cancelled two orders because people were just no longer hungry. The longer this went on, the more questions we asked about the orders and the more snarky and pissy the waitress became. After all \"she doesn't know, she doesn't stock the kitchen.\"  Eventually manager removed some things from checks and the order and everyone's remaining bill was reduced 10%.

It's designed as a more upscale \"burger bar\" but the burgers were pretty lackluster. When you're opening up a burger joint in the Burgh, you're competing with places like Burgatory, BRGR, and a lot more trendy spots in our number 1 Zagat rated city. You better bring it.  My burger was super tiny (6 oz, not nearly enough considering I got it with no bun). There was also no option for a double Patty which was sad. It also was nothing spectacular. It was thin and not memorable. My side salad (which cost me 5 bucks) was a handful of lettuce with no toppings.  My husband got the spinach artichoke dip as an app. They gave him a handful of chips and didn't even fill the bowl up with dip. He got the loaded nachos app as an entree and it was loaded... for an infant maybe. Scarce toppings and a small portion for an app that's supposed to be shareable. He said the taste for both was decent but not worth the price or portion.  Overall, we will not be back. Absolutely no point in visiting this spot.",

What a ridiculous preconception; they proved me wrong. The layout is spacious with great ambience as well as a small courtyard style patio. I can't imagine how difficult it is to work in the service industry but you'd never know it with employees here. Customer service levels exceeded my expectations for sure. I like being able to post positive reviews when a team of people work so hard at what they do and genuinely seem to be enjoying themselves. The bar has a great selection of beers and spirits and the food is impeccable. Chef Michael (Chopped winner) rocks! The sliders and breaded jalapeno cheese balls are super yummy. The food was beyond delicious! Simply put, the food, drinks staff and service at Bill's=perfection! I can't wait to get back!",

I have tried every one of their burgers and most shakes and every thing has been delicious. Food comes out quick, hot, juicy and delicious every time! They are also more than willing to customize your meal to your liking.  Managers Marcus and Tony make me feel like celebrity- greeting me with a smile and always making a point to come around several times to make sure everything is OK and to get me anything I need.   Located very conveniently in the Westin downtown, I can get in and out and on my way in no time, or linger over a cold draft and people watch.   Without a doubt Bill's is a little known gem that deserves 5 stars all the way!",

    "text": "Bill's is the most convenient restaurant for those who are staying at the Westin because it's right inside the hotel. Usually, I don't go to hotel restaurants because those have a tendency to be overpriced, but it was a rainy July 4th and I didn't want to walk out to the Strip District so what the hey?  The dining area looked very comfortable and spacious, with two large sections. There's a smaller cafe area out back as well. I'm not sure how and when all those areas are used. For this visit, my friends and I sat at the bar. One look at the menu comfirmed what I knew about hotel restaurants. Everything was premium-priced! However, the Pittsburgher I ordered was easily one of the best burgers I've ever had so perhaps it's worth the cost.  There are a host of minor issues with service though. The server probably expects everyone to open a bar tab. I had to tell her 3 times that I was paying in cash before it sank in. Call me old-fashioned but I don't automatically use a credit card for everything. Secondly, she removed the condiment tray before I was done with it.  In summary, if you enjoy the premium burgers or simply don't want to or can't leave the hotel (like Arkady Balagan in Endgame), I'd say go for it. Otherwise, there are much cheaper options elsewhere.",

    "text": "After walking by on our way home from work wondering when it was going to open, on Friday we realized it was kicking, so we knew we would have to go soon.  Saturday night, we decided to meet a friend there for dinner as we were curious.   I have to say, I am a fan.  We were greeted promptly, our service started and ended great, and the food was pretty good.  I did not expect it to be like some other places that we frequent but when I base this review on other establishments like this, it definitely deserves a 4.  We got the fried pickles and banana peppers with ranch and I think that they were pretty awesome.  We also had Vanilla shakes, a few burgers, regular fries, sweet potato fries and the Steak and Fries (Wagyu steak with a red wine reduction).  The only think I would not get again would be the steak... i will save that for some other places that I go to.  The steak and reduction were good, just not the best that I have ever had and they did several other things better.   The sushi that I had seen looked good, and since the Original Fish Market was one of my favorite sushis in town, and the staff seems a lot the same, I am confident that when I try it, I will not be disappointed.  I regretted not ordering it when I saw it walk past our table a few times.   Prices were fair... $5 for a vanilla shake, $8 for a 6oz burger, the steak and fries was $25 I think.  I think they were in line with the market downtown.    Large beer selection, some good wines to choose from, specialty cocktails... I was pretty impressed.    I had seen someone mention that they could not tell who was staff and who was not.  The staff (less the managers and the host staff) is wearing denim shirts... easy to spot.   The place is huge, and it looks like they have a private area too.  I think this a great addition to the dining scene downtown personally.",

I once had to yell at my dog for trying to eat a cat turd and she wouldn't even touch this rubber chicken burger thing. Also, fries were terrible with literally like 10 strands of parmesan.

    "text": "There is a special place in hell for those eateries that disrespect a burger. Bill's Bar & Burger has earned a seat in that place.   My colleague and I were visiting Pitt on business and staying near the Westin where this establishment is located. We walked in during lunch time and it was nearly empty in the restaurant. They were slow to seat us and even slower to take our order. When a server did come by, he apologized profusely for the delay and proceeded to tell us what was good on the menu. He took off to get our drink orders and the smarmy manager swept in to take our food orders and to drone on about his philosophy on the perfect burger. I was sold on substituting the \"english muffins\" for the standard bun and substituting the fries with the homemade chips. I received his high praise for ordering my burger cooked as rare as possible. \"I wouldn't have any other way, sir\" he muttered.  After more than 45 minutes (and don't forget that this place is empty) we were served our \"food\" along with more profuse apologizing for the delay.   At first glance, the portion size looked really small. I took my first bite and to my dismay (horror) found The patty char-burned and  the two store-bought english muffins not toasted. Really?! I took another bite hoping for the a different outcome. The second bite was worse. And those homemade potato chips were no better -- I think they may have been guitar pics in a former life.  Naturally, I complained to the server and again received more profuse apologizing. He offered to go to the chef and have what remained of the english muffins toasted. I refused (mainly in fear of what they'd do to what was left of my meal) and I told him that I would just pass on the meal altogether. He apologized again said he'd make the smarmy manager aware of the situation. I expected the manager to come right out to apologize and remove the item from our bill. He didn't. In fact, I didn't see the manager again -- as if he vanished. I envisioned him hiding in the kitchen, behind the friolater until we left.  We received the bill and, yes, I was still being charged for that abomination of a meal. All I could do was laugh and leave the scene of the crime with a bit of grace.  If you find yourself in this neck of the woods, avoid this place. I would suggest you visit two truly exceptional eateries: Meat and Potatoes (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmeatandpotatoespgh.com%2F&s=37d1dbc7e728c6ad198cfa24583ca040b08a8dafe5100bd7f319f268482ca354\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">meatandpotatoespgh.com</a>) or Proper (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.properpittsburgh.com&s=79bdcc10f0bcf369f798ad1df27714f3874017b649dfe768281d7bac71a2d96e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">properpittsburgh.com</a>).",

This was only the tip of the proverbial iceberg, as we soon found out.

Or, just go hungry.  First trip (w a group of 6):  VERY dirty wine glasses, confused orders, out of key ingredients, mediocre food, and extremely slow service.  Second trip (group of 2):  Confused servers, again out of key ingredients (no Greek dressing for Greek salad).  Food arrived fairly quickly, which made it all the more amazing that the burger and fries were lukewarm.  I THINK the toppings on the burger were wrong, but they were not super recognizable.  Not to mention the glass with seriously chipped rim that could have drawn blood.  Why I went back I have no idea, I guess I believe in second chances.  Best to remember wise words from a past President:  \"Fool me once, shame on -- shame on you. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.\"",

We had a slight issue with a reservation we had made earlier in the day (they told us we did not have one) however it was corrected promptly. I had another sushi roll which was phenomenal...the truffle roll?  All three visits the service has been average to slightly below.

The interior is very nice and our server is friendly. I ordered the classic burger, priced at $9. To my surprise, the burger didn't come with any sides and if I wanted fries, it would be $4 extra. I was even more disappointed when the burger that came out was rather small. For $9 I would expect more, but if it tastes good I am willing to splurge. After one bite, I knew I wouldn't be coming back. While the burger was decent, it tasted similar to frozen patties from the store and wasn't worth the price. My coworkers did heap praise on the pretzel bun but felt similarly about the quality of the burger itself. You can get a much better lunch downtown for the price of this place.",

They accidentally put tartar sauce on it but the customer service response was excellent - the server apologized and left quickly to get me a fresh sandwich. Then the manager came over and apologized. They were so nice about it and pretty quickly I had a new sandwich with no tartar sauce. So kudos to them for the way that was handled!  And happily, the sandwich was delicious - tender, flaky fish in a crunchy Panko outside on a buttery brioche roll. My husband got the Bill's Burger.  Again it was delicious - juicy and flavorful on a brioche bun.  A special shoutout to their awesome crunchy house made potato chips!   Our server Jessica was fantastic - efficient, professional and friendly.  The only element that needs some tweaking is that the decaf coffee was very weak.

We just stayed at the Westin this weekend, my wife had a conference at the Omni hotel and we were able to get a great rate for the whole family at the Westin just a few blocks away. The hotel is excellent, so we thought this type of service would be extended to the hotel restaurant. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Our waitress could not have been more dismissive of us. When we initially arrived, she took the drink order for our boys, and when she came back to the take the rest of the order, she didn't ask my wife and I what we wanted to drink, we had to flag her down to get a drink order. I asked for a beer, she didn't then ask if we wanted refills. Never came back to ask us how we were doing, how the food was or if we needed anything else. I ordered my son another hot dog, it took 20 minutes, I couldn't believe she never even came to tell us why it was taking so long. Basically she dropped off our food and never checked in on us again. We had to flag down other waiters to get our check. Probably the worst experience at a restaurant, which is unfortunate b/c we had a great stay at the hotel.",

Was not aware the Burgers are a la cart on the menu and a side salad was $8. Not over impressed with the cost and quality of the food.  The burger was nothing special. The place was nice on the inside and two blocks from the office.  With that said, I have eaten better burgers at my house and other places. I would rather eat at Burgatory than Bill's.    However,  the service was great, David was a very good waiter and kept my glass filled.",

The hamburger size and quality was comparable to a McDonald's sirloin burger and tasted very gamey. Very overpriced ($9/basic/6-ounce) and underwhelming. Absolutely disappointing considering the quality of other local competition like Tessaro's, Burgatory, etc. Had a milkshake and it was very sweet, average, and also expensive ($6) for the taste and quality.  The location is great and the atmosphere is modern and large, so it would be good for groups. It is interesting that they also sell sushi!",

I wish I could remember our servers name. He kept coming over and checking on us and getting us drinks even after a wedding party came in and it started to get busy.

The waitress came over to the table three times and all three times and asked how things were and walked away before we could reply. The restaurant was not busy at the time of visit. The servers were also huddled in the corner at the station cussing up a storm. I understand it is a bar but every other word does not have to contain a cuss word.

It was late when we checked in so we weren't expecting much from the restaurant but we were definitely surprised. The staff was welcoming and very friendly. We sat at the bar and the bar tender walked over and greeted us immediately then excused himself as he was helping other customers at the time, which was ok with us being our exhaustion and barely able to look at our menus. The bar tender approached us soon after his greeting and went on explaining the menu, the different types of burgers, the amazing milk shake creations and he also pointed out his favorite items which was so helpful!  We both settled on our bartenders favorite the Blackened N Blue burger. OMG!!!! The best burger I have ever had hands down! Blue cheese, bacon, some amazing Worcestershire mayo, and the works! The manager came over to introduced himself and to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. I was almost done before I thought to look over and ask my husband if he liked his but he was already finished looking at me with the same unspoken excitement on his face. The manager came back over after we were done to see how everything was treating us. We couldn't thank him enough for the outstanding service and jaw dropping burgers. My only regret is we never took any pictures. We will definitely be back!",

We asked for a minute to decide on our order.  The server really took this to heart because he did not come back to check on our table for about 15 minutes.  I ordered the fat cat burger and fries.  The burger was overcooked and barely even warm by the time it got to me.  The flavor was below average and you could not taste much other than the special sauce they use.  I have never had a burger here that was juicy or came out anywhere close to hot.  On top of that, the french fries they use are incredibly generic looking.  They are the equivalent of McDonalds fries.  With so many good burger places in the downtown Pittsburgh area, do not waste a meal on this place.",

Two times I've been there and two times it was a bad experience with staff and food.   Definitely not worth the price and will suggest another place to eat when this place comes up as a choice.",

I thought the food was good and came back one other time before today...It's been several months since I was there and well, I remembered why I was only there that one other time.  The burgers are ok,  they are cooked medium, which I like, but they are on the smaller size, think whopper jr or McDonald's burger size . I ordered the bacon cheddar burger. The lettuce was wilty, bacon was burnt and the cheddar had about melted off so there wasn't hardly any left.when I got back to work to eat it the bun was soggy and I ended up throwing the bun away. For $12 + for a burger I wasn't impressed. You order fries seperately from the burger too and most of them are burnt.  The service is good, but, there are many places downtown where you can get a much better burger for your money.",

    "text": "I went to Bill's twice recently and must say my overall experience was a NO GO. As in, DO NOT GO HERE. Before you think I am overreacting, read on...  I went to Bill's for the first time for lunch. I was with a group of coworkers. Our group of six or so was seated quickly, which was a plus, but seeing as the place was half-full at most, that didn't require much effort. Our service at lunch was okay; I will say the server was friendly enough and knowledgeable about the menu. But here is where it gets hairy: the food is OVERPRICED AND A LA CARTE. You order your standard burger for $9 or so (they have variations on the base burger for up to $13), but then as you add on extras, you're paying for each topping. Now, this isn't a groundbreaking concept. Burgatory does this, but I have no problem paying $15 for a giant gourmet burger. Bill's burgers are comparatively standard in flavor and are about the size of a fast food burger. I'm talking small. Which is fine for lunch, but charge me $5, you know?! We were in and outta there in about an hour, which meant we were late getting back to work from our lunch hours.  But the real kicker here is when we decided to give this place another chance and go back for a birthday happy hour. We were greeted rudely... WELL, we technically were not greeted at all, as there was no one at the front desk when we walked in. So, as we scoped-out whether we wanted to sit in the bar or dining room, we were quite literally intercepted by one of the servers who said, \"UM [SIGH], DO YOU WANT A TABLE??\" To which we replied, \"Um, yes, please,\" and she then stated, \"Well, let me go back and check with, YOU KNOW, the GREETER.\" Read this in a rude, pretentious tone (THIS IS A BURGER JOINT!), and you get the idea. Keep in mind there was no one there when we walked in, no noticeable sign saying stay put and we'll seat you, and there is a GIANT BAR when you walk in that gives the SEAT YOURSELF impression. (This was this past Tuesday night, November 10, 2015, by the way, in case management gives a crap and wants to train their staff further...) This server (female) then grabbed a young woman walking by who we assumed was our server, because we weren't actually introduced, and hollered the word \"COMMUNAL!\" at her before scurrying away to ruin someone else's night... Okay, so we are seated at this large table in the dining room without actually being asked if we'd prefer the bar (there were only six of us - we're not talking giant party here), and told after we'd been sitting there for several minutes that this \"communal\" table meant that they MAY be seating another large party with us at any point, and therefore, we might have to move our stuff off the seats beside us to make room... ... ... OKAY. I won't even get into the inexperienced server, because everyone's been a new person at a job and waitressing is not easy, I get it, but this girl had NO guidance and seemingly very little training. When we asked for a manager after things were going downhill, THREE TIMES we asked, mind you, a manager never made an appearance and simply whispered things in our server's ear awkwardly behind our table. This happened. We were not rude, we just wanted someone to explain what the heck was going on with happy hour, because our server DID NOT KNOW, literally could not tell us what was on special, and she repeated twice that they were doing us a favor by extending the happy hour deals into the dining room, because they don't do that. THEN LET US SIT IN THE BAR! We were a party of six ready to spend money, and there were very few other customers in the restaurant, so we thought we'd be taken care of... Even just a piece of cake and candle, for god's sake: if you can't even do what T.G.I. Friday's can do, YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.  Oh, and their happy hour beer special was $5 DUQUESNE AND ROLLING ROCK BOTTLES. $5. You read that correctly. And $5 appetizers that were the size of my pinky finger. (I'm short.)  Awful, just... Bill's Bar & Burger & Disappointment.",

Then after telling her I had a sore throat  she made me a special ginger ale with mint leaves that not only soothed my throat but quenched my thirst as well. I'd recommend anybody to come back and see Kelly and ask for her signature \"twisted ale.\"",

I ordered the Cobb salad (pictured below) and was honestly not satisfied. I do understand that its a salad and pretty basic but it just wasn't that good at all. My players ordered the burgers and said they were pretty good,so that was a plus. The wings were great, the spinach dip was good as well (just salt your own chips).

The waiter was indifferent and his response was \"your food will be out soon...\" over the course of 45 minutes.  Additionally, his human interactions were not up to par with a hotel bar.  It's really sad that we wasted so much time waiting for mediocre food and shitty service.   It looks like Bills burger was left behind in the revitalization of Pittsburgh.  The burger got here cold, with no fries, even though the other three orders on the same table came with fries.    Not worth the time and not worth the price.  I will never come back here again and don't recommend it to anyone who wants a good eating experience.   Thanks for nothing, Bill's burgers. Your kitchen staff is awful and not worth a second try. Good job!",

We came towards the end of lunch rush, and weren't greeted by our server for nearly ten minutes. We put our order in and thought all was well, then heard our server telling the people that sat down after us that it would be 30-40min for food.... we got no such warning or we would have left. Fast forward to food getting here and the food was no good. I got the mamoooo and sweet potato fries, all of which were served a step above cold, but not hot (not even Luke warm). During our meal our server came to check in one time, and didn't even notice that my coworker couldn't eat his buffalo chicken burger because it was so burnt. Not a good experience overall, would not recommend.",

It's not a stand out place for me but it's a good place to go in a pinch when I've forgotten my lunch or we don't want to go outside in the winter or super hot days for work meetings.   Although, I can only base my opinions on their salads because that's all I've gotten here. Their salads are good. When you dine in, they give you a nice portion. But when you pick up, the portions seem to be a bit small- though this is the case for a lot of places when you pick up, never really knew why. I also order their homemade chips and they are super finicky with it. They don't give you many at all, yet they charge you too much for it. The service is nice, though. Never had a problem!  Again, I only eat here in a pinch and it's okay. Lots of other good options around this area to eat instead.",

    "text": "While not a place I would have initially picked as a dining spot due to its location, Bill's Bar and Burger has consistently surprised me with its service and the quality of its food. The bar staff create excellent cocktails that will delight you after a long day, and the kitchen also does a great job making orders that will please your taste buds.  During my last visit I was dining with family, so between the group of us we had a chance to test out multiple menu options. For an appetizer we ordered a stuffed pretzel, which was excellent; I'm admittedly sensitive to salt so I thought that particular item didn't need as much as it had, but I suspect a lot of people will be completely fine with that, as pretzels tend to be salty anyway. And the pretzel itself was fresh and warm, so I can't fuss too much!  For our main courses we ordered a veggie burger, sliders, and a pretzel bun burger between the group of us. Nothing disappointed. The meat-based burgers were all mouth-wateringly juicy and perfectly cooked; and my black bean burger set itself apart from being a \"blah\" vegetarian option with its tasty and even spicy toppings.  Unfortunately we failed to save room for dessert this time, which is shame: Bill's is home to some pretty fantastic oversized candy milkshakes. But hey: there are worse things in the world than wanting to come back in the future for dessert, right? I will indeed be back, for dessert and for another meal as well.",

Drinks were brought to our table and our appetizer & main orders taken.  We didn't see our server again until after our food came out. I don't blame the food taking so long on her. That's on the kitchen. Both our appetizer & main plates were not brought out by our server.  One of our friends in our party did not get her main meal with ours. The rest of us were nearly done before we saw our server again and w practically had to grab her arm to get her attention that one plate was missing. She took down our friend's order again. She finally got her plate 30 minutes later! Luckily when our server brought it out she offered to comp our friend's meal.  That was about the only thing done right. Most our burgers were just okay.  I've worked various positions in food service and this has probably turned me off from going again. Oh, and what bar runs out of ginger beer at 8:00 on a Saturday night for Mules when it's a featured drink?",

Coworkers had real meat burgers and I had the veggie burger since I'm a vegetarian.  They all agreed the meat burgers were okay but not super.  They also started off with Bill's meatballs for an appetizer and they agreed the meatballs were better than Mercato's meatballs down the street.  My veggie burger was okay but it was just a defrosted veggie burger patty which had the potential to be so much more.  I mean really Bill, find a recipe for a good black bean burger and implement it here!  They have jalapenos and guacamole as extras to add, so a black bean burger would really fit in well here.  Also, I cut my burger in half but still had the problem where I bit into it and the entire thing fell apart.  I'm talking everything was pushed out the other side.  I don't know how to make that better.  Toast the buns first maybe?  It was very messy.  One coworker just grabbed his fork and ate his burger and bun off the plate to cut down on the mess.  And the prices?  Yeah, totally unreasonable.  My veggie burger and side of fries came to a total of $12, before tax.  And about those fries - it was a small side order, totally not worth $4.  And they had some sort of seasoning on them that made it feel like I was chewing sand.  It was not a good crunch.  At all.  Bill, you should change that.",

My cheddar baconburger was served on a pretzel bun, making it more enjoyable for me.  This is a fine choice for an excellent burger meal in Downtown Pittsburgh.  A side note: my companion and I dined here during Piratesfest, the annual off-season gathering of Pittsburgh Pirates fans, which was taking place at the adjacent Convention Center.  The only other party in the restaurant at the time was that of Pirates Manager Clint Hurdle and his family.  It was our good fortune to have had the opportunity to go over and chat with them.

Everything on the menu is a-la-carte so a burger and fries is a hefty price for a lunch out. The meat was overcooked.  My friend ordered the cobb salad and said it was very good.  The other was the chicken salad and the meat was dry and the bread burned on the grill.  There is hope I guess, but I don't think this will be at the top of my list for downtown restaurants.",

    "text": "Went for a Happy Hour with coworkers from out of town, but even with \"happy hour\" pricing, 4 of us still made out of there with an over $330 bar tab which we feel was not right at all. We had $25 worth of food (which was really really good) but don't see how the bill could possibly be so much and we carefully reviewed each item and still could not see how the tab was that much - especially when we were there for \"happy hour\" prices on several of our drinks. Our waiter though nice and chatty seemed shady as he made seversl \"mistskes\" but allegedly didn't charge us for wrong or incomplete items he brought us, so even with that, there is just no way we could have had such a high bill. The issue was so shady/disputable that the manager even discounted our tab by $40. We left feeling scammed/targeted for being from out of town. My advice is if you go there, have the wings and pierogis but don't settle in for drinks.",

Facility and menu looked enticing enough (burgers, a few other varied options, and a large beer selection - basically your typical hotel sports bar/grill) so I ventured in. Sunday afternoon with Steelers playing at home it was pretty slow at 6 pm, and all TVs seemed to be tuned to the local favorite (which might have been an issue had my Cowboys not disappointed me yet again the night prior). Server was fairly attentive and friendly enough. Ordered the Fat Cat (iirc) burger - this is the \"CNN Top 10 burger\" they tout - I guess I buy that if they ranked only 25 or so. It was a good burger but not extraordinary at all. 6 oz patty (just right) was medium well but pretty moist, somewhat greasy. Sweet potato fries were ok and in a pretty large portion. All in all a decent meal at a fairly reasonable price (burger basket w/ fries $11.50 + 2.75 for iced tea; tax and tip and out the door down about $18).",

Of course he suggested we stay in the hotel and the only choice was Bill's.   After reading what other reviewers had to say about Bills I still decided to give them a chance. I'm staying here for four days I don't plan to dine here again. We ordered drinks first. $10.00 for a gin and tonic served in a large glass. Lots of tonic dilutes the gin.   We order burgers as that is 90 percentage the menu. Our server as Well as other reviewers recommended the big cat or the fat cat. We ordered both. With onion rings and sweet potato fries. Burgers will cost you $16.50 each with a side of store bought onion rings and fries. Don't ask if you can have your burger cooked medium or any other temperature. The burgers are so thin then come cooked one way well done. If you order the burger with a fried egg on top it also will be well done. I would also ask for a real burger bun. Burgers on English muffins are not my style. Hello Pittsburgh good by bills  After my last Review the manager asked me to post a review on their website. I decided to go back for lunch and give something different a try. I ordered the Cobb salad. It was a chopped up salad of bite sized pieces. I'm sorry to say three hours later I can still taste the onions that overpowered the salad.",

After walking around the area looking for something that caught my eye, I settled on walking back to my hotel for a burger and a beer.  The reviews were average but it was convenient. The server could not have been more friendly and helpful. I had their basic burger. It's two patties with lettuce, tomato, and onion, on a bun. It comes with their house-made chips or you can \"upgrade\" to fries or a salad at an extra cost.  The burger was a little greasy but not too bad. The meat had a good taste, it was not overcooked (a pet peeve of mine), but the chips were stale. The beer was good. Actually, both of them were good.  Overall, the server made the experience worthwhile - I believe he called himself DJ. Great guy - I ate alone so he came by to talk to me. This alone made it all good.",

My friend and I came down here from our room at The Westin Pittsburgh to order take out and was told by the hostess to order from the bar. We originally were served by a male bartender but he gave us a few minutes to decide what we wanted.  The other bartender came to serve us and with her we ordered  Bill's Burger with a side Garden Romaine salad and a Blackened Blue Burger that came with chips.  From the beginning she had a bad attitude but whatever, I brushed it off. Immediately after I ordered, I wanted to change something and tried to call out to her before she punched it through. I said \"sorry, excuse me\" in a somewhat loud but very polite tone because it was busy for St. Patrick's Day and I said \"excuse me\" a few times after because she didn't seem to hear me and she said \"yeah, I heard you. I just wanted to make it a take out order first\" in a non-caring tone... And I get not wanting to forget the original order but wouldn't a server/bartender want to know the customer's order completely before sending it through to the kitchen?  Her attitude was not necessary and it really put me in a bad mood for a while after we ordered. She then comes over after punching in the order and asks \"alright, what do you want?\" like she was annoyed with us...  What the hell? I am sorry that it's busy and she might be having a bad shift but do not take it out on me. I'm in the customer service industry too and I get it, some days are bad but it does not mean I base the rest of my shift on a bad experience.  When we went to pick up our food we paid with the male bartender and he was so much more friendly and courteous. I wish he served us the entire time.",

Happy hour food and drink was reasonably priced and super delicious. When a wing was missing from our order (due to new BOH hires, it happens!) kitchen manager Andrew came out to make sure we were well taken care of. Accommodating us with a few extra wings and a smile, it was clear to me that guest service is of the utmost importance. We'll totally be back! Probably for that Impossible burger",

Despite my girlfriend reading mostly bad reviews (and not telling me) she chose this place because it was located inside the hotel, which is the only good thing about this place, the waitress we had \"Shay\" was also very nice. The food is mediocre at best... Just horribly average to poor... The drinks are very pricey ($10-$15) and they take it upon themselves to supply you with Top Shelf liquor (how convenient... They're not paying for it). My best advice would be to go anywhere but here for food, you will only leave disappointed and a lot lighter in the wallet for very subpar food.",

The wait for our meals wasn't any better as we waited at least 40 minutes. The server did not come to check on us the entire time we waited. The food was mediocre at best, especially for the price.

We sent back the burgers since we were pretty clear that we wanted them separately. We had the salads, which were ok, not very good but not soul-crushingly terrible. I ordered the patty melt and my husband a double bacon burger. When they came his was a single so he sent it back. When I bit into my sandwich there was no meat. I opened it up and there were just crumbles of burger pressed into the bread, not a whole patty. At that point we just asked for the check and left. We paid for our drinks and salads and the fries, which were ok but again nothing to write home about. The manager comped the burgers we didn't eat - I think she should have done more but whatever, because we will not be back.",

The bar is way nicer and much better layout. I did not like the lighting which was set up on a grid under the drop ceiling and looked like a movie set. Just too much clutter when they could have a nice clean look.  They tables are terrible. They have huge bases and there is no room for your feet under the table. It felt like I had my legs wide open the entire time. Very uncomfortable!   Service was good but food was not.   Burgers are 8.00 with no toppings or chips or sides. They claim it was a hand made patty but it was a plain burger that was not hand made. Not to mention I ordered my med rare and it was about a 1/4 inch think and cooked well done.   And it was served on a plain bun on a old looking diner plate. Come on! At least care about your presentation and throw some chips or slaw on the plate. Charging $1 for a slice of cheese is just stupid.   Salads are $12 and up and not worth it.   So this is a burger place! So then why do they have sushi????? I can't figure that one out.

Not sure if that was on the waiter or the kitchen. They apologized profusely for it. There was also no on there on a Saturday night. I expected it to be packed. This will probably be a restaurant I check off my list and don't go back to.",

    "text": "I think that I and two of my co-workers have visited every Burger restaurant, joint, bar in the Downtown Pittsburgh area.  So, I made reservations for our pilgrimage to Bill's Bar & Burger expecting a blow your socks off burger experience.  Let me first say that the restaurant decor is inviting.  White tiled walls, red accents and dark wood accents, I was pleased with ambiance as well as the wait staff.  Friendly, without hovering, glasses refilled and plates cleared without asking.  Can't ask for much more than that.  Now on to the food.   Bill's Bar & Burger is supposed to be known for their amazing burgers and their use of a custom beef blend made especially for their restaurants.  I've heard people rhapsodize about their burgers and all three of us ordered the \"Bacon & Farmhouse Cheddar Burger\" with thick hickory bacon (nitrate-free), aged cheddar, lettuce, tomatoes and pickles served on a pretzel bun.    The burgers are supposed to be a Pat LaFrieda custom blend, fresh ground daily and hand-pressed into 6oz patties. (We'll talk about this later.)  We also ordered their regular fresh-cut fries and \"Iron City Fondue\" which included an Iron City beer reduction, local cheddar, whole grain mustard, soft pretzels and kielbasa.     So, let me just say that I was disappointed and underwhelmed by the food.  The famous Pat LaFrieda blend didn't seem to be hand-pressed at all and the burger wasn't well seasoned.  I've had Pat LaFrieda meat before and the burger that I had at Bill's Bar & Burger just didn't taste like their meat.  The burger was just okay; Not bad, just not spectacular.  I don't know what to say...  Additionally, the fries were tasty, but the order that I received had bits and pieces of fries. (Like they were the tail-end of the fry basket.)  With regards to the \"Iron City Fondue\", the beer reduction was a nice touch, but the whole grain mustard was overwhelming and the kielbasa had a strange aftertaste. (I think that it tasted a little like the fluid used to keep the fondue warm.)  There was also NOTHING distinctive about the pretzel bites. (They tasted like the frozen pretzel bites that you get at the grocery store.)  Overall, the restaurant is attractive and the service was great.  The food was just okay, which is really the main attraction.  The carpet doesn't match the drapes in my opinion.  I would go back again, but my expectation level has been readjusted.",

We were immediately greeted by the hostess and welcomed with friendly smiles throughout our journey to our large and romantic booth in the quieter dining area. The hostess Alexis was very informative of the menu as well as mentioning the landry select club to us. Our server Ken was very delightful. He answered all of our questions we had regarding the Landry Select Club because we do enjoy going to different restaurants but wasn't aware that our favorite restaurants had a club we could join for free basically. Since I am gluten free and have mushroom allergy I am normally limited to what I can order and it really affects where we can eat and drink. Kenn was so knowledgeable and recommended the strawberry spinach salad with shrimp. Let me tell you it was awesome. Everyone at Bill's including our bartenders Monica and Kimmy for the remainder of our evening were full of laughter and confidence and really efficient at their jobs.  Cannot wait to bring more friends and share this experience :)",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this place. I don't. For those people who say it's better than Burgatory and BRGR, they must work there and are trying to offset the reviews.   The burgers are small (6oz) and expensive and nothing you couldn't get at Eat n Park. You can double it for another $3.95 but then you're spending almost $15 for a boring burger. They say they come out medium by default which is what we wanted. They were both overlooked. Not a surprise since the parties are so thin.    Sides are al a cart. So it's even more expensive.   Spinach and artichoke dip was mediocre at best but it came with a basket of semi stale and broken chips. We had the few bigger pieces and ask for new ones. We got another basket of mostly small chip pieces again.   The shakes are pretty good and service was nice.   I can literally walk less than a block to dine here but I'd rather drive 15 minutes and wait in line for Burgatory any day.",

First impressions: the hostess stand staff needs some training on making guests feel welcome! The couple of chicks just standing there were more interested in complaining to one another than in giving a smile. Not good.   Upon getting to our table, there seemed to be confusion over who our waiter was, but was soon straightened out. At least he was friendly and helpful and knew the menu...including what is and isn't gluten free.  The food? A top notch, well cooked burger for me! The Onion Soup Burger was go good, I fact, I've been craving another ever since. 3 in our party really enjoyed the same selection. Others ordered the chili cheese fries, and several other burgers. Every single one of us are looking forward to a return trip.  Next time I'm opting for one of the boozy shakes! And the onion soup burger...soon!",

    "text": "Considering this place just opened, our experience was excellent. It's certainly a more accessible atmosphere and menu than its predecessor, The Original Fish Market, and definitely much more affordable. While I'll miss a handful of the menu items from the OFM, as well as the larger array of sushi offerings, Bill's is much more suited for economically-conscious visitors, convention goers, and really anyone unwilling to wait at some of the other, more established places downtown. There was plenty of staff on-hand and service was excellent. We were greeted by a nice hostess staff and manager, and once seated, had a wonderful experience with our waitress and the other staff that we interacted with. It certainly was a nice surprise based on some of the other reviews we had read. Perhaps we got lucky...perhaps others on here were unlucky. Either way, I have very little to complain about.  With many on here complaining about the high cost of a meal, I tend to disagree. I guess I'm just used to dropping $12+ on a burger, a la carte (a trend that's growing in the area as places like Burgatory continue to raise the bar on both flavor and cost expectation), but their price points fall below other popular places in the Pittsburgh area, albeit for a slightly smaller patty (6oz, when most promote 8oz). I got the Fat Cat burger, and it was delicious. It was a basic, greasy burger with American cheese and caramelized onion on an English muffin. Simple, and well-prepared (medium is their go-to temp, but they'll do whatever you prefer). The muffin was actually ideal for a greasy, medium burger. It didn't get soggy at all (although, to be fair, I housed that thing in about 2 minutes, so I never gave it a chance).   Our group ordered quite a bit from the menu. Aside from my Fat Cat, my wife got the steak & fries. The fries were, by far, the down side of the meal. A bit too soggy and undercooked. Her steak was delicious, but she orders similar meals at some other outstanding restaurants (Brewer's Art in Baltimore or Eleven in PGH), and it wasn't even close to on par with those places...especially not for the $25. The steak was really good, though. Her fries were honestly the only issue we had, though. The \"Frickles & Peppers\" were perfect and crunchy, with a hint of Old Bay to the batter. The vanilla shake was basic, but very good...so yummy, in fact, that I ended up starting AND ending my meal with one. For $5, it's a heck of a shake. Their side of charred broccoli was tasty, and the sweet potato fries were absolutely PERFECT. I can usually limit my fry intake, but not this time. Perfect level of crunch on the outside and soft on the inside. If my wife's fries were as perfect as the sweet potato fries, I'd have likely given Bill's five stars.  Overall, it's hard for me to be too critical, and I'm rating Bill's on a curve. It's not pretending to be fancy and I think the expectations set by the menu offerings and atmosphere place it in that TGI Friday's-level of expectations, only much better. We've been to so many places that delivered way worse experiences days after opening that I'm confident Bill's can succeed and only get better. With a pleasant and attentive staff, simple, well-executed menu, and - in my opinion - fair prices in a downtown restaurant scene that's continually getting more expensive, I'm oddly excited to return. Walking by this place every day means we'll either get to see it improve or worsen, but regardless, they've proven it's worth revisiting very soon! Check it out!  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Being new to this place it was confusing to know where to enter to get to this place because it has a sign on one end of the building with doors but when you entered it seemed like they have multiple entrances with no clear way where to start.  So you would want to make sure to enter near the hotel side of the entrance.  But I really enjoyed the Pasaneo's burger and the best part they have Gluten free buns as well as pretzel buns.  I would give it more stars but the entrance to the place really bothering because I ended up walking through the entire restaurant just to get to the hostess",

    "text": "I really enjoyed this restaurants venue! The bar is very nice, it's very very clean, well arranged and huge! I walked in an exit by accident and saw the whole place and there is nifty art on the walls and you can tell there's a lot of money wrapped up in it. Nice views of downtown and such. It's sorta easy to cruise down Liberty and miss it though. Only way in really is by Uber or parking in the Greyhound Station. They have an outdoor eating area that should open up soon id think when it's not cold out. I had this awesome blue Hawaiian alcoholic drink that was a 10/10. They didn't skimp on alcohol! And my burger was the Konnichiwah Burger and the Chili and let me tell you it was pretty good. The chili was well done and flavorful run of the mill countryfied meat/bean chili and the burger was so good. It may sound silly but they don't use a bun that fills you up. You get full on the meat and fixins. The bun is simply there and small which is how it should be. It's attached to the Westin, so if you're staying there and need some food this is one of a million places you can go. :)",

    "text": "I honestly had no ideas this place was in the Westin until a fabulous Yelp event held here introduced me.  I couldn't wait to go back and we did a few weeks later for drinks after a wedding held across the street at the Pennsylvania.  This place is spacious and great for large groups.   They have a nice mix of drafts and bottled beer plus cocktails.  We went back last week for dinner and drinks and sat in the bar area (separated from the dining room which I really like) so we could get the happy hour specials. They offer 1/2 drafts and I went with the Fathead's Bumbleberry. My fiance ordered 2 different Southern Tiers.  The appetizers are also 1/2 off from 4-7 (love the longer happy hour) and we went with the mini hotdogs.  It was basically a gourmet corndog cut into pieces with mustard but the way they presented it made it taste that much better. Delicious and a perfect snack before the main entree. I went with a side Cesear salad (the portion could have been bigger) with the mini B burgers (comes with 3 sliders with pickles, cheese and onions) for my entree. They were fantastic and it was the perfect amount of food.  The rest of the burgers come on their signature pretzel bun with a side of chips.  You have to save room for dessert as they have amazing milkshakes. Since we were celebrating a birthday we had to order the chocolate bomb or whatever it is called as it is the biggest milkshake you can imagine served with a sparkler.  It has crushed up Butterfingers, peanut butter cups, reeses pieces, peanuts, chocolate icing and whipped cream. It is amazing and enough for two! Our waitress was great and we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Despite a lot of negative reviews, I decided to visit Bill's on a Friday afternoon. As a Landry's Select Member, I like to visit the different restaurants and gain points along the way. I got there around 4pm. The restaurant was not crowded, but also not empty. I was able to get seated immediately. The hostess and waitress were pleasant and the food actually came promptly. She provided me extra time to decide from the menu and even checked back to make sure everything was ok or if I needed anything extra. I ordered the salted caramel shake which was delicious. The blackened and blue burger was tasty as well and I paid the $1.50 upcharge to get fries instead of chips. For the 22 oz milkshake, burger and fries, my bill came to about $28 with tax. Do I find this pricey? Very much so! Although gourmet burgers are typically good, I have never truly had one and said that was worth $15. The reality is that it's hard to get a burger these days outside of McDonald's or Wendy's that isn't expensive. The gourmet burger trend is in. This burger was on par with what I typically would get at a place like Burgatory. I had a good experience. I don't eat beef frequently, but based on my experience, I would go back if I wanted a tasty shake or didn't mind paying premium for a burger.",
