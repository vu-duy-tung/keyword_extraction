    "text": "I ate here a couple of weeknights with my girlfriend and two other friends for dinner.  The inside of the place was not what I was expecting although I am not sure what I was looking for exactly. There is a large square shaped bar running almost the length of the restaurant in the middle of the floor with booths on one side and a high tables on the other side.  It was also a bit dark in the place but I think that was part of the vibe and I did not mind it.  After we were seated, our waitress came over and told us that for their happy hour specials they had draft Arsenal Ciders on sale for $5 and draft East End brews on sale for $3.  I loved that they were featuring local brews and not being ones to miss a good deal, my girlfriend and I both had an East End beer while the other couple also decided on an East End Beer and an Arsenal.  For our dinner my girlfriend and I decided to split the Buffalo Mac & Cheese appetizer while I had the Outsourced Burgher with an upgraded side of brussel sprouts with bacon & Gorgonzola and she went with another burgher that is eluding me at the moment.  The Mac & Cheese was delicious with cavatappi pasta, a cheddar cheese sauce and large chunks of boneless buffalo chicken.  My girlfriend and I both commented about how nice the chicken inside of it was and I think that it could have easily been a smaller entree.  My Outsourced Burgher came with habanero jack cheese, hot peppers and an aioli sauce.  It wasn't the best or spiciest burger that I have ever had in my life but it was still moist and I ended up enjoying it.  Finally I also enjoyed the brussel sprouts although I am not sure that they were worth the $4 up charge that I paid for them.  Everyone else at our table also enjoyed their meals and the other couple at our table were raving about the truffle fries that one of them had upgraded to.  We were close to staying around and getting one of their smokestacks where they infuse some smoky flavor into some bourbon after we were told about but at that point we were already full and so decided to let it wait for another time.  The bottom line for me is that I would definitely head back here in the future.  I am really looking forward to trying the smoke stack at some point but I also thought that their drink list was impressive and both the food and the service was good.",

The foods aren't bad, per say, just overly heavy. The drinks remind me of that admittedly very smart freshman who thinks they know more than their professor because can throw around the word 'Marxism.' The cocktails are definitely rather inventive, but more gimmick than substance. For example, the idea of infusing a drink with cedar smoke is neat, and it looks cool in motion, but the drink itself really pales in comparison to the process.",

It was because they only had one server working the entire lunch shift. My food was good...the inside out cajun chicken sandwich had lots of flavor. My issue was that after our meal a coworker spoke to the manager about how slow it was (an hour and a half). The manager kept blaming our group for being too large. Then, when she said she would not return as a customer,  he said, \"that's fine\". I understand we were a larger group, but you should be prepared for the amount of seats your bar area holds. This was not the first time I was there, and service seems to be a bit of an issue every time. So, although the food is good,  you are better off at one of the many other places in Lawrenceville.",

    "text": "Good place to grab drinks.  Decent food.  Nice space.  Went around 6:30pm on a Wednesday night a was seated right away.  Seems like it would be a great place for groups.  Really casual, but more on the trendy side.  There's about 100 options of beers to choose from, and I started with their house-brewed IPH, which was their version of IPA and not super hoppy, but a littttle on the sour side.  Most of our group ordered burgers.  I wouldn't say they are the best burgers I ever had.  I'd give it a 6/10.  Nothing special, but definitely not bad.    Main compliant I have is that my fiance ordered his burger medium rare, but his was definitely more medium/well done.  Mine was ordered medium, but came out a little more medium rare.  We ordered different types of burgers, so this definitely was a mixup.    I also ordered the Truffle Fries, which were yummy.  How can you go wrong with Truffle Anything!!  The fries are slightly thicker cut, but not wedge style fries and were cooked really well.  I didn't love the cheese crumbles that were on top of it though.  So I'd give the fries 7/10.    I also ordered the Carnegie Cucumber and it was the highlight of the meal for me!  I always love a well made cocktail.  Simple, crisp and strong.  Seemed a little pricey to me, more like LA-pricing to me, but you definitely get a LARGE glass, so it's definitely worth it!  I really want to go back and try their other cocktails!",

I walked in and immediately grabbed a seat at the bar and studied their cocktail list. I'm not gonna lie, it took me awhile to really look at it. I decided to go with the a drink that was graced with the presence of a Nolet Gin, being as I'm a huge gin advocate. I can't remember the name of it, but I do know that it was lit on fire in front of me as it was being prepared and it contained legitimate rosemary and was topped with absinthe. This particular drink was one of the most amazing drinks I've ever had with Gin in it. Who the F came up with this drink?? It's divine! My roommate got the Carnegie Cucumber which was pretty good as well, but I definitely liked mine better.   To eat, I went with the Worker's Burgher cooked at a most perfect medium-well and it was impossible to put down. The burger was topped with arugula cheese and caramelized onions;  I loved it.  The whole vibe of Industry is awesome and I want anyone and everyone to partake in it.",

In addition to the waiter bringing out some of our food, the sous chef made some appearances and cracked some jokes. His boisterous personality made me laugh.  The nachos were delicious though nothing spectacular but I ordered the mushroom burger and a beer for my main. The mushroom burger was very vinegary but it suited my palette and I devoured each bite along with the beer and fries. Overall my stomach was content. I will be back here for sure. I'd suggest that if they were to improve upon anything is to have the windows in the front open up.",

Everything we've had to eat has been good.  The nachos are our standby, and I'll post a photo as soon as I remember to take one before devouring them.  If you add the chili, they can serve as a meal for two (or at least that's what we do frequently!).  Just beware the fresh jalapenos, they're often pretty hot.  The fish and chips are also great, and the coleslaw that comes alongside is really tasty, creamy & vinegary.  Their house fries are definitely good, as are the house smoked wings.  The buffalo mac n' cheese flatbread is tasty but on the small side, as are all of their flatbreads, but good for a snack and a great happy hour deal at half off.  Happy hour (or social hour, as it's called) runs from 4:30-6:30 on weekdays and will get you a couple $ off draft beers and some deals on apps.  Worth checking out if you haven't been!",

Tasty bar food selections include some creative burger selections and I swooned over the Caribbean Burgher made with fresh pork & chorizo sausage, jerk sauce & a grilled pineapple, poblanos & jalapenos. I liked it so much, it will get ordered again soon along with a great beer, most likely!",

Also we ordered an app and entree.  The app came quickly which was nice and why I gave 2 stars instead of 1.  However it seems the entree order got lost in the shuffle and after 40 minutes of waiting we canceled our order and left.

We came in at 11 on a Thursday night, and the place was packed and the walls were shaking with TouchTunes selections. Our poor server seemed to be the only waiter on our side of the room so service was slow, but forgivable. The chili cheese fries were good, but $9 for a no frills appetizer seemed a bit much--until my boyfriend got his paella. $18 for about 2 cups worth of unseasoned chicken, unevenly reheated \"saffron rice,\" and a few peppers. Granted, Industry doesn't look like the place you should order paella at, but still! My Marconi and Cheese with bacon was alright; bacon was very satisfying but it sat under the heat lamp a little bit too long so the cheese was mostly fused to the bowl by the time I got it. Marconi is rolling in his grave, but I imagine the profit margins at this place must be great.   No, the truly amusing part of the meal was watching the kitchen staff. My boyfriend came out of the bathroom with a disgusted look on his face and said that one of the guys just took a dump and charged out of there without washing his hands... maybe he washed them in the kitchen? That employee then proceeded to pull something out of one of the plates waiting under the lamps with ungloved hands (it turned out to be my boyfriend's dish). Another employee was just standing around picking his teeth for a solid 10 minutes. Then he got a cocktail straw and proceeded to dig with that instead of his fingers.   Bottom line: don't make this your first stop in Pittsburgh. If you do, sit at the bar (also, apparently this place has cocktails).",

    "text": "Great food here, as well as a great selection on drafts and bottles and any liquors really. It seems that they specialize in whiskey and bourbon but there were several tequilas and vodkas to choose from as well. I ordered the induction salad which came with watermelon. I'm not that fond of fruit in my salad but this was actually refreshing. A large bed of arugula with a light balsamic dressing and pickled onions. YUM! Those onions were fantastic!!  The hubby ordered the pot roast which I hear is very popular and now I know why. The meat is cooked to be very tender and it just pulls apart when you dig in. The gravy was creamy and completed the mashed potatoes very well. On top of all the deliciousness they added onion straws which made the whole dish that much better. The portion was a very nice size enough for two to split if your not starving.  The only bad thing was that the service was super slow! We sat at the bar and our original bartender only came over to use twice. Once to ask what we wanted to drink and then once to ask us how are food was. It was the guy with the curly mustache. I had to flag down another bartender just so we could order our food. He spent all his time at the opposite end of the bar and never even turned his head to see if we needed help. The fact that there were 3 bartenders and I had to flag someone down to help us order is unacceptable!!  Get your service skills together!!",

Feeling relieved, I stopped at the bar to order a drink.  It was mid afternoon, and a group of young people asked me to party with them (I am an old guy.)  So sweet, and it turned out to be great fun.  I have only had lunch here, but everything has been very good.  I have a friend from California who won t come to Pittsburgh without hitting Industry for pot roast fries.  We get an order to split as an appetizer.  The quantity is generous, and either some of the fries or the sandwiches/salads we order gets left behind.    Looking forward to getting over there for dinner one evening (live in Squirrel Hill.)",

The salad came dry, no dressing on it or on the side which was pretty annoying, and it BARELY had any onion, but it did include a meaty dead moth (also pretty annoying and very gross).  I for one like my salads to be moth-free. It made the whole thing inedible...I only wish I had noticed it sooner.   The sandwich was underwhelming. I don't understand why anyone bothers to put horseradish on a sandwich if they use so little that it's undetectable. And maybe that's intentional since a lot of people may not like horseradish. But I'm a fan of horseradish and if the intention is to make it seem like it's not even there then why bother to have it there at all. Just saying.   The popcorn was fine.  Good drink menu as well I suppose.",

They were so easy to work with while planning and could not have been more kind accommodating that night. The service was incredible, the food was fantastic, and the whole thing went off without a hitch. I have been to Industry before for drinks and for dinner and it's always been great, but quality for a table of 4 can differ from that for a large-scale party. Industry did not disappoint, and their catering was just as good as any meal I've had there. I received compliments from all attendees on every aspect of the party and am so grateful for all of Industry's handwork in helping me to make the night so special. I would not hesitate to book another event here and highly recommend Industry if you want to hold a successful event! Thank you!!",

    "text": "Industry was the pre-Mr Smalls-concert destination for dinner and drinks on Tuesday night. I had been here once before and was a little underwhelmed by my experience after having heard several rave reviews. However, my experience last week was much improved, and I really enjoyed my drink and food.  The restaurant is an inviting environment with large garage door-style windows at the entrance and a bar so large that it is probably never completely full. We sat at the bar, where I was actually a bit disappointed by the slowness of the service. We were on a bit of a timeline to get to our concert, and our bartender disappeared for a long period of time before collecting our dinner orders.  I ordered some sort of summer berry cocktail off the special menu listing, which was really tasty and delightfully strong. We started with a fried mozzarella appetizer. The mozzarella was an above-average quality and was flavorful and stringy. The five mozzarella circles were topped with a savory marinara sauce made with lots of basil. For my dinner, I almost ordered fish and chips but was happy when the hubby pointed out the Wheelhouse Ravioli. The \"spicy marinara\" in the description concerned me, but they actually used the exact same heavy-on-the-basil (in the perfect way) marinara that came with the mozzarella. The ravioli had a tasty filling of beef, goat cheese, and greens. Ravioli is one of my favorite foods, and I would definitely order this dish again.",

Besides my appreciation for it's aesthetic - the food here is very good at least from what I've tried so far. We were here for Brunch and I had the Corned Beef Hash and my lady had the Morning Meal. They were both really good but I'd take the Corned Beef Hash over the Morning Meal anytime.  However, the service here seemed a bit slower than expected. I'm not blaming the servers - they were very attentive and polite. It's just that the food took some time to get from the kitchen to our table. But I'll take that as a positive thing by assuming it was cooked fresh from scratch :)",

The only downside is that the gluten-free options are quite limited, and there has been a lack of knowledge about what is/isn't GF from staff.

The restaurant has a very cool design featuring a polished rustic theme and unique lighting treatments throughout.  The first thing I noticed in the unique menu was the seemingly endless selection of beers on tap. The whiskey offerings were also impressive.  Food items found on the menu showcase blue collar eats with a twist. Portions were very generous and our food was quite tasty. (See photos) Servers and staff presented that very common \"hip\" vibe that sometimes comes off as careless. Our own server was competent but she sometimes allowed too much time to pass between checking on us.  Overall I was very pleased with Industry and will try it again.",

I knew going in it might be a gimmick to get people interested in the place and it worked on me.   We were seated by the bar at a high top table. It was a few min before our waiter came out and brought waters without me having to ask. This was very nice. He also later brought out a glass bottle of water for the table. Loved this!!! I ordered my smoked bourbon. There is a nice long list of options. I chose a blackberry house bourbon with cherry wood and made sure to ask for them to make it on my side of the bar. It is definitely a fun drink to watch being made. It was finished with a large ice cube and an orange peel. This might have been my favorite drink EVER. Even more then my beloved Samos Nectar.   For my entree I chose the Worker Burgher. It was delish. The goat cheese with the caramelized onion was perfect. The fries were just ok. They didn't have much of a crunch and were over salted. I can say they were definitely fresh though.   I must give a shout out to our server who was excellent. I've been disappointed with service lately and he restored my faith.  Also I could see the kitchen window and they have a designated expediter. This was nice and I never just saw food sitting in the window. I find it hard to justify going to a restaurant more then once when I'm going out because there are so many great options in the Burgh but this is a place I wouldn't think twice about coming back to.",

Maybe we just caught them on an \"off\" day, but here's the breakdown of the experience:  Simple order for two including one of their house beers (copper ales), a burger (the farmed-out burger), a salad and a specialty cocktail.    Where things went awry:  After a bite into my burger, the bartender informs me that I was given the wrong burger.  Not wanting to make a fuss and because the burger wasn't that bad (just not what I ordered and overdone) I said it was fine a kept eating.  As the meal continued we realized that my dining partner had received the wrong salad AND the wrong drink!  Combine this with a less than personable staff and the dining experience was solidified.  No apology or we'll take a couple bucks off...

Overall, Industry is worth trying, but there are better choices, especially for food.",

Had a pumpkin beer on tap after tasting a couple of samples. We ordered popcorn for the kids and were unimpressed. I had the Lucy Furnace 2.0 and it was OK but nothing amazing. The chili cheese fries were pretty good. When we were done, the server simply dropped us the check and never asked if anyone wanted dessert, even though one of the arty came here to try the bourbon bread pudding. She never returned, by the way. A so-so experience. With all the other restaurants in this great city, I don't need to come back here.",

Very few descriptions of the beers exist on the beer menu, which unfortunately you can't leave to your server (in my case, Sophia) to remember tidbids about. She was attentive anyways but oh boy, if you have a beer list that big, I would half expect these people to be somewhat excited to talk about beer.",

The nachos and beers my friends and I had were top notch though and the service was prompt and friendly.  Now for round two.  My parents took my wife and I here for my birthday lunch.  We all started with beers and Industry's draught list is expansive and good.  We then ordered popcorn which was full of flavor and perfect for a light appetizer with our beers.  We then all got different burgers.  I got the farmhouse one with cheddar, bacon, and a dippy egg.  The meat was a little dry, but full flavor.  I'd give the burger a 4 out of 5.  The fries however were amazing.  Fresh cut, crisp, and it was an excellent choice to upgrade to fries with pot roast and gravy.  A very filling lunch.    So once again Industry just misses the mark, but I really like the place.",

After drooling over items on the menu like \"Wild Boar Bacon\" and \"Aged White Cheddar\", my SO and I opted for a goat cheese flat bread, the farmed out burger, and the Electric grilled cheese sandwich.   Portions were very generous - and a good value of pricing. But our meals missed a a \"wow\" factor despite the ingredients. Good solid food, but not able to hit the mark they were shooting for. The bacon was a little too salty, the cheese a little too bland, the flat bread toppings generous but unbalanced.   The service was commendable (on a Wednesday night) and the food was solid good pub food with fair pricing. I wasn't impressed with the margarita, but it's hard to beat a good $4.50 house IPA. They also have a very extensive beer selection (but that's not anything new when you live on the South Side.)  If Industry were in my neighborhood, I would probably go back on a regular basis, but as it's across town, it won't have the allure to bring me back unless I'm already in the neighborhood.",

The smokestack whiskey is definitely worth a try- and it's best to ask your waitress of bartender what flavors they recommend with particular whiskeys. Their popcorn appetizer is refreshingly simple and well-made. The side of bacon is a steal at only $3 for a hefty plate of thick strips. And, of course, their burgers and sandwiches (anything with meat, really) are great.  Beware of making reservations too late on a Friday or Saturday night.

I was in the 'Burgh recently, and as part of our Lawrenceville bar crawl we ended up at Industry.  The food is decent, prices are ok, and tap selection is great. Service, however, was HORRIBLE! We grabbed a spot at the bar and got our first round of drinks relatively easily; after that, it was like pulling teeth to get any of the multiple bartenders to just recognize anyone from our side of the bar. At one point (after waiting 15 minutes without a single glance from any of the bartenders whisking by back and forth) I very politely said \"Excuse me\" to a bartender filling up some glasses. Without even looking up, she gave me the 'one minute' sign with her index finger, said \"Just a minute\", whisked her drinks to the other side of the bar, and never made eye contact for the rest of the night.  I've never been in a place where it seemed like the staff was actively ignoring quite literally half the patrons. Had it been just me, I would have maybe questioned if I was doing something innappropriate to cause such behavior, but it was the entire side of the bar that got this treatment.  We had considered doing our rehearsal dinner at Industry but eventually decided against it (and I'm really glad we didn't, in hindsight). Unfortunately, I cannot recommend Industry any more, especially considering the wealth of competition a short walk away on Butler Street.  2 stars for decent food and good tap list, but that's all I can recommend for Industry. They have fallen a long, long way from the place I used to frequent.",

The smoke stack steak sandwich also had more fat than I expected but did get better when I asked for a side of the horseradish aioli to dip it in, and the Mac and cheese was lacking flavor as well.

Josh was up for something different tonight. \"American, or whatever,\" he said, all hangry as I attempted to parallel park in a spot no bigger than my Kia. Okay, boss. Whatever you want.   We were seated immediately in the bar, at a kind of small table for two adults to enjoy large plates of food, but they make it work with a long beam that fuses the three tables in the section together.   Our server, Alex was great. He made suggestions when we asked, and was attentive. I asked him about the home soda of the day and it was Lemon Thyme. WOWZA. If it wasn't an overcast day in April, and it was one of Pittsburghs stupid 90 300% humidity July days, it would have been perfect.   Josh ordered the Farmed Out (yes, if you follow me, that's his second burger with an egg and bacon inside of a week) and he couldn't stop saying how good it was.   I had the Blast Pig, only because I saw like three million picture of it here on yelp! Holy Moley.  Candied bacon, candied jalapeno, candied onion. Now, to some, that might be too much candied food. It was perfect up against the garlic aioli. Melt in your mouth AMAZING.   Go here. Run here. Get here now.   Happy Eating!",

I really didn't want to leave but we had other places to go.  I love the dark decor too ..  so ideal for a bar setting.   I have had great experiences at other locations too.  Thanks Industry!",

I guess that's the best way I can put it, but I always enjoy going. The beer selection is always great, especially if you enjoy craft beer like my friends and I. The crowd is older than college students, but ranges widely. I got a salad with salmon once and a burger, both were awesome. For appetizers I 100% recommend the soft pretzel. It's HUGE.",

It's a very open atmosphere which is important to me since I find most bars and pubs pretty suffocating. In the summer, it has a relaxed indoor/outdoor style seating area (you're seated inside but the windows are wide open so you get lots of fresh air without the sunburn).  They have great appetizers that are enough to share with a small group...especially the pub pretzel. The thing is enormous!!!!   I've yet to have bad service there. The waiters are really nice and upbeat without being over attentive and pushy.   Love it here and will keep coming back!",

I would have actually liked to have spent some money here, but after 15 minutes of sitting at the trash and dirty dish covered bar and not even getting eye contact from the bartender as she walked past us 6 times, we left. I will say, though that the bartender was hustling, but clearly had more going on than she could handle. Your manager should have stepped in and gotten her some help. Going to chalk this up to a bad, post-holiday afternoon ... at least I hope that's the case. Too much competition in this city for a place to be run that way.",

Ordered a worker burger with no bun + upgraded to sweet potato fries. Only half of the fries were actually cooked all the way thru. Couldn't eat the rest. That was an extra $4   The burger was supposed to medium. It was medium well almost well. Supposed to have caramelized onions on top. They looked like the tossed them in the pan for two seconds. No where close to being caramelized in color and taste. Burger was dry and flavorless.   The only highlight was the Arsenal cider  This place used to be great. Really sad what has happened. Will never come back. Service + food were awful",

It was busy, loud, there were children screaming somewhere but I couldn't see them (WHY ARE THERE KIDS IN A BAR??) it was 9 p.m.  I ordered some grilled cheese with bacon concoction and my date ordered some brisket.  Let's start there... the grilled cheese was burned, yet also soggy.  The bacon was chewy gummy rubbery and just vomit inducing.  I didn't finish it.  His brisket?  Oh that was dry and completely inedible.  He compared it to chewing those jerky shreds they sell, over salted and dry like leather. Cocktails? Oh lordy lord.  They were watery.  Poorly mixed. Slow to come.  My waiter was a total bro dude who couldn't understand what we were saying because the music was blasting and overly loud.  oh, we wanted to order another cocktail?  No?  The waiter has disappeared?  Oh that's him out front smoking a cigarette and flirting with the scantily clad girl.  That's okay I'll just flag down another waitress and ask for my check.  Oh, I can't do that either?  I need to \"wait for my real waiter to get back\".  Sure. I'll just sit here for another 45 minutes making awkward and forced conversation. They've now expanded to be even bigger. So a small shit farm is now a humongous factory of utter shit.   Cool.   What is this place good for?  Nothing.",

My most recent lunch, it took over an hour to bring out dishes... and we almost just walked out.  2. Twice now at lunch, I've ordered the chicken breast entree. BOTH times, only after waiting for everyone else's food has started coming out, they've come by to tell me that they were out of chicken breasts. Each time, I instead opted for a salad -- for which, surprisingly enough, they happened to have chicken breasts!  3. They upcharge for drinks to be served neat and claim this is a standard practice.  In total, I'm thinking my coworkers and I will start heading elsewhere for lunches and happy hours in the future. This place is pretty disappointing.",

Around the 30 minute mark, I asked the hostess how long it would take and she said that they're waiting for a table to clear out, but because they're just hanging out, we can't be seated. Soooo...you're telling me that that's the only three person table in the entire establishment? Very confusing, indeed. Finally when we were seated, the three of us couldn't believe how loud it was! My friend was sitting next to me (like, RIGHT next to me) and I couldn't hear a word she said to me, just bass. Lots and lots of bass. Thumping music would be fine if I were at a club, but I wanted to have a nice meal with some friends so the music was a bit excessive.  I digress. I ordered the pot roast (my very first ever!) and it was very tasty. The meat was perfectly cooked and packed with flavor as was the beef gravy poured over top. The smashed potatoes that came along with the meal might well be one of the best potatoes I've ever had...super buttery and melted in your mouth. The service was kind, but incredibly slow. We waited probably close to 20 minutes for our food to come out, which was irksome since we had to wait a long time just to be seated.  Bottom line: this place is pretty decent, however, I do find it to be pricey. The wait is long and the service is slow, although they are very nice. Go here if you want to just dig in, since conversation won't be happening over the blaring music.",

Everything you could want in someone who pours your drinks. If they aren't busy, they willingly come up with some creative options and make great recommendations. Very cool atmosphere and ideal location. It's loud, so don't hit this up for a romantic first date, but it's always a good time at night.  I've eaten here probably 5 times and never had a good meal. The servers vary between awesome and downright rude, so that's a gamble. The dessert ravioli is incredible, but I've never had an appetizer or entree that wasn't overwhelmingly salty- and that's not a complaint I've ever made of any restaurant.  My verdict? This is a great spot for drinks and a snack at the bar, and an even better spot if you're single and looking to mingle or ready for a fun night out, but I wouldn't recommend it for a meal.",

The atmosphere is very casual and laid back.  The bar tender was very attentive.  We got a beer each and it was hard to pick because they have a nice selection.  I got one from a local brewery, which was quite good.  I also ordered a flatbread which hit the spot.  I thought it was too big for a \"snack,\" but my husband helped me with it.  Lots of fresh mozzarella cheese and a crisp crust.  He got some boneless wings that the server recommended.  I was glad he got the half pound because it was a lot of food.  the wing sauce had a good spice.",

    "text": "Okay, but not great. People seem to LOVE this place so I feel a little weird writing this.  The first time I came here was to meet a friend for an post-dinner drink on a random weekday. The bartenders weren't particularly warm and friendly. Nothing really stood out from the visit. The second time was for happy hour with a few friends. I had their IPH IPA, which was decent. Happy hour pricing is pretty good, with $2 off drafts. The beer was fine but nothing special.  Yesterday I had lunch with a friend here, which was my first time trying the food. I ordered the Smoke Stack sandwich: shaved ribeye, white cheddar, arugula, and horseradish on sourdough. I enjoyed the ribeye with the melted cheese and horseradish (though it could have used more, to be honest). My only complaint is that there seemed to be an overwhelming texture and flavor of butter--I believe from the bread. It seemed like it was brushed or slathered on, and it was just too much. It gave the sandwich a greasy texture that just sort of ruined it for me.  I had a side of the loaded truffled fries. They were served with a very generous portion of the gorgonzola/truffle oil combination. They were good but extremely rich, so I could not finish the portion.  My friend had the fish and chips. She was served two GIANT pieces of fish, and commented that there were some uncomfortably soggy spots within the pieces. I tried a bit and it was okay, nothing amazing.  The atmosphere is pretty cool, I'll give them that. The bar/restaurant is also very spacious with plenty of seating. I'll probably stick to happy hours here going forward.",

They have really nice specials ... but I would have rather paid full price to have things done right.   The bar-tenders were forgetful and not attentive at all ... and they weren't even busy!   I really want to like Industry, but it just hasn't proven itself to me. I'll probably give it another shot at some point, but it's not going to be any time soon.

A dining companion ordered the mozzarella wheels and when they arrived, 3/5 had no cheese in them. It took us over an hour for us to receive our meal. When our food finally came, my order was incorrect. We decided to order dessert (either creme brulee or bread pudding) and we went with the creme brulee. It was awful. It was cold & very thick. I exchanged it for the bread pudding which was slightly better.  I've been to the Lawrenceville location before & had no issue. I'm definitely not coming back to this location.",

    "text": "HOLY COW was this place LOUD. There are brick walls and really high ceiling so noise really bounces around and is amplified in there. They could really benefit from installing some sound absorbing blocks to make it a little quieter. We were there on a Sunday afternoon and it wasn't even that busy and it was still crazy loud. I can't imagine being there on a Friday or Saturday Night.  Other than the noise, the food was pretty delicious. My husband and I split a few of the appetizers. We're a huge fan of Burgatory's gorgonzola truffle fries. My husband enjoys them so much that he gets an order all for himself every time we go. So needless to say, when we heard Industry Public House also had Gorgonzola fries, we wanted to try it out.  The fries didn't disappoint. They were smothered in melted Gorg! We nearly cleared the whole plate and it was a big serving! We also got the boneless wings, which were different from your traditional boneless wings. These guys were more like striks than the typical chunks of breaded chicken served as boneless. They were also very light on the breading. I think the strip-style made them a little dry, but they were covered in sauce so it didn't deter from the taste too much. I think I still prefer the more traditional boneless wing though.  We also got the buffalo chicken macaroni and cheese. All of the flavors were on point. The only complaint I have is that the chunks of chicken were really big and I think it would have been a lot better with smaller pieces that were mixed throughout the mac instead of piled on top. I'd get it again though because who can say no to buffalo chicken mac and cheese? Obviously not this girl.   The menu had lots of other items I'd love to try so I think a repeat visit will be in order in the near future.",

As a cheap college student, I think IPH is unfortunately overpriced. The burgers are around $14/15 and the drinks are on the expensive side as well. All the times I've come to Industry Public House I thought the staff was a little snooty and wasn't polite to me or the rest of my group. The other thing I wasn't crazy about was that it's super loud in the restaurant and it can be very hard to hear someone else. Overall, I really like IPH and it's always a treat to go to whenever I'm in Lawrenceville.",

When we arrived, the place was already packed which we expected considering it's the weekend before St. Patty's. We got a table without a wait which was great. And then we realized we weren't going to be able to have a conversation because the music was so loud.   We got the truffle oil & gorgonzola fries and fried pickles. Both really delicious! Comfort food at its best.  My husband and I are both big whiskey drinkers. We were excited to see such a big whiskey list, but disappointed to find only a couple of cocktails centered around whiskey. Isn't it a whiskey bar? We were disappointed by it. For sake of trying something new, for his first round my hubby got the War of Currents cocktail, and I went for the Union Bushel. We both enjoyed the drinks, though we had to admit that with the excessive amount of ice in the glasses they were hard to mix and by the time we got halfway through it was half water.   Second round, he did the Smoke Stack with Knob Creek & mesquite flavoring. It was like a glass of charcoal and ice. There was no whiskey taste to be found. Super disappointing. My second round was Butler St Mezcal. I have no idea what the drink tasted like because the spice around the rim was so overpoweringly spicy that it was all I could taste for a couple minutes after taking a sip. We returned the drinks and were appropriately comped.   We went back to our original drinks as a replacement since we were a little nervous at the second round being so bad. These drinks weren't even recognizable as being the same as the first. They each tasted completely different than the first round of the exact same drinks. I could barely get through mine because it was so sweet.   All in all...our server was pleasant and the food was good. The atmosphere was relatively poor considering we couldn't hear one another over the Pussy Cat Dolls & Taylor Swift (really, guys?), and the drinks were a total disappointment. We won't be returning.",

With walls of brick and wooden floors, every sound that is made bounces back, so groups find themselves screaming at each other while having dinner.   2. Service: let's pick it up a bit. 10 minutes between the order for a drink and the delivery is too long, busy or not. Food was delivered in a timely way, but by runners, not the waitress, so this may have been a personnel issue.   3. Tone down the salt. Yikes! I've been enjoying the new styles of fries around town, and Industry is cooking them really well, with crispy on the outside texture. However, the amount of salt they threw on would have preserved me on a boat trip across the Atlantic to the Old World.   4. Nice draft list and creative cocktails. They don't fall short here. There's a mighty list of beers, bourbons and mixed concoctions. The variety is sure to please.   5. Great Nachos!",

    "text": "This is such a cool place.  It defiantly has the whole industrial almost steam punk feel going on.  The lighting is very cool old style bulbs that make you think Edison himself made and installed them.  The tables and chairs around the bar are metal.  This was actually my biggest complaint.   The small metal stools are about 8\" square and are just not comfortable at all.    The drink menu is massive.  There are something like 30 different beer on tap, mostly craft.  I tried the house ale and was surprised at how good it was.  It tastes darker then an ale, but really smooth with an almost sweet hoppy after taste.  Very well done.  I also had the pleasure of my first of the season pum-king ale.  It's better this year!  Not as heavy, it's more bright and the aroma is amazing hints of pumpkin and ginger.  The liquor menu is also rather large, with plenty of different kinds of whiskey, scotch, and tequila to pick from.  We tried the smoke stack house bourbon and were very impressed.  Let's face it, fire makes anything better and that's True for this little gem.  They pour your shot, place a screen and wood chips over top, light the chips then let the smoke infuse with the whiskey.  It was amazing.  A must try.  I also tried a mixed drink on the menu called hair of the buffalo.  Came out like a mojito and I enjoyed this as well.    The food actually disappointed me.  I got the \"beastloaf.\"  It's a beef and sausage mix meatloaf that was bland.  The herbed gravy was bland.  The mashed potatoes were bland.  Are we seeing a theme here?  I think I got screwed here because I tried the better half's burger and it was really tasty, so take that for what you will.   It's also worth noting service was excellent, the waiter really knew his menu, and everybody seemed really friendly.  All in all I enjoyed my experience and I'd come back with friends.  Nice job, public house!",

    "text": "I've been here once, and it was only for drinks, so I can't comment about the food they serve.  I tend to hesitate to go out to the bars in Larryville because I don't feel nearly young or hipster enough to fit in there. Nevertheless, I recently found myself out at Industry Public late one night with some friends.   The positives: Love the industrial decor here. Cool lighting fixtures, exposed brick walls, giant garage door windows. I thought it had a very modern, hip vibe, while still feeling welcoming.  The negatives: Drinks were super expensive and not great. When we sat at the bar, I asked the bartender to recommend an interesting drink that doesn't taste overwhelmingly like liquor. He said he would concoct something for me, and came back with a margarita (how uninventive!) But apparently it was his \"special\" margarita, and he went on and on about how he makes the best margaritas, yada yada yada. Well, it didn't taste like a margarita...it tasted like straight up tequila (maybe that's why he thought it was \"special\"). But I'm not a fan of straight up tequila. So boo for that. My mistake for not being more specific in my order, I guess, but at places that are known for their drinks, I like to let the bartenders be creative and discover new things. Serving a drink that tastes like nothing but tequila to someone who specifically asked for a drink that's not too heavy on the liquor taste definitely doesn't speak well to this bartender's skills.  A bit later, I flagged down another bartender after our first one started ignoring us (it started to get busy and service became spottier as the night went on). Again I thought I would allow the bartender some creativity. I asked her to make me any tasty drink with grapefruit juice. I have no idea what she made, but she came back with a drink that was unpalatable. I couldn't discern anything in the drink (not even the grapefruit juice), but whatever ingredients were in it did not work well together. Blech!! It was so nasty that I couldn't even pawn it off onto one of my drinking companions (and one of the friends I was with has been known to drink just about anything, so that goes to show just how gross this drink tasted).  My friends' drinks were not much better. One friend ordered one of their specialty drinks with flambeed rosemary, which looked a lot more interesting than it tasted. On the whole, we ended the evening each having ordered two subpar-to-mediocre drinks, and the bill was pushing a hundred bucks for the four of us. Yowza, next time I think I'll just directly flambee my wallet instead and save myself the trouble.",

You don't tell people who have a complaint that \"two other people ordered it today and nobody said anything to me about it.\" Some people may just suck it up and eat just because they're hungry, and just not order that again, or not ever come back. I've had plenty of fried fish all over Pittsburgh and this is the first time I've run into a beer battered fish that simply had no salt at all. Not in the batter, or on the fish. Totally bland, and very oily on top of that. Also they completely forgot to put dressing on my salad even though the menu said it was tossed in it, and the waitress didn't ask me for burger doneness. To even ask about any of this, I had to get up and find our waitress since she didn't come back to check on us for quite some time. Thankfully the burger still came out okay (if a bit more done than I prefer, since I like to order it medium rare and it had a medium well tag stuck in it), and I'm glad the fish and chips was taken off the check; these are honestly the only reason this isn't a one-star review.   I don't know what went wrong since I've been here plenty of times in the past and the food and service have both been great, but I really don't appreciate being treated like we don't know what we're talking about when it comes to food.",

    "text": "Some of Kay's friends from Virginia were in Pittsburgh for medical reasons, and to express their gratitude for providing them with room and board at our home, they decided to treat us to dinner on a humid Friday evening. Being that Industry Public House is blocks from my place of employment and that we haven't stopped in yet, I figured it was as good a choice as anything else in the city.   One could argue that Industry Public House is somewhat redundant with the similar New Amsterdam within shouting distance, so I'm not sure Lawrenceville \"needed it\" as another reviewer suggested, but considering its overall quality, it's welcome to stay.   It's hard for me or anyone else I know to pass up truffle fries when they appear on a bill of fare, so the four of us shared a serving.   IPH calls them Truffled Filament Fries (one can also have them Loaded or Pot Roast style). I call 'em \"pretty good.\" Along with that occult and controversial oil of fungus (that angry bastard Gordon Ramsey hates the stuff), the well-fried spud staves are adorned with Gorgonzola cheese, sage, and rosemary, making them all the more arcane (if humble french fries can be so), not to mention rich. I probably would have preferred the cheese to have been melted more, but immaterial of that, we all savored them heartily, even if I don't feel they matched up to that which Meat and Potatoes offers.   I TRIED like hell not to order a burger, but when I discovered that I could upgrade a certain one with \"sweet lobster and garlic aioli\" (speaking of redundant, is that a redundant term, 'garlic aioli?'), I felt I could achieve a compromise of sorts.  The Caribbean Burgher is centered around a patty constructed of ground chorizo and pork with a \"jerk bbq baste\" and a sort of relish or compote (?) called \"sweet pineapple calypso mojo\" along with the standard lettuce, tomato, and \"housemade\" pickle.  For the most part, to me the carmine burger was a success with its head-on crash of sugar and spice, but I felt the burger itself could have used a bit more ampage on both counts. It was filling and tasty enough, but I would have liked the flavors of the entire thing to have been larger than they were. The fragmented lobster claw almost became lost in the Santeria going on inside the strong bun, and the garlic mayonnaise was served on the side.   Our quartet tackled the Coconut Milk Cake for dessert. Its whipped cream frosting held toasted coconut shavings and would have served as a tremendous sundae topper. The discs of poundcake were divinely dense and absorbed the percussive ecuatorial essence of both the lemon and mango purees.   Kay and her childhood chum Renee shared some Pot Roast Sliders that contained within a potato roll the following elements: pot roast, sauteed onions, and mashed potato wafers. I had a taste and was astonished at how something associated with traditional Sunday dinners could be made into something cutting-edge, not to mention convenient and appetizing.  The spacious interiors of brick and wood are arranged such that I thought we had wandered into a sushi bar instead of a New American pub and grill. Regardless of IPH's poshness, there's a very casual vibe at hand, and the service was as friendly and enthusiastic as it was competent. I suspect that the staff knows they've gotten in on Floor One of an exciting establishment with an effulgent future.   I'm not sure what Industry Public House was before it became a restaurant and bar, but I do appreciate what it has become. May IPH and New Amsterdam forge a most wonderful rivalry that lasts long after all the neighborhood hipsters have approached middle-age.",

My boyfriend and I have varied tastes in dining and tonight was for him.  I'm not a meat eater or a whiskey/bourbon lover.  He was practically drooling over the massive beer list.  He ordered the chicken and dumplings off the features listing, and I went with the pumpkin ravioli.   Mine was good but not great.  I think it's the kind of place where you go for a sandwich or burger not homemade ravioli.   And to be honest, I'd go more for the beer and cocktails than the food.  I had the rhuby, rhuby, rhuby.   Sweet and delicious.  Also, had the Tesla's Coil, which was a bit too strong for me.  Our waitress knew the extensive menu impressively well and made some great drink recommendations.  Service dropped off a bit as the meal progressed due to some large groups coming in but overall a good experience.",

    "text": "Let us start yesterday evening.  Here I was, inside my apartment, comfortable on my couch.  I was on my laptop whenever a noxious smell caught my nose which distracted me from the task at hand: catching up on work.  Trapped in this miasma, I realized my eyes have grown dull from the glare of the laptop screen.  A wisp of introspection curated a revaluation of how I spend my spare time.  My mind was set.  I am going to the casino.  After fumbling around my couch for my phone, I finally find it.  I attempt to pick it up, but the grease from my fingers makes it fall from my hand and into the cushions of my couch.  Defeat.  Now fighting an uphill battle, I frantically pull it up out of the cushions and fire up the Uber app.  I request my ride.  Then, like a guardian angel from heaven, a heavy-set man with a myspace-angled selfie, Lawerence, was on his way to save me from the tragedy and perils of time mismanagement.  I climbed upon his faithful steed in which he called \"Pontiac\" -- we rode west.  We arrive at the casino.  Upon entering the casino, I was immediately overcome by its energetic atmosphere. The lights, the sounds, the money.  My eyes glew green.  I headed over to a Blackjack table where I was greeted by the dealer, a man named \"Khem\" of an exotic descent.  What was about to happen would change my life forever.  He begins to deal the first hand and in a flash of hits and stands, I found my self with a five-card 21.  What happened?  Not only was my victory secured, but to my surprise, I also won a free t-shirt.  White, extra large, and with \"CHEERS TO FIVE YEARS\" written on the back.  I am in love.  Fast-forward.  I do well on the table, cash out my winnings, and head home to catch some sleep and bask in my triumph.  Next day, 8:00 am: I wake up.  The alarm on my phone rings like war drums.  Like a soldier on the front lines of battle, I am fearless, and my thumb strikes the \"off\" button with the precision of a trained sharp shooter.  I rub my eyes and they come into focus.  The rays of the sun pierce through my windows and illuminate my new favorite t-shirt.  The holy grail.  Excited, I quickly bathe, put on my new favorite t-shirt and run out to my car to begin my commute to work.  I am invincible.  I arrive at work and immediately everyone takes notice of my t-shirt - today is a good day.  12:00 pm: Lunch time.  After much squabbling and indecision between my deskmates and myself, we finally decide to just go to my car and start driving.  I am determined to find a place to spend my casino winnings while wearing my new favorite t-shirt.  A left turn, a right turn, another left turn - we dive head-first into an excursion of an uncharted frontier that would shake the likes of Lewis and Clark: Lawrenceville.  We park the car.  Unsure where we want to eat, we pilgrim the sidewalks until we discover our villa: \"Industry Public House.\" We walk in.  After being greeted by the hostess, she guides us to our table and we sit down.  Long story short: It took like 40 minutes to get our food and there was like, only four other tables there.  The food was all right, but seriously, 40 minutes, wtf?  I accidentally spilled some water on the floor.",

I've been here probably 4-5 times for happy hour & once for lunch & mostly recently for dinner. They have good craft beers, bartender attentiveness varies. I like their Buffalo Mac & Cheese flatbread, sounds weird but it's tasty. They have awesome truffle fries, but get the oil & cheese on the side to avoid overkill. Their burgers were good as well. Last night I had their steak salad which I enjoyed. Our server was great, I was meeting a friend I hadn't seen in years so we had lots of catching up to do & she didn't push us to order or finish quickly. It's definitely a place a take out of town guests for the cool vibe. Anyway, I'd definitely recommend stopping in for happy hour or just a drink & appetizer if you're cruising Butler Street.",

One would expect Industry to be a good choice for any type of occasion, especially accommodating for big groups.  We went for a friend's going away get together last Thursday night; I arrived after 9 pm. There were only 2 bartenders in the main area and no table service. Other than long wait times, I had to remind the bartenders at each contact for my previous requests. Prices are unreasonably high for the quality of food. I ordered the $15 soft pretzel with beer cheese; it was completely over-salted, dry, and unappetizing.   Overall another one of several poor experiences at a place that has all the bells and whistles of your typical gentrified neighborhood drinking spot. Will do my best to avoid from now on.",

They definitely could have put more mac and cheese on the flatbread. The chicken pieces were very small and there was barely any buffalo hot sauce.

    "text": "Writing this review as I am still waiting for my checks. It's a busy-ish Saturday night and while we were sat immediately, we waited entirely too long for every part of the dining out experience.  I don't know whether to blame the hostess or the waitress, but the service was terrible. We waited too long to order drinks, to order food, to receive our drinks, to receive our food, and to get our checks.   The food and drink selection, however, made up for it. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. I got a Porter beer and the Blast Pig burger. Reasonably priced for craft brew and a large, delicious burger, I was not disappointed.   I would certainly come back here, maybe for weekend lunch where the food is the same but the service has a chance to get better.",

The atmosphere was nice too. We were excited because we have been wanting to stop by....   The service was extremely poor on multiple occasions! We waited forever between drinks to even be noticed. The bartender told us drink prices when we asked specifically about two whiskeys, and apparently they were wrong. We had to ask three times for her to finally close out our tab, she kept forgetting. She was short with us and didn't really seem interested in serving us or really anyone for that matter. Very sad with the service here.   The alcohol selection was large! We had plenty of choices to pick from! Unfortunately, we won't be back and probably wouldn't recommend. We can't speak for the food though, it did smell good!",

Nice atmosphere and good crowd. Definitely will be back! Also love the Digital Pour app which shows you the percentage of beer left on tap. Super cool!  Update to original review- totally different experience this time. They had a bouncer carding people which was kind of annoying- it took the hostess forever to seat us. The food was good but the drinks sucked and service was extremely slow. For a $100 tab we expected better service. Maybe next time but it will be awhile before we go back.",

The old fashion was by far the best drink there and they have so many good drinks. The bartender smoked out the bourbon by setting it on fire. It was such a cool experience. It is definitely a modern twist on what is really considered such a hipster area. The crowd was a mix of 20s and 30s.  It got very crowded towards the end of the night but it was still comfortable.  This is one of my new favorite places.",

    "text": "First: this place has a lot of potential.  My experience was mixed, but it wouldn't take much to turn Industry Public House into a consistently awesome experience.  Pros: *The ambiance is fun.  It's a nice bar inside.  It's not to fancy, but not a dive either.  People have their space, and you could bring a date or a group.  *The bar is well stocked.  Some drinks are a little pricier, but others are fair.  I can't imagine someone not finding several drinks they like among the offerings (especially if you like whiskys, but there's plenty of alternatives as well).  *The menu has something for everyone.  And maybe more than one something.  It was hard to make just one selection.  *Good sandwiches.  I tried two, and they were both delicious.  In fact, I'm salivating for want of another sandwich just typing this review (and I take my sandwiches very seriously).  *Our server was delightful as well--friendly, knowledgeable, warm and welcoming.  Cons: *The service (and time to food delivery) was very slow.  I don't really blame my waitress, though, as they seemed to be quite understaffed.  Maybe it was a fluke, and maybe management doesn't keep enough people in the rotation.  If I go back and get more information, I'll post an update.  *The french fries were a disaster.  They seemed to be fresh cut, but mine were just drowning in grease and salt.  I could barely taste the potato, and I could only eat a few before downing an entire glass of water.  This should be VERY easy to fix, though, as soon as the kitchen is alerted to the problem (maybe even by reading my review...?).  *I think they could probably make more money by lowering drink prices in a few categories (like whiskys), as people like me would visit a lot more.  Right now I'd definitely love to return for maybe a sandwich and a beer, but I wouldn't want to spend a night of drinking at Industry Public House.  It would just cost more than comparable (or maybe even slightly better) experiences elsewhere.",

When you want to order a drink you have to battle to get the bartenders attention and if you order a complicated drink get ready for a dirty look.  The food is very bland with even simple things like boneless chicken bites tasting off.  I have heard rumours they are planning to expand hopefully they start taking advantage of some noise dampening because everything in this place reflects sound instead of absorbing it causing the sound of other peolpes conversations to grow to a roar on a busy night.  Since Tender has opened accrosss the street I see no reason to ever go to Industry again.",

You have created an overcrowded monster by concocting the perfect harmony of \"hip/ trendy\" with suburban, mainstream appeal (think good music, factory-esque hanging lightbulbs, eclectic beer selection + sports on multiple tv's and tacky bachelorette parties). The happy hour special ($2 off drafts and way cheaper food) is pretty spectacular if you can make it there on a weekday between 4:30-6:30pm.   Other than the happy hour, the food is good but pretty overpriced. I have had one catastrophic experience with an incompetant server who did not know how to use the computer system at her own place of work. I have since forgiven the establishment, but it will forever go down as the worst service I have ever experienced.   A++ for the \"Smokestack\" cocktail consisting of smoked, flavored woodchips over a bourbon of one's choice.    ***Be warned: this is the ultimate in Lawrenceville \"bridge and tunnel\" on weekends***",

    "text": "Industry Public House is a few blocks from my residence in Lawrenceville so my fiance and I like to stop in here when we don't feel like cooking and looking for a quick bite to eat.   Industry sort of has this Jekyll and Hyde persona. On weekdays and nights it is sort of low key, not too crowded, with people sitting at tables quietly eating dinner and some guests at the bar watching whatever game is on one of their 20 or so TVs. But on the weekend its an entirely different story. Industry is sort of following the trend of what I like to call the Butler Street weekend; tons of young drunks flocking in to the neighborhood from the universities and other nearby neighborhoods looking for places to party. On the weekends places like Industry pack them in and keep the party going.  That being said, my fiance and I prefer the former, but understand the Industry's need for the latter.   The food here is really good. Think bar food themes, but amped up with top notch ingredients. You can't go wrong with the Mac and Cheese, Pot Roast, and most of the sandwiches are top notch. The only entree that I have been slightly disappointed with has been the IPA battered fish sandwich which was slightly too salty.  On the bar side of things the beer list is top notch with lots of local brewery selections and the whiskey list is one of the better ones I've seen in the city.   The only issue that keeps Industry from getting 5 stars is the service always seems to be so-so. Nobody ever seems too excited to take your order and the waitstaff isn't always prepared to answer questions about the menu. Some of the bartenders are very personable while others not so much. By no means is the service terrible, but making a little extra effort on this front could raise Industry to a 5 star sorta place.",

The interior theme is also cool, if slightly hackneyed.  Had the wings and they were OK, over cooked somewhat, but otherwise good.  But then came the service.  Really annoying, employees more interested in each other than the customers.  All too cool to be bothered.  And that also goes to the management, which hovered and did their \"supervisor\"-thing with the employees, but didn't once scan to see how the customers were doing (would have found many empty drink glasses around the bar).  It never ceases to amaze me how talented some people can be at walking right past you and not engaging eye contact at all.  I won't bore you with the details, because I'm sure you've experienced similar.  Then I went to the restroom to find a large hoard of employees milling in the back, more interested in posing than actually doing anything.  I hope the restaurant scene in Pgh doesn't become too much of a \"scene\" as evidenced here. Remember restaurant owners and employees, it's not about you, a restaurant is a service business.

There isn't a bad seat in the house.  What I really love is the attention to detail on the food and bar menus. It's so sad when a place like this opens up and their menus fall flat. Industry has such a selection of 'artisan' bar food and drinks....including house-infused cucumber gin!

That will not be happening.   Let's start off with the menu. Mine had different prices printed than my friend's. The menus had identical printing volumes at the bottom. We pointed this out to our waiter, who said \"Which ever is higher priced is right!\" and we were all \"Oh, we weren't trying to get cheaper food, just thought you should be aware because people usually want to know what they are paying for food...\"   Which brings me to service -- I wanted to like our waiter, but he was kind of weird. I don't know if pushy is the right word, but he wasn't congenial and almost seemed annoyed by us not knowing what we wanted the second we arrived. I mean, for real he handed us menus and was like \"do you know what you'd like to order?\" when we very obviously didn't. He left and came back literally 45 seconds later. After we ordered, my friend's drink sat empty for 20 minutes before we saw the waiter again.  I guess here is where I should note that this place was not at all busy, so the drink sitting empty is really inexcusable. Also, for 10 people being in the space, it was incredibly loud. I get that might be a product of the space, but what MIGHT help is not having several TVs blaring different things.   And now food. I got pot roast fries. They danced right on the \"Wow, this is really salty\" and \"Wow, this is totally inedible\" line. My friend's parents joined us and I didn't want to be fussy and hold them up, so I said nothing. Had it just been my friend and I, they would have been sent back. I rarely think things are overly salted -- these fries appeared to be coated in coarsely cracked sea salt. When I got near to the bottom, I realized that the gravy on the fries had basically made the paper in the basket disintegrate or dissolve -- that's when I just stopped -- who wants paper with their fries? Not me.   And now for the TMI portion of the evening. I have a pretty strong stomach with no regular digestive issues. I had the absolute worst indigestion, gas, and bloating after eating here. Worse than when I was 9 months pregnant eating pickled jalapenos on eggs covered in hot sauce with black beans on the side. Seriously. They use something in their food that is not kind to tummies. Or at least mine.",

I've always sat at the bar and while the bartenders are friendly, they do not seem to be in any rush to serve people. I haven't tried much food here but from the looks of the dishes it seems like fairly good bar food, but if you're getting food at all - get the honey lime sriracha wings! They are some of my favorite wings in Pittsburgh. Outside of that, don't go in with many expectations and you'll get what you came for.",

The restaurant is always packed which is a great thing, but the noise level makes it impossible to have a conversation at a normal level. I felt like I was shouting across the table when I was in the main room, and even in the side room I was still shouting even though I thought it would be a little easier to carry on a conversation.   The restaurant has fun vibes and if you're going out just for a drink, it's great, since there's so much room, unlike many places in Pittsburgh, and you can fit a large group. If you're going out for food, I think it's a little pricey for the food you get. The classic burgers and sandwiches aren't anything special. There are better places to eat, even in Lawrenceville that are better worth my time. Will probably be back for drinks and the huge portion of nachos but if you're trying to have a conversation, this is not the place to go.",

    "text": "How I do have a love hate relationship with this place. One of the stars of butler street nightlife, IPH draws on the 'cool cats' trying to catch the hipsters neighborhood vibe and who decisively pay too much money to stand squished together in a cleaned up version of a carson street bar.   However, for the money you pay in the 10 minute increments it takes to get a drink, IPH tries it's hardest to make up for the fault of its patrons. First, it has a fantastic rotating draft selection of craft beers and the gimmick of a blow-torch smoked cocktail. At least you're getting a show for your wait.  Second, they try a lot with their menu. Starters, flat breads, burghers and entrees and a brunch menu gives the patrons a lot of pick from. Now the price point is typical pittsburghese, meaning that it's slightly better than average tasting, $$ priced for a 2x meal. I like that. You definitely need to practice constraint on your own and take home half of it. Surprisingly, the food is better after taking it come and eat it cold. Unfortunately, there are many subtle flavors that are lost when the food is hot [such as the mashed potatoes that have been cooked in bacon fat]. Of course you could always settle for one of their delicious and underrated salads, which are definitely my favorite.  Third, they hit the nail on the head with their specialty foods. This is where IPH truly shines and the culinary specialty comes out. I am sad to have missed out on  the pumpkin stuffed with ground lamb, it looked delicious!!! Also, don't dare miss out on their bloody mary's, they are pretty much spectacular. [I think they are tinged with fresh orange juice].  Best word of advice is to come here during non-peak hours that don't fall on a Friday or Saturday night, as to avoid all of the pretentious people as to enjoy a simple meal and stick with the beers or come for brunch.",

Many have mentioned the candied bacon, flat breads - all are great.  They have an awesome beer selection.    The service was crisp at first.     As with any new place, our waitress was over extended which caused long wait times for drink refills from the bar and delivery of our meals.  My meal (ordered the Industry Pot Roast)  was warm / not hot.  My second visit was with a buddy.    Service was on point.    Food / drink service was great.   Food was slightly over cooked (Management Burgher) but arrived hot (this was due to larger tables all around us for holiday parties - my assumption was the kitchen was backed up).   Everything had great flavor.  This is going to be a great restaurant.   I hope they modify their service a little to provide extra hands for the wait staff.     I will be back and look forward to this location to improve.   There is a much need in the local market (away from the chain restaurants the area is known).",

Everything about this space has such a modern and easy going vibe, it makes you want to take full advantage of its very visually appealing bar and have a few beers from the extensive tap list with which to slowly enjoy your meal.  Four of us were able to snag a corner table in front of the huge windows overlooking Butler Street.  I had an induction salad, and my partner ordered the Farmed Out Burger.  Forgive me for waxing poetic about a salad, but the zesty arugula was perfect with the tomato and watermelon chunks, which were plentiful.  It has ruined me for all other summer salads.  My S.O. enjoyed his burger, which was tasty in the way only cheddar and fried egg-topped beef confections can be.  It came out medium rare, as ordered (fearing overcooked meat, I never take this as a given).  Our friends greatly enjoyed their burgers and fries as well.  We thought this would be a great place to bring out-of-town visitors for a casual meal if you're not sure where else to go.  We'll definitely be back.",

The show makes the price tag reasonable, although at $10+ does warrant a \"once in a while\" label for me.  Second time was a Thursday evening at the end of \"social hour\" (4:30-6:30pm). I had one of the standard ciders they had on tap which came in an interesting glass (kind of girly, lol). The buffalo mac and cheese flat bread was half off and DELICIOUS! finally some good mac and cheese yummmm. Their other flatbreads looked pretty yummy too.

The first time I went, I only had cocktails. And what fine cocktails they were!  The cocktail list at Industry leaves NOTHING to be desired. Delicious!  I was amped to go back to try out the food.  A couple of friends and I went tonight and had a great experience.  Our server (Jason) was awesome - friendly, knew the ins and outs of the drink and food menus and was super quick and attentive. And adorable. I had the Smoke Stack which is a roast beef sandwich on grilled sourdough bread. It was so good! It had a nice horseradish sauce on it as well as some mozz cheese.  I was pleased as punch with the fries, too. Fresh cut and crispy.   I also have to mention that the prices were great. I got out of there for under $20, including tip (I had the sandwich, fries and a beer).",

Hangover city, but if you haven't experienced one yet, you need to get your ass to Industry immediately.    This is a smokestack:  Pick a bourbon of your choice.  I recommend something moderately price, non-bonded. Pick your wood chip smoke (mesquite, cherry, or apple.)  To assemble, 1.5-2oz of bourbon, .25-05oz of maple syrup, dash of Peychaud's bitters.  Strainer on glass, set wood chips, burn them til they smoke.  Cover with shaker, infuse for 2 minutes, then dump chips & drink into shaker, stir well, strain into glass.  Add a King Cube ice cube (big-ass ice cube that slowly melts.)  Congrats, you just made a kick-ass drink.  They also have an extensive amount of taps as well.  Their food, unfortunately, is still lacking.  Everything is made in-house, down to the sauces, but unfortunately it has all been pretty mediocre.  Not bad, but it doesn't hold a candle to the cocktails.",

The place is a huge u-shaped bar, with a handful of tables scattered about.   Although the number of TVs hinted that this is the place to watch sports in Lawrenceville, the drink menu suggested way more than sports pub.  They have 40 taps with several local brews and an impressive drink menu.  I ordered the Robber Baron, which is made with vodka, vermouth, pickle juice, and a pickle spear. Whoever thought this drink up must have been reading my mind.  It was a perfect cocktail for someone who loves pickles.  The boyfriend had a cocktail with cherry infused whiskey, which was just sweet enough to hide the fact that it was whiskey!  We ordered a flatbread with fresh mozzarella, basil, and roasted tomatoes.  The serving was small for the price, and didn't really resemble flatbread so much as a pita with toppings.  Despite that, the fresh toppings did not disappoint.  I hope they start posting their food and drink menus online.  I will definitely return for another pickle cocktail...I can't get anything like it anywhere else!",

    "text": "Industry is a new bar along Butler street. Having seen the layout in the windows for many months leading up to their opening, when I found out they opened I had to stop in and check it out. We walked in just before dinnertime and asked if they had a happy hour - they don't, yet, but assured me within a week they'd have one figured out. The hostess encouraged us to look at the food and drink menus, all printed on sheets that look like industrial part-order forms, each several pages long.    We had just gotten dinner at nearby St. Matthew's fish fry, so we weren't hungry, but decided we'd sit at the bar and grab a drink. The room is very nice looking, a wide open space with a very large bar in the middle, a somewhat open kitchen off in the back. Bright light shines in through the bay windows, but beautiful hanging light fixtures are all around the restaurant. There are high and low tables, semi-communal bench seating, and tables around the outside.   The bar contains a very large liquor selection, in addition to its 40 taps - 2 of them being house brews(With taps made of working lights). At the front there are many containers of various plant matter soaking in alcohol, which we found out was a Blood Orange-soaked Ketel One Orange, a Cucumber-soaked Hendrick's gin, and what ultimately wound up in my drink, a bing-cherry soaked Maker's Mark. What I ordered was essentially a manhattan made with this concoction - beautifully served in an oversized glass with a single, (nearly) crystal-clear, extra-large ice cube and a cherry. The taste was slightly sweet and with little bite, but the flavor of the cherry really came through and made it very pleasant to sip. The bartender told us about one of their sweeter drinks, the Confetti - something like a cake-flavored white russian with jimmies and a 'cake frosted glass'. What really interested me on the menu was the 'Smoke stack' - your selection of bourbon or whiskey with a touch of maple syrup and your choice of wood to infuse a bit of smoke into the drink.   While we didn't try the food, the bartender did encourage us to come back and try the bugers, advertising that they were pan seared in several varieties of rendered pig fat. The appetizers sounded quite good as well, along with things like truffe oil and gorgonzola fries, and several jerk-seasoned items.  The service was outstanding, especially given that they had only opened a day before. They were certainly well-staffed for it being early in the day, and the bartender was nice enough to talk to us about the place and how many of the items on the menu are made. The prices were on the above-average side, with both cocktails and burgers being in the $10+ range, and beers being in the $5-7 range. As I said, no happy hour just yet, but stay tuned - I'll certainly be returning to try the food(and more drinks!).",

    "text": "Another new place in Larryville? I may never leave this part of the city!  Industry, along with Tamari, is filling a voided niche that Pittsburgh so desperately needed. I have lamented the lack of upscale pub/ lounge environments in Pittsburgh that you can either go to for some quality drinks or delectable bites and not be surrounded by affliction shirt wearing bro's slurping up bud light (why is that the bro drink of choice? less calories more taste? or prep for the redbull and vodka to come).  Anyways, I was really excited to check this out yesterday. Upon entry, the place opens up spaciously with a nice vibe that suits the name. I love the open brick walls which pay homage to the city's roots, embracing an architectural heritage instead of absconding it. Another plus is the bar which is open and rectangular, as in you look at people instead of yourself in the mirror, which may prevent the vanity and or depression that comes with drinking. Might as well look at someone else and strike up a conversation, right?  The drink menu is extensive, with a respectable tap list of many favorites, and a bottle list to supplement that. To me, what stood out, is the cocktail list. This is what reminded me of Tamari, and what alot of Pittsburgh bars miss. They all sounded wonderful, and did not disappoint. I had the industrialist, as I love whiskey and all things manhattenesque. It was a solid drink that was worth every penny. My girlfriend had the Carnegie ( I think thats what it was called) with the gin and cucumber and it was also very tasty.  The food menu was also extensive, and each item looked like it was carefully thought out as to how it could be unique and flavorful.   She ordered the farmer burger, while I ordered the steakhouse sammich. As usual, she ordered better than I did. This is not to say my sammich was bad, it was quite delicious, with a generous helping of steak on a wonderful sourdough bun.   Her burger was simply smoky, juicy and delicious, and better than many of the \"burger\" themed restaurants that seemed to be the in thing for 2010-11.   I will return for cocktails, food, sports, basically any excuse.",

I'm currently trying to infuse this in my kitchen as we speak so I don't have to keep driving to Pittsburgh.  Seriously though their version of a Sazerac, while certainly not at all close to the classic, is definitely a fantastic cocktail.  Maybe one of my favorites ever.  Our food took a while to come from the kitchen (not an overly long time, though, and we were planning on having a few drinks anyway) but the manager came over and personally apologized for our wait and offered us a round of drinks on the house.  5 stars for customer service!   We tried several cocktails from the menu and they were all fantastic.  Quite a whiskey selection, as well.  I was slightly disappointed that the signature Smokestack seemed to be MIA from the menu the night we visited.  Just means we'll have to come back!",

I've been here 3 or 4 since it opened and have always enjoyed the cool, mature, sophisticated vibe here. I really enjoy the crowd that it draws in Lawrenceville, mostly younger professional people. The tap list here is quite extensive, and the variety and diversity of the liquor menu is incredible. You will find bourbons here that you probably can't find anywhere else in the city. I was actually here when the ball dropped on New Year's, and while the place was crazy, I still enjoyed the crowd and drinks, and the bartenders were still able to keep up (and even serve a free glass of champagne to everyone at the bar!). I have to say that I've never tried the food here, so I'm far overdue to sit down for dinner sometime. Unfortunately, it's become a madhouse on the weekends now because of novelty and word-of-mouth, so for a meal I'll definitely need to stop in sometime during the week. I love how this place has carved out its own niche at the perfect location on Butler.",

Hostess directs me, my wife, and my 10-year-old to the (3/4 empty) bar where we are immediately rousted with a \"no kids at the bar!\"  Discussion with the manager did not lead to any satisfaction:  they are happy to take our money as long as we sit ... there! Not there!  I suppose this might be a five-star review for someone objecting to sitting next to a 10-year-old (though he would have been pinned between us), but for us, it was clear that we were not welcome.  Fair enough: lots of other choices.  Ironic aspect: it was the 10-year-old who insisted on Industry due to the bacon appetizer. Families beware!",

She passes our table several more times and apologizes that we still don't have our food and that they will comp my wife's burger because it has taken so long.  No manager stops by to apologize, no appetizer offered because of our wait, nothing.  After one hour, we still have no food.  I guess it is easy to offer to comp food that you never receive.  We tell the hostess, on our way out, that we are leaving.  On our way home, my wife left a message for the manager to tell him or her of our experience, and no one returned her phone call.  I guess service isn't a big issue with this establishment.  We will make sure when we are in Lawrenceville next weekend for the Cookie Tour, that we will tell the shop owner that recommended this restaurant about the poor service we received and maybe save someone else from wasting their time.",

    "text": "Decided to try out Industry last night since we were in Lawrenceville for RANT.  We were a group of 6, who were seated within 10 minutes of arriving. The guys were excited by the extensive beer list.  We ordered our food pretty quickly and the two couples who ordered appetizers were thrilled. Everything went DRASTICALLY downhill from there.  About a half hour later, our waiter came back, took another round of drink orders and told us our food was up next.  After another half hour wait, when we never saw the waiter, we asked to speak with this manager.  This was AN HOUR after we put our food order in. The manager apologized, said they were slammed.  While the place was busy, there never appeared to be a long wait to be seated and many tables around us who were seated well after us had already received their food and cashed out.  The manager bought a round of beers for the guys and said they would get our food right up.  After another 25 minutes with no communication from our waiter or the manager again, we were in the process of determining what we owed for the beers so we could leave.  As we were standing our food arrived. The food was good, but after an hour and half wait, I think peanut butter on cardboard would have tasted good.   We had planned to check out some other bands and clubs but everyone was in a bad mood after the wait and the amount of time that we all headed home. I am certain we won't be back because after all, who has more than 2 hours to wait for a fairly average hamburger?",

We got there at about 7 on a Friday night and it was already at shouting-level. The sandwich board outside was advertising Southern Tier's Pumking, so we both got one - if I had realized it was $8 a pint (with both glasses about a centimeter below full), I would have gotten one of the myriad other craft brews on tap for $5-6. We weren't super hungry, so didn't get starters. My friend had a salad and I had the Management Burger. Our food came SO QUICKLY. This might be due to the tablet ordering (and payment) system - your card never needs to leave the table. I loved the burger - it was about perfect. Great bread, great meat, toppings all worked well, came with fries.  We hung out a while, chatting over beers, after our meals. There is a nice lively ambience here. There are screens with sports showing all the time, but they were unobtrusive enough. Some sound masking could make it even more pleasant.  Overall, a decent experience. I think I'll be back!",

It's not the second best burger in Pittbsurgh, which is probably Burgatory.  It would be a tough argument to make for number three, but I think it deserves consideration in the top five and easily beats out many of the places I have heard mentioned as having top five burgers like BRGR and Eleven.  The burgers are juicy and almost creamy.  They do a pretty good job, which most places don't, of actually giving me a real rare burger.  The topping are phenominal: great selection of high quality cheeses, great bacon and sauteed mushrooms and onions.  The bun is also good.  They also have fresh cut fries, which they do very well.  This is very important, since many places (BRGR for instnace) will hurt a good burger with fries that aren't fresh cut.  Also, if you are carb or health conscious, you can get your burger with a side salad, which I've done before.  Their salads are nothing special, but they use good field greens with a nice balsamic vinagrette.  The salad was only greens, which I thought was a fine complement to the burger.  I really like the Industry Public House Copper Ale, which they presumably brew themselves.  At $4 it's a fair price for a good craft beer.  I like the atmosphere, but the chairs are defenitely a little uncomfortable--Henry Clay Frick would not have been happy with having to sit on them.  When I was there last they had many televisions, but not one was playing the Buccos game!  I asked our waitress, who was very nice and receptive to my request, and the game came on several of the televeisions in a matter of minutes!",

It might not always be my first choice for a meal or night out, but you can never go wrong with it. It's a good fit for lunch, dinner, or a night of drinks with friends. The ambience is casual and in keeping with the neighborhood. The menu is diverse, but the emphasis is pub food or comfort food. I've tried multiple dishes and never regretted one. It will get crowded, but it's a big place that can generally accommodate the flow of people. For drinks, their beer selection is always fantastic, and if you're a whiskey drinker, be sure to try their signature cocktail, the smokestack (your choice of whiskey infused with smoke from one of three types of wood chips). Again, not always my first choice, but a worthwhile Lawrenceville staple.",

Anyway, the beer list was pretty extensive (as a pub should be), and the food had high aspirations. I and a few others ordered the pumpkin pierogies, and I'm sad to say that they were over priced for what you get and under-delivered on flavor.  A few ladies opted for one of the mac and cheese bowls, and those seemed to be universally liked. (Massive portions on that, too.) Overall, it was a fine experience.

Mind you, there were maybe 15 cars in the parking lot and a sea of empty tables once inside. The first hostess bopped by, made eye contact and asked how many...then walked away, and never returned. Then, another girl appeared who eventually turned out to be our server and again asked how many while she stood there staring at her chart. Finally, the third girl approached and AGAIN asked how many. The two girls stood there and proceeded to talk...not caring that we were within ear range and it was coming off as we were an inconvenience to the entire staff for coming in. I at one point asked them if they were closing soon because it was apparent they did not care about our business and would rather us go elsewhere. She assured us that they were no where near closing and took ad to the smallest table in the restaurant. Rewind to when I said the hostess was our waitress...well, we sat and waited after our hostess sat us to only return later as our waitress.  To get to the point: husband ordered a side salad and a handheld. I ordered the coconut shrimp. Everything took awhile to come out and came out together. Husband was a little turned off that he had to eat the sandwich first so it didn't get cold. The bread was burnt on the edges and hard to chew, it had the thinnest layer of horseradish sauce you could imagine and the blandest shaved beef we have ever tasted. The coconut shrimp was borderline burnt and tasted like the furthest thing from coconut, the plantains tasted like they were oil soaked,and the summer couscous-very poor quality if we are being honest. I will not be back unless it's just for the drafts as they seem to a lot to offer!",

It went from dark purple -- to pink! It was good! And pretty :) Totally made up for the unavailable drink on the menu ....   I ordered a burger, duh. The blast pig burgher -- well done. It had delicious candied bacon, candied jalapeno, caramelized onion, fried zucchini. BOMB. the patty was fat! And the bun was buttery .. just the way I like it.

We were seated immediately and told our waiter would be there soon. He quickly brought over our waters and introduced himself. We had told him that we were on a tight schedule and had to be out by 6:50 and he was so understanding of that. He immediately put our order in and also made the kitchen aware that we were on a time crunch. Our waiter even brought over our checks & boxes before the food came out to speed up the process. We waited maybe 12 minutes and our food showed up. Everything was right and wonderful! I had ordered the Fish & Chips and I was so taken aback by how big this piece of fish was! The dish came with a side of fries and coleslaw with a piece of fish. The fries aren't my favorite but they're ok! The coleslaw was finely shredded which I love. The fish was so crispy on the outside and nicely cooked on the inside. The sauce that came with it was phenomenal!  Overall, I was impressed with our service, how quick and attentive to our needs our waiter was, and how delicious the food was! I definitely will be returning.",

They often complain that it's too loud, and indeed sometimes it is, but they'll keep coming back with me since there's decent burgers, wraps, and fries. The food is fine, I've definitely had better elsewhere - but I've also had worse.  The drinks make it worth it, and the fries are good.  Last time I was there, on a Tuesday, the wait for food after ordering was over 35 minutes (dropping it down to 3 stars from 4)... I probably would take a break and not come back for a while.. but I'm sure it'll be the only place I'll get my family to agree on for our next family outing.",

    "text": "I've had multiple terrible experiences here.  The service is so poor that the food is not even worth it.  I will say that the food is good, although slightly overpriced.  The happy hour specials are really good.  Still not worth it.    On one occasion I came with a group of seven people, 3 of which were in from out of town.  It was a nice day and the windows were open.  We got seated next to the windows, which was perfect for our group.  We had all planned on catching up over drinks and lunch.  Drinks were ordered and in front of us, then we placed out food orders.  At this point, a person (who never introduced herself or who she was) came over and asked us to move our whole table in the middle of our dining experience.  She had stated that they had a reservation at this table who had requested to sit near the windows.  If that were the case, then she should not have sat us here to begin with.  I stated that no, we would not pack up our whole table, drinks, belongings and move to another table.  This is incredibly rude that she would have the audacity to even ask.  She had left, then our server came up to us and apologized and asked if we would like to speak to a manager about our experience.  I told her that yes we would.  The manager never came over.    On another occasion, my partner and I decided to go to industry for drinks and dinner during happy hour.  We sat at the bar, which actually was maybe only 1/4 full because we got there right at the beginning of HH.  We started with drinks and a flatbread which were on happy hour pricing, but had intended on each of us getting an entree.  So we received our drinks and our flatbread was delivered by a food runner.  The bartender did not make eye contact for the whole time we were sitting there until our drinks were finished and our flatbread was gone.  We could not get his attention to put in our food order.  He then proceeded to ask if we wanted our check.  He never came to get our dinner order, another round of drinks, or even to ask if our flatbread was okay.  We cashed out and went somewhere else for dinner.  There are other countless occasions where the service is just awful.  Unfortunately this place is in our backyard, so we've gone there too many times.  I don't recommend it to anyone.",

But they seemed well-staffed with 3 bartenders at the main bar. After we ordered our first beer we were completely ignored for the next hour or so. The 2 female bartender mainly stayed at one end of the large bar. They continued serving the same group over and over, and didn't even look at our end where 5-10 guys sat with empty glasses for an hour. Tried waving and even asking, but they didn't bat an eye and walked past us just to run bills for the patrons at the other end. 3 bartenders only attending to one corner of a packed bar? C'mon. That's why I left \"ZERO\" as my tip on the one beer I guess I was fortunate to get.",

And when we asked about it we were told it had kicked but did we want another beer. Let me think...yes, I'm at a bar and ordered a beer... Of course I want another beer. Then we were done eating at least 20 minutes with no one ever asking how things were. Empty beer glasses apparently aren't a clue that we might want more. Very Disappointed",

The kitchen does take a while before they get to your order, but the service is pretty good. The food is a typical American pub style food. It's nothing out of the ordinary other than the size. It's Definitely a place for groups during happy hour. We ordered a pretzel, nachos, fries and food. The pretzel was literally bigger than my face! It was cool since it also came with 3 dripping sauces: mustard, cinnamon sugar, and something else. They also have vegetarian options so your friends with food restrictions can pop by too. My opinion is that this place seems to be a popular trendy restaurant where young people meet and bond over beer on tap.",

I always vary my drink choice, because they have a nice beer selection on tap and a pretty solid bourbon selection. However, with the happy hour special being half off flat breads, I always get the Buffalo Mac and Cheese Flatbread. I have always received great service every time I've been to Industry and it's never been too crowded. I usually stop by on a weekday around 5:00-6:00. What intrigued me the most about Industry was their Smokestack drink. If you are going to try one of these, make sure you get a mid-lower end bourbon. The smokiness is definitely interesting and they have a variety of different wood chips that add different flavors. Give it a try if you're a bourbon person.",

Luckily I took it upon myself to find a seat at the bar, and I am so thankful because I would have missed out on a really good time had I not.  My whiskey and coke was made well. I love how it's not the typical bartenders there. Both my bartenders were men, and they knew how to mix drinks. I saw them lighting drinks on fire, finely peeling oranges, shaking up margaritas..I was impressed.  The nachos. Oh my, those nachos were some of the best I've had in my life! I was thrown away. I would absolutely recommend any group or single going to this establishment to try out their nachos. My goodness. So good. The couple next to me saw mine, and decided on some oftheir own... They also thought they were yummy. The pico de Gallo they put on it, by itself, is just so delicious. This place got it right! It deserves the business it gets.",

I have been on multiple occasions for both drinks and food and have been pleased each time.  The space itself is quite large, but it fills up quickly in the evenings and especially on weekends. Recently, we went to celebrate my birthday and had to leave as the wait to be seated for dinner was over one hour at 7pm. Not ideal, but understandable. For a night out, the bar can become very crowded very quickly and it can be difficult to find seating.   The food is excellent and their apps are filling. Nachos are the way to go for something that pleases everyone.  I visited for lunch as well and was not disappointed in their Bloody Mary's! The drink selection is unique and not your typical mixed beverage. It can be a bit pricey but worth it to try a few of them.",

They serve craft beer - in large quantities and with a huge selection!! Over 40 on tap and I'm in heaven sitting there staring at the varied taps, trying to decide what I need next. Notice I said NEED, not want. Yeah, I need. And they fulfill my need quite well here! With their own Industry Public House IPA (YUM!) and a great mix of East End drafts, it's hard for me to get too far down the row of taps.  I know they have imaginative cocktails but I don't go there - I do beer. Period. So my review can't address those amazing sounding concoctions that others have referred to in their reviews. I trust they're accurate. But I can tell you that the beer is awesome. And, the atmosphere is so cool! HUGE central bar, brick walls, amazing space indeed. Hard not to love it there. And the food? Oh yes, I've certainly indulged! All that drinking tends to make me hungry! Sure, they have the expected selection of wings, build to order nachos,  even chorizo and jalapeno chili. Great salads and terrific sandwiches including a tasty shaved ribeye. But their \"burghers\" are what I gravitate to. And yum, they are awesome with some unusual topping choices. Want wild boar bacon? No problem. How about brussel sprouts, bacon and gorgonzola? You got it! I love the Outsourced Burgher with habanero jack cheese, roasted pablano and jalapeno peppers with some tasty lime aioli - you won't be sorry.  Love this place!",

Very messy but pretty delicious. Unless you like spicy, order it without the jalapenos they were super spicy! My brother got an amazingly small crab cake sandwich. It was delicious but a bit small. My mother got a chicken salad sandwich, it was a bit big but came with a side of fresh delicious fruit. Here comes the worst, I got the master lunch grilled cheese. It has Ramona, Muenster, and Parmesan cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, bacon chutney, and a balsamic vinegar. I know what you're thinking, mmmmmm or delicious, me too,but nope. I ordered it without balsamic vinegar and was excited for it. When it came out it had no bacon chutney and a lot of balsamic on it. We sent it back and everything was okay. But when came out again I tasted it but nothing tasted right. I set it aside and my mom tasted it and said it was okay but when my dad tasted it he really did not like it. Now for the service. Spoiler, it was terrible. We were there almost 3 hours, we sat there waiting for a waitress to get our drink orders for about 10 minutes. When we finally ordered them we said we were ready to order and the waitress said okay and then just walked off. When she came back she took our orders and then we said that we needed more water, she said okay then walked off without our <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fglasses.my&s=7f4a7bbc3f4edbe4cbed013e0725579dcc5f6e2591354ea8331a746006b6b0a3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">glasses.my</a> dad got up with his drink glass and then my dad got up and filled up his glass himself. After that I got up to go to the restroom. There are windows in there so people can see you. They also had cracks in the bathroom sinks so water would drool out of them. This was a 1 star experience and I would rather not go there again.",

Or the pumpkin beer with brown sugar on the rim of your cup.  Better yet, check online to see which of your favorite beers are on tap before you come!!",

    "text": "Hipster Lawrenceville strikes again! I actually consider this place a 3.5, but yet again yelp has not made half stars an option (hint hint). I ordered the burger with cheese, an egg and bacon. Some places call it the farmers burger or the good morning burger, but no matter what you call it, this is all time favorite burger combo of mine and it's always interesting to see what different places do with it. Kind of a Pepsi/Coke cola challenge if you will. It was good, but I could have been sitting in Dive or Yard and had the same experience. They say the bacon is wild boar or something, but it just tasted like bacon.  The BF ordered the smoke stack sandwich and it was very good. It's a ribeye sandwich with arugula and horseradish, and I HATE horseradish, but I would totally order this sandwich next time. The arugula and horseradish gave it an interesting bite. I got the regular fries with mine, but he upgraded to the pot roast fries. Now, anyone who has read any of my reviews know I am a French fry elitist. And hand cut are always, always the best. These were hand cut but I found them to be a bit weird. They were kind of thick and dry. The BF's were better because of the pot roast, but because of my intense French fry love, they were docked 3/10s of a point or so. (a nod to the Olympics!)  Our waiter seemed newish and it was so cute to see how hard he was trying. And for the record, he was great. The prices were on par with similar establishments as well. A word of advice though, if you go try to get a table in the front window. The people watching is awesome; it is Lawrenceville after all.",

I got a pulled pork sandwich, and it was the best I'd ever had. The BBQ sauce was a little different but so delicious, and the crunchy onions added an amazing texture.

As it was happy hour for food, too, I ordered an \"Entry Level Burger\" that came out exactly how I ordered - rare.

    "text": "I have wanted to eat at industry for awhile now and finally had the opportunity to this afternoon for lunch. We sat at the bar And waited a good ten minutes before being acknowledged but honestly we were not in a hurry so although I don't think that's great customer service, we were not going to make a big deal of it. We both ordered the industry IPH (it's an IPA) which priced at 4.50 is one of the cheapest (and strongest) beers on the menu. If you like IPAs I'd highly recommend trying this. As for the atmosphere I really dug the industrial vibe-the bar was a really nice stained wood and the chairs were metal and of the \"modern\" look. As for food we shared two flat breads- the BBQ chicken and the buffalo Mac and cheese. My boyfriend ALso had a cup of the soup of the day-loaded potato. When he asked the bartender what was In the soup she shrugged and said she didn't know but it tasted good this morning. Well he says it was very tasty but I think any server or bartender should know what's in the soup of the day. The BBQ chicken flatbread consisted of chicken, bacon, fontina, and BBQ. It was a (very small) 4 cut pizza which is why we then ordered another pizza to split. And yes I'd categorize these as pizzas and not flatbreads as advertised. Although small it was tasty and each piece was loaded with ingredients. The buffalo Mac And cheese pizza consisted of buffalo sauce, buffalo chicken, and Mac And cheese. It was not overly spicy but had a nice kick . The Mac And cheese was excellent. Each of the 4 pieces was rich with ingredients. While this was also tasty nothing we had was really memorable . I'd like to come back and try some of their sandwiches or a burger. Also we saw someone getting a smoke stack while we were getting ready to leave and it looked very interesting- whiskey, various flavors, then smoked with wood chips. I'd give this place another try but I'm not rushing back.",

I recently moved from San Francisco to Pittsburgh and until I had that burger had been unimpressed with the food.  Today I had a Bloody Mary that tasted more of hot pepper than anything else.  Other than the picante, it was bland.  I ordered the pot roast.  It came layered with a gloppy gravy on the bottom, then bland mashed potatoes, followed by bland, slightly dry pot roast all topped with crispyish onions.  Typically pot roast is cooked in its own juices and I was expecting that over the meat and potatoes.  On top of everything, the service was quite slow especially considering that the place wasn't very full.  I hope the burger is more representative of the food at industry rather than the pot roast.  Not sure if I'll eat here again.",

For Lawrenceville, it's a very modern and mainstream bar experience. There are about 6 flat panels, and all were showing sports when I was there on a Saturday night. The clientele is very un-Larryville as well. I find none of this to be a problem, but it's certainly not the typical \"hipster\" experience many think of having on Butler St. The staff and feel try to replicate that of an off-kilter place, but at it's heart, IPH is a very nice bar that almost feels out of place.",

Are you in yet? This is a great bar with upscale bar food. If you like bourbon you definitely must try the Smoke Stack. It's an absolute show stopper.   I've tried many of the new burgers joints in town. My favorite is Wingharts but industry comes in second for me - over others like BRGR and Burgatory. The Farmhouse is my go-to. I always love a burger with an egg on top.   Other tip in food - the nachos are made with real cheese, not nacho cheese sauce. This is always a big one for me.  Lastly - on the ambiance and decor. It gets really loud in there so be ready for that if you are on a date. Some tables it can be hard to have a conversation at.   And second, I really like the industrial decor and exposed brick. They've for a great setup for TVs if you are trying to watch a game.",

The husband had a smokestack, which is so cool--they actually infuse smoke into whiskey with a flaming wood chip.  (Don't try this at home, kids.)  I had the Industrialist, a cherry-infused bourbon, which tasted mostly of regular old bourbon to me.  I wouldn't get it again.

Perhaps they are under-staffed, and lack experienced management and wait staff. Our wings were served cold and were average at best.

Fantastic beer selection, only thing keeping it from a 4 star was the sometimes longer than usual wait for your drink and the fact that the side salad I got with my sandwich was literally just lettuce.  Really, just lettuce and dressing.  For some reason this really bugged me.",

I like the feel of this place and let me just tell you they make awesome cocktails!  I had the Menlo Park (gin based drink with rosemary) - I was blown away by how good it was and how strong it was!  Even though you could tell it was strong, the taste was well-balanced between the gin and the rosemary.  I'm giving this place 4 stars on the drinks alone b/c I was disappointed in my meal.  I had the Worker Burgher which is a fairly simple burger with caramelized onions, tomatoes, mushrooms, and cheese.  I ordered it medium-well and it was prepared exactly as ordered and with all items as stated on the menu, but it wasn't that flavorful.  Maybe I just picked a bland burger from the numerous choices on the menu...but I couldn't get over it.    I'm not much of a burger person so when I order one it has knock me off my socks to impress me.  And while you could tell the meat was quality as were the ingredients it needed something...maybe some garlic, salt, or Mrs. Dash's seasoning in the ground meat mixture, but it was screaming for flavor...or maybe that was just me screaming at myself for ordering a bland burger.  I would definitely go here again and give the food another chance, but the drinks were awesome.    Oh I forgot, we had nachos as an app...that should tell you something they were forgettable - nothing that great.",

It was impossible to get a smile from a single employee in the building. I ordered the Rhuby drink. The first one was delicious, but the second round was much sweeter and I couldnt finish it. The Shroom flat bread was amazing. My chicken sandwich and buffalo mac & cheese was great. My friend's turkey sandwich and truffle fries were also good. But the lack of friendly or attentive service or even a simple smile was disappointing. The bar was not very busy and the half the restaurant was closed.

Making them exceptional is an art, sure, but use any kind of decent beef and it'll taste good. That means they're using sub-standard beef and trying to mask it with fancy dressings.   Their cocktails are wildly overrated. Oh, so there's smoke in it? Cool - if it didn't just drift away instantly. Their draft list is impressive, but the place is so packed and loud that you can't enjoy it. The design is nonexistent, and whatever cool the brick walls and edison lightbulbs contribute is obliterated by the gigantic TVs covering every conceivable surface. Another instance of a sports bar masquerading as a gastropub, only with terrible food.  I also know it's not really fair to judge a restaurant by its clientele, but the day that Industry opened, the tenor of that stretch of Butler street changed. Now on Fridays & Saturdays it feels like the South Side, and not in a good way, with loud drunken arguments and dudes arguing over parking spots.  I will say that the staff has always been very pleasant, so good for them. But this place is the worst, and it makes me fear for the future of Lawrenceville (and Pittsburgh) when this is the kind of restaurant that succeeds here.",

Drinks aren't too pricey because they are bringing in a certain atmosphere and technique to how they craft and serve their drinks.

My first couple of visits, I was excited by the awesome atmosphere and drink menu, but the food and drinks were a little expensive and the food was just OK - I was worried it had a little bit of a chain-like vibe, even though it's not.   But after my visit last night, I concluded that Industry is getting better with time.   I wanted to try one of the burgers, made with a veggie or turkey patty, and was disappointed to find this wasn't an option. But their menu has many other options, and I chose the Foster's Chicken sandwich. It was delicious - great flavor, juicy chicken, and wasn't too greasy. My friend got a burger, which was unique and looked great. In summary, I would describe their menu as your traditional bar-food menu with a unique twist that seems slightly healthier (or as healthy as bar food can get, I suppose) and good quality.   Our service was good, and the drinks and atmosphere are great. It's cool that they have TVs for sports, since there aren't many sports bars in Lawrenceville.  I love all the beers on tap, and they have a wine list as well as an extensive craft cocktail list and infused liquor.  Try the Carnegie Cucumber, and make sure take a bite of the gin-soaked cukes (but prepare yourself)!   I'm ready to go back already!",

Our waitress took about 15-20 minutes to come to our table to take our drink order however it was very crowded with many parties getting seated at the same time. She apologized profusely claiming there was a mix-up with servers and made up for it the rest of the night. The beer menu has a great selection of drafts and bottled beer. I choose Blue Point Pumpkin and the waitress was kind enough to ask if I would like cinnamon and sugar on the rim-yes please!

The service and food left something to be desired. However, the waiter was still tipped over 25% on the tab as I don't believe in poor gratuity on a such a large check after being in a restaurant for that period of time.   My experience:   The restaurant wasn't busy but I wouldn't say it was slow. Our service was sub par for the first hour or so which caused us to miss the appetizer special while we waited for the rest of our party to join us. We were going to let them know about this but didn't because we typically aren't a group to complain. No big deal at this point.  Ordered a bottle of wine and a beer. No problem. Appetizers came, Pot Roast fries and Bacon. All good. Slightly salty, livable. We contained to carry on and enjoy the evening.  We were sat at an 8 person table with an initial party of 3 and then asked to move to a smaller table to free up the larger table for a larger party. We obliged but the waiter changed his mind about moving us so we stayed where we were seated. Shortly after we advised him that another couple would be joining us to make a total of 5 people so the table dilemma was over. At this point, still okay, not a big deal but maybe a little unhappy.  Service got better at this point as the crowd died down.   At this point the party of 5 is all here. We all decided on another bottle of wine a few more beers and that appetizers will be the meals of the night. We order about every appetizer on the menu.   As we get through the menu, the food quality got a little worse and much more salty. The popcorn was bad, the crab cakes were small, oily and super salty. The flat bread was good with the tomato pesto and cheese was probably the best of the bunch. We have a buffalo chicken mac n' cheese flatbread that had under cooked chicken but the manager fixed that and didn't charge us (kudos)  Our thought on the saltiness was that it was an attempt to get us to drink more... maybe?? They do have a large amount of drafts on tap.   Overall the food was very subpar and doesn't live up to the menu. The beer and spirits section was great but the knowledge of that selection by the wait staff was very subpar.   The best par of the evening was after the meal we went to the bar to try the signature cocktail. The bartender was great at explaining the different Bourbons and Whiskeys. The smoked chips were a cool little show.   My final impression: Go there for the beer/spirits, not the food. Everything was overpriced for what we received. The space was nice but the feel wasn't all that inviting, The space was not all teh friendly nor was the crowd that the restaurant seemed to draw. But then again this is a hipster kind of place with a built in too cool for you attitude.",

When she finally stopped by we asked to make sure that she was in fact our waitress. Thought maybe that would help the amount of attention we got but service continued to remain pretty pour. Forgot to put drink orders in as well.   Might try to go back since it's close to home but the whole place just felt pretty \"meh\".",

I have to say since I have moved they have really built these neighborhoods up and this place is one of the new additions. It is a big restaurant all wood inside like a log cabin feel. We were seated immediately even though it was crowded. The only thing is it took a long time for our waitress to come to our table. The menu looked delicious and they had a lot of different dishes. From flat breads to salmon burgers. We got the chicken nachos for an appetizer and it was huge. Luckily it was three of us sharing it and it was very good. I ordered the brisket sandwich special and I wanted sweet potato fries but they ran out for the night. Which is a good sign that they make their own stuff. I was disappointed because I love my sweet potato fries!! Anyway the regular fries were good too you can tell they are made from scratch because they tasted like real potatoes. The brisket was good too but since I have moved down south I have had better brisket but this was fine for the pittsburger pallet lol. I also got a side salad which was $5 for like lettuce and a couple tomatoes not really worth it...overall a great restaurant very loud atmosphere so I would t recommend it for a first date lol",

I was really pleased when my friends booked it for an event, and was even more impressed when our hosts \"comped\" us when the plans changed, thanks to the \"Pittsburgh Young Professionals\" overwhelmed our meager table - hey, I won't complain... I got one of their trademarked SmokeStack beverages out of the deal.  I did, however, feel bad for our server, who had to keep running around and making sure that everyone had what they had wanted and paid for - Jesus - that's a drag.  Lose the \"bar\" feel, and jump on the \"restaurant\" train. Don't let people freeload and stiff the wait staff!!! If you do, I, myself, will patronize other places with our fellows and residents, because I think it sucks to get the short end of the stick!  Strive to be better! You have a lot of positive buzz - yearn for improvement!",

First time I went I sat down with a group that was already there for my sisters birthday just getting drinks, server came over once and asked what I wanted, when I said I wasn't ready to order, the server never returned and I had to go to the bar to order. Which was a feat itself.   Second time I went in, the bar was empty and I stood at the bar being ignored for 10mins while the bartenders had a lengthy conversation with another server. So I just walked out.  Third time I was dragged there by friends wanting to go there. We walk in and sit at an empty table, to be rudely told by a server that it was not ours to be had. So we walked right out the door.   I refuse to go back here and have only been told bad stories from other people that have gone.   My sister who is 26yrs old, was told her I.d. was fake and they demanded a second form of id which she gave and the bartender said that didn't work, so she even showed her debit card and they laughed at her and would not serve her.   Service alone is a reason to never come back. Never been served and i don't want to be by that staff.",

This was not in the nyt article, however, we were fortunate to have skated over to IPH for happy hour.   Drinks: the Barrel aged Manhattan was the biscuit in the basket. Smooth like a Zamboni, big block of ice, wicked puck (luxardo cherry). This drink was the power play of the game. Seriously, if we didn't have the 17 yo with us, we'd have gone three full periods with this drink and gotten a major misconduct. Thankfully, we didn't go into overtime.   Chili cheese fries were a slapshot. Chili was quality- not that Hormel stuff.  Fries solid like the puck hitting the goalies face mask. All in all a playoff win. No joke.",

We were seated quickly, and received friendly service right away.    I love how they do menus, it's super unique but clear and concise.  The selection was great, but I was feelin' Mac and cheese. The way they serve water us really unique - it's in a big glass bottle for you to open and refill as desired. The meal came out very quickly, and it was delicious. The gouda really shines, but what makes it special is the crispy onions on top. I don't even like onions, or much vegetables- generally they're the last thing eaten, and begrudgingly. These were so light and crisp, they were a perfect addition to an already yummy dish.   Price is also reasonable, with the Mac and cheese at 12, so in all we have a unique experience, tasty food, and a good price. My wedding anniversary is next month- I'm going to start dropping hints. :)",

We're told when we arrived they had no record of our reservation.  We asked to be placed on the list.  Went to the bar to wait.  Wait staff spilled a beer one of our guest.  We had to ask for a towel to clean her up.  They walked away and did not offer to refill the drink they spilled on her.  When we asked for a refill they were very hesitant.  One wait staff member spoke up and said she saw the other spill it.  So we moved to the other bar on the other side of the restaurant.  Went to check on our seat and saw they moved past us on the list and never called our phone like they said they would.  I asked for the manager and was told he won't talk to me because he is too busy, but yet they made no attempt to even asked him.  Then the hostess told a member of my party they don't need our f**ckin business and to leave.  The manager finally came over to offer us free drinks.  It was the most amazing display of disrespect and ignorance I have ever seen.  The staff is an embarrassment to this establishment and obviously not skilled or educated to understand their role in delivering customer service in a service industry.",

    "text": "If i could give it 2.5 stars I would.  I come here a couple times a month and its very hit or miss.   Its a place where at 10pm on a weekend is so packed its uncomfortable but is completely empty by midnight.  At night its mostly people in their 20s and 30s with a trendy/ hipster vibe.  They have a about 40 beers ( all craft) on tap and a selection of bottles and screens that show you whats on tap.    I would say their signature drinks are smoked whiskeys.  They are cool to watch being made but its basically JD with some fruit and smoke on ice for $12 so nothing special   In the summer this place gets hot, unless you are lucky enough to be sitting by the huge windows that open onto the sidewalk you will be sweating.  Happy hour is really good here all their beers end up being $3-4 as opposed to $5+.  Food is bar food nothing more nothing less  The biggest inconsistency is the staff some are super nice and attentive and some just should not be bartenders.  You would think that if u were living off of peoples tips you would try to be friendly as much as possible, but apparently not.  Some of the bartenders ( the ones that i have been seeing there for years) are flat out rude.  So much so that if they are working i will not go to their section for a drink.  I come back here from time to time, but if the staff was better i would come more often",

    "text": "Industry was one of those places that everyone in PGH seems to have eaten at except for me (what can I say, I'm not one of the cool kids, I guess).  When CM and I visited Lawrenceville on Sat. afternoon to see a movie at the Row House Cinema, we decided to go to a local restaurant for dinner.  Since I had a City Dining Card for Industry, I suggested that we give it a try if it wasn't too busy, so we stopped by to check it out.  Upon walking in at 5pm, the first thing that we noticed was the high noise level, despite the restaurant being less than half full.  Although the weather was pleasant, only one of the garage door-style windows in the front was open, which exacerbated the ambient noise from people's voices bouncing off of the exposed brick walls.  The music, which consisted mostly of early 2000's hits and struck me as outdated, rather than retro or hip, was also a notch louder than I would have liked, presumably to counteract the volume of the ambient conversations.  As if all of this auditory distraction wasn't enough, multiple TVs playing various sports (including rodeo, which I haven't seen televised before) were unavoidably visible from everywhere in the restaurant, adding a layer of visual distraction to the atmosphere.  Having heard about the smoke stack from my lab manager and having seen its popularity according to the Yelp reviews, I had to order one.  The smoke stack consists of whiskey that's imbued with additional smoky flavor through the burning of wood chips above it.  Each person creates their own version of the drink by choosing the whiskey base and then choosing the type of chip they want added.  For my version, I decided to go with the IPH rye whiskey (i.e., the house whiskey; $8) and the mesquite chips ($3), since our waitress told us they provided the smokiest flavor and recommended them for first time drinkers of the smoke stack.  I must confess that I was rather disappointed when the smoke stack was brought to the table already smoked--based on my lab manager's description, I thought it'd be brought to my table and smoked in front of me. The flavor of the drink wasn't very complex--it just tasted extra smoky to me.  If I came back and ordered this drink again, I'd sit at the bar so that I could see it smoked, and I'd choose a different flavor of chip next time (other options included maple, cherry, and other fruit flavors).  For our meal, CM went with the lamb burgher special ($15), and I went with the inside out cajun chicken sandwich ($13).  For the sides that came with the meal, CM had the standard fries, and I had a side salad.  Additionally, we ordered a side portion of the summer pasta salad to split ($4).  My side salad was your standard version with lettuce, a couple tomatoes, a slice of cucumber, and a few red onions, dressed with balsamic vinaigrette, and was thus rather boring.  The cajun chicken sandwich, which I ordered in hopes that it'd be one of the more flavorful options on the menu, unfortunately fell quite flat.  The seasoning offered very little heat, and it wasn't evenly spread across the chicken, such that some bites were completely bland.  Furthermore, the bagel that served as the inside out bookends of the sandwich was pretty greasy, which I wasn't expecting.  CM described his lamb burgher as quite moist, but reported that the bun wasn't high quality, such that it easily crumbled.  The fries, which I tried, were fresh-cut and were seasoned perfectly with just enough salt, but weren't quite as crisp as I would have liked.  Surprisingly, the pasta salad was the most flavorful dish that we ordered, and was quite tasty.  Overall, I must confess that I was rather disappointed in my experience at Industry.  Neither CM nor I were fans of the atmosphere, and the service wasn't great, either.  For the price we paid ($35+, before tip, even after the $10 dining card discount), the portions were smaller than I expected, and the execution was disappointing, even for casual bar food and drinks.  In these respects, the comparison to Harris Grill is quite apt.  For bar food and drinks done well, I recommend Fat Heads or Burgatory, both of which have a better atmosphere, as well.  Although I can now say I've been to Industry, I doubt I'll be back soon--I just don't understand the hype.",

Called when we were by IKEA to see how wait was. We were told that it was no wait or at most 5 minutes if they started one. It takes all of 5 minutes or less to get there from IKEA. Pull in and walk inside to be told wait would be 35-40 minutes. Wife questions that because we were told moments before no wait on the phone. Front of house staff not the nicest tonight. Ended up waiting 20+ minutes despite many, many empty tables. Waiter was a nice guy and did a good job. Lots of service complaints on Yelp about this place but our guy did well. Food took longer than what I thought it would. My fish and chips came out cold but was still tasty. If we weren't wanting to get to a movie I would have sent it back. Not a but if heat in the fish. I did notice someone walk past a few minutes before or food came with a fish and chips then after trying to deliver to a table take it back, wrong item I assume. My thought is that this ended up being my fish. Again many people waiting and tons of empty tables. Everyone else liked their food and they have a nice draft list.  Need to work on front of house staff and ensure food is served hot.",

NOT EVERYONE IS 17 AND HAS PERFECT EYESIGHT.   Our server was really nice, and was quick with everything.  This is something I REALLY appreciate.  I ordered a Megabus cocktail -- it was good, but a little bitter.  The ice melt made that easier as the meal went on.  For my lunch, I ordered off the brunch menu and got the Liberty Tubes.  The menu basically describes it as a breakfast burrito, but what you get is more like a fried, greasy wrap filled with a couple scrambled eggs and various other vegetables.  It was ok.  It got greasier as time went on.  And it was served with what I assume is sausage gravy?  Didn't make sense, and was cold and bleh.  Not a fan of that.  I'm glad I ate my friend's fries because I may have left hungry if I hadn't.  By the time I got to the second half of the \"burrito\" it was greasy enough to leave an oil slick on my hands.  No, thanks.   I'm being generous with my rating because of the service, and just because I didn't like what I got, it doesn't mean that everyone else was disappointed.  The beet salad, for example, was huge and looked really good.  She took those leftovers home.    If I'm ever down in that area again, I'll try again.  But I'll remember to order something completely different.",

    "text": "Great place to enjoy a new beer and grab dinner.  Industry Public House has a truly extensive craft beers list! I had a hard time narrowing down the choices since I hadn't heard of so many of them (and also haven't tried enough beers to know what I like). The servers were great and brought out small samples, which helped tremendously.   I ended up ordering the HITCHHIKER Cultured Creature Boysenberry Sour (4.2%), which was nicely tart, light, and refreshing.  Deep Fried Pickles || $8  Beer battered pickle spears. Not quite the fried pickle chips I'd expected, but still pretty good with the dipping sauce. Not as crunchy though since the spears retain quite a bit of juice!  Tramster Mozzarella Cogs || $10  Deep fried mozzarella slices served with marinara sauce. Wonderfully melty and crunchy.   Industrial Size Soft Pretzel || $15 HUGE soft pretzel that comes hot and nicely salted. I highly recommend getting a side of beer cheese (an extra $1). It's a savory, delicious cheese sauce that pairs fantastically with the soft pretzel bread. Great appetizer to share.   Truffled Filament Fries || $9 Fresh cut fries with white truffle oils and blue cheese. These are delicious! Loved that there was a truffle fries option :)  Macaroni & Cheese || $12  Generous serving of spiraled pasta covered with a cheese sauce. I was craving cheese, so opted to try the mac. Didn't find this dish quite to my liking though-- not very cheesy or flavorful. After a few forkfuls, I was wondering to myself how in the world I would get through the bowl. Probably better to skip this entree and try something else!  Brussel Sprouts with Bacon & Gorgonzola || $4  YUM. These roasted brussels are heavenly. Perfectly toasty and creamy. Highlight of my meal. Honestly, next time here I'd probably just get a couple sides of these brussels to serve as my entree. Yes. They're THAT GOOD :)",

Our table started the night off with the chili cheese fries and drinks. I had the Rose Sangria. The appetizer was super good. The chili on top is one of my favorites. My sangria was also good, but different. With some many tropical flavors it had somewhat of a sour taste. For dinner I had the President Salad. It's there take on a Caesar salad. Very good portion size. Our server was very attentive even with the large number of tables she has.   We hung out a while after drinker having another round of drinks.

We were going to Row House for an event but my boyfriend wanted to see the rest of the game so since this was close we figured it was a good place to grab a beer.  The place was packed, which wasn't surprising but we were able to grab a table near the bar with good views of the TV. Despite the crowds, our waiter was attentive and we weren't left waiting too long.  Now onto the beers... they have a pretty long tap list so we figured we should definitely be able to find some good options. Unfortunately the actual variety of the list wasn't as great as we would like. The list was extremely IPA heavy. As non-IPA drinkers our options were limited. We had a few beers, none of which blew us away. Prices can be a little on the high side and considering the lack of good options on the tap list I think there are better options.   All being said, if there is a cool event at Industry it may entice me to go down. I had previously attended a Pumpking flight even here. Also if I am doing something else close by I would keep it is a possibility. However, there are so many other options for beer and cocktails close by in Lawrencville that it probably wouldn't be my top choice.",

I have been there when it's super crowded and now choose to come in more of the off hours or make sure to get a reservation.  Last night I met up with some friends for some drinks later in the evening when a friend arrived in from out of town.  The bartenders and drinks were great. Started with some beer and then decided since it was our friend's first time in Pittsburgh that we had to get the whiskey smoked. He was absolutely enthralled with the presentation. I highly recommend doing this at least once, just for the experience. So Industry nailed it on the drinks.  My disappointment came with the bar food. At this point in the evening I realized I had not had food since lunch and the bartender recommended the tomato mozzarella flat bread.  I am not sure if the kitchen staff was just careless at that point in the evening at around 10 pm or if no one bothered to check the flat bread but it was burnt. The kitchen serves until midnight so I am not sure why this happened, but instead of making a big deal about it and having to wait another 20 min for a new one I ate the center pieces that were not hard or burnt. This hasn't been my experience before and the last time I had their food it was pretty solid to pair with the great drinks. Therefore, I am optimistic this was a one time thing and plan to not take Industry Public House off my Lawrenceville restaurant rotation.",

Main thing that caused me to cut my evening short (worth 2 more beers) is the \"music\" (all about the employees: hip-hop porridge--but this is not a club: format should chill-friendly, not play up to staff interest in JV clubbiness).

We split a giant, but overpriced, soft pretzel with dipping cheese and mustard. I personally thought it was great but $16 is a little steep.  While the food here is decent, the beer list is really what I like about it. There are many things to try, including a few of Industry's own beers.   I stuck with Industry's IPH (house IPA), because it was good, and one of the cheapest on draft at $5.50. If you do like beer, definitely check out what nitro beers they have available.   During the fall they had a nitro pumpkin spice latte stout - and as basic as we felt ordering it, it was worth it!",

    "text": "We visited Industry on a busy Friday evening, looking for some of the exciting drinks and food we'd heard this place does. The place was packed--had a 25 minute wait for a table, which was fine. We took a couple of spare stools at the bar and ordered some drinks. The beer list is good and the cocktail list sounded interesting. We tried some cocktails. They were okay but nothing special, unfortunately. We then moved to a table and ordered some food. My wife ordered a salad and I ordered a burger. I'd heard they do some great things with burgers, so I was pretty excited. A good \"fancy\" burger in Pittsburgh can still be hit or miss (more miss than hit). This was a total miss. The burger was way overcooked (ordered medium), the beef did not taste top quality, and the bun was stale. What a shame. The only positive were the fries, which we ordered with pot roast gravy. That was a tasty topping that elevated otherwise boring fries.  The service was so-so. The hostess dealing with the table wait list was pleasant and helpful. The bar staff were affable. Our waitress was friendly but pretty aloof (or indifferent?).   The ambience of the place on a busy night was great, though. Really felt like a happening bar in a happening neighborhood of Manhattan (actually the way the place is decorated reminds me of The Smith in the East Village).  This is a good bar for beers and maybe some basic snacks. Food was unimpressive but depends on the occasion I suppose. Two stars because they are trying to be something more than a bar with average bar food so they could do better. Hopefully they will as this is still a relatively new place.",

The bar is huge, fully stocked and the bartenders are always quick with a drink.  The best part is that I live super close and I can walk there on a Saturday evening and not have to wait too long to sit down and eat.  However, the reason that I give Industry only three stars is two-fold;  first, the music is sometimes so loud during dinner time (i.e., before 9 pm) that i can hardly hear myself think.  Second, there have been several occasions that the waitstaff has been incredibly rude.",

The Pot Roast sliders have mashed potato cakes and gravy in them and are superb. I shared them with my friend along with the delicious Charred Flatbread and Truffle Filament Fries. The Coconut Cake was really good too. Loved the decor and the service also.",

She was indifferent to us but totally rude to the table next to us. Eventually, after she literally threw a drink menu at them, they asked for a manager and left. We were a bit off-put by this, and then of course when we saw her SIPPING BEERS INTENDED FOR CUSTOMERS we immediately got up to leave, asked them to cancel our orders, and won't be back.   With how aloof the manager seemed to be, this place is straight up dangerous. I highly recommend staying away.",

    "text": "First off, I eat and drink at Industry Public House with company between 3 and 4 times a week as I live less than a block away. The restaurant has been open for a little more than a month. It's understandable that a new restaurant has initial growing pains - server issues, menu issues, billing issues, etc. I'd like to break my review out to explain the 2 star rating.  Food I would rate 4 stars. I've had the burgers, the pot roast, the beef sandwich, the bacon, the mac and cheese, the electric cheese, etc.  The food overall is not only creative but also VERY good.  Bravo.   Service via servers I would rate 3 stars. There still seems to be some confusion upon arrival and at times when seated. The host is not always present and it is somewhat typical to wait in the front of the restaurant wondering exactly what to do. I've waited on more than a couple of occasions for more than 5 minutes before even being acknowledged as a patron. The serving staff is very friendly albeit somewhat aloof at times. From delays in greeting you, to letting dishes pile up on a table, to bringing appetizers and entrees at the same time, to taking a significant amount of time to bring your change or the credit slip you should sign.  Very apologetic in almost all instances, but, in retrospect it should not be happening as much as it does.  Management I would rate 0 stars.  On my visit of May 08, 2012, I was treated with total disrespect by the restaurants chef. As I mentioned, I have eaten at the restaurant countless times. And on 6 of those occasions, I have ordered the bacon appetizer. While the menu does not indicate the number of pieces in an order; I have received 6 pieces each time. At $6 an order, I think it is a little expensive but boy is it good.  Tonight I received 5 pieces, and I told the server that I was light 1 piece. No big deal, my sandwiches had missing items on a few occasions, I said something and it was corrected promptly. TONIGHT WAS THE EXCEPTION.   I mentioned it to the server and figured it would be taken care of. Just another oversight.  What happened was not what I expected. The chef came to our table and beligerantly informed me that an order contained 4 pieces and that I had not received 6 pieces prior. I pointed out that I received 5 pieces tonight and was told that the order I received was wrong. He went on to explain that the cost per pound was X dollars, and in essence that I should be happy with what I got. He ROLLED HIS EYES AT ME and walked away in total DISGUST.  I told the server what happened, went over again that in prior visits what policy was, and that I expect to spend close to $1,000 this year there. In essence, try and make it right this time.  What happened instead was that the chef returned to our table, brought 2 pieces of bacon, and said I gave you 2 but next time you're here the order is 4. He dropped the tray on the table, ROLLED HIS EYES AGAIN, and walked away in DISGUST.   So the meal didn't start out so good.  A simple here is another slice, followed by an \"our policy is actually 4 slices\", but I'll make it right this time would have been enough to satisfy me. I made the customer happy, I let him know the policy, and now he knows for the next time.  Problem solved.  But...  Then I order the Management Burger which is explained on the menu as the Worker Burger plus bacon and a peppercorn rub. Check <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Findustrypgh.com&s=d902ae4795736a39017788011904a5c2b8d51497d1f72aacfcbfe05b7fe22627\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">industrypgh.com</a>. The Worker Burger includes your regular toppings plus mozzarella cheese.  I receive my order and it is missing the cheese.  So, I tell the server and he returns the burger to the kitchen. Well guess what...  The chef returns to explain that the the Worker Burger is actually the Factory Burger and that they print their own menus. What?! I think...  He then tells me in an aggressive tone that I if I want cheese there will be a $2 up charge. He asks that I confirm my understanding of the charge, ROLLS HIS EYES AT ME AGAIN (3rdTIME mind you) and storms off in disgust AGAIN.   Now I am a business owner and in a prior life was involved with the public. Cardinal rule number one is that the Customer is ALWAYS right. If the customer is misinformed, you make it right first, explain the policy and move on. Enough said. You DO NOT ATTACK the customer or in any event EVER ROLL YOUR EYES AT THEM. You treat people as how you would want to be treated.  And I wouldn't be making such an issue of this but it's not the first time I have seen this interaction between a customer and the chef. In fact, I have seen on two separate occasions where the chef was not only disrespectful but also aggressive with the customer. It's just bad business. PERIOD.  So to the owner and/or manager. I've said my piece. I hope you don't take this comment with a grain of salt. Make sure the staff knows that they are in the food SERVICE INDUSTRY. Treat people with respect and dignity. And they'll keep coming back. You've got a good thing going there. Make sure the customer is happy, it's as simple as that.",

    "text": "I have been here a handful of times to grab cocktails with friends on busy \"drinking nights\". Whenever I enter Industry I feel like I am transported into Shadyside as soon as I walk through the door. For those who are unfamiliar with Pittsburgh geography/demographics, I can only say that this relates to the high concentration of yuppies and preppy students/professionals who frequent this bar. In addition, there is this unavoidable air of snootiness present that I can't quite put my finger on. The bar is impressive and they offer a variety of specialty drinks. The bartenders are more standoffish and you really need to thrust your cash out onto the bar to get any attention. The drinks are priced high which is somewhat painful considering that you can get them for half as much across the street. The design/interior of the building is nice (exposed brick, hip industrial feel, large open garage door windows). There is usually a large grim bouncer that stands outside on busy nights. The area within this restaurant/bar is ample which makes it nice for larger groups of people. The bathrooms are clean and inviting (this is always important to me). If you like hanging out in places like the Walnut Grill, Marios, Harris Grill, etc. Industry would probably be a good choice for you. If you enjoy a vibe that is more artsy, laid back, eclectic and cool, try somewhere else on Butler St.",

I frequent Industry Public House about once a week and am never disappointed in the food, service, beer selection, and overall experience.  I was first attracted to Industry because of the beer list.  Being a self acclaimed beer snob, I was so excited to see a plethora of different craft beers.  When I found out they rotate the selection as well, I was in heaven.  I have eaten there numerous times - from a full meal to just appetizers - and have yet to not clean my plate.  (Plug for the lobster sliders which will absolutely rock your world).  The service at Industry is second to none.  The bartenders are always friendly and attentive and put on great shows while making their signature cocktails.  The ambiance of Industry is a great mix of classy meets industrial meets modern meets bar next door.   Two enthusiastic thumbs up.  I was there last night and am already pumped to go back!!!",

Came in with a group of 7 and the hostess was clearly annoyed of our table request to push tables together. My server was also extremely condescending when we asked questions, and made it very clear she did not want to have to repeat the options for side orders. She rushed through telling us about a bunch of options that sounded delicious, but I ended up just going with the French fries because I did not feel comfortable asking questions and didn't catch everything she said. I should also add that it was no busy while we were there. I'm a server myself and a very easy going customer, but nothing is more irritating when you feel like you are annoying your server/hostess with simple requests. My group Of seven go lucky, friendly, and understanding  friends didn't really know how to respond and it made for a very uncomfortable experience. It wouldn't have made me so angry if it was one rude employee, but it started with a hostess with an attitude and the server was just as bad (if not worse). Way to kill the beautiful Saturday afternoon vibes industry public house!  Great food and beer though",

Industry definitely delivers on that regard with a really nice ambiance that isn't too overtly upscale. I've been to Industry about 10 times since it opened and the service has steadily declined since the first week. The bar tending staff is frustrating, it takes FOREVER to get their attention. The young lady who waited on us last night took literally 20 minutes at every step of the drink ordering transaction and rather than giving one or two customers her full attention she proceeded to wait on 10 different people at once while fumbling around and clearly losing track of what she was doing. Another bar tender will just blatantly ignore you and he used to do the same thing when he worked at AVA.   This place is still a great concept with a lot of potential and I think it could improve immensely by getting rid of a few of the weak links in the bar tending staff.",

The young lady who greeted us was very nice and seated us quickly. This used to be a Don Pablo's but you would never know it. Both the exterior and interior have been remodeled. The decor is very industrial yet warm and inviting.  The beer selection is outstanding-40 taps plus bottles. They have basic beers, a ton of craft beers, and even some hard to find beers. If you use the Untappd (not a typo) app and check in your pic will pop up on the Digital Pour Electronic Draft Menu board. I am not a big beer drinker but I tried and liked the Altec Peach Burbon Barrel Ale. If you ask they will give you samples. They even use the proper beer glasses.  For dinner we ordered the Pot Roast with Mashed Potatoes, Fish and Chips, and Ribs. The ribs had a great smokey flavor and we're falling off the bones. I thought it was a great price for the amount of ribs you get. The ribs comes with a side of coleslaw. The coleslaw is not overly vinegary or overly sweet. It is a nice compliment to the ribs.  There were 2 big pieces of beer battered fish. You could taste the beer in the flaky batter. It was cooked perfectly and the fish was moist and delicious. It sat on a bed of fries and had a small side of coleslaw. The fries were good as well. They make their own tarter sauce which looks like Thousand Island dressing.  The Pot Roast came in a big bowl. The Pot Roast was some of the best I have ever had in a restaurant. It sat on top of homemade mashed potatoes and had a brown gravy poured on top. It was the right amount of gravy-not too much, not to little. It was the perfect consistently. It was topped with crunchy fried onion rings. We all pretty much liked our plates.  There were all ages of people here enjoying a beer or a meal. We will definitely be back!!!",

    "text": "The best part of the food truck roundup this past weekend? The long lines that forced to change our plans and walk to Industry Public House, where getting food was a much more pleasurable experience!  We were greeted by a nice hostess and got a cozy hightop immediately...during dinner hours on a Saturday! Our server was also really nice, and I loved that they bring you a big bottle of water to refill your glass so you're not constantly waiting for your server to stay on top of it.  The atmosphere was pretty nice, although the music was way too loud, which had my wife and I constantly saying, \"what?\" to each other. It was also a little too dark towards the back of the restaurant to see the menus, but we managed. Other than that, we liked the place. The solid beer selection on tap doesn't hurt, either!  We opted for a pretty simple meal: fried mozzarella and the cheese & bacon fries for apps, and two burgers (the top two on the burger list; their names escape me), and mac & cheese and a salad for our sides.   The apps were both good, but with apps like that, it's hard to say they're remarkably better than a lot of other places. I will say that the marinara that came with the fried mozzarella was the best part. I'm pretty sure they use honey in their sauce, which threw me off a bit at first, but grew on me quickly. I would order it again just for the sauce.  The burgers were good and cooked properly to-order. Of course, it was so dark, it would've been difficult. to see. Haha. Regardless, the flavor was good. The side of mac and cheese was also really good, and the chili-style seasoning they mix in adds some nice interest to a dish that's quickly getting too trendy and overplayed these days.  Overall, we had an excellent experience. The staff was great and the atmosphere was nice. The only issues are things that they can control, literally, with the flick of a switch or turn of a volume knob! Add in the reasonably-priced, delicious food, and we're left with nothing but reasons to return!",

    "text": "I actually feel kind of bad. Our waitress was a gem and it really wasn't her fault, and I've been assured that this was an off day, even by her, but this place just missed the mark on just about everything.   We walked in around 1:30 on a Sunday. It wasn't busy by any means. A few tables filled, 5 or so people at the bar, and I think only 2 waiters were on the clock. The hostess seemed confused trying to find a table for 5 people, in the chaos of pushing 2 tables together (?!) she forgot to bring menus or silverware, which I noticed the couple next to us were also missing.   Finally our waitress came over to take out orders. Waters took some time to come out, so I should have noticed by that, that the rest of the meal may not go as I'd hoped.   We didn't order any drinks as we already had arsenal cider at home. But we did start with the country fried chicken livers, then ordered our entrees. 4 burgers, 3 of which were the blast pig and one farmed out, all rare, 3 with specialty fries (one of each) and a cluck house sandwich. My brother also ordered a side of macaroni and cheese.  So we waited, and waited, and waited some more until we finally asked someone to find our waitress as it had been about 45 minutes without us receiving our appetizer. She came over and apologized, comped the app, and finally brought it out. They were okay. I wish they had cut them smaller so the batter could have cut through the richness. The aioli paired with them were good.   After about another 25 minutes of waiting, all of our entrees came out. All 4 burgers were overcooked. And not by a little bit. 4 rares were more like medium wells. Not a spot of pink in a single one. I had the farmed out with a fried egg and the egg wasn't runny. Like, what's the point? The fries weren't even edible. 3 out of the 4 of us who ordered burgers, upgrades our fries spending another $4 on top of the already expensive burger, it was just insane. The blast big burgers didn't have the candied jalapenos which is mostly the point of ordering it, and my sisters pot roast fries didn't have those delicious onion straws that were supposed to accompany them. My chili cheese fries were just sad.  My fiance actually enjoyed his cluck house (and for good reason, it was delicious) but his side of Brussels sprouts ($5 additional) left a lot to be desired. Weird, barely boiled, smelly sprouts that immediately brought you back to childhood when you hated them. Strange cheese sauce and burnt bacon didn't help either.   We asked for our waitress to come so we could tell her the problem with 4 out of our 5 entrees. She was sweet, told us she'd bring over the manager, and came right back. They comped our meals, gave us boxes for the food we wanted to bring back with us, and apologized profusely. But, the manager never came. I thought it was rude. Certainly not her fault, but embarrassing for the establishment. We tipped her quickly and left.   Between the manager not really caring and the fact that it wasn't busy brought it down to 2 stars for me. I really think it was an off day, and I'd come back on a weeknight next time I visit, but this situation just wasn't ideal.",

The bartender with the Joan Of Arc looking arm tattoo was not very friendly and the only time she attempted a smile was when she handed me the check.  I would probably visit the Robinson location next time and skip Lawrencville.",

If you share a similar phobia, I would recommend you overcome it and head on out to this Don Pablo's reboot.  They did a fantastic job of transforming this joint to fit an industrial pub theme! While I wouldn't expect a warm welcome (the service leaves something to be desired), the food was spectacular and the drink wasn't bad!  If you're out and about in the Robinson area and want to try something new, I recommend giving this Public House a try!",

I am missing the half star and really its not even a half (it's less than that) because the music would got loud, really loud, a few times it did that but they did turn it down for good as we were finishing our lunch. And the street parking stinks although we got lucky. On with my review...after walking around the zoo me and the hubby had worked up quite the appetite and after a short deliberation chose Industry. I am very glad we did! Yummy! We found a parking spot on the street a few doors down from the restaurant (it is street parking here). We stepped out of the car and were instantly greeted with the wonderful aromas of grilled burgers and tastiness. Oh, did it smell delightful! We stepped into Industry and were greeted by a friendly hostess who promptly sat us. I found the atmosphere very inviting and lofty. I am a sucker for wood floors, tables, and bars with beautiful, brick walls and exposed duct work. I told the hubby if we ever are lucky enough to have a bar in our house I want it to look their smaller one. It was gorgeous wood with the wall behind it a rusted metal, wow! They also had their windows open yet it was very comfortable in the dining room and the road noise was not an issue at all. Now the food...we were waited on immediately by our wonderful waiter who got us water right away. We looked at the menu and made our choices. I picked the Model \"T'urkey sandwich. It was a huge, thick, slab o' turkey on bread with lettuce, tomato, Guyere cheese, & garlic aioli. The turkey was succulent and delicious. I also got the pot roast fries minus the onion straws. The fries did not need them. The pot roast was juicy and the gravy, oh my goodness! I would go back just for the fries. The hubby chose the Farmed Out burgher minus the cheddar and minus the BBQ sauce. He thought the burger was done to his standards :) and said he'd go back for it. He got the regular fresh cut fries. He liked those too. Oh, how did I forget...the bacon they had on both of the sandwiches, need I say more than Bacon. And how could we go there and not try a drink. I got a whiskey sour with their house Bourbon whiskey. It was very good.  The hubby chose their copper ale. He liked it a lot. It was fresh and light. We enjoyed our stop at Industry and will visit again!",

Our server was very nice but had little knowledge of gluten free options for my friend.      We started off with the truffled fries and they were fantastic! I love that they made a sauce out of the truffle oil and Gorgonzola instead of just tossing both ingredients on the fries.   I ordered the Electric cheese. It was a pretty good sandwich but I think I'll try something else next time.  At first I was a bit displeased with the tiny glasses of water until our server brought us our own chilled jug of water.

I chose the chicken dumpling pot pie. It was good, but was more soupy than anticipated and with lack of much texture. My wife had nachos, which she disliked. She could not eat many of them. My son had a burger and fries covered with pot roast meat. The burger was OK, but the fries were very good. The service was OK, but could have been more attentive. The prices were reasonable.

It's like refried beans on a bun, mushy, really horrible, not to mention the order was not how I ordered it.  Replaced that with a burger which was tasteless.  Table of 8 ordered apps and burgers.  One person ordered a salad.  Everyone was half done with entrees before her salad even came out.  Friend ordered a medium rare burger and it was medium well.   I want to like this place.  Really, I do.  The potential is there.  Manager did take some things off bill and gave a few gift cards but honestly, I'd rather just have a good experience without poor quality food and excuses.  My advice would be get a food expediter on the kitchen window and if something comes out incorrect, send it right back.  They can't even get drink orders to the table in a timely manner and mistakes on those too.    Management needs trained properly.  Hostess had no idea we made reservations as well. Imagine our surprise with 8 people and reservations made and they were clueless.  Seriously, I won't go back unless every restaurant nearby is closed.",

I didn't have a chance to try other things on the menu but was not very impressed with the calamari appetizer that I got. The portion size was way too small to be shared and the calamari itself tasted like it had been sitting out for a while and not made fresh. The other people in my group did like the food (but also had small portions besides the giant pretzel) so it may have just been my luck on getting a bad plate of apps.

Those were the only house brews available.  There was guest tap chocolate mint stout which was True to style and name. Wonderful dessert drink.  Lots of beers on tap. Really nice.  I bet the parking in Lawrenceville can be challenging but we lucked into a spot quickly.  Wife had fish and chips.  Huge and she enjoyed it.  It looked delicious.  My hot turkey sandwich was also very good and filling.  Both of our fries were dark and looked over cooked but tasted alright.  But did not look appetizing.  We sat against the right had wall as you enter and the televisions on that wall are way too high fo some sitting at the table facing the wall.  Everyone was moving to sit next to their dining companion as I did   Good experience and I will be back",

For me today, the Farmed Out Burger. White Cheddar, Wild Boar Bacon, caramelized onions, fried egg, and bbq sauce. A 5 star burger, fresh bun, burger was juicy as can be, dippy egg, cheddar flavor was very prominent, the caramelized onions were perfect and delicious, the bacon, delicious, your sensing a theme here, yes, the burger was awesome!!! Its up there with the best the Burgh has to offer. Side of fresh cut garlic fries, with the skin on, sooooo yummy. A great meal to say the least. Just go, is all I can say.",

Both were delicious and the truffle fries are a must get. The spinach and artichoke dip came with chips and pita bread.  For our entrees we got the Mac and cheese with wild boar bacon, fish and chips, and the pot roast. Mac and cheese was HUUUUUUGE, such a large portion, definitely enough for two; super delicious. The fish and chips weren't bad but I'd probably pass on that next time, just because there are more exciting things to order. The pot roast was also very good and another large portion.   The service was good and the atmosphere was really casual and nice. I had a nice dinner and enjoyed it. It's a little pricey but they're pretty typical for the lawrenceville area.

    "text": "After a brutally long wait since our first visit in 2015, we were once again treated to an incredible experience at IPH in Lawrenceville.  Everything from the service to the food and drink was outstanding!!  Here are some of the highlights. First, and most importantly, the infamous smokestack. While I have tried to recreate this bourbon campfire in your mouth with moderate success, it's always better here.   We ordered the soft pretzel which was bigger than my 5 y/o's head and quite delicious to boot.  Great cheese sauce and mustard for dipping.  The Blast Pig burger was cooked perfectly and orgasmic, just as I remembered. Those parmesan truffle fries though.  Other highlights to round out our meal and my waistline included the Brussels with bacon and gorgonzola as well as the quinoa burger (wifey).    Although my attention and thirst were focused on smokestacks, they do have a solid beer list. My wife enjoyed a few of their beers but I got to sample.     Our waiter (the name slips me but was a shorter, thicker dude) was awesome.  Great personality, friendly, and helpful.    Yes, I consumed at least a few days' worth of calories in just under 90 minutes, but after the short stint of indigestion followed by a loosening of the belt moment, I felt great about everything. See yinz next time we are in the Burgh.",

This time around, I went with a craft beer (they have a fantastic selection) and the impossible burger. I was so happy to see they were serving this plant based option on the menu, as I tend to go with a plant based burger over a meat burger most days (it's lighter feeling and it tastes just as good!). It came with an onion kaiser roll, roasted garlic, and some veggies. I went with a salad on the side. The side salad was pretty big, fresh, and tasty. The impossible burger was great. I did order it \"medium rare\" and it came out more well done, which was a little disappointing. However, it was still delicious. The roasted garlic was literally just that, which made for very flavorful punches throughout the burger. Overall, it was delicious.   One of their signature drink is a smoked whiskey drink (the smokehouse)- lots of people were ordering them when I dined here on a Saturday evening.. meaning it smelled like a campfire in there, which was QUITE enjoyable :)",

I asked for the steak to be medium rare but it came out well done... not sure if it is cause they cut the steak then cook it... but it was very cooked to me. It was also quite salty.... apart from the steak the salad was regular. I like the cucumber slices on it. Nothing too special about this salad. I also got a beer which I don't remember... it was amber something   Environment  I love the look and feel of this place. High ceilings, very industrial looking, yes yes I know it's in the name. There is plenty parallel parking spots outside that's paid parking.  Niceness of the staff I didn't complain about anything. I did ask for a beer recommendation, which I know it's hard since she doesn't know my taste. But she gave me a beer in the end and I liked it, thank you!   Dollar About $6 for the beer and the salad was around $12... decent yes?   Yes?  Eh, it was so so... maybe another time.   #WendyWanders",

I LOVED the \"mozzarella cogs\" and \"company salad\" and as a girl with an appetite, I generally appreciated the bigger portions on some of the menu options.   For some of the entrees, however, I would even argue that they give you too much food. The Nachos for instance, while although good, I'm never going to order something that big! The chips got cold before we came even close to finishing them and it just seemed like too much on one plate. Regardless, the toppings were fresh and yummy and it could be a nice snack to share with a large group of friends.   I also must say that, looking at the menu, I can't help but wonder why they would price their \"industrial sized pretzel\" at 15 dollars...  I mean, it's a bit much, you know? I never actually ordered the pretzel and I do think the amount of food they give you for the price is generally quite generous so I can't imagine how large this pretzel would have to be to justify charging customers 15.00 for one. Does anyone really need that much pretzel?  Anyhoo, with reasonable prices, satisfying serving sizes, and friendly staff I give this place a solid 4 out of 5 stars.",

    "text": "Something I really want to note is that 5 years ago, this would have been a 5-star review. In fact, this used to be one of my favorite places to get together with friends! I lived in Highland Park and worked in Friendship and my coworkers and I would stop in for lunch, it would always be my suggestion for dinner, and I held my 24th birthday party here.   In recent years, I've gotten married, moved to the suburbs and had a son. My time spent in bars has been cut down drastically in place of trips to Chick-Fil-A. But in the last year, I've made three trips here, and I have to say that It's just not as good as it used to be.   First of all, it's insanely loud and crowded. I know this means it's popular, but it's basically impossible to hear what other people are saying around you. It's also really difficult to get the bartenders' attention. When it first opened, it would be busy, but now the number of people have started to affect the atmosphere and service - which is much slower.   This review isn't based on the cocktails or beer selections. Of my last two trips, once I was the DD and once I was pregnant.  As far as the food, I was incredibly disappointed to find out they took the Lucy Furnace, a portabello-based vegetarian sandwich off of the menu. I'm not even a vegetarian, that sandwich was just SO GOOD. I typically got it with the mixed greens and I'm not sure if that is a side option anymore either.   Both times I went recently, I got the flatbreads. They are on the happy hour special and are a great deal. I got the tomato once and the buffalo mac and cheese once. They were very good!... pretty much like any other restaurant in the same price range. Nothing really unique or out of the park.   I really wish that I could still give this place a 5-star review, but I am definitely not planning my 30th birthday party here.",

However, you can't go wrong no matter which one you go with.  In terms of food, they have some very unique and delicious options.  My favorite item is the buffalo chicken Mac and cheese flatbread.  Despite all the ingredients the dough is crispy and holds up to everything.  The flavors all come together perfectly.  Make sure to get some of their delicious ranch dressing as well!  The only bad thing is that it can get super crowded at times.  This is mostly True on Friday and Saturday nights.  If you don't want to be shoulder to shoulder with others, it is probably best to avoid it on these nights.",

It's a large space with that rustic/industrial aesthetic that's common with any bar that has the words; Public House, Gastro pub/lounge/house, or craft. A large bar splits up the venue into two halfs with ample seating on both sides. Additionally there appeared to be at least one private dining/event space that remained empty during our visit, but cool nonetheless.  They've got a decent selection of craft beers displayed on a TV screen above the bar, I ordered a couple beers I can't remember and they were good. Cocktails were kinda meh, nothing to write home about.  As for service, it wasn't overly busy so I'm surprised it took as long as it did to get service when we were just getting beers - and we had a table but still had to order from the bar which was odd.  For me, it felt a lot like a college bar, and while that's great for some, it's not somewhere I fell in love with. A-OK for me, nothing more or less.  Eatcrest Out",

Unfortunately, their happy hour is from 4:30-6:30 and we missed by about 10 minutes. However, they a great selection of brews on tap. Many different kinds for all types of beer lovers. We also sat in the bar section- their tables are tight but luckily the food is good.   To start, we ordered the giant pretzel. They have beer cheese, mustard, and cinnamon butter to go with it. This big guy is about $15 but it's worth it to share!   For my entree, I ordered the fish & fries. It was very good - however they were out of cocktail sauce, but our did apologize a few times. I would definitely order it again.   I'll be back to Industry again soon!",

    "text": "Looking at the mixed reviews here, it seems I caught Industry on a good night. My general thoughts: \"This place is serious business.\"  Started off with a Smokestack. If you're a whiskey drinker, this is a must. Choose your whiskey, choose the wood, and let them do the rest. I just had Maker's, but the drink was fantastic. If we were there for beverages and not dinner, I easily could have spent the evening experimenting with various combinations. I have to give props to a place whose whiskey list rivals their beer and wine lists.   The gorgonzola fries are also a must. The fries themselves were excellent. Well seasoned, crispy, cooked through. But the gorgonzola on top? As Myron Cope would say, \"Yoi!\"  I had the Lucy Furnace portabella sandwich. It was tasty, fairly standard (let's be honest, there's only so much you can do with a portabella sandwich). The only problem was that gravity worked against me, and I ended up having to eat the sandwich with a fork. C'est la vie!  We were there on the earlier side of dinner, but were quickly seated and I have no complaints at all about the service. I will absolutely go back.",

I love all types of salad. so it doesn't take much to impress me. A little over priced for quality of food. Eggrolls weren't spectacular for $4.50 each, cut and served on a fancy platter. We were served by two bartenders. The guy bartender became impatient with us - being this was our first time there. We needed to peruse  the menu. Many selections of beer on tap. Fairly priced. Atmosphere was a nice place. Love the open brick look.  Our food was handed to us by, I believe the owner. Of course, he was very nice. I would still stop by for a beer. The food can wait.",

There are so many choices, it's hard to choose just one!  The others had burgers, salads and flatbread and they all looked equally as good and everybody said they were!

The bar service was horrendous, getting a bartenders attention became a joke with the six people in our group.  The food, delivered by the kitchen, was great, the smoky whiskey drinks we begged for were wonderful, but the bar tenders were abhorrent.  The ceiling must be impeccable because that's all the bartenders looked at when they occasionally graced us with their  presence.  I'm being completely serious, it was that bad.  Industry must do one heck of a business to get away with treating patrons this badly.  So if you like pleading for service and being treated like sh.t, by all means make the trip out to industry and quickly learn your place.",

I find it annoying that on a Monday it felt like they were out of half of the items on the menu. I also found that for the price it was just a solid good. The bread pudding was laying in a apricot sauce. It was good but not how I have had bread pudding in any form before. My fries where good but greasy. The apricot mozzarella was good but for 9$ all you get it 4 small peaces. I would say oh well they had to spend a lot of time making it but I have made it from scratch before so that would be a lie. I will stop there. I'm giving 3 stars for good service and my burger was cook perfect and with lots of good toppings. But apart from that it was only good. I have been a few times before and every time it's different. Ranging from great to good. But in the end a little to pricy.",

    "text": "How long is too long to wait for food? 20 minutes? A half hour? An hour? What about an hour and a half?? What if you waited that long, got crappy service, and the manager was totally unsympathetic? I went to Industry Public House with a group of friends (6 altogether) for hopes of a tasty meal and a few drinks. The atmosphere is fun, the decor is very cool, and the drink list is humongous. However, the service is absolutely abysmal, to the point that I will not go back.  It was a Saturday evening during the Rock All Night Tour, which is a very cool music festival that took place in several venues with several music genres. The idea was to showcase local music and the Lawrenceville neighborhood, so we thought it would be fun to eat local as well. When we put our name on the list, the wait was supposed to be 40 minutes, but we only waited about 15 minutes- a plus. The hostess was considerate and sat as down right away- another plus. Our waiter came running over with menus and took our drink orders, which were brought to us in a relatively short time- great so far. Then, he took our orders- on a Samsung Galaxy Tablet- and promised it would be quick and efficient, thanks to the electronic ordering- very cool.  And he was right, the appetizers we ordered came out very fast. My wife and I had the pot roast gravy fries, which tasted like Kennywood Potato Patch fries only smothered in pot roast- yum. Another couple in our group also enjoyed their appetizer, and frolic and joviality ensued. A great start to our evening. But then, it all went downhill. Maybe I'm being too hard on our waiter- perhaps he was kidnapped by aliens, or was wrongfully incarcerated, or had to deliver a baby in the backroom. Something must have kept him very busy, because 30 minutes after we finished out appetizers, there was still no entrees, no drink refills, no new beers, and our waiter was MIA. This was about the time we all started commenting on the length of our wait. We watched as other patrons were sat, ordered, waited upon, and paid their bills as we waited an hour after our appetizers to finally inquire what was happening. I like to believe my group and I are pretty laid back in these instances, but this was ridiculous.  We finally flagged a manager over to ask what was happening, which was about the time our waiter finally reappeared. I guess he must have stopped the asteroid or disarmed the bomb, or whatever important thing he was doing that he finally got away from to come running over upon seeing us talking to the manager. When we asked the manager what was going on, he stated that they were slammed and our food would be next. When my friend asked him why everyone else seemed to be getting their food without waiting, he looked over at a table and snapped back \"that guy's eating nachos, which takes like 2 seconds to make.\" He then promised to buy us a round of drinks and that are food was already ready and would be over right away. We waited. And waited. A couple sat down near us, ordered food, ate, and were paying their bill as we waited. Finally, a half hour after the manager promised our food was coming, we gave up and proceeded to leave. After all, it had been over an hour and a half since we were sat, and this was unbelievable. I could have gone to the grocery store, bought the items needed, made the meal, served it and washed the dishes in the time it took them to bring out two hamburgers, two grilled cheese sandwiches, a salad, and a cup of chili. Unfortunately, our waiter reappeared with our food as we were standing up to leave. Arrgh, now we're eating after all. Despite the wait, the food looked good. My wife enjoyed her chili, and my burger with goat cheese looked yummy, but it was room temperature when I got it and I wasn't about to send it back. Everyone else commented that their food was good, but maybe it was because we were hungry, angry, and just wanted the evening to end. Amazingly, the waiter was quick to bring our bills and take our payment. We left a 15% tip, despite my objections that that was too much. Later that evening, I was visited my Montezuma's Revenge. Of all the times I've been sick from food, this was easily in my top 5. The next morning, I was still tasting goat cheese and bile in my throat.  It's unfortunate that such a hip place in Lawrenceville would have such poor service. I guess I was wrong to assume that a business with a menu would actually want to serve food, and not try to be a night club/bar. If you are going to have a full menu, then serve it. Otherwise, serve tapas and appetizers and focus on the drinks. And if you are the manager, be a bit courteous and listen to complaints- we really tried to be understanding and support a local business, but we won't be going back.",

Out of the 12+ times I've been here I think I've had good service maybe once. - bartenders seem annoyed mostly anytime you place an order - they don't have enough bartenders on staff given the complexity of some of their cocktails (this is probably why they are annoyed when you ask for them) - servers are meh. I was there once with a friend who gave a server a $20 to pay for a $5 beer. The server never returned with change. - food is sometimes really slow, the pacing also isn't right if you get apps (things some out at the same time or apps come out after your food).  I do like this place, and I'm sure I'll be back. However, if you're a person who gets annoyed easily be lack-luster service just avoid this place. Everyone who works here gives off a bad vibe.

The place was busy as usual, but the service was horrible. Our waitress barely acknowledged us most of the night.  What would normally be an hour-long meal turned into two and a half hours of sitting around.   Just about every beer out party requested from the list was gone (we were told that the list was very outdated). With a selection like theirs, the draft list should be updated daily.   When our food came, mine was barely warm and. My fries were tiny scraps of cold leftover fries. Another person at the table had a hot meal with normal-sized fries.   The waitress barely stopped by and we ended up only getting two beers each. Two beers in 2.5 hours? I couldn't even maintain a nice buzz.   There were no apologies for the delays and, in fact, we sat there with the table cleared for the last half hour and finished out jug of water before she came back and asked if we wanted the check.    I know she was busy, but that service is unacceptable. Especially after noticing the wait staff sitting around bitching about how busy it was and one of the kitchen staff was standing around at the urinal in the men's room talking on the phone about how busy they were.  If it's so busy, get out there and get things caught up.    Is Industry getting too big for its britches?",

Good place to take a date who enjoys cocktails.  The place is medium loud but not so loud you need a cochlear implant to hear your dining partner.",

    "text": "The place has a big city vibe to it, but the service is as unpretentious as it gets.  I've been there twice now (both this week), once for cocktails, and went back three days later because I wanted to try their food.  The beverages:  I've ordered two manhattans, whatever the last drink on their  drink list was, and their own Copper Kettle draft.  You can get any of their whiskeys smoked with your choice of mesquite, apple wood, and like three other woods.  I prefer the apple wood, its not as heavy but flavorfull.  Note:  you will get ash in your drink, but it won't kill you.  I had one manhattan smoked and one not.  Their's are different here, they don't use bitters, nor cherries.  Instead they use orange zest in which they heat to bring the flavors out (very important) and a secret ingredient.  ( I was really suprised we i was told what it was, but you'll have to ask)  The signature drink i had was pretty tasty, but i'm not a sweet drink guy.  The beer was pretty good...Full Pint does their brewing so it can't be bad.  The Food:  I had a prime rib or steak sandwich with horseraddish and truffle fries.  The fries were great, but the gorganzola masks the truffle oil, and the sandwhich had great meat, but was missing the kick that i was hoping for from the horseraddish.  the bread was also really buttery so I would order something else with company.",

My last review ranted raved about the service and the food, and I gave them a well deserved 5 stars, but we weren't as impressed this time. Not that anything was WRONG, but just not deserving that coveted 5 star rating. Our sever, while friendly, wasn't as good as who we had last year. We waited FOR EVER for just about everything.. food orders, drinks, boxes.. everything. He forgot to ring in one persons order and they sat there empty handed until we were all long finished our meals. I got the Brussel sprouts once again because last time I was hooked on them and anticipating my next opportunity to have them, and I was so terribly let down. They changed the way they make them, I guess, and it was such a disappointment. I truly just didn't like them.. and it was sad.  My husband wasn't crazy about his burger, he said the aoli was way over powering. He didn't eat more than half of it, which is not normal, haha. I mean, not to say we won't return, but I'm hoping that last time wasn't just a fluke.. we'll see what happens the next time we go, I guess.",

This place has an AWESOME selection of craft beer on tap, and a massive selection of bourbon, which they will prepare in a very special way - SMOKED.  No kidding.  They smoke bourbon right at the bar, so the place smells awesome when you walk in.  I give this place four stars instead of three just because of the great selection of taps and bourbons. (and the candied bacon)  But as far as the rest of the menu goes, it's kind of a mixed bag.  The soup was obviously homemade and pretty good.  The nachos plate was huge with lots of toppings, but there weren't enough chips to support all of the stuff on top, and they turned to mush rather quickly.  The pot roast fries were homey and reasonably priced, the french fries served with the burger were mushy.  But they are so new that they are working out the bugs.  There were so many people in the place and the staff was so new that there were many problems with the kitchen.  (including sending out the wrong burger to our party.  Yuck - who puts fresh spinach WITH the stems on a burger?)  The staff was enthusiastic and trying hard, but were just getting their feet wet since the place had only been open for a week.   I'll visit again - hopefully the kinks will be worked out.",

The menu says 11.  The bartender says \"That it will be 14.\" I point out that the menu says 11. She then informs me that they \"up charge\" for neat. I am confused and the look on my face shows it. I say, \"You charge for no ice?\". To which she says, neat means more alcohol. I'm dumbfounded and we go back and fourth about the meaning of neat and she insist that's what bars do. That is not what \"bars\" do. That is what this place does.  I have had Scotch neat in a hundreds of bars and restaurants (dives to very fine dining) across the country and never once has anyone charged me above menu price because I don't want water down liquid gold. Big time disappointment.    After paying, I looked at the menu a second time and it does mention it at the bottom under \"Up Grades\".  There are several so called up grade items that were unfamiliar to me and nondescript.  The one she hit me with was listed as \"Rocks/Neat +2\", which implies both are a 2 dollar charge.  With there already being a large mark up on alcohol, is it necessary to add 2 dollars for not wanting ice?  It is if your \"on the rocks\" pours are so small, that pouring a drink neat would show how much you are ripping people off.  I would rather you establish a consistent pour and charge me the same rate than flim flam me.",

If what you're after is what I think it is: upwardly mobile young professionals seeking a quality setting for upscale food and drink, then staffing your otherwise attractive space with a cretan incapable of proper social interaction who exercises a blatant disrespect and a chip-on-the-shoulder kind of contempt for the very kind of patrons he is ostensibly hired to make feel welcome seems a self-defeating proposition. Chase this peasant out of there and relegate him to fields he may properly plow, namely scummy 18-and-older trash warehouses in some other dilapidated part of town. He deserves no quarter in this setting. Good burgers though, shame we won't be back.",

The only one I remember someone getting was the Peachtree Street, which was also very good.   Their beer selection is very good as well, and I've definitely had some solid choices on that front in the past.  The food selection is vast and they always have really interesting specials. This week it was a duck burger (awesome.) I opted for the Fried Green Tomato Caprese salad, which was fantastic. Apricot bacon basil mozzarella topped it off, which was heavenly.  The service at Industry can be a little slow and its kinda loud on Fri/Sat nights. Otherwise, its a solid choice in Lawrenceville that I need to remember to go to more.",

The atmosphere is pretty cool with the lighting and exposed brick. I also had to venture into the bathroom to \"assess\" the situation there. Looked pretty clean.  It was late, so we were craving some pub food. The only menu given to us was an appetizer menu so that must be all that is available in the later hours which is understandable. I opted for the pot roast filament fries after seeing a good review about them on here. I also went with the parmesan pop corn because I was pretty famished.  Pot roast fries were everything I had hoped for. The gravy had soaked it's way into the fries and the onion straws added the perfect crunch to the soggy fries. Definitely something you have to eat with a fork unless you want to make a mess of yourself.  The parmesan popped corn was bland though, There really wasn't much flavor and I had to salt it up quite a bit to get it to my liking. Even a quick spritz of sprayed butter would have helped tremendously.  All in all, not a bad experience for 11:30 on a Wednesday night. After we were noticed and given menus, the service was pretty good.",

    "text": "Located on Lawrenceville's cool Butler Street, Industry Public House looks great, very industrial-rustic yet comfortable.  I especially liked the light fixtures.  The huge garage door-style windows are also really neat and unique for the area since, let's face it, PA weather ain't so temperate and thus I imagine the number of days per year the doors (windows) can remain comfortably open is limited.  Lucky for us, the weather during our recent Lawrenceville outing was just right for sitting at a big open window with a sweater, a meal, and a couple drinks.  Food was good, not fantastic but good enough to probably bring us back at some point.  Burgers were tasty, though my burger--or \"burgher\" as they call them here--was ordered medium-rare but arrived with very little pink.  My guy ordered his burger medium and got well done instead.  Overcooking aside, the patty seasoning and toppings and quality of beef were solid.  Husband's fries had an impressive texture, and my simple side salad--greens only; came with no tomatoes, cucumber, etc.--with a sweet house balsamic vinaigrette was satisfying enough.  The best part of our lazy Sunday lunch experience was that our food was free.  After more than 45 minutes of waiting the manager appeared and explained that our ticket had come in behind a large party, presumably the group in the private room nearby.  Manager handled everything professionally and satisfactorily, and we were happy to only have to pay for our drinks, needless to say!  And speaking of the drinks, Husband was impressed with the $4.50 house IPA (said it tasted similar to Sculpin), and at $7 each the couple mimosas I ordered were a decent size and price.  I think it's worth noting that the bathrooms are dark.  Nice, but really dark.  We overheard others mentioning this as well.  Good luck if you have something in your eye or need to fix your make-up.  3 stars for now.",

Another 5 min went by and our waiter finally dropped by with some water. I ordered a White Wiggle Whiskey but it turned out not only had they run out of that type but they had no stocks of Wiggle Whiskey left at all. Lucky for my friend his beer was available yet took nearly 10 mins to arrive at our table.   I had been to Industry Public House before on a Thursday night and had a great time. The place was packed yet the service was great. Not sure what happened this time but it was a definite fail.",

When we arrived, they placed us at a low top table in the back restaurant area. I explained that my reservations were specific. They looked at in their book and realized that they had made a mistake.

Anything on the menu that has pot roast in it is sure to be a good decision--appetizers, entrees, sandwiches. I also love the Lucy furnace, their portobello sandwich.  The most recent time I was here we got a few things off their late night menu, which still included some great choices--pot roast nachos, fries, pizza.  I really like coming here for their large selection of draft beers, at great prices. They have a lot of local options, and change the menu seasonally-great to try new beers. I'm not a whiskey person, but those that are seem to like their smoke stacks-pick your whiskey and wood flavor that the bartender will light on fire to \"infuse\" for you.   It is a surprisingly large venue, with additional seating in a side room, so I've never felt cramped even when it does it busy on a Friday night.",

    "text": "Wow!  This place is beautiful inside!    I feel like this is just what Lawrenceville needed.  A large, casual restaurant with no agenda.  Come one, come all!  The menu is all American, with lots of the faves, burgers, fries, etc.  Main dishes are lobster mac n' cheese (saved for another time fo' sho!), meatloaf, etc.  But the place is huge, with a massive bar in the center and chairs and tables spread out around the outside.  It's something I think Lola was missing... accessible for large groups with a casual atmosphere.    But the shinning star?  The drinks!  The drink list is actually much longer than the menu!  They have a full page devoted to fancy schmancy liquor based bevvies.  A then a couple pages of beer and wine.  It's very impressive!  They all sounded good, even the whiskey one, I'm not even a whiskey fan.  I choose the Carnegie Cucumber.  It was phenomenal.  They served it the right way.  Hendrick's Gin with cucumber.  Most places serve it with a lime, yuck!  The cucumber was actually soaked in gin.  I dare you to eat the whole thing, it's just a slice, but it's potent alone!    For dinner I ordered the Portobello Burger with fries.  Now let me preface this by saying it had all my fave ingredients.  Fresh mozz cheese and a porto soaked in vinegar.  Now I love me some vinegar but I felt like it was a tad too much.  That's a shocking statement for me to say.  But my friend thought hers was great, so maybe I was having an off vinegar night:)  I mean, it was still totally tasty and I ate the whole thing... I just may venture over to something else next time.  Fries were good and fresh and crispy to my liking.    The real thing I had my eye on from the start was this amazing looking birthday cake cocktail.  Forgive me for not remember the name.  Seriously all I can remember is the massive amount of frosting that rimmed my glass... WITH SPRINKLES!  This was my dessert and I enjoyed every alcoholic second!  It was funny to have taste the sweet icing against the strong liquor inside the glass.  Made with the cake batter liquor, it was really incredible and totally worth the splurge.  And by splurge I mean price - 11 bucks a pop - AND calories!    I can imagine this becoming a regular on the Lola circuit for me.  You'll find me in the corner sipping another fancy cocktail!",

It was served with a custom/ homemade Bleu Cheese Dressing with a kick, not was good as the old Buffalo Blue Restuarant in East Liberty!",

I ordered Idustry's Carnegie cucumber cocktail and it was delicious. There was fresh cucumber and elderberry in it.   I was with a few friends and we chose to share a few appetizers. We ordered the industry egg rolls, fries with gorgonzola and truffle oil, the southwest flatbread and mac n' cheese with tasso ham. The egg rolls weren't bad but weren't that great either. I honestly forgot they were ordered until I jogged my memory to write this review. The fries were good but generally anything with cheese and truffle will make people happy. The pizza was the most popular of the items ordered, with corn and spicy chicken, but the menu stated that poblano peppers were on it as well and we could not find any. Lastly, the mac n' cheese could have been good aside from one minor (major) detail. The cheese sauce, tasty. The ham, excellent, the noodles, however, were so overcooked, I couldn't eat them. I would most likely go back but with so many more restaurants in Lawrenceville that have much better food, it won't be anytime soon.",

    "text": "So many mixed reviews about Industry!  Was here for a birthday celebration, and it wasn't crowded for a 9pm reservation for 15 on a Wednesday. We were seated at a nice table by the open window. It was a little breezy, but I had a jacket.  Like others, I am impressed by the draft list--but the prices! $5 for an East End Black Stout? Yes, please! Beer ranges from $4 to $9, and I even saw an 11% ABV Stone Double Bastard Ale for $7. These aren't even the happy hour prices, when from 4:30 - 6:30 pm, everything on tap is $2 off. They also brew three of their own beers, I.P.H., a copper ale, and a hot blast habenero pale ale. They also listed three of Arsenal's ciders, all 8.5% and $9.  For the food menu, there were 3-4 choices that I was stuck between. I've seen the pictures of the handhelds, but then the reviews on the burgers make me want to try those too. I decided on a $13 worker burgher, rare, with sweet potato fries instead of the regular fries. I didn't notice the wait for the food, since our large party's conversation passed the time.   I was SUPER excited seeing my burger! With a cute little toothpick that read \"RARE,\" it seemed like they just knew I was going to take a picture. It was all set up, the top bun on a little tilt so that the juicy patty, super dry goat cheese, mushrooms, and arugula were showing their best side. The sweet potato (in waffle fry form!) had confectioner's sugar sprinkled on top of a few of the rounds. I'll ask for it without sugar next time. Otherwise they were perfectly crunchy and sweet.  The only downside to my first experience at IPH was that I was sitting by a window, so the food got cold quickly in 50 degree nighttime weather. Cold sweet potato fries are still good, but not rare meat. I eat slowly, so I had to box part of that burger.  The service was ok; I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because the party was of 15 and some people came late. They were accommodating. The server may have been a little overwhelmed but he pulled it off.   I tried my friend's foods:  Truffle fries - The potatoes felt like just a vehicle, and it would probably be better on top of something meaty like chicken or a fish. Upgraded pot roast fries - Not extraordinary for the upcharge.  We were a party of ~15, so with tip, my meal came out to $25. I'll come back during happy hour for another stout and a sandwich.",

I was CRAVING a burger and I was incredibly pleased with what I ordered - Farmed Out Burgher with aged white cheddar/wild boar bacon/fried egg/BBQ sauce.  Juicy and flavorful are simply understatements.  I wish I could remember the name of my cocktail - something with scotch and absinthe... delicious!  They also have an incredible craft beer list as well as Arsenal Ciders.  My favorite thing about Industry - other than the decor and food - is the Smokestack.   Take one of your favorite bourbons, drizzle in some maple syrup & throw a few dashes of bitters. Then torch some wood to lightly infuse a fresh smoke to the bourbon.  Try it with cherry, mesquite, apple, maple, or pecan wood!  You cannot go wrong with this drink - and you'll make everyone around you jealous!   When you're in Lawrenceville and looking for incredible drinks with some flavorful food, get a little \"smokey\" at Industry Public House",

The inside has a cool modern \"industry\" feel, but doesn't really invite me in as a spot I'd want to hang out at for more than a sporting event. I suppose that what's it's good for though.  Want a manly drink? They will burn cedar chips over your whiskey to add the smokey taste to a nice drink; Taste like a camp fire! I didn't eat, but friends told me they all loved their food. Even still, the final thought when the check came was \"overpriced\".",

    "text": "We were actually planning a night out at Arsenal Cider House, but they were closed so a friend recommended Industry.  I'm not hipster enough to be hanging out in Lawrenceville (at either location, really) but I was pleasantly surprised by Industry. There was a good mix of clientele, which made me feel less out-of-place.   The beer selection was great, with lots of local choices, but on the expensive side. I had (a few sips of) a $10 dollar cocktail, but it was too much/strong for me. I guess this is good considering it was $10, but I just couldn't get past the flavor. My friends were able to get past it just fine... multiple times. We didn't personally order the smoked whiskey, but a lot of other patrons partook. Fun to watch.   The food however was really hit or miss. My friends ordered burgers and had no complaints, but I got buffalo mac & cheese and it was just downright bad.   All and all, I'd go back if for no other reason than really liking the look/feel of the place + their beer selection.",

Go for a beer when it is quite and bail as soon as the crowds start to arrive.",

An awesome list of speciality drinks.  So when J and I came in on a Sunday afternoon and tried to order two separate beers, I was stunned when they didn't have either one of them.  Why tease your patrons with thinking they can get a big selection if they can't?  Also, J got a burger - which was too peppery - and truffle fries.  $17?!?!  Seriously.  That's just too much.   The good:  I got an awesome salad called the Hand Looper - onions, oyster mushrooms, beets, goat cheese and shallot vinagrette - all awesome.  I added steak which was cooked perfectly.  All in all, awesome.  The dressing was super light, but still really flavorful and it was on a gigantic bed of fresh spinach.    I think I would go back, but it's hard to say.",

    "text": "Been in twice now; once for drinks only and the other time for dins (and the group tried every cocktail on the list). I'll be back. But only for drinks, at least until I feel confident they've had time to work out the kitchen kinks. Allow me to elaborate:   There are positives. Drink menu is totally solid. East End \"house\" brews, good micro draft selection, and plenty of bottles. I'm not a whiskey or bourbon girl, but I tried the wood-chipped smoked concoctions and they are delicious (albeit, seemingly inconsistent based on the bartender. some swirl and others shake the smoke). Bartenders are attentive. It's a cool environment with character.   Then ... there are negatives. It's loud. Super loud. If you're sitting toward the back of the place (near the kitchen), prepare to lose your voice having a conversation.   Aaaaannnd the food:  I ordered the Rooted Burger, after the server tried to sell me on a salad instead (I wanted a burger ... not a salad). It is 100% house made veggie burger, with what the chef explained as a base/binder of zucchini, bulger wheat, and a few other 'root' vegetables. The first burger that came out was cold in the center and essentially a pile of mush, and relatively bland. The server readily took it back, but explained that's why she had tried to sell me on the salad. Well ... alright then.   So the chef comes out to ask me what the deal is with the burger. I kindly explain that it is just mushy, a little cold, and I'd like it cooked through more. He counters that this is the healthiest thing on the menu, it's all housemade, and he just pattied them today. That's all well and good ... I would expect nothing less ... but that doesn't mean it should be mushy. Don't wax poetic on how it's made in house.   A new burger is presented to me. It's clear the fries have just been re-dipped in the oil, because now they're so greasy they slip through my fingers. It's crispier on the outside and hot, which definitely helps. Still needed salt. Chef comes back out to ask how it is, I said it's all good - but spend more time draining the zucchini and figure out the consistency.   Long story short: don't defend the food it it just isn't right. Figure it out. There may be some awesome things on the menu, but right now I think there are a ton of great ideas and a lack of execution. It's not unusual in a new restaurant, but they should trim it back and focus on perfecting a few items ... and go from there.",

The manager was completely disrespectful and told us not to \"yell\" at his employee.  He did not even acknowledge the issue or care. He has no idea how to handle problems or be good at his job.    Therefore, we decided to sit at the bar and eat.  The only savior of this night was the bartender Stacy.  She was amazing and the manager should be really grateful he has her working there.  The food was ok, but my friend's salad was forgotten about and did not arrive till we were more than halfway done with our food and it was obviously tossed together at last minute.

OMGdeliciousscrumptousfingerlickingtrendylookingcomfortableanddidimentionDELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!  I think that may cover it.  This place seems to have a theme for people coming in.  You walk/drive by, see the front of the building, think to yourself 'what is Industry Public House,' throw it in reverse, and venture in.  This is one of those places that you are happy that you entered it.  The feel is industrial like in there, with the pulley system used for lighting, exposed brick, steel beams used for some of the hightops and the dark wood accents just right.  We were greeted and seated by the general manager.  First time I was ever at a restaurant and the general manager actually introduced himself and brought us our drinks.  Big thumbs up for you sir.  It took a while to browse the menu, but they were happy to let us do that, the staff was not there to rush us in any way.  When we finally decided on what we wanted it was a breeze after that.  Ordered the build to order nachos for the appy, so fresh, so good, so mouthwatering.  The mixture of food on that one plate alone was enough to convince me that this was a repeat place for me.  And we haven't even gotten to the main fare yet.  Back to the mixture of flavors, I had no clue black beans and pineapple could taste so good together...ok, I'll stop about that already.  Onto what i ordered for my main course, since it was lunch time I opted for one of their burgers.  I chose the Farmed Out burger.  The prochetta and BBQ sauce was amazing, not to mention the wild boar bacon.  The bun being toasted was amazing, fresh lettuce, tomato and onion...I did not need to add anything to this burger, just a napkin to catch the overflow of flavor.  The order of fries that come with it says 'fresh cut...'  I know what you are thinking.  But these were truly fresh cut...Reminded me of Potato Patch fries in Kennywood.  The taste was just so good, can tell they are not frozen at all.  Going for lunch here on a Saturday was an excellent idea.  Wasn't packed, staff was very friendly, and we could take our time in there without being rushed.  I also love the way they serve the water to you in a corked glass bottle, and they leave it for you so you don't have to wait for the inevitable moment when your mouth is full and the waitress asks if you need anything.  I'll definitely return here, maybe in the night time to check it out and see what crowds are like for the bar.",

It took 40 mins to come to our table during which our server only came by once to tell us it would be out in a few minutes.. 20 mins of it we could see a bunch of dishes just sitting under the heat lamps. When our meals finally came the bagels were rock hard - as in it hurt our teeth to eat it. The fries and the eggs were only luke warm.   I am a vegetarian so I asked for the meat to come on the side so my mom could still eat my bacon portion... Well they clearly forgot and picked the meat off afterwards cause it had residue on it. Lucky for them I'm not that anal about my food but in the vegetarian world that is a huge no-no!  Will never go back!",

Its name speaks to the place; industrial, modern decor, dark, good mood lighting and atmosphere... 2/3 of the space is a bar, the other 1/3 is a dining room. Service is bad, but I suppose to someone in their 20's it may seem okay, but I have higher expectations when I go out nowadays.  The hostess asked if my boyfriend and I were okay sitting at a high top table in the bar for dinner. I said that I'd rather sit in the dining room where it is a bit quieter. She said that she only had 6 tops in there, I looked and there were four 6 tops! (yes, 24 seats), so I asked if we could just use one because my boyfriend has to give himself insulin and has an accessed port (permanent IV for his illness cystic fibrosis) and we'd rather not sit right next to someone in the bar , again she said she'd rather not sit us there because she'd have to turn away a party of 6 (I suppose if four of them showed up in the next hour and were unwilling to wait). So I said we were leaving and she gave us one (we should have left).   The food was blah. So bad in fact that I didn't eat it and left to go to another restaurant. Instant mashed potatoes and enhanced chicken. I asked if I could have a salad instead of the veggie, waiter said no problem. So he brings me a bowl of lettuce. I asked if they put anything on their salads, he said that it would be an up charge. I told him that I assumed a salad was more than lettuce and had I been informed that I needed to pay for salad \"toppings\" I would have paid for it instead of being served a bowl of lettuce.   The place seems nice, but the staff try way too hard to be hip and trendy that it comes off tacky.  The space is nice, I think the wait staff just need to be a little more down to earth. Go here if you want to drink with friends, but I would steer clear for dinner.",

    "text": "I have a love-hate relationship with Industry. It can be the most obnoxious spot in Pittsburgh if you come at the wrong time. It's a very cool, industrial-style bar with a lot of bar space and additional tables. However, there are sports broadcast on like eight different TVs at all times, which is fine, but wow..it can get so loud and \"bro\" ish. Every time I come during prime time (weekend evenings), there is always one group of people who get obnoxiously drunk, and I've learned to accept that's just the clientele of Industry. It's like a little piece of South Side in Lawrenceville. (Ever been to Local in Southside? This is Lawrenceville's version.) Also, the wait can get CRAZY on weekends.  That being said, I love this place for lunch or happy hour. They have a great great great whiskey, beer, and cocktail selection. (Though I wish they carried more local beers!!!) There is something for everyone as far as drinks go. I loved their summer cocktail menu these last few months.  The food is not too bad. It's nothing special - sometimes it's meh, sometimes it's outstanding. There is one sandwich I got once that I sent back - I think it was the shaved roast beef sandwich? It was inedible. Avoid at all costs.  Brunch should be avoided here as well. The brunch service is very slow and the menu overwhelming.  Overall, if you're looking for an interesting-looking place with some good whiskey or beer, and standard bar food, this is a safe bet. Just be sure to come early in the evening. ;)",

Even though they were about to begin their busy Saturday evening rush and were full with reservations, they gave us a table since we said we'd just be having a quick drink and a snack to wait out the storm. The candied bacon was to die for, as were the Verdigris cocktails. We received excellent friendly service with a smile from our server (Jennifer), and were most impressed with the space overall. Great find! If I ever visit Pittsburgh again, I will come back.",

They lite wood chips above the drink to get the smoky flavor. All of the drinks though are really good, and the bartender will always help you find one that you will be sure to like. The food is more typical american pub food, but with a little twist. All of the flatbread are awesome, and even though they are an appetizer, I couldn't finish the whole thing. I have also tried the mac and cheese, and it was nothing short of delicious. Definitely big enough to split! If you are in the Lawrenceville area, this is a great dinner spot!",

Drinks: sad to say I haven't had a cocktail here because I haven't been able to distract myself from the beer. Love the smoked whiskey presentation so I'll definitely have to try it. Looking at the cocktail list, there's a lot on there is like to try.  Food: excellent. Burgers, truffle fries, nachos, bacon. All hail a meat haven here. Popcorn was good, bit I don't think worth it on the appetizer list. Small bowl...come on, popcorn is meant to be shared!  I attended a beer pairing for Yards brewing a few months back. This was done really well! Fun way to try their selection and have the brewmasters explain and the food paired was excellent. I think it was around $40? All in all a great deal and lots of fun.   Most recently I was  there for a bachelorette party. All of the above was intact, but what I want to comment the most was the service. OUTSTANDING! 10 girls, 9?checks, great table by the open window (god, I'm going to be sad when it's winter in Pittsburgh), food delivered promptly. All in all the food is good, the beer is good, the atmosphere is good...but when you have excellent service, the whole experience is awesome. I'm a jerk for not referencing our server's name because I can't remember it. She was great.   I'll return...someone slip me the cocktail menu before the beer so I can try something new.",

    "text": "You know how you felt about the Buccos prior to this season? Like, you kept going to games, because you know in your heart there's something you love, but every time, they lost, and you went home feeling a little pang of heartbreak?  That's kind of how I feel about Industry.  I've been a handful of times now, and each time it is *almost* so good that I can't wait to go back. Buuuuuuuut not really.  Okay. Let me try to explain it this way: I order a small plate. It arrives. I'm super pumped! I love small plates! I take the first bite - damn, that's good! Second bite - oh wow, still good, but this is so rich! Third bite - oh, who cares how rich it is, it's delicious! Fourth bite - OH I AM STUFFED I CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER BITE.  Like, HOW DOES THIS HAPPEN ALL THE TIME?? WHERE IS MODERATION?  Every time. Every time, I am so excited to eat here, and then I take one bite too many and I'm just done.  If you're a beer-drinker, they've got a ton of variety. I don't do the beer thing, so I stick to their cocktail menu, which is quite nice. I particularly like the fresh-fruit-based drinks like the Rhuby Rhuby Rhuby and Fisheye. The Smokestack is their signature cocktail, and while it's majestic to watch in production, it's not my favorite to drink.  Service has consistently been good, although we've only ever sat at the bar.  My favorite food choices thus far have been the mushroom & goat cheese flatbread and the bacon. Those were the best balance of flavor and not-making-you-feel-like-Mr.-Creosote-ness. I am in serious love with the filament truffle fries, BUT only the first two bites. After that, I want to slip into a food coma and sleep it off.  Industry's all right by me. I'm starting to learn my limits there, so I don't mind popping in from time to time. A round and a small plate split between a few friends - that's a decent reason to come back.",

The space was nice, and though I normally do not like bar stools, I found these to be pretty comfortable and the tables where a good height for me when I chose not to sit down to be able to still eat and drink without problems. Also I don't suggest this for a first or second date when you are trying to get to know someone because it is loud, but they also have an awesome selection of music, which is fun to sing along to.   Our waitress was great.  Sometimes she would forget something, but always realized when she returned to the table and immediately retrieved it.   The cocktail list is wonderful and I had a Cohesion which was like a kicked up last word which is one of my favorite cocktails!  They also have Aresenal cider on tap which my hubby partook in.   The food is the real knockout though! We ordered the Blast Pig Burger and the Cluck House with the express understanding that we where sharing.  Though the cluck house was delicious and very well made it may as well have not existed after the first bite of the Blast Pig Burger. This was literally the best burger either of us has ever eaten in our lives! I loved it.  It was perfectly cooked and the best amalgamation of toppings I could have ever thought up.  I can't wait to go back, and normally I would say try more of the menu, but chances are it will be very hard to get me away from ordering this most perfect burger.  We also ordered the donut holes for dessert.  The donuts where delicious. They where perfect.  They where also huge and I still have a few hanging out for a snack today.  Go here! It is worth it!",

Usually we stop for a coffee and cupcake at Dozens and explore the quirky shops. This day, we happened to be starving and were on the lookout for a place to eat. As soon as I saw the Industry Public House and looked inside I wanted to check it out, and I'm so happy I did!  My husband is a huge craft beer fanatic and his eyes popped when he saw the number of taps! Im sure he tried two or three with his meal - I didn't keep count.   Right away, I LOVED the fact that I had several vegetarian options to choose from. I was between the Company Salad (mixed greens, granny smith apples, gorgonzola, dried cranberries, red onion, candied pecans and balsamic vinaigrette) and the Lucy Furnace. Being on vacation, the indulgent side of me won and I went with the Lucy Furnace sandwich (portabella, tempura zucchini, watercress, chard sweet onion and ricotta salata). Holy smokes was it good!!   Surprisingly, my husband ordered the macaroni and cheese - which he dubbed \"the best he's ever had\". My mom will be upset. Thanks a lot Industry Public House.",

The employees were chatting with each other, playing on their phones, making themselves coffee, etc. After exactly half an hour, a girl who I don't think was even a bartender asked me if I needed anything so I just got the check.

    "text": "As someone who isn't in Lawrenceville super frequently, it took me a while to eat at Industry Public House. But I finally stopped in one night before catching a movie at the local little movie theater. I almost walked into a little pizza place instead, but the interior of  Industry - with its wooden beams and decor - was so beautiful and inviting that I had to give it a try. The place was admittedly exceptionally loud, seeing as I stopped in on a busy Friday night. Not the kind of place I'd go to if I wanted to talk to my friends or date at all. But since I was a single diner that night, it didn't matter that much to me.  The menus caught my attention as much as the decor, seeing as they consist of strips of paper that are brought out on a little clipboard. And people definitely take the menus apart and reorganize them during their visits - the sheet with the appetizers was stuck in the bottom of the stack of the menu that I got. But I forgot about that pretty quickly when I saw just how massive the list of drink options was. I could have browsed through that for ten minutes, easily. I didn't though, because as soon as I saw the arsenal cider options I was set!  After sorting through the out-of-order food menu I ended up ordering a Worker Burgher - a $13 burger that comes with goat cheese, caramelized onions, arugula, mushrooms and herb aioli. I was also able to order a surprisingly flavorful side salad at no extra charge - yay! Unfortunately, despite its high price the burger was admittedly just ok. It tasted fine enough; it wasn't terrible at all (and on an unrelated note, I noticed the meat was shaped in a square patty, not a circular one). But at this point we've definitely been spoiled enough by burger boutiques in Pittsburgh that I wasn't very wowed with what I got. Especially for how much it cost - at that price, they could have added way more of the toppings to help add to the flavor of the whole burger, especially given how big the bun was.  So, will I be back to Industry? At some point, probably - the drink menu was impressive, and even though my main course was slightly disappointing in comparison to other places in the city, it tasted ok enough. And the service was stunning. On a busy Friday night where the place was jam packed I only waited ten minutes for my food. I was out the door in well under an hour with time to spare to make my evening plans. Those waiters, waitresses and kitchen staff have a tight run ship and it's honestly enough for me to elevate my rating. So yeah: I'd be ok coming back here sometime to see if another item on the menu impresses me more. Plus, I'll definitely need to enjoy more of that impressive drink menu!",

We liked the vibe ( Industrial, duh) and it wasn't too busy or loud, and the muszak was varied and good ( although we got Rick rolled! Lol).  We thought the menu was imaginative and the food actually tasted as good as it sounded, which is not always the case. My wife said her Worker burger was among the best burgers she's ever had, and she's kinda picky. The fish and chips portion was HUUUUGE!  They had a very extensive brew menu, and 3 cider choices!  The staff was attentive and friendly but not overbearing. Would def come back and try it again.  Cheers and thank you!!",

We went for dinner on a Saturday night, and it was pretty busy (a good sign). Overall, the experience was fine. We were tended to promptly, although our server was a bit socially awkward (which is fine, it just threw me off sometimes). The beer selection was good, the food came out quickly, and our friend were right, it was actually *good* bar food.   One thing I didn't like is that it was pretty loud... which is fair, given that we went on Saturday night, but it did make talking to our friends a little difficult. Plus it was on the pricier side, even for *good* bar food (unless, of course, you love bar food, in which case you might think the prices are reasonable).  Decent overall experience, but we'd probably try other places the next time we visit.",

Came here for my 30th birthday and thought it was pretty neat; especially watching the bartender prepare the \"Smokestack\" several times and smelling that awesome cherry and maple wood! Definitely a nostalgic smell for me and enjoyed it.   I ended up having three drinks; the Rhuby Rhuby, a French 75 (not on the menu, but they'll make it if you ask) and one of the whiskies. All 3 were delicious.   Cons: Like other reviewers mention it is LOUDDD. Don't expect to have an intimate conversation here. One of the hostesses was also less-than-friendly. There was no acknowledgement or even a hello when I walked in....I basically just said there would be 4 of us and the 2 girls talked amongst themselves and then led me to a table. Not necessarily the first feeling you want to get from a business upon arrival. I'd go back here but I'd sit at the bar for a different experience and maybe try some food.",

    "text": "Went here to grab some drinks and a couple of apps. We were waited on by Alex, who was the most wonderful waiter we have had in a long time (even though he's a Giant's fan, as evidenced by the tattoo on his arm).   We ordered 4 drinks. My husband is a novice whiskey drinker, so he asked Alex for a recommendation. Alex suggested the Union Bushel, which had a hint of sweetness and included bruleed apple as a garnish. It ended up being a great starter drink; my husband had 2 of them. He also ordered 6 hot wings with ranch and blue cheese on the side. I'd say the wings were 3.5/5 stars. The blue cheese dipping sauce was outrageous. It was as though they put a scoop of chunky blue cheese in the dish and added dressing and hot sauce. It was pinkish in color and tasted phenomenal. It was the perfect touch for the hot wings.  Alex talked me into the shrimp bisque, which, unlike most bisques, had chunks of shrimp in it. It was thick, creamy, and topped with chives. Very delicious, and warmed me right up in these low temps.  I ordered the Rhuby Rhuby Rhuby as a drink and also enjoyed an extra dirty martini. They were made to perfection and, although it took awhile for them to come out, due to a shift change, it was well worth the wait.  The bathrooms were clean, although I froze my buns off both in the bathrooms, and at our table. We concluded, that due to the brick walls, it was probably difficult to insulate. We put in an order in for fried pickles that we did not receive, but wrote this one off as a sign from God telling us to not order anymore food, as we had a Valentine dinner ahead of us.  Seems like a great spot for meeting up with friends, and we will most definitely try to come back soon.",

    "text": "3.5 stars, rounding up to four.   Industry Public House in Lawrenceville is a really cool spot. They tout themselves as a prohibition-themed spot, but I don't really get that vibe with a super modern bar setup. Regardless, they have an amazingly expansive alcohol selection, including some good wine options, which can be a challenge to find at \"beer places.\" I find the TV screens with social beer info (I think it is an app) like glass type, keg level, etc. to be a really cool touch and helpful for people to really get a feel for what they are about to order.  I have tried a few foods and they have all been generous portions and super tasty. Bar food, but more upscale. However, I will say that the ahi tuna I had was so spicy I could barely eat it and no spice was indicated on the menu description, so I am curious if other dishes are not super accurately described.  Despite being very large with a larger than average bar, this place is usually packed. Granted, I've always ventured there on a weekend night, but even early on, it's crowded. My main issue with IPH and the reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the service/details. While some of the staff members are super helpful and great, more of them seem to have an attitude problem--the hostesses in particular. I'll never forget the time I came in after having shoulder surgery (I was in a huge sling with a pillow stabilizer) and the hostess wouldn't even entertain the idea of finding me and my boyfriend (so a two-top) a table away from the crowd so I wouldn't get bumped. I've also gotten an \"eye roll\" vibe from a lot of the bartenders. The restroom is nicely appointed, but typically in disarray without TP, soap etc. If IPH pays a little bit more attention to details like customer service, it could work its way up to 5 stars in my book!",

We ordered the pig iron because it sounded interesting, but it's really just thick cut bacon. Good pairing for the Mac and cheese flatbread though. Ordered the fish and chips on a separate occasion- huge piece of fish with crispy batter, definitely worth it.  Brunch:  Ordered corned beef hash and French toast. French toast was fairly standard, although the cinnamon butter on top was delicious. Corned beef hash was slices of beef, peppers and onions on top of home fries. It made a good breakfast sandwich with the English muffin and egg, but wish the flavors of the hash itself were better incorporated (i.e. the potatoes and beef were sauteed together, instead of assembled after).  Service generally good, seated quickly each time. Slightly chilly inside.",

We ordered the Farmed Out Burger (minus the BBQ sauce), the Southern fried chicken, and a side of mac & cheese. Although the burger was salty, I still enjoyed it. Fries were also pretty salty. There was a lot of heavy seasoning on the Southern fried chicken, but I thought it totally worked and it was some of the best fried chicken I've ever had. Loved the cheddar chive grits too. Although the burger and fries were normal portion size, the Southern fried chicken came in a huge portion. We were pretty hungry, but could only finish about 70% of the food!

However it gets quite loud in the evenings. I've also had a few bad servers, but overall positive experiences. They have a large draft list as well with great beer selection.",

    "text": "I was very afraid I would not like Industry Public House.  I'm on board with the craft beers for sure.  But \"artisanal cuisine\"?  \"Industrial cocktails\"?  Ugh, this sounds pretty hipster.  Being located in Lawrenceville did not help the sale.  But they have an amazing craft beer, whiskey and cocktail selection.  So I had to give it a try.  I've been here on a few occasions and I seem to time it just right.  I've been there when it's pretty empty or scored a table shortly before the place fills up.  It's a beautiful huge space.  But it's also popular.  If you don't want a long wait, timing is definitely key.  If you're just there for a couple cocktails and not worried about crowds or waits, then it doesn't really matter.  Just know that service at the bar is usually pretty slow when it's busy.  My first time here, I met a friend for dinner around 6pm on a Saturday.  We were immediately seated at a table by the bar.  The menu isn't pages long, but it's exciting enough that it we weren't sure what to go with.  So we ordered a bunch of appetizers thinking we'd order food later.  I was eyeing up that Farmed Out Burgher as my main course.  My friend went with the popped corn and candied bacon, I went with the pot roast fries.  The serving of fries, as an appetizer, was way more than I expected.  And that gravy, oh that gravy....so delicious.  And it's not that I didn't want that Burgher, I just couldn't eat another bite after finishing those fries.  And one of the fried chicken livers my friend ordered that I just had to try.  We had a few cocktails, my favorite being the Rhuby Rhuby Rhuby.  I noticed over the summer that they have updated their menu because another one of my favorites, the Flux Capacitor, is no longer available.  The Smokestack, their signature cocktail, is made to your liking with your choice of bourbon and wood chip.    I haven't been back for food, but I have returned for cocktails.  Every time I've been able to score a seat at the bar.  It can get loud with the music and TVs.  But I just had another cocktail and ignored it.  Random side note: Industry Public House may have my favorite bathroom in the city.  Despite my reservations, Industry Public House exceeded my expectations.  It might seem a little pricey, but I think it was worth it, especially for the food and creative cocktails.  I won't hesitate to stop in again for a cocktail and finally get one of those burgers.",

Definitely try their smokestack, which is whiskey infused with wood smoke, it's a pretty cool variation on drinking whiskey. Their food is creative and delicious, we had summer rolls, chili, lobster grilled cheese, and the Blast Pig Burger - which has jalapenos, candied bacon, and lots of other good stuff on a burger with a nice soft bun (probably brioche?). Industry is spacious with lots of seating and a long bar so it's great for groups, but can be pretty loud. Really great place in a booming neighborhood!",

We were pleasantly surprised when we got there around 7 and were told the wait was only going to be around 30-40mins (previous reviews estimated the wait to be over an hour.) We were able to find two seats at the bar pretty quickly and ordered a couple beers while we waited for the table to open. We tried the IPH Copper Ale and Troegs First Cut, both were great! I stuck with beer, but they also had a whole list of mostly whiskey based cocktails which seemed to be their specialty. There was a mix up with phone numbers at the hostess booth so we missed our table and ended up having to wait an extra half hour. This was disappointing but when we said something they resolved the issue quickly and we were able to be seated shortly after that. For the main course we had the smoke stack sandwich and the workers burgher. We were really impressed with the food! We started with the fried pickles and had upgraded sides of truffle fries and brussel sprouts which really made the meal great. I also ordered a Moscow mule with my dinner and it was one of the better ones I've had, the bartenders know what they're doing. We want to come back to try more from the draft list and the industrial sized soft pretzel. Yum!",

The place was virtually empty and I ended up at a corner wooden table. I asked the waitress for recommendations and she told me the macaroni and cheese was exceptional. I thought that would be just too much with my stopping in at various businesses to sample their cookies so I asked for a salad. She recommended to me the 9th Ward salad which consisted of cooked salmon, kale, blackberries, green apples, and barley with a ginger vinaigrette dressing.  I found the service slow for a time of day when not too many people were in there but eventually got my salad.I received a generous portion. It was very good but spicy hot so I definitely needed plenty of water to drink. The place is a bit pricey with my salad alone running $16.00 so I figured that if I come in the future just to plan ahead for it. There weren't too many people at the bar but most I saw were drinking beer. I opted to forgo dessert since I was continuing my cookie tour and nibble from that.  My True rating would have been 3 1/2 stars but normally I round up when I'm not certain. Located in the heart of the business district it is not that difficult to find.",

The waitress did not come around too often so I can't comment too much on the staff in general.  I was just happy with the food.

I've tried a little bit of everything from the menu from apps to salads to entrees to burgers... all have been solid. All of their burgers and sandwiches are solid, and although I don't do it personally, they have an array of add-ons (for the fries as well).  They have a huge beer selection, some more reasonable than others, and I'm never around Lawrenceville for Happy Hour. If you're a bourbon fan, you have to try the Smoke Stack at least once, but they do have some wonderful cocktails as well.  I remember when they first opened how packed it would be (which, for it's original size was impressive), but since the expansion, I'm still amazed how packed it can get. Which leads to my personal downside... the noise. The entire place is steel and sealed brick, which means it gets loud rather fast.",

Artists selling pottery on the sidewalk, new commercial ventures evolving out of dilapidated industrial lofts, people teeming everywhere trying new places and tastes. Industrial Public House at the heart of Butler Street, beats a steady stream of flavor and beer, fueling the Cultural Renaissance of Pittsburgh.  The large space of Industry is great for groups, though you may have a hard time getting your waiter's or bartenders attention. I'm not sure if it's because of the crazy amount of people that frequent the pub or if it's the ear splitting acoustics that make it impossible to have a conversation. My thoughts...a little of column A and a little of column B. Industry is probably the worst kept secret in Lawrenceville, but for good reason.   But let's get to it, the drink selection is Epic! Whether you're a beer lover or a cider snob (like this classy lady), Industry has you covered. When you get hungry, and you know you will, their menu has both surprised  and intrigued this seasoned Yelper. Most of the food has been excellent; however, sometimes the complexity or ambition of the plate seems to overwhelm the chef leading to a smothered Croquet Madam.  I recommend visiting on an off night or an early brunch. And stick with the basics - a delicious burger or banging French toast.",

We were there ultimately to just get drinks, but my fiance' and I ended up sharing the blast pig burger and pot roast fries. Oh my, am I ever glad we did. The burger was probably the best I've had in the city. Even better than Burgatory or Winghearts. The candied bacon they put on top of the burger was incredible. And the pot roast fries, oh my goodness...you'll never have fries that are this good. I'm really glad we shared because the burger was huge and there were soooo many fries.  Their beer selection is wonderful as well. And the restaurant itself is gorgeous. The only downside is the prices are relatively high for burgers and sandwiches. I think our Blast Pig Burger was $15.

The sliders are served three ways: pulled pork, pot roast, or lobster. I originally chose the pulled pork but was steered toward the pot roast at the final moment.   They come three to an order and aren't sissy sliders like served by some restaurants around town. These sliders mean business, think a little smaller than a glazed donut.  The pot roast sliders come on a potato roll which is soft and chewy. The pot roast itself is tender and moist and comes topped with a mashed potato cake. I some how missed the mashed potato cake during the first slider but was beyond pleasantly surprised when I bit into during the second. The mashed potatoes were creamy and made every bit thereafter feel like a home cooked meal Mom made.  I enjoyed these sliders so much in fact that I seriously considered ordering another round. I didn't, but I probably should have...",

Not only is it entertaining to watch, but damn, does it make you thirsty for some smoke-treated whiskey. Really.  The atmosphere is so lovely; dark, but not too dark, great televisions if you're trying to watch a game, comfy bar-stools (even though they don't look it) and enough room to breathe.

The waiter also seemed overwhelmed for lunch hour with barely tables filled. Every single time I've been here, it just hasn't been worth it. Did I mention it's $2.00 extra for a neat or rocks pour of liquor? When I asked how else you would order a drink, the waiter said it's a 2.0 oz pour verses a 1.5 pour and they have \"fancy ice cubes\" that take a lot of labor. When we ordered a rocks drink, it didn't even come with this so called fancy ice cube. I don't recommend this place. Maybe for a drink but definitely not food.",

The quality of the food is solid.  The menu selection contains basically pub-food items, but the quality is much better than you would find at most pubs.  I love their Management Burgher and Farmed Out Burgher!  But I'm sure ALL of their burgers are great, so of course pick the one with the toppings you like best (you can also customize by adding and upgrading toppings).  My various dining partners have also enjoyed their Reuben and the salads.  The alcohol selection is huge.  Their draft list is pretty decent, and although it's nowhere near as good as the selection at Fat Heads or D's, there are usually at least 2-3 beers that I like on the list -- to put this in context, I am very picky about beers and almost exclusively drink IPAs, stouts, and sours (and variants of those).  Their cocktails are inventive and the selection is extensive, but they don't hold a candle to the ones across the street at Tender.  All in all, this place is a great new addition to Lawrenceville.  I will warn that it gets *very* crowded and loud on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday nights and develops much more of a party scene.  On weeknights, it's a lot more mellow.",

    "text": "Industry has so much going for it: Good beer selection, creative cocktails, a fun NYE atmosphere, and delicious food made with quality ingredients. I've been here multiple occasions for Sunday brunch, late dinner, and just drinks, and I've had a mostly positive experience overall. Sunday brunch in particular has been an overwhelmingly positive experience. The space is so nice and large and it's much less crowded than in the evenings, which makes ordering food less of a headache.  The problems with Industry are primarily ones of consistency and service. For example, I've ordered the same two orders of fries on separate occasions and had them come out vastly different from one another. One order was warm but the fries were nasty little bits of potato and the oil they had been cooked in seemed very old. The other was much more generous and tasted freshly prepared, but the fries themselves came out room temperature at best. It was as if they'd been dumped onto the plate in all their delicious glory but then left sitting in the open for five minutes. I think having a few more dedicated food runners would solve this particular problem instantly.   Additionally, ordering food anytime after 8:00 pm is a convoluted and confusing process that everyone I've come to Industry with (myself included!) has yet to understand. I've been sitting at a table with a group who was handed menus after we'd expressed a desire to order food, only to have the server curtly tell us to go place our food orders at the bar once he returned and we attempted to order. Other times (later at night mind you) my group has been permitted to order from our table via the server without a hitch. If the food ordering policy was made more explicitly clear (like stated at the top of the food menu) I think the confusion would be largely eliminated. As it currently stands, the inconsistency in the quality of the food and the lack of clarity about ordering said food makes me not want to order any of the more expensive dinner dishes or burgers here. I don't want to shout my order to the bartender and have it come out wrong or pay $15 for a cold burger. I'm hoping the longer Industry stays open the smoother things will become.",

Lots of tvs, but it's not really a sports bar, so that's a little confusing to me. It doesn't seem to fit to me, but I'm sure the guys like being able to keep an eye on the scores. My biggest issue with this place (which is not an issue with the business) is that it gets SO packed at peak times. They have a very large bar area, but when it's busy, there is no place to sit and there are people everywhere. I don't mean a little crowded, it's packed. Some people like that, especially the younger crowds, but that's my only critique.  A nice place for a cool dinner out on the town. Good food, not super fancy, definitely a relaxed atmosphere. Reasonable prices for the food -- I've never had anything bad and the portions are a good size. Their smokestack drinks are worth trying. Some are good, some are not, but it's a neat quirk of theirs.",

They have some great cocktails and extensive collection of straight liquor. The menu is upgraded pub grub. The servers and bartenders are friendly. And the decor and ambiance are what one would expect of a place called Industry. Plus they have lots of TV's showing sports. Yes, folks in Lawrenceville are still allowed to like sports.  Let's start with the cocktails. They have one called the Smokestack, where they take whiskey, add a couple other ingredients and then torch some wood and let the smoke infuse into the drink. The differences betwixt the woods are discernible. I believe my friends liked the mesquite the best.  Now, on to the truffle fries. Get separate orders or rue the fact that you have to share with others. As we happily munched on our truffle fries one evening, we also looked longingly at another group that had ordered the nachos, which came out piled up at least half foot high with fixin's. (or a more realistic but still high measurement). The burghers (their spelling) are quite good. But last time I ordered a cajun chicken sandwich which came with habanero jack cheese. It was hot. Ridiculous hot. I'm South Asian; my people live for heat. This was hot.  As for ambiance and service. I've been quite pleased with the level of attentiveness at the bar. Things might take a smidge longer if you're sitting at one of the high tables; still not that bad. The place does get a bit crowded on a weekend night but, well, if you're expecting a quiet, unobtrusive night, why are you out at a place with the words \"Public House\" in its name?",

    "text": "While I haven't had a change to try IPH's food, their drinks are easily some of the best in the city.  Great selection of drafts, cocktails, and whisky/bourbon/scotch, etc.  They have an in-house line of contract brews (the IPA is pretty good) and I'd highly suggest trying the smokestack (signature drink) or the smoked bacon bourbon drink (can't remember the name).  Not a ton of tables, but the bar itself is absolutely massive (occupying easily 50% of the venue).  I definitely plan on heading back for food the next time I'm in the Lawrenceville area though as every time it has smelt/looked fantastic!",

    "text": "We came back again to IPH for a night of cocktails.  Fort Duquesne: Delicious! A great complexity of flavors. Aviation Gin, champagne, lemon, cranberry, and thyme. Menlo Park: Just as great as the last time we were here. Aviation Gin, lime, simple syrup, and flamed rosemary. It was awesome to see the rosemary lit on fire right in front of us. Whiskey Remedy: A taste of this will warm your soul.  Next time, we will be going for one of their Smokestack cocktails. They torched different wood chips right over a glass of whiskey, then cupped the top so the smoke would infuse right in.  Their draft list is also the best we have seen in Pittsburgh.  If you're looking for appetizers, try the Buffalo Mac n Cheese flatbread. Great wings as well.",

    "text": "Great place for cocktails or grabbing a casual bite to eat. Cool atmosphere and anywhere they light drinks on fire is fine by me. I got wine this time around but they were mixing up all sorts of crazy cocktails at the bar (burning wood chips over bourbon, you know the fancy stuff). Extensive beer selection. Our food selections turned out amazing. We started with fries topped with pot roast and gravy. Then, I got a burger (covered with goat cheese, mushrooms, caramelized onions & arugula) with a side salad. Clearly, I wasn't making healthy choices that evening but it was well worth it.  Will be going back soon!",

    "text": "We checked out Industry yesterday for the first time for lunch.  For a Sat lunch they were packed, possibly due to the Pens game that was on.  We did not order any drinks, so while they do seem to have an impressively large drink menu (especially beers and whiskeys) I can not comment on that, but only the food.  The special of the day was one pound of wings for half price, so my husband, got a pound of wings with the dry rub.  My husband normally prefers buffalo wings (which they do have) but did say they have a good dry rub.  I got the Lucy sandwich, a roasted veggie sandwich with cheese and a vinaigrette on it.  The sandwich was good, but messy as the vinaigrette sauce was runny and just seemed to get everywhere.  Instead of the fries that come with the sandwich, I got a side of mac and cheese instead.  The mac and cheese was great.  Very cheesy.  Almost wished I had gotten an entree size serving of mac and cheese.  We also got the loaded fries to split.  The loaded fries come with bacon and cheddar cheese on them.  I would have liked more cheese on them, but the fries were good.  The service was lacking.  Granted, I know they were busy, but my husband had to wait 5-10 minutes for his soda, and we had to even remind our server about it.  When we finally paid the check we again had to wait 5-10 min for the waiter to even come back around to pick it up so we could leave.  Overall I think the place has a nice concept, just needs better service.",

Surveying the room, we didn't see anyone working or hustling and a lot of tables looking frustrated without food and empty glasses. No one running food or drinks and no water people. No thanks, I know a poorly managed restaurant when I see one!",

The service was phenomenal and the food was really good. I had the fat gary but brown by east end brewery and the pot roast. I like that they had local brews. It is a little bit on the more expensive side, but it is worth the money.",

Both were very good. Thanks for your hospitality! It was great to see the positive changes happening in PBG since I was there last. Keep it going!",
