    "text": "My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night. You can gat a \"burger\" (beef, chicken, portabella, or turkey) in a bun with lettuce for a buck. Then you can add toppings to complete your burger at a small cost-cheese 75 cents, veggies 50 cents, Artery Cloggers 75 cents, sauce 25 cents. Those are the headings and they have items listed under them-like 9 different cheeses. You can also get a basket of tots or fries for a small price as well.  My burger was $2.25 after I added toppings. Is it the best burger I've ever had? No. But is it the best $2.25 burger I've ever had?  Yes. It's kind if a Russian roulette as to how your burger will come to you cooked. Mine was well done and one if my son's burger had pink in the middle. We probably could have sent it back but we don't mind a little pink.  I love the tater tots!  They are crispy and have the right amount of salt. Yummy!! Our server was great and we'll definitely be back.",

But, when Betty barkeep remediated the situ and fetched all of the toppings initially ordered, the burger and portabella were worth the wait. And gimme some more o' dem tots yo! Straight up addictive with salt + pepper and a hint o' lime. Bar Louis is showing its age, but it has been an anchor at the ever-changing Waterfront.",

We got loaded nachos as an appetizer and all the toppings were as fresh as they come, not to mention delicious!  I ordered pasta (I cannot remember the name) but I asked for no artichokes in it. It turned out the artichokes were pre-mixed in the recipe, but the waitress came and informed us that the chef was whipping up a special batch just for me! I was extremely grateful and impressed.  Everything was delicious, the decor was industrial chic (which I love) and the atmosphere was buzzing and fun. The menu was a tad exotic for my small-town pallet, but it was great. My only complaint was the fact that you had to seat yourself, because we wandered around the crowded restaurant for about 10 minutes before we found a seat. The food and service certainly made up for it though!",

It was my husband's birthday and we decided to get a large group together to go out. It was also the Pens/Capitals Game 7 the night we planned to go out. I called another establishment (Rock Bottom) and asked for 11 seats reserved in the bar area to watch the game. They stated they don't do reservations in the bar area (even though I was basically bringing 11 people to drink and eat in excess of 4 hours) so I ended up calling Bar Louie. They were fantastic They reserved us a table and even had it right by a television so we could watch the game. The waitress did a great job serving 11 of us and keeping track of all the drinks and food we ordered (some of which was 1/2 off for happy hour for some of the time) I would definitely recommend this place for large groups and parties to anyone after the wonderful experience we had. Thanks to much to the staff and managers and bartenders at Bar Louie Waterfront~!",

Tip: if you sit behind the taps, no one will bother to acknowledge you exist. When we moved seats, we were finally asked what we would like to drink after waiting for 5+ minutes in our original seats. It wasn't all that busy, either. Most of the people sitting at the bar were a bit older than we were. It seems that Bar Louie is trying too hard to be trendy with the decor/neon blue lighting/extensive martini list. Maybe I'm just salty about the wait.",

    "text": "Meh, I just don't see the appeal Bar Louis has to Pittsburghers. I guess this particular restaurant benefits from people who work at the Waterfront stopping in after a shift. It's always packed. Being so close to the AMC theater, they get traffic before and after movies.   It's expensive, the food is so so. Before I get ahead of myself, I had the BBQ ranch chicken salad without chicken. The BBQ ranch dressing was very good, but it's very easy to duplicate at home. It's equal parts ranch dressing and KC Masterpiece hickory BBQ sauce and a drop or two of Worcestershire and a drop of franks hot sauce.   Tuesday is dollar burgers 5 until midnight, daily drink and happy hour selections, but even that's not enough to get me here. Skip it. One caveat for this location, free parking. At Station Square's location you gotta pay to park the jalopy.  I'm eager to see if this place sees a huge drop in business when Burgatory opens across the street.",

    "text": "Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.  Remember when you'd go somewhere and have good food, great service and a general pleasant experience and then a few months you'd go back and have it all again? Well one day you decide to go back and you realized everything has changed in a way that you can't describe and the place is no longer familiar. To me, that is Bar Louie  I can't say the food is bad. I had an order of the pretzel sticks for an appetizer and the cinnamon sauce tasted like water and the pretzels were stale. I will say I still ate them so shame on me. My  sandwich (the Mario) as always was very good.  Now here comes the bad:  1. There were fruit flies EVERYWHERE. I felt like we were eating on top of a garbage dump. At one point I had to get a new drink because one flew in my beer. I understand that the establishment is an indoor/outdoor place but there is no reason for 15 fruit flies to hover over my table.  2. The place is enormous and they had one, very nice, but over worked server. The girl looked like she was about to have a heart attack because she never stopped moving.  3. Because of number two our service in general was not good. I can't totally blame the girl she did the best we could. I mean. I've played Diner Dash on my iPad, I know what happens when a place fills up too quickly when you are the only one working.  It's sad when a place you love turns into a place you never want to go again. I think I'm being very generous by giving it two stars but because I used to love it so much I can't rate it that low. Part of me hopes it gets better, but like an absentee father it'll just let me down again.",

They're normal corporate restaurant drinks...i.e., Applebees.  Service is hit or miss. Last time I went, I had just fine service. The time before that was also just fine. Sometimes the server is a little spazzy and seems new or doesn't know wtf he's talking about. (Once, I went and ordered red zinfandel and he brought me white zinfandel and argued with me that it was red zinfandel. I had to explain to him that white zinfandel can be confusing because it is, in fact, pink. I still don't think he believed me. It would've been amusing if it weren't for the fact that it was actually annoying).   Things I like: calamari, pretzel sticks, wedge salad, some of the sandwiches. Things I dislike: frozen burgers they sell for $1.  Great to stop in right before a movie at Loews, though! :-)",

    "text": "Staff need customer service training and polish. Four of us went to join a friend's group and sat at a recently-vacated table next to the table reserved by that group because the reserved table was full.  When the server came to clear the table, instead of asking if we had been helped or could she get us anything (Waiting Greeting 101 in a seat-yourself situation), she asked \"Are you going to order anything or are you...just...sitting?\"  This implication of our being in an establishment that we are not patronizing was, well, patronizing.  We ordered.  My mixed drink was tasty and not too weak or too strong. Others at my table waited 15+ minutes for a bottle of beer, got the wrong drink ingredient once -- the server laughed off her mistake, which was the only time she expressed anything other than disdainful grumpiness -- and were asked if they would be ordering more drinks when they asked to pay for their current order.  She didn't want to ring up the order if more orders were coming. That was not unreasonable to ask, but the way it was asked was again condescending and dismissive.  A few times food we didn't order was held over our table (eye level less than a foot from our faces), and when we said it was not for our table, the person was confused and it took four or five statements of \"that is not for our table...you have the wrong table...not our food, buddy...\" to get them to take the food elsewhere.  So the systems can use some improvement.  I may have ordered food, which in the past was flavorful enough there, but as you can tell I was already unhappy with the lack of professionalism and so I declined. Our table left much earlier and spent much less than we would have if the staff were welcoming.",

We realized that seating our group may be a challenge. We offered to split into several tables to make things easier. We sat at 3 tables in the patio area. The entire place was not very crowded for a Saturday night at 10 p.m. We expected great service and planned on ordering a few rounds of drinks for our celebration.   We waited about 15 minutes before a waitress acknowledged our table. We told her we were only ordering cocktails and no food. She took our orders while looking fairly disgusted. We waited patiently enjoying the outdoor seating. 30 minutes passed. 45 minutes passed. An hour passed. Finally, I went to the bar to see if there was a problem or if they lost our order. Our waitress had not come back to our table during our wait. The bartender said they were almost ready. The waitress arrived with our drinks a few minutes later and rolled her eyes on multiple occasions as she placed the drinks in front of us. The waitress knocked into a woman's chair and failed to apologize and proceeded back inside the restaurant.   Our waitress was simply rude and had a bad attitude. She made a few other errors with drink orders and mistakes with our bills. We were patient and polite, but she didn't seem to care. We would have loved to stay for another drink, but we didn't have another hour to wait around for bad service.   All in all, we all felt that our experience was quite poor especially because we've been to other locations and had good times. I would hope that our experience was a rare one since the cocktails are delicious!",

They have a decent beer selection but when I asked what their seasonal Great Lakes on tap was they said the Christmas ale (it's the last week in April now). I knew that if I ordered that draft it would be quite stale as it's probably been in there for 6 months now, so I got a Southern Tier instead which was good.  The service is ok but rather slow.

We are told to sit wherever, so we did. We placed an order for a martini, a triple dipper appetizer, two orders of boneless wings and two flat bread pizzas at 645/650. Our drinks arrive nearly 20 minutes later, along with the chips and dip. The cheese was getting solid on top from sitting, the sofa I had also ordered was flat, both time I sent it back. At the 35 minute waiting mark from ordering we decided we were done waiting and asked for a manager. I told them everything above, and we would be leaving. The \"reason\" was they were training new personnel. As a consumer, it is not my place to deal with training during happy hours, this is a management issue. As a patron, with a low expectation I didn't think my experience could get lower than before . I will most likely not return.",

The restaurant is pricey for what it is, and our waitress was a bit lackluster.  So why does Bar Louie get 3 stars? Happy Hour and a nice patio!  Happy Hour is on Monday-Friday from 4-7pm and offers lots of different options -- $3 Drafts, $4 Wines, $5 Martinis, and 1/2 Price Select Appetizers and Flatbreads. My friend and I ordered 4 Martinis and 3 Appetizers between the 2 of us, and our bill was less than $40 total. Not bad!  I ordered a Strawberry Peach Bellini and a S'Mores Martini, and both were tasty. We shared Bruschetta Pomodoro, Spinach & Artichoke Dip, and Roasted Vegetable Flatbread. The food was also good, and I would order all three items again in the future.  My recommendation is to understand what Bar Louie is good at (Happy Hour) and only frequent the restaurant at those times!",

I went here with my boyfriend for a friend's birthday a few weeks back however, and I can say that this location (as opposed to the nasty one in Station Square) is pretty okay. The restaurant is spacious inside with plenty of potential to expand outdoors during the warmer months. We had excellent table service from a very nice server who did a good job keeping everyone's drinks full. It was dollar beer night, but all of the options on special were unfortunately not palatable if you like good beer. I would be much more inclined to come back for a beer night if BL rotated one (just one!) nice craft option in with the others. Plenty of people will still choose the piss of course, but ones like me would be so happy. The free chips and dip appetizer I ordered was great at least, particularly the guacamole. If I ever was in the area I would come back and get that again and possibly a drinkable beer during happy hour, since those prices looked good.",

    "text": "I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \"The Hangover\" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally, \"The Hangover\" is one of the funniest movies I've seen in years and worth the $10 to see it in the theater.  Okay, back to the restaurant the space itself is very nice.  There are plenty of hightops, plasmas and a few booths.  It's spacious and they have outdoor seating and open windows.  We sat at the bar and were greeted relatively quickly by the bartender who was tending a pretty much empty bar.  I ordered a guinness as usual, Rob ordered a long island iced tea and Matt had a miller light.  Make sure and tell them if you want a top shelf tea else you'll be getting the stuff in the plastic bottles.  I sampled Rob's long island tea and it was not that good way too much sours.  The next one he ordered was much better after a little guidance to the bartender.  The bartender herself was okay, not too friendly but quick enough with the pours.  I don't remember her name which is usually not a good sign.  We ordered a few things from the appetizer menu.  We started with the chips and salsa.  The chips were crisp enough, but not served warm and the salsa had some spice but the colors were a little off kind of looked like the color of pea soup.  Rob then ordered the philly cheese steak sliders.  I tried one it was okay I guess  the bun was warm and it was pretty loaded with cheese and onions.  He asked for a side of mayo and they said they were out, which is bizarre because there is a giant eagle a couple blocks away.  This pretty much sums up my experiences at the Bar Louie's I've been too.  They kind of do just enough for me to come back but rarely make any real effort with service.  Maybe I'm being too critical... I tried to order the baked goat cheese, but they were out... So, I settled on the hummus appetizer.  This was surprisingly pretty good.  The pita was warm and toasted the hummus had lots of flavor and the tabouleh was edible.  It's probably best to stick to simple stuff when dining here.  Matt had the hot wings which I tried one and it was okay, your pretty standard mass produced chicken wing.  All in all this place isn't that bad.  If you want to grab a drink before or after the movie and you're more concerned with convenience than necessarily friendly service and really good food than you could do worse.",

    "text": "Came here for happy hour and a bite to eat on a Friday evening.  They have some great happy hour deals - $3 drafts (with a nice selection) and half off flat bread pizza. I believe there are three or four different types of the flat bread to choose from.    My friend and I sat at the bar and I have to say the service was just ok.  We weren't given plates or silverware with our pizza, the servers didn't seem to know what the other was doing, and it was a bit haphazard.  I ordered a burger medium rare that came out so rare I could have milked the cow.  However, the tatertots served with it were delicious.  Located at the Waterfront across from the movie theater Bar Louie offers both indoor and outdoor seating and is a decent option if you don't want to wait around at the other restaurants (Burgatory is directly across from it!).    This will not be a go to destination for me but it is a decent happy hour choice.",

    "text": "Bar Louie is my go to place in the Waterfront.  Consistently good food and friendly talkative wait and bar staff. Lots of wonderful specials but nothing tops Tuesday, dollar burger night, a Bar Louie tradition.   Especially nice in the summertime when the garage doors come up, windows open and upper loft patio is full.  Flame pits are on the patio and provide warmth on a cool night. The food is an eclectic mix.  Burgers are great as are the tots, get them loaded or better yet down them for speed :). Mussels are good, salads are great!  Appetizers are all excellent.  Try the Bavarian pretzels with quest or the calamari!  My favorite, especially on a cold or rainy day is their chicken tortilla soup.  If you give a green light to the cook, he'll spice it up to en fuego,  the way it's meant to be eaten.  Endless refills of soft drinks allow you to sit and chat for as long as you like.  This is a wonderful spot to people watch on movie night or catch some of the Steelers who like to stop by. Love places that keep eating out fun.  This is a place where they remember your name!  Recommend strongly!!",

    "text": "I don't frequent Bar Louie, and I really don't plan to change that any time soon. I've eaten here and stopped in for drinks a couple times over the years and I just haven't been super impressed by the place.  The food has been decent - a few years back I splurged on an enormous fried chicken sandwich and definitely enjoyed it, glutton that I am - but their meals and appetizers alike have admittedly never \"wowed\" me. And while I enjoy their cocktails and would consider stopping in just for drinks more often, the problem is that things are way overpriced here. Even during the happy hour drinks are pretty costly, not to mention that I think most of the drinks I personally like don't qualify for the happy hour discount, which is disappointing. Once I stopped in with friends after a movie and one drink cost me $10 here. Not even a large one, either! Sorry, but I find that to be kind of ridiculous, especially since there's cheaper places to get drinks in the area.  Still, the food and drinks are definitely a-ok albeit overpriced, so this place would be rated 3 stars in my mind IF I could hear myself think when I eat here. But good Lord, they're just so loud! I always leave with a sore throat from yelling to make myself heard. Not cool, Bar Louie. Not cool.  So while the food and drinks are fine enough the loud venue and prices mean that this is definitely not one of my favorite places - and given the other options we have at the Waterfront I don't expect to be back in any time soon.",

The sign said seat yourself and on 1st pass the only tables available were hightops built more fir standing with your adult beverages. This wasn't on this gals preferred list. We attempted the joint next door but waiting 90 min was an even I don't think so.... Back at  Bar Louie we went and scored a recently vacated table.  Maria our awesome waitress greeted us kindly but have us some bad news... They were training new kitchen staff and it was taking a bit longer than usual for orders to come out.. But she assured us once they did they were as yummy and up to Bar Louie standards people have come to expect.  Okay... Kudos, for letting us know in advance.  We ordered drinks and the food came out quicker than expected.  I ordered the  Chop Chop salad and added shrimp to mine... Was done perfectly and the slice of garlic toast was a welcome addition.  My husband  opted for the savory Mac n cheese pork sandwich....my taste bite was scrumptious and lived up to maria's hype.  Great food... Superb service... Great to see a chat in restaurant can still offer patrons something to come back for!",

    "text": "This is one of those places where the presentation is nice, but the taste is too ordinary. Friends and I went here for happy hour (starting at 5pm). They claimed to have $1 draft, $5 mixed drinks, and half off appetizers. When we got there, we realized the happy hour special only applies to certain items, so pretty much the discount was pointless. We ended up spending a fortune on beer and mediocre appetizers.   I only had appetizers here so I can't really judge them for their entrees, but I will rate according to my eating/drinking experience.  I got the spinach artichoke dip. It was a little runny and the dip to chips ratio was disappointing. For a dip, it had way too many obstacles built in to it. I don't know what they did with the artichoke, but it was super fibrous...I felt like I was chewing grass.   Overall, I would not recommend this place unless you have money to make it rain. Food was way too average for the high price.",

She was attentive and on her game. I had the 'Diva' martini, which was very sweet and fruity. The bruschetta was good as well (however not traditional), served with a mix of tomato, onion, lettuce. The soft  pretzel sticks were your typical pretzel stick, however good, and served with three dipping sauces, honey mustard, a cheese dip, and a brown sugar/butter dip. The chips and salsa were served with three salsas, guac, regular salsa with a kick, and the cheese dip. The bar is clean. The food is trustworthy and not half bad, it is noisy, but that's is to be expected. It is a great place to watch a game, hang with friends and let go of work. The location is prime as well. Overall, a very pleasant surprise.",

I'd suggest ordering that if you come here for a bite to eat. I also tried their Pinot Grigio, but it was in a very dirty glass.  Service was ok as well. It wasn't really busy, but it was steady. When we walked in no one was around the door and there were dirty tables everywhere. So we made our way towards the back and sat down at the only clean table. It seems like the waitresses won't clean the tables until after new customers sit down. After a few minutes, I noticed a table of two that were beside us. They were there before us but they had yet to be taken care of even after we got our drinks and ordered. All in all, this place just needs a bit of organization.",

When we first arrived we were seated back in the corner next to the bar like we did something wrong and were being punished for it. After 10 minutes and no waitress coming to our table we made our way to the second floor loft area and waited for someone to get up so we could grab a couple seats.  Once we were able to get a seat we both started off with Mason/ Dixon cocktails which features sweet tea, SKYY Citrus, fresh brewed tea, pure cane syrup and fresh lemon and come served in a Mason Jar. This cocktail was delicious as we each had two, but both swear that there was no alcohol in them what so ever! We basically just had sweet teas with lemon.  For our food we had Bacon Cheeseburger Sliders which features Applewood smoked bacon, cheddar, pickles and is topped with fried onion strings. They were pretty good. The bacon on them was excellent though. We also had the Pot stickers which are pan-seared pork dumplings topped with Szechwan sauce. They were outstanding!  After we got our food our waitress went M.I.A. and we had to flag down another waiter to ask for water and our check as we would have been late for our movie had we waited a few minutes longer.  We usually don't frequent Bar Louie too often so hopefully this was an isolated event.",

It had a nice crunchy texture from the onion straws, a splash of tanginess from the BBQ sauce, and a nice smoky flavor from the burger and cheese. I also had the loaded tots which were amazing. On a Thursday night, it was less crowded than I had expected especially for $2.75 martinis.

    "text": "This review is aided by the happy hour martinis. I'd give those 5 stars- but they lose stars for average food and inside uncleanliness. For $5 (and change) the martinis are very good! I don't like the taste of alcohol and these are very flavorful- mask it well. Smores (pictured) and Honeydew are my favorites. Drafts are $3. Makes for a nice date night happy hour before a movie. Not sure I'd come here when it's full price, though.   The food here is pretty average- good selection but flavor is nothing spectacular. For the purposes of happy hour, though, it's good. Husband had pork tacos and I had buffalo chicken flatbread.   Service was fine. Seat yourself. Last time I was here we sat outside because the inside floor was really sticky. Server came over quickly and got us waters right away, refilled without needing asked. If I had to sit inside, though, I probably would've left. Seriously, the floor was nasty. At 5:30pm? Inexcusable. Sorry. I've been here on a Tuesday for cheap burger day and don't remember it being so sticky, so maybe it was just a bad day.   Bottom line, sit outside for happy hour. Or pass.",

The one thing different is the option for tater tots which people seem to enjoy. Service is fine and prices average. My most favorite thing from Bar Louie is without a doubt, the Berry Mojito! I want one now they are so good! Made with fresh berries and mint! I must get one every time! You will not be disappointed if you like mojitos! I think they are $10 which some might think is expensive but they are just so good! Good wise, I still haven't had anything I really like and I'd rather just come here for drinks.",

Been there twice now for both of before-mentioned occasions and both times had their appetizers.  Note that if you can catch them during their happy hour from 5 to 7pm on weeknights, your pocket book will thank you.  The two of us diners selected three appetizers to share the first visit and two on the second visit and were quite satisfied with presentation, quantity, and quality.  I would highly recommend the Bruschetta Pomodoro and the calamari (breaded just right and not overdone).",

It's a super casual spot in a nice location. Rather it's after shopping or after work Bar Louie has a decent crowd. Sometimes it gets super crowded if there's a game or if it's a nice day and it's fine. The service here depends on how busy it is. Sometimes it's been quick and sometimes you're all \"Where's my drink?\"  I enjoy their cocktails and the fact that they have a different special for every day of the week. But please don't get fooled. These specials seem cheap until you realize their burger special makes you pay for every topping and their bottomless mimosas aren't really bottomless. After you get over the real price of the specials and you get your yummy dessert flavored beverage everything is okay.",

We are typically here with the Sunday lunch crowds, so I don't know how busy this place can get.   We choose to sit at the bar. I think it's 'seat yourself' but we've always sat at the bar so honestly, I'm not sure. They have a really good beer selection, and the Sunday bartender is super awesome about letting us sample any of the newer beers if we'd like.   I love getting their pretzels. They've since changed the menu, and the pretzels used to come with a cinnamon butter. I found out the hard way that they no longer do.. boo :( Not sure I'll keep getting them, because I'm not a fan of the other dips (cheese and mustard).   I love their salmon sliders. The pesto sauce on them pairs really well and it's just super flavorful and delicious.   The bill at the end tends to be a bit more on the expensive side. For essentially the same food you can get at the TGI Friday's across the street, this is a little more expensive. However, we're usually very satisfied with our meals after the trip so we'll continue to come back for lunch",

    "text": "When a friend invited me to join her group for $5 burger night at Bar Louie, being a vegetarian I checked out the website and was pleased to see they offered the vegan Impossible Burger. I called to see if it was included at the $5 price and was told \"yes.\" It was my first time going and I was curious about the place.  However when I gave my order to the server, she informed me that the Impossible Burger would be $8. I told her I had called about the price beforehand and, when she reiterated, I asked to talk with the manager.  Missy, the manager, was rather condescending and not at all apologetic about the miscommunication.  Her repeated reply was \"if I gave it to you at that price, I'd have to give it to everyone at that price.\" I then asked her if she would at least comp me my one beer and she declined that small bit of customer service as well. In fact, Missy's entire interaction with me was with a huge grin on her face despite my obvious annoyance at the misquoted price - completely and totally inappropriate under the circumstances.  When I asked the server for a phone number to make a complaint, I was given the corporate office number - in Texas - which I called the next day and spoke with absolutely no one. No human answers their phones at all.  My next call was to the Bar Louie on the North Side. I explained what had happened at the Waterfront location, was asked for contact information - which I gave, and told the manager would call me when he came in. She also apologized and said that she didn't agree with how Missy handled the situation. Five days later, nothing.  So I called again this evening and was connected to the bar manager. He claimed he texted the manager and would call me once he got a response.  Yeah - nothing again.  If you're looking for customer service, don't go to Bar Louie - at all. I can't speak for the food and the drinks selection was pretty sparse.  Find a nice locally owned brewpub instead - one that actually wants your business and will treat you that way. Pub in the Park in Swissvale is pretty good - and they have the Impossible Burger too with a far superior beer selection.",

After a quick check online we decided to Bar Louie was the place to go. The service was fast and friendly. And I really appreciated the fact that when we told our waitress that we had a movie to go to she put a little bit of a rush on our order. She made sure that we got out on time and that I'm grateful for. I hate sometimes when you go to a restaurant and you say I have to be out or do you think that this will be done in a certain time and they say yes and it's not at all the case. So this type of service really puts me in a great mood.  We ordered the special of a glass of wine because they were I believe for $4.50 each, which you really cannot beat. I went with a Moscato and it was great. My friend with the Cab and it was also pretty good too.  We order the Thai chicken flatbread and an order of boneless wings. They both came out fairly quickly and were pretty tasty.  The Thai chicken flatbread had a pretty good sauce over it and I would say it would be a solid three and a half. I think that it would be overwhelming to eat an entire flatbread with that flavor combination but between the two of us it was pretty good.  The boneless wings were pretty standard. Deep-fried and crunchy. They had a lot of sauce on them which I liked and enough vegetables to share between the two of us. I would probably order this again.  If you're looking for some good specials and Quick Service before a movie I would suggest coming to Bar Louie. Sit at the bar and tell them your movie time. They for sure they will get you out in time for your movie, and with your belly full.",

With almost every drink under $8 and about 10 menu items ranging from $4-$8, there's something for everyone. I ordered the calamari that was refreshingly fresh and I don't think I'd had better tomato sauce. My cheese quesadilla could feed two and rang in at a thrifty $4.

I went to your restaurant two days ago, I got the pretzel sticks. I was feeling pretty good all day up until they have fully digested in my stomach. I immediately ran to the bathroom. It was delicious on the taste buds, but not so delicious for whoever went into the stall after me. There was water coming out of where my bunghole should have been. I tried to empty my bowels in the restroom. Just when I thought I was okay, I left the facility. I was driving home when the urge hit me. I soiled my pants. I soiled my pants in my car from eating at your restaurant. I feel like you don't use actual bread dough, but instead you use a bread dough mixed with laxatives. My bunghole felt like the ring of fire.  A total 1.5 out of 10.",

We were seated right away but waited for over 15 min with no one even asking if we wanting even a glass of water. As we waited, a group of 4 sat down near us in our section and got served right away. Still the waitress gave the gentleman a sample of two beers but no one come over to us. There were staff on their phones and hanging out. Not the way to treat your customers. After seeing this, we left and went to yokoso. So glad we did because the service was what you'd expected, GREAT.",

I love trying them at various establishments and I can say the ones at Bar Louie were better than expected. They came out in a huge platter, fajita style. The fish was a bit too salty for my taste, but otherwise cooked well. The accompaniments made for the perfect taco, especially the corn tortillas. They were very flavorful.   My friend ordered the lettuce wraps and enjoyed them as well. The presentation on both dishes was great.",

Besides that there are many better choices, no hostess so we sat at a high top by the bar, once a waitress final came over we got our drink order in and ordered boneless wings and loaded tots ( no green onions & not jalapenos.) both well done.  Drinks came out quick and the food right after, fast service for sure except it must have been for someone else, the tots were loaded with onions ( although not green) & the wings had green onions all over them (you'd think if you say no green onions on one and the other comes with it you'd mention it , guess not. Neither item was hot and neither was well done, I mentioned it to the waitress, she did say sorry but made no attempt to fix the order.   Makes you wonder why at 8:30 on a Sat they were half empty....I guess now I know.  Seriously get it together.  I gave 2 stars instead of one because it's still seems like a cool place to grab a beer, but eat before hand for sure.",

Then, on Tuesday's, they have $1 build your own burgers! You can choose beef, chicken or turkey to build your sandwich! I chose chicken and a few extra toppings to put on it. The BBQ ranch is really delicious! My meal was under $10 and it was a good meal! I'd definitely go back for happy hour!",

When she finally did make her way to our end she greeted the people who just sat down and ignored us who had been sitting there for 7 minutes. This was NOT a busy time and therefore has no excuse for us having to wait more than 2 minutes for a drink. We got up and walked out and will never be back.

We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up, but I would say that the bar was not even 3/4 full.  There were also plenty of empty tables.  This should have been our sign to run in the opposite direction.  But we grabbed a table.  I am not a clock watcher, so I am not sure how long it took us to get a server but it was at least 5-7 minutes.  Then we got our drinks at 7:04.  The only reason that I know is because I was looking at my phone because my husband and I wanted to get some apps ordered before the end of Happy Hour.  That went out the window.  When our friends for there; they ordered drinks.  We finished them and left.  The server was nice, that is not the issue.  The issue was how GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED they were.  They had two bartenders on (I think) and not nearly enough cocktail servers.  The server apologized for the wait on the drinks, but explained it away with \"this happens at the end of happy hour because the bar get swamped\".  That is a sign that you need more staff.  I have never had this happen at any other bar before.  Get more staff.  We ended up passing up on food because we were worried about time, not the fact that we did not get HH pricing.  Even though, in my opinion, they should have honored HH pricing since we were ready to order food at 7:50/7:55.  We ended up going to the Improv and got food there.  Bar Louie lost a great deal of my money because their lack of staffing and they will never get our Pittsburgh business again or our friends who live there.",

The menu is large and reminds me of epcot with all the different ethnicities represented.   gordan Ramsey would probably comment on the lack of focus at first sight.   Miller Lites are $4 a pop which was a big downer as i got my $85 bill for two apps and multiple miller lites.    Great atmosphere and probably a fine place to watch the pens game.

However, we were bothered that none of the special martinis actually resembled a real martini. No gin or vermouth was used, it's mostly purees and champagne floats with flavored vodkas.  Anyway, the small plates made for good \"upscale\" bar food. Half-price apps make for a cheap, but nice, dinner and a movie - great, great specials. However, I would not buy a full-priced dinner here. Nothing aside from the apps grabbed me for the outstanding price. The baked goat cheese was small but delicious, and the tempura fried shrimp was just right but the sauces didn't match up exactly.  Be warned that the seats make you feel like you're going to be swallowed by them. Seriously, the booth was like sitting in the mouth of a whale.",

Can be loud--not a place for a romantic date... The bathroom condition was really bad.  The server did comp up an appetizer, and they were friendly enough.. they just failed to wow.

Unfortunately, I cannot because the service was so bad that I left before I had the chance to order. We found seats at the bar behind the taps. After sitting there for 5 minutes and not being acknowledged, we thought that they might not be able to see us, and so we moved to a different pair of seats in the middle of the bar, grabbing a few menus on the way so we would be ready to order. It was fairly busy, but it is not like there were people standing at the bar trying to get drinks - everyone was seated and I'm sure they face much busier times. We sat in our new seats for almost 15 minutes (I timed it - I am not exaggerating), and were not even acknowledged. You would at least think the bartender would acknowledge us and tell us he would be with us when he could, but despite staring him down almost the whole time, we could not even make eye contact.

Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks, and it took them 15 minutes to come...no, not alcoholic drinks, two waters and an iced tea. This should have been a bad sign, but at this point we ordered food.  20 minutes go by...we flag down our waitress, to let her know that we need to get to a movie in 45 minutes. She said our food would be out in a few minutes. Another 20 minutes, still no food, and our waitress is nowhere to be seen. We flag down another waitress, she says she will find our waitress, who we then notice is chatting with one of the other waitresses. She finishes her conversation and finally makes her way over to our table about five minutes later. She says she didn't even realize our food hadn't arrived (well, you never even checked on us, so of course you didn't). After speaking with the kitchen staff, she informs us that she \"definitely\" put our order in so it \"must have been given to someone else by mistake.\" Because they wouldn't have noticed that that WASN'T what they ordered? Seriously?  The waitress told us she could give us our food for take out and, since we were starving, we reluctantly agreed. 10 minutes later, our food and the bill arrived. All that was comped was the iced tea, and we got some free utensils and wetnaps. How generous! We shovelled what we could into our mouths, did NOT leave a tip (thankfully, we didn't have the added gratuity that John had), and sprinted to our movie where we covertly finished our smuggled food. Worst part? I opened the wetnap, and it was totally dry. Of course.  However, I gave this place two stars instead of one. That's because my food, when I finally got it, was perfect. I had the Greek burger and it was huge, cooked exactly how I like it, with delicious toppings. I really wish I could come back here for the food but...hell no.",

    "text": "My friends and I went down to the waterfront to enjoy some shopping and have dinner. Everywhere was pretty busy so when we went into Bar Louie we were not upset it took at least ten minutes for a server to come to our table. He immediately brought our waters over and we ordered drinks. Only another 30 minutes until he brought ONE martini over. We ordered our food and after talking to management it still took 45 minutes and our order was messed up. We tried to be understanding when we learned it was only our servers first day but you would think that management would try to help the poor guy out! He didn't get out of the weeds for the 2 hours we were there. Very disappointing and embarrassing on managements part. We weren't the only people having horrible service because when we looked around the bar everyone was upset. I hope they will let the server get some more experience rather than feeding him to the wolves on the second day.",

    "text": "Visited on a Thursday night for a date, and it was pretty slow. I ordered a Havana Mojito - this drink was featured on their menu, and it was horrible. It tasted like pure lime juice with a little sugar water thrown in - no taste of alcohol whatsoever. Later in the evening, when the bill came, I discovered that I was charged $10 for it. I have never before been charged $10 for a mixed drink - that is highway robbery. For dinner I had the \"Drunken Fish & Chips\" - another complete waste of money. Three little strips of fish, along with a handful of fries. The cost of this was $13. It tasted okay, but certainly not $13 worth of food. The food arrived fairly quick, but the waitress seemed rather aloof - like she could care less about waiting on customers. The atmosphere was nice, and the food was okay (but skimpy on portion size). However, the prices were astronomical and the service was ho-hum at best.",

We got to Bar Louie a little over 2 hours before the movie started, which left us with hardly any time to spare by the time we were done.  We had a table right away and the server took drink orders, but it took 15 minutes to get our drinks.  She then disappeared for 30 minutes before coming back to take a food order.  The food took almost an hour, and we had only ordered a couple appetizers.  The portions were really small for the price, and most of the food came out burnt.  I did not risk mentioning it at the thought of waiting another hour for new food.  Again, waiting for the server to bring the checks after the meal was an ordeal in itself and took much longer than it should have.    The place was busy, but not overcrowded, what I would expect on a typical weeknight.  There is no excuse for the poor service and food.  On top of that, the restrooms were extremely filthy and clearly had not been stocked or cleaned recently.  Maybe it was just an off night for this place, but I do not plan on going back again and taking that chance.",

All around great day until we hit Bar Louie for some drinks and appetizers.  I am giving it one star, though it deserves none, because our waitress was nice, if a bit inattentive, and the hummus app we ordered was pretty damn good. Outside of that Bar Louie leaves a lot to be desired.  This is probably the first place I've been to where they charge $10 and up for all mixed drinks. To me, that is beyond ridiculous. Bar Louie is not an upscale restaurant, as much as they wish they were, and paying almost $60 for three drinks and two appetizers is insanity defined.   As I mentioned the waitress was friendly, but she definitely did not come back and check on us enough. I really wanted to like this place because of things I had heard and the drinks we had were really damn good, but if it want to spend that kind of money, I'll go somewhere that I can get good service.",

I received better service at McDonald's. The bar had a total of five people at it yet it was dirty the whole bar and I had to wait ten minutes for her to pick up the prior quests receipts so I could sit down.  Upon sitting told was not even nicely greeted was told \"you have to wait awhile\" I have been in the restaurant business for years and was never treated so poorly. After politely ordering a total of 4 easy drinks to make ( one being a double shot) the tab was 63 in a period of ten minutes.  Around 930 the bartender did not even ask if I wanted another drink or even food at that matter.  Just slapped the tab on the table.  ( now mind you I just got done running a restaurant all night). So I figured just pay.  Even after leaving 11.00 tip I was not even thanked.  The bar tender could have easily sold 2 dinners another two round of drinks making the tab close to 170-180 in a period of twenty minutes.  I will not return.  So just of my business and the many people I refer places your company at minimum had lost 85 grand in one year but such crummy service to one person. We all have bad days. I have had days where I have had deaths in my family and never treated guests so poorly.    Coming from someone in the business, it was horrible experience. Seemed like the regulars were treated better than the new guests.  Not a way to create business.   On a Sunday night it is slow enough, let alone driving away guests.   It was overall a terrible experience.  On further note after many attempts I was never contacted by anyone about this, so I will tell my 400 guests I meet daily to eat elsewhere at the waterfront.",

They've got nice outdoor seating with great fire ornaments, but, well, it is outdoors.  In the past, service was really bad. I quit going for a while, after having to \"Do the wave' for a check.

Courtney was great - super attentive, brought our drinks out in less than 5 minutes, brought our food quickly, checked on us just enough... And the place was packed. The drinks were perfect, just strong enough. We tried the Peach Lighting and the Tiki drink. I liked the tiki thing better but that's just personal choice.
