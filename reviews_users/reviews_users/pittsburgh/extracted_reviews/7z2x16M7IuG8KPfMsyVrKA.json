My husband and I have eaten here twice, both times have been amazing. We spent our honeymoon in Spain and visited San Sebastian, the home of Spanish pintxos. This restaurant always reminds me of that amazing trip. The food is well executed and delicious. The last time we went we stopped in on a whim expecting to either not get seated or maybe wait for a bar seat. The staff was so accommodating, they were able to fit us in the dinning room by chance. Service is superb. Highly recommend the pickled cauliflower, amazing dish.",

They are delivered quickly, so dinner is easily done in 1-1.5 hours. The cocktail and wine selection is small, but those that are offered are very good. Two observations worth mentioning are that there very few seafood items on the menu and they need to improve the air conditioning.",

It had a lovely floral taste and was not very sweet, but it was delicious, refreshing, and garnished beautifully! Because I have always wanted to tracks to Spain to eat authentic Spanish ham, I ordered both the Jamon iberico and the Surryanyo Ham. The iberico is pricy, but WELL WORTH THE MONEY!! I have never tasted anything like it! if you LOVE ham, then I say GET THAT HAM!!!   I also ordered the chorizo, leek, and potato stew, and shared the blistered leek and romanesco dish. Everything was spectacular! My husband (a vegetarian who understands my love of cured meats) ordered a couple of fried croquettes that he said were delicious. I am not sure what they were because I was too enamored with my ham to pay attention to anything else.  The service is great and the atmosphere is comfortable but still has that fine I dining feel. I really like it when I can go and have a good meal but feel comfortable as well.   In closing I would like to leave you with this advice about this wonderful restaurant: GET THAT HAM!",

It may have been the best small plate dinner we've had in a while... we ordered the oysters. They came with a fantastic ramp mignonette to compliment the buttery, slippery oyster. Superb. The next dish was tuna crudo with fresh peaches and salty crunchy mushrooms, with a sprinkling of some sprout like green herb and a chile oil.... so good. You should order it. The tuna was fresh and buttery, peaches were tart and sweet. We tried the octopus based on a review on yelp that mentioned how tender the octopus was. I tried octopus a few other places and was totally let down :::cough,cough, Tako:::::it's always been so rubbery and flavorless. This 'pus came with yogurt, dill, cucumber, nuts and was probably favorite of the evening. The last dish was the pork belly with peaches and some type of fruit compote. It was crispy, fresh, and amazing. We got the guell something and the menasco? Sour? The sour tasted like wine on the top, sour on the bottom. The guell tasted like a Spanish twist on Italian spritz... like soda water with some bitters and wine. Everything was great, can't wait to go back!!!!",

The restaurant does get extremely loud, service was fantastic -the food was good to very good. Tried the ox tail-like a short rib French onion soup sandwich(best Dish i had). The beef tartar was an extremely fresh and light take on the dish which was really nice. The chorizo was fantastic and the ribs were fall off the bone and not to filling. I would give this a 4.5 if I could but I think the restaurant lacks a signature dish and if I would say cure is a 5 it's tough to give their sister restaurant the same rating but it is close.",

    "text": "Expectations influence experience. Fair or unfair it is True.  When you watch an Oscar nominated film you expect better than when you watch a Razzie.  Your filter changes.  So when you eagerly visit a restaurant of one of your favorite cuisines by a chef from one of your favorite restaurants (Cure) with the buzz of being the hottest opening in a foodie town your expectations are high.  Atmosphere:  The restaurant is beautiful.  Woodwork throughout represents incredible craftsmanship and looks very authentic to a typical upscale Spanish Tapas restaurant.  The Jamon hangs from the ceiling above a traditional tapas counter top display that makes you feel like you are on the Iberian peninsula.  Where this goes wrong is the playlist.  Perhaps i am being too literal but while a glass of chianti or scotch with Frank Sinatra is a great night on most occasions this is not what I look for with Spanish inspiration.  Flamenco, spanish guitar or other traditional music would better fit the bill.  Service: Very good, prompt, knowledgeable and attentive  Drinks: Cocktails were very nice - specifically the Gin and Tonics.  The red sangria was better than the white.  Food:  The important stuff.  Again to me Spanish cuisine is borderline perfection.  Tradition and ingredients trump creativity.  We can run through the Great, good and meh but overall if you live by the belief that octopus, chorizo and croquetas are some of the best things on earth you will be disappointed with the overuse/abuse of aioli and the lack of traditionalism.    Highlights:  Bacalao en Aceite, Matrimonio, Pimientos de Padrones (no need for the aioli), Jamon croqueta  Underwhelming dishes: Pulpo - admittedly this is a sacred dish for me and it was overpowered by sauce vs. standing on the flavor of the octopus Beef Tartare Montadito - nothing special Abuse of Aioli!!! I like Aioli its delicious but no need to include in every dish.  Tapas should stand on the flavor and quality of the lead item and not the sauce.  Additionally, Tapas mean you are eating many and the reliance on this one ingredient lead to a blend of flavors.  We went hoping for a 5. We ended at a 3.  We will be back but expected more and hope Morcilla can find its way to living up to the hype.",

As I was alone, I grabbed a seat at the bar thinking I'd just get a quick drink and dessert then head back to my AirBnB. I ended up hanging out for about 3 hours. People at the bar were super friendly and I got to watch the waitstaff slice charcuterie - which looked amazing. Also, one of the awesome bartenders, upon finding out I was new to town, gave me a list of food suggestions and fun things to do while in Pittsburgh. Cocktails were interesting and their sangria was perfect for an unusually hot spring day. For dessert, I ordered the churros which came with a chocolate hazlenut sauce - YUMMMMMMM. Will have to get a full meal at Morcilla on my next Pittsburgh trip!",

Even though most of the tapas are just a few bites, they're extremely diverse and intensely flavorful.  It's worth going with friends, and trying and sharing nibbles of everything.  The staff was attentive, courteous, and very knowledgeable about the menu, happy to discuss the differences between exotic dishes.  Quality ranged from extremely good all the way up to Transcendent with a capital T.  The following were some of the tastiest dishes we'd ever eaten.  The freshness, textures, and symphonic flavor compositions were perfection given physical form.    Beef Tartare  Foie Gras  Smoked Pork Conserva  Lamb en Moreno  My parents recently ate their way through Spain, and said Morcilla's spanish tapas cuisine was better than anything they had in Spain!  When you first walk in, you see the pigs hanging from the ceiling of the butcher bar, a fitting metaphor for the angelic flavors that could only come from pigs that fly.",

Different and definitely worth the taste especially since they have a special tap.  Once seated we looked at the menu and had trouble deciding which things to try.  Our waiter was well versed in the menu and initially guided us towards some safer menu items.  After discussions and initial orders, he helped us pick some more interesting choices.  My boyfriend and I tried 8 items on the menu.  Our favorites were the Morcilla Sausage, Oxtail and Octopus dishes.    Service was great and seems to be team oriented.

    "text": "I had a fantastic experience at Morcilla. I met a couple of friends for dinner here on Friday night, as I was moving out of Pittsburgh the next day and wanted to eat somewhere special for my last meal in the 'burgh. Given all of the great things I had been hearing about Morcilla, I made a reservation--and it did not disappoint!  The menu is broken down into a few categories depending on the type and size of the dish. Some items consist of just a few bites, then there are some larger plates, and even a few platters meant to be shared by the table. My friends and I took the approach of ordering a bunch of items and sharing/tasting them all. We were a little unsure of how much to order, but our waitress was very helpful and knowledgeable.  A few favorites were the beef tartare (on crusty, thin bread with cured egg yolk and vegetable escabeche--basically pickled veggies), the salt cod with crispy capers, fried garlic chips, and lemon, and also the lamb meatballs with with raisins, sumac, and leek. The tartare was possibly the best I've ever had, and was absolutely packed with flavor. The lamb meatballs were juicy and also full of flavor, and the sumac yogurt was a fantastic pairing. I also enjoyed the chorizo with crispy potato and brandied prune. The thick prune sauce was unique and a flavor combination that really stood out to me. While some items definitely stood out, everything was enjoyable and I loved the ability to experience so many different ingredients, textures, and flavors in one meal.  The service was also great. Dishes were brought out with timing in mind, so at no point were there more than two or three items on the table. Each dish was also explained as it arrived, which was also helpful since it's easy to forget exactly what was ordered when it comes to small plates.  It's also reasonably priced, especially given the quality--for ten menu items and three cocktails, our total bill (for three people) came to just under $100. Overall I really enjoyed this meal and would love to return whenever I'm in Pittsburgh visiting.",

Our server was attentive, prompt and conscientious. At her recommendation, I tried the Spanish Martini which was really good - not overpowering whatsoever. My wife had the sangria which was also good,  tasting subtly of star anise if you're into that.  As for the meal itself, we enjoyed all of our selections thoroughly and had no complaints. We tried the blood sausage and oxtail (montaditos), the goat cheese croquettes, duck leg (plate) and the rib platter. While small, the duck was cooked perfectly and fell right off the bone. The ribs were meaty, crispy on the outside and tender and flavorful on the inside. By the end of dinner we were both comfortably full.  To avoid a potential complaint of waiting a long time between courses, I'd suggest knowing what you would like to try ahead of time and ordering it all at once as opposed ordering a couple items at a time. We picked out our courses the night before, ordered them at the beginning and the pace of our meal was just right. Also, to avoid the potential pitfall of small-plate post-meal hunger, picking a platter and 4 other items was just right for 2 people.j",

There were of course some good ones though. It was a 50/50 toss up of good/needs work. But for the price, we were hoping for a higher winning percentage. We will come back in a few months after things are a bit more solid.  Good: BACALAO EN ACEITE; my husband ate a lot of this growing up with Mediterranean food. He thought this was done well. CHORIZO; excelente. OXTAIL; rich and tasty. PULPO; the octopus was cook perfectly. Not a pencil eraser rubber. PATO ESCABECHE; this was a smoky flavored duck that resembled pork (although I would have rather had the duck flavor not be overpowered by the smoke). The fruit it was paired with was marvelous.   Not my style....could be yours: CRAB BUTTER AND TARRAGON CHURRO; definitely for sharing with more than 2 people. Too rich by itself. 2-3 bites and everyone couldn't do anymore. PIGS FEET AND CHEEKS; 1 from my table liked it, I was indifferent. Wasn't bad, but didn't wow me. Was like an egg roll. LAMB EN MORENO; a bit gristley.  Missed the mark for everyone: SPIDER CRAB DEVILED EGG; I love deviled eggs. They are meant to be a vehicle of flavor. These were surprisingly bland. QUESO DE CABRA; something about the overly smokey cheese & spiced quince that combined to have a plastic flavor. This was the whole tables least favorite item.",

Service was friendly. But even for tapas - the serving sizes on the larger plates was tiny. $52 for 6 or 7 ounces of chicken and a couple of cups of rice? We spent at least $30 a person on food and were still very hungry - at which point we decided to cut our losses and head elsewhere for dessert and a night cap.",

The food was either very good (champinones a la plancha, Greek salad) or completely meh ( dry manchego biscuits, French press coffee, beet juice) or sounded better on the menu than it tasted like the lamb sausage. I wish Morcilla the best of luck, but on my next visit to Pittsburgh, I'll pass on coming here again.",

The ingredients were combined into an intoxicating fusion of flavor.  Everything we had was great, but I'd say the chorizo, the trout, and the ribs were our favorites.  Our waitress was super friendly and spent a good deal of time with us covering the menu and recommendations; she also gave us written recommendations of things to do in town.  They are gluten-conscious, and our waitress was very helpful in choosing GF menu items.     We happened to get a late seating on a Thursday night with a couple days notice, but I think weekends are booked out far in advance.  I so wish this restaurant was in my home town - it would be on our regular rotation.  We may have to travel to Pittsburgh again just to eat there!",

    "text": "For us first-time visitors to Pittsburgh, it didn't escape our notice that the city has received a bunch of national notices for its dining scene in the last few years.  The chef here, Justin Severino, gets mentioned in almost of those pieces.    We chose Morcilla for a big birthday dinner for one of us (I'll leave it at that!), and the restaurant came through with flying colors for that occasion.  Severino is most renowned as a magician of cured meats, based on his original restaurant down the avenue, Cure.  Not surprisingly, Morcilla's got an outstanding selection of charcuterie.  It'd be easy get lost in this first section of the menu and have no appetite left over for anything else.  (In fact, Morcilla offers \"All of the Meats\" for 50 bucks, and any big party should take advantage of that.  Hell, maybe just you and you and a single guest should make a trip just for that purpose.)  But we forced ourselves to make some tough cured-meat choices, and the namesake morcilla (basically a spicy pork salami) and Surryano Ham turned out to be great ones.  (That Surryano, which is a steal here for $7, comes from the excellent Edwards Smokehouse in Tidewater Virginia, which had a huge fire not ago and tragically lost tons of product.  Get it while you can.)    We also had the bacalao (codfish) en aceita, the \"Who Cooks for You\" salad (ground cherries, smoked goat cheese, candied pistachio, & peach-amontillado vinaigrette), and Spanish mackerel.  All terrific as well.  We wanted a little bit more, so we asked for the Cordero en Moreno (that was lamb meatballs in very North African yogurt sauce) and a half dozen oysters (out of Marblehead, Mass.).  More excellence.    The staff handled the birthday stuff with understated aplomb, and our main server did her job well all night.  Morcilla's got an attractive old-looking bar up front (even though the restaurant is almost brand new), and the back dining area has high vaulted ceilings and is comfortably and nicely appointed.  Only minor complaint with the whole experience is that the noise levels got kind of oppressive as the early evening became night.  All in all, easily one of the best two or three meals we've had all year.",

    "text": "My husband and I fell in love with this place at first sight!  We came to Morcilla after church on Sunday and arrived right as it opened, so it wasn't crowded at all.  We decided to eat at the bar because it looks welcoming and you get to watch the charcuterie preparations and cocktails.  Plus we like to talk to the bartender about his or her drink recommendations.  The Ambiance:  I am a sucker for a well thought out restaurant and bar, and this place was well thought out to me.  You can visibly see their pieces of meat aging right before your eyes, but it isn't creepy or anything.  I really like their material selection from the tiles or hardwood on the floors to the wood/tile selection on the walls.  I could imagine myself in a restaurant in Europe.  It is legit.  The drinks:  They have a nice drink selection.  I'm personally a HUGE gin fan, so when I heard they made their own tonic water I nearly jumped out of my seat to hug the bartender.  I appreciate fine taste!!!  I had the citadelle and it was floral goodness.  I also tried the botanist and it is my new favorite!!! Sweet and floral. My husband had a red sangria and it was probably the most potent sangria I've tasted.  It was REALLY good.  Apparently they have a red, white and rose sangria option.  The bartender recommended the red and rose.   The food:   There were so many food options that we were interested in, and we have to go back to try more!  Because the list was so overwhelming, we decided to first try the \"All the Meats\" charcuterie, and it was delicious!  We will be back!",

The cava sangria is delicious and not sweet with aromatic herbs and infused with fruit. The pickled beets were outstanding and complemented with flavorful goat cheese. The octopus was a total surprise. Not anything like I expected and so flavorful. The bacalao was fried which I hadn't had prepared this way before and surrounded by a tahini like sauce....amazing! The bistecca large place was the absolute best. Tender and served with roasted shallots and mashed potatoes.  I could go on and on but the food and drinks were beyond fantastic! Only wish the setting were alittle more comfortable and quiet!!",

I made many good decisions that night, but that was the best. Served somewhere between room temperature and body temperature, the ham melted in your mouth. Delicious! We went on to try the champignons a la plancha, the beef crudo, and the bacala croquetas. All absolute winners. The lamb tagine was also delicious with rhubarb, lebneh, pistachios and golden raisins. We finished with churros which were fine (nothing spectacular here). Will definitely be back next time I visit.",

    "text": "I blame my disappointment on myself, honestly.  I should have expected that an establishment like this would be severely overhyped, but I couldn't help but want to try Pittsburgh's own James Beard-nominated \"best new restaurant.\"  After waiting 4 weeks for a Saturday reservation at 5pm, we arrived at the restaurant 6 minutes before our reservation time to find the establishment closed to the public with a sign on the door.  A small crowd of hopeful diners gathered outside the door as the team within just stood there and watched us.  I understand that many restaurants do this--refuse to open their doors a minute before \"opening time\"--mostly just because they feel that they can get away with it, and I just find it to be extremely poor customer service.  I'm here a polite few minutes before my reservation, and I'm not trying to disrupt your pre-service ritual--I'm just trying to get out of this 34 degree April snowfall.  Once we were allowed inside at precisely 5, service was decent enough for our party of 6.  Our server made recommendations for how much food to order and was honest what we should expect for plate sizes.  My SO and I ordered the OXTAIL Montadito, the PIMIENTOS DE PADRONES, PUERRO A LA PLANCHA, and the BACALAO Plate.  We both liked the oxtail--the meat was super tender, and the funkily fragrant Mahon cheese was a wonderful complement.  The padrone peppers were tasty but nothing very special, while the spring onions were delightfully sweet and nicely charred.  The bacalao was nice and tender but had little flavor by itself--my favorite bite on the plate was the cauliflower.  My fiancee disliked the lemony notes in the green sauce on the plate, feeling it to be rather dissonant against the fish, or, in his words, \"This tastes like cheap lemon-lime jello.\"  Overall, nothing was UN-tasty, per se, and the oxtail could even be called excellent, but nothing blew our minds.  I enjoyed the flavors of the vegetable dishes, but they were both so oily that it was a bit repulsive.  My green onions' romesco sauce sat in a moat of grease.  Our friends who ordered the ALCACHOFA A LA PLANCHA felt the same way about their dish--their artichokes came with oil pooled in the hearts.  While I appreciate Severino's take on a tapas restaurant, I feel that $6 for 3 bites of oxtail on a baguette chip is complete departure from the spirit of a True Spanish tapas joint, which offers small bites as a free complement to ordered drinks.  I'm not suggesting his entire menu should be free of charge for a glass of the (pretty decent) red or white sangria--I'm only speculating whether the astonishing high prices for very little and non-lifechanging bites is taking advantage of a PIttsburgh food scene that jumps at anything new and fresh in this town.  My thoughts are, sadly, yes.",

The ambiance is warm, inviting, and youthful with no TVs (huge plus). I sat at the bar, but I did notice the tables are very close together, which I would have found off-putting.   I started with the Roasted Pickled Cucumber Conserva with spicy hummus and saffron yogurt ($8). The portion was very generous and the dish was very tasty (4.5/5).    Then ordered just one Jamon Croqueta ($6) because I was curious about the leek ash aioli. It was unreal. The flavor combinations were perfect (5/5).   Then had the tuna crudo ($16) and wow. This dish was spectacular and also generously portioned. The tuna was very fresh and paired perfectly with the accompanying ingredients - saffron sidra, fresh peach, chili oil, crispy shiitake, celery sprouts (5/5).    By this point I was too full to continue eating, but I did anyway and ordered the octopus ($14), which was another home run.    I accompanied my meal with a glass of their Rioja on tap ($6). I would pass on this wine. It was not very tasty.   There seemed to be many other tasty dishes that I wish I could have ordered as well. Either way, this is a \"can't miss\" restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "I'm going to precursor this review with the fact that as a 'newbie' to Pittsburgh, I have found most of my dining experiences sub par to any other place I have lived/visited. The Pittsburgh food scene likes to present itself as the next up and coming place but, so far, Morcilla has been the ONLY restaurant in Pittsburgh that has delivered a meal that I felt I paid a fair price for and received the exceptional quality, service, and ambiance that coincides with the pricing.   First of all, we had to make reservations weeks in advance - I don't view that as an accolade of any type, but now I can at minimum respect why we waited for 3 weeks for a table. This place gets PACKED and based on dining style it makes sense. You absolutely need time to luxuriate and enjoy each bite and sip of food and drink in front of you - so tables are occupied by the same parties for hours (we were there for at least 3 hours).  Second of all, our server (Sarah) was awesome - we had all hit hungry to the point that we wanted to order everything off the menu, she helped us reel ourselves in with exceptional advice and tips on her favorite dishes. She was super patient with us while we floundered through their salivating menu (seriously, I could order all the jamon and call it a day).   We ordered a bunch of food to share: almonds, beef tartar, mushrooms, croquetas de jamon, chicken wings, patatas bravas, the Cecina dried beef, and Churros in hazelnut chocolate sauce. Food wise - we were in HEAVEN. The meat melted in your mouth and the chicken wings fell right off the bone (I've never had a better chicken wing in my life). The mushrooms & patatas bravas were both absolutely delicious, there was a unique egg situation on top of the mushrooms that formed this delicious sauce, that just tied everything together so incredibly well. We finished off the delicious food with perfectly fried churros and a hazelnut chocolate sauce you'd want to take home and bathe in. Of  course we tied this all in with a delicious bottle of Tempranillo and topped the night off with rather alcoholic, but super smooth G&Ts.   My only issue with this spot is that I spent 3ish hours sitting in a rather uncomfortable chair (those could use an upgrade), but that still cannot detract me from saying I'd absolutely go back and sit in that chair for 3+ more hours to enjoy this spot as frequently as possible.   Thanks for the awesome experience, Morcilla!",

    "text": "Morcilla is, perhaps unsurprisingly given the quality of the food at Cure, definitely the best tapas restaurant in Pittsburgh. It has a very authentic atmosphere and reminds me of bars/restaurants in Spain, from the hanging hams to the bar-top display of tapas.  As this is a tapas restaurant, the menu is dominated by snacks (Pintxos, Montaditos, and Croquetas). Every snack I have tried here, across multiple visits, has been absolutely delicious. My favorites are the oxtail and jamon. Some reviewers have complained about being surprised by the price-to-quantity ratio of these snacks. I encourage you to look at the tapas that are on display on the bar as you enter the restaurant... this will give you a sense of the quantity of food you are getting, and you can decide which ones are worth it to you. They may not be huge, but the snacks I have tried are rich and delicious and worth it.  Then there are small plates to share. I haven't tried any of these yet, but they look great!  Finally, there are big platters that are meant to be shared (and commonly are combined with snacks and small plates). I tried the ribs platter on my first visit here. They were good, but not mind-blowing. I think we expected something a little more unique from a place like this, considering how inventive and amazing our experiences at Cure had been in the past.  In the one full dinner I've had here, we had churros for dessert. The sauce is delicious and the flavor of the churros was fine, but they were so thin!  I was expecting more substantive ones, based on my most recent experiences in Barcelona.  Not sure I would order this for dessert again.  Although the restaurant is usually pretty busy and advance reservations are necessary on many nights, the bar is first-come, first-serve and often has space. You can order any of the snacks to enjoy at the bar. I love that you can stop in on a whim and order a drink and a snack or two. It is such a luxury to have this new joint right down the block!",

Morcilla, thank you for allowing me to keep this reputation (although I cheated a little, I love Cure so I knew this was probably going to be good).  As soon as I walked in the door, something about the lighting and the decor made the restaurant seem cozy and cute.  Delicious looking pintxos lined the displays and hanging above us were huge blocks of meat. All of the food surrounding us made us even more excited to try the food.   We ordered a sampling of plates to share and each was quite good. Pigs feet and cheeks croquetas -- fried deliciousness. Basque butter lettuce salad -- an elevated take on Caesar salad, tasted fresh and good. Champignones a la plancha -- tasted almost like a tartare with that egg yolk mixed in, good. Pulpo -- haven't had a lot of octopus lately and this convinced me that I'm missing out, so good. The Costillas de la Mantanza -- a sweet, glazed plate of ribs; now maybe I'm biased because I love ribs, but these were probably my favorite!  We ended on the churros plate. The churros were dusted with a good heaping of sugar and a perfect blend of doughy and crispy. The chocolate was very dark and rich but I wish I could taste more hazelnut!  The short version of this review: Morcilla is great and you should go there. I love Cure, but I think I might love Morcilla even more!",

I think there are things that would make it better that are within reach.  That said this is a wonderful place which I enjoyed and would gladly return.  Things that should be worked on:  1.  The salumi is great but it isn't a dish in and of itself.  Getting paper thin slices of cured beef or pork is great but if all there is as accompaniment is a peperoncini and two thin baguette slices that are like crackers, well that's just not that interesting if I am there to dine.  If I was at the bar and this was a way to get me some salt so I had <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmore.beer&s=a9dc3b232c03332ed9f38cc5cc81566013eef139ccc3fade10fe851667ce7ca5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">more.beer</a> then I get it but these are not free giveaway dishes designed to encourage consumption of libations.  They are part of the dinner menu.  I would love to see the kitchen do something creative with the cured meats as in actually make something new with them.  2.  The seats are absolutely the least comfortable I have ever sat in in a restaurant not by a roadside in a third world country.   I get that turnover is good, but these seats made me want to stand and eat.  It's rare for seating to actually detract from a meal but these seats do (if you are lucky enough to sit on a bench good for you.  I didn't actually sit on a bench but unless the bench was on fire it would probably have been better than my chair.  Those are my 2 cents.  I actually think the veggish items were better than the straight up charcuterie. .",

    "text": "Last night four of us dined at Morcilla. Decor, ambience and service were all excellent. The drinks were great and I had the best mocktail I've had in Pittsburgh, yet. I wasn't sure what to expect as I do not really like Cure. I never felt like the flavors worked well together. Well, Justin Severino has figured it out. Morcilla is a slam dunk and my new contender for top restaurant in Pittsburgh. Here's what we ordered. Jamon iberico- to die for. This is THE delicacy in Spain so very appropriate that it was on the menu. Oxtail- to die for; Beef tartare- exploding with flavor; smoked pork conserva with pickled shrimp- the unexpected start of the evening;  queso de cabra- the whole table was swooning over the smoked goat cheese; bakalao, just the technique of this dish was ridiculous, the fish, the sauces, the flavors, a must-order; pig's feet and cheeks- great- toted as the best egg roll ever; pulpo- we got 2 orders, the first was cooked perfectly, the second was too tough. Also, the cream on the dish was too heavy, although the potato was delicious. I'd re-work this dish a bit. Duck leg was not a stand out either. Duck was a little tough and I thought the accompaniments to the dish, while great individually didn't really work together. We split the suckling pig which was outstanding. 4 great sauces, pickled vegetables and it filled us right up. Definitely recommend it when you have a table of more than 2. Morcilla is more expensive that other restaurants in Pittsburgh but well worth it. We all can't wait to go back.",

Had a table of three and ordered maybe 8 or 9 items from the menu, everything was delicious. I'm not normally a super adventurous eater, but there wasn't a single thing I wouldn't order again. Fresh cocktails, and very knowledgable and helpful staff for overwhelmed newbies. Just a few of our favorites were the salt cod croquetas, chorizo, and duck with grapefruit. Really impressed, and glad to have this restaurant in Pittsburgh!",

The food was market fresh and wonderful there. Justin Servino and staff bring that same freshness and creative cooking to Pgh. The tapas were very very good, my wife and I shared a variety of tastings. Then we decided to share an entree'. We ordered a rack of BBQ ribs. I was blown away! I don't know what I was expecting, but at first taste eyebrows arched, eyes widely opened, jaw dropped! Never had I tasted ribs like this, I can't even describe the savory & sweet sauce adequately. The ribs melted in your mouth. I certainly hope that they stay on the menu, I know how Justin likes to keep a menu moving from one thing to another, but this was a keeper. I am thankful Justin is in Pgh, that he left Monterey Calif, and other Cali locations, this is where he belongs stoking our foodie world.",

I've had everything on the menu at least twice and there isn't anything that I wouldn't recommend. You'll feel like you are in Spain when you walk in and see that the bar has no seats, a refrigerated display that holds ready-to-eat snacks (pintxos), and cured meat hanging from the ceiling. From ingredients to presentation, there is not one thing missing. You can order small plates and create a multi course experience or have a traditional meal by selecting a starter and a second course. I've been here a half dozen times and I'm 50/50 on small plates vs large plates. Just know that however you order, you will not make a mistake.. unless you don't order enough!",

Once seated, our server greeted us and took great care of us throughout the night.  I told him that I was a pescatarian and he marked up a menu showing me all the things I could have - this was such a great help and made dining that much easier.  The food was phenomenal, we ordered a little bit of everything -  my husband loved the Morcilla Sausage, and I couldn't get over the Bacalao (I could have liked the honey side sauce dish clean).  We also enjoyed Patatas Bravas, Totilla Espanola, and the Churro.   And honestly, our night would not have been complete without the Crema Catalana dessert - a frozen, crispy creme brule that was to die for!!!!

There is a small bar at the front of the restaurant, but no seats, just standing room.  The waiter was very attentive and explained the menu in detail, and recommended 2-3 small plates and then perhaps an entree each.  I will say that each menu item I tried was delicious.  My complaint was that, $40 later, I was still hungry, and wishing I'd had more.  Having been to the sister restaurant Cure, I knew the quality of food would be superb, and it was.  I just was hoping that with a more casual atmosphere would have either some more casual prices or portions that left me feeling satisfied.  I would probably go back for a great glass of bourbon and a quick appetizer, but with all of the great dining options in town these days, unless they offer dinner sized entrees to accompany their dinner-sized prices, I will likely take a walk down the street for a full meal.",

For two, we had the pintxos: oysters escabeche (very tasty); montaditos: beef tartare (interesting with the vegetable escabeche), foie gras (tasty), oxtail (savory / comforting and wanted more); croquetas: pig feet and cheeks (tasty, the pickled greens were interesting); plates: pulpo (the cilantro jus was curiously good, octopus tender), bacalao (salt cod - well prepared but maybe overwhelmed by the capers), and the lamb en moreno (the winner out of the small plates - the sumac yogurt fit remarkably well with the lamb). Shared a platter of the costillas de la matanza (killer ribs... pomegranate sherry caramel & coriander glaze) - which were perfectly fall off the bone tender & delicious.   Atmosphere was very laid back & comfortable, wait staff was attentive, service was well timed. With what we ordered we left satisfyingly full & not stuffed (the right ammount of food).  Having been to Cure several times, I had possibly unreasonable expectations that every dish would blow me away and leave me drooling for more - and as such this seemed hit or miss.  Full house, the kitchen was orderly and did not appear to be backed up or in a rush. Compliments to them.  Overall - the oysters, foie gras, oxtail, lamb meatballs, and the ribs were excellent.   My only complaint has nothing to do with the food. The flat sink in the restroom is ridiculously not utilitarian for something that's going to be used 150 times per night by buzzed patrons. But don't let that stop you from visiting, just go easy on the faucet at first :)",

    "text": "We had:  Lamb meatballs - not bad but not great  Foie Gras - excellent, but really small (one baguette slice spread with foie gras)  Crab butter and tarragon churro - awesome  Chorizo - good but simple (as in I'd make that at home next time with parma's chorizo)  Morcilla - ok, soft and loose texture that I didn't expect  Conchinillo - inedible  Red sangria - different, not bad  Syrah Rose on tap - meh  We were disappointed in our meal at Morcilla.  The service was well paced; we finished dinner in a reasonable amount of time, though there were spurts and lags, but this is expected in a tapas restaurant.  The seating was extra uncomfortable; we must be getting old because sitting on a hard seat with no padding for 2 hours really started to bother us.  The cocktails disappointed, and the food varied in quality from excellent to inedible.  Unfortunately, the excellent small plate (crab butter and tarragon churro) was quickly forgotten when our $45 platter (conchinillo) intended for 2 people proved to be inedible.   The quarter sized medallions of meat at the end of each chop were quite tasty, but you literally couldn't chew the rest of it.  The 'crispy skin' had obviously been recooked, leaving the skin so hard that you were afraid you would crack a tooth on it, so no yummy fried skin for us (a tragedy).  The fact that they hadn't cooked it slowly enough to break down the tough tissue meant you missed out on all those bites that blur the lines between meat and fat; oh yeah, it also meant that your double sized entree consisted of...5 bites of meat!?  The 3 sauces served with it were ok - the salsa verde had tarragon in it, which I love, elevating it to excellent.  The rustic bread was darkly toasted, which wouldn't have been a problem if the rest of the dish wasn't so hard to chew, but we had no energy left in our jaws.  When the server came by to ask how it was, we responded 'it's really tough'.  She nodded, replying, 'it's tough?' (to which we nodded vigorously), and she walked away never to mention it again.  Thanks for caring...    There was nothing on the cocktail list that called to us, and we weren't impressed with the sangria or the wine we had, so we didn't order more drinks, which kept our check down to $110.  Unfortunately, despite ordering slightly more than typically recommended (based on our double sized entree), I had to pull out the snacks as soon as we got home.   Ok, the conchinillo...I want to be fair...I'm sure this dish would be extremely difficult to cook, particularly in a restaurant setting.  Honestly, I don't know what they were going for; Severino is a butcher and a chef, so I'm really confused.  I believe this was basically 1/3 of a suckling crown roast, except with the full rib attached, grilled and cut into chops.  I've never heard of cooking a suckling pig hard and fast - way too much collagen, etc.  (though I am no chef and don't get much suckling pig, so what do I know?)  Maybe the chef tried to jump the shark on this one, but why does it stay on the menu?   The only reasonable conclusion I can make (because incompetence doesn't seem reasonable) is that I'm an idiot and totally misunderstood, that they really only intended you to eat the tenderloin/ribeye medallions (and maybe that's all that's edible for a suckling pig, I mean really, how often do you eat suckling pig?).  But that isn't enough for 1 person, much less 2, and what about the ribs (waste the ribs? really?? Is this True?).  And that does not excuse the skin; let's not forget that they ruined the skin.  Maybe our server misunderstood what was actually edible on the plate when describing the size of the dish.  Maybe we got the tail end of the pig, making those bites pitifully small.  Regardless, this was a total waste, and I'm talking about the animal, not my money (though that was sad too).  Even I, the unrepentant foie gras eater, lamented the little piggy that gave his life for 5 bites of meat.",

We appreciate the potential for music helping to establish atmosphere, but it should enhance the experience rather than detract.  In both restaurants the music selections were random and the volume so loud that natural conversation across the table was impossible. Be good to all the senses - match your music selections and volume with the quality of your food and you will be more deserving of the reputation as Pittsburgh's best.",

    "text": "Came here on a Friday night; dinner for two. It was my first time at Morcilla and I was blown away by the quality of the food. Definitely became one of my favorite places in Pittsburgh after my dinner experience here.  Food: 5/5 Given that Morcilla is a tapas-style restaurant, we ordered 4 dishes to start before adding 2 more as we finished our first selections. Everything we ordered was pretty on-point, and came out of the kitchen promptly.  We began the service with Surryano Ham charcuterie, which was deliciously topped with pecans and just the right amount of savoriness. Then came the Oxtail Montadito, which was recommended to us by our server. I liked the fullness of the flavor of the meat. We also got the Pig's Feet & Cheeks Croquetas - another recommendation and also very good. Next came the Pulpo Escabeche, a hearty heap of potatoes and perfectly-done octopus. After these courses, we ordered two more: the Spanish Mackerel (beautiful presentation), and the Duck Escabeche. We concluded the dinner with the hazelnut churros, freshly fried and paired with melted hazelnut chocolate.  Service: 5/5 Our waiter was friendly and offered numerous recommendations, and the speed by which the food came out was phenomenally speedy. We ordered more food as we felt the need to, and never had to wait long for them to arrive at our table despite it being prime dinner hour on a Friday evening.  Value: 4/5 Morcilla is not cheap, but for the quality of the food and the selection it was well worth the price. Our total bill came out to around $90 for the two of us, post tax & tip. We were both stuffed at the end, but not so much that we were uncomfortably so. The plates were perfect for sharing amongst two people, so we were able to enjoy many flavors at a reasonable cost. What I really liked about the menu was the fact that they offered 2oz portions of wine; this was perfect for me because I enjoy the taste of wine but cannot drink a lot of it.",

Started with three meats:  Chorizo, morcilla and something with apricots.  The experience was so unexpected and so darn delicious!  I had no idea charcuterie could taste like this.  Whammo!!!  We continued with Octopus which had fried chick peas, pickled cucumbers and mystery magicness, oxtail numminess, cucumber something that was only soso, beautifully charred ribs, smokey and sweet, raw tuna with peach or nectarine that was a flavor explosion.  Ended with peach sorbet made in Shadyside and churro with warm chocolate/fudge.  WOW!  Best meal I've had for a long time and so much fun!!!  Oh, I can't forget to tell you about their gin cocktails!!  Made with their own tonic and all sorts of botanicals, depending on the drink.  Mine had juniper berries, yellow mini marigold, rosemary. I also had their fabulous red sangria.    At the bar its like you're watching a cooking/mixologist show.  We were shocked that three hours had passed by.    Go.",

Well, now there are too many items I've eaten and who has the time? So here are my cliff notes: The food is amazing. The space is intimate. You can spend a ton of money or a modest amount, player's choice. If you are given a lemon to squeeze on something, use it. If you have a picky spouse, ditch them (or lie to them about the dish if you can get away with it). If you are given the opportunity to go, do it.",

We tried to make a same-day reservation and the website stated it was booked. Despite that, we called and were able to get a table. So I highly recommend calling even if the website says they're filled.   The concept here is small, shareable plates which is nice so you can order many plates to sample. The pricing doesn't appear to be that expensive but it can add up quickly. Their menu was a little difficult to interpret at first but once the server described the different sections, it was pretty simple. Basically, they have shaved dry meats, a selection of crostini, different croquettes, small plates and large plates.  We ordered somewhat of a feast so I won't list each item but each dish we tried was beautifully presented and had a complex array of flavors within each bite. My favorite was the Fois Gras which was savory, creamy and buttery, and sweet from the membrillo (a sweet jelly) placed on crunchy toasted bread. I feared my husband wouldn't like it but it turned out to be his favorite dish of the night as well.   This is a great place to go for a date night since everything is meant for sharing. The ambient lighting is also rather romantic. Overall, I loved the sophistication of the small bites and the flavors were out of this world.",

    "text": "As you can probably tell by my recent reviews, I've had a hankering for Spanish food lately.  Decided tonight to try Morcilla, given the great reviews across various rating sites and its a Justin Severino spot.  As someone who has been to Spain and Portugal a great deal, I have to say I was really disappointed with the food just not being authentic Spanish in any way.  I found the flavors to be pretty bland sadly.  We ordered the following dishes:  Serrano Ham (4/5) -- Was good serrano, but the amount for the serving was pretty small as compared to the same priced versions of the dish in Madrid.  Bacalo Croquetas (4.2/5) -- These were probably the best dish we at Morcilla.  Nice size croquetas and good quality cod.  The honey sauce was good, slightly strong, but a good pairing.  Jamon Croquetas (2.75/5) -- Would not consider these croquetas.  These were like one inch diameter balls that had a very hard exterior breading and minimal filling.  The aioli they were served on was an ok pairing, but the dish was very \"meh\".  Brandade de Bacalao (2.75/5) -- The bread served with the dish was a like a hard crouton.  The bacalao spread was very flat on flavor.  Octopus a la Plancha (2.5/5) -- Definitely far from authentic Spanish.  The octopus was tough, meaning it wasnt cooked properly.  Plating was sloppy, when the authentic version of the dish is so simply plated.  Patatas Bravas (2.75/5) -- The potatoes were not very crispy, but were very oily.  The aioli was average.  Charcoal Roasted Creamed Corn (2.9/5) -- One of the dishes that I have never seen on a menu in Spain, but decided to try it with local fresh corn in the region.  The dish was again average. Seemed under seasoned and bland.  Also though the temperature was off for the dish and should have been hot rather than very luke warm.  Costillas de la Matanza (2.7/5) -- The meat itself was real tender and good quality.  The sauce used those is overly sweet.  The crunch black olives just seemed like an off pair.  Churros (3.2/5) -- Churros were very good with the cinnamon sugar mixture.  The chocolate sauce, again, just was not authentic.  Brought the dish done.  Sangria (3.25/5) -- Adequate, but not sure I would order again at Morcilla.  Had extremely high hopes and cant say I would go back for a second round given the other options of proven commodities.  I really wanted to like it since I am a huge Spanish food fan, but the blandness of the food just really missed the mark.  I do think the inside of the restaurant is very well designed.  Intimate and warm.  So to wrap it up, the food was edible but just was mediocre.  A lot of bland flavors, under seasoned, and the biggest just not being authentic in any shape or form.  High expectations going in, but probably would not return.",

We ended up having to wait another half an hour for our table, but grabbed some seats at the bar and had a drink while we waited. I had a white sangria, which wasn't too sweet and came garnished beautifully with different fruits.   We ordered seven plates total, which ended up being too much for two people, but we just couldn't decide! Started out with the tuna crudo, sopressata, the jamon iberico (which is claimed to be one of the best hams in the world), and a roasted pepper dish. The tuna crudo was phenomenal, with so many contrasts of flavors. This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. The jamon iberico was also very good, although I don't know if I would pay the steep price for it again. I also enjoyed the sopressata and roasted peppers, but they didn't stand out as much as the other dishes we had.   Next, we had the mushrooms, ribs, and octopus. These were all absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend them all. The mushrooms in particular were so rich, and the egg yolk mixed in with them added a depth of flavor and creaminess. The ribs were fall off the bone tender but crispy on the outside, with a really yummy sauce. I also loved the octopus - it was cooked perfectly and wasn't chewy at all.   Service was attentive even though they were pretty busy. They staggered bringing out the dishes so that we had enough time to enjoy each one, and we never felt rushed. Morcilla was one of the best dining experiences that I've had in Pittsburgh, definitely give it a try if you can!",

    "text": "I was thrilled when I learned that Morcilla now offers lunch on both Sat and Sun between 11-2 pm. I was anxious to try out the food from Chef Severino who also is the chef at Cure in Upper Lawrenceville.  Although I had made a reservation when I arrived the place was virtually empty so the hostess seated me immediately. As I walked past the bar area I noticed that the montaditos were encased for full viewing which would help me decide which one I wanted to try. Montaditos are various cured meat toppings on toasted bread.  My waiter helped me interpret the menu and told me about the more popular dishes. I wanted the main course of bacalao which is salted black cod that came with cauliflower catalan,and capers and other items. Since I wanted to try I dessert I opted for a lighter motaditio which was sobrasada. This item had spreadable smoked salami, with apple and hazelnut.   Since I love ice tea I was pleased when they offered me their version which is made with red rooibos, saffron, and caramel for flavoring. While I was waiting for my food I could see the hanging meat at the bar area. My food was served very quickly and I was told what it was upon presentation. The sobrasada was very spicy and had a smoked taste to it. I got my bacalao next. This meal was cooked to perfection good! It also had a bit of a smoked taste to it.  Portion sizes tend to be small but this is what I would expect in a higher end restaurant. I noticed that dress is very casual for lunch.The place has that Spanish feel about you.   After I had finished my main course I opted for dessert. For $9.00 you get a choice of either churros or frozen crema catalana. I chose the latter since my waiter explained that it would be like a frozen creme brulee on top of a pine nut cookie. It was so good I was scraping the sides to get every morsel of it!  Many of the meats that are served here are raw so please note that when ordering. It is also noted on the bottom of the menu.  When I completed my meal they allowed me to take the menu home to show my family for a future visit. The staff is both knowledgeable and professional. My waiter made me feel very welcome here.  This is definitely a place where you can run up a high tab if you're not careful, however, for me I usually like to frequent places like this for lunch over dinner since lunch prices tend to be a bit less. Morcilla is located in lower Lawrenceville. Metered street parking is available.",

    "text": "I have had 3 experiences at Morcilla (so far...I imagine there are MANY more in the future).  Every time I went I've tried new things, in addition to 'old' favorites.  I was an exchange student in Northern Spain many years ago, the memories this food brings back...  I have 2 favorite dishes, although I think a 3rd was added to that list last night.     My first choice when walking into Morcilla is the Churro De Cangrejo y Estragon - this is a MUST ORDER (if you don't have a shell fish allergy!).  It is so, absolutely, utterly amazing and scrumptious.  Order it.  You won't be disappointed.    My second favorite dish - Endive and goat cheese.  I got this my first 2 visits - but was bummed to not see it on the menu last night.  However - I appreciate that they change their menu according to the season (hello asparagus!)  The new addition to my favorite list - Chorizo.  Holy yum.  That's all I can say about it - YUM.  I've tried almost all the Montaditos and have absolutely no complaints.  I've tried most of the Croquetas as well.  I will say - personally - I'm not a fan of the Queso de cabra.  It has quite a strong smokey flavor, but that's just me.  My friend I was with last night loved it.  The wait staff has been great (other than the hiccup the first visit where our waiter would only talk to my friend who had been there, but not me - who had never visited....weirdo.)    They recently added Sangria Rosada.  I've tried all 3 sangria's and this is by far my favorite.   I will say I had one frustration in this last visit however.  (But it surely won't keep me from returning.  Many.  Many times)  I made reservations for 3 - but one of the members of the party ended up having a work event she couldn't get out of.  I wanted to try to find someone to take her place, so i didn't call immediately to let them know.  Wednesday when the hostess called to confirm our reservation - she questioned why I had not called to let them know the reservation had changed.  \"Good thing I called\".  That wasn't necessary.  You are the first face your patrons see/hear. I thanked her and moved on.  However, we were running late getting to our reservation last night, so I called to let them know we would be 5 minutes late.  (I'm not one to no show!) She wasn't too pleasant AGAIN!  \"Well I guess we can keep your table\".  Um...what?!  At least I had the courtesy to call!   Morcilla hasn't been open long - and I have visited 3 times and have additional upcoming reservations.  A \"hiccup\" in the hostess will not keep me from going as the rest of the wait staff is incredibly friend and helpful.   Thank you Morcilla for being you - I can't wait to return.",

The restaurant had a warm ambiance with wooden decor, hipster lighting, and jamon hanging.  For dinner, we ordered the Serrano ham, tomate, chorizo, side of olives, machego queso, the potatoes, and squash.  It was way too much food for two, but we ordered with our eyes.  The a la carte charcuterie tapas came out individually (shame, cause I'd love some charcuterie plating) but the portions were so much bigger than I hoped for!  Every meat has topping accents.  For example, the Serrano ham has Spanish almonds.. the tomate was dipped in basil oil... and the chorizo had dates and blue cheese.  I love that it's not plain and naked.  My favorite out of the three was the tomate.  My friend loved the Serrano ham.  We both thought the cheese was too stinky with the chorizo!  Guess we aren't on the expert level of stinky cheese.  The side of olives was great! And I really loved the taste of the squash.  The potatoes with spicy mayo sauce was very dry.  It was the only dish we didn't enjoy.  Morcilla is everything I need in a tapas restaurant.  Ambiance, wine list, delicious tapas, amazing charcuterie!  I'm excited to try out the rest of the menu on my next visit.",

The quality and flavor of the olives was amazing.  I know you are thinking olives..what's the big deal?  Trust me and order them.  We really would have been fine with just olives and bread with the delicious olive oil for dipping.  However, we ordered several more dishes.  Each one tastier than the last.  The chorizo dish was incredible, the jamon' was spectacular, even the fried artichokes with aioli were delish.   We also had  a fish crudo that, again, was outstanding.  Comfortable seating area, not too close to your neighbor, nice selection of wines.  We will absolutely come back if we are ever in Pittsburgh again.",

We had no reservation on a Thursday at 7:30. So glad we arrived when we did, two other couples breezed in right after us. We got a bar seat which was amazing because we were inches from the charcuterie station, and to the right was the raw bar. From our height we could see into the kitchen as well. This place is a well-oiled machine. The staff have all been together for over a year. I talked to the GM, Raoul, and extended my compliments. He was humble, yet busy, and excused himself to go back to helping his team.   Food:. Incredible. We had All The Meats. And wine - we asked for suggestions for wine, tasted samples and chose.   There are at least three flavors to everything you eat. For example the marcona almonds that you eat have lavender sugar, sea salt and pepper; it's quite divine.  If you like to eat by choosing flavors from a bounty that is all within hands reach  - if you like tasting fennel pollen, rendered fat from dry-aged meats (I asked Nathan what he did with the Iberico Jambon when he cut it to make a plate for a guest), and smoked ice with your drink, then this is the place to go.",

For two, we ordered 8 items, which cost ~100 without tax and tip. - Warm Bread w/olive oil - Serrano Ham. The best I've ever had, no joke. 9/10. - Chorizo. Good, but slightly too much oil. 6/10 - Small plate: Octopus. Too tough and salty for our taste. 5/10 - Small plate: Morcilla sausage. I'm not the biggest fan of sausage, but this was my favorite! Melts in your mouth. 9/10 - Small plate: Oxtail. 7/10 - Small plate: Ribs. My SO's favorite and my second favorite - so tender that it just falls off the bone. 9/10 - Dessert: Catalana. Really good and not overbearingly sweet like some creme brulees! 8/10  The stars of the show were definitely the Serrano ham, the Morcilla sausage, the ribs, and the Catalana. Would also come back for the oxtail! The food is just too damn good here.",

Amazing: tortilla espanola, any of the cured meat, homemade soft drinks, sangria, croquetas.  Just Okay: We didn't love the lamb meatballs, they seem to be a crowd favorite so maybe it was just our night, but they were REALLY intense in flavor, a little too much for us.  The crab churros also were just okay.  They were a little dry, and the dipping sauce was good but heavy, so if you used it to outweigh the dryness, the flavor was way too much.   Overall it's definitely a place I'd recommend.  I think next time I'll focus on the cured meat dishes because they really were outstanding.",

It felt like a ski chalet with the dim lights and beams. There was no brushed nickel or repurposed wood as far as I could tell, which I found to be refreshing.   The meal was incredibly good. I might be intimidated by the menu on my own but the server was so knowledgeable and helpful that we just let her guide us and everything fell together perfectly. The charcuterie plate was so flavorful. There was some nutty meat, chorizo, blood sausage with dates and blue or Gorgonzola cheese. The almonds were fantastic; I ate nearly half the bowl. Ooohhh!!! There was an egg something or other, a frittata maybe? Finally, we ended with a suckling pig with the crispest skin and pork that melted in my mouth.   I'd eat pretty much anything this guy makes. Great experience. They're really doing something special there. Can't wait to go back.",

All the cured meats had a similar sweet flavor that must be unique to the restaurant. The foie Blanc was pretty good. The duck was almost very good but it seemed like something was lacking. The jamon croquettes seemed like they were trying to revamp the Dutch croquettes/bitterballens but the breading/shell was very strange and I didn't like it at all.   Atmosphere was really nice. The waiters and staff were all super friendly. Definitely worth trying but not sure if I would go back again.",

It could have been that I was just stuffed with everything else we consumed.  We started with two gin and tonics (they make their own tonic).  The we had some of the Charcuterie, as must if you go here.  Although, the menu has a lot of meat and fish, there are items for vegetarians (which my gf is) to eat.  The ambiance is very nice also.

The open air entrance to the bar called us in from the street and we were greeted by a friendly bartender before our party of six was seated by the kitchen. Our waiter (Beautiful Dave...there a lot of Daves apparently, but this guy is extremely easy on the eyes) expertly described the menu offerings and aging processes of the meats. He also carefully reviewed all of the vegetarian options for our friend. Hunky-ness aside, he was easily one of the best waiters we have ever had.  The bar offerings were wonderful, especially the Flor de Jarez. My friend swore that angels must have cried tears into it!  We ordered numerous plates for sharing, each one unique and delicious, especially the Puerto a la Plancha and Alcachofa a la Plancha.  Our only regret is that the kitchen activity was not viewable even though our seats were right next to it. We would have enjoyed watching the magic happen. Our dinner reservations will be made a month in advance for our next visit. Can't wait!",

They have been closed for a few months after a pipe bursted on the floor above them, but reopened a week ago. I noticed a couple changes to the menu that disappointed me on our first time back. The one blaring change was the switch from Spanish menu options like \"pinxtos\" to small plates. They also removed the \"montaditos\" options which was one of my favorite courses. The main thing that drew me too this restaurant initially was the feeling of being immersed Basque culture. However, like other restaurants, they \"dumb\" down their menus to appease the masses. I really thought Justin Severino was above that but I guess no one is immune. The food is still excellently prepared and service is impeccable. We were even given a complementary glass of wine while the bottle we ordered was chilling. Morcilla offers an incredible selection of Sherry's and wine. I am just distraught to see one of my favorite restaurants back slide.",

    "text": "The food here blew me away - no exaggeration. My mom loved it too, and she's picky! The food here puts tapas restaurants from San Francisco to shame.   Highlights (hard to pick out what we liked best because it was all so delicious): - Salmon crudo - holy moly, how do they get the mushrooms so crispy? The salmon melted in my mouth and the apples were perfectly spiced. - Who cooks for you farm mesclun green salad - More mushroom amazingness mixed into crisp greens and tangy dressing. I usually hate goat cheese, but I couldn't get enough of the smoked one in this salad. The smokiness cancels out the gaminess which is what I can't stand about garden variety goat cheese.  - Jamon Iberico - super thinly sliced and full of flavor especially when paired with the marcona almonds that come on top of this dish - Queso en aceite - bread so warm i had to wait before I could comfortably handle it, flavorful manchego cheese that isn't too salty, and fragrant olive oil - hints of orange zest. Ah! We swiped every last drop of olive oil from the dish. - Crema catalina - Mom won't stop raving about this dessert even though it ended hours ago. It's more like a parfait with a candied nut layer on the bottom, a citrusy ice cream in the middle, and maple-flavored whipped topping (denser than whipped cream but fluffier than pudding) on top. I've never tasted anything like it, and I pray I'm lucky enough to someday taste it again.   The attentive service (fresh plates ever 2-3 dishes, constant water refills) was the icing on the cake to an incredible dining experience.",

Came here on a weeknight early evening and we were not able to get a table for 2 (highly recommend reservations) but they also serve a full menu at the bar and provide amazing service! I ordered the beefeater gin and tonic all evening. I just recently tried to go back for that specific drink just because I loved it so much. The bartender also crafted a delicious drink for my friend based on her preferences. I absolutely love the tapas menu for sharing and the queso en aceite was my favorite. It was this delicious cheese dish and even after all the cheese was gone the oil was great for dipping bread in.",

For all you Spain lovers, Morcilla is the place where you can recreate the classic long, late dinner, savoring good food + wine (on draft!) and engaging in lively banter with close friends 'n family. It's worth trying at least one charcuterie selection...a highlight for us being the housemade Fuet. The imported Serrano Ham was another delectable delight. From the dozen tapas we sampled, the faves included Pork Belly, Scallops a la Plancha, Mussels, and Patatas Bravas. Were there disappointments? Croquetas de Jamon and Ribs fell a bit short, but overall the accolades are well deserved. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and personable as well. A return visit will have to wait for a special occasion for sure.",

Cure is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh, and even though Morcilla is from the same team, I probably should have tempered my expectations given that Morcilla is a completely different dining experience than your typical sit down meal.   Everything was good, don't get me wrong, but none of the plates (which looked beautiful by the way) were out of this world amazing.    Definitely an ambitious restaurant (for Pittsburgh) that I appreciate and am happy to see is doing well.  Even though I wasn't too high on any of the plates, I know how talented Chef Severino and his team are, and I 100%  plan on visiting again.",

The food is good, but I can't justify spending that much money and walking away hungry, even if the dishes were interesting and tasty.  I came with 3 other people and we tried to sample a bunch of things. Most dishes were really hard to share, which I found strange for a tapas place since I thought the point was to share and sample. We ordered nearly half the menu trying to get full, by to no avail. I will mention that we had to avoid pork, so maybe if we ordered one of the large dishes which were pork based maybe we could have been full.  I think this place would be good for a pre-dinner appetizers or small nibble and drinks, but don't come here and expect to be full!",

The tastes were varied between sweet and savory, and everything was cooked to perfection. However, since Morcilla had only recently started serving brunch, there were a few kinks to work out. Namely, the coffee was very weak. However, our waiter let us know that we would not be charged for the coffee - without us even mentioning it. The other issue was that the waiter put many of another table's dishes on our check. Without realizing, we paid. However, only a few minutes later, he came back, apologized and explained what had happened, and proceeded to resolve the issue quickly and efficiently. I was overall very impressed with the service and quality of food we received.",

    "text": "Wow just wow. I had been wanting to try this place ever since I saw it featured in Bon Appetit's Hottest New Restaurants in 2016. Came here on a friday around 5 ish. It is a very cozy restaurant with warm lighting. Once we were seated, our server went through the menu telling us her favorites and recommendations. It was helpful as the menu can be a bit overwhelming and we just wanted to order everything.   We ended up ordering the fuet, chorizo, queso en aceite, bacalao, leeks a la parilla, the costillas de la matanza, and the crema catalana. First the queso en aceite came out and it was amazing. The warm bread dipped in the olive oil and marinated manchego was just delicious. Then the salami and chorizo came out. The salami had hints of garlic and was perfect with the toasted bread and pickled peppers. The chorizo took some getting used to as I had never had dates, blue cheese, and chorizo before. I definitely would love to come back to try the charcuterie platter of all the meats!  The bacalao was the only thing I didn't love although my friend thought it was great. The fish was shredded so it just had a weird consistency to me. Then the ribs and leek came out. The ribs were amazing. They were tender on the inside and crispy on the outside. The leek was also unique. Finally for dessert we had the crema catalana which was basically a frozen creme brulee. It was a perfect way to end a wonderful meal.  Although the portions were not huge we were both still full. It was great sharing and trying a wide variety of dishes. I honestly liked coming earlier, because it wasn't as crowded yet. By the time we left it was very loud. I know though I will be back as their menu changes monthly!",

Is this place good for big groups (over 6)? No, definitely not. It's really small inside.   This was my first time trying Spanish tapas and I went all in with the octopus a la plancha and the costillas de la matanza. I never tried octopus tentacles before and I wasn't sure what to expect. I'm not a big fan of rubbery textures so I was hoping for the best.  The octopus came out on a sesame yogurt base, cucumbers, crispy pickled chickpeas and merguez spice. The octopus was cooked to perfection and almost caramelized exterior. The interior wasn't rubbery what so ever, but very tender. I highly recommend this dish (just keep in mind the menu changes often). The costillas de la matanza (baby back ribs) was dressed in a pomegranate sherry caramel, scallions, coriander, and crunchy black olive. The ribs fell right off the bone and were nice and crispy. I did try the beef tartare and chicharones both equally delicious! Pretty sure this is the type of restaurant where everything is prepared to perfection.   I wish I could say the same about the service. Our waitress left a lasting impression of having absolutely no personality at all. She couldn't have had her nose anymore up in the air than she did that night. She acted like we did a disservice to her by not sharing our plates. My friend also had her as a waitress at his previous visit and mentioned that she acted like that back then too. Service can and will ruin a business. I don't think that waiting tables is her calling.",

The chorizo, Morcilla sausage, pork loin, Serrano ham, and spreadable selections were the standouts. You can't go wrong with that menu.  Jamon croquettes were terrific as was the manchego cheese. We ordered a few tapas for our mains including duck, oxtail, Brussels sprouts, and artichokes. The meats were delicious. The vegetables fell short. The Brussels sprouts were quite vinegary and the artichokes were just a bit boring.  Churros and crema Catalana were both great desserts. Overall, a great experience with just a few shortcomings.",

Upon entering, I was reminded of some of the restaurants in Spain.  The Jambon hanging from the ceiling is truly a sight...and I do not eat pork.  We were promptly seated at our table.  Drinks came quickly.  The wine arrived without delay.  In True tapas fashion, we ordered a series of dishes for the table.  The gazpacho was amazing -- one of the best I have had.  The potatoe bravas were great - the aoli was really flavorful.    I would also recommend the Octopus which was also a great dish.  I was encouraged to try the ox tail as my buddy swears by it.  I did not like but he seemed to love it.  The salads were great.   Perhaps my favorite dish was the cauliflower.     We had the churro for desert.  This was a little disappointing.  I would not get it again.  But the cappuccino was nicely done as was the sherry.  So the desert drinks more than made up for it.  I would love to come back and try more things on the menu!",

    "text": "As a fanatic of Justin Severino's other Pittsburgh restaurant, Cure, I knew I was in for a treat when visiting Morcilla. What I didn't expect was for it to pass Cure as my favorite spot in Pittsburgh. My dinner experience could not have been better.   Morcilla is a Spanish, tapas restaurant with an emphasis on cured meats. The chef is renown in the US for his curing ability and it shows in every dish. The space itself is unique but fits the food. You almost feel that you are in the family dining room in a Spanish Villa.  Like Cure, the bar staff are exceptional the drinks are phenomenal. I did not have a bad drink and tried four throughout the night. If you'd like something off menu let them know what flavors you appreciate in a cocktail and they will do their best to make a unique drink for you.   I ordered the Family Feast with my girlfriend. At only $45 per person for a full four course meal, it is the best prix fixe experience in Pittsburgh. Not only is it four courses, but there are a large number of plates per course. All in all we shared all of the following: MANZANILLA OLIVES - citrus, rosemary, olive oil, MARCONA ALMONDS - lavender sugar, sea salt, extra virgin olive oil, WARM BREAD - olive oil, MORCILLA ACHORIZADA - pork salami, pigs blood, piquillo pepper conserva, PIMENTONE CHEESE MONTADITO - mahon, idiazabal, manchego, queso de cabra, fermented iberian chili, piquillo peppers, cucumber, dill, OCTOPUS A LA PLANCHA - sesame yogurt, cucumbers, crispy pickled chickpeas, merguez spice, CHAMPINONES A LA PLANCHA - oyster mushrooms, egg yolk, shallot, bread, ARROZ CON PITU DE CALEYA - cider braised chicken, calasparra rice, herbs, BRANDADE DE BACALAO MONTADITO - salt cod, caramelized crab, lemon oil, CHURROS with chocolate hazelnut fondue.  We could barely finish 2/3 of what the brought us and had to take home some leftovers. After trying every dish it was almost impossible to pick favorites. The first course offers the most dishes and largest variety of flavors. The cured meats were salty and full of spices that complimented the meat perfectly. The lavender almonds were also divine.  The small and large plates were absolute perfection. The meatiness of the octopus was cut perfectly by the yogurt sauce, the Championes A La Plancha blew me away. I didn't expect that amount of savory flavor to come from a seemingly simple dish, but it was one in the top of the night for me. The chicken was another dish that seemed simple but is accompanied by a rich variety of flavor that elevates it beyond normal chicken dishes.   I cannot wait to go back, the food is unique in Pittsburgh and could not be more perfectly executed.   TLDR: Order drinks, order the prix fixe (\"family style\") and gorge on delicious savory, salty flavors in unique dishes that you haven't experienced before. Enjoy some of the finest dinners Pittsburgh has to offer.",

Ordering tapas is pretty challenging when everyone at the table is demanding, but our waiter handed it very well. I also appreciated that he warned me about items that seemed vegetarian but were not (e.g. the butternut squash).  Less positive:  1. As you could probably tell, not a lot of vegetarian stuff. 2. It's very, very loud. We went on a Friday night and it was pretty crowded - we were at one of the tables in the center, and we pretty much had to yell the entire night.",

A bit salty but our waiter gave us    extra bread to eat it with. The garlic and capers added a lot to the dish! Very nice starter.         Oxtail: Caramelized onion and mahon cheese. Delicious!

It was too vinegary and overwhelming. Our waiter took it off our bill for us.",

Located in the trendy Lawrenceville, it boasts an outstanding menu of savory tapas. I went with my friend for brunch. It was hard to decide between brunch and dinner but brunch is very reasonably priced. We each ordered the eggs Benedict with Iberia ham as a buttery hollandaise. It is a meal I will never forget.  The dish was perfectly balanced with smokiness and sweetness with the savory hollandaise in between. Every bite was fantastic. I will be back, and you should go too.",

They weren't exactly prepared for the infants but we figured it out. Granted one carseat was on the floor and the other on the bench. But not horrible - it isn't a kid place. The service was excellent. Zack took time to explain the menu, give advice on how/what to order based on the party, and didn't rush us through our meal. He didn't just say \"everything on the menu is good.\"  He gave recommendations about tapas after he saw what we liked as charcuterie. I had the oxtail toast the first time and the goat cheese and caramelized onion omelet the second time. Both were amazing. Dressing on the mixed greens with the omelet was fabulous. I could drink that stuff. Definitely try the chorizo with dates and bleu cheese. The flavors are amazing together. And lastly get the French press coffee. Go for the big pot because you are going to want more.",

From the decor and expertise of the staff, to the hams hanging from the ceiling and the lively, social brightness, I felt at home. Friend and I sat at the bar, as there was no unreserved or untaken spots in the back, and did not regret it. The olives were tasty and fresh, the croquetas were hot and delicious, the jamon serrano was perfectly sliced and topped with delicious, crunchy almonds. We ordered tortilla espanola, as well, which was too cold for my liking, as it should be cool, or room temp, but not straight-out-of-the-fridge cold. For the main dish we shared pork belly a la plancha, incredible! Crispy, salty, porky perfection. Everything was beyond my expectations, and then we decided to just go for it, and get dessert. Un cafe cortado y.. Crema Catalana.. does that sound good? Seriously the best dessert I've had, this side of the Atlantic or the other. It is pricey, especially for small dishes of tapas that often come for free in Spain, but if you are looking to try something new, or have a craving for something Iberian, it is 100% worth the price.",

We went on a couple date and started with the All The Meats (it's a perfect way to try all of the house made meats and small cold appetizers). Each meat was unique and delicious a you could even taste the chamomile in the homemade salami. The olives melted in your mouth and the lavender almonds were surprisingly delicious (who would think to put lavender on almonds). We also tried the tortilla espanola (which was my least favorite dish), the shrimp and ribs. The brussel sprouts with smoked goat cheese were some of the best I've tasted. And the service was wonderful and thorough!",

The menu is tapas based, which might disappoint some who don't understand that they really are supposed to be quite small plates, but the quality is excellent and you get to try so many more things this way! I went with four people total and I'd say that was the perfect number so that you could try a lot of different plates with everyone still getting a bite of each.  The restaurant is actually quite small with limited seating, so you'll likely want to make a reservation. It has an open kitchen and a relaxed, upscale vibe with some Spanish flair. The bar portion in the front is standing only and a great place to grab a drink or try some of their smallest dishes, pinchos and montaditos. The service was great as well. While the food is quite pricey, you are going to have an amazing experience and it is definitely worth it!",

I lived in Miami for several years and have eaten at many Spanish-style tapas restaurants, but I have never been to a tapas restaurant quite like this (and I don't mean that in a good way). While yes, \"tapas\" is Spanish for \"snacks\", I expected that a $14 duck plate would consist of a bit more than literally two bites of duck and a couple slices of apple. The other plates and montaditos we tried also consisted of extremely small tapas portions.

    "text": "Top five meals of my life. Hands down.  Based on reviews and word of mouth, my husband and I chose Morcilla to celebrate our 10 year wedding anniversary. It was difficult to get a later dinner reservation, but we were very pleased with a 4:15 seating. Upon arrival the restaurant was rather quiet (this changed as our visit continued which was the only draw back for me). To start, my husband had a beer and I had a Gin & Tonic with one of the lovely gins Morcilla offers. I loved the presentation of my drink with fruit, rosemary, and star anise! As for food, we tried the oxtail, chorizo, sobrasada, and the pigs feet and cheek croqueta. All of which were fantastic, but for me the sobrasada and oxtail were the home runs. Tip: if you're sharing, order two oxtail. You're really not going to want to share. Finally, we ordered two plates: the Cordero en Moreno (lamb meatballs) and the Pulpo Escabeche (octopus). Both were perfection. The octopus was tender and delicious, and the meatballs were unique and fantastic. Aside from the increasing noise level as our visit wore on, were beyond pleased with our visit to Morcilla. Remember this is a tapas and small plates restaurant- you're not going to find a huge entree here. With that said, we spent $88 on three alcoholic beverages, after dinner espresso, and enough food that we certainly didn't leave hungry. To me, that's a pretty fair price for a restaurant at this level!",

There are mostly highlights but a few minor things that I am sure will evolve since only open a week or so.  We stopped in for a drink and some small plates. The bar is a stand up bar and limits orders from the menus of small plates, just what we wanted to try.  Morcilla cures meats in house so we decided to give them a try.  There is a small case of the many of the menu items on display at the end of bar.  The bar staff was good and friendly.  It was nice to be able to talk with the staff while they mixed sangria and some interesting drinks. We tasted a few of the wines available as a 2 oz. pour.  Not real familiar with some of the Spanish wines, so asked the bar staff for some info on a couple of the wines.  While they were helpful, I think a little more info/description would be helpful.  One was compared to a french wine but did not get a real description.  I would think this will change over time, but a little more of a description would be helpful. One of the wines tasted was probably open overnight and seemed to be a little oxidized but was drinkable.  The others were quite good. We had a couple of the Montaditos (sandwiches), the  Matrimony was terrific, the beef tartare was good but it probably had just a little to much aiolo, The Cecina of cured dried beef  and the Morcilla sausage were both excellent.    The menu includes some Jamon and seafood that we did not get to try, but will definitely come back to sample.  Will have to stop in with more time and have a dinner, too,",

Yes, it's expensive and the portions are small, but it was worth it.  For drinks, my boyfriend had 2 beers and I had the Patxaran Espumosa which was a simple cocktail containing only 2 ingredients: cava and patxaran (a Spanish liqueur that kind of tastes like berries). My cocktail was small but the taste was on point.   For food, we got the following: Chorizo - Small thin slices of chorizo w/ dates and Cabrales cheese...delicious balance of salty and sweet! This was one of my favorites of the night. Poquillo Rellenos de Bacalao - A pepper filled w/ potato. I thought this was just okay but I am biased because I don't normally like peppers. Churro de Cangrejo y Estragon - This was amazing! This is essentially fried dough made with crab and tarragon. Comes with a creamy dipping sauce. Foie Gras Croquetas - Probably my least favorite dish. Tasted okay. Loved the rhubarb sauce but I have come to the conclusion that I am just not a huge fan of foie gras. Pigs Feet and Cheeks Croqueta - Good but didn't stand out. Alitas de Pollo en Adobo - WOW! We loved, loved, loved these chicken wings. These were the most expensive chicken wings we have ever had ($14 for 6), but they are amazing. Perfectly crisp skin, sauce was unique and full of flavor. Costillas de la Matanza - Smoked baby back pork ribs. Fall of the bone. They had a little too much pork flavor for me..I know, sounds weird :P  We will be back for sure!",

All you need is the bar area :) This old mayor's office turned restaurant is a fun place to check out with friends if you are just looking for a couple drinks and some fun appetizers! After being there twice just at the bar area, we finally got seated for an actual meal the third time. Although after eating a sit down meal, I have to say the best part about the restaurant is the small plates and the drinks! No need to get seats for that! Anything they have on the display case at the front of the restaurant is worth trying (anywhere from foie gras to ox tail)! I was not disappointed. The drinks they serve are also pretty fun to try! If you are willing to pay, try their Jamon Iberico Bellota appetizer. It's an interesting pairing of almond and the cured meat. As for main entree, we tried the grilled octopus (Pulpo). It was pretty good, but maybe not the best ever. The lamb meatballs (Cordero en Moreno) was definitely something worth trying if you like lamb. Lastly the artichoke was more of a one time interesting dish to try. After peeling layers of it, we finally got to the edible part, but there wasn't much left to eat haha. Overall, would recommend anyone to try the small plates and just stand around the bar and order fun drinks!",

The veg dishes were creative but the bill was SO high for measly bites. The portions were extra small for tapas. It would have been nice to have a good crusty bread to go along with the food.

They succeeded, to say the least.    The atmosphere is cool and quaint.  The waitstaff was attentive and informative.  The manager and the owner both checked in on us during our meal.  And the food was tremendous - in concept, flavor, and presentation. We didn't even get to sample any of the large plates as we loaded up on pintxos and other smaller items (about 10 in total!) and our only regret was that we got filled up and couldn't try the whole menu - we plan to in the near future.  I previously lived in New York and San Francisco and I would put this up against any similar restaurant in either of those food meccas.  Well done!",

The oxtail is a near out-of-body experience with its buttery texture and deep, beefy flavor. And the sweet/acidic summer goodness of the the Tomato & Peach salad was refreshing. The mushrooms are a meal in themselves - amazing. And the BBQ ribs were the absolute best I have ever eaten, hands down, in every way. They come off the bone clean, in meaty chunks, and then fell part in your mouth. Crispy outside/ tender and juicy inside without drowning in fat or sauce. What a great meal. We'll be back!",

There were SO many people working when we went - it was amusing. But made for good service.  The food is very good. It is mostly small plates. There are bigger plates I believe, but overall, I would say don't expect to come here for a real dinner. Definitely a pricey, pre-dinner snack. The drinks are great - as is typical of Lawrenceville, very cool cocktails.   We got a variety of things - wings, oxtail, corn on the cob and a few others - it was all very good. I really couldn't complain about anything. It is a bit of a complex menu if you aren't a total foodie.    Two drinks and 4 or 5 small plates brought us a bill of about $100.

Maybe growing pains, maybe an off night...whatever it was, the second and third times were both among the best dining experiences I've had in Pittsburgh.    My date has a nut allergy, and there are lots of nuts on the menu.  The waiter took the menu back to the kitchen.  He returned with two items crossed off the list and several items underlined.  The crosses were dishes he said couldn't be made without nuts.  The underlines were nuts that could be removed from the dish.    We took our new menu so we could pick something that could be made without nuts.  And so she is still alive today.  Thank you, Morcilla!  I've developed a habit of tracking \"the best thing I ate in (insert year)\" and although 2019 is still a bit green for this to mean much...  The oxtail montadito, oxtail, with caramelized onion and mahon cheese on a small baguette is it.  Flawless dish.  The cheese bubbled and crisped around the edges and gave it a nice crunch on the outside, but melted on the inside.  The oxtail was so savory and of course...carmelized onions...always...it all blended sooooo well.  The tapas menu consists of smaller, shareable (by two) plates, so there's really no reason why every visit to Morcilla can't have oxtail montadito as part of the experience.    But...everything else was great too.  Everything.    Most of the time I gloss over the coffee in reviews.  More often than not because even in really good restaurants it is not noteworthy.  It's...just coffee.  I asked the waiter what cortada was.  He explained it as lighter and less deep/rich (he used more words but I forgot them).  And I said, \"what do you have that's heavier and more rich and he said, \"cafe con leche\" which I assume is what it translates to...coffee with milk, but was so syrupy thick and rich that I have to be doing my coffee with milk at home incorrectly.  Anyway...not glossing over it, the coffee after dinner was great.    We shared an appetizer, three small plates and a dessert and the bill was really pretty reasonable.    Definite repeat visits moving forward.",

    "text": "Looking back on the review I wrote from last year, it seems the menu has switched up quite a bit, which is always good in my book!   I like that they were easily able to accommodate me being gluten free. The waitress was really nice about explaining the dishes I could get, which were mostly everything, save for a few items. Those few items were easily modified too. Happy to hear that!   The highlights were the beet conserva, fried artichokes, manzanilla olives, mackerel escabeche and serrano ham were all delicious. I could eat a whole pile of the marcona almonds myself. These are always a must when I come here.   I did feel like we went back and forth between hits and misses. The octopus, which was so good last time, was overcooked and tough.  I'm a firm believer of telling the truth when a server asked, so we did let her know how tough the octopus was. The lamb dish was good, but the sausage was actually better than the lamb because of how much sauce was in the dish. The accompanying paella didn't have much flavor.   The chorizo, a favorite of mine, had so much vanilla and date sauce I could barely taste the chorizo. When I did get hints, I liked it, but could have done without so much sauce. And don't get me wrong, I love me some sauce, so it was weird how heavy they were with all the sauces.  The sangria we ordered was watered down and didn't seem like the wine ratio was right. I was bummed. But a bottle of red wine did the trick. I'm no wine expert, but it seems you can't go wrong with their excellent selection of wines.   None of the dishes were terrible, other than the overcooked octopus. I know they can do better and have an excellent head chef/owner. I don't know if maybe this was an off night? I would definitely head back in and try it out again.",

    "text": "wowza. This place is AMAZING! It's tapas style, which is a great way to try a bunch of different items on the menu. I just came back from a trip to Spain, so this place was bringing back some great memories from my trip. We got here around 5:15 on a Friday and it was just starting to get busy. I can see the space filling up and there being a wait during the later hours of the evening. The atmosphere was cozy and the service was on point.   First off, the sangria was delicious - my friend ordered the red sangria while I ordered the white. Neither were overly sweet and both were beautifully presented. As for food, we ordered the pimentone cheese montadito, the serrano ham charcuterie, the padron pepper salami charcuturie, fried artichokes, oxtail montadito, octopus a la plancha, costillas de la matanza, and the warm bread. To finish, we got the churros! For two people, this amount of food + drinks was more than enough to be full. Our favorites were the pimentone cheese, the octopus, and the ribs (costillas de la matanza).   Can I just talk about the ribs for a second. WOW. Honestly these may be the best ribs I've ever had. I'm not a huge rib person, but these were so tender and juicy - the pomegranate sherry sauce complemented the saltiness of the meat, all while the olives balanced out the sweet and savoriness of the dish. I'm still dreaming out this dish.   I highly recommend everyone checking out this restaurant! It's definitely worth the price and I will be back again. I'm told their menu changes frequently, so I'm excited to try out their other creations.",

    "text": "We dined here on a Saturday night - restaurant was far more casual than we thought it would be. Very dark inside but it's all part of the ambience. Our waitress was friendly and genuine throughout. She spoke slowly and surely, and was very knowledgeable about portion sizes.   My husband isn't a pork eater, so we opted to have two snack menu items and two large plates. We ordered the warm bread, sourdough with anchovy and tomato conserve, laurel hill trout, and the chicken arroz. The half a baguette (which we were told is from Five Points - our favorite bakery) was heated up to perfection and served with a delicious her infused olive oil. The sourdough was not impressive. Overly crispy (read: hard) particularly the crust, lacking flavor in general. We were told by the waitresses that the overly crisp edges were authentic, so we took her word for it. The two large plates were perfectly done and highly recommended. The trout was served while, but deboned and cooked to perfection. The chicken with rice was served paella style and had lovely crispy bits to scrape up. The chicken was cooked so perfectly, it has a duck like flavor and texture.   We did not order any alcohol or desserts, so we cannot comment on those. Our bill came up to $140 for two with a tip. We would definitely go back for the large plates, but may pass on the other snack/small plates.",

Morcilla offers some of my favorite things, including beautiful beets, exceptional ribs, perfectly cooked seafood, and all the charcuterie including spreadable salami and a surprise star, the Cecina. This cured beef upstaged a lot of the pork (as we all know, the finest meat to cure) with it's roasted pepper conserva. Plus it all looks damn good, in addition to being tasty.  2. The bar program. I could drink the Piel de Sapo for the rest of my life, and the other cocktails I tried were nearly as good. Toss in some great sangria, the best sherry selection I may have ever seen, and the awesome and insane cider pour thingy (technical term) happening at the front of the bar, and there's nothing not to love.  3. The service. We almost always sit at the bar, and there's very few places where that's a better call. The bartenders know their biz, make great recommendations, and are just generally pleasant people to be around.  That's it. That's all you need to get me in here.",

We decided to do the Family Feast- which is a four course tasting menu. We already loved Spanish food before eating at Morcilla but this experience has taken our love to a whole new level. Everything was precise, thoughtful, and absolutely delicious! We also discovered that we like oxtail! The oxtail montadito (part of the second course) were incredible! I highly recommend doing the Family Feast if it is your first time at Morcilla. It gives you a great introduction to the menu and lets you sample a lot. We will be back again soon to sample more of the menu!",

The queso, ribs, sausage and cabbage were all works of art. Masterfully paired sauces, etc all in perfect harmony. Two more cocktails that were perfect. Sealed with a delicious espresso and a creme brulee that was out of this world. Will go here EVERY time we are in the area. Was in town from Cleveland for a concert.   Ps- the details in this place are spectacular. The floor tile, the ceiling, the light fixtures, the bathroom sink and tile, and so much more.

Bacalao montadito, Marcona almonds with lavender salt, Serrano ham, warm bread with olive oil,, mesclun greens with strawberry vinaigrette and shall I go on! Each bite was truly delicious. Enjoyed the herbaceous sparkling sangria and the dramatically poured txacholina (rose and white, preferred white). The have 2 dessert; both great but the frozen creme catalan was the winner.

I had a best friend and her husband visiting from out of town, and I knew I had to do right by them food-wise, because they come from a city with hip and happening food scene and they always take me somewhere amazing when I visit them there.  Enter: Morcilla. I had been wanting to go there for ages, so it was a first time visit for all in the party.  We didn't linger over the menu for long before realizing that there was only one proper way to play it: go big with the Family Feast, or go home. Each course delighted us more than the last, with the star of the show being the big platter of arroz con pitu de caleya, a cider-braised chicken over rice. It blew my humble arroz con pollo out of the water, and let me tell you--I make a MEAN arroz con pollo. I drank it all in: the atmosphere, the food, the company, the service. It was all very special, and worth the wait to share it with a party that knows from good food. My only regret is that the four of us couldn't finish the chicken and rice, so we had it boxed up--and promptly forgot to take it home! (Wahhhh!) I'm definitely looking forward to a return visit someday.",

The service was superb, our waiter (Dave) was very friendly, he gave great recommendations and was super knowledgeable when it came to the menu. If you like gin and tonics, this place will not disappoint. Lots of options. Given that it is tapas style, we ordered 5 things (2 snacks, 1 charcuterie, and 2 small plates) and that was probably one thing too much for two people though obviously some things are different sizes. Their Brussels sprouts were excellent, the flavors were fantastic and fresh. The manchego was great. The chorizo was really different, a good different. The cod croquettes were breaded so lightly. The pork ribs melted off the bone. Overall, everything was cooked to perfection. The only thing I did not like was the  frozen creme brulee (Crema Catalana), it just was a little bland. That aside, this place was really great and it's definitely worth checking out.",

Make sure to go online to make a reservation.  We started with the beef crudo (tartare) and it was simply fantastic. Next up they brought out the cecina and warm bread and olive oil. The cecina was sweet and complimented nicely by the smoked shallot.   Next up was the octopus a la plancha. Wish I had octopus before so I had something to compare it to, but I can say it was decent. The meat was pretty tough (again, not sure if that is how good octopus is supposed to be) and it was served with an overwhelming amount of the sesame yogurt. I suggest eating the yogurt separately so you can enjoy the octopus more. The chickpeas that came with it were excellent as well.  Lastly, they brought out the castillas de mantanza which are the baby back pork ribs. Sweet and tangy, these were simply delicious. In addition, we enjoyed the morcilla sausage, which were soft and savory.   Cough up the money and come here to really enjoy some fine dining. We tossed the idea around of getting a large plate, but ultimately decided on doing a few of the small plates just so we can taste a lot more. Apparently the chef specializes in the charcuterie, so I would recommend getting one or two of those meats.",

You order two or three, taste enjoy and talk. Then you decide on what to order next. Drinks while you wait with more conversation. Repeat. This place made me feel rushed and obvious turn table strategy. We moved to the bar and had a much more enjoyable experience. We should have eaten at the bar. Maybe next time?",

    "text": "Wonderful \"Family Feast\". The flavor profiles are as good as you will find in Pittsburgh. The Oxtail Montadito was the standout, followed by the Beet Conserva, Charcuteria and Foie Blonde. Everything else was very good as well. Service was excellent. There was one misstep....the main course, Fideua de Mariscos, was served with about 25% of the clams and mussels unopened...4 clams and 2 mussels. Were they uncooked or bad???..who knows...and should it have left the kitchen that way? ?? No way. When advised, our server apologized and took those 6 back and returned with them opened. Just don't think things like that should happen.",

    "text": "I am regretful that I have no photos, but this is a place where you just naturally forget you have a phone and fully become present with your dinner mates and the food.   I had polled quite a few friends about restaurants they think are worth showing off to people who used to live in Pittsburgh and are back in town. Morcilla came up on everyone's list.   We made a reservation for a Saturday night and I'm glad we did as the place was packed all evening.   The atmosphere is very warm. Our server was a wealth of knowledge and helped us navigate appropriate quantities of food for our group. Her recommendations were on point and she paced the plates we ordered at the perfect pace and combinations of plates that we ordered was also perfect!   We did a number of small plates. The octopus was phenomenal. Incredibly tender and yet meaty! I couldn't get over it. The fried artichokes were great and the oxtail was one of the most flavorful foods I've ever eaten. The cecina was perhaps the most buttery,melt in your mouth cured meat I've ever tried.   I cannot adequately express what a pleasurable dining experience this was. We finished our meal with the churros and they came out piping hot-crispy and coated in sugar and slightly custardy in the center. Dip them in the not-too-sweet chocolate sauce for perfection.   I have to say, there are other things that impressed me. Our table was close to the kitchen and offered us a unique view. We could not get over how impeccably clean it looked! It was also relatively quiet! No screaming from the kitchen! In addition, despite the fact that the place was full, it didn't feel too noisy or that you're on top of other diners.   I'm still thinking of this meal and can't wait to go back and try the family style course option!",

    "text": "This Restaurant came highly recommended by local friends. I was dining by myself and decided to have four small rations like tapas, instead of a large meal. My waitress was very nice and helpful. The wine by the glass is limited and features wines from Galicia, Navarra, Alicante and Catalunya amongst others. There were a few legs of Jamon iberico hanging above the bar. I was getting excited. I was raised in Madrid and recently spent a couple of weeks in Madrid, toledo, sevilla, Granada, etc. I assume that this restaurant presents itself as a Spanish establishment. The group next to me was having a \"fideua de mariscos \" that looked and smelled great. But the \"small plate\" (read tapas) menu looked puzzling. Lots of bizarre combinations, kind of like if you let your ten year old cook and then start to add up things that really don't go together but they are having fun and in the end no one can eat it. The chef here could be an award winning pro with Michelin stars on his lapel. I don't know. And just because he chooses unlikely ingredients to create different gradations and pastel colors for your palate does not necessarily lead to a bad experience. That's the thing to do, right? I live in New York so maybe I am being unfair. I am not going to compare this place to la bernardin or \"per se\". Having said that, this place is not cheap and by Pittsburgh standards, these are new york prices. My first dish was a chorizo based meal with oil, Roquefort cheese and some pieces of dates in it. It was served cold and not even room temperature. The oil felt a little bit thick, didn't taste like olive oil to me and it dominated the experience. The cheese made me suffer a bit but I ate it. The rainbows and unicorns that are supposed to make your palate explode in extasis, were not simply there. I once was at a party with Paul Liebrand and he made a salad. When a chef makes something that makes you melt and you have no idea how to replicate that or how he did it, that's magic. This applies to the performing arts too. Cooking can be like painting, sculpting or playing bach partitas on a strad... I ate the chorizo because it was brought to me and I was hungry. That's all. I was drinking a glass of garnacha blanca. Next was the \"pulpo a la plancha\"... The octopus was overcooked, chewy. Not a very generous portion. Maybe the purveyors come on Tuesday? This was a Friday. I guess I expected something like an homage to \"pulpo a la gallega\". Far from it. Underneath there was something that felt like mashed potatoes and I don't remember seeing any pimenton. But the place is dark. Again, no magic. I ate it, like someone who is forced to eat a meal at their aunt's home. It was a $16 appetizer after all. Next, I ordered a glass of red. I actually don't remember now, it wasn't memorable. I think it was a rioja. With the red, I procede with the ribs. Now, where do I begin. They were tender, yet dry and flaky. Also, they were sweet, as if they were going for some momofuku inspired Korean thing. But it wasn't even that sweet. There was basically no flavor and this one really disappointed. I am no expert but I can make amazing short rib and ribs with my instant pot. I didn't attend CIA. The last dish was the signature offer from the house, I'm assuming, because it was the \"morcilla\". It was actually brought in as the fourth course even though I asked for it as a third. But why not? Grand finale, right? Back up the truck! . Small portion, and dry. I felt like I was eating Styrofoam.  For a place that makes pretty oily dishes, this Morcilla (blood sausage) was not moist. Again, served with an amalgam of ingredients that neither my vision or palate could recognize. So, final thoughts : this place, under some kind of a Spanish heritage guise, fails to capture the essence of the flavors of Spain. I applaud the valor of the chef to be adventurous and, using avant guard ideas in the preparation of unique is always welcome. I once ate at a high end Italian in Tokyo. Everything looked and felt like Japanese traditional food. Yet, my mouth was convincing me that I was eating great Italian dishes, one after the other. By no means, in spite of my opinion, I am telling you not to visit \"Morcilla\". Everyone has a bad day. Maybe it was one of those. Furthermore, the group next to me, was having fun and they kept telling the waiter how glorious the \"fideua\" was and how everything was prepared to perfection. Perhaps this is the way to go. Pittsburgh needs more places like this and I am impressed with the growth in the high end restaurant scene. I saw a nice feature on youtube about why pgh is the hottest place to eat and, \"morcilla\" was featured. Not so fast. At least if you visit this place, avoid the \"tapas\" (they don't call them that, oddly enough). And kudos to the servers, waiters and staff.",

    "text": "So I hesitated a bit with the rating of this review, partly because I can't but help compare it to Cure where every bite was a feast for the senses, and for me Morcilla had some great food and just really fantastic service, but it didn't quite reach Cure's level and I'm struggling to put into words why.   It was a group of 7 of us and we ordered a fair bit of food including the Charcuterie sampler platter, the suckling pig, the tuna tartare, potatoes bravas, blood sausage with acorn relish, sous vide Octopus and a jug of sangria.   I don't know if there was someone on the table who was a food hog, or if the pieces were miscounted, but by the time the platter got to me, and I was the second last person to be served, a lot of the meat only had x 1 piece left and the person served after me definitely missed out on some of the Charcuterie! Btw, what I tasted of this platter was great - really perfectly curated.   I really liked the rest of our menu choices too - we had some fussy eaters who ended up loving the blood sausage to their surprise and our table had a lovely conversation then about haggis vs blood pudding and white pudding. I loved the acorn relish and licked the plate clean with a piece of bread- I wasn't letting any of that food item go to waste!    The octopus was another favorite as was the lavendar sugared marcona almonds. The suckling pig's skin was so crisp, and the flavors were perfectly spot on and tender. The tuna tartare was another favorite and frankly, you can never go wrong with an order of Potatoes Bravas at a Spanish restaurant and this was no exception.  For dessert we tried 2 of the 3 available choices - I'm not a fan of sabayon and after I described to my colleagues how it was made, there was unanimous agreement to instead try the Creme Catalina plus the Churros. To my surprise, I really liked the Churros - the cinnamon dusting on it wasn't at all aggressive but the Creme Catalina is what I would order again next time and then not share!  Really lovely evening out but if it came back to a choice, I'd go back to Cure before coming back to Morcilla!  PS - it was only after I uploaded pics that I realized my review failed to mention the cauliflower and mushroom with egg dish! Guess they weren't that memorable even tho' I recall liking the mushrooms!  Yelp Review 58/2017",

Because i am Basque from Bilbao, I feel compelled to say that pintxos are not just a fancy word for tapas, they are a style of cooking from northern Spain. While the flavors are creative and interesting, the menu is not very authentic and the portions are insufficient and overpriced. I even had to ask for bread, a staple at the Spanish dinner table, to accompany my cheese, aceitunas, and jamon --- and I was charged for it. I was particularly looking forward to your flagship food, morcilla. A very small sausage link was served, doused in sauce. While the sauce was flavorful, the flavors of the tiny morcilla were drowned out. A good restaurant overall, but definitely room for improvement.",

I also had a glass of their homemade sangria with red wine and didn't like it. Something in there was REALLY strong. I'm not a drinker at all(I expect a glass of sangria to be sweet and fruity.).

    "text": "If I had to describe Morcilla in one word it would be \"underwhelming.\" It's probably my fault for having such high expectations, but I was generally disappointed with it and will probably not be back. I love tapas more than any kind of food, but was not overly impressed with anything at Morcilla besides the dessert. I'm not confused about what to expect at a tapas place, but everything we ordered was unusually small and overly expensive. I was continually sad to see such small portions and high prices. Most of the food was good, but it wasn't mind blowing. The servers were also very attentive with filling our water, but lacked charisma and did not improve the experience.   While dining at Morcilla our table ordered: 1. Serrano ham- table mates liked it but described it like \"regular prosciutto\"  2. Poquillo rellenos de bacalao- was tasty but disappointingly small. If I had to describe it in layman's terms: small piece of toast with potato and a pepper on top. We ate it in four tiny forkfuls.  3. Churro de cangrejo y estagon- apparently really popular crab and tarragon churro but nothing special. I was not impressed with the flavor or grease and mayo (aioli) combo.  4. Queso de cambra- delicious, but $6 for three small cheese croquettes. If we had ordered four of these plates I would have been satisfied. If there had been at least two more on the plate I would have been less annoyed. 5. Mushroom plate- flavorful and unique  6. Bacalao- very interesting and innovative, but also tiny and $14.  7. Canelone crepe- enjoyed by my table mates. I don't eat duck so I couldn't really tell you.   The best part of the meal was the creme brulee type desert we ordered. It was phenomenal. If everything else we ate had been similar to the desert, I would be rating Morcilla 5 stars.  I can honestly say I've never been so confused about a restaurant's Yelp rating as I am with Morcilla. I feel like it should be rated 3 stars and if I could give half stars I'd be giving it a 2.5 right now. I'm kind of confused in the way people have jumped on the Morcilla bandwagon. Maybe it's because I don't eat enough meat, and their impressive dishes are meat based? Or maybe I wasn't invited when everyone decided to drink the Kool-Aid.",

When we arrived we were seated immediately and the service was prompt and friendly.  I love the cozy feel of the restaurant and the cured meat hanging over the bar, as well as the open windows in the front of the restaurant.  The back of the restaurant is a little dark but cozy with a nice ambiance.  We started with the large charcuterie platter that had samples of all the meats.  It was a perfect size for 3 people, but a little pricey for $50.  The meats were all excellent but I wish it had some cheese options to accompany it too.  We tried several of the tapas as well and my favorite was the wild mushrooms with the raw egg that you mix together.  That was fantastic!  Everything was very good, but I felt the prices were rather high for the size of the portions.  For example, I ordered one of the shrimp tapas and it only came with one shrimp :(  It was a large shrimp but still.  Tapas are usually meant to be shared and that is hard to do with one shrimp.  We also sampled some of the cocktails and those were excellent and at typical Pittsburgh high end cocktail prices.  They have a focus on gins which nice for a change, since it seems like every other place in Pittsburgh is focusing on Whiskeys and Bourbons now.",

Unfortunately, we still left hungry and our bill was almost $200. Definitely not filling by any means, but was a great spot for a boozy lunch.",

Other than that, it was a great dinner and experience. I would definitely recommend it!",

    "text": "This place is ahmazing!! From start to finish everything was delicious! For the first 2 courses, we had the oxtail montadito, foie blonde, chicharron, octopus, and tomato salad to start. The stars were the oxtail, octopus and tomato salad. The oxtail came with 2 pieces - deliciously spiced chunks atop toasted baguette with melted mahon cheese. The octopus starter could have been more generous - but maybe that's just because i wanted more more more!! The tomato salad was scrumptious as well - the whipped feta and harissa really kicked up the lightness of the tomatoes! The other 2 starters weren't quite as exciting: the foie blonde was disappointing - it tasted like strawberry cereal in french toast, which didn't highlight the richness of the pate. The chicharrons were also nothing to really write home about.   For a main entree we got the 16oz new york strip steak. It was AWESOME and came with the setas a la plancha (the oyster mushrooms with shallots). There was a scrumptious balsamic/red wine-like reduction glaze that complemented the steak perfectly! To finish, we got the crema catalana and man oh man we were not disappointed! It was essentially a frozen version of creme brulee but somehow tasted even better than the classic!! The custard had more of a ice cream/frozen custard-y richness which was perfectly balanced by the crisp sugar crust on top. YUM.   Highly recommend for a celebratory dinner, anniversary, or date night!",

I was excited about the trip here, partially because my wife and I would probably not go here on our own and it was our friend's pick. The inside has a nice modern look. We were seated quickly upon arriving and my wife and I decided to split some small plates throughout the evening.  We ended up splitting the oxtail, beef tartare, tomato and peach salad, ribs, and beets. The beets were one of my favorite and had a 1:1 ratio of goat cheese and the maple drizzle on top added a nice sweetness. The beef tartare is a huge portion. Oxtail was decent. I would very much recommend the ribs. They had a pomegranate sherry caramel glaze which added sweetness and was an excellent balance of savory and sweet.  The reason this is a 4 star for me and not a 5 is that the time between our last two dishes was around an hour. Other than that the food, atmosphere, and uniqueness of the dishes were great! I would recommend coming here to try some good food that you do not find in other restaurants around the city.",

    "text": "I stopped by here a couple of Thursday's ago with my wife and another couple for dinner.  This was actually my second visit to Morcilla and the one thing that I remembered from the first visit besides the food was that the number of workers/tables was quite impressive.  That held True for this visit as well.  Whenever you enter Morcilla there is a bar on the right and then the dining room is straight ahead of you and the kitchen is behind that.  We ended up getting seated in the dining room and the only distinguishing feature that I really noticed inside was that they had hams (real or fake?) hanging up above the bar area.  I would recommend reservations as both times that I have been here it has been packed.    For dinner on this evening my wife and I decided to split a number of items from the snacks portion or the menu as well as one of the larger plates that served 2-4 people.  From the snacks portion we ordered the queso en aceite, beer battered summer beans and croquetas de bacalao and then from the larger plates we ordered the fideua de mariscos.  The menu describes the queso as manchego, meyer lemon, padron peppers, olive oil, roasted garlic, toast while it describes the beans as coming with aioli and burnt lemon and finally the croquettes as salt cod, burnt lemon, espelette honey.  All of these items came out at random times intermixed with items that the other couple had ordered as well.  They were all quite good and I think my favorite was the queso with manchego.  The reason for this was that I loved the sauce on top and beneath the cheese.  As a matter of a fact, once we had finished with the cheese I used the toasted points from another dish to eat a little more of it.  Then the beans were my second favorite as they had a nice crunch to them and the aioli provided the perfect dipping sauce.  My least favorite was the croquettes which were still quite good but not at the level of the other two.  After we had finished with all of our snacks and small plates we then proceeded to wait 30+ minutes before our fideua de mariscos was brought out.  This was weird because by the time it was brought out, it had been over an hour since we had ordered.  In any case, the menu describes the fideua as  lobster broth, calamari, clams, PEI mussels and that it is recommended for 2-4 people.  Whenever it came out I can't say that it looked exactly how I expected it  to as with the lobster broth being mentioned I expected it to be a soup like dish (think a bouillabaisse) and it ended up being more of a pasta dish. That doesn't mean that it wasn't good as all of the shellfish was cooked perfectly as was the calamari which we all know is a tough thing.  The flavors were good as well and the pasta that was underneath all the shellfish helped to make it a more filling dish although I can't say that I was full after everything I ate, not that I was hungry either.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably head back here again in the future.  All of the food that we had was fantastic and I only wish that we didn't have to wait so long in between some of the \"courses\".",

The cocktails are all very good but Morcilla prides themselves on their house made tonics used in a build your own gin and tonic. You choose from a variety of top shelf gins and one of two house made tonics (herbal or more citrus options).   Olives fall right off the pit and are perfect with wine and the queso appetizer. The queso is prepared in a house oil with sweet peppers and crackers. For dinner I would highly recommend the steak - but I would only split with one other person. The red wine sauce has an almost sweet/balsamic taste to it and the steak is perfectly crusted and cooked to perfection.",

I recommend reservations as we had reservations for 2 at 630 on a Monday and they were very busy. We were still served quickly despite how busy they were. Our server was so nice. When I told her I was pescatarian, she marked up my menu so I knew exactly what I could order.   The Brussel sprouts snack was amazing! Shaved Brussels, feta, pomegranate with a sherry dressing. So flavorful and I only wish there was more! The warm bread snack with herbed oil was good but I think other snacks are more worth it.   For small plates we went with the croquettes and fried sunchokes, both highly recommended by me. My husband thought the croquettes were a little bland for him but they're served with a honey dipping sauce and I enjoyed it. We shared the trout large place which was so buttery and delicious! We ate every piece! For dessert, you can't go wrong with the churros and chocolate hazelnut dipping sauce. Everything was so fresh and served hot, you could tell nothing sat in the kitchen.   Husband and I shared 2 snacks, 2 small plates, 1 large plate and dessert. It was the perfect amount of food for us.   Husband also had a cocktail and espresso. Total about $110 and worth every cent! If you like tapas, you've got to try Morcilla! Can't wait to come back!",

Tonight was our lucky night out where we got to indulge a little.  I'm happy to report that we can't wait to go back.  Since this was our first trip to Morcilla, we opted for the Family Feast which allowed us to sample a wide variety of the menu.  Our favorites were: OXTAIL MONTADITO, FOIE BLONDE, SPANISH MACKEREL ESCABECH, and BEET CONSERVA.  I could eat that beet conserva every day of the week!  The creamy cheese mixed with the earthy beets... That's my idea of happiness.  Honestly everything was delicious!    I also want to give a shout out ton the service staff at Morcilla.  They ran that restaurant like a well oiled machine.  Whether they were bringing out food, refilling drinks, or wiping crumbs off the table, they were on top of it.  I was really impressed!  I cannot wait to go back to Morcilla and try the other delicious items on the menu.  It's not every day when your entire experience is phenomenal, but that's what we experienced at Morcilla.",

The frozen crema was a frozen creme brulee- a delicious twist on an already delicious meal!  I suggest getting the side of bread as it was great to dip into the extra sauce from our dishes! The scallops were cooked well - about 5-6 slices come in a small plate. The bite was 2 pieces so know that they are just a bite so get a few! Cappuccino was delicious - came with a nice sugar cube - recommend putting in in the cup. Great wait staff and very nice. There is no outdoor seating but you can sit by the window at the bar. Dress is nice casual to classy. Went on a Sunday evening and not too crowded, had a reservation at 4:45pm and stayed until 6:45pm, I would say leave at least an hour - hour and a half to enjoy the dining experience.",

    "text": "As a newbie to the entire Pittsburgh area and dining scene, I was very impressed with this Spanish tapas specialist. We were visiting from NJ this weekend and were taken here by our foodie cousins who were very excited to share this place with us.   We arrived about 10 minutes late on Saturday night but no problem here. It was somewhat crowded but we were seated promptly. The waitress was so welcoming and ran through the style of food flawlessly and with enthusiasm. She made some pointed recommendations and was especially helpful when we told her that the majority of us are pescatarians. No problem... she guided us accordingly.   We started with the matrimonio and marcona almonds. Wow! The bread with anchovies was really tasty and the almonds were surprising since the seasoning had a strong punch of sugar. If you don't mind starting off a bit sweet I think these are a hit. But if you're a bit more savory minded like me, maybe just stick with the matrimonio.   They gave us additional bread which I initially thought was unnecessary. Boy was I wrong. Great to sop up all of the different flavors as each plate came out.  We snacked on fried artichokes and octopus which were both spectacular. We opted for the pimento cheese snack which I admit felt like a gamble but was quite good. The beets and smoky goat cheese was out of this world.   The main plate was a trout which was served whole but the main fish was filleted to perfection. The tomatoes and unctuous sauce were to die for, fresh and herbaceous. Really lovely. The zucchini a la plancha was also a nice small plate. Hazelnuts galore!   We were quite stuffed but we wanted to try the churros. Our server was convinced we needed another sweet bite and gave us a complementary peach sorbet in addition. She recommended a dry sherry for the guys to sip on with dessert. Everyone was pleased.   The service is so caring. Each course delivered so flawlessly but without any stuffiness and the bus boys came around and cleaned the table multiple times. It was a great dining experience in a pretty trendy but laid back way!   Would definitely recommend this place. Apparently the restauranteur is opening another local spot very soon. Run don't walk to Morcilla. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Great Spanish tapas restaurant - they have appetizers, small plates, and large plates ideal for sharing with multiple people. Came here with one other person and we shared a large plate and 3 small ones and were stuffed by the end with no room for dessert.  First of all, ordered a small 4oz Trabanco cider. Perfect amount for me - a tart and slightly bitter cider that I would recommend trying.  For me, the octopus was the highlight of the entire meal. You MUST try this! It was beautifully cooked and had some crispy edges on top of a warm sesame yogurt and balanced by cucumber, dill, and chickpeas. A wonderful combination.   The oxtail was another fantastic dish. It comes with 2 pieces so great to share with just one other person. The oxtail sits on a piece of baguette with a layer of cheese on top. Rich and delicious!  The creamed corn was personally not for me - not a bad dish at all but I felt that the cream overpowered the taste of the corn and other toppings and was overall a little too heavy for my taste.   For our main, we ordered the steak (bisteca a la plancha). The steak was more on the rare side of medium rare (which I had no issue with) but is something to note if you like your steak a little less pink. Very well cooked meat (the sauce was a little too overpowering for my taste) and the fork smashed potatoes and roasted shallots on the side were perfect.   Overall I think this is a great spot for date night or a nice group dinner. Very intimate setting and they have some great snack and charcuterie options I wasn't able to try as well. I'm definitely going to be back!",

This place is great for anyone who enjoys trying out several things on the menu as their food is meant to be shared, offering a selection of snack sized, small, and large portioned tapas. We went with the warm crisp bread served with olive oil dipping sauce, croquettes filled with salted cod and honey dipping sauce (the contrast of flavors between the sour lemon garnish, warm croquette, and sweet honey was a divine combination), the scallop curdo bathed in a salsa verde sauce, and finally the trout, served as an entire whole fish, simple yet full of flavor. To top it all off, we shared the Crema Catalina, their take on the traditional French Creme Brulee dessert, which while similar in flavor, offers a unique contrast with warm burnt sugar top coating over a cold bed of custard.",

The plates are pretty small especially if you are sharing with two people so if you are stopping in for dinner the bill can get large pretty quickly.   Another thing to note was that when being seated the restaurant was empty all but for one table. The host tried to seat us right next to the other table. We politely asked to sit at the bar instead so that we were awkwardly overhearing the only other table in the restaurant's conversation.   That being said, everything we tasted was great and would definitely go back to try more. It just might be a spot that we hit before a dinner somewhere else.   Our bartender was very friendly and had great suggestions for us.",

He knew what beer my husband was drinking when he asked if he needed another. Loved the way he was so  knowledgeable. The food was delicious, nothing was a disappointment. I'm giving four stars because I wished the restaurant was a bit brighter so that we could see the delicious foods served. It didn't help to bring out the different food colors. The lovely seafood noodle like dish served on a paella dish to be dharedis simply mouth watering. The stock they used for the dish is divine. Loved the Morcilla sausage and the fried croquette like snack! Drinks are very good too. Will definitely go back in a heart beat!",

When you first walk in, you feel like you walked into some rustic European restaurant. It's beautiful. Cured meat is hanging over the bar. Drinks are strong and good (got the sangria!)  The 4 of us split 8-10 small plates / apps as the entrees apparently take 1-2 hours. We saw one of the large ones and it was gigantic, easily could've fed 4 people alone without any other dishes.   The standouts were the beets conserve with goat cheese, oxtail, and oyster mushrooms with egg yolk. The charcuterie was amazing. Ribs, asparagus, and croquettes were ok. A little dried out. The octopus was good but very very small. Overall, the portions are very very small. We ended the meal with churros and it was delicious.  Service is outstanding, FYI. Bravo, Morcilla!",

First , Spanish food does not consist of cooking them and serving them with cream sauce, they are usually cooked with olive oil and garlic. Second, the place was so small you were practically on top of each other, forget having an intimate date there, this is not the place for you. Third , if the food wasn't impressive enough, we were being served by the snootiest waitress which I think was the worst . If you can't be warm and inviting, don't work in this field , right there you just destroyed my dining experience. I will not be coming back and I will never recommend this place to anyone who asks me.",

    "text": "Torn between 3 and 4 stars but leaning towards 3. Dishes were a mix of a hits and misses for me. But I guess that's the fun of tapas!?  A group of friends and I (6 people total) had a reservation here. First off, we arrived around 5 minutes early but were made to wait for our table to be ready until around 10 minutes after our reservation time. This is disappointing for a higher priced restaurant.  We were hungry and it would have taken a while to consolidate our order choices, so we decided to go for the \"Family Feast\" for our table. This is a 4 course set dinner (more than 4 dishes) for the entire table, $45/person. The waitress explained that this was a good choice for people who were dining at Morcilla for the first time and want the Morcilla experience. The amount of food and dishes was perfect, but I would definitely choose what to order myself if I were to do it again.  Here's a quick rundown of what was memorable, going off the list on their website.  Snacks (warm bread, almonds, olives): Highlight were the lavender flavored nuts. I'm pretty sure we got nuts that weren't almonds, but I don't remember exactly what. They give a lot of olives so you can keep munching on them throughout the meal.  Charcuterie: I was so excited for the cured meats here, and they let me down. The lomo slices came with kumquat preserves on top. The kumquats were extremely sweet and overwhelming, and the syrup got on all the slices of the meat. The kumquats were nice, but I felt like I couldn't enjoy or taste the lomo. Chorizo was in a pool of oil. Wouldn't choose to order it again.  Croquetas de bacalao: These were pretty good, would recommend as a small dish.  Arroz con pitu de caleya: Basically rice with chicken. The chicken was extremely soft. A crowdpleaser, but not a very exciting dish.  Champinones a la plancha: My favorite dish of the night! That oyster mushroom mixture with the egg was sooo good!  Churros with chocolate hazelnut fondue: Tastes just like it sounds. Chocolate sauce isn't too sweet which is nice.  For drinks, I ordered a pitcher of the Sangria Espumosa. Our table agreed that we probably would have enjoyed either the red of white wine sangrias more.",

The ambience is intimate yet lively. The waiters are knowledgeable and friendly, but not intrusive. We ordered about 9 tapas- 6 smaller bites and 3 plates. It was the perfect amount of food. We left satisfied but not stuffed. All of the tapas were very good- standouts were  the chorizo pintox, beef tartare montadito, and  pig feet and cheeks croqueta.   I give this place 4 not 5 stars because some of the tapas, while good, fell a little short- particularly the artichoke and the butter lettuce salad. Don't get me wrong, my husband and I cleaned our plates, but in comparison to some of the other tapas these just weren't as good or interesting.   Overall, I was very pleased with my meal and I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Stopped in last night with a group of 4 for dinner, and it was a fantastic experience!   For a group of 4 we had reservations at 8 and were seated right away, A little after ordering drinks, my friend and I realized we were sitting right under an AC vent and it was a little chilly. The staff was super accommodating in allowing us to switch tables and keep our server, who was awesome by the way!  Cocktails were delightful! I started with the Palabra Amarilla, a mezcal & chartreuse drink that was much easier to drink than it sounds. Major points to the bartenders behind the cocktail program because we were continually satisfied. The Old Havana, with a smoked ice cube, was another awesome cocktail. The Vermut con Refresco was another group favorite, sweet vermouth + gin and saffron. Dangerously good.  We started with the \"All of the Meats\" platter of charcuterie, which some might say is a little steep at $60, but for the amount of awesome meats you get and the variety presented, it's definitely well worth it.   The meal itself is more tapas-style, so we ordered around 2-3 plates per person. We were blown away by the dishes as well! To start, the manchego cheese dressed with olive oil & served with the baguettes was incredible. The flavor packed into the little cheese bites (and the charcuterie) was just priming us for the rest of a delightful meal to follow.   Of the tapas, our group's favorites included: octopus a la plancha, brandade de bacalao, arctic char a la plancha, morcilla sausage, napa cabbage a la plancha, & pork belly and peaches a la plancha. Every dish was composed E X P E R T L Y. The octopus was cooked perfectly, tender and snapped into nice, not chewy bites. The bacalao has a saltiness that lended it well to spreading across the crostinis that were given. Arctic char's cherry tomato sauce & sweet garlic complemented each other beautifully, and the sprouts on top only elevated the dish. The sausage was phenomenally crafted, as the entire dish truly complemented itself. Between the braised greens, toasted nuts, fresh cilantro, and the flavors in the sausage itself, it was wildly good.   We finished by ordering all three desserts featured, the churros, crema catalana (like creme brulee), and the peach sorbet. If you don't have the kind of appetite we did, definitely get the churros! They're nice and hot, with a chocolate hazelnut sauce, and it's great way to finish up your meal.  Big shout-out to our server Dave! He was super attentive and on top of everything we needed! Don't be fooled if your server appears to be somewhat casually dressed, because their service is anything but. He was on top of coursing our meal out for us, and clearing the table and also cleaning between courses, and always did so with a friendly and efficient manner. We never felt that we were waiting long for a single thing, it was a service experience I'll definitely remember! Even when we were having desserts and my friend dropped his fork, he had a clean one before he even had a chance to pick up the other off the ground. That's how great our service was!  Morcilla is on top of everything. Definitely stop in if you haven't done so already. We will certainly be back (I made a yelp account just so I could tell them how great they are)",

The food is inventive and tasty; the ambiance is convivial (or, if we take a less charitable spin, very LOUD); the prices are high, but the young hip professional-looking customers don't seem to care.  We ordered a range of dishes, shared family style, at the wise suggestion of our server. On the whole, the portions are probably smaller than the menu category would have suggested (in particular, something under \"plates\" is actually more appetizer sized). We shared: oysters with pickled grapes and mustard seeds (surprisingly refreshing!), ham croquettes (fine, but probably the least impressive of the things we got), a leek and potato stew (NB: chorizo is spicy!), octopus (good complementary sauce), duck leg (absolutely delicious!), and baby back ribs (also very delicious and tender). This was for three people. It may sound like a lot of food, but most dishes, other than the ribs, were really just a few bites (though I think a few bites is exactly the right portion). Good desserts too.  I had a lot of fun, even though it's hard to hold a conversation without resorting to shouting. I'd definitely go back.",

    "text": "We had a great first experience at Morcilla! I was anxiously awaiting our date night reservation, but there were some empty tables on a Sunday evening so you may be able to get in without one. I eat seafood but not meat (fiance does but he doesn't eat cheese); we still found plenty to try. Between the two of us, we had a carafe of wine, one pinxto, one montadito, three plates, and dessert. I felt like this was plenty and left full. The price points are a good guide to the size of the dish, but even the small plates were rich. I appreciated having fair priced house wine because I expected that would be pricier (I think it was $17 for a carafe giving about 2 glasses each). Here's what we tried:  Bacalao en aceite--I really liked this, it came with three crostini and a bowl with several pieces of fish. Overall very delicious, I liked the caper and fried garlic accents.   Morcilla sausage--I didn't eat this, but my fiance was very happy with it.  Churro de cangrejo y estragon--This was actually the one thing we found a little disappointing. I saw a lot of people raved about this on here, but it seemed light on the crab. It mostly tasted like fried dough with a cheese sauce. I still liked it, but it didn't meet expectations.      Pulpo Escabeche--Soooo good! I had never tried octopus but was feeling adventurous, and I'm so happy I went for it. The potato and sauce complemented it perfectly. I can't wait to come back and have this again!  Champinones a la plancha--If you like mushrooms, you will enjoy this. They had a nice hearty flavor.   Churros--Obvious choice for dessert, delicious chocolate sauce. They did seem a little underdone in the middle, but it didn't bother me.   The service was wonderful, very professional but not overbearing. My water was always refilled and empty plates were cleared promptly. It's a casual atmosphere (many diners were wearing shorts) yet refined food and service. The pace of the meal was also well timed. Our two smaller dishes came out very quickly, which worried me it might go too fast, but the rest of the courses had appropriate breaks in between. Yes, it is a pricier night out, but it's a unique Pittsburgh dining experience and well worth it in my opinion. I'm looking forward to returning!",

Our server was fantastic as well and I wish I could remember her name but we were there on Sunday Aug 20th so tell her thank you from the couple from California who were the last to leave, and to Dave or David?  who stopped us on the street the next day and shook our hand because he recognized us from the night before. We're in the rest buis so I can attest this place rules!",

I will say that, this time, we sat near the kitchen in the back corner, which was super exciting for an amateur foodie chef like me. Also, even though Open Table said Morcilla was booked, we called and got a late night table. And, again, we ate all-of-the-things and had dessert and had a bottle of wine - and our bill was more than reasonable. Morcilla should be on the top of everyone's list for date night - or ANY night!",

Once I was inside, was love at first sight: the counter with some pintxos, the tapas menu written as the Spanish way and, most important, see those ham legs hanging up at the counter area was such a familiar feeling... He nailed it!!! AMAZING, these tapas with a Severino's twist were soooo special. The best one for me?? The oxtail montadito was one of the best I have ever taste in my life ( and as a Spanish girl I've tasted many tapas in my life). And the croquetas, specially the bacalao (cod) one was incredible!! The way he prepared the cured meat...awesome, as usual. Of course, there were other ones that weren't so special for me and I have told him too, as a constructive comment (sorry if I bothered you with my suggestions, Justin Severino). This is a great place to discover, definitely. Congrats to this brave chef and his team and all the best for them. They really deserve it!",

Had a 3 course meal: Mojama for appetizer, Lengue De Res for meal and tried both dessert that was on the menu, Churros and Crema Catalana. Mojama would be probably better with some wine, doesn't have any fish taste to it, you can mostly just taste the pine nuts and chili oil, not spicey. The Baguette is warm and it mostly tasted like roster red pepper, I really enjoyed it. From the desserts I would favor the cream burley vs the donut sticks with dark chocolate fondue. My only issue is that when I left I was still hungry. I guess my meal just wasn't very filling. Love the atmosphere of the place though.",

It is impossible to go to a restaurant, order 8 menu items, and have every single one be perfection. That is what you get at Morcilla. Impeccable. In two trips, everything has been fantastic and consistent.   My only nit is that the second time I went with a friend and the waiter acted like she wasn't at the table.  The waiter spoke only to me. This did not happen when I was here last Friday, so I hope it was a fluke.   Be adventurous. Try everything, share everything.  You will not be disappointed.",

We had multiple servers, and despite the restaurant being full we never felt like we were waiting too long or that they were pestering us.   The food was all incredible. Very rarely does my family go to a restaurant where everyone loves every single dish. As it's a tapas style restaurant, the plates are small but we loved tasting so many things and we also didn't feel so uncomfortably full at the end.   Get the pork confit, don't even question it. Incredible flavor and the pork was so tender, it was also a good size for a main dish. Don't expect large portions. We also ordered the crab churros, lomo, goat cheese croquettas, morcilla montaditos, leek potato chorizo stew, lamb meatballs, duck crepe, and the chocolate and churros for dessert of course. We loved every single thing, each dish had unique flavors and every plate came out hot and obviously fresh. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I was super excited to go. So many people told me this was an amazing place that I was very excited to go and give a try.  So, if I understand correctly, this is a Spanish restaurant. Having visited Spain on many occasions, I am expecting to have a convivial environment, a good slow-priced food in small portions. What we basically call \"tapas\". I am expecting to have good house wine and Sangria.  So, I came, ordered the Patatas Bravas, which is the basic tapas. I ordered the lomo, another basic. And I ordered another dish that consists on a spread on a toast. There is an obvious effort to make the food nice. But the portion are ridiculously small (a toast is the size of a cracker - no kidding!) and the effort to make the food tasty ends up in an overdose of salt. After that, I ordered the salad and the lamb meatballs. Same thing: really small portions and too much salt.  With four glasses of house wine (you have to eat the Spanish way, right?), the check was $72 ... and I was still hungry after that.  Spanish food is basic, good, cheap, accessible. Morcilla fails at all of this. Morcilla falls in the same trap than almost all french restaurant in the USA: they are trying to overdo things and just do not respect the basics.  A real disappointment to me.",

Came here for a dinner with coworkers and ordered probably half the menu. I loved everything and I highly recommend their oxtail, pork cheek croquettes, Padron peppers,  and tuna crudo. I didn't think their dessert could do any better but their crema is probably the best I've ever had. It's basically a frozen creme brulee but it was warm on the outside and cold on the inside.

There were no albondigas, steak paillard, empanadas, figs & bacon with a reduction balsamic sauce, goat cheese and mushrooms. The list can go on of menu items they are missing. I've definitely had MUCH better!  Note to host staff - it's really pronounced Mor-thee-ya rather than Mor-see-ya.",

Really, the flavor palates could not have been more divergent, especially the sopa and garbonzo dish (which was reminiscent of N African). But all of it was fabulous. Her sopa was perhaps the best fish stew I've ever had.  It was better than my choice, but I'd definitely get all of it again.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I am from Spain so my standards might be higher than normal but I still feel it fell way short for a Spanish restaurant. Both on food and drinks. We ordered the tomato bread and only 1 slice of bread came out. Only 1 slice. Really??? It is bread and tomato. And you only bring out 1 piece of bread? For that price? The ham croquettes so stale and tiny we had to ask them to please substitute them (which they did at no charge, so that was good). We suggested to go with the Spanish omelette instead and was advice to go with something else as their version would not be what a Spaniard knew as such. Ok? We went with a montadito which again, for 2 people, came just as 1 piece of bread montadito. It was good but the amount was so cheap. For drinks we ordered a Hendricks gintonic. Hendricks was nowhere to be found and we ended up leaving half of our drink as was pure soda. They also used what seemed to be black pepper vs pink pepper so the taste was overwhelming. Considering Barcelona is the new gintonic capital of the World it fell massively short for a True Spanish experience. Pros: service was excellent and the restaurant is very nice.",

The Chorizo was perfect, a counter to the date and \"blue cheese\" as well as the serrano ham being a perfect funk balance to the almonds. The octopus was beyond tender with an enough snap to break the texture and finally the 18oz steak was to die for. Lain over a bed of smashed potatoes with caramelized shallot and it was one of the best pieces of meat you could get in the city. Last (and for all) the Crema Calatalana desert was a perfect way to end the night here. Our sever, Clara, really made our experience here beyond amazing. She was friendly, down to earth, and willing to answer any questions that we had, as well as give excellent recommendations. This is a highly sought after gem of Pittsburgh in my book and I recommend it to anyone.",

    "text": "5 stars.  This is the best restaurant in Pittsburgh, in my humble opinion.  *Disclaimer*  I studied Spanish in college, have been to Spain twice, and likely have a nostalgia for that culture and food that really hits me in the feels.  Regardless, I was recently at a tapas bar/restaurant in DC that didn't even come close to Morcilla.  Where to start?  The beauty of a tapas style restaurant is that the portions are small and offer a perfect couple of bites between two people, so you can really start anywhere and circle around the menu to your heart's content.  Although if you had to ask me, I'd say you should start at the oxtail and blood sausage.  After you've kick started your senses, meander around to the restaurant's take on Spanish tortilla and choose some sort of oily fish to cleanse your palate.  Finally, bask in all the glory of Espana and savor some jamon Iberico along with a sherry (or several).  I'll be at the bar, and you can buy me a drink for detailing the best way to eat, at the best restaurant in Pittsburgh.",

    "text": "Wow. Wow. Wow.  I made sure to hold off on writing this review so it would be my 600th. Obviously, that doesn't mean anything, but it just made writing this review that much more special for me. I love dining out not only in Pittsburgh but all over the country and world, and after much thought, I have named this restaurant my \"favorite restaurant of all time.\"  The hubby and I dined here with two fellow foodies and good friends in mid-February. The experience was exceptional from beginning to end. The restaurant is intimate, but the tables are still well spaced, not too crowded. Our waitress was attentive and made great recommendations. And the food - the food!! Our check was around $400, and considering the quality of our food and our overall experience, we happily paid the tab.  We ordered (and devoured): Bacalao en Aceite Surryano Ham Queso en Aceite Oxtail Queso de Cabra Basque Butter Lettuce Salad Pulpo Cochinillo (recommended for 2)  My personal favorites were the Oxtail, Pulpo, and Cochnillo. The bite of Oxtail - though petite - packed so much flavor that it was quite memorable. The Pulpo (aka octopus) was simple but very well cooked. Finally, trying the Cochnillo was just purely a lot of fun. The \"recommended for 2\" serving was on the menu when we dined - I see the \"recommended for 4\" listed a lot now - but it was plenty for the four of us to share along with everything else we ordered. The pig was just delicious, and I had never consumed anything quite like it.  In addition to the food, we enjoyed a bottle (or was it two?) of wine, and I also had the Park Guell. With \"sparkling rosado\" in the title, I was concerned that the cocktail would be too sweet, but in my opinion, it was a great balance of sweet and sour.  We finished off the evening with two servings of Churros, because apparently we just still weren't full enough.   I cannot wait to return here again! I have actually made reservations a couple times with a friend already, but unfortunately, life's timing just hasn't worked out yet.  So what are you waiting for? Go make reservations now! You can get \"prime time\" weekend reservations about four weeks in advance currently.",

    "text": "Absolutely loved Morcilla! I couldn't wait to try out this new spot and it certainly did not disappoint. We went with fellow foodie friends so we could enjoy a lot of the menu items and that we did! I started with the park guell cocktail and it was excellent. I also was able to try my friends rebujito that was also a fabulous choice.    Our server was extremely helpful in explaining the portion sizes for each item and when we needed to order more then one to split for the table. She was friendly and provided great recommendations. There honestly was not one dish that we didn't all love. It was such a fun dinner from beginning to end with each bite being better than the last. I would highly recommend any of the following dishes that we had.   From the Pintxos section we started with the Island Creek Oysters (excellent!), the Cecina which was the dried cured beef with cara cara oranghe (so delicious), Chistora, tiny chorizo wrapped in a potato chip (loved this!), crab butter churros (melt in your mouth) and the manchego cheese (one of my favorite cheeses so it was perfection!) From the Montadito's section we shared the beef tartare and the smoked spreadable salami. Both were excellent, especially surprising was the spreadable salami. The flavors combined with the hazelnut and dried apple were outstanding. From the plates we shared the lamb meatballs which some thought was the best dish of the night. They were excellent. And lastly, we shared the pollo platter. Again, this was also fantastic. The salsa verde was a perfect combination with the crispy chicken.    There were four of us and our server suggested ordering about 10-12 small dishes. Keep in mind this is tapas style so some of the Pintxos and Montadito's section are only a few bites. The platters are a bit larger, which as I mentioned, our server was excellent at guiding us through the menu so that we had the opportunity to try a lot of items. I only took a photo of my first beverage because after that we were enjoying every single bite so much. I definitely can't wait to go back!",

This used to be a great place a few years ago when it opened, price has considerably gone up with the hype. A few dishes are great but, as Spaniard, they mess up others--iberic ham for example was too thick, which is a waste of the product. Frozen crema catalana for dessert is not good (it shouldnt be frozen!). Probably the best Spanish restauranr in town but still lots to learn and improve",

Even though I don't eat meat (I came here once before when I did used to eat meat and it was divine as well), there were a ton of options on the menu -it did help that I do eat fish though.   My partner and I started off with a tuna dish -poke-like tuna, with peaches, a saffron chili oil, microgreens and wonderful fried shiitake mushrooms. We then ordered the ox-tail (for him), the most recent octopus dish, and championones a la plancha (mushrooms). WOW. The octopus and mushroom dishes were definitely our favorites. The octopus is cooked perfectly and served alongside chickpeas that are pickled and then rolled in (a spice that I cannot remember). Mushrooms were mixed together with an egg yolk -the flavor was definitely a little heavy but insanely delicious, especially when you topped the bread with it. All the dishes (save for the platters) are tapas-sized. We ordered 4 dishes, which was the perfect amount for us to enjoy dinner and still get dessert.  For dessert, we ordered the churros and frozen crema catalana. The chocolate/hazelnut sauce that came with the churros was the perfect amount of bitterness (great chocolate). The crema catalana we had was a simple vanilla and maple flavor. Again, delicious, a bit lighter than a creme brulee. Overall, the meal was fantastic. As for the actual setting, the tables are a bit close together and lighting is a bit dim, so it's definitely better for a more intimate dinner. The service was fantastic -Sara(h) recommended us fantastic wines to go along with our dishes.",

Maybe I'd had too much to drink the first visit, but the second time back I only have good things to say about it! We went in around 5 on a Saturday and got seats at the bar with plans to just have a few drinks and maybe a snack. Of course you can't read the menu and only get one dish, so we ended up ordering quite a few and making it dinner.   Everything we ordered was amazing. Serrano ham is so simple but just well done. The tuna crudo we got with peaches was a great combination of flavors as was the anchovy/tomato toast and the artic char a la plancha. However - the unexpected standout was the pistachio-grape-cucumber gazpacho that was on the menu. Seriously - unreal! It had a black garlic oil and some crunchy pistachios and grape halves and ... yum. The boyfriend and I both agreed this might have been one of our all-time favorite dishes.  Overall - great atmosphere, great drinks, great food. Definitely a favorite in Pittsburgh!",

The only reservation I could snag was 4 p.m. on a Sunday. When I returned the obligatory call to confirm, I was told that I could not come later as they were \"fully committed to our other guests.\"  In contrast, our server was totally friendly and completely unpretentious. She fully explained a menu that needed little explanation -- I didn't have the heart to interrupt,  We began with an Oloroso sherry for me and the house white sangria for my partner. Both were perfect.  While I considered an \"All the Meats\" it seemed like it would unbalance the meal, so we plumped for Iberico, Fuet and Cecina instead. The perfectly sliced Iberico was topped with halved Marcona almonds. There is no question it was handled properly, still it is better and cheaper on its home turf. (I envied another table's Serrano - a more generous portion to be sure) The chef's homeamde fuet was excellent, fatty and flavorful. I had never had the Spanish style cecina, which is more like bresaola or bunderfleisch than the beef jerky style Mexican cecina. It was delicate and mild. The fuet and cecina were served with toasts, we asked and received extras to have enough for the iberico as well. Definitely spring for the chef's cured meats.  I segued into a glass of Tempranillo.  We limited ourselves to once conserva, the beets. They were babies and barely trimmed, so you ate the whole delicate thing. Four to a portion. To me, conservas would also mean the tinned seafood so beloved in Spain but none are found in this section of the menu.  From the croquetas, we chose pigs' feet and cheeks the squash and maple giving it a taste of Thanksgiving. The texture was perfect, but I didn't find the flavor profile to be Spanish, despite the pimenton. Still they were delicious, and the three balls were gone in falsh.  Next up was the eponymous Morcilla. A single delicate sausage, on a bed of chestnut puree. The highlight of the meal. The oxtail Montadito was also superb, the Mahon cheese more pungent than I expected, the melt in your mouth quality unlike any other Montadito in my experience.  We finished with a half order of the ribs. Meltingly tender as well, they were a good segue to dessert.  I had originally intended to order the frozen crema Catalana and the churros, but a cooler head prevailed, and we found the good sized crema sufficient for two. Think a warm burnt caramel creme brulee topping over a frozen panna cotta.   About $180 for two people with tip, total of three drinks, no coffee or tea. Worth it.",

Our server was so pleasant and answered all of our many questions. She took the time to briefly explain all of the cocktails and wine to us so we could make a great choice. I also loved the coat check they had at the host stand. The person who seemed to be the manager came around at the end to check on us and ask about our meal and it was appreciated.   Second, I loved the inside of the space. It's small but comfortable. I appreciate the bar area without stools where you are free to stand and have a drink and small plate. A lot of great little touches on the decor and presentation   Last, the food! I cannot even list everything we ordered because with four people, we ordered about 10-15 smaller options and then two large plates and shared everything. Some favorite small options were the crab and tarragon churros, the bacalao, and the jamon croquetas. Everything we had was good and full of flavor. The only reason I gave 4 stars is that I don't feel like I'm racing to make another reservation. We tried a good portion of the menu, pretty much everything that sounded delicious to us, and it was good. But I'd love to see how often the menu will change or have rotating items to go back for new things!",
