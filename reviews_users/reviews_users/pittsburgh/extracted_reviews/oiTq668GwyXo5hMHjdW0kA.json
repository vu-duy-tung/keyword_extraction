    "text": "My girlfriend and I had a great time here during our brief visit to the 'Burgh.  My bacon-cheddar burger on a pretzel bun w/ spicy garlic BBQ sauce & cajun fries was the perfect way to soak up Saturday night's alcohol.  My girlfriend really enjoyed her turkey burger wrap w/ guacamole.  They have the NFL Sunday Ticket with plenty of TVs (our booth had it's own TV), and plenty of seating between the downstairs and upstairs bars, so it's a perfect place to watch the games.  Our waitress was attentive and always ready to refill our drinks before we had to ask.  The GM came by our table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and put the game we wanted to watch on our booth's TV--he's a good dude.    If you're in/around Shady Side and haven't hit Stack'd yet, you're missing out.",

The options for customizing your burger are quite impressive and overwhelming.  I literally garnished mine with pretty much every ulcer inducing spice available.  My carnivore friend really enjoyed his burger as well.  The quantity of food in one meal is enough to feed a small African village.  The price is fair.  Service was good.  If you're looking to catch a game or just chill in a nice area, go upstairs and have a seat at the bar where you will enjoy dining in front of numerous and huge flat screen TVs.",

The burgers are MYO; I made veggie with fresh jalapeno,  avocado and Chipotle mayo.  I'm picky when it comes to veggie patties, so i consulted the chef/bar tender first.  He said it was made with black beans and very  good.  He was right.  It was great. Fresh,  tasty,  slightly crunchy on the outside, warm and moist inside. I didn't order fries,  so you're on your own there.  That guy, and the other bar tender were both very friendly and attentive.  I'll be back,  for sure.",

    "text": "What a little gem in Shadyside. I lived here for 3 years right down the road and never went here. However, I just went in last night for the $3 veggie burger special! Unfortunately, I didn't realize that the special was only for 9-midnight, but that did not stop me from still getting the burger and leave me wanting to go here next Wednesday night. A friend and I stopped in here after work and just made it in time for happy hour- which I would say is not very good compared to similar restaurants (drafts are only $1 off). However, the list is pretty incredible and they do have good drinks specials on other nights (I think I read they have $1 mixed drinks on Thursday nights, which makes me want to go back tonight and take the morning off work tomorrow!). We received our burger check list and I was pleasantly surprised and the diversity of sauces, toppings, and add-ons to my burger. You can get up to 4 toppings free- further, the happy hour included half-off a basket of fries. The quality of the burger was very good. I enjoyed the food, the venue (which I didn't realize until I walked out that there is an entire second floor with a full bar and tables upstairs), and I am looking forward to coming back to enjoy some of the specials.",

    "text": "Found this establishment while strolling around downtown Shadyside.  There were three of us, my wife, and 18 year old son.  They use the \"build your own\" burger concept where you fill out a questionnaire type menu with the burger type, bun, toppings, sauce, etc.  They also have a large selection of beers, domestic, import and craft.  What seems to set them apart are the choice of toppings and sauces, some truly original!  Choose from toppings l like mac and cheese, olives, fried egg or Fritos, or standards like bacon, lettuce and tomato.  Sauces are unique too - Jerk, Cajun, OMFG! (Hot), and basic like BBQ, or Teriyaki.  I had the standard beef  1/2lb burger, and the sear and meat was truly excellent.  The meat was tender, tasty and well prepared.  They seem to cook everything to a medium well, but nevertheless the meat was delicious.  The wide had a veggie patty that I tried and found tasteless and boring.  She said she liked it, so go figure.  Summary: worth the time for a quick brew and burger wither lunch or dinner.",

The place is nice, although small.  We were the only customers on a Sunday afternoon.  We were given a menu and a pencil.  You check off on the menu what you want and the waitress comes back to pick up your choices.  We ordered the chili cheese fries as an appetizer and they were really good.  After we ordered, I realized we weren't asked on the menu card of by the waitress how we wanted our burgers prepared.  We do not like our burgers cooked well, so I went to find our waitress at the bar.  I asked her if we could have our burgers prepared rare.  She said that they prepare all burgers medium well, but would ask to get ours as rare as possible.  I'm a little confused on why a burger joint would prepare all burgers medium well, when there are so many ways to prepare a burger.  The burgers were ok, nothing really to brag about, but my onion rings were very tasty.  Not sure I will be back.",

    "text": "My friend and I ventured here to have a nice bite to eat after we escaped the rain of the Pitt game, and I have to admit, Stack'd has me hooked and wanting more.   My biggest compliment is the fact that they have a variety of food, not just burgers.  Wings, yes, wings, and they are delicious wings with many sauces to choose from.  Lots of appetizer choices, and everything is very affordable.  I was actually blown away by the affordable prices since it is in a more upscale area.  Burger was really tasty.  Toppings that usually cost extra at other burger places were free here.  I got a double blue cheese burger with grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, roasted red peppers, and spinach all for $8.  At other places that would cost me like $12 for all those toppings.  Sides are a la carte, but for only a buck or two you can add fries or onion rings.  One of my complaints is that their burgers are cooked well done with nothing stated on the menu otherwise.  I honestly didn't mind it being cooked so much, but next time I go, I am asking for some pink.    Biggest complaint was that both my friend and mine's buns were cool, like refrigerator cold.  I was surprised when I went to go pick up my burger and was caught off guard by the chill.  I figured all places have gotten to the point of throwing the buns on the grill before they served it up?  Hmmmmm.. maybe next time.  All in all, absolutely delicious.  I cannot wait to go back and build another delicious burger.  Next time I am saving room for a milkshake.",

I decided to pass on the free burger offered to me by the owner; I figured I would give Stack'd an honest chance as a regular paid customer. I appreciate the gesture from them though!  I can't believe the wacky things they have to put on burgers...mozzarella sticks, PEANUT BUTTER, etc. Very cool. I stuck with a rather traditional bacon cheeseburger to test the waters. I like that they offer pretzel buns, and it was tasty although I wish it were slightly sweeter like pretzel buns I've had in the past. The beef itself was very tasty (luckily I like my burgers well done, and it as actually very juicy for a well done burger). My onion rings on the side were standard but tasty. We got a milkshake for an extra $5...eh. It was good but it wasn't $5 good.  I'm not in Shadyside often because I don't like paying $4 to park for a couple hours...but if I am ever in the area this is definitely a place I would visit again!",

The burger was tasty and just what I needed, it reminded me of burgatory but cheaper and closer, and since it was pretty late on a weekday it wasn't crowded at all although the staff seemed in a hurry to get out.

    "text": "Stack'd...your concept is brilliant but your dining room could use some extra side work.  The choices on the burger BYO was impressive.  But why be so specific about toppings and then not ask me what temperature I want my burger cooked to?  I like the decor and the music selection, but when there are six people in the restaurant, why is the bar music at a level that makes conversation near impossible...?  The food looks and smells fantastic.  I just got a glimpse and a whiff of the stuff the annoying hipsters next to us ordered.  My own food, however, has taken over twenty minutes at this point.  (We ordered two burgers and an order of ten wings.)  Your bartender texts a lot but at least she makes rounds frequently.  My burger was good.  So were my wings.  The fries were a little lackluster, but hey, they're fries.  And they're not bad, just not what I expected.    Your napkins are too soft for wings.  And the bartender just took a plate out from under my girlfriend's face while she was eating.  Like elbows on the table chowing down on a wing.  Now, we both work  in the service industry - I'm a chef and she's a GM - and that just isn't done.  I have to say, until that, I would have given you two stars for food and thrown you on my take-out list.  Now, we won't be back.",

    "text": "One of my favorite restaurants.  The Good:  - Half off appetizers M-F from 5PM-7PM. This is why we go. They also have other half-off deals that are good deals.  - Their appetizer menu is fabulous. Chicken wings, pretzels, 3 different kinds of french fries(curly fries, normal McDonald's like fries and cajun fries with a little spice), tater tots, nachos, very good fried mac and cheese balls and nachos. It's maybe my favorite appetizer menu in the whole city. Good luck getting curly fries anywhere else in the city except Arby's.  - The staff is quite nice.  - They have you fill out check boxes for what you want on the menu. Due to this, they never get my order wrong.  - They have a lot of different options for toppings on burgers. Fritos, chicken, fried mac and cheese, the usuals and more.   - They offer cheese sauce on the side. I can put cheese sauce on anything so this is a huge plus for me.  The Bad:  - This location is not really good. You wouldn't know about it unless you got lucky.  - It's small and gets insanely crowded fast.  - Parking in Shadyside is never fun, easy or cheap. We don't go a lot because it's a hassle.  - They don't advertise, which is a shame, because I know people would love it.  - It is expensive. We only go when it's half-off because we like to order lots of apps  - Their burgers are a bit small, and I'd think you'd have to get at least a double burger to be satisfied.  - If you get take out, the discounts and specials don't apply. I'd go more since it's so small if I could get the usual deals on takeout.  Overall thoughts: I really do like this restaurant and foodwise it's a 10 out of 10 for me. The bad thing is that I really can only go during a weekday around 5pm due to pricing, which sucks. Keep an eye on this place because it's going to be a big thing real soon.",

There are four TVs at the bar and it looks like it seats a lot of people in a small space without being crushed.  Second, I'm struggling with the value.  The burger was okay.  When you're only known for one thing, you should do that thing really well.  I elected to go with the 1/4 pound burger instead of the 1/2 pound (one patty vs. two patties).  My burger was quite frankly dry and didn't taste like much.  It was also quite a bit smaller than the whole wheat bun.  I tasted the toppings more - tomatoes, spinach, and Fritos.  There were only about 5 Fritos on top.  I think I also put a honey ranch sauce or something - clearly it didn't make an impression and was really only there to give it some moisture.  Third, the fries.  They were good, but again, average.  I understand that in America we're used to getting 3 serving's worth of fries, so when I was presented with the small pile of fries, I was a little miffed.  $2 extra for just plain fries.  No curlies, no seasoning, nothing fancy.  If you want fries on the side, get the fancy ones because no matter what, you're paying a flat rate of two dollars.  I don't know what their business model is, but I would happily have a small side of fries or chips given to me and if I wanted something special (seasoned fries, curlies, etc) I would gladly pay extra.  I would come back on their burger night for half-priced burgers, but I'm not sure if I'd make the trip out here on any other occasion.",

The ordering and service model is similar to Burgatory, but the actual product runs laps around it. The burgers are mouth-wateringly flavorful and endlessly customizable.  The shakes are definitely a 'meh' and are what holds this back from a 5/5 for me. Not to keep invoking B-tory, but their shakes are way better. The beer and TVs here also make this a great gameday joint.  Would highly recommend!",

I was pleasantly surprised when they served the fries with liquid nacho cheese. I prefer that to melted shredded cheese which I found is popular in other places around here. Highly recommended! The only reason it's not getting 5 stars is because of how loud/dark the bar area is and how rude they are about the TVs in the booths. All we did was turn ours off and we ended up getting a 5 minute lecture about breaking it. Besides that I will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Half-priced burgers Tuesday Night (I kinda don't want to advertise this here at the fear of the place being crowded when I go!). A great deal - 3 bucks for a 1/2 lb burger and then you can add a bunch of free toppings and then other toppings are like a buck each. My burger with cheese and fried egg, cucumbers, relish, sauteed mushrooms and banana peppers with cajun fries was a total of 6 bucks (as a graduate student, I will gladly take up on anything that gets me full in 6 bucks) - and can't forget the 6 dollar pittcher of yuengling.  The thing I like about the upstairs is that it doesn't really get crowded until a bit later (I am talking about the weekends) - though right off of walnut. They have a ton of TVs and decent drink prices, cheap beer, a couple of dart boards as well. So they do have that going for them and I usually like coming here if I want somewhere happening but not somewhere where I have to bump into 40 people just to get to the bar.  As for the burgers - mind you they are tasty. Mine was a tad bit over done yesterday but I finished the whole thing - so that is a testament to my hunger as well as the tastiness of the burger (my friend got chicken fingers on a burger - where else can you add chicken fingers on a burger for a buck).  All in a all, a toned down version of walnut that I don't mind going to. Thursday nights aren't super crowded either (and for you vegetarians out there - it's half price veggie burgers on wednesdays)",

When I went there on a Saturday, 18:40, the place seemed understaffed and the staff appeared really stressed. You are expected to seat yourself, so I sat down and rotated my head looking around for about 10 minutes before a staff member came and threw a menu card/order sheet at me. It then took about 25 minutes for my order to be completed -- fairly reasonable speed considering how busy it was.  The 3/4 lb burger came with three 1/4 lb patties. Each was a bit dry; but overall the burger was pretty good. The fried pierogi were big and pretty standard. The fries were nothing special -- a bit worse than McDonald's fries. Overall, it was decent value for the meal considering how customizable everything is, but nothing is particularly outstanding. The value is even better if you show up on half price time (Tuesday 9pm to Midnight).",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here in search of a cheap burger place within walking distance of our house. We both spend a decent amount of time near Walnut Street shopping and going on runs and such, but we have never found a place for a quick bite in the vicinity. I'm sure we'll come back here, but only during off-peak hours since the atmosphere isn't as nice as that of some of our favorite spots.  We walked in and figured that it was seat yourself. I believe there was a sign saying that, but I remember it being turned around so I couldn't really read it. We got a roomy booth and were soon greeted by the waitress for our section. The draft list and BYO burger sheets were on the table, so ordering was pretty self explanatory. We went with soft drinks, since the draft list had no prices anywhere. I feel awkward asking about beer prices, but at the same time I just won't get a draft of something if it's $2 or $3 more than somewhere else where I just had the same thing. Call me crazy, but I'll probably go with the slightly cheaper option in that case. I've been skewered paying $8.50 for a tiny pour at places with no listed prices before, so that's probably just a (very) personal pet peeve of mine. The lack of beer prices on the draft list and the fact that there were TVs at every single booth were my two biggest complaints. It seemed like a sports bar for pretty boy bros, when it really could have been a cozy burger joint tucked away off of Walnut Street.  The food is the reason this pace gets 3 stars from me, since it was reasonably priced for the quantity and everything came out hot and well-assembled. During super busy times this probably isn't the case, but $6 for a 1/2lb burger (before fries) isn't a bad deal overall. I also liked how their hot BBQ sauce was actually spicy, and I'll definitely be getting all my sandwiches with it in future. My boyfriend loved his burger as well. We'll be back during times when it's sure to be less crowded, like for an early weekend dinner or a lunch, never when there's a game on.",

    "text": "I moved to Shadyside this past week, and after an intense morning of heavy lifting, I thought I'd try ordering some pick-up from a local spot. My neighbors were talking up Stack'd, saying they had a pleasant experience on their $3 burger night, and their website touted themselves as the self-proclaimed Best Burger in Shadyside, so why not?  Ah, Shadyside. Don't let the promising menus and beautiful restaurants fool you--this aesthetic appeal is all just a clever ruse, masking the overpriced mediocrity of a bland experience. Regrefully, the food is just as gentrified as the neighborhood, and although solid experiences exist (e.g. BRGR, Soba, Casbah), they are startlingly few.  The burger--I had a Stack'd Burger (2 1/4 pound patties) had a well-made garlic BBQ sauce on it, and I don't have any complaints about the presentation...but the burger itself seemed frozen. Now, I don't want to make any accusations, as the menu says that it's a special blend recipe made fresh, but they were in perfect circles and had that flattened look of the frozen bulk-brand school-lunch burger. And, I don't want to make any accusations, but the taste verified my thoughts.  The fries--I added a side order of fries for an extra buck. I was given eighteen thin, fast-food style fries. So what, I counted. I like thin fries. But I also like Wendy's, and so far this meal has added up to be a little bit more expensive than the fast-food alternative.  The milkshake--this five-dollar milkshake provided yet again an overpriced let-down.  The salad--the final blow was the salad. I ordered a grilled chicken caesar, and was given grilled chicken, shredded lettuce, and Kraft parmesan cheese. I'm not sure if they under-dressed the salad or forgot the dressing altogether, but it was surprisingly bland and bare. Hello Bistro offers a great $9 salad, and you can get caesar dressing on it, too, but you also get a little bit more than Kraft parmesan and lettuce. Even Wendy's throws in cherry tomatoes.  All of this came to a whopping $23. I understand that fast-casual isn't fancy, but it also shouldn't equate to fast-food at double the price.  My gripe is that a place like this has so much potential, and from the look of the menu, it's everything I've ever wanted in a fast-casual experience. I love the atmosphere, I love the options, I love everything about it...except for the food. Best Burger in Shadyside? Sorry. I might come back for a $3 special sometime, but other than that, let's just add this place to the ever-expanding list of Shadyside let-downs.",

    "text": "I waited to try this place, given the iffy reviews it got when it first opened....  I'm glad I finally did try Stack'd because last night I had one tasty burger!  I think my first question about Stack'd was...  where IS it?  It's in Shadyside off Walnut, in the space that was the Pittsburgh Deli Co.  Last night was a Tuesday, which meant that the Stack'd burgers were 1/2 price.  The special applies *only* to the Stack'd burger which is a two patty burger.  I was disappointed because I wanted the small burger, or the chicken sandwich.    I think this is the kind of food issue only a woman would have, as my males friends were ready to chow down.  There are endless combinations of ways you can order your burger.  You chose the size of your burger, and they also offer chicken and veggie burgers. You have your choice of bun:  sesame, kaiser, wheat, no bun, and a wrap.  There is a very long list of sauces to choose from, and just about every topping you could ever imagine.  I had the Stack'd burger, on a sesame bun, with American cheese, sweet baby Ray's bbq sauce, a little bit of pineapple mayo, pickles, romaine lettuce, red onions, and a toasted pineapple.  It was EXCELLENT.  My friend got fritos and a fried egg on her burger.  i would never ever order that but she seemed to enjoy it...and you know, I like having the opportunity to have, say, fritos and peanut butter and general tsos sauce on a burger!  My burger and a pitcher of Yuengling ($6 pitchers on tuesday) came to $11.50.  Not too bad!  I recommend this place highly, and if you're not sure about the food--just come on a Tuesday night when the burgers are 1/2 off.",

Stackd's milkshakes are pretty good as well and offer a lot of good, basic flavors like chocolate, vanilla, peanut butter, etc. Their fishbowls are a fantastic deal and are only $15 and even cheaper if you split the cost with friends. Stack'd is my favorite place to go on Walnut st. and is a Pittsburgh classic for college students.",

But they are too thick and greasy to my liking. The onion rings are greasy too and the onions were not soft enough. The burgers were good, normal fastfood good, not amazingly good. And the top bread was cold when they were presented to us so points off. Honestly I don't even know how this place gets an average 4. Anyway, my favorite burger joint will still be the Winghart's!!",

    "text": "This is quite the momentous occasion for me...my first yelp review!  Do I get some type of reward?  Preferably it'd be something edible.  I was pretty thrilled to hear that a Burgatory-esque joint was opening up in Shadyside, but would it match up to Burgatory?  My experience at Stack'd was interesting: UPS: -My burger was pretty delicious.  Fritos, guac, banana peppers, grilled onions, lettuce, pepper jack cheese and stack'd sauce...That is just a clear-cut recipe for burger heaven. -It's a nice sports bar, good deals (Tuesday's burgers are half off!) -Location, location, location.  It was nice to eat dinner/get some drinks, then venture off to the other Shadyside bars for the night.  DAHNS: -There is nowhere to check off on your order sheet how you would like your burger cooked.  All of our burgers were close to well done, this seemed to really bother a couple of my friends...and it makes sense.  Why try to give us the experience of total control over our food, but not with the most rudimentary element of the experience itself?  Seems backwards to me. -The service.....oh the service.  I try to be patient, understanding, etc, with food service having had experience with it, but this brought poor tending to a whole new level.  The only example I need to give is after we ordered a pitcher of beer and it was delivered to our table (about 15 minutes later), we didn't have cups to drink that beer for about another 10 minutes.  My friends contemplated passing around the pitcher and taking sips communion style (My friends are jags, clearly).  Overall:  -I'm a sucker for anything burgers, so I'd rule Stack'd as a good burger place, local to me.  But, if I feel like making the trek to Burgatory, they shall victor over Stack'd easily.  I will definitely be visiting Stack'd again, in hopes that the poor service was just due to chance.    4 stars for you, Stack'd.  Albeit if half stars were available, i'd give you 3 and a half...just to keep you on your toes.",

Stack'd has two identities the downstairs is usually full of college kids while the upstairs caters a bit more to young professionals... or at least that's how it seems to me .  Staff seems more friendly and outgoing than the normal bar in the area, so thats always a plus.  During the week you can get their build your own burger/ veggie burger on Tuesday and Wednesday for $3  and a pitcher of yuengling to wash it down for $5. There are about 25 free options and a few more for a dollar or two extra. Burgers are well executed even if you are like me and get more than one sauce.  On the weekends if i am looking to avoid the crowds and just chill with some friends I got upstairs. Its never crowded service is quick and prices are good.  I always try to go here with my friends even though most don't know it exists or have never been, so if you are looking for a chill night this is a great place to start.",

The burger is 1/4 pound but you get 2 for $6.                 And you can add another.  Cooked mild well, only.                 Stack'd has its own blend of fresh meat for the burger. Step 2  - Choose a bread - 5 choices including a wrap. Step 3 - Add a cheese - 5 cheeses.  American blue, provolone, feta, cheddar. Step 4 - Slather in Sauce - about 20 different including OMFG (Very HOT) Step 5 - Top it off - about 20 toppings - from lettuce , to various peppers, pickles, etc. Add to your order if you want fries, from regular, curly, cajun, old bay.  Wait and get hungry watching everyone else in the place chow down.  My burger was stack'd high, very good and juicy.  Would have preferred medium burger; seemed to be a little to well done for my taste.  The cajun fries are very good and spicy; long thin crisp fries.   The back of the checklist has salads, crisp wings with about 8 dipped and 5 rubbed flavors.   Add another good burger joint to list.  Stack'd is rather small with 4 booths, 4 tables and about 10 bar stools.  4 TV's and a large beer list with about 20 drafts. Service was very friendly made sure we had refills.",

    "text": "First off I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by how clean it was in here, especially at the bar area, and the reason I am not giving it only two stars is because of the cleanliness.  My friend and I always order two things and split them in half to share since we usually want the same things. We ordered potato skins (I had been craving some for awhile now and saw them on the menu here so that's why we decided to give this place a shot) and got a quarter pound burger on a pretzel bun. We got the burger with lettuce, grilled onions, frito's, spicy ranch, and avocado's so let me just say I was excited for all those flavors! When it came to the potato skins I was disappointed even at first glance since I noticed that the cheese on top had not melted all the way and they seemed very oily. As for taste they were bland and greasy. The burger was disappointing as well. Let me tell you now that I do not recommend getting a quarter pound burger on a pretzel bun because it just is too small for that amount of bread, there was a least an inch of extra bread around the burger. The burger meat itself tasted unseasoned and not that great. The toppings made it slightly better, but there were maybe two frito's on the burger and I basically only tasted the avocado. We also got curly fries on the side and they were lukewarm to start and cold after a few minutes had past.   On the plus side, the prices were a little cheaper than Burgatory or BRGR, but the taste does not make up for it. The bartender was also super nice and attentive. I don't know who controls the music, but it was perfect! It was like they took all my ITunes playlists, so that is another plus.   I might come back for just drinks, but there are plenty of other options on Walnut street that might be better quality overall.",

DJ went through the burger process pretty well so I'll just add a few comments-- --Burgers are only available medium well.  We asked for less, and were told this was the only option.  Still, the burger (stack) that arrived was indeed medium well and not well, so that was something.  It was also surprisingly juicy for something cooked that much. --$6 for a half pound of meat (double burger) with lots of free toppings.  Many creative ones as well (peanut butter, fried mac & cheese ($), mozz sticks ($)) --$1 extra for a variety of fries--we tried the curly, the cajun, and the Old Bay.  The Old Bay fries were way oversalted (like they had been seasoned with Old Bay, which contains salt, and then salted as if regular fries), the curly fries were good, and the cajun fries were really tasty.  This was a nice portion for $1. --$1 off all drinks during Happy Hour weekdays until 7 (not sure when it starts), and $6 Yuengling pitchers until midnight.  This part is a continuation from Fieldhouse (the previous tenant).  Fieldhouse was probably my favorite Shadyside bar, and Stack'd hasn't changed much except for the burger twist (and they're missing the zucchini fries).  This is still a great place to catch a game, or three--there are enough TVs to follow many games at once, and there are TVs in every booth. Definitely a solid option if you're in the neighborhood!  Update: their dry-rubbed wings are really really good.  The sauced ones are okay, but for $9/dozen I want excellent.  Give them a try (and they'll let you do 6 and 6 instead of the whole dozen as one flavor)!",

I ordered a burger with BBQ and Chrissy Onions. I was disappointed when I got my burger and it was just a burger with sauce on it. My other roommate ordered onion and mushrooms on hers and received hers with no mushrooms. Turns out my missing onions and her missing mushrooms ended up on the other roommates burger. Good thing she likes onions and mushrooms. It was starting to get busy by the time we got our food and the waitress just disappeared. She dropped off the checks and then an hour later she came back to pick them up. I was expecting slow service due to the $1 well night and completely understand due to being in the service industry before. Over all I was very disappointed with the food. My burger could have been amazing. But it wasn't. There are so many other build your own burger places in Pittsburgh. I'll probably be going elsewhere next time.",

    "text": "Very average, in a town with an extraordinary number of burger joint options, many of which are actually fantastic.  Not awful, but not worth a rave either.   First, a basic description.  It's small but very brightly lit, which could be a pro or a con, depending on your preferences and mood.  It's got a bar, but the whole vibe is more breakfast-at-the-diner than evening hangout.  The booths have individual TVs, which is kinda cool, but I didn't get to try them out because the only one available when I got there was right in the front.  That would have been fine, except the outside lights were shining right into my eyes, which live at a fairly low elevation in relationship to sea level, and the paramedic in me is constitutionally incapable of eating with my back to a door or window like that, especially when alone.    Food wise, you mark your choices on preprinted pads and hand it to the server, so there should be no ambiguity about your order.  Pretty simple.   My burger came overcooked to almost completely well done, but since I had not been asked how I wanted it *and* I had forgotten to specify it on my own, *and* it was late and I was hungry, I let it go and ate it anyways.  It was decent, and at least not completely dried out, but definitely nothing special.   I ordered the Stack'd burger, which was supposed to be a half pound burger, thinking I'd cut it in half and take part of it home since that's really too much meat for one sitting.  Nope, not gonna happen; all they did was put two regular size 1/4 lb. patties on one regular size bun, which just made it impossible to get in my mouth, especially with the toppings I ordered.    It was 1/2 off, though, because it was a Tuesday night, so that was nice, and eased that pain. Which turned out to be irrelevant anyways, since I ended up inhaling everything on my plate, but I digress...  Fortunately, I had also actually planned to eat it with a fork and knife that night, to skip part of the bun's calories (what is that they say about the road to hell and intentions?), but since I ended up ordering fewer toppings than I initially intended, the thought to pick it up like normal did cross my mind, but alas, it was simply not possible. I've got a big mouth in general, just not literally :-)  And... they left out the mushrooms, so I had to send it back to get them.  They left out the mushrooms!  Not the end of the world, really, but they *did* have it in writing right in front of them.  Rather than come to the table when I signaled her desperately, the bartender/waitress asked from the bar what I needed -which would have necessitated my shouting over the music, which I declined to do.    I had already also had to ask for a napkin and indeed a setup at all when they brought my beer, so I was just a wee bit irritated, and the server was paying a lot more attention to the guys at the bar than the rest of the room. I don't like having to drag the most basic of basics out of restaurants like that.  The fries were only sort of edible because they were literally soggy and almost dripping with grease, not even close to crisp and fresh.    That was so disappointing.  If you're going to blow your diet, including the one you had only just decided to start, at least it should be worth it.  But, see above about inhaling.  I was more overcome with hunger than I had realized and also figured that the odds of anything better coming out if I complained were likely slim.    I do have to say that they got the parts of my order that I wanted on the side and not on the burger correct, including my decidedly odd request to put the sauce on the bottom half of the bun instead of the top.  Kudos for that!  And they have a very nice beer selection, with a number of good options on tap.  The server was very willing to bring me a taste of something I wanted to try, and very nice in general.    They are also open late, which is great for us night owls.    They advertise that they are open until midnight, but I don't know if you can actually still get food then, since they told me at 11:55 that they were closing in 5 minutes, as in hint, hint, your stint in here is through.  I was the only person left in there by that time, though, and I *had* been taking my sweet time with my beer and a good book on my Kindle.  I won't take off a star as I often do because the place is completely inaccessible, with a very steep staircase, because it really is not fixable in this case, but potential customers should be aware that they are not going to get in there with a chair or walker, or even \"just\" difficulty walking.    I do wish that businesses would not rent inaccessible locations like this to start with, though, and generally try not to patronize them even when I can, because I *do* use a chair sometimes myself (and numerous friends do as well, some of them full time), and it always just feels like a giant slap in the face, or at least something dangled in front of us only to be told we cannot have it.",

I believe that if you give a crappy review and the place has turned around you should inform people that you have had a change of heart. After my first post the manager got in contact with me and I answered some of his questions. He genuinely wanted to know about my last few experiences, and how he could make up for them. I was just appreciative that he saw a problem and wanted to make his establishment better. I went in a couple of nights ago because grad school is frying my brain, and I needed a burger. When I went in Jessica was there and she greeted me and was extremely kind and helpful. I went back again and I got the same service :attentive, and welcoming, AND My order was correct.    This place found a problem and made a change. I haven't been in when Jessica isn't working so I cannot speak for all of the staff, but it was enough to make me not want to cringe about the thought of going back.     --------------------------------------------------",

    "text": "Stack'd has got some stacked burger competition. With BRGR right around the corner, two Winghart's locations and two Burgatory locations... along with Tessaro's and a handful of other joints, you gotta really make those patties shine to get noticed in town.   Did they shine? Not so much. It wasn't a bad burger. It just wasn't great either. To be honest, I really think that it may have been a frozen patty. It had that perfectly rounded shape that you see when you buy them pre-pattied (is that a word?) in the store. You're able to pick from a checklist of ingredients. I mean, TONS! And not just ketchup and mustard, but mac n' cheese and tator tots on top of the burger. I literally don't know how you'd eat the thing!   What I've learned in my burger eating days is that I like to keep it simple. For me it's #1 the burger quality, #2 the cheese and #3 the sauce. I was really excited to try the Big Mac sauce they call McDowell sauce (why that name, no idea). Listen, I can't lie. Sometimes scarfing down a McD's burger is delicious. It may be when I'm super hungry and craving that type of food, but I'll instantly regret it after. I did not instantly regret it after, but the whole burger just fell flat. While the sauce was good, I really think it was the issue with the burger. Just not quality meat, no taste and possibly from a frozen patty.   I ordered the tots on the side because they sounded so good on the toppings menu. They were tots. Again, I could get these tots out of the frozen section of Giant Eagle. Not that I'm expecting gourmet tots... this was just something I that I knew how it would taste before I got it. I was just lusting after some fried potatoes.   The beer list actually looked decent and so did the boozy shakes. But after the burger, I'd be afraid to try them. Knowing that around the corner in East Liberty I'd be getting a delectable shake from BRGR. I wouldn't go out of my way to come here again. Actually, I'd probably not even suggest it. Just go to Winghart's, you'll be happy you did, I promise!",

Tried the appetizer of pork nachos this time- absolutely terrible. It was a sloppy BBQ chili mixture on top of generic chips you probably can buy at Aldi (I wish I was kidding about the chips). Absolutely nothing special about these and sort of gross when you start eating.. they should try to improve by making their own chips or at least trying to fake it.   Also- just like burgatory everything costs extra- cheese is $1 and a choice of a side (general fries for example) is $2... the base burger is $8 itself plus add-ons you're not leaving there without a 12-14 dollar burger plus your side of choice. Personally, there's a lot of other small burger places in Pittsburgh that make just as good of burgers and don't charge the shit out of you for every single thing. But hey, if you're looking for a burger, willing to spend 2.00 for approximately 12 fries... go for it, but it can be better elsewhere.",

You get a sheet where you can mark the qualifications of your burger- bun, size, condiments, cheese, random toppings, etc and hand it to the waitress.   The burger itself was OK- nothing stood out for me. The price point was fine as well. It was hard to get service, and when at first we didn't remember who our waitress was, we made the mistake of asking another, to which she replied, \"What?\" when we asked for help, and then \"You have to ask her,\" pointing to our presumed waitress, who was sitting down at a table with people she knew. All in all, a normal burger with bad service. With all the other competition out there, I can't see myself going back.",

Of course I second guessed my choice as soon as I placed the order. It awesome. It was my unique burger.

Stack'd was kind of hard to find since it's so small, but we parked around the corner and walked over.  I like the customizable individual menus that you can mark with the pencils provided at the table, with your choice of sauces, cheeses, and toppings. I wanted to step out of my comfort zone and get the pineapple mayo in lieu of my usual honey mustard and I was not disappointed. Burger came out great, tots were great, especially for the price! Meal was easily less than $10. Ambiance was what I could have hoped for a small sports-ish bar; we enjoyed watching MMA and the US summer Olympic team trials for men's gymnastics.  What I thought was interesting was that they did not ask how we wanted our burgers cooked, so I guess all of them are medium well? I don't remember them having pink in the center, but it tasted good regardless. I would definitely recommend this place if you were walking around shopping or strolling around in that neighborhood; if you traveled out of the way specifically to eat here, keep an eye out for it because it can be difficult to find.",

After visiting  their website my husband and I were there the next week. We loved Burgatory, so we weren't sure how we would feel about this place... However, after our first visit a few months ago we have been back multiple times and take friends to experience it each time we go.   Just like Burgatory, you can create your own Burger/sandwich, but the choices are way better and everything is much bigger and the prices are amazing for the amount of food you get not to mention it tastes delicious! They have specials on different days of the week, but they always have $6 pitchers of Yuengling and $15 fish bowls.   I have yet to have their milkshakes, but hear they are comparable to Burgatory. If you love Burgatory, this is a must visit restaurant! You'll love it!!",

I am looking for a good tasting burger on a complimentary bun with toppings that make sense.    Since toppings on huge burgers is Stack'd's (?) thang, I was expecting to feel stressed and overwhelmed about what to order, then spontaneously blurting out random things that separately may be delightful but smashed together are a horrid nightmare.  This did not happen at Stack'd.  Maybe because fried mac n' cheese is good with/on/in anything?  Same with bacon and egg?  Yes, I played it safe and picked toppings that could do no wrong, but even angelic toppings could not elevate a burger than isnt good in the first place.  Stack'd has good, big, juicy burgers.  On big, hearty buns.    Great beer selection, tater tots, friendly service.  I'll take Stack'd over BRGR any night.",

They do get major points for their extensive wing sauces and ability to customize the burger in about a million different ways.   Wings - 5/5 Everything you'd expect from sports bar wings Burger - 4/5 Good burger, not great.   Drinks - Good prices. Cold beer. You can't ask for much more at a sports bar.

The \"build-your-own\" burger idea is absolutely fantastic, since there are what seems to be endless options; which is a great alternative to a simple burger at a larger, commercialized restaurant. The meal was incredible, and i highly recommend going to this establishment.",

There is tons of burger competition in Pittsburgh, but most of those places are just not in my price range.  I LOVE the personalized checks menu, and it was very clear which add-ons cost extra.  No surprises here!  I brought my brother here for his birthday, and we each ordered different burgers.  First of all, each of our half pound burgers covered in toppings were $5.50, for a grand total of $11.  The half pound burger is actually two quarter pound burgers, which I prefer.  My brother is super picky so anywhere that does not force vegetables on a burger is good by him.  He ordered the 1/2 pound burger on a sesame seed bun, with American cheese, mozzarella sticks, and fried mac and cheese.  The mozz sticks looked amazing, and my brother finished the entire burger is a matter of seconds.  I ordered a 1/2 pound burger on a sesame seed bun, with Cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, house sauce, and fried mac and cheese.  The fried mac and cheese tasted homemade, and I could have eaten a whole plate of that.  The combination was great, and the price was unbeatable.  The actual quality of the burger isn't quite five stars, but this is a great place to build your own burger!  Our server was great, and the place was really crowded.  We were in and out in forty five minutes.  The only slight detriment is that this place is small and not so shockingly gets packed.  I will definitely be back on a Tuesday night for some more burgers here!",

So, if I say I liked the burgers I had here at Stack'd...that's quite a big deal.   I'm a total cheapskate, so when I heard about the $3 specials on Tuesdays, I had to give this place a try. It was pretty packed for a Tuesday night and seemed to appeal to a more college-age crowd. There are definitely certain college-bar features: loud music, poor lighting and drunken college kids. There are two floors so plenty of seats. The service was on point. Even though it was crowded, the waitress spotted us right away and came by for our order.   The food came pretty quickly. The meat was juicy and flavorful. I really appreciate the fact that it was actual burger juice that dripped down my arm, not grease. I couldn't really taste the sauce or any of the other condiments, which isn't a bad thing because that great chunk of beef stole the show. For an extra $2, you get a handful of fries on the side. That was a total rip-off though. The fries weren't that spectacular, just your ordinary fries.       Overall, I thought it was great place to grab some late night fatty bites. For those on a budget like myself, go on Tuesdays after 9pm for their $3 burger special. With an additional $2 for fries, you're looking at only $5 for a pretty fulfilling meal. I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews for this place. I really liked it...can't beat $3 burgers.",

Also tried the 3/4 burger - bread less. I was disappointed. The burger patties were small. In addition, usually when you order a burger or sandwich most places wrap it in iceberg lettuce. Not the case here. I chose the House sauce, grilled onions, mushrooms, jalapenos, & tomatoes. I didn't ask for lettuce because I figured it would be wrapped in it. The topping ratio was good except the onions. There were barely any onions on it. Also, they only put the House sauce on the top patty, which the 3 were fanned out. The burger itself was ok. I guess I was expecting more from this place. I don't regret trying it, but I won't be back.",

I was there in October, and I wanted to try an Oktoberfest beer, and I wasn't impressed with their options.  I like Oktoberfest beers that don't taste like sugar syrup (the few and far between).    I like their fish bowl thingies, and honestly I should've ordered that with my husband, but it wasn't that sort of night.  We had somewhere to be in the morning.",

Burgers are solid but they won't be the best you've had. I'm not sure if Stack'd can really compete with other local burger joints like Burgatory (which has the same make-your-own-burger concept) or BRGR. Luckily for Stack'd, there isn't a competitor too close by. So if you're craving a burger after shopping on Walnut, this is a cool place to go.",

However, after coming here for a kick ass - and possibly one of the best in Pittsburgh - happy hour, I might just now be a stackd believer. From 4-6:30 M-F, they have half off appetizers and drafts! Their apps are generally ginormous (the nachos are big enough for at least 2 meals and cost only $4!!) The fries were curly and delicious and wings spicy and crispy.

As for the menu, the only noticeable difference was the branding of the \"stack\" when you order a cheeseburger. I ordered the half stack (1/2 lb of meat) and it was more than enough. I'd likely get the regular 1/4 regardless of hunger as you get more than enough food and an easier sandwich to eat. There are more French fry options than previously (including curly and old bay fries) the crushes menu also appears to have expanded.   If you loved Tipsy Cow as a burger joint or a place to get drinks and were sorry to see the change, have no fear as the experience remains the same other than the name (the actual cow is still on the roof)",

My friends just didn't have a good time after eating their fries in here.

It's usually never that crazy busy when I've gone, but we pretty much get there at 9 just so we don't need to wait for a table.  They're pretty decent sized burgers.

The reason I love Stack'd so much is because you can choose what toppings you want on your burger and the type of bun and cheese you want also. Everyone is happy because they can choose the exact kind of burger they want. You can also choose to add on fries or tots if you want. I recommend the Cajun fries!   Another thing that makes me love Stack'd a little more is the \"Coming to America\" reference with the McDowell sauce  Also, the staff has been excellent every time we stop in.   With all of that greatness being said.. I have Stack'd 4 stars because another component of their restaurant are their milkshakes and they could use some help. My fiance has gotten milkshakes in our past visits, but each time they're always very runny and not very flavorful. He's since stopped getting them since it was happening every time we visited.   But other than that, if you're looking for a nice greasy meal after a long night out (or not, if you're an old lady like me), then Stack'd is definitely worth a visit!",

I ordered a burger, the 1/4 pound small burger with sesame bun and a variety of topping. They do have a huge variety of toppings, but the burger itself was just ok. Not super juicy or with a lot of flavor. It also took way longer than I thought to come out. The bun was also way too big and had an almost stale taste. I'm sure it was just the type of bun, but I like mine smaller and fluffy so it wasn't to my taste. The Cajun fries were pretty good. Overall an ok place to eat and drink (my bill only came to $10.50 before tip) but not some place I would go again if I had other options. Nothing wrong with it,  but nothing great.",

Took hour and half to get food and then the burger came out chopped up and cold. When I approached the manager and asked him what this was, I was told if I didn't like it to not come back. Don't waste your money on this place, there are way better burger bars to go to in PGH that understand what a simple lettuce wrap is instead of bread bun. #burgatory #learnyourmarket #learncustomerservice #learntohirecompetentpeople",

We took advantage of the full bar and had a rye Manhattan ($7) and orange creamsicle crush ($8), which incorporated vodka, orange juice, and triple sec (?).  We had a 1/2 pound burger with ketchup, mustard, and mayo, and 4 free toppings (pickles, grilled onions, tomatoes, and spinach) ($7.50).  Finally, our side of fries ($2) brought our total to $26.22, which is a big bargain for the quality of the food and drinks, and the attentive service.  Check it out!",

I suggest you to occupy one of those cabin seating that has a TV. It was a good experience.  We ordered milkshakes, drinks, fries, chicken tenders and fried pickles. Everything was great. The Cajun flavored potato fries are the best fries I ever had. I will go back for those fries again after completing this review!",

The environment/decor confuses me because it's somewhere between bar environment where dirtiness/upkeep is somewhat expected and fancy env where I'd expect cleaner, better ambience.  The staff were not very attentive and when we walked in we sat a table that was just vacated. I'd expect the staff to see that the table still needed some cleaning/wiping but we had to ask for these things to be done. At least for that night, they didn't seem to check up on us enough to at least to see what else we needed.  Lastly, this one is an easy fix, but they don't seem to read the menu that customers fill out in full. If you order something on both sides, make sure you let them know you have something on the other side (eg appetizers are on one side of the sheet, while burgers and the main sandwich is on the front). They missed our order for onion rings.",

    "text": "I'm not really sure you should call yourself a place that specializes in burgers when the burger meat only comes medium-well.  I take that as either the cook isn't confident enough in his abilities or the management isn't confident enough in the quality of the meat to not poison the clientele.  Because of this, Stack'd automatically lost one star before even I even ordered.    There are a few other things that Stack'd needs to improve upon.  First, while there is a pretty good Yeungling pitcher special on weeknights, the rest of the happy hour isn't really that great (only $1 off drinks).  Second, apparently there wasn't a server in the upstairs area, so if you want to order food or drinks, you either have to sit at the bar or keep going up to the bar to order.  Third, if it's quiet in the bar, there is some awful game in the back that plays the most annoying little tunes every few minutes.  To some, that might not even be something to notice, but for someone who cringes at loud, unexpected noises like that, I found it unsettling.  Now for the reasons that Stack'd salvages a 4th star... The kitchen is actually open until 1 am, which if you've ever found yourself looking for a damn open kitchen in Shadyside after 10 only to be disappointed, this is a big deal.  The bartender was really friendly and made sure we were well taken care of.  There are many, many TVs (including a TV in each booth) and if you're an out of town football fan who can't get the game at home (think Eagles, Raiders, etc.), you will be able to find your game playing - and you won't even get harassed for not being a Steelers fan.  Finally, the restroom was probably the nicest in Shadyside so that wins big points with me.  Overall, I would most certianly go back, but I truly hope the ownership reconsiders its policy on buger cooking!",

Burgers are cooked medium-well and aren't made out of fantastic meat, but are consistent and solid, and never bad. You can order whatever you want, and get a generous number of toppings for free. The check-the-box-style ordering is nice, since you get exactly what you want, no matter how weird (three types of lettuce, for instance).  Service is fast and good.

Indeed, I often miss the Fuddrucker's down by the Waterfront for this reason; they had fantastic buns. (side note - screw you owner of Pittsburgh burger company, for taking over the Fuddrucker's location and then TOTALLY messing that up).  I still think Tessaro's has the best burger in town.

Our waitress was super polite and attentive. The amount of toppings to choose from in order to build your burger was awesome. They pretty much have every topping you could think of, plus more. As for the actual food, eh.   We ordered the mac and cheese bites for an appetizer and they were really good, so I guess if I could give a half a star, that would be worth a half. It was served with a spicy ranch dressing that had a ton of flavor and was great for dipping.   For our burgers, I had a hamburger on a kaiser roll with cheddar cheese, garlic aioli, lettuce, tomato and grilled onions with a side of fries. The garlic aioli was really tasty but the actual burger was disappointing. It was dry and tasteless and you can tell they don't really use quality beef. The french fries were just regular ol' fries, and I was really hoping for fresh cut ones seeing as they do so many homemade sauces. My husband had a hamburger on a wheat roll with ketchup, house sauce, hot pepper relish, cheddar cheese, lettuce and red onion with a side of onion rings. He thought the same thing, the toppings were great but the actual burger really lacked in taste, making the whole burger really unenjoyable. We both agreed afterwards that we much prefer burgers from 5 Guys and that's practically a fast food restaurant!  All in all, unless the quality of the burger meat improves dramatically, I can't see us every going back.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I love the food here. However, when my friends and I visited Stack'd this previous Wednesday - Thanksgiving eve - I was surprised by the poor service, and the waitress's unwillingness to serve us at all. When we walked in around 11:30 pm, the downstairs bar was fully seated, and a few tables were filled. We sat down at a booth to order some burgers and appetizers. The waitress working that night promptly told us that orders were only being taken from the bar, she wasn't serving to tables. I was surprised by this because it was still early and I know that they usually stay open until 2 like other bars. So we walked up to the busy bar and were able to place our food order there. We went back to our booth and I heard her telling a friend that she was trying to close up early. It was only around 11:30, but this explains why she didn't want to serve us. She seemed annoyed when she delivered our food (one of the burgers was made wrong), and rolled her eyes at us when we requested things like more water, ranch dressing, etc. When we were finished, she hurriedly cleaned off our table and delivered the check. After we paid, we were waiting at the booth for our ride to come pick us up. We were the last ones downstairs (around 12:30 am), and we could tell she was waiting for us to leave. So, we gathered our things and waited in the doorway while she locked up the downstairs dining room and ran out with a couple of friends. I was so shocked that she blatantly tried to avoid serving us, was unhappy when she did have to provide us service (during normal working hours of the bar), and was closing down almost 2 hours before the restaurant even closed. The food was good for the most part - but the experience was uncomfortable.",

I pretty much only go here for half-off burgers, but I've been here a few times for full-priced food. The food isn't all that great, so my review is essentially: for a half-price burger, it's awesome! But for a full-price burger, it's ok.  They make you get the burger well-done and don't ask a temp. For people that actually like burgers, that can be kind of a deal breaker. But you can choose your bun, toppings, etc, and add fries for just a buck! They are also one of the only places that offers peanut butter burgers. I love a peanut butter burger with iceburg lettuce, fried bananas, and pineapple mayo. Seriously so good.  The fries are always just a TINY BIT too salty for my tastes. And I looooove salty fries, so that really speaks to how much they tend to over salt them.  The beer pitcher deal is great. I think it's 6 bucks for a pitcher of Yuengling. The service is always friendly. They've messed up our orders a few times, but when we're paying half-price, we don't even bother complaining. It's just not that big of a deal.  All in all, decent place, decent service, AND I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER BURGERS.  Oh, also, for the vegetarians of the world, the veggie burger is pretty good. Nice and crispy! Nom nom!",

For my burger, I had a stacked burger with ranch, jalapenos, and fried Mac and cheese. The meat was juicy and the flavors came together well. The tater tots were crispy and so full of flavor that I forgot about the ketchup.",

There is one waitress in particular who is my favorite, and the next time I go I will write her name up here because she is fantastic.

    "text": "OK I gave this place a 4 some time ago. I want to change my opinion now, it's a 5.  This place serves $6 double burgers. You get to choose the bread, the sauce, and up to 4 toppings (which is usually enough). Cheese and special toppings (eggs, bacon, chicken fingers, peanut butter, fried bananas...) are not free, so if you want to add those, it's going to cost more, but still below $10 usually. The burgers taste very decent for $6. I've been to Burgeratory, and they serve pretty much the exact same burger for twice the price.  If you consider the specials (Monday night $5 wings, Tuesday night $3 double burgers, Wednesday night $3 veggie burgers, and the drink specials) this place is very, very well priced. Be sure to order between 9-12 though. I think one of my orders went in at 8:55PM and it was full price.  Their milkshake is also really good. I know it's $5, but since their burgers are so cheap, I'm okay with this. And it's still cheaper than Burgeratory, which serves milkshakes of the exact same quality anyway.  Asides from the burgers, other food are just okay, and they're usually not as valuable as $6 burgers. They're probably still pretty cheap compared to places like Shady Grove and Mario's that are not far away though.  Environment's fine, never seen it dirty, bartenders are nice, and there are always sports shows on the screens. On Tuesday nights the place is super crowded. I've seen parties lining up at the door. Other times are okay.",

    "text": "My wife and I were in the Shadyside area today and were looking for a place to eat lunch because we couldn't find parking around Pitt's campus. We were walking down the street and saw Stack'd and I gave Yelp a quick look and saw some good reviews so we walked in.  First off, we were only on the first floor so I'm not sure how much is upstairs but the I was concerned walking in about having a kid with us as our 2 yr old daughter was with but they had highchairs and also they had a chalkboard on the wall. However, the first floor was small. Again, maybe more room upstairs but I'm not sure.  We had fried pierogies, two burgers and my wife has fries and I had tots. Everything was delicious especially for the price. I was surprised that my burger had two patties but then realized the place is called Stack'd so two stacked patties shouldn't have been that surprising. The only thing I would have liked was a few more tots on my plate. Seemed like my wife got a lot of fries and I can't say the same for the side of tots.  Overall value here was fantastic. Great food comparable to BRGR in Cranberry but literally at half the price. We would definitely go again and are very glad we happened upon it.",

Once I had a look at the menu (featuring burgers, alcoholic milkshakes) I instantly thought of a BRGR wannabe.  However, STACK'D does set itself apart by allowing intense customization of a burger, from the bun (Pretzel buns!) to the sauces to the toppings (up to 4 for free, with traditional and \"unique\" options such as Fritos and peanut butter?)  Some more \"premiere\" ingredients such as fried mac and cheese can also go atop your burger for an extra fee.  With the option to make a perfectly customized meal, I was naturally pleased with my outcome and will give this place another try......perhaps for their $3 burger nights on Tuesdays after 9 PM!",

Here's a tip: If you want curly fries forego paying the $2 to get them on the side and instead pay $4 and order a basket.   When sharing with someone else I feel this is the perfect amount.  The veggie and regular patties have great flavor and could stand on their own - but this place is called STACK'D for a reason.  I love that you can sit down and just put a check next to every single topping you want.  I haven't tried the peanut butter on my burger yet but I like having the option.  Also, they have avocados!  As a California native I can always appreciate a place that offers avocados.  If you're craving a burger or curly fries I would highly recommend this place.  They also have quite the beer selection and offer tv screens playing whatever game you may be interested in watching.  Also, the veggie patty is MUCH better than either Burgatory and BRGR!  Best time to come is Tuesday between 9 and midnight as burgers are only $3!",

I sat all the way upstairs and the bar was quiet but it was a Tuesday night after all.  They had a great list of draft beers including Pumking which I would have normally gotten but at $10 for a small glass that was a little much for me. I ended up with a bottle of Purple Haze another favorite of mine. The bartender told me there was a glitch in the computer system and it only rang up for $3-nice surprise.  Unfortunately this didn't happen for the second round but the bartender made sure to tell me in advance which was perfectly fine.  I stayed for the 9 o'clock burger special and it was declivous.

I wish they were't so well done, but there's probably some system of patties being made and they can't customize to that level, oh well. Here's what did bug me though, I get my check and the burger was $6.50.  Me: Hey I'm wondering if you could help me add this up - I see its $6.50 Waitress: Yup, burger is $3, cheese is $1, cheese sticks are $1, and fries are $1. Me: Yeah - so that adds to $6. Where does that extra 50 cents come in? Waitress: I have no idea.  Now, whatever, its 50 cents. But its the principle. When I come back and its not a game night, I'm going to raise this issue with the manager.",

    "text": "I have been craving a burger for about two weeks now. So long that I've gone from wanting a crazy gourmet burger (aka Burgatory) to just wanting ANY DANG BURGER. Finally yesterday, a Sunday, nothing to do, I can go get my burger. I found out from the Yelp forum about this place and, as it's closer (and cheaper) than Burgatory, we decided to check it out. We are pleased.   So I have obviously been setting up this review to compare it to Burgatory because after you've eaten there, every burger place is compared to Burgatory (or Winghart's). Winghart's and Burgatory are the kings of gourmet burgers, in my opinion, but Stack'd delivers a really, really, REALLY good burger.   They offer a $6 build-your-own option. There are no options on the meat besides ground beef, vegetarian and chicken (so no bison or crazy meats) and whether you would like a double, triple or quad burger - or as big as you can possibly handle. There are a few selections on bun type, sauce, and cheese and then some great options for toppings. I went with a double provolone cheeseburger on a kaiser bun with BBQ sauce, banana peppers, grilled mushrooms, field greens, and bacon. $9. Yessss, this place is so on my price-wavelength! You can add fries for $1 or onion rings for $2, and they have regular, cajun, curly and old bay fries. The fries were my least favorite part, though. I could have done without them.  The burgers come out and they are freaking huge. Like, can't get my mouth on it to get a bite huge lol. One of my first thoughts when I was cutting it in half was that I wasn't asked how I would like it cooked. I don't know if they don't take requests or the bartender just forgot to mention, though. The burger was more done than I like (think well vs medium), but surprisingly still very juicy and tasty. I was hesitant on the banana peppers, as much as I love them, but the bartender recommended them and I am super glad I got them. They added a nice crunch and sweetness to the burger.  Their beer selection for a small place is incredible. Any place who has Pumking right now is an automatic win spot for me. The also had Magic Hat's Hex, Brooklyn Brown Ale, and a few other great selections on tap with a very good varied bottle selection.  The bartenders were friendly and it was neat being off the main road in Shadyside. Less traffic and noise. TV set up is great for catching the game, any game. I'd highly recommend this place for a lunch or game watching spot. They offer other options for food like wings and salads, but I obviously was only in the mood for a burger.",

Basically, it's a build-your-own burger, so you can choose any kind of combination you like, and you can add fries for an extra dollar or two.  The strange thing about this place was there was no option for the way you want your burger done--they have a standard and that's it.   The burger was good when it came out, but service was a little slow and there weren't that many people there. I will definitely be back when I'm craving a good burger, but honestly, I'd rather go to Burgatory (except it's really far away from Carnegie Mellon).",

We stared with an order of wings, $10 for 10 very small wings...okay I guess you don't get wings at a burger joint.  Our burgers came...both looked good and presented well, but the meat was way over cooked (no choice of doneness) and dry.  It was like the meat was pre-cooked and held in a warmer, definitely not cooked to order.  French Fries were good, fairly fresh, but a small portion.  I had two beers, my wife had water...$46+ before tip (yes we left 20%) is a lot for what we got.  I know, we should have said something while we were there, thus not a one or two star review.  Also, something small, but the entrance steps are poorly lite and one of the steps is a little tricky.  Overall not horrible, we may try a different location.",
