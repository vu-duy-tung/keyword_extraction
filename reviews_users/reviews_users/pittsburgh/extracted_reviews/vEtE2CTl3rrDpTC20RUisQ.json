    "text": "New to Pittsburgh and was craving wings one night after a long day. Tried to place an order online, but learned that they did not deliver to my place, even though I only live 2-3 miles and 15 minutes away. But this did not deter me! I decided to call the restaurant instead and place a pick up order. I ordered the \"puddle jumper\" or 10 bone in wings, half golden bbq and half 7 pepper. I also ordered a small waffle fry and a can of cherry coke. So after a very long day spent in my car, I got back in and drove through downtown Pittsburgh on a saturday night. Once I get to their location on East Carson St I found out that there is no parking to be had. This is definitely no fault of Wings Over since it is all street parking, and E Carson is a fairly busy spot for late night activities. After circling the block a few times, I parked and went in to pickup. I didn't take the time to throughly look and was handed a black bag with a few containers. After being enticed by the smell for 15 minutes, I finally got a look inside. Two boxes, no coke.  Looked at the receipt to make sure. Yep, I was charged for a coke I didn't get. Annoying, but thought the food could make up for it. Waffle fries are a fav for me, by the way. Opened up the fries. No waffle. No straight cut. Crinkle cut. You know, the ones they serve in school cafeterias. Half crispy and half soggy. Again, I consulted my receipt. Yep Sm Waf fries was written clearly. Optimistic (and still hungry), I looked at my wings box. Ding Ding! Correct order. Now, on to the food review. 7 pepper was not a sauce but a dry rub. Pretty good. Nice pepper flavor; would have liked more kick though. And the wing was well fried. The golden bbq. Just. No.  These wings were oversauced, and as a result, soggy and not crisp. The sauce was just okay. NO hint of bbq at all. It is a mustard based sauce I think. Lots of tang and oddly sweet. It was like a slightly more savory version of honey mustard sauce. Not that good. Oddly enough, in Morgantown, WV (my hometown), they have the gold sauce wings at Kegler's (a local sports bar), which is what these could have been. Mustard based sauce, with kick, AND other spices.  There are positives though. The wings are meaty and you get good bang for your buck. The dry rub was done very well. Also they make their own ketchup for the fries. It is different from reg old Heintz, which is a go to in Pittsburgh. Nice spice kick and less sweet.       Overall: Good for a pinch; great drunk food; I would dine in next time though.",

Wings are oversized (jumbo as they call it), which means you're just eating overfed factory farm chickens which is disgusting in its own right. Boneless \"wings\" are just tenders which doesn't make sense. And their orders are by the \"pound\" so unless you have a scale with you, you don't really know how much you pay for. Good variety and options but expensive for low quality. I give them credit for great service and timely delivery, but if you want wings, go to a nearby bar, it'll be cheaper and better.",

Their online ordering is easy-peasy. I ordered a hefty selection to make sure I had a nice overview on what Wings Over can offer.  The \"boneless wings\" to start with Wimpy Buffalo sauce. These aren't boneless wings; they are chicken tenders. The sauce was good, but the meat was dry, requiring lots of bleu cheese to compensate (I do love me some bleu cheese, though)!  I also sampled the Honey BBQ, 7 Pepper, and Oriental Sesame. It's True; these wings are def meatier than other places. @Curtis G. enjoyed the Honey BBQ best while I preferred the 7 Pepper dry rub. Again, these wings were OK.  I'm open to try new wing places, and I can give props to Wings Over for meaty wings and a varied selection of sauces.  However, I don't care how much meat you give me (ha ha) if it is dry and the nice sauce flavor is lost in a river of bleu cheese.",

However, I had a couple my guys in from Detroit and over the course of weekend they at least have the menu and loved every option they tried.   So as far as the food, and that's important part, they give five stars from me. To counter staff is a whole other situation altogether. They are not bad, they just seem to cool to really engage you. Again it's far from a deal-breaker but it is one of those service points that I personally find a bit off-putting.",

I got 3 different sauces because I couldn't choose - buffalo, citrus chipotle, and Jamaican jerk. They were all tasty but the citrus chipotle was my favorite. The wings are really big, too, so you're definitely fulfilled. I also ordered a Caesar salad as the side. Nice portion but not enough dressing at all. I do wish they would give you ranch or blue cheese and that you didn't have to pay for the celery. However, I ordered from Postmates, so that could've been the reason why. I'll order from here again, I love wings and these are definitely satisfying.",

The menu also has BBQ but I was here for wings.  The prices are decent 15 wings (sections not whole) for 13$. The wings are well cooked and slightly crunchy even after sauce. A nice variety of sauces and they will let you taste them all.   That brings me to the problem, the 15 piece comes with 3 sauces. We got chilli, jerk, and barbecue sauces. I wish I could describe them to you but I can't because instead of 3 different flavors they mixed the wings in the box with no division. By the time I got home there was really no way to know which was which. The resulting mixture was pretty tasty but I will make sure they don't mix them next time.",

The boneless wings still are delish & large (chicken tender size). The delivery is fast and efficient.  Service is deff hit or miss. I've had really great service somethings, but not-so-good counter service a number of times (i eat here reallllly often, so not sure of the ratio lol)   My waffle fries that I upgraded to were completely well done.

It was a self-serve place, but the cashier was nice enough to bring our food right to our table. The wait wasn't that long.   For ~$19, you get 25 wings in 5 flavors of your choice. We tried: cajun teriyaki, hot garlic, afterburner (super spicy buffalo), citrus chipotle and mustang ranch. They were sooooooo good with the right amount of sauce and crispiness. The sauce was just right...enough to cover the whole wing, not all soggy and dripping. Out of the 5 flavors I tried, my favorite was CAJUN TERIYAKI, and my least favorite was mustang ranch. Overall, it was a wonderful experience and I definitely recommend this place if you are a wings lover, because it will definitely \"wings\" you over!",

The first thing that really struck me as awesome is how it wasn't greasy!  The fries and chicken was fried to perfection.  The chicken is perfectly white meat, how they should be.

If I would have wrote a review after my first experience with this establishment it would be less stars and bitter words.  I completely love the wrap they have available here.  It is a meal unto itself.  Nothing really special about it, plain flour tortilla, lettuce, tomato and pieces of boneless wings with your choice of sauce or dry rub.  I have tried several different sauces and one dry rub.  For the wrap it is best to choose a sauce, if you get a dry rub, you will need something to dip it in, or hope that the juices from the tomatoes and lettuce will make it tasty.  You can add crinkle cut fries for $1 or seasoned waffle fries for $1.50.  As I said before, the wrap itself is more than enough for a meal.  When I get the fries with it I always feel like I'm stupid for doing so.  I can never finish both and I hate to waste it.  My friends always order the ribs from here and are never disappointed.  If I was a rib man I would be too.  They look mighty good.    (minus two stars for my first encounter with you, but plus one star because you totally redeemed yourself and credited me on my next order)",

I wouldn't really think of going to Wings Over during the day. With that being said....  Everything is just, OK.   I usually end up ordering a combo of boneless chicken wings. That comes with fries, and a drink. I always opt for the waffle fries and I add a cheese cup as well. I pass on the seasonings because in my opinion they tasted like crap and ruined the fries for me.   What I do like is the fact that you can split every 5 wings to be different flavors. So with an order of 20 wings, 4 flavors? I'd like to see that at more wing places. Their numerous styles of BBQ are great. Note, the buffalo sauces are pretty spicy in my opinion.   As for the service, the girls working behind the counter are pretty nice but overall horribly unprofessional. BUT, I mean I don't expect too much more than people goofing off at 2:30 in the morning. I feel like I would be doing the same. If you go in late like I do, please be advised there will be South Sides post bar drunks coming in.   3 stars.",

Food arrived hot and on time (they're like, just a mile from my house).  Literally everything was delicious. Excellent pepper wings.  Just the right heat!  The waffle fries were awesome.  Good blue cheese and ketchup.  Cons:  I'm unsure why I pick a dressing (blue cheese, ranch, etc) if there are no celery sticks.  It's not like anyone dips their wings into this.  Dressing is entirely for dipping veggies in and the very expensive wings did not come with this.  Garlic/parm wings tasted of wing, neither garlic nor parm, so not an iota of flavour at all other than chicken--not even salt or pepper.  Sad.  The waffle fries were in no way the flavour I asked for (garlic parm)--they were bright red and I think the were Siracha or something?  I can't fault this too much, as they were still really good.  I had a coupon that was never applied. :(  Really con:  I suspect their delivery driver rail-roaded me into an extra tip, as I'd done it online already and he specifically made a point of saying \"what about the tip?\" I'm a big believer in tipping and always do.  It's not on to have your driver ask about such a thing *at all*!!!!!!! Super bad form.  He also made me come to the street in pajamas and barefoot, when it's literally his job to come to the door and I specified \"knock loud\" so we were sure we'd hear him.  We even have a bell.  He didn't leave the street. So, I think he scammed me into basically tipping him the equivalent of 40%.  And he also *sped* down our very cramped street while texting on his way out!  WTH?  Overall, really lovely food, poor attention to detail, and you should coach your drivers to never ask about such things.  It's gauche.",

I asked what the \"normal\" spice level buffalo sauce was and they told me Red Alert was so I went with the next higher - I LOVE spicy! I like to think I have a high tolerance for spice, but this put it to the test, not in a bad way though. The Jet Fuel had a very unique spicy flavor which I liked, and they had some SERIOUS kick. The chicken pieces were really big and I liked the breading/crispness of them.  I think if/when I do go back I will try the more mild sauces as the Jew Fuel was almost too much for me, still super yummy though! This place is good for some quick wings and they have a nice variety for you to try!",

Will definitely order from them again. Just not from postmates",

    "text": "What a rip-off. Ordered the Puddle Jumper which is 2 pounds of wings and only received 1.3 pounds of wings. We were shocked by how few wings we received when we opened the container, so we weighed them on our kitchen scale. The wings Tate's OK, but they were like warm at best.   Waffle fries showed up cold and soggy.   I won't be ordering from this place again. GrubHub refunded the price of the wings, but it's 10 PM and we have three hungry people to feed, so that really doesn't help.   I also tried calling the driver, but it went straight to his voicemail. Same result when GrubHub tried to call him. Recent statistics show 1 in 4 delivery drivers or 28%, depending on what article you read, admit to eating their customers' food. Maybe our driver was the 1 in 4???",

If you're taking out, I highly recommend that you CALL AHEAD OF TIME. It takes at least 20 minutes for your order to be ready. We ordered the B-1 which was plenty for two people. You get four flavors for this option and we got west texas mesquite, honey habanero, Jamaican jerk, wimpy buffalo and we also got a side of large waffle fries with cajun. My favorite one was the Jamaican jerk as it was very flavorful and juicy. The waffle fries were so good! Next time I'll be getting cajun for my wings. Definitely worth trying this place if you love wings!",

I was skeptical getting a burger from a wing place but my coworkers assured me that it was good so I went for it. I should have stuck with my gut feeling. I was excited when I seen you can order what temperature you want your burger. I wanted it juicy and savory so I went medium rare. Cheese wasn't a option but I was ok with it since the burger was going to be juicy.  When the delivery guy came he said there was something g wrong with the burger but didn't understand the cook. I was confused but he dashed off quickly so I didn't really have a chance to ask what happened. I sat down to enjoy my delicious burger but then I saw a thin hockey puck between 2 over toasted buns. It looks like this burger walked through hell and ended up being served to me. I couldn't eat it. It was so overdone and dry even ranch dressing could ask this tasteless beast. Even the waffle fries were over cooked. They were so crunchy they just turned to dust in your mouth, after you broke a tooth biting it. For $10 I could have had something a lot better than this garbage. The burger was super thin, tasteless,and cooked very well done when I asked for medium rare. Definitely not ordering here again.",

I was given chicken tenders tossed in what seems to be a buffalo style sauce and one of their bbq sauces. I wasn't impressed with either sauces. To make things worse, my fries were cold and soggy. I paid over $25 (delivery, taxes, etc. included) for a really disappointing meal.",

We ordered boneless hot garlic wings with fries and traditional wings that were red alert.   My boyfriend ate it so fast that he couldn't move after. He always enjoys wings especially from here. I enjoyed my food as well. The wings were very yummy and the sauce descriptions really helped me decide the right one. The fries were crispy still when we got them.  The only issue we ran into was we ordered extra sauce that was honey bbq but we just got extra hot sauce. Not a big deal at except we paid for it.   We will definitely order again but actually eat them there ! If you like wings, I would absolutely suggest ordering from here.",

After contacting Uber eats, they said they couldn't offer me a refund and now my first experience has become my last! I will never use that app again nor will I ever purchase from this restaurant! What a scam! As for the taste, way too much garlic for garlic parm! there was so much seasoning in the bottom on the container!
